At the sitting of this coromittee yesterday, Mr. O'MALLEY re uested the committee to give some intimation which rnight9nave the effect of repressing the insults to which witnesses en the side of the petitioner were subjected by some of the persons who were in attendance on behalf of tho other side. On Saturday, after the rising of the committee, Sir it. O'Donnell, Mr. J. Burke, and Mr. Lynch, respectable gentlemen belonging to the county of Mayo, were not directly addressed, but were spoken at In a very insulting manner by the priest Conway. The CUwLtNY said he was not aware vhat power the committee had to interfere under the circumstances stated by the learned counsel, but the committee wese unanimous In reprobating any such conduct as that of which the learned counsel complained. Colonel NoRTHr said, if it was brought home to Conway the matter maight be laid before the House. ir.K I sLAIB had nothearda word on the subJect efore his learned friend made his statement, but he hoped the intimation of the committee would be applied equally to witnesses on both sides. Mhlr, O'ALLEY denied that any witness on the part of the sitting maember had been insulted by any one connected with thparty of the petitioner. Tueo folo-ing Fwitnesses were then called and examined by Mr; Karalake on behalf of the sitting members :- Colonel Charles Knox said he lived at Cranmore, near Ballinrobe, in which town his father owned considerable property. He took an active part in the last election on eehalf of Mr. Palmer. He bad taken art in two previous elections for Mayo, at both of whic the military were present. Up to tho Sunday before the polling the town waserfectly quiet. He was not there on the Sunday. On the Monday morning he went to the Kilnaine booth, soon after 8 o'olock. Mr. Sharkie presided. He was in the booth two or three hours, and during most, indeed during the whole of that time, the voting wont on quietly. Priests were in the bootb, but he could not say that he saw anything irregular or improper in their conduct. He saw no coercion used by them. lhe wvas in the town until about 3 o'clock. There was a good deal of noise, shouting, and cheering in the town, but he saw no violence committed. In 1852 he was a deputed magistrate. Was there at this election anything at all unusual in the state of the town ?- Not that I saw. Monday being marketday, there was a larcer concourse of people in the town. The dragoons cleared the streets at 1 or 2 o'clock on that day, They were under the charge of Mr. Shiel, the stipendiary magistrate. I saw no reason or cauee for that act. The peopleoin the streets were not committing any out- Colonel Nowr'r.-There might have been rioting which I did not see. Examination continued.-Wbile in the booth Dr. Twiss c=me up to record a vote, as he understood, for Moore and Pamer. The deputy-sheriff, Mr. Sharkie, was asked by Mr. Blake, for whom he had recorded the vote, and he answered that be had recorded it for Mr. Palmer. Mr. Blake, Mr.Palmer's agent, said the voter had votedforMoore and Palmer, and asked Mr. Sharkie to alter the vote, but he said he had recorded it, and refused. In the afternoon witness went back to the booth. The Kilmaine booth was closed for an hour on that afternoon after a discussion between the deputy-sheriff and the agents of the candidates. He saw Colonel Higgins's voters come into the Court. At former elections it had been the custom to bring up voters for the unpopular candidate under escort. His house was almost in the town, and no riot came to his knowledee during the Atonday night. On the Tuesday morning there was also shouting and hooting, but no rioting. The excitement was not more than usual at elections. He heard in the course of the day that the poll had been adjourned. He sigued a documenttaddressed to Mr. Sharkie. Mr. O'MALLEY objected to the remonstrance against the closing of the poll being put in, when the affildavits onwhich the poll was closed had been objected to and not put in. Mr. K:LRSLAnE said the remonstrance did not relate to the closing of the poU but to the conduct of Mr. Courtenay Kenny. Mr. O'MALLEY renewed his objections. The document was tobeput in inordertoarraign the conduct of Mr. Courtenay Kenny, and it had been signed by the witness without any personal knowledge of the facts to which it referred. Mr. KARsLAI5E proposed to put in the document merely to prove that a remonstrance, whether weU founded or not, was addressed to Mr. Sharkie against the conduct of Mr. Courtenay Kenny, in consequence of which Mr. Courten.ay Kenny ceased Lto act as deputed magistrate on the day in question. The CoarurrTEE held that the document could not be put in at that moment. The witness proceeded to state, in answer to further ques. tions from Mr. KARSLAIA., that the town continued in the same state during the Tuesday, and he saw no violence comn3nitted. He was about the town, but was not at the booth at the time it closed. On the Wednesday the town was also quiet, there being less crowd than on tho previous days, and the booths remnsined open until 40o'clock. He saw Colonel Higgins driving out of the town, he believed with Mr. ilutledge, a sub-sheriff, in a mail phaeton. Colonml Higgins was not molested in any way. The onlyinjury done to property in the town was the breaking of one glas in the apothecary's shop, and the scratching of Mr. Courtenay Kenny's doors A great number of electors were polled. On cross-examination by Mr. O'MIALLUY, the witness said he was not a supporter of Mr. Moore. Re was no party to. auy afrangement b7 which Palmer's split votes were given to Mr. Moore. Witness plumped for Palmer. He was a Protestant. His house stood in grounds surrounded by a wall, but he could hear shouting from the town. His hou-e was a considorable distance from Monaghan's RoteL He had canvassed the Rev. P. Conway with Mr. Palmer. He did not recollect making any arrangement with him during the election for bringing up of voters. You have spokenular an popular candidate. Does the pepular candidate mean the pnests' candiate?-Certainly; always As far a your experience goes, is it always necessary for the personsriests' candidate to have aa escoxt?-Cerany To protectthom fromthe fury of the mob?-Yes, from the violence of the mob. That mob being excited by the priests 9-I am not prepared to say that. Is it not necessary, in consequence of the influence of the priests over the mob ?-I can't say that with certainty, but I telieve It is the fact. I was assaulted by the mob at the election in 1852, but I don't remember whether Conway was present at the tiie. I don't recoUect complaining that Conway had hounded on the mob. I dare say that the placard issued by Conway on the Wednesday had great effect in quieting the town. Mr. Moore was known as the priests' candidate at the last election, and it was also known that the priests supported Mr. Palmer, but I think it very probable that Mr. Pahiner would have been returned even without their support. I believe that most of my tenants voted for Moore and Palmer. I only asked them to give one vote for Palmer, and I did not interfere with their second vote. Was it not an object with Captain Palmer's friends to get Dr. M'Halo'ssupport7-They were very glad to get any support they could. Ile believed the Archbishop did give his support to Captain Palmer. A meeting took place, at which he was prcsent, between Curly and two other priests on the one side, and Lord J. Brown and Sir Robert Bloss on the part of Captain Palmer. The priests offered to support Captain Paemsr. He could not say what support they were to give-whether or not it was to give him Mr. Moore's second votes-they were to support him generally. He believed the arrangemient to support Captain Palmer was faithfully and honestly carried outt, Ie was not present when the poll was closed for a short time on the Monday. By Colonel NOusvm.-ERe recollected that Conway had the Optiongiven him of sitting on the bench or of going aw ay; but he did not remember what Conway had done to lead to that option being given. There was no rule with rsegardfto theappointment of deputy sheriffs by the High On re-examination the witness said that he was an acting magistrate of Ballinrobe, and that in his opinionthe last clec tion was as quiet as the election in 1852. t Sir R. Bloss stated that he lived in County Mayo, and possessed considerable property near Ballinrobe. He took an aotive part for Mr. Palmer at the last election, and also for Mr. Moore in return for the support which Mr. Palmer received from that gentleman. Castlebar was very quiet on the day of nomination, and there was mruch less excitement than was usual on such occasions. He had been at three urevous elections. On the Monday morning he went to .taUinrobe with several voters. The town was very full, but very quiet when he arrived there at 9 o'clock. There were men, women, and children in the streets. Hle remained in the town until about 12 o'clock on the Wednesday. HEI was backwrards and forwards about the streets d.uring the Monday, and there was shouting and hooting i which women and children appeared to take tho oost active part; but he observed nO act of violenco. He ougnc cue town unusually quiet for an election. Military and poleo were drawn up in front of the Court-house. That was the practice atallelections. Colonel Higgins's voters were escorted to the polL No violenee was offered to them, but there was a great deal of hooting. Possibly violence would have been offered if the military had not been with them. It would have been utterly impossible at any election ho had at. tended to take voters on the unpopular aide to the oll without an escort. He stayedthatnightatColonel rknox s. The town was also quiet on the Tuesday; it was less excited than on Monday, and he saw no acts of violence. He did not see stones thrown. Some supporters of Colonel Higgins were going about the town without an eseort. It was not usual to appoint violent partisans as deputy sheri Mr. Jenuings, one of the depaty sheriffs, acted, as he thought, partially at the booth at which he was presiding, It was the custom to appoint depulty mgistrates from the friends of either candidate. He bad appied to be made a deputy magistrate, bht the High Sneriff had written in courteous terms declining to appoint him. He also declined to appoint Lord J. Brown, Colonel Knox, Mr. Geoffrey Brown, and other gentlemen who had applied to him. On the Monday a disCUssion took place with Mr. Sharkie with regard to theo adjournment of the booth. Mr. palmer's agent objected to the adjournment, the only reason for which he said was that Colonel Higgins had no voters to polL A vote was tendered, which Mr. Sharkie refused to take, and he left the booth under the impression that it was adjourned. He saw RomanCatholic prlestsinthe Claremorris booth, but he observed nothing improper in their conduct. A. large number of voters were polled on the Monday. The town was quiet on the Tueday. Troops were charging up and down the town two or three times, when, as far as he ,iad observed, nothing had occurred to render that charging irecessary. Mr. Courtenay Kenny appeared much irritated. i!jomen andi children were hooting him Mr. Courtenay Senny was a member of Colonel Xiggins's committee,and had iLaes a strong part.in'theeolonel'efavour. The town'wasqniet both on the Tuesday and on the Wednesday. By the Wed. n=aday all the excitement appeared to be worn out. He saw nothing duinag the election to indicate greater excitenient than usual on such occasions. On cross-examination witness said that Mr. Courtenay Kenny, who was a very old magistrate, voted for Palmer and Higgins. He believedthe cavalry, when they charged, were under the charge of 3ir. Courtenay Kenny. He was a Eartyto tho arngement between the priests and Captain rabner. He saw Mr. Curly several times. He had no I recollection of a meeting between himself, Lord J. Brown and Colonel Knox on the one side, acd three Roman Catholic priests on the other aide. He saw Curly, Green Hosty, and Costello on various occasions before the election. It was arranged that they were to give every support they could-to give their split votes -in fact, to Captain Palmer. Be had commnnicated with Mr. Moore on the same subject. He could not state the day on which the arraDgement was closed. He believed the resolution recommending Captain Palmerwaspublisbed after that arrangement was concluded. The publication of the resolution was not a part of the arrangement. On the morning of the poling Archdeacon Brown went with himc to Ballinrobe. Escorts were never necessary for defeated candidates. Were not escorts necessary to protect the voters from the mob?-Certainly. Do you believe that at the last or at previous elections any voters could have voted against the priests' candidate with safetyunlessunderthe protection of an escort ?-I think they would probably have been stopped without an escort. Was not the mob one-sidedl-Entirely. Priests were walking about in the mob. Was not the mob under the command of the priests ?- Not under their command, but they had great control over it. Would not Conway be a very dangerous man at the head of a mob s-No doubt. The priests have assumed, have they not, to dispose of the representation of Mayo?l-Yes, for some time past. He was aware that Mr. Moore was supported by ths priests. The county had also been canvassed by Mr. Lambert. The duty of a deputed magistrate was to preserve the peace. Those who usually obtained deputations were gentlemen of property, who, of course, had an interest on one side or the other. Depated magistrates woald be necessary to protect the voters of Moore and Palmer if they needed protection. Be did not think he was popular in Balinrobe, but his party were cheered. He required no protection from the mob. Women were sometimes dangerous, worse than the men, when they were armed with stones, in an Irish mob. The dragoons rode down the streets. Re-examined.-The women who followed Mr. Courtenay Kenny were not armed with stones. Mr. Kenny was irrL tated by their tongues-by nothing else. The voters were perfectly protected by the escort. He had heard no improper language used by the priests, and he saw nothing done by them to excite the mob. The peasantry in Ireland generally had a great affection for their priests, and in consequence the recommendations of the priests were generally adopted. He thought the priests had less influence at the last than at previous elections, because the voters went so much with their landlords-even those who were absentees. By Colonel Nocnir.-When Conway was taken on the bench in the booth he bad not been interfering with the voters, but he had been arguing with and advising the deputy-sheriff as to his duty. Re-examination continued.-At the nomination he saw no improper conduct on the part of Curly. By'Mr. PULLMN.-He acted for Captain Palmer in his interviews with the Roman Catholic priests. He had communicated with MIr. Moore on the same subject. Any arrangement he entered into was, he conceived, made for the party with whom he was acting. The Hon. Geoffrey Brown said he resided in Mayo, and was the owner of property in the neigbourhood of Claremorris, and took an aotive part in favour of Mr. Palmer. He also supportedJlMr. Mooreto a certain extent. Forthe last 20 years the county had been represented bycandidates returned by the Roman Catholic priests, with one exceptionthe first return of Mr. Moore. Since his first return Mr. Moore had been supported by the priests. In consequence of a schism in that party the gentlemen of the county had an opportunity at the last election of returning a gentleman of property as one of their represen. tatives, and they thought that Mr. Moore was, from his position and connexion. with the county, more eligible as one of the representatives than Colonel Higgins, who when he was first elected had not an acre of land in the county. The witness then proceeded to speak of the state of the county during the election, especiallyat Ballinrobe, and said that the elechton was an unusually quiet one for Mayo. At Mr. Mloore's first election two people were shot. The account he gave of what occurred at Ballinrobe during the polling substantially corroborated that which had been given by the previous witnesses. In his opinion the military were ordared to clear the streets for the purposes of the petition. That was his impression at the tume. He thought that the arrest of Conway, which had been talked of, would, perhaps, have excited the mob and led to a riot when up to that time no riot had occurred, and ho therefore thought it would be well for Conway to keep out of the way. Between the time when the streets were cleared and the close of the poU (about an hour) the people were perfectly quiet. The excitement was over. He was in Ballinrobe about 1 on the Wednesday morning, when there was not a soul in the streets. On the Wednesday the polling was very slack, and even the shouting had ceased. lonel Higgins drove out of the town in an open phaeton. He saw Mr. Yhew walking quietly about the town on the Tuesday before the close of the poL Phew wan a Roman Catholic prlest who supported Colonel Higgins. 1r. Tighe and other supPorters of Colonel Higgins were walking about in the usual way, without an escort. Witness saw the deputy-sheriff refuse votes without any possible reason. One vote was refused because the voter mispronounced Captain Palmer's name. He saw Mlr. Isidoro Burke nearly push a man off the pavemeut head -overheels The voters folloved the landlords almost exclusively at the last election. The landlords were usually glad to get one vote, and the tenants gave the other, as they call it, " to the country" (la.ughter); but at the last election many plumped for Colonel Higgins. Cross-examined by Mr. O'MALLSY.-In his opinion the pziests wero unusually quiet at the last election. He was surprised at tbeir being so quiet. (Laughter.) Did you hear any altar denunciations ?-Oh, they always take place. I am a Protestant, and therefore have never heard them myself. At this election the priests appeared to have lost a great deal of their influence. He should think there were not more than 200 people in the streets of Bat- tinrobe on the Tuesday. The priests were thore, but not parading uand down with the mob. There were priests t____ about on Monday. There were no priests with tne mob on Tuesday. There were people with Conway, but Conway, wherever he moved about, had a lot of Ballinrobe scoundrels foUowing him. (Laughter.) The military and police were no doubt necessary for the protection of Colonel Higgins's voters on the Monday. Be was surprised at the little assistance the priests gave to Captain Palmer's party. It was after the publication of Conway's placard that Colonel Higgins went away without an escort. Mr. Tighe was a supporter of Colonel Higgins, but he also voted for Moore. There was not a single person hurt in BaUinrobe during the election. Not more than ono person's head was broken. (Laughter.) He never saw or heard of anything of the kind. Ro-examined.-He did not see Conway or any other priest commit any act of violence during the election. Colonel NORTH.-W ere the priests taking an active part with the mob ?-They were bringing up freeholders in the usual manner, bat they used no violence. Colonel Kxox said he wished to make an explanation with re&ard to his statement as to the interview with the three prests. Sir Robert Bloss was not at the meeting of which he had spoken. Mr. James Jordan, a Romaan Catholic gentleman, residing on his own property, and a supporter of Captain Palmer, said he was at the chapel at Bohola on the 29th of March, when the Rev. Mxr. Hallgan officiated. MIr. Halligpn after mass addressed the flock. He said they were aware that there was au election about to take place, that there were three candidates, that he thought he was bound to offer the people his advice, and that bis advice was to follow Moore and Palmer. He added that they had supported Higgins on two former occasions, but he had deceived them, and they had determined to give him no further support ; that he had no interest in the election, and that the people might judge for themselves as to whom they ought to support. He also said that Mr. Moore and Mr. Palmer were in favour of tenant right. He did not speak violently; he was not capable of doing so. Mr. M'Manus got up to address the people, but was told that he could not speak in the church, and be spoke to the people outside the church. It was very usual for Roman Catholic clergymen to sddress their Rocks on other than religious subjects. On the Tuesday before the nomination witness went through Swinford with Mr. Moore, for the purpose of canvassinz. When Mr. Curran addressed Mr. Moore, Mr. Moore told tEe people that they would not advance his interests by making a disturbance, The Rev. Mr. M'Ivor was present, and he had a smal cano in his hand not bigger than a pen, but he did not floe the people with it. Mr. Eames, the Protestant rector of Ewinford, supported Colonel Higgins, and was standing at Colonel Higgins s hotel. As MEr. Mloore passed the hotel the people began to hoot, and a jug of water was brought out by a waiter, who appeared to threaten to throw it at Mr. Moore. Witness called upon MIr. Moore to bail the two mren wAho had been committed by Colonel Higgins. The witness then narratend Arcthdeao,n Cog,hlanes address to the people, ando deniedF that he (witnos) a said on that occasion tiat if Colonel Higgins was there he would daub his face with the dirt of his feet. Be knew Lavin. Lavin was not, he believed, a freeholder of the county. Witness bad taken freeholders in cars to Swinford on the day of the polhing. Dunleary was one of them. He paid witness 28. a-year rent. A large crowd collectedround the car in which Dunleary was, and a numberof men took hold of Dunleary by the collar and pulled him away. He saw Mr. J. Strick. land among the people, also Mr. G. J. O'Malley and Mr. Saafo, a marate, all of whom were supporters of Colonel Higgins. The freeholders ran away through the crowd. He saw Dunleary at the poll among Colonel Higgis free. holders. Captain Brabazon. a sapporter of Colonel Hig. gins, was the deputy sheriff. Dunleanr voted for Colonel iggins and Mlr. MIoore. Colonel itiggins voters were polled on the platform; but Moore and Palmer's voters were not allowed on the platform. The witness then stated the circumlstances under which the charge against Cavanagh was made to MAr. Currn. He also said that Messrs. Mloore and Palmer had no committee-room at Armstrong's HoteL At the conclusion of tho witnes'ss examination in chief The Committoe adjourned until this day. BURY. At the sitting of this committee yesterday RCobert Kay, a butcher at Bury, stated that on the Saturday before the election Mr. Thomas Borrocks came to his shop and asked him either to vote for Mr. Philips or to go into Yorkshire for a month, He refused to do so, and Mr. Horrocks then said if be did als he desired he wouldt see that an amount of R., owed to him by a man named Ashworth for meat, which he had distributed after the election of 1852, should be settled; and threatened that if he did not he would call in a sum of 3901. which Ray owed him, and which he had not mentioned for two years. Witness voted for Peel, and after the election Mr. Horrocks required him to py the money, and he paid it. In cross-exarination by Mr. MONx, the witness stated that he got the money from Mr. Newbold, who voted for mr. Peel. He applied to Mr. Whitehead, theagentfor this petition. Josiah HaSeltine, a pipe maker and voter for the boro1 h of Bury, stated that having promised to vote for Mr. Peel he on the day of election went to Balton. About 2 o'clock in the afternoon four men, named Talbot, Shepherd, Sykes, and Nuttall, came to him and said he must go with them to Bury, and vote for Mr. Philips. He refused for some time, but at last, after Talbot had forced two halfcrowns upon his wife, and Sykes had promised him that if he voted for Mfr. Philps he should have anything he wanted then or thereafter, he went with them in a carriage to Bury and voted as they desiTred. Before doing! so he ascertained that Mr. Philips was 28 a-head. Hadit been a close poll be should have voted for Peel, but as that gentleman had no chance. he thought he might as well vote for Phillps. In cross-examination, he stated that the 5s. did not Induce him to vote. In re-examination, he said that an attorney named Crosslnd, one of the agents for the sitting member, had told him that if he gave evidence that he had received either money or drink he would be liable to a penalty of 501. Ann Haseltine, the wife of this witness, confirmed his evidence. John Moorhouse, a moulder, and a voter for the borough of Bury, stated that on the nomination day a mea named I John Harris showed him a handful of silver and challenged him to go to Liverpool for * spree. He declined to go, and another man named Pennington, said that if he did not they would be putting something into his ale which would make him go to sleep and not wako until after the election. He afterwards went with Harris to Liverpool, and remained there until the Sunday night. Harris left him on the Saturday. Before going he, at witness's request, gave hima half the money which he had left-about 5s. James Rostorn, labourer, Bury, stated that early on the morning of the nomination day WiUiam Wood, manager for Mr. Hutchinson, cotton-spinner, told him to tell his father, who earned only 25s. a-week, that if he would vote for Mr. Philips he would give him 32s. per week. He gave the message to his father, who had promised to vote for Mr. Peel, and therefore refused to comply with Wood's nies Rostorn, the father of this witness, proved that he received Wood's message from his son. He voted for Mr. William Eindell was caleld for the purpos, of proving agency but nothing satisfactory to the committee had been eliciteaw from him when the hour of adjournment arrived. MAIDSTONE. This committee re-assembled at half-past 1L The election auditor, Mfr. Beale, stated that the expenses of the sitting members at the last election amounted to 8301.; those of Messrs. Lee and Mildmay amounted to 8011. A butcher named Orford, who had voted for Lee and Mlildmay, said that previous to the election Stephen Doe (alleged to be an agent of the sitting members) asked him how hle was going to vote, adding, " I have 15. for you, if that is of a.y use." Witness said he did not want it. On the Monday before theelectionhe was asked byDoe whether he had got his money. Witness asked, "What money i" And Doe replied that he believed Lee had given them all 121. Witness said if Doe would give him his 12W. at once he woould go his way. Doe said he could not give it tiUl the following Monday. On cross-examination be said he was not serious when he stated that he would go his way for 124, but he believed Doe was not joking in offering it. Mrs. Emily Coleman, wife of Edward Coleman, a gardener, proved that Marley had canvassed with Messrs. Hope and Scott. William Smyth was caUed to prove the agency of Goodwin and Marley. George Gower was recalled and examined with respect to a letter he had received from Mr. Giles, showing that there was a considerable arrear of rent. Gues before writing the letter told him that he would be a d-d fool if he did not get his rent paid for his vote. Be considered his arrears all settled as soon as he had voted. (Laughter.) In answer to Mr. PniISx the witness said he could often have paid his rent, but that he allowed it to get into arrear when he heard that Messrs. Hope and Scott intended to stand, because it was an understanding in Maidstone that when there was a contested election the voters should get 101. a-head. This witness was a member of the Constitutional Society, and stated that Messrs. Hope and Scott had attended a meeting of that society before the election, at which p700 or 800 people were present, when a great dealof drink was consumed, and he did not know who paid. for it. Other witnesses having been examined to prove treating at various publichouses, the petitioner's case was dosed, and Mr Serjeant PiaorT addressed the committee on behalf of the sitting members. He submitted that no case of treating had been made out, inasmuch as proof of agency had failed. Then, was there any evidence as to bribery ? He contended that there was not. oi the contrary, the evidence showed that the expenditure at the last election was very moderare, and quite legal and proper. At the conclusion of the learned counse's address, The committee adjourned until this day. OXFORD (CITY). The first witness called yesterday was Thomas Evans, a boot and shoe maker, who had votedfor Langston and Card- I wel He said, that on the 17th of March Mr. Neate made a speech to a meeting at the Horse and Jockey and his health wasi drunk as the candidate. Beer was brought in, and he did not see any one pay for it. The meeting consisted principally of voters. Other witnesses were called to speak to the same facts, and it was proved that the beer was put down to the account of a person named Greenwood. James Hoele and" John Jennings gavo evidence as to another meeting at the Hineo's Head, at which Mr. Neate was present, when beer was supplied to and notpadfob opsfor by those who drank it. The landord of the Hine's Head, Edward Hine, stated that the beer was paid for as it was John Althorp said he was with other voters at the Butchers' Ams on the Tuesday before the election, and Wa there canvassed by Mr. Neate, who was accompanied by Messrs. Green, Freeman, and Walsh. Some of the voters said they would not promie to vote unless they had some beer. Five quarts were then brought in, of which witness andthe other voters partool, hut for which tho did not pay. Three of the voters then promised to vote for Mr. Neate. Mr. Freeman put down some money urpon the table. Benjamin Stone stated that be had accompanied seven other voters from Abingdon, where he resided, to Oxford. They breakfaWsted at Abingdon and dined at Oxford, without paying f or either meal, and they voted for Neate and Lang ston. Mlr. Freeman had canvassed him on behalf of Mr. ;ekate, and told him that there would be a conveyance to WilliamTaylor, the landiordof the RedLion, atAbingdon, proved that the breakfast to which the preceding witnes referred had been ordered by Greenwood, to whom witness had sent in his bilL He had also supplied an omnibus to convey the same voters to Oxford. Sarah Carter, a servant at the Maidenhead Inn, kept by Greenwood, proved that people had helped themselves to bread, cheese, and beer at that inn during the election without payinig for it. Further evidence was then given as to the" 1Maidenhead." One witness, Hughesden, who lived at Horton, stated that he had got 1. at Neate and Langston's committee-rooms for his own and his brother's expenses in going to Oxford, that he had paid his brother 5s. and kept the rest, and that he had plumped for Neate. In cross-examination he stated that he voted for Mr. Neate at the desire of Lady Crook, whose tenant he was: Mr. OCLXRK summed up the case on the part of the petitioners, submitting that it had been proved that a number of voters had voted for Mr. Neate In pursuance of an understanding that they should receive remunerations as messengers an d constables, and that money had been paid them for which no services had been rendered. Treating had also been proved to have been practised on an extensive scale. The committee then adjourned until this day.
EXECUTION FOR MURDER. Yesterday Thomas Mansell, a private in the 49th Re ment, who was convicted, at the last winter assires for the county of Kent, of the murder of Alexander i'Burnie, a corporal in the same regiment, by shooting him, was ex. ecuted at Maidstone. Seven months have elapsed since theprisoner's conviction, but the delay in the execution of the sentence has arisen from the attempts made to set that conviction aside upon a writ of error. The arguments upon eachoccasion have been reported in The Tima. The judges having decided against the objections taken by the prisoner's counsel the sentence was ordered to be carried into effect yesterday. .Tha psoner2retired to rest about 11 o'clock on Sunday night, Dut hegotnup early and dressed himself, andthen, for the first time, appeared to feel his awful position. Upon seeing the Ordinary and the Governor of the prison he shook hands with them and thanked them for their kindness, asked them to forgive him for the trouble he had given the and for the manner in which hoe had actedupon several occasions. He then requested that his Crimean medal might be given to one of the officers of his regiment, and he was assured that hia request should be complied with. A few minutes before 12 o'clock, Mr. Wildes, the Under. sheriff of Kent, accompanied by some of his officers, arrived at the gaol, and proceeded to the cell where the prisoner hadbeen confined. Caloraft, the exeoutioner, shortly afterwards commenced the task of oinioning the culprit, to which he submitted without makhng any observation. The prisoner, who is 29 years old, and who has allowed his beard and moustaches to grow during the whole period since his conviction, did not betray the least emotionduring the process, and when the prison clock commenced striking 12 he turned round to Mr. Hillyard and said, in a very cool manner, "Are you not a little behind time?" The usual procession was then formned, and the culprit walked with a firm step towards the place of execution. The moment he emerged from the gaol and took his place on the scaffold he cast an earnest look at the crowd, and then proceeded to mount the ladder to the drop. Caicraft took hold of one of his hands to assist him, but he exclaimed, "I don't want that," and ran uO the ptels of his own accord. The executioner then pLaced tho cap over his eyes and adjusted the noose, the drop fell, and the culprit appeared to be dead in an instant. The crowd, which was much smaller than usually assembles upon these occasions, conducted themselves in the most orderly and decorous manner, and it was observed that there were very few women among the spectators. The body, after hanging an hour, was cut down and placed in a shell, and buried in the course of the day within the gaol.

GEOOtGf STsmmso= Aim =n Dnx.-Thouglz mainly an engineer, he wa3 a*so a darinz thinker on many ecientific questions and. there was scarcely a subject of speculation or a depurinent of recondite scienco on which he had not employed his faculties in such a way as to have formed large and original views. At Drayton (at Sir Robert Peel's, in 1845) the oonversation often turned upon such topics, and Mr. Stephenson freely joined. in it. On one occaslon an animated diusSon took place between himself and Dr. Bucldand on one of his favourite theories as to the formation of coal; but the result was, that Dr. Bucldand, a much greater mater of tongue-fence than Stephenson, completely slenced bim. Next morning before breakfast, when he was walkdng in the gounds pondering, SlrWilliam Pollett came up and asked what he ws thinking about. 'Why, Sir Willam, I am thin}kig over that argument I had with Buldland last night. I know I am right, aud that if I had only the command of words which he has rd have beaten him" Let me know all about it,' said Sir William, an I'll see what I can do for youn" The two sat down in an arbour, where the astute lawyer made himself thoroughly acquainted with the points of the case, entering into it with all the zeal of an advocato about to plead the dearest interests of his client. After he had mastered the subject Sir William rose rxubbing his hands with glee, and said "Now I am ready for him." Sir Robert Peel was made acquainted with the plot, aud adroitly introduced the sub. ject of the controversy after dinner. The result was that in the argument which followed the man of science was overcome by themanof law, and Sir William Follett hadat al points the mastery over Dr. Bitkland. "What do you sa ad. Stephenson?' asked Sir Robert, hu hing. ic y,, adhe, "I WMh only say this,-that ofI1 the. powers above and under the earth, there seems to me to be no power so great as the gift of the gab."-Lifc of Gcorgc =X PRG.-The, King of Prussia has forwarded to Mr. Henry Bradbury the lago PrussiAn gold medal, with an autograph letter, in ackmowledgment of his efforts in the prooess of nature ~rintin 1. ~otAd.vertiement.1-.1 Life In Matns by the Rev.

MONEY-MAARKETand CITYINTELLIGBNCB. Monday Evening. ! The funds show a total absence of any symptom I of revival, most persons being disposed to guard ! against the contingency of the arrival of more un favounable news from India on blonday next, while political uneasiness is excited also in other qiarters by the universal and still increasing distrust on the 'aris Bourse. Consols, which left off yesterday at 922 to ~, opened this morning at 92i to i, and subsequently went to 924. At the close, howvever, there waa more steadiness, and finally transactions again took place at f.J2& to i. This was the first transfer-day in the stocks lately shutS and, as usual on such occasions, several sales were made. For the new account on the 6thof Augtust the last price was 93. Bank Stook left off at 214 to 214, Reduced 924 to :, New Three per Cents. 92E to 0, Exchequer Bonds 98k, India Bonds lOs. to 5s. discount, and Exchequer-bills 3s. discount to par. The rate for advances in the Stock-Exchange today ranged between (; and Gi per cent. In the discount-market and at the Bank there was a moderate demand, with signs of approaching ease. The market for foreign securities has been dull, at prices slightly fluctuating from those of yesterday. ln Peruvian the effect of the recent convention for securing the guano proceeds has been further maanifested in an additional rise of 24 per cent. Brazilian Four-and-a-half per Cents. have been negotiated at 961; MIexican, 22 ; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents. for the account, 82, 83-, 84; ditto Three per Cents. for the account, 54 7; Portuguese, 45; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 98, 96-; Sardinian, S9t A; Spanish, 40& i.; ditto certificates, &, C; Turkish Six per CDents., for the account, fQ, 9G, and 96P; ditto Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 1024; and Dutch Four per Cents. 98. The corn~-market was dull this morning, and sales could not have been pressed except at a decline of between le. and 2s. The telegraphic advices from the Paris Bourse again show increasing heaviness in aU departments of business. Although the accounts of many weak holders were compulsorily closed during the liquidation just terminated, the market seems more gloomy than ever, and bas left off this evening at a further decline of an eighth, the final transactions in the Three per Cents. being at 67f. IOc. for money and 67f. 20c. for the new account at the end of the month. These are within a quarter per cent. of the lowest prices touched during the present year. About 80,0001. in gold was sold to the Bank today. Nearly 15,0001. is from Russia, and the remainder from Australia. Further amounts are expected to be taken there to-morrow, some recent orders from Paris having been countermanded. The private letters from Paris state that the stock of bullion in the Bank of France, which had recently been diminished by the demand for Italy, is again increasing, and that it is expected the next return will present no material variation from that of last month. The Persian, like the French Government, are stated to have become alarmed at the drain of silver, and to have adopted the same futile means for arresting it-the issue of a prohibition against its exportation. In the Court of Queen's Bench to-day, whither it had been carried from the Criminal Court to be tried before a special jury, the important prosecution instituted by the Bank of London against Lawson and another for a conspiracy to injure the credit of the establishment and extort money resulted in the parties being sentenced respectively to a year's imprisonment. The punishment is extremely severe, but an example had become necessary. There is no more easy way of spreading ruin than that of attacking the credit of a bank, and nothing that requires greater courage for its repression. For some time past the accounts of the operations in the New York stock-market have furnished increased illustrations of a fact whicb, although of great importance as a stimulus to caution, has never been much noticed by European investors. The rules of the London Stock-Exchange constitute a model system for the maintenance of honourable dealing, and capitalists who look in the Americaa papers for the official price-lists and other documents emanating from the Board of Brokers in New York are apt to suppose that some. thing like similar vigilance is exercised by that body. This, however, is a mistake, and not only is it a fact that the managers of the New York Exchange encourage a system of business which has no bowl fide foundation, but that the members of that Exchange, instead of acting as one man, like the London dealers, on all oecasions when it may be necessary to insist upon a rigid maintenance of public credit, usually put forth their collective iniluence to obtain an opposite result. With rare exceptions the policy of the New York dealers and speculators is always to act against the market. Whether this arises from a large portion of the stocks and bonds of American companies being held by foreigners need not be discussed. Certain it is that, while in London the least attempt at bad faith on the part of a public company is at once emt on the Stock-Exchange as an evil that would be destructive to business of all kinds, the tendency at New York, owing to the majority being largely interested in speculations for a fall, is to give tacit, if not active encouragement, to every proceeding that can produce distrust. Thus, In the case of the New York and Newhiaven Railway, where the frauds of Schuyler in issuing falsestockwereanalogous to those of Sadleir, Redpath, and Robson in London, the directors felt suflicient confidence in public support to repudiate the acts of their officer, and to drive the claimants into a court of law. In like manner, if the president of a bank, after boi-rowing money in England, pleads ustury to avoid payment; or the head of a trust-company-a leader in a certain section of the religious world-gets control of its funds in order to squandor them through years of litigation with shareholders on this side; or a Secretary of State openly announces himself the advocate of repucliation, and laughs at the "crocodile tears" of the sufferers, their popularity in the precincts of the New York Exchange never zeems for one moment influenced. The leading merchants of the city feel the disgrace and loudly condemn it, but so long as those who gain by such practices can find themselves still admired in the sphere where their profits are made the opinion of other classes has little weight. It will be rightly said, however, that for this there is no remedy. The managers of the Board of Brokers have nothing to do with the sympathies of the members, either individually or collectively. All that the European investor has to do is to recollect that the fact of these feelings, being in many cases against him, should be one element of his calculations. But there are other points with which it is in the power of an official body to deal. The Board of Brokers can at least decide upon the character of the transactions they will permit to appear in their authorized stock lists. In London no operation is allowed to be marked unless it is for a certain amount, and to be settled within a certain reasonable time-a fortnight in the case of shares and fore' stocks, and a month in the case of Consols. In New York, on the contrary, when it has been arranged to create a panic, one of the favourite devices is to sell at about one-fourth of their actual money price a few hundred dollars worth of shares, to be delivered a twelvemonth hence. A holder of Great Western stock at 65 would feel no little consternation if he were to see in to-morrow's list that several sales had been effected at 20. This kind of tactics, however, is daily permitted in America. Even where it is understood it creates uneasiness, and, of course, "pon the ninitiated abroad the effect is alarming. By risking $500 in this way the speculator, perhaps, contrives to realize 45,000 on some immediate transaction. To ordinary men of business such proceedings must seem more fit for the betting ring than for a financial body -whose operations largely affect the interests of almost all civilized communities. It is for the Board, however, to decide on their own methods. The only thing necessary here is to take care that those methods are not supposed to be such as prevail among ourmelves. The trade of the various manufacturing towns appears, on the whole, to be steady. At Manchester during the past vweek theamount of business has been only moderate, but the market continues firm from decreased production. A few experimental purchases seem to have been made for Russia under the new tariff. For India there would apparently be a fair demand, but buyers hold back, waiting the next news. At Birmingham the termination of the quarter is usually a quiet period, but the price3 of iron are well maintained, and large orders are expected, owing to the reduction of duty in the United States. In the general trades of the place there has been no alteration, but prospects are considered' good, the ptocku in dealers' hands throughout the country bsixi; low. To Nottinghanm report de- seribes dulnes3',)ofh as rogards hosiery and lace. In the 'woollen d1stricts the transactions have been oi1 an average scale. The Irish linen markets are inactive. A cii:ctular to the shareholders of the Western Bank of London has been puit forth by Mr. J. S. Ryrner, wshose connexion with that establishm,nt as solicitor has been summarily terminated. Mr., :Rymer alleges a number of irregularities on the part of the Board, and that his dismissal has beea consequent upon his having protested against them. I The shareholders of the Arican Steamship Cornpany have been addressed in a printed letter by MlIr. C. W. Gregory, an ex-director. Mr. Gregory disputes the correctness of the accounts submitted at the meeting on the 24th ult., and attributes the unfavourable result of recent operations mainly to the removal of the business of the company from London to Liverpool. The general business of the port of London during the past week has shown increased activity, the change of wind having enabled the vessels overdue to work up the Channel. The total number of ships reported inward was 248, being 95 more than in the previous week. The number cleared outward was 11.5, including seven in ballast, showing a decrease of 17. The total number on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 66, being the same as at the last accorunt. Of these, eight are for Adelaide, three for Geelong, four for Hobart Town, three for Launceston, one for Melbourne, seven for New Zealand, 23 for Port Philip, four for Portland Bay, 11 for Sydney, and two for Swan River. The Stock-Exchange Conimittee have appointed the following settling day:- "Berlin Waterworks, new sbares, Friday, the l0thinst., and to be quoted in the official list.

The following notice has been posted on the Stock-Exchange: "Paris and Lyons, and Northern of Prance.-In order to enable parties to claim the new shares in the above companies it has been ordered by the committee that aU bargains for the 16th be settled on the lOh." The followinc is from the late Secretary of the London Dock Company:- "Ramsgate, July 4. t" Sir,-In your City Article of to-day it is stated, in reference to the London Dock meeting which took place on Friday, that I had retired from the office of secretary of that Company in consequence of iU health. As this is calculated to convey an erroneous impression of the fact, wil you allow me to state that I retired from that office simply because, havng held it for 20 years, I considered that the time was come when I might with propriety ask to be relieved from its duties 7 The directors met mny request in the most friendly manner, and placed on the minutes of the Court a handsome recognition of my services, together with such a pecuniary vote as is usual in such cases after such a term ot service. "I was in perfect health at the time. It is true that I have since had an attack of indisposition, now nearly passed away, but it bad nothing to do with my retirement from the office in que8tion. " I am, Sir, your obedient servant, "J. D. POWIES."
THB CORAV TRADE. MARK-LANE, MONDAY AOILO . JULY 6. With a good arrival of oats last week, the other supplio were moderate. The exports wero 9S8 quarters wheat, 500 quarters oats, and 38 sacks flour. Of wheat there were received 5,102 quarters English, and 10,075 quarters foreign. The morning's show from Xent and Essex was very scanty; but business was on a still more limited scale, last week's prices being held for, and millers unwilling to buy unless at 2s. per quarter abatement. In foreign some slight concession was necoessary to make sale. The receipts of country flour were 14,141 sacks, with 2,250 barrels 1,931 sacks from abroad. Norfolks were down to 46s. per sack, and American and other samples a very slow sale at former prices. Of English barley there were only 33 quarters, of foreign 8,512 quarters. The usual retail demand of the season was experienced, but buyers had to pay fully the previous terms. In malt business was steady at former prices. Of English oats there were 278 quarters, of Scoteh 5S quarters, of Irish 1,900 quarters, with 27,781 quarter foreign, mostly undried, Many samples being out of condition, such were difficult to place without some reduction, but aU sweet corn was firm. The quantity of beaus and peas was unusually small, and entirely native; of the former there were 149 quarters, of the latter only seven quarters. Both these descriptions of corn were quite as dear. The arrivals of linseed were 1,870 quarters, with 300 quarters exported. The upward tendency of prices stil ruled in consequeneo of the limited supplies. cakes also brought fully as much money. In the seed trade scarcely anything was passing, and in the absence of business quotations were unaltered. Arrivals of Com In the Pert of London, from June 29 to Julv 4.

PARLIA-MENTARY INTELLIGENCE. ThIUSE OF LORDS, MOxDAY, JUY 6. The Lorn CA Cim0m took his seat upoD the woolsaLk at 5 o'clock. Earl HOWE presented a petition from the patron, pre. sident, and managers of Hinckley Savings-banak against the law to amend savings-banks; also from the inhabitants of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, in the county of Leicester, against the Alteration of Oaths Bill. ST. JAMES'S PARK. The Earl of MAf AL MESBURY said that abont six weeks ago his noble friend opposite promised, at his request, to furnish a return of the correspondence between the Treasury and the Board of Works respecting the clterations in the Park. He had applied a second time for these documents, but owing to some mistake they had not yet been pi oduced. Considering that the correspondence had been presented to the House of Commons, it would perhaps be better that he should regularly move that it be also laid on their lordships' table. a r lhe noble earl moved for the papers accordingly. The motion was agreed to. THE SCHOONER MARIA. The Earl of MIALMESBURY wished to put a question to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs relative to a case of some hardship. It was the case of a Captain Ouseley. comnmander and part-owner of the schooner Maria, which had been seized by the Venezuelan Government. It appeared that a boat had been detached from the schooner in order to procure provisions at Caraccas. Onxboard the bolt there were some few yards of cloth which the crew intended merely to barter for the proviions of which they stood in need. They were, however, accused of smuggling, and the boat was consequently seized. The captain was broug'st before the tribunal of the country, and fined 100 dollars for a breach of the Custom-house rules of Venezuela. Not satisfied with this, the Government of that country also seized the schooner, which was then engaged in a regular and legitimate trade-that of carrying cattle to Demerara. The seizure occurred on the 7th of Mrch, 1856. Since then a correspondence had taken place between his noble friend (Lord Clarendon) and the brother-in-law of Captain Ouseley; and it appeared that no notice whatever had been taken of this transaction by our Charg6 d'Affaires at Caraccas, and thatno communication onthesubjecthadbaen sent by that, officer to the Foreign-office in answer to in. quiries that bad been addressed to him regarding it. In the meantime, Captain Ouseley had presented a bill against the authorities of Venezuela for damages to the amount cf something like 3,0001. He wished his noble friend to explain, if he could, how such a proceeding as this, affecting a vessel that was British-built, British-manned, and Britishowned, should have taken place without the knowledge of the Foreign-office being drawn to it by our Charg& d'Affaires. The Earl of CLARENDON (who was very indistinctly heard) was sorry that he could not afford his noble friend the explanation he desired. It was perfectly true that neither before nor since the information relative to this case had been given to the Foreign-office by the parties interested had he received any report on the subject from our Charge d'Affaires at Caraccas. As soon as the circumstances came to his knowledge he put himself in communication with the Comnmioner of Venezuela, who was then about to return to that country, and requested him to be good enough to lay the matter under the notice of the Venezuelean Government. Since then, however, he had not heard anything of that gentleman's proceedlngs. Although he had not yet succeeded in obtaining any information respecting this transaction, he trusted that before much longer he should receive some explanation on the subject. CONVEYANCE OF TROOPS TO INDIA. The Earl of CARDIGAN wished to ask whether it was true that the reinforcements of European infantry and cavalry about to be despatehed to India for the purpose of suppressing the serious insurrection which had broken out in that country were to be sent out in sailing vessels, instead of in steamers. After what had happened during the war in the Crimea, the Government would be profiting little by past experience if, when they nad so many war and merchant steamers at their command, they sent out these troops, whose speedy presence was required to meet a critical emergency, by sailing veseels. Lord PANMURE. -In reply to the noble earl I can only inform your lordships that Her MIajesty's Government gave great consideration to the means by which these troops should be conveyed with the utmost expedition to India. We were assured that from the difficulty in procoring steamvessels of the requisite description, and tl o delay caused by the number of the intermediate points , t whichlthey are obliged to touch, sailing vessels would rea h their destination as soon, if not sooner, than steamers. The Earl of ELLENBOR>OUJGH said that steamers must le greatly improved now, but when he was in India the best passages were those made by sailng vessels. The Present season wlas very favourable for making the passage by sail- ALLEGED REVIVAL OF THE SLAVE TRADE. Lord BROUGHIAM said, he found he had exaggerated the number of free negroes about to be conveyed to the French colonies from the coast of Africa. He understood that the number was not 20,000, as he had stated, but 10,000. He was sure that no scheme for the revival of the slave trade would obtain the assent of the Emperor of the French, and he also felt confident that no one would regard such a scheme with more suspicion than his noble friend (Lord Clarendon). It must be admitted that there was the greatest difference between carrying off free negroes, or whateverthey might be caled, to a slave colony, and carrying them to colonies in which slavery was abolished. Yet, as regarded the Africans, even although they might be carried to colonies in which slavery was abolished, yet any scheme of this kind ought to be viewed with distrust, and to be most carefully and scrapulously watched. The Earl of SHAFTESBTJRY said, that some misuader. standing existed with regard to a deputation that recently waited upon the First Lord of the Treasury on this subject. The main object of that deputation was to represent some facts eonnected with the increase of the slave trade and the necessity of repressing it, not so much on the cost of Africa as by means of additional gunboats and steamers on the shores of Cuba. The want of free labour in some of the colonieswascertainly a matter of diseussion among that deputation, and one gentleman gave an opinion oa that subject. But as far as he (the Earl of Sbaftesbury) and others were concerned, their opinion was, that to endeavour to set on foot a seheme for Carrying free negroes from the coast of Africa would be to all intents and purposes a revival of the slave trade, the most accused crime that ever was perpetrated. - The Earl of MALMESBiURY thought that if it could be clearly shown that the conveyance of free negroes to free colonies would lead to a revival of the slave trade there would he an end of the matter. On the score both of philanthropy and commerce it was, however, worthy of consideration, when miUions of acres elsewhere were lying uncultivated for want of negro labour, whether the negros, were to be always confined to the shores of Africa. He trusted that their lordships and the Goverment would not tae it for gNranted that any efforts or ex:periments in the diroetion which the French Government were now taking Smust inevitably result in the revival of the horrors of thge slave trade. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ofth The Earl of CLARENDON had made inquiry into the matter in consequence of the speech delivered by his noble and learned friend, and he found that the condition of the assent of the French Government to the contract was that ir should be an engagement of free labourers, and that the negroes should be sent to those colonies where labour was wanted. It was intended to take aU possible se3uritles ag-ainst abuses, but he agreed with his noble and learned friend that no plan of this sort could be safely carried out without a liabityto the revival of the slave trade. (Hear.) INDIAN ADMINISTRATION. The Mlarquis of CLANRICARDE, in rising to move for returns relative to the civil service in India, said, that as he believed there was no objection to their production, and as there must before long be a general inquiry into the administration of the Indian Government, he would not detain their lordshipsat any length. When the present disturbances were put down-and hehad no doubt they would be quelled at much less cost and withmuchlessdiffleultythansomepersons supposed-Parliament must inquire into the causes of the state of things which recent events had proved to exist in the lidian army. To suppose that this was a mere uestion of greased cartridges was absurd. The returns which he desired would be of great service in the prosecution of these investigations, and would show what was the amount of administrative force at the disposal of the Indian Government. At present he spoke upon imperfect information, but it appeared to him that they were expecting the present Governor-General to administer the affairs of fndia with the same number of civil servants that were at the disposal of the Indian Government in 1846, when our territory was much smaller in extent. To show their lordships that he had not adopted that opinion without due authority he should quote a passa3e from the minute of Lord Dalhousie, which had been laid upon the table of their lordships' House in the course of the last year. He learned from the 12th paragraph of that minute that "in eight years four Indian kngdoms had passed under the seoptre of Her Majesty, and that various chieftansbips and smaUer districts had ~been brought under er sway. Among the smaller acquisitions the Governor- G.eneral enumerated Khyrpore, Ungool, Sikldm, some Nepaulese Sirdars, Mundote, the Nawab Nazim of Bengal, and the States of Central India. Then there were, besides those, the Punjab, Rangoon, Nagpore, Sattara, Hyderabad, and Oude; the population thus brought under the dominion of this country amounting to nearly 11,000,000 of souls, while the extent of territory thus acquired amounted to 207,637 square miles. It also appeared,fromareturn which had been laid upon the table of their lordships' House that the amount of revenue derived from those recent additions to our territory in India was 4,330,000. per annum. Notwithstanding that large in. crease, however, in the extent of our territory he could not ascertain that any corresponding addition had been made to our civil service in India. The number of the covenanted civil servants in that countryhad been, he found, in 1846, 431, while in 1856 it was not more than 432. It was quite clear, therefore, that we were imposing upon the Governor-General of India the task of ruling an empire of considerably enlarged proportions with precisely the same staff as had been appointed in 1846 to admitister the affairs of a much smaller territory. How long, he would ask, were we to continue that policy ? Was India the only one of our possessions which was to be deprived of that elastic charaeter by which the number of the public servants was adapted to the requirements of the State? What was the resource which, under thoso circumstances, was open to the Governor-General when a demand for an increase in the number of the civil servants arose? Why, in the case in which an office of high importance was to be filled he was debarred froma calling to his aid any member of the uncovenanted civil service. What was the consequence ? He was obliged to resort to the military department, and to take ,officers away from the duties of their profession to fil civil eLployments. Thus, when an increase in the number of civ. £{ervants in India became nimperative a diminution of th9 ,i'vt ilorq waB the inmrlpblQ nwt. ug had WMad it stated that the number of officers who were under those circumstances taken away from their regiments amounted to no less than 25 per cent. That such a state of things existed he attribated to the fault of no individuaL He deemed it to be the result of the system, and he trusted the Government would, by agreeing to the production of the returns for which horose to move, place their lordships and the COnntrYi aposition toobtain accurate information uponasubject so important to the efficient administration of the affairs of our Inian empire. The noble lord concluded by moving for the following :-Return of the number of officers belonging to and employed in the civil Eervice of the East India Company, discinguishing thoee in the covenanted from those in the uncovenanted service, and in receipt of not less than 400b a-year salary, on the 1st of January, 1846, and a similar return for the 1st of January, 1856 ; and, also, return of the number of military officers employed in diplomatic, poltical, or other civil services, on the 1st of January, 1846, and a similar retarn for the 1st of January, 1856. The Earl of ALBEHARLE rose to express a hope that a ful and searching inquiry into the condition of India in all its branches would be instituted. If such an inquiry took place it would, he thought, be found necessary to make very material changes in the policy which had hitherto been adopeedtowards that country, and especially in one portion of that policy he alluded to that by which the annexation of the territories of princes whose dominions bordered upon our own was brought about. In the adoption of that system, indeed, might be found one of the causes which had led to the mutinies which had lately taken place. In suppor' of that reform he might state that about 15 months since he had had a long conversation with an intelligent Mahommedan native of India in reference to the annesation of Oude, and the gentleman in questionhad upon that occasion observed to hit, "If you annex Oude you will find that disaffection will break out among the native troops, and for this reason,-they are all drawn from the agriclntural, but not from the peasant class. They are what you would call in this country yeomen, or small landlords. They are of the highest caste, being either Rajpoots or Brahmins, and are of a most inflammable character. They number about 50,000, and will necessarily be deprived of many of their privileges by the annexation of their territory." Such was tho opinion of the gentlemn3 to whom he had referred, and he might add that it had also been pointed out to him that the new land revenue system which the Government had introduced into the northwestern provinces of India, and which was made to follow the annexation of this new territory, was iegarded by the natives as a great hardship, inasmuch as under its operation every man's property was surveyed, and each of those 50,000 sepoys would thus be compelled to make out his thtle to the land in his possession. He understood that Her Majesty's Ministers mightrelyupon the fact that 140 petitions had already emanated from the sepoys of Oude in reference to that subject, and he therefore trusted that the Government would institute the most minute inquiries into the system to which he had adverted. He had only that morning received a newspaper from India, called tho sing Sun. dated May 20, which contained a quotation from another journal, complaining of the irritating nature of the survey of the lands m that country. The Duke of ARGYLL having intimated his assent upon the part of the Government to the productioa of the returns, The motion was agreed to. RIGHTS OF THE CROWN BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW WATER MARK. The Earl of DERBY, in rising to present petitions complaiing of the enforcement of those rights, said he felt he could not do faU justice to the subject'to which they related, inasmuch as it involved legal questions of a very serious and complicated nature. If their lordships,however, would permit him to enter somewhat into detail, he trusted he shoald be able to show them that the subject-matter of the petitions was one which was well worthy of consideration. It involved the right of the Crown to the land between high and low watertthroughout the whole of the united kingdmn, and not only to the extent of that right, bat to the manner in which of late years it had been sought to enforce it. The two petitions which he was about to present were from different parties, and in some respects were diffelent in detail; but,as the subject-matter was the same, he thought that it would be most convenient if he were to state the subject of them at the same time. The first petition was from a Mr. Lewis, a gentleman of considerable property upon the coast of Carmarthenshire, and who once represented that county in Parliament, and the other was from the Llanelly Railway and Dock Company, which had been established in 1838. It would be necessary, perhaps, for him to state to their lordships a few particulars connected with the locality to which these petitions referred. There was an inlet in the coast, ranning nearly north and south, which at low water exhibited a vast expanse of sand, the banks of which were occazeonally flooded at high tide, and presented the character of salt marshes. About two-thirds of the way up the inlet lay the town of Llanelly, and upon the left side was the estate of Mr. Lewis, who possessed a considerable part of the frontage of the coast. Up to the year 1845 llr. Lewis and his predecessors had enjoyed undisputed possession of the property, andhad exercised al the rights of ownership; and, in fact, a seam of coal having been discovered, a shaft had been sunk, in order to work it. So long ago as 1807 and 1812, in enclosure Acts passed in those years, the property of Mr. Lewis was recognized and exempted from the operation of those Acts. Under these circumstances Mr. Lewis, in the year 1845, found that an information had been filed aainst him which recited that the soil of all navigable rivers so far as the tide d owed belonged to the Crown, and which proceeded to claim for the Crown partt of his land which had been reached by the highest hdes, and which included the shaft to which he had referred. Mr. Lewis had lost no time in filing an answer to that information, and he availed himself of the valuable assistance of Sir R. BethelL In 1851 the Master of the Rolls thought that the Crown should proceed against other parties, first by a trial at bar. The Earl of Cawdor, who cliamed manorial rights, compromised the matter with the Crown, and he couldnotbut express regret that that compromisehadbeenmade,because,haditnottaken place, thesubsequentproceedings would never have beentaken. In those proceedings Sir R. BetheD, who had been Solicitor-General, was called upon to argue the case for the Crown, so that Mr. Lewis had the disadvantage of having opposed to him an advocate who, from having been originally retained upon his side, was well acquainted with all the facts of the case. There was another disadvantage against which Mr. Lewis had to contend. In the year 1847 an Act was passed which authorized the construction of the South Wales Railway, and in the course of that work an embankment was made which much improved the character of the salt marshes. The Lord Chancellor had ultimately decided that the line of boundary between the property of the Crown and that of the subject was the medium line between high water and low water of all kinds occurring in the ordinary course of nature during the year. Mr. Lewis in his petition went on to state that Mr. Rendel, a civil engineer, had been appolnted to lay down such medium line, bu' that he having died without having determined the boundary, and no person having as yet been appointed to perform that ditty, the whole matter had to be gone into afresh, and, the suit being registered as lis pendens, Mfr. Lewis was debarred from the free exercise and control of his own property. Now, it appeared to him that that judgment did not by any means satisfactorily conclude the question. If the doctrine of themediumlineweretobe maintained, and the Crown were to have the absolute disposal of all that lay between the proprietor and low water mark, it might interpose another person between him and the sea; and thus, if the marks were permanent, do him, andif they were movable, do the subsequentgranteea greatinjury. Thisbeing the case, the etitioner complained that while the question was still unaer adjudication notices were served upon somo tenants of his three or four miles up the inlet, stating that slag and refuse had been deposited on the foreshore belonging to the Crown, and asking whether they were willing to take from the Crown a lease of this foreshore. This baing in the same locality, and, indeed, in the same parish, might have been included in the original information, and the right to all tried at the same time. What Mr. Lewis complained of was that his rights had been violated, that having no interest in the adjudication he was compolled to fight it on the part of the public, and that there was no probability of the termination of the litigation. The case of the Llanelly Railway and Dock Company was still stronger. lUnder the authority of an Act of Parliament passed in the year 1828, they took land, with the prescribed forms, expended money, formed a dock, and carried out the railway to a junction with it. Having done this they received notice from the Woods and Forests, stating that they had taken land which was the property of the Crown, being between high and low water mark, and that they must take a lease of it from the Crown. To this notice a reply was sent, stating that it had caused the directors much surprise, and that there was no groand for the claims made in it. Some time afterwards they received another letter from the Woods and Forests, stating that Mr. Rendel was engagel in making a map in the ease of Mr. Lewis ; and as soon as it was finished they would again be communicated with. Here, then, was the Woods and Forest Department at firat setting up a map and telling the company that if they d;d not compromise the matterthey would be proceeded against: and then, as soon as it appeared that these proceedings would beresisted, fallig back upou the assertion that the map they had proposed could not be made the basis of an arbi tration, but that when another plan whieh was preparing was completed they should renew their demand against the company. If a prescription of 60 years were to be required there was no harbour or dock which had been made upon the foreshore within the last 60 years against which this claim, which he believed to be perfectly novel to the law of England, might not be urged. o one disputed that within certain limits the Crownhad dominion over the soil between high and low water mark, but he thought it was a question whether that was a right to sell or to make it a means of profit by alienation by way of lease, or whether it was not merely a power with which the Crown was invested for the protection of the public property and of the public convenience. A great authority, who wrote in the time of Queen Elizabeth (Callis), said-" Rex habet proprietatem, sed populus habet usum ibidem necessarium." Mr. Justice Bailey laid down that,- "1Paim4 facie the lord of the manor is entitled up to high water mark, but between high water and low water mark, tho ordinary high and low water mark, the right is prirm4 facie in the Crown. The right of the Crown is not in general for any beneficial interest to the Crown itself, bus for securing to the public certain privileges in the spot between high and low water mark; and if any nuisance is comnittAd on that spot, then the Crownihas the power of proceeding to rectify such nuisance." Woolrycb, commenting on this, said " If the King were to make the seashores of the realm a Eource of private sale and profit, he would, according to what is said before by the judges, be acting contrary to the trasts for which the ownership of the shore was vested in the Crown by the common law."1 The ownership of the soil between high and low water mark was vested in the Crown by the common law for the pro tection of the public, and not for the sake of any profit or advantageto the Crown; but this wasexactlywhat the Crcwn was doing in this case. There were two cases to which he wished to call their lordshids' attention as illastrating the restrictions which the law Imposed upon the exercise of this power by the Vrown, In the we of "The Attorney-Gene- ral v. Burridge," it was laid down " that the Crown could grant by letters patent all the land between high and low water mark, but subject to tho public right of passage, and that the restriction of such right was a nuisance, and a matter of fact to be inquired into." In the second case buildings had been erected by tho corporation of Portsmouth, wbich were ordered to be abated by a decree, inasmuch as they intercepted the flux and reflux of the tide, and it was held to be no defence that the buildings were placed there by grant of the Crown by charter to the corporation. No general order could be allowed to prevail against the public rights. Therefore, according to the law, the Crown was entitled to certain rigbts on this portion of the soil, but only for useful public purposes, and for the prevention of encroachments i but, beyond that, the Crown had no rights. Two very important questions were raised by this petition; one as to the rights of the Crown, aud the other the manner in which they had been exercised. If it were once admitted that the 3manner in which the claims of the Crown had been carried out were correct, not a single dock or harbour in the kingdomv was safe; and an Act of Parliament was no security if less than 60 years old, because if it could be eaid that it infringed on thb right3 of the Crown it mRust be set aside as vaste paper. These points were well 2eserving of the attention of the Government.. The petitioners prayed that their lordships would appoint a select committee to inquire into the rights of the Crown and the manner in which they were exercised; but, though he was not now prepared to press this upon their lordships, he hoped that some steps would be ta.en to quiet the apprehensions which prevailed throughout the country on these points. Perhaps no better course could be taken than to pass an Act declaring what the rights of the Crown were between high and low water 3mark. The noble lord concluded by maoving that the petition be laid on the table. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY said that it was now some time since the attention of theCrown was drawn tothe fact tbat encroachments had taken place on tke coast of Carmarthen, on that portion of the soil comprised between high and low water mark. In 1845, by direction of Sir W. Follett, then Attorney-General, an information were filed against the parties, and a verdict was then obtained by the Crown against Lord Cawdor. With regard to the case of Mr. Lewis, it was agreed in the year 1855 that it should be referred to Mr. Bendel, as arbitrator, to decide what should be tho definition of "high and low water mark," and to draw the high water line, according to the principle laid down in the judgment of the Lord Chancellor, Baron Alderson, and Mr. Justice Maule, calcnlated on an average of the highest and lowest tides. When Mr. Rendel died, Mr. Bidder, at Mr. Lewis's express desire, was appointed arbitrator in his place. So far as Mr. Lewis's case was concerned, therefore, there did not exist the slightest cause of complaint. With regard to Llanelly Docks, surely it was the duty of the body constructing those docks to ascertain before doing so that their title to the ground was a good one. The noble earl said the Crown had no right to the property on the foreshore; bat how would the noble earl like if his right to that part of the shore on which the port of Liverpool stood were to be so dealt with? (Hear.) The right of the noble earl to that shore was a grant from the Crown, and of course the Crown could give to the noble earl, or to his ancestors, no power that it did not possess itself. If it was decided that the Crown had no beneficial interest in this foreshore, then perhaps the noble earl would see it his duty to give up the not inconsiderable sum which he received on account of the docks at LiverpooL (Laughter.) The legal question he world leave to those whs were more qualified than himself tospeak to that point, and he had no doubt they woald make it appear that no new or undue pretensions had ibeen put forward on behalf of the Crown by the Government. Lord WYNFORD had last session warned their lordships ofEthe growing claims put forward on behalf of the Crown,| when a case was before them affecting a portion of the coast of Scotland. He knew that a great number of proprietors, not only on the seacoast, but on the banks of navigAble rivers, complained that their properties wera so tied up for years, that they could not use them with advantage, simply because the Woods and Forests had made vexatious claims on the part of the Crown. With regard to the case of MIr. Lewis he was surprised to hear the noble lord opposite say that that gentleman hsd consented to submit the case to another arbiter, as he had never heard that he had consented to any such thing. Mr. Rendel died while the case was under his consideration, and no person had yet been appointed to perform his duties. The LORD CEIANCELLOR understood the noble earl to go upon the assumption that the Crown had a right to this disputed shore, but, nevertheless, to question the propriety of asserting that right. Bet if it was a right which the Crown held not for its own advantage, but for the advantage of the publc, surely it would be sacrificing the public interests to those of the neighbouring proprietors if it did not enforce it. He remembered that many years ago the legal question was submitted to him and to his noble friend near him, then Attorney-General (Lord Campbell), as to what the rights of the Crown were, and they gave what, of course, they considered sound and correct advice. That opinion was acted upon by the Government of Sir R. Peel, with the concurrence of Sir W. FoUett; but from some cause the trial of the question was delayed for several years, when it was found that the Crown was entitled to the l:.uus marws. The subject came before him (Lord ChancelUor) subsequently upon appeaL when he had the able assistance of Mr. Justice MIaule and the late Baron Alderson. The concludion they came to was, that the right of the Crown was clear, and that a line should be drawn between the highest and lowest marks of spring-tides to indicate the boundary. The question was subsequently raised upon petition before him who shonld defiue that line, and with the consent of all parties Mr. lPendel was appointed. The delay that had occurred was hr. Lewis's own fault in not rging llr. Rendel to complete his task. When that gentleman died Mr. Bidder WaS, in February last, appointed his successor, and Mr. Lewis had just as much power as the Crown to urge on the settlement of the question. The Duke of BUCCLEUCE thought that in proceeding; instituted bythe Woods andForeststheyshould be compelled to proceed with expedition, instead of, as at present, leaving parties with all the anxieties and uncertainties of longpending disputes. Lord CAMPBELL protested against any legislation upon a matter which was as clear as any matter could be. There was no doubt whatever of the right of the Crown to the soil lying between high and low water marks. Lord BROUG 1AM said there was no doubt of the law, but in some cases there was a vigorous, and in others a capricions exercise of those rights, which was veryobjectionable. Lord WENSLEYDALE took the same view of the law, as his noble and learned friends, and was of opinion that there could be no doubt of the right of the Crown to the soi between high and low water marks for the benefit of the public. The subject then dropped. The Dulwich CoUege Bil, the Militia (Ireland) Act. 18S5. Amendment Bill, and the Oxford University Bill wera severally read a third time and passed. Their Lordships adjourned at five minutes past 7 lock.

Mr. H. BERKELEY as'kedl the Secretary to the Treasury, In reference to the statement of the Fir-st Lord of theAdmiralty that the steamer Oneida had been condemned by the Government Surveyor, under what circumstances t-he said vessel was employed in the conveyance of Her MZajestys mails from this country and Australia, notwvithstanding such report - and whether it was a fact that he bad offered to the Royval West India Mail Company to extend for twa years beyod th tim nowpresribe thesubsidy of 270,0001., Mr. WILSON stated that the Oneida was not employecl for the purpose of conveoyig the regular mail to Australia. It no doubt carried a mail, buxt that maLil was an ordinarytransit one, which any other vessel miplit have~ carried,. The circumstances to which his hon. friend alluied were these :-The Oneida was one of the vessels offered by thaAustralian Coinpany for the purpose of performing their contract. According to the rule of the Goverinnent she was, surveyed atb Southampton before she left this country. That survey took place on the 18th of October in last year, and the Oneida sailed on the 19th. On the 20th, the day afterwards, the surveyor reported to the Admiralty, and onL the 21st thie Admiralty made a report to the Treasury ; but of course it was then impossible to prevent the depaAu-re of the steamer. An intimation was, howev-er, imnmedliatelymade to the company that the Oneidla would not he acoepted2~ under their contract for the performance of the services Before she returned, as vwas known, the Oneida broke downbat, he repeated, she had not been accepted by the Goverm mont, 'With reference to theother portion of thequestion, it had been already suggested to him that an arrankgement, such as thait stated by his hon. frienid, might be carried out-; but the Government had come to no conclusionx upon th'o. maatter, nor had a formal proposition been made on the subject. When suchL a proposal -was submitted, it would, of course, bo consideredwith a due regard to the interest of the pbi. THE KRUGER COLLECTION. Mhr.

It took place immediately after a report from a committee of the House, which prxctically put an end to the old constitution of the Board of Trustees and before the new constitution was established. The purchase had not been made with the advice or even with the ognizance of the trustees, bat under the immediate advic, hebelheved, of Mr. Dce. Sir C. Eastlake saw oneof the pictures which was sent home, but he was in no way responsible for the purchase either of that pictare or of the collection; neither were the trustees of the National GUANO. Mr. BA-XTER asked the First Lord of the Admiralty why no vessel of war proceeded to Bird Island,in the Pacific, before Decoember, 185G, although, as it appeared fromt the rinted pers, Mr. Miller, Her Majesty's Consul at, oahoo,ad made known to the commanders of alt Heu Majesty's ships that touched at that port since August. 1854, and also to the Commauder-in-Chief of Her Majesty'E naval forces in the Pacific, the purport of Ar. Hammond's circular despateh of May, 1854, directing dilieent search tco be made for deposits of guano; and w'hether Bird Island had since been taken possession of by the Urnitedt Sir C.

Mr. DI RA LI moved an address to the Crown for rseturnsofhennuavaueoalreaprpery BcheuleA oftheIncoe-tx fo th yerendth5h appointmentts muqt be made preparatory to the neoourt ensering upon its duties; but the judge of the new court ina reality might not bo in existence at the time. The old.oart must continue to discharge its fenctione until tho' verr moment before the now court came into operation, and ths ptesent judge migbt possibly decline to accept the office of jludge of the niew court, so that at the time when it was absolately necessary that these arrangements should be made the functionary by whom alone they conld be made' according to the clause might not be in existence. He Fioposed, therefore, in the place of "the judge of the toart.' to insert the words "the Lord Chancellor" Wr. HENLEY said it was or great importance to the working of the ue%fi system that the judge should have ths fullest confidezce in ail the fhnctionaries under him, and be hoped the amendtne&t would be well considered before it was finally adopted. Mr. ROLT thought the Lcwl Chancellor, to whom, of course, every one would ivo credit for dcsiring to make the best appointments, coul?not poeeibly haTe the eamemeano of judging as to the fitne.rof the persons to be appointod as the judge of the court. The ATTOlRNEY-GEN1MAL sid that the Lord Chan. cellor would mnuch prefer that the judge should have the appointment of these officers, but it was utterly impoeible, as he had already explained, lo to arrange the machbiery of the Bi. All these appointments must be made-before the new judge tolok office, but he could asure the committee that the Lord Chancellor, as soss as tho!aewvjudge had beesn selected, would in every respect tee the epinion and oonsult the wishes of that genitleman, viwoever hlo might, be. The amendment was agreed to, and the clause as amended ordered to stand part of the Bill, a was also clause 14. On clause 15, which provides for appointment to office& and for fees, Mr. MAMINS moved As an amendment the omission of words, with the view of inserting others to provide that the remuneration given to registrars and other officer3> should be by salary, instead of fees. The ATTORNEY-GEN'BERA obiected to the amendment, which would have the effect of giving to a-registrar who had a great deal to do the same remunerntion as one who had much less to do. He was desirous of securing the, close personal attention of the officers to their duties, and. the way to secure that was to pay them by fees proportioned to the duties they perforesd. Mtr. ROEBUCK thought that where a service was imposed upon a man for the benefit of the- State the State, should pay him, and not the person who required the ser- rMr. MAITNS said the COunty Court judges were at first paid by fees, but this was found to be so objectionable that recourse was had to salaries. If they were to act oin the principle that every man should he paid for what he did by fees they would be led back to the system *of paying the Lord Chancellor and other high functionaries in that. way. Mr. HELELY was favourable to tho principle of paying, by salary, but in the present case he tbought the Govern. ment had como to a wise conclusion, for it would be impossible at once to adopt the system under this Bill. After a year or twAo1 wAhen they had experience of the working of the measure, they might adopt the wiser principle of paying by salary; but he thougAht that at present it would be too grest a disturbance of the existing practice. Mr. ROEBTJCK asked on what principle the fces were ta be regulated. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said, in the first place, theprice of the stamp would ba regulated-by theamount of'the estate, a less stamp beingrequired for asmallthanforalarge estate. In the next place, the copy of the probate would be paid for according to its length. A small estate generally required but a short enumeration of items, whereas in a. large estate there was ordinarily a multiplication of trusts,. &c., so that the fees would be regulated according to the amount of the property. M1r. BRISCOE could not see why the public should be caUed upon to pay for the registration of wills, and therefore hoped the amendment would not be pressed. The amendment was then negatived, and the clause as arcended was agreed to. Clauses 16 to 23 were agreed to. Upon clause 24, Mr. WESTEElA AD asked whether it was intended that the registrars to be appointed shouldhave the power to take affidavits in respect to wiUs. The ATTORNKY-G&NERAL could not undertake to say thatit might not become requisite in makiug therulesand orders for the practice of the Court of Probate in some way to alter the duties now performed by surrogates ; but it would be the desire of those who framned those rules and orders to give those gentlemen as full a measurs of remunerative employment as they now enjoyed. Mfr. BARROW inquired whether commissioners or registrars would have power to swear executors without the necessiry of issuing special commissions. The ATTORNEY-GENBRAL said one of the objects of the clause was to prevent the necessity of those special commi5ions which were now directed by the Prerogative Court at considerable expense to the parties. Mr. STEEL moved, as an amuendment, after "probate," to insert "provided that in every city, borough, and townl throughout England containing not less than 5,000 inhabitants the judge shall appoint the registrar of the County Court of the district in which such city, borough, or town is situate, or some other fit and roper person within such. city, borough, or town, to be such commnissioner or commissioners." I'u tho district with which he was connected, which was in the diocese of Carlisle, no surrogates had beezi appointed. Lord HOTEAM saidthere wasa greatdifference between the daties performed by surrogates in the province of York and those of the surrogates in the province of Canterbury. The duties of the former were nearly the same as those of the proctors of Canterbury, and consequently their emolunments were mnch-larger than the other surrogates. Woald that difference be taken into consideration ma framing the rules and orders? The ATTORNEY-G ENERAL admitted the distinction pointed out by the noble lord, but could not ventu,re to say that under the general rules and orders the exceptional case of the surrogates of York would be treated in such a way as to leave the remuneration of those gentlemen as large as at present. The peculiar position of those gentlemen might be dealt with by a special clause, which could be brought forward at a subsequent period. With regard to the amendment of the hon. and learned member for Carlisle he (the Attorney-General) thought it unnecessary, as in the clause now under discussion power was given to the judga to appoint as surrogates such persons as he might think fit. The amendment was then withdrawn and the claus agreed to, as also was clause 25.n On clause 26, regulating the procedure of the court, The ATTORNBY-GE RALR proposed several verbal. amendmnents. His great desire was to conveyto the comnittee the assurance that everycare would be taken to render the practice of the court as espeditious, as simple, and as economical as possible. But it had been deemeda essential-not to abrogate in lo-o the whole of the existing praotice, because you could never be certain that your new rules and orders would provide for every case that might possibly arise. His amendments would therefore meet this contingency. ar. BOWYEB proposed the insertion of the words, " In all matters which do not lie within the jurisdiction of the PRrerogative Court." The ATTORNBY-GENBRA&L said he was utterly unhble to understand the meaning of the hon. and learned gentleman's amendment. (Laughter.) Mr. BOWYER.-I shaU not trouble the committee by dividing, but I will just state what the effect of my amend-. ment would be. (Laughter, a-nd cries of " No.") Mr. BowYLEns amendment having been negatived, the amendments proposed by the ATro EY-GILNEIB L were ngreed to, and the clause was ordered to stand part of tho Bill. Clause 27 was struck out. Clauses 28 to 3L inclusive were areed to. Clauses 32 and 33 were postponed. On clause 34, which gave a power of appeal to the Houso - of Lords, 3Mr. IIIALINS proposed to insert " Judicial Committee of the Privy Council" ia. the place of " House of Lords." The former court had always given the greatest satisfaction to the public, while the Hlouse of Lords au a court of appeal was most expensive and dilatory, and a very decided opinion was pronounced against it bythe Rouze of CommDns. last year. The ATTOR2NMY-GENERAL fully appreciated the great value of the Iudicial Committee of the Privy CounciL as a court of appeal; but there was a reason w hy it should. -not be had recourse to in the present instace. If the Bill became law it mig^ht happen that questions might arise ia the common law courts eiher the sarne or of a cognate charactoz with qnestions vhich arose behro thu Court of Probate. Then, the questions arising n the common law courts would be carried to the House of Lords, while those, in the Court of Probate would, if the amendment were agreed to, be c-arried to the Judicial Committee of the Privy CounciL This would lead to cansiderable inconvenience, and he trusted therefore that the committee wonld adhere to the Bill us it stood. le waa.sure that any change. inthis respectwouldnot beoacceded to in another place. aDd ho deprecated any alteration v h: h w;ould lead to anything like acollision between the t.vo Houses o;EParliament, anld which mighh. thereby endanger to succss of the Bitt. Mr. CAIRNS hoped that his hcln. and learned friend the member for Wallingford wduld taes the opinion ci the conmittee ulpon this auend'nent. lin thought that it was a9 -matter of grest regret that we hbd two couris of appeal in *the last)vsort la tiis country; * out, seeing that there were two such courts, sarely they souldl select the best. The House of Lords had never ye3 had anything to do with appeals upon probate jurisdiction. Thoa udicial Committee had performiied its work to thesatisEiaction oi everybody, and. he cbjected to the j-trisdiction being taken irom it without, fome reason atsigued. He *lid not see why any objection, should be taken in another place to the propwsed amend. ment because the Bill had been introduced into the Hoass of L<rds by the Lord Cha=cellor with the apperl running to the Privy CounciL FortUied, then, by the opinion of the Lord Chancellor, and by an experience of the advantage ot al peals to the l?rivy Coancil, he should support the anenad. mtnt. The SOLICITOR-OENERAL said that no doabt the apt eat at present lay from the Ecclesiastical Coart to the Judicial Comiittee, but at present the Ecclesiastie,l Court dealt only with personalty, and it dealt with it in a peculiBa manner, the proteere being analogous with the procedure of the Judicial Committee of the Privy CounciL By thc Bill, however, that form of procedure would be abolished, and the Court sE Probata would now bo einpowered to try issues of fack before a jury. Al then incidents attendant tpon the trl o issues on tatters of fact in a common law outrt woulZ arise in the Court of Probate, aad in that state of things. It must be apparent that the House of Lords would ve ant advattage over the Judicial Committee of the Privy Counctl as a Cou-;c of Atppeal, because they couldi surs~mon thg eouuontso IOs' judges to thiwi sit-ssvnco whit

LG2DON, TUBSDAY, JULY 7, 187. In the House of Lords last night The Earl of CXRDIGo" asked whether it were true that the reinforcements for India were about to be despatched in sailing vessels. Lord PA RsN replied that, after mature deliberation, the Government had come to the determination to employ sailing vessels rather than steamers. Lord CLARENDON, in reply to Lord BROUGHAM, stated that the French Government meant to take all possible securities against abuses in the plan of negrol emigration which had been proposed; at the same time he, Lord CLARENDON, agreed with Lord BROUGBAM that any such plan mist have a tendency to revive the slave trade. Certain returns connected with the Indian Civil Service and the acquisition of territory by the East India Company were agreed to, on the motion of Lord CLANRIOARDE. Some other businems was then despatched, after which their Lordships adjournecL. In the House of Commons, Sir G. GREY renewed, in an aLmended form, the motion made on Friday by Lord PXALMERSTON, " That in all cases when the seat of any member has been declared void by an election committee on the ground of bribery or treating, no motion for the issuing of a new writ shall be made without two days' previous notice being given in the Votes." Mr. DiSIABUL did not object to the resolution in this form. Mr. T. DuNcor,na moved by way of amendcment that the term of " seven days," originally proposed, be substituted for " two days." Upon a division the original resolution was carried by 190 to 138. The House then resolved itself into a committeB uponthe Probates and Letters of Administration Bill, after a short desultory discussion, chiefly upon the subject of compensationto officers. On the 2d (interpretation) clause, in which the "Court of Probate" is first mentioned, Mr. COLLIER proposed the first of a series of amendmentb, the object of which, he said, was, that as the superior courts of common law were by the Bill to be intrusted with nine-tenths of the contentiouls jurisdiction, they should have the other tenth, and that the non-contentious business should be transacted by a registrar and officers, under the control of the courts of common law. In order to raise the question, he moved that the word " offlice" be substituted for " court," in relation to common form busineEs. The ATToniEv-GrrFRAi opposed the amendments, observing that the business of a Court of Probate required great experience, great care, and very considerable knowledge of the mode of transaeting it, and that if transferred to the 15 Judges there might be contradictory decisions, even if their occupations admitted, which he did not believe, of their undertaking this additional business. The amendments were likewise opposed by other members, and Mr. CorISm. ultimately withdrew them. On the 5th clause, which contained a proviso that the pres,ent Judge of the Prerogative Court shall be the first Judge of the Court of Probate, Sir F. Kuvrv moved the omission of this proviso. The Arroi v-Grnxxr acknowvledged that It Imposed upon the learned Judge of the Prerogative Court an office which he might not desire to accept. The provis,o was expunged. On the 10th clause, establishing district registries, Sir E. PERRY moved to establish instead a public registry attached to each of the district courts, to be Iprer,ided over by the County Court Judge in all County Court districts, except those of the metropolis, the registrar to be under the control of the (ourt of Probate. The amendment was opposed byothe ATTotheGEmBrs and withdrawn. In the 34th clause, giving an appeal to the House o iIords, the words "requiring an intermediate Sppea }to HrU MAJoeTY in Council" were omnitted. Mr. A s moved that the ultimate Appellate Court be the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council-not the Houi e of Lords. This motion was opposed by the Soucrro.- GmuZN.Br. and other members, and upon a division it was negatived by 271 to 27. On the 40th clause, enacting that probates and administration to have effect in a partstof Egland may be granted in common form by district registrars, when the esta,te of the deceased is under 1,500L. personal, Mr. WESregAt moved to amend the clause by omitting the limitation, and making the probate cover al personalty, wherever situate. The AIOaNdY-GEwtEdraw aid the greatest pOsSible datger would be incurred, and great alarm would be occasioned to public bodies, if so large an authority were given to district registrars. The retention of the words containing the limitation was negatived by 162 to 131-a majority of 31 against the Government. The AndORNDY-GENERm L said this vote would destroy the Biv, and he would give the House an opportunity of reconsidering its most unfortunate vote. The committee then divided uponthe amendment moved by Ir. WBmon , to insert the words "and that such probate or letters of administration shall cover all personalty wherever situate ;" when the amendment was carried by 141 to 139-a majority of 2 against the Government. The CA NE G was then ordered to report progress. The Housemthen wentinto Committee upon the Summary Proceedings before Justices of the Peace Bill but, after a long discussion upon an incidental Point, the CHAmR3N was ordered to report progress. The report of the Committee of Supply was brought up and agreed to. The remaining orders were gone through, and, after some further business, the House adjourned at a quarter before 2 o'clock.
The Elections for Paris have terminated in the return of tbree Opposition candidates whose presence in the Chamber must be most profoundly distasteful to the Government. The inteligence which we publish this morning was received in London after midnight. It is, that General CAVAIG.NAc has been elected by 10,950 votes against 9,952 given to M. THIPAUT, the Government candidate, for the third electoral district of the French capital. For the fourth district M. OLLvUmi, the Opposition candidate, has beaten M. VARx, the Government nominee,by 11,005 votes against 10,096. For the seventh district, M. DAnuroN, the well-known publicist, who at this election represented the Opposition, has obtained 12,078 votes, whereas M. LAIQUETIN, the Government candidate, obtained but 11,038. A comparison of the figures will show how strenuous and determined the struggle was on either side. This is the first considerable check which the authority of the French EMPEROn has received, and yet its significance will be considerably exaggerated. As a demonstration it might be of great importance if the real brunt of the battle were to be encountered on the floor of the Chamber; but the E.MrEno is well aware that his power is not based upon that foundation. A Parliamentary majority to him is the laurel wreath round the sword; it is not the sword itself. The army and the peasant proprietors are the real safeguards of his power and the guardians of his tbrone. More than this, if the great majority of the metropolitan voters, who really dislikle the established order of things, and who have voted for the Opposition candidates, had believed that the effect of the votes which they have recorded would be to plunge Frauce once more into the revolutionary MIaelstromofl848,they would haveheldtheir hands. They may be very adverse to the present Government, but they are still more opposed to barricades, street fights, intestine turmoil, and the ruin of their private fortunes. They do not, however, shrink from the organization of a Parliamentary opposition, because the power against which they are acting seems so well established that its destruction, as they suppose, can scarcely follow from such an attempt. We cannot blame them. It is natural that they should seek for freedom of action and speech, and for some share in the direction of political affairs, although Frenchmen have grievously misused the opportunities which have been presented to them in the course of the last seventy years. From the days of Louis XVI. to the days of Louis PnmrPrP a stable Throne and an out-spoken Parliament have never long coexisted in France. We have little expectation that any fresh result will now be realized. The Chamber will destroy the E-MPEroR, or the EsrERon the Chamber, and the chances are much in favour of the latter alternative. We believe the ExRroaP wouIld welcome an Opposition in the Chamber which was not at the same time a threat against his dynasty and a conspiracy against his throne; and, allowance being made for the substantial differences which exist between his position and that of a constitutional Sovereign, he would be well satisfied that the grievances of the country should exbale in the rounded periods of a few orators, and that it shoulId no longer be possible to assert that his rule was the paralysis of political emotion, theadeath. blow to freedom of thougiht in France. Is this possible! Can the French EmPERno do this ? Can he place confidence enough in the moderation, the patriotism, the generosity of his opponents, to intruat them with power which they may turn at any moment against his supremacy ? Can he govern constitutionally if he would ? Many great things he has accomplished for the benefit of France; he has established tranquillity and order within the limits of the mother country; he has restoredalustre to the French arm, somewhat dimmed by the internecine strife of 1848; he has ever shown himself, financial mistakes apart, eager to further every scheme which could promote the material prosperity of the people. Al this he has accomplished, but the condition of his success has been the establishment of his own unquestioned and unquestionable supremacy. His tenure of power would not be worth six months' purchase in the face of a real Parliamentary Opposition, which could challenge, and with reason, his financial arrangements, and which could make constant appeals to the passions and prejudices of his violent and impulsive people. A despotism, whether founded upon universal suffagge or upon military force, or upon both, cannot flourish in the same soil with the Parliamentary system. The action of a stronig minority in the French Chamber could have but one object-the destruction of the Imperial power, and the substitution of another in itsplace. Who, in fact, would be its leader ? General CAVAIGNACI-in other words, the soldier who was for a while himself the ruler of France, and who actuaUy contended for the supreme authority against the present ERwioZlR. The presence of a rival, unless he be utterly helpless and disarmed, cannot be borne by an absolute monarch. The question, then, would seem to be, how far the Chamber can be suffered to exist, now that it has been invigorated by the return of these active and determined opponents of the Imperial Power. We believethere has been grievous miscalculation. in making any such appeal to the people, for the former Chamber was a ready implement in the hands of its master, and it would have been a far easier task, a far lighter shock to public feeling, to maintain an Assembly, no matter how servile, to which the country had become accustomed than by a fresh act of violence to stamp out once more the first spark of freedom beneath the armed heel of absolute power. The EMipsnon, no doubt, had been misinformed as to the popularity of his Government. Had the real feelings and opinions of the metropolitan electors been explained to him he would not have courted a demonstration which, construe it as mildly as you will, must be accepted as a protest against the Imperial system. The solution most acceptable to the EMLPEPoi would no doubt be a refusal on the part of General CAvAiGNAC to taWe the oath of fidelity to his Government, but we can scarcely suppose that the members returned on the Opposition votes will be guilty of so monstrous a blunder in tactics. This would be to declare that they cast aside the weapon of Parliamentary opposition as unworthy of their grasp. Fidelity to their constituents implies that they should take this oath, for otherwise they deprive those who have elected them of any resource save the barricades and an appeal to open force. This rejection of a position won after so long and strenuous a contest is so very improbable a contingency that it rwould be idle to speculate upon it. We must consider, then, the new Chamber as assembled, and the members as sworn. It wiU be an obstacle in the path of the present ETiPraon, which no doubt he will tolerate as long as it does not interfere with his popularity or power, but which he will brush aside the moment it endeavours to make its weight felt in opposition to his will.. As yet he has the strength to carry out such a design, for he is not dealing with a power, but with an institution, which may become one if he suffer it to grow to vigour and maturity. The previous career of the EUPERoE would seem to prove that he is not the man to hesitate in such a choice, or to shrink from such a difficulty.
The decisions of Election Committees during the present Session have hitherto been favourable to the sitting members. The cases of the various petitioners who failed may perhaps have been munsually weak, but it may also be observed that there is generally a fashion or a bias in the judgments of all the Committees which sit at any particular time. A few years since the extreme desire which was felt or expressed for purity of election led to many acta of individual injustice. The Corrupt Practices Act, enforced perhaps by a recollection of the wholesome severity of Parliament, has now in a great measure put an end to the evil, and consequently diminished the alarm with which it was regarded. Committees are now reasonably unwilling to deprive a member of bis seat because some indiscreet agent may, without authority from his principal, have given a voter a pint of beer or promised him a consideration for his support. The uncertainty of election law may in some degree be attributed to the unprofessional tribiunals by which it is administered, but the very nature of the inquiry opens a waide field for the exercise of discretion. Not one petitioner in twenty would succeed in unseating his opponent if the strict rules which prevail in coturts of justice were applied to the proof of bribery or treating. Scandalous cases of the kind which 31r. OLIv EIRA SO gratuitously proved against himself are, happily, of rare occurrence. In modern times candidates neither pay money nor promiise it, nor do they open publichouses for their supporters. According to the rule of law, no agent can make his principal responsible for his acts inless he is acting -within the scope of his delegated authority. A gentleman must pay for his coachman's want of skill if his carriage runs over a passenger, but he is not liable for the damage which his servant may commit if he engages in a drunken riot in the street. In actions for penalties or indictments for misdemeanour under the Corrupt Practices Act no candidate will be exposed to an unfavourable verdict, unless he has either committed an illegal act or instructed an agent to commait it on his behalf. Committees have exceptionally held the sitting member responsible for the unlawful proceedings of any agent employed in the conduct of the election. The greater or less stringency which exists in the definition of agency will generally be foind to depend on the state of opinion which prevails in the House of Commons as to the necessity of restraining corruption. Tho unseemly exhibitions of twenty years ago are happily forgotten. Partisans no longer announce the result of the inquiry on the first publication of the list of the Committee. Political feeling may in many instances influence the judgments of menmbers, but it no longer constitutes the avowved basis of their decision. In all the inquiries which are alreadyterminated there have been substantial or plausible grounds for the rejection of the petitions. Regard for the choice of the electors and for the rights of the sitting member is as legitimate an influence as a patriotic desire to punish corruption wherever it is found. There ix an anomaly in overrut]ing the decision of a majority of voters because one of their number may have accepted a bribe. The grounds of petition have included several of
Among other reforms wanting somebody to take {hem up in good earnest, there is one which we commeend to the attention of the zealous but unemployed ngricultural interest. Our great landOwners want something to do, and are distrustful of schemes that promise to double the produce of the soil. One thing, however, they may easily do, if they will set their heads to work, which will vastly increase its marketable value. Can they not do away with the greater part of that immense difficulty and cost which encumbers the mere process of buying and selling land ? It is an axiom, as Lord BuoUGIAx observed at the anmual -festival of the Law Araendment Society, that in England the transfer of an acre of land is the most difficult thing in the world. Of couane, it may be aid, the cost of transfer will increase in proportion to the smallness of the quantity. But, under the simplest conditions and for very ordinary quantWtes, the cost is altogether out of proporVjon to the value; and the result is, that 7 a man has a hundred pounds he invests them in something of which he will get a hundred pounds' worth-not in land, for the simple reason that of that commodity he will get only 701. or 801. worth, having to pay the difference for the lavw costs, knowing also that should he ever want to sell it he will find purchasers deterred by the same consideration. In fact, land in amal quantities and in ordinary situations is both difficult to obtain and difficult to get rid of. No doubt, buying and selling is an expensive process in many other articles. If a gentleman wants a horse he must pay at least half as much again as it is worth; if he wants to part with one he cannot get half its value. The difterence feeds the whole tribe of horsedealers and their various auxiliaries. It is the same with furniture, pictures, and a number of otber things. The professional buyer says, " It is nought, it is nought," even if he expects to make ever so much by the bargain. In these cases the public are in the hands of the professional dealers, who know a great deal more about the article than the public, and have made it the business of their lives. They have a right to get somethlng out of the transaction. We have no objection io jobbers. We are quite content there should be regular jobbers in land. But there is no such class as land-jobbers. In the transfer of land the diff'erences lost to the public do not go to a class more knowing than others in the value of land. They are not the natural reward of superior klnowledge or enterprise. No; the immense loss upon transfers has nothing to do with value, with uncertainty of value, or fluctuations of value. It is suffered equally upon land of the most certain and of the most speculative value; upon land that a hundred people are ready to buy at a guinea a square yard, and upon land of which a thousand acres may or may not be worth having at all. 'lThe cost is in legal forms; in documents ten times as long as need be; in inquiries into title repeated over and over again, even where there cannot be a question, and never was a doubt. But the most serious chronic depreciation of land is that which arises from the nature of the title itself, and it is one upon which the Legislature, often invoked, has every right to interfere. Whatever damages the property of the commonwealth is a public nuisance, and ought to be abated. Now, that the nature of certain titles does produce this damage is evident from the fact that an iramense amount of property passes at a lower value, and remains in a lower condition, on account of its title. We might not be able to pronouuce at once on the extent to which this principle shotild carry us. We may not be ready forthwith to ask for an Act converting all the houses on the BEDFoitD estate from leaseholds into freebolds, even though we might believe that the process would be vastly advantageous to the BEJ)rOltD family, to the lessees, and to the metropolis at large. But when nothing can be alleged, and notlhing is alleged, in defence of a copyhold, or some other tenure, and where the advantage of a general enfranchisement is admitted on all sides, then it is mere prudery to question the right of thc Legislature to step in and do a general benefit. When a legal form, itself the creation of the Legislature, clogs, impairs, and imperils the enjoyment of property, exposing it to uncertainty and to periodical difficulty and loss, of course it prevents the investment of capital in the improvement of that property. It deters the occupier, or qtasi proprietor, from raising substantial buildings, and from giving his heart to the estate. It prevents, in fact, that very thing whiclh it is the chief object of political and legal institutions to promote; not only for the happiness of individuals, but for the good of the whole nation. Wlhen it is evident there is such an incubus upon property, and when it tells its own tale by the depreciation of property, then surely the Legislature may set boldly to work, as it would to rid the community from terror of foreign aggression or social disorder. Yet just suclh an incubus is every description of title to land which depreciates it, which renders its tenure precarious, which discourages improvement, and sends away to any mad speculation, or to any foreign scheme, the capital which might otherwise be fLxed on our owvn soil. It is true that the original imperfection of the tenure is often the least defect in a title ; and even in the case of the best freeholds accident, or capricious disposition, mortgages, and settlements, may complicate an estate to an extent seriously injurious to the public interest. The owner may so bequeath or so encumber a property that it shall not be worth anybody's while to risk more than a yearly occupation upon it. In this case there will be no improvements, no roads, no houses, no drainage, nothing done, except wvhat the State in some formal and cumbrous manner mnay compel, on the property of a whole district. WYe have heard of complications so manifold and absurd that we should not be believed if we were to state them, except by the lawyers. In these cases no man in his senses will spend his money on an estate which the caprice of one man, the death of another, the disagreement of half a dozen others, and possibly some other contingency, will suddenly take away from him, or only leave in his occupation at an unreasonable cost. But there is no valid reason why land and houses should not be rendered as easy and cheap of transfer as money in the funds. They can be registered and described as easily as the Three per Cents.; divisions, accumulations, and all changes can be perpetually entered in public books, as easily as an inventory made of the furniture of a house; and the transfer can be done simply by the substitution of one name for another. Thus, the title once established, there would be no occasion to scrutinize it over and over again every time a property is sold or a mortgage contracted. The work once done wMould stand good for aU purposes; and if the lawyers had not quite such heavy costs on each conveyance of land, they would find they would have many more such conveyances, that land was in more request, and that more money was spent upon it.

AMERICA. (BY ELECrRIt AC D IIFTEBNAT1O1A TeLEGP) LIVERPOOL, TuVSDAY MosNaNG. The Royal mail steamship Canada, Captain Shannon, has arrived with advices from New York to the 24th ult. She brings $1,300,088 apecie on freight. The Canada experienced adverse winds almost the entire passage. On the 26th ult., at 6 30 p.m., the Canada passed the screw steamship City of Baltimore, hence for New York, and on the 6th inst., at 10 a.m., passed a war ateamer bound north. The Royal mail steamship Persia, hence, arrivedc at New Yorkonthe 23d ult., andthe screw steamship Khersonese, hence, at Portland. I The Persia made the ran from Liverpool to New York in nine days twelve hours. Major-General Wooll was dangerously ilL General Scott, it is reported, had been called to Washington to perfect arrangements for the despatch of troops to Utah. The troops were in motion. Mr. Anderson, the Commissioner of Coinage, was about to leave for England. According to the Herald, he was instructed not to yield the decimal system. It is reported that Lieutenant Craven had received orders to build boats for the survey of the Isthmus of Darien, with the view of forming a ship canal. Mr. Read, the Envoy to China, at a publie dinner ridiculed what is considered diplomacy, and said:- "A character for diplomatic skiU does a man harm. I am in no danger of suffering in this way, for there has been paid to me by some who have criticized my appointment what I cannot but suspect was an unintentional compli. mnent in being described as one 'whoRy without diplomatic experience,' which I admit freely, a spea cimen of a natural curiosity known the world over as a Philadelphia lawyer, and with some share of tact, shrewdness, and common sense.', Now, it seems to me the point of the praise, if such was meant, lies in this last attribute, for, after all, gentlemen, it is ' common sense, enlightening a loyal American heart, which must guide me now. China is a place where the homely quality called 'mother wit' is very much in requisition One approaches Chinese diplomacy very rmuch as the navigator approaches the Chinese coasts. There aro no lighthouzes; no buoys, no signals of friendly coun. sel or guidance. They want no strangers, and they help none to come. The gallant ship which is to bear me must find her way into their ports and rivers by the skiU and courage of the American men on board of her, and wiU anohor there without a word of welcome except from strangers like herself; but, thus piloted, she wil be safe and respected under her flag, aggressive in no act, for her errand is a peacofal one, but ready to resent insult and to give prompt protection where protection is due. Id mission, I sincerely hope, may not be unlike my ship. I can honestly say I go abroad with no despondency as to the fature, no awant of self-reliance, if the anchorage which my education has given me only holds. I am proud to belong to that school which believes in the traditionary policy of this nation as it first came from the lips of Washington, and as it has been maintained with certain mischievous aberrations ever since. I have a sus pi cion there is more danger from too many treaties than two few, especiaUy of undertaking to regulate other people's concerns. Let me not, either here or elsewhere, be understood as saying that from the legitimate communion and sympathies of the civilized nations of the world ,with regard to China the United States should stand coldly aloof ; almost every practical question to be there determined has relations to others besides ourselves. We have nothing to ask that othersmaynotshare,butwechoose to ask it in our own way, and in our own good time. No one can find fault. It can be no part of the duty of an American representative to be the sullen spectator of what others are doing, and have a perfect right to do, to exchange no word of counsel, to refuse or omit to confer frankly and fully on matters of common interest. By one of those sudden whirls our planet sometimes makes China and Chinese affairs bave presented themselves in most imposing interest to the eyes of mankind; they disturbed Grcsat Britain the other day. It occupies the attention of the two great empires of continental Euirope. No civilized nation has more direct a4d important relations to China than the United States." Accounts fromVera Cruz to the 6th of June report continuedpreparationsfordefence. TheUnitedStates' Minister had, it is said, remonstrated against the maimer in which Crabbe and his :Fiibusters were executed at Sonora. A British squadron had, it is reported, appeared at Sacrificios to enforce the payment of $250,000 seized by the revolutionists of San Louis. The Governmnet had offered I56 per rut. Of the import duties to pay the amount; but the proposition was refused by the owners, mostly English, who wanted cash. Iglesias, the Minister of Finance, had levied a war-tax of 6 per cent. on property. Her Majesty's ship Termagant was at Vera Cruz. At New York trade continued extremely quiet, and no improvement waslooked for til after the 4th inst., when it was probable the increased withdrawal of bonded goods on account of the reduction of duties would occasion increased animation. There was a marked absence of speculation. There was a brisk demand for money, despite the dullness of trade; and the discount houses, taking advantage of the Bank contractions, had slightly advanced their rates. The Bank statement was unexpectedly favourable, showing a gain of over $750,000. There was a fair accumulation of depesits, and a moderate curtailment of loans. Prime commercial paper was quoted at eight to nine per cent., according to maturity, and fair names at 10 to 15 per cent. In stocks the transactions had been large, with a downward tendency. There had been a moderate business done in exchange, but the market in general clossed flat. We quote bills on London 9i to 9l) per cent. Cotton still maintained its buoyancy, and small sales were effected at an advance of c. on middlings owing to thePersia's advices. There had been a good inquiry for flour at an advance of 10c. to 20c. There was a demand for export to Spain. The crop accounts were generally favourable, and there was an increased breadth of ground under cultivation. Red wheat had advanced 5c. per 601b. The supply was light. Indian corn had advanced 5c. to 6c., closing with an upward tendency. Inporkprices had receded about lOc.,the market closing very dull. Beef was steady, with a fair home trade demand. Bacon was scarce and wanted, at full prices. Lard was lower anddulL Turpentine was steady, with alimited supply. Iron was very quiet. Tobacco was unchanged, and no alteration was anticipated before the new tariff came into operation. Common rosin was still scarce and prices well sustained. Freights were unchanged. To Liverpool, for cotton,2s. 6d.to 3s. per bale; flour, 6d. per barrel; grain, 2,d. to 4d. per bushel. To London, flour Is. to is. 3d. per barrel. To Havre, cotton Jc. per lb. Sailors were in fair supply, at lower wages. At New Orleans on the 23d the Persia's advices caused an advance in the price of cotton of Ic. The middling qualities improved most. The sales of the preceding three days were 9,500 bales. The telegraphic despatch reports the receipts at New Orleans as 21,000 bales less than last yeaxr; at all the southern ports less by nearly 600,000 bales. SHIPPING IlNTTRELLIGENBlE.

THE GLASGOW POISONING CASE. TRIAL OF MADELEINE SMITH. (Br FLWI TGrAPI) EDINBURGH, JusLy 6. MONDAY-SIXTr DAy. The judges decided to reject the evidence of the deceased's memorandum book, acid no further evidence of importance was offered for the Crown. Thirty-one witnesses were examined for the defence. Robert Baker resided with deceased in Edinburgh in 1851, when he was very low-spirited about a disappointment in love, and once threatened to throw himself out of the window, and another time spoke of throwing himself off the pier. Several witnesses from Dundee stated that on one occasion, on hearing of the marriage of a lady he had been in love with, he took up a large knife from the counter and threatened to stab himself; that he several times threatened or spoke of self-destruction by different means; that he had once spoken of giving some horses arsenic while in France, to give them wind for their journey, and, when asked if he was not afraid to do so, said, " So far from that, I have taken it myself." He said he took it to relieve pain. He had also been seen to take poppy seed in considerable quantities. To one witness he had spoken of asog arsenic regularly. To Alexander Millar, of Glasgow, he had once said that he thought it no sin for a person to take his own life and thus get out of the world if he could not be happy in this. Witness said deceased had frequently severe bowel complaints. Janet Christie had heard deceased, and Agnes M.Millan had heard prisoner speak of using arsenic for the complexion, and several druggists deposed to having been on occasions asked for it for that purpose. William Roberts and Charles Baird spoke to occasions on which deceased had been taken very suddenly and severely ill with vomiting and purging. Several witnesses deposed to deceased being somewhat untruthful as well as boastful. Charles Adam, druggist, of Coatbridge, deposed to a person of appearance like deceased purchasing laudanum at his shop on a Sunday afternoon, about the end of March. James Dickson, druggist of Baillieston, on the way from Coatbridge to Glasgow, spoke of a person extremely like the photograph of deceased coming in on a Sunday about the same time, complaining of bowel complaint, and getting laudanum. Miss Eirk, daughter of a druggist in Gallowgate, GTlasgow, deposed to giving* medicine on Sunday evening to a person strikingly like the photograph, but did not remember what it was. It was not arsenic. Wlitnesses deposed to the wide circulation of an article in Oharmbers' Journal, Black-wood's Miagazine, &c., in which the use of arsenic as a cosmetic is spoken of. Letters of the prisoner were put in, in which she remonstrates with deceased against his threat of suicide. Doctor Pateraon, of Leith, had attended seven cases of suicide by arsenic, in which the suicides, except one who confessed after recovery, denied to the last having taken poison. Two storekeepera of manufacturing chymists spoke to the extensive use of arsenic in their premises, and the possibility of its abstraction. Janet Smith, youngest sister of prisoner, deposed to going to bed with her on Sunday, the 22d of March, and their rising together. Dr. Lawrie, of Glasgow, and Dr. Douglas MLagan of Edinburgh, spoke to the possibility of putting arsenic in water and laving it about th face without injurious results. This closed the case for the defence. On Tuesday the Lord-Advocate and the Dean of Faculty will address the jury, and the case is expected to terminate on Wednesday.

The expenditure of the lmigration Department, icluding the quarantine establishment, &c., amounted to 8,S151., and the amount of emigrant tax realized in the season was 4,8741. (at Quebec and Montreal). &review of the emigration of 1856 gives very satisfactory results. The emigrants were uniformly healthy, and landed free from complaint. A large proportion of the English and Scotch were farmers and mechanics, the former generally im comfortable circumstances. The amount of capital introduced into the colony bas been large, but the exact amount is nuknown. The demand and inquiry for labour in Western Canada throughout the season have been far in advance of the supply, and continued applil cations were received from almost every section of the province complabning of the scarcity of labour and the difficulty, as weeU as impossibility, of procuring domestio servants, and requesting that emigrants might be sent to them. This it vas found impossible to do. With reference to tho prospects of the season of 1857, the reporta from all quarters indicato a general growing prosperity and active busness employment both as regards commerce and agriculture. The efficient and speedy direct communication by steam between Canada and England, and the completion of the Grand Trunk Railway from Quebec to Stratford are advantages whioh, combined with a healthful climate, productive soil, cheap, land, unsurpassed means of internal communication and ample security for life and property, cannot assuredly fail to exercise a most imerrtant influence upon future emigration; and it isthe opinion of the emigra tion agent at Quebec, that during the current season Canada will receive a large addition to its population, sad with it a share of the wealth, intelligence, and industry of the mother country. The prospects for the working classes, especially in West Canada, are very favourable. Of 8,781 emigrants to Canada in 1856, 65 were bakers, 35 butchers, 18 braziers, smiths, and plumbers, 14 printers I and bookbinders, 11.5 bricklayers and stonemasons, 10 cabinetmakers and turners, 308 carpenters and joiners, 50 cart and wheelwrights, 7 coachmakers, 27 coopers, 4 curriers and tanners 10 dyers, .35 engineers, 49 gardeners, 12 hatters, 83 millers and millwrights, 61 miners, 104 merchants and clerks, 9 moulders and foundrymen, 20 painters and glaziers, 2 papermakers, 13 plasterers, 5 ropemakers, 11 saddlers, 2 sailmakers, 9 sawyers, 11 shipbuilders, 227 shoemakers, 216 smiths, 13 stopecutters, 206 tailors, 51 watch and clockmakers, 4 wool and flax dressers, 65 weavers, 32 " servants," 2,342 farm labourers, and 4,338 common labourers. 808,908emigrants have landed at Quebec since the year 1829. The emigration to New Brunswick has fallen off greatly; it was only 712 last year; but there will be a great demand for all Idnds of labour, skilled and unskilled, this year. Female servants are grestly in requestk and will readily obtain employment.

The ftllonjing statement appears in one of the mnoring papers. It was reported yesterday that the Crown nmean to produce fresh evidence at the adjourned investigation on Thursday next, and it is said that Spollen's son will be one of the new witnesses for the prosecution - " A rusmuir preN ailed through town yesterday that Mrs. Spcllen, the wite of the man charged with the murder of the late Mr. Lttle. bad taken poison, and that she died from the effects of it on Saturday evening. On inquiry, boat ever, it turntd out that the report was incorrect-at least in so far as the statement that she was dead. The rolice maitain astzict reserve with respecttothe exact ciscumstasces from which the rumour first emanatedbuit it appears that she has been for some days extremely ill, and has been attended by two medical gentlemen. Yesterday she was so much improved as to be able to sit up in bed, although she still continues very weak and depreFsed in spirits. It is stated that she feels much .nnoyed at a statement which appeared in some of the newspapers, that she bad assisted at the alleged hiding by her husband of the money recently discovered on the railway premises She declares tbat, so far from having given him any assistance, she refused even to watch for him lest be should be discovered while he was engaged, as represented, in disposing of tbe money. She also manifests annoyance at the statements whioh have been made imputing to her an indifference as to her position or to public opinion respecting the step which she has taken. She seems altogether very much affected by the painful situation in which she is placed, and frequently expresses a desire not to live any longer." HARVEST PR2OS'ECTS. AIUthough a week of broken weather had begun to create someuneasiness here, there is nothing in the last accounts from the provinces to wararant the belief that the crops have in the slightest degree suffered from th e late heavy rains. On the contrary, all the agricultural reports speak in sanguine terms of the coutinued prospect of an early and abundant harvest, and special mention is made of the flourishing condition of the potatoe crop, which, save in an isolated instance or so, shows as yet no symptom of the old disease. In Dublin, on Saturday, there was one of the heaviest falls of rain that has occurred for a number of years past. Fortunately, however, the shower did not last more than 20 minutes, but in that brief space of time the city was . completely flooded, the waters choking up the soewer- age, and pouring into cellars and other low-lying habitations, to the dismay of the humble occupants, who were quite unprepared for the visitation. This morningy is extremely wet, and the air cold and ungenial.
."THE QUEEN AGAINST SIREDWARD CONROY, BART." WNe are authorized to state that this case, in whioh a rule absolute was granted for a criminal information against Sir Edwsard Conroy, upon the unanimous opinion of the Judges of the Queen's Bench, as reported in our paper of the 2d of June, has been brought to a conclusion by an apology being offered to MIr. Barker, which has been accepted by him. Tho particulars are contained in the following letters:- " Upper Grosvenor street, June 12. "My dear Sir,-I received this morning a letter signedby the wlhole of the Wokiagham Bench-with the exception of Najor Court and Mr. Maitland, the absence of whose names is owing to the circmnstance of their not being present at the Bench on the occasion when it was drawn up, 'but of whose cordial concurrence with its object and substance I cRn entertain no doubt-in which they express their opinion that an apologyis doe to you from Sir Edward Conroy for the language used by him towards you, and earnestly request ise to present such an apology to yoa in his behalf, with the view of its leading to an amicable settlemcnt of the differences between you. "In conf')riiity with the opinions xpressed in this letter, Sir Edward Conroy has unreservedly plced himself in my hands, and has requested me to tender you, on his behalf the fullest apoloey which it is in his power to make, both for his conduct towards you at the Bench and for the injurious expressions contained in the two letters to yon on the subject of the Hurst vestry meeting, which he deeply regrets having used. II I will only add the expression of nmy earnest hope that, on the receipt of th s communication, you will consider that youi have sufficiently vindicated your character from any imputation which might have been suipposed to attach to it, had you pernittel Sir Edward Conroy's remarks to pass unnoticed, and that you will, in a frank and neighbourly spirit, accede to the saiigestion with which I conclude,-that the whole affAir should here terminate, and that all remembranco of it Phmuld, as far as possible, be effaced. " I rpiiiain, my dear Sir, yours very trul.v "To George Barker, Esq. "J. WALTER." " Arborfield, June 26. "My dear Sir,- I beg to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter of apology which you have been good enough to address to Mr. Barker on my part, and to assure you that I adopt its contents. *If Mr. Barker requires me to pay his costs I am willing to do Eo. I I liavo only to add that I have no objection whatever to pnblicity heirg giveni to this letter, as well as to your own, if ir. Barker wvnli sit.

SAUCr roi0 THE GOOSE SAUCEFOIt THE GANDER, -in the olden tiL,e a prisoner refusing to plead to arraignmnent was subjected to torture, to extort the declaration guilty or not guilty. The process was loadiss. tho chest till the desired formality was squeezed out of it. Humanity has long abolished th:s barbarous usage, but it stiU tolerateo anotber application of torture, for the purpose of extorting the pretence of agreement from juries. The barbarous misode of efflctiog tlis object is the very opposite to that resorted tu in fornmr timcs to compel the plea to arraignD,ent. liutead of lbading the breast, the stomach is kept empty, and jurors who scruple to deliver a verdict against conscience are subjected to the pangs of hunger and thirst, and, in wvinter, cold to boot. We noticed an e.xample of this applicatimoi of torture upon one of the bitterest days of the list winter, in a crinminal court. This week wo have an instance in a civil case, and after many hours of privation and suffering from exhaustion, the parties consented t grant the jury sonic sligiht refreshment. The defendant, indeed, was willing to agree to a meal, but the plaintiff stood out forshort cemnmons. Need we add that the verdict wsas for thu de.e:dsukt, for, as Sosia rules that he with whom he dines is the true Amphytrion, so, surely, he by or through wlionu wo di :c is the party in the right. Now, if this had been a criwinal trial no compromise could have been made, and the jtury must at leasb have been subjected -o ver. prolongeil tortu4re. It is possible that a juror may actuallybe starved to death, or driven to an act of cannibalism. Imagine an obstinate juror devoured to the ones by his brethren. The remedy for this absurd and inconvenienlt cuKnmnJ iJ to abolish the rule of unanimity, and to give the verliet to a certain majority. And let it always be nrae in mind that the pretence of unauimity extoTted by the pains of ini-ition or hunger is in reality a lie, delivered in violation .4 the oaths of the jurors dissenting at beart. But if the lawyersinsist on adheringto this barbarous praotice, let them at least be consistent, and carry it a step higher, where agreement is much more important than in the jury-box. The jadges are often divided in opinion on pints of law of thcs very highest importance. Why not ock them up. and starve them into accord? Some few years ago the Bench was evenly divided upon a point in the remarkatle came of the Birds, acquitted of murder, and afterwards tried for a felonious assault, and the different interpretatit,ns wbich these luminaries put upon a statate, and the little respect they showed for opinions counter to their own, were a matter of no small public scandaL Surely starvatiii would cure this evil, and bring the judgments of the highest legal authorities into harmonv. Differences in lJnro should always be composed by the samle great ti ier, v bich will be found, no doubt, not less effectual oporating zipJII the judges of the land thana on the 'wild beasts of tle jungle. And then, when judges direct the locking sip of juries, cnd the denial of food, drink, and fuel, they wil I he able to Pay that they do not exempt themselves from thc vholesome regime to which they subject juries, in order tu obtain the great end of a unanimous decision.-Exa,e eipr.

TREE LATE, FRTGHTFUL ACCIDENT ON THE NORTH KENT RAILWAY. On Saturday Thomas Perry, 29, driver, Edward Whiffen, 24, fireman, David Wild, 47, and John Griffiths, 23, signal. man,in the employ of the Sonth-Eastem RaUway Company, were brought up for re-exsmination before Mr. TRAILL at the Greenwich Police-court, charged with neglecting their duty, whereby a passenger train was run into at the Lewisham station of the North Kent Railway on the night of Sunday, the 28th ult., and 11 persons killed and several otbers seriously injured. Mr. TRAILL said he intended going on first with the cass against the driver and fireman; and the other prisoners were removed. After several witresse; had been examined, Mr. TnRArL intimated that he should take no more evidence that day against the driver and fireman, but would remand them, with the other prisoners, to a fature day, for the completion of the case. David Wild. 47, signalman at the Lewisham station, and John Gliffiths, 23, signalman at the Blackheath sta. tioo, were brought up yesterday, at the Greenwich policecourt, charged with neglect of daty in signaUing trains on the North Kenrt Railway on the night in question. Samuel Sax-oy, of 9, Honesdale, Lewisham, said,-I am offce porter at the Lewisham station, and was on duty on Sunday night week. I remember the 9 115 train from Strood coming to the semaphore signaL. Mr. Nelson, the stationmaster, called me from the down over to the up Platform. This was about three minutes after the arrival of the train. Mr. Nelson told me to take charge of the signals while Wild went down to ascertain if there was any room in the train for passengers. Wild went away and was absent about three minutes. I took charge of the signals, and noticed that the dial-needle stood at 'stopalU up" for Blackheath. No change was made in the dial, and no signal given while I was there. Vincent Thomas Thompson, No. 1, King's Bench-walk, and of 9, Berners-street, Oxford-street, special pleader, called,-On Sunday night week I went to the Lewisham station for the purpose of taking the train to London, and arrived there at 19 or 20 minutes to 1L I walked straight upstairs to the up platform. I saw an engine and train standing a few yards from the platform, towards Blackheath. I saw Wild standing by the box that contains the telegraph signals. I looked on the dial, and understood from Wild there was another train, and that standing at the station was not the one I was to go by. On looking at the dial I saw the indicator standin" at "atop all up" and "all clear down." There weretwo aials. I saw both, and, to the bhst of my belief, the signal "stop all up" was on both dials. I left the signal box about two nminutes before the collision. During the time I was stand. ing at the signal box I looked at it two or three times and saw no change in it. I never saw the indicator at "all clear up." If either of the indicators standing at " stop all up" had been moved to " aU clear up" for a period of five or six minutes before I left the box I must have seen it. I saw no signal given by Wild or any other person. I saw two re a lights, one obove the other, at the Lewisham Junction. About the time the Beckenham train passed I saw the lower red light changed to green, and after it had passed the light was again changed to red. This was about five or six minutes before the collision. I looked at the dial at the moment of the change of lights naiued, expecting a change, and that the stationary train would move on. There was no change in the dial. I heard a sound in the telegraph box like the sounding of a clock or a bell. This was about two minutes and a-half before the accident. My impression is it struck once. I thought it the duty of the signalman to do something. Wild was near the window of the box when the beU rang. I did not see hini do anything. I did not observe anyone else go into the box. I theu moved a little way down the platform, and about two minutes and a half afterwards the accident happened. On looking at the Dlan of the dial now produced the needle was standing at "-stop all up" at the lower part of the left. hand corner of the left hand division. It was also standinv at " stop all up" on the uprer part of the left side of the right division. Wld was in charge of the signal box when I went on to the platform. I did not see the witness Saxby in charge of the signal box while I was there. Mr. TnlILL said the presumption was strongly in favour of Wild, the Lewisham signalman, that he was not to blame, and, as the solicitor for Griffiths couldnotoffer any opposition, he woald, therefore be discharged from custody. Mr. Ilees snid he proposed then to examine Wild as a witness. The witness was then examined, and deposed as fol. lows :-l was night porter at the Lewisham station on th night of Sunday week. I took charge of the signal box at 2S minutes after 10. Shortly afterwards I received the slenal from Blackheath of the departure of a train. I did not know at that time what train it was. On receiving the signal I gave in return to Blackbeath, "stop aU up." The meaning of that was the train might come on, but that no other train should do so nntil that signal was taken off. Onreceiving the signal I made an entry in my book of the time of receiving it,-viz., 10 32. I did not enter the description of the train, because I did not know what it was I rmust have given the signal of '- aU clear up" to Blackheath before any other train coDud properly have left that station. I never gave any such signal as "all clear Up" from the time I came on duty to the time of the accident. If there is an entry in theBlackheath book as a signal of " all clear up" having been given at 10 48 that is not correct. l remained in my box from the time of my receiving the signal at 10 32 for five or six minutes, and then Mr. Nelson,lthe station-master, came and asked if there was any one to take my place. I said, "There is Saxby," and he caUed him and told me to go and see if there was anv room in the train to take some pas. sengers to London. Saxby was then called over to take charge of the signal box while I went. I was away about three or four minutes, and found Saxby still in charge of the signal box. I am certain I returned to the signal box before 10 48, and remained in oharge of it till the time of the accident.During thattimeno personhadtheopportunityof entering tho signal box or altering thesignal. Noonewentinto the box. I received a signal-two beats on the bell-from Blackheath, about a minute and a-half before the accident. I was then standing outside the door of the signal box, near the window, so that I could see the 9 15 train standing at the station. I was looking towards the Lewisham Junction, and could also see the dial of my instrument. When I heard the signal I knew it came from Blackheath by the striking of a bell, and not the gong. I looked at the dial, and sent the signal to Blackheath, "stop all up." I gave tha signal at 10 32. The signal has never been altered since. On receiving the signal of two beats on the bell from Blackheath I gave no signal in reply. It was out of the rules to do so. the signal of " stop all up" having beenalready given. I did not give any signal that is not entered in my book. The signal of two beats I did not enter, that being also out of the rules, except such signals are acknowledged. The signal of two beats on the bel was received about a minute and a half before the accident. This being the whole of the evidence, Mr. TIRAILL said it would be his duty to commit the prisoner for trial at the Central Criminal Court, but he would be brought up with the prisoners Perry and Whiffen, who stood remanded until Thursday next,

THE FATAL ACCIDENT AT SHBEHWSBUBY. Yesterday afternoon the coroner's jury assembled at the Gmuldhall to inquire into the circumstances a'tending the death of Edward Joseph Ditcher, one of the 10 unfortunate persons who lost their lives on Friday night in oonsequence of the temporary bridge across the Severn, in connexion with Jullien's fegt, giving way. The room was greatly crowded. Mr. W. Harley Bayley, mayor of the borough, gave evidence to the effect that in consequence of the complaints made of the injury to the quarry from Jullien's fete of last year, he gave permission to 3Mr. Hay to use the Island of l'oplars for the late flte, on the condition that 51tr. Hay emgloyed acompetent person to construct a bridge of boats y which to approach the island. Mr. Hay mentioned the name of Mr. Randal, arohitect, ant stated that he intended to have two bridges, one for the a pproach to and another for persons leaving the island. Witness approved Nfr. Randal as the architect for the bridges. It was afterwards found that one bridge only was erected. Thomas Jones, blacksmith, Smithfield-road, deposed to his being on the boat when it went down, and he attributed the accident to the weakness of the central boat, and not to any persons rocking it. Mr. Thomas Jones, draper, said, he went down with the boat. Before it sank the boat swayed a little, and he believed that was occasioned by persons rocking. He did not hear any person cry "Don't shake the boat." Both witness and his daughter were precipitated into the 'water, and narrowly escaped drowning. Sarah Beetlestone, servant to Mr. Wilkes, Princess-street, stated, that she was returning from the island about 1i) o'clock on Friday night, andas she came along the boat, near the end, she saw two porters from the railway station 'rowing" (rocking) the heat backwards and forwards as hard ars they could. One of the men was very short, and the other a little taler, but she could not swear to them. She saw the boat sink, and went into the water with it. Mr John Evans, sen., carpenter, said, he was employed by Mr. Hays to superintend the constructiOn of the bridge, under Mr. Randal. He did not know who furnished the workmen. When the accident happened he had one foot on the boat that sank and the othler on the barge. He should think there were I00 or more persons on the boat that sank, but it was too dark to ascertain the exact numaber. Mr. Tisdale, borough surveyor, said, he examined the bridge of boats on Saturday by o?-der of the coroner, ir. Henry Keate. In his opinioa it was not sufficiently strong for the purpose for which it was erected. (By ELECTRIC AND LNTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH.) M1r. Pountney Smith, architect, and Mr. Townsend. engineer, corroborated Mr. Tisdale's evidence as to the unfitness of the bridge for the purpose. Police-Constable Broughall and other witnesses deposed to persons rocking the bridge, two of whom were a short time in custody, but escaped at the time of the accident, and had not since been identified. A verdict of " accidental death" was returned in each case. IEhe jury condemned the construction of the bridge as unsafe, and, at the same time, expressed regret that sufficient police precautions had not been observed aud that the safety of the bridge had not been previously tested by the borough surveyor.

THE LATE Mr.. DouIJrAs JERROI,D.-The performance of the amateur company at the Gallery of Illtus. tr-tion, iB the presence of Her Majesty, as recorded in ths Court Circular- on Saturday last, is not wholly unconnected. with the tribute paid to the memory of the late Mr. Dou-las Jerrold. The Prozzen Deep, written by Mr Wilkie Collns, and per.'ormed last winter by Mr. Dickens, his family, and some of his most intimate friends, for the amusement of a private circle, is to bh repeated by the same company of performers (with one exception) on Saturday next, for the benefit of the "Jerrold Fund." Her Majesty, we understand, was requested to be present on the occasion, and although she refused, through fear of establishing a precedent, she expressed a strong desire to witness the play. Hence the performance on Saturday last, which was stri-tly private, no persons being admitted but those who were specially invited, or whose presence was sanctioned by Her Majesty. The plot of the piece was described in our columns when it was originaUy produced at Mr. Dickens's residence, and we then took occasion to comment on the excellence of the actors, which wiU endure the test even of a high professional standard. The performance of Saturday next will be precisely the same in every particular as that which took place before Her Majesty, comprising, in addition to the Fro.en Deep. the favourite farce Two o'Clock in the Mornira.

Immediately after the consecration'the body of an old gentlemen, aged 96, a native of Sweden, was interred in the ground. F3iE-pRooF LADIES' DR)EsS.-Within a very short time two youngladies have been burnt to death, owing to their light muslin dresses catching fire from a lucifer match-one in London, the other at Colchester It ought to be generally known that all ladies'light dresses maybe made fireproof at a mere nominal cost, by steeping them, or the linen or cotton used in malking them, in a dilated solution of chloride of zinc. We have seen the very finest cambric so prepared held in the flame of a candle, and charred to dust, without the least flame; and we have been informed that since Clara Webster, a dancer, was burnt to death, from her clothes catching fire on the stage, the muslin dresses of all the dancers at the best theatres are made fireproof. Our manufacturers should take the hint.-Med ial Times. BRISTOL ELEC1owN &YExNsEs.-From the official statement of Mr. G.

ROI1S' COURT, CHANCERY-LANE. Tmv A SCOTT v. SCOTT. (Before the MASTERB of the ROLLS.} His HoNoUR gave judgment in this case, which came before the Court on an application to set aside a decision of the Chief Clerk upon its merits. It appeared that some time previously to the month of July, 1844, the plaintiff Scott had advanced certain sums of money to a person named Parker, a carrier, in order to assist him in his business. Parker, having claims against the Great Western Railway for what areo known as " overcharges," assigned, by a memorandum of the last-mentioned date, these claims and all other claims he might afterwards have for overcharges to Scott. as part security for the money Scott had advanced him. This memorandum was subsequently carried out by a deed dated October, 1845, by which, however, it was merely covenanted that Scott was to have all overcharges then due, no mention being made of any overcharges to become duo. Parker subsequently became bankrupt, and the question now raised was whether a sum of about 700. for overcharges which had accrued since the deed of Oc. tober, 1845, belonged to the assignees of Parker's estate, or passed to the plaitiff Scott. The chief clerk had decided in Favour of the assignees, and the Court now confirmed that decision. Mir. Palmer, Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Selwyn, Mr. Hardy, and Mr. Pearson appeared in the case. THE ATTORNEY-GENRIRL V. BUSEBY. This was an information filed by the Attorney- General to obtain a scheme for the settlement of certain trust property at Grantham in Lincoinshire. The prooeeds of theproperty in question were at present applied by the keybearer and representatives of the freemen of Grantham in relief of any of their body who might be destitute or in distress, and the corporation of Grantham now sought to have It declared that such property ought not to be distributed solely among the freemen, but generally for the benefit of al the inhabitants of Grantham who might stand inneed of it. The property was known as Curteis's Charity, and had been given by the wiU of the founder in 1495 to relieve the " comxaonalty" of Grantham from the payment of the tax or " benevolence" levied npon them by Henry VIL, and to maintain a chapelry. The tax in question had long since ceased, and the funds been applied for the last 200 or 300 years in relief of the freemen as above described. His lONOlUR held that the Attorney-General, strictly speaking, was entitled to a scheme, although the charity funds, as hitherto appropriated, appeared to the Court to have been anything but ill applied. It was a pity to sea charity property unnecessarily expended in litigation, and if the corporation and the freemen of Grantham could mutually agree upon a scheme, he (the Master of the Rolls) would personally settle it for them, in order, as far as possible, to stem the consnmption of the funds of the charity. The Attorney-General, Mtr. R. Palmer, r. Selwyn, Mr. T. Terrell, Mr. Robson, and Mr. Fischer appeared in the case.
VICECHANCELLORS' COUPTS, JuLY 6. VWHITEHEAD V. BEsNE:rr. (Beforc Vce-Chancelor r R. T. KMDIsLaEY.1 In this cause tho question was whether certain buildings used .or the purposes of trade were of such a nature as that the tenant was entitled to remove them. The premises were situated at Newton, near Manchester, and in the occupation of William Marshall Ireland, who was allowed to go into chambers in the suit as such lessee. Mr. Eddis, Mr. KarslaLe, and Mr. Bazalgette appeared for the several parties. The VICE-CHuNCELLOr. requested to be furnished with further information as to which of the buildings wera new, and how they were erected, and the case stood over for that purpose. WHITIG V. SLATER. This suit was instituted to set aside a certain indenture dated the 18th of January, 1855, as being without consideration. The biU stated that James Slater was during his life indebted to the plaintiffs in 3004, and on the 4th of October, 1S54, made his will and gave his furniture to his wife absolutely, as also a cottage, and the residue of his property to trustees upon certain trusts. The testator died on the 21st of February, 1855, possessed of furniture aud valuable plate, and a policy in the Norwioh Union. A decree was made for the administration of the estate in a suit of " Gardiner v. Slater," that the accounts of the realty and personalty should be taken, and William Slater, son of the testator, carried in an account, not inclading the farniture, and the trustees proved the I.0001. and 8001. as a specialty debt. On the 18th of January, 1855, the deed in question was executed, made between the testator, of the first part; Lot Gardiner and Peter Leigh, of the second part; and the testator's wife, ot the third part, reciting the will of one Bolton, under which Mrs. Slater was entitled to 3,0001. for life for her separate use. Of that will Gardiner and Leigh were surviving trustees; and further reciting that by indenture dated the 13th of September, 1854, Urs. SIster assigned her interest in the 3,0001., under the will of Bolton, to secure the advance of 1,0001, made by Gardiner and Leigh to William Slater and ,obert Slater (sons of the testator); and also reciting that by indenture of even date Mrs. Sister had assigned to the same parties the same amount to secure 8001. advanced to her hu;band, James Slater; and that in order to cover the liability thus thrown upon Mrs. SLater, in cnnsideration of natural love and affection, James Slater agreed to make the assignment thereinafter contained, and did assign the policy to Gardiner and Leigh, upon trust, to receive and invest, and pay the income to Mrs. Slater for life, with remainder to William Slater and Robert Slater, as tenants in common, and the furniture on similar trusts. The bill charged that the recitals in the deed were Incorrect and false, that there was no consideration for the assignment, that it was void as against the creditors of James Slater, and might be delivered up to be carncelled. Mr. Glasse and Mlr. Miller appeared for the plaintiffs; Mr. Baily and Mr. Karslake for the widow and sons of the testator; Mr. S wanston and Mr. De Gex for the trustec. I Mr. GLASSE was heard in reply. At the conclusion of the arguments, The VICE-CHANCELLOR reserved his judgment. (Beforc ricc- Cancdllor Sir J. STUART.) HOLE V. BARLOW. This was a motion for an injunction to restrain the defendantfrom burning or causing to be burnt any bricks on his lands opposite to rirunswick-road, Higheate, so as to occasion damage or annoyazne to the plaintiff as owner of two houses in that road. Pritr to May last the plaintiff was and he is now the leasehold ownei and the occupierof No. 53, Brunswick-road, where he carries on the business of abuilder, sand he is also the leasehold owner of another house in Brunswick-road, which is let on lease to a tenant. The biU alleged that the defendant, about the 22d of May, commenced the construction of two bricknils on land in his possession, immediately opposite to the fiont windows and entrances of the two before-nmentioned houses belonging to the plaintiff; that the plaintiff first discovered suoh proceedines of the defendant within averyfew days prior to the 22d of Mlay; that the two kilns had since been completed; and that since such completion the defendant had burnt bricks in them, and that he had thereby committed a nuisance, to the injury and annoyance of the plaintiff. It appeared that one of such kiluns was within 74 feet of the front wall of the house occupied by the plaintifi and that such kiln and the plaintiff's house were separated only by the intervening public road. The defendant's case was that the land in which he was making bricks had been used as a brickfleld for many years past, and long before the plaintiff came into the localitv,-which was in the year 1855, -or either of his houses was erected; thatwhen the plaintiffoame to reside in the Brunswick-road there was a heap of clay on the defendant's land which the plaintiff must have seen, and which, if he had inquired, he might have ascertained was iutended to be conwrted into bricks; that the defendant commenced operations on his land on the 30th of Januarv last: that betveen that time and the 22d of Mlay the plaintiff wasfreque;tly told by tbe defendant and his workmen that it was their intenltion to convert tle clay then on the land into bricks, and that the plaintiff himself, immediatelv in the rear of several houses iin the Brunswickl road, includin his own tvo houses, burnt clay into ballast for the construction of roads. There was considerable conflict on the evidence with referenco to the annoyauce and injurious effects resulting from the acts complained of in the bill, the evldence for the plaintiff being to the effect that several persons had left the neighbouirhood from the annoyance and injury to their health resulting from the burning of bricks on the defendant's land, while the evidence for the defendant went to show tbat the bnrning of bricks was a healthv occupation, that persons engaged in it generally enjoy good health and attain to old age, and that persons who knew of the brickburning on the defendant's land were anxions to go and reside in the Brunswick-road for the benefit of their health. Mr. Bscon and lMr. Rogers were for the plaintiff; Mr. Malins and Mr. Speed for the defendant. The VIcE-CAsNcELs.no said, that he did not feel justified in the present state of the case in granting the iinuction. Prior to 1853 bricks had been burnt on the land belonging to the defendant, and when the plaintiff went into the neighbourhood in 1855 there was a mound of brick earth there which it was sworn he must have seen. That was not all, for the plaintiff himself, in the rear of the houses in the Brunswick-road, had been burning clav into ballast for soadmaling. The plaintiff also had not shown that diligence in oeeking the interference of this Cour' which he ought to have done. Under these ircumstnoes the motion mout stand over with liberty to the plaintiff to take such proceedings at law as he might be advised. I _____________
COURT OF QUEEN'S BBNCH, GurLDHALL. JULY a. THE QUEEN V. COCKBUUK AND ANOTHERF. II rng as aZM ertus, before Lord CAMPBELL and a i Specia Jurv)h ktr. Lcdwin James, QC,Mr. Bodkin, and Mr. Tumrne appeared for the prosecution ; Mr. Horry and Mr. Gent appeared for the defendant Cockbura ; and Mr. D. Seymour for thd other defendant, 'W. J. Lawson. M1r. TuRNEEt, the junior counsel for the proseotttion, statedl that this waz au indlictmaent which charged the defendants, William Cockbnra aud. William John L-awson, with conspiring to damage the credit of the Bank of London, by the publication of a series of libels in the Joint-tockCompasnirs Journ'acl. Mr. JAMES,, in opening the case, said the present prose. cntion was instituted by the directors of the Bank of Londoni, and the indictment charged the defendants, Cockburn and Lawson, with a conspiracy to injure the credit of the Bank of London, and with the object, as would appear in the course of the trial, to extort money from the directors The Bank of London was established in 1855, with Sir John Shelley, the member for Westminster, as the chairnan ; an4l it would appear that Lawson had made a claimn upon the ban-k in respect of some abortive scheme wvhich ha had fornied for the establishment of a bank with the same name. Ho had also brought an action against the company for pirating the name of the "1Bank of London," but the Couat had decided, upon demurrer, that he (Lawson) had no claim upon the banak, anad that the action would not Jie. It would be shown that the two defendants, Cockburn and Lawson, bad joined in carrying onL together a paper called the JTotnt-Stock. Com antoic Journal, in whiich the libels now ompaine ofhadbeen published. One of these articles was contained in a number dated the 18th of April, 1.857. It would be shown that the journal in question was entered at Stationers'-ball as published by "1John Mluir, jun., Bouverie.stieet," a youDg man who bad given no authority for the use of his name; and the mame of the proprietor was stated to be "1Guilleaume Celebrant, of 35, Clarendon. street, London," which would be shown to be a disguised representation of "1William Cockburn," the defendant, who lived in Clarendon-street. It would be shown that the defendant Cook-bumn had made applications to the Bank of London to have their advertisements inserted in his paper; and on some occasions the advertissing agents, to whom this matter was left, had given him advertisements, but subsequently this was discontinued. In consequence of this refusal the article of the 18th of April was published;and boys were hired to go about the streets wi;th placards to promote its sale. The boys were told to walk up and down the streets, and if they could not sell them they were instructed to go into the banking houses andl give them away. The boy was arrested and takcen before the Lord Mayor, and when inquiries and searches were made it was disaovered that the proof of the article of the 18th of April contained corrections in the handwriting of thedefendant Lawson. It would appear that an article was published in the Atas of then1th of April in rhich some commaents were made on the Bank- of London, but the .Atlas had in a subsequent number with. drawn the imputation. The article, as it appeared in the Atlas on the 18th of April, was as follows "Taz lBa~x or LoteDoxr.

On one occaion, when Iotentioned Lawson's name, Cockburn said, "Hush,Idon't want the boys to knowr the name of that writ of thi. journal." I asked him what I should call Mr. Lawson?

In April this year I had been from 9 to 12 months in his service. He employed me to deliver papers at the banks and public offices in London. He had an office at No. 224, Strand. I know Lawson. I was in the habit of tat-kin papers backwards and forwards from Lawson to Cockbnrn, and from Cockburn to Lawson. I used to see Lawson at the City of London IUnion office in st. 3Mary-axe.

COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. JULY 6. BAYLIS V. THE UITY GENZRiL ASSTTRA,VrV Anl(OTAMInl I SAM V. TIE UN FIASSURACE ASSOIAITION- [tKxnam at Guisdha before the Lord Chief Justice CocK- BURN and a Sz;wial Ju2wiL AuDM swo causes, which involved the same facts and uestiOng, were on Fniday last, after the trial of the first Ead proceeded to some length, referred to the learned Judge to decide what should be done, as was stated in our i3mpression of Saturday. This morning the LORD CnE JXucE gave his decision. I think (said his Lordship) that the plaintiff has taken too partial a view of what passed, and that the account given hyMr. Jackson is substantially correct. The ction has been prematurely brought. The plaintiff is entitled to a year's salary from thel9th of Februarylast, but he is bound to render services when required. To a certain extent in the preparation of accounts he did render his services to the fire office. By the life company he was not called upon to render any. lie is, then, enttledto his year's salary from the fireoffice conditionally onhis performingservices if required. At the expiration of six months from the 19th of February he wiL be entitled to his first half-year's salary, and to the rest of the salary as it becomes due. With respect to the life office the same principle must be applied. With respect to costs, the plaintiff having brought the action prematurely, he is not entitled to recover costs. On the other hand, the company are not entitled to them, because if they had dealt cansdidly withthe plaintiff and explained to hin his position the action would not have been brought. Both parties being in the wrong I think that each should pay their own costs. In the event of any dispute as to servces to be rendered, I reserve to myself the right of deciding betwveen the parties. CARTER V. CLMIENT. Mr. F. Russell and MIr. Hake appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Knowles, Q.C., and Mr. C. Clark for the defendant. The action was for hbel. Defendant pleaded "Not Guilty," and a justification that the alleged libel was true. The plaintiff was, in February last, the superintendent of the nursery in the Sarylebone Workhousse. The defendant is publisher of the Ob8ereers newspaper. The plaintiff, on entering upon her situation found the ward was in an unusuaDly defective state as 'to the supply of stores. It vas necessary to have a few stores as a reserve ready for children who suddenly came in. as she could not obtain a supply of fresh stores except on certain days. The -ward had been unhealthy, and plaintiff, as well as others residing there, suffered in consequence. One of the night nurses, having been out all day, returned drunk, and was discharged by the plaintif. The discharged nurse, in revenge charged t the plaintiff beoe the Board of guardians with stealing the stores. An investigation and search were made by the guardians, in allusion to which the followrin pasrmraoh appeared in the defendant's neigpapar of the profearn tof b us tyear:- 4zDsssscruL P LxrBOF PoARCxssousS. : n hA *hOn m iday, at the mreedb ing of thehe wr eboe Board of Guardiank, awisoery boutbf ore the motst corutetrandushmees apeie one ortobber house, and that:on ash Wedne3aaysheyobiaineds permissios So go out them, attached to the infants' department. imagining that they had beenexpowed by the chief nurs of the ward. who is paid, in retaliation, end to revenge themselve, made a revelation againt the chtef nurEe in question that sie was In the habit of robbmg the poor helpless chit dren of their food, which she seceted and conmed away by stealth from the workhouse as occaion offered.

Ribs of beef, mutton cbops. mstera pouends of sugar, rice, arrowrt, port wine, ale, beer, and evenr desedption of stores were found secrted, and even milk, in larg quantinies was made away with, and thae pan flled up with water. Therer bad been a earful mortality in two particula ward for some time Dast; and it was last week shat four pod r little creatures died, and the cause of their death faled the medicalmen, whonhave from time to time attributed the ickrly saine of the children to want of properTentllatlon.

Mr. KNowLEs addressed the jury for the defendant, and, after observing that the defendant had nothing to do with the conduct or condition of the workhouse, pointed out that the paragraph in the newspaper showed that the charges against the plaintiff were made by nurses who had been accused of drunkenness. Mforeover, ina subsequent number of the newspaper the charge was withd Ira n Here the learned JUDGt observed that the defendant today by his plea of jdsifiration re-asserted the charge. A conversation hereuponi ensued between the counsel of the parties, after which Mr. KNo'wLms announced that an arrangement had been come to. The defendant would withdraw the plea of justification, and consent toa verdict for the plaintif for 25f a Myr. RUSSELL, for the plaintiff, said that the only object Of the nlaintiff was to vindicate her character. The 'LORD CHIEF JUSTIaM-The termination of the cause is bonoui-able to both parties. The defendants have acted fairly as journalists, andl the plaintifft in accepting the damaes offered her, I think, has shown great moderation. Th jury then found a6 verdict for the plaintiff-damages, 251.
I COURT OF EXCHEOUER. MAtnrAV .T-rnv l OIittngs at Nizi Priws, at Guildhal4 before the C r IDBAROIT and Sneial JTr2ilpq I Upon his Lordship taking his seat this morning a special juror complained that he had been obliged to attend, although the record in the case on which he had been summoned had been withdrawn. The CTITF BARON said, he was sorry he had no power to compel attorneys to give notice if they had no intention to ceme to trial. It was very inconvenient to the special Jurors and vlry disrespectful So the Court. He could not say that it amounted to contempt* if it did he should know what to do. nANDS V. THE NEWPORT, ABERGAVENNY, AND HP.REFORD RAILWAY COMPANY. MIr. Bovili and Mr. Hawkins appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Mellor for the company. The plendings having been opened, Mr. BOVILL uid, in this action, the plaintiff, Mrs. Lucy Ann Hands, was the widow of Mr. Edmund Henry Hands, who, being a passeger from Hererord to Newport, was Inlled by a collision on the defendants railway. The company, not disputing their liability, had agreed to give the plaintiff 2,000., half for herself and half for her children. A verdict was tken for the plaintiff,-Damages 2,000. I,COOI. for the widowv, and 1,00W. to be divided equally amor,g the children. His Lonnsm? certified for the special jury. BREACn OF PROMISE OP MAERIAGE. THATCHER V. D'AGUThAR. Thespecial jury having beensworn in this case, Mr. PT=CF. applied to have it stand over for a short time. The brief which had been delivered to the leading counsel was returned, in eonsequence of the learned entleman being unable to attend toit. No time had beenl sbin banding the brief to another oounsel, but no one senior to himself was present for the plaintiff. Mr. II CHmXzRS, who appeared vith Mr. Lush for the defendant, said there was very good reason for coznsel not beingbere. The CHIF BARoN.-You must either go on, Mr. Prentice, or withdraw the record. Mx. PREsTIC-I cannot withdraw the record. Mlr. CH}AMBnRs asked that the witnesses should be ordered out of court. The witnesses having withdrawn, Mr. PRENTICE said-Aim Cotton Thatcher is the plain tiff, and Henry D'Aguilaris the defendant. This is an acon for breach of promise of marriage. The detendant has pleaded, first, that he did not make the promise, and, secondly, that the plaintiff wholly absolved, exonerated, and discharged the defendant from his promise. I regret, gentlemen, that in the absence of my learned friend who waswith me Ihave unexpectedlyto open this case to you, but I think you will find it is one *ell deserving your serious consideration. Mrs. Thatcher, theplaintiff, is the widow of amedical man who was for some years in the East India Company's service. Her father, AJaptain Ross, held a very high office under the Government int China. One of her sisters married Mr. Lloyd, and another the late M ajor Seaton. The defendant is a Colonel l the army, aud his father was formerly Governor of Hongkong, Iu this way the families had been somewhat known to each other. The pecuniary eircumEtances of these persons are very different, the defendant being ver rich;e but with regard to their position in society there is very Hlttle, if any, diference between them. hMr Thatcher has three ehildren, andl wAs residling at BrightouL in the year 185, when she first met with the defendant under thesoe crcumstacs. I dare say some of youL who know Brighton know that the band plays in Regency-square. It seems that Mrs. Thatcher was in the habit of going to hear the band play, and there she saw Colonel D'Aguiar, who noticed her by taking off ishat. Knowingverywewh he was, o believig theyhd mnet in society, and knowing how the families had been coanected at Hongkong, Mtrs. Thatcher was not surprised, and bowed in return. -She met him on sever alccasions rtke this before he spoke to her. He did speak to her. She knew well who he wan, and she believed he knLew who ahe -was. After thus being introduced, he called on her at the house where she was residing with her children, and sent up his card. Whether struck by her manuners or by her personal appearance le called on many occasions The courtship went on for some little time, and he promised to marry her. Perhape I should say at once that I do not pretend to show what were the exact words of that promise to mary. I believe I shall show that he acknowledged he courted and intended to marry her. 'Upon one occasion he presented his portrait, which wiU be produced before you. Upon another occasion he gave a lock of his hair, and he showed those attentions which I believethough I know very little myself about these mattersare usaul when persons are engaged. This went on for some time, andon one occasion yon will find that the defendant asked one of the daughters, who will be called before you, how she would like him for her papa. Such conversations will be detailed as will leave very little doubt that at one period it was the intention of the defendant to marry this lady. He was in the habit of making her handsome presents. He made her a present of a very beautiful rin and he wa frequently in the habit of writing to her. This is one difficulty which I have in the case. I am not in a position to lay before you those letters. Colonel D'Aguilar induced her to return them, and we have subponaed him to produce them. The CrEF BAROI,.-He cannot be a witness. You cannot subpena him at all You can.only givo notice to produce. Mr. Pn TIcZ.-That is what we have done. The CHEF BAnoN.-I doubted whether I correctly remembered the statute. You should not say that you have subpcunaed him. Mr. P?RENTICE.-NO, my lord. We have, however, given notice to the other side to produce those letters. This is one of the few forms of action in which neither theo laintiffnor the defendant can be'called to give evidence before you, and all the letters are in the possession of the defendant. It seems that unfortunately confiding in the position inshich she was placed, andbelievingin thepromiseof mar-. riage, the plaintiff hashad achild, of which, nodoubt, Colonel D'Aguilar is the father. He did make some payments of money in the first instance, but not continuing them he was summoned 'oefore the magistrates and compelled to support the child. There were also proceedings in the County Court, and a verdict passed agatnst him there also. The only ,uestionin this case is whether or not any promise of marriage was made on the part of the defendant, and I think when I have laid before you the evidence which I am in a position to adduce you wiiU answer that question in the affirmative. Being unexpectedly called on to address you I shall be excused for not detailing the evidence minutely, but I must remind you, in conclusion, that the case is one of most serious importance to the plaintiff. The first witness caUled was- Miss Annie Jane Breddon Thatcher, who said,-I am the daughter of Mi. Thatcher, the plaintiff in this action. She is the widowof Mr. Thatcher, who was a medical officer in the East India Company's service. I am now at school, I am 14 years of age. In 1853 I was living with my mo. ther, sster, and brother, In Montpelier-street, Brighton. We occnpied a house there. I know Colonel D'Aguilar. I remember his coming to the house at Brighton. I had not known him before. He frequently came to the house-nearly every day. I remember on one occasion my mamma brought myself and my brother into the room where the Colonel was, and said, " Colonel D'Agullar is to be your future papa." He did not say anything. I do not temember what he did. My sister was present, and he went up to her and kissed her. I do not remember how many years ago this took place. It was while we were living in Montpeler-street. The Colonel came quite as frequently as before. He brought presenits. He ave arngand several boeuqets of hothouse flowers. I fave st the prtrait produced. It is the portrait of ColonelD'uiar. Idonot reomember when it wasbrought to the house. I remember when it was hung up. It was after he kissed my sister. I do not know how long. I have never seen the lock of hair produced until now. I do not remember any hair having been given to my mamma. I believe my mamlma used to teach Colonel d'Aguilar to play the piano. She received letters from him. She took myself, sister, and brother to church every Sunday. Colonel d'Agilar was very kind to me. Cross-examined by Mr. M. CHm&armS.-I was at home, not at school. I do not recollect how many months I was absent from school about that time. I was absent nearly a whole year. I did go to a day school at Brighton. I. went to a day school during the whole time I waw at Montpelierstreet. There was another gentlemnan who came to see my mamma. I think it was in 1853 he used to come. I do not remember how long before 1853 that otber gentleman used to come. It was Mr. Granvllle. Mr. Granville was a great friend of my mamma's. During part of the time that Colonel D'ilarused to come Mr. Granville also used to come. They never met. I think 3tr. Granville used to eome in the evening aftet Colonel D'Agailar had gone away, and he used to stay after I went to bed. On one occasion dr. Granville stayed all night. I de not knowwhether Mr. Granville lived at Brighton. I have not talked with mamma about him. I do not know that he was an engineer on the Brighton Railway. He gave us cakes and brought mamoma flowers. I never saw his portrait. Hehasbeen intimate since 1853. He used to comge tOto see my mnmama at Hookworth after we left A juror said, a voice had more than once been directed to the witness. Mrs. Thatcher was designated as the person. The CHIEF BA RoN said, the jury complain that you have more than once spoken to your daughter while she is giving her evidence - you had better leave the Court. Mrs. Thatcber withdrew. Examination resumed.-I waswithmy mamma at Chelsea part of the time. That was before we went to Brighton. Mr. Firth, a cousin of my mother's came to Chelsea. Mamma told me he was her cousin. He used to come late and sleep there. I do not know what he was, but I think he lived at Chelsea. Mr. Firth came one night when we were in London. The CH BARoN.-Have you any uncles or aunts? Witness.-I have two aunts, one named Seaton and the other Lloyd. I know no other relations named Firth. I think it is more than three years since my mamma left Brighton. I wentwith her to Ditchling. Thero was a little baby born when we were at Preston, near Brighton. I was away at school. The a R BAoI.-How old was the baby when you saw it?7 Witnes.-It was a lttle thing In long clothes. WVe havo been in London sice, leaving Brighton. I was with mamma in Brompton-squate. One or two gentlemen used to come there. They were not cousins. There were not as many as five or six. When they came we were allowed to remain. They did not sleep there. They used to come sometimes in the morning and sometimes in the evening. I was not with mamma at Albany-street. I was with her at Gravesend, at two lodgings. Mamma lodged with Miss Husband at Northfleet. I was not present when the landlady told her she was to leave. I was at school. Mamma has not told me that she was turned out of the lodgings. Mr. Firth used to give my mamma plants. I know Mr. Griffiths. He was a great friend of mamma's. I never heard mamma say he was ner lover. Mr. Griffiths used to come at Ditchling. He kissed me. Colonel D'Agfilar kissed my elder sister. My brother is the youngest. He is nine years old. We met Mr. Griffiths at Brighton first. I do not recollect whether when we first saw him he was walUing on the es-lanade smoking a cigar. He came up and spoke to mamma He seemed to be a stranger. He came home with us the same evening. Ithink that wasthree.yearsago. He did not stay until after we had gone to bed. I did not hear my mamma tell the landlady at Ditchling to make up a bed for him, and the landlady refuse. At Ditchling mamma told me he was a very good friend to her. I de not think Colonei D'Agnlar ever came to see mamma after the month of y, 1853. It was not very long before that when he kissed my sister, and mamma said he was to be our papa. The first time Colonel D'Aguilar came wechldren did not see him Mamma told us it was Colonel D'Aguilar. I had not spoken to him until I was taken in to see him. The portrait used to hang in the bedroom over the washhandstand. I do not know whether Mr. Granville saw it. Inever heard him make any remark about it. Some one, this morning, pointed out Colonel D'Agnilar in the ball. It was my mamma. She said, "j Mind and recolleet that is the Colonel." To the CHmE BAnoN.-It was a long time ago since I saw him, and I had forgotten him. Cross.examination continned.-I saw him more than twiico in Montpelier.street. To the CaF3 B3uoT.-Mnamma asked me if I remembered Colonel D'Aguilar, and I said "No." I think that was why she pointed him out to me. Cross-examiation continued.-She said, "That is the gentleman who used to come to see me so often." She did not remind me that he was the gentleman who kissed my eler sister. The Cnmar BARON.-Eave you any objection to a juror being withdrawn, Mr. Chambers ? Mr. CHAanDRs.-No, my lord, if it is done in both causes. There is another cause in trover to recover the letters. Mr. PRMNmIc&-I should lIketo receive instructions before consenting, my lord. After the case of " Swinfen v. Swinfen" counsel have very little authority. The Cimz BARLON.-I think you have abundance of authorty. Something is due to the public time, and something to te public morals. Mfr. Pnxicx.W-ilU you call the plaintiff, Usher7 The CHIEF BARON~.-No. Go out and speak to her. MIr. PxxNvrCX.-She is entitled to come into court, my lord. The Cmxv BARcON.-I think it better that she should not come into cout -Perhaps you wiU have no objection to go to her Z Mr. PnRENcsMc-Doe your Lordship think I have autho- Se Ct? BA1oSz.-I have no doubt whatever. Itis not the case of an arrangement as to anything which is tobe done anywhere else. As to what is to be done here in this court, I am quite crtain you have abundant authority to take any course which you may think best. Mr. PrsNTIcM-I wil act upon your Lordship's suggestion and withdraw a juror if your Lordship thi,is, that is the prop r course. The C=F BARoN.4I think so, considsring what has gradually oozed out, andiwhat has taken place this morning. Mr. CERSLnn9.-On thewholerecord? There a two cause of action on the sime record-the breah of promise and the trover. I 3Mr. PIcxMM-Yes, I withdraw a juror on the whole reoord, 4 juror was then withdrawn, and the case thus snddenly termiated. LE PAGE V. TEE= LON-ON AND :?zzAXcz px Mu CODIPAN1. Mrr. B3ovil and Mr. Qusin 1 were counsei for thea plaintiff Mr. LuBsh and Mr. Raymond appead for the defendatg. The action was brought to recover compensation for low sastained by the plaintiff in consequence of the bad packing of a number of marble articles which were purchaeWd by him of the company and forwarded by them to him In Calcutta. The plaintiff is a general trader to India, and early in 1853 bought a large quantity of marble goods, such as statuettes,columns, tazzas, vases,and txbles,of the Serpen. tine Company. The goods were packed by a professional packer in 22 cascs, 20 of which were sent by sea, and two of which were taken by the plaintiff by the Overland route. Upon his reaching Calcutta he found the two mases to be so completely smashed as to be entirely worthless- indeed, ono was so bad that plaintiff did not pay the duty, but left it at tho Custom-house. le immediately wrote a letter of complaint, and the company sent out duplicate articles to replace those in the two cases- but 'when the 20 other cases arrived, and with the exception of two or three, wero found in the same frgmentary condition, and when the plaintiff came to England and demanded further compensat[on, the company demurred and denied The ClE?P BARON left threo questions to the jury. L Were the company responsible for the packing? 2. Was amount of damtages ought thPe °plantff torecipovper? ha TChe juryrfon a verdict for the plaintiff-d.amsges 1C0L CARPErNTER V. WRIGMT. Mr. FnILD, for the plaintiff said, this action was bronght for an assult and also for slander, the defenidant havint said that he knewn a thing of the plaintiff forwhich he c be trans orted. He was hapgp to say the jury would not be troubae{d, as Mr. Carpenter had instituted these proceed. ings not to put money in his pocket, bat to vindicate his character, and the defendant now agreed to withdraw the imputation and to miake an apology. Mr. Carpenter was v manufacturer in Birmingham, and Mr. Wright was an accountant in the same town. Upon some occasion, having spent the day and part of the evening together Mr. Wright became excited andangry, strack Ir. Carpenter and used the langaage for which he was now ready to say there was no foundation. Mr. HUDDLESTON, for the defendant, said, M1r. Wright was a gentleman of great respectability, but being excited by some conversation which had sed he certainly did forget what was due to himself. For many years the plain tiff and defendant had beenmutual friends, and this was the first time anything had occurred to interrupt that friendship Mr. Wright expressed his regret for what he had said, retracted the words he had used, and disavowed the accusation he was alegedto have made. It was to behoned that the friendrhip of the Darties would be restored by this termination to their litigation. A juror was then withdrawn. SECOND COURT. (Sitings at 2iSi Prius, at Guildhall, before Mr. Baron MARTIN and a Common Jury.) HASKELL V. TvIUTT. Thi was an action for falso imprisonment. The defendant pleaded "Not Guilty." The facts were that the plaintiff, who was an agent of, or, as ho expressed it, the representative of the Protestant Reformation Society, had gone to Croydon in the latter part of last October for the purpose of attending a meeting, " of visiting the nobility and gentry," and pushing the sale of the society's publications. On the day of his arrival at Croydon he visited an old friend named Hamilton, by trade a tailor, by whom he was invited to partake of a cup of tea, and was also introduced the same evenin to a Mr. Chilcot, with whom the tailor had entered into partnership, as was advertised to the world by bills in his shop window, in the calling of an auctioneer, The one partner had afforded the hospitality of his board, the other offered that of his bed, which was accepted, and on the following day Chilcot borrowed a small sum of money of his guest; but, in order that he might not for an instant be put to any inconvenience by the trifling accommodation, he placed in the plaintiff's hand a checl, signed " Hamilton and Chilcot," for lO., requesting that he would get it cashed for him, when he might reSain thefew shil lingshehad lentandpay himthebalauce. Chilcotmentioned 31r. Tebbutt, the landlord of the Fox and Hounds, as likely to cash the check, since he had once before obliged him In a simiar way. The plaintiff accordingly took the check to the Fox and Hounds, and Mr. Tebbntt gave him the aoney for it. The same day Hamilton and Chilcot left Croydon, and it turued out that the check was utterly worthless, and that not only the defendant, but several other persons, had been taken in by similar instruments. The plaintiff had paid over the balance to Chilcot, and, after transacting his business atCroydon, returnedto London. A little more than a fortnight after the transaction of the check, as the plaintiff, aompanied by Hamilton, who at that time was living with him, were walking alon th street, they were accosted by a police-constable ad informed that they were "wantd." The defendant was with the policeman, and identified the plaintiffas the person who had brought the check, and the other as being con cerned in it. They'were arrested and taken down to Croydon, charged with obtaining money nnder false pretences, the charge-sheet being signed by the defendant The plaintiffwas taken before a magistrat and after being re manded once was discharged. For the defendant, the police ceonstable who made the arrest, and the inspector who took the charge, were called; and it appeared by their evidence that the defendant had been passive throughout, that tho defendant had been taken along with the constable by whom the plalntiffwas arrested merely for the purpose of identify. ing the parties, and that the charge-sheet was signed by him through a mistake, and in compliance with the request of the inspector, while the sergeant, by whose direction it was in fact that the charge was made, was absent for a few minutes. The plaintiff's evidence was also contradicted in several particulars. His LoRDSIP left it to the jury to say whether the defendant had taken any part in the arrest and imprisonment, and they returned a verdict for the defendant. Mr. C. Pollock and Mr. Holl 'were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Seoreant Ballantine aud lr. Robinson appeared for the defendant.
PREROGAT COURT. Mn'wMA& .TM-. d ALIORD V. AL;oMn- (Before Sir JO0n3 DonSONi' - - - I nia was a question whether admiinistration should be granted t the brother of the deceased or tO the committee of his widow, a lunatic. The deceased had himself comratted suicde hile in an unsound sthte of mind. The COuRT granted the administration to the committee BnrACnBRU V. VAUGHIN.-DO31jCUM The testator in this case, Mr. John Edward Blackburn, aretired clerk in the Foreign-office, was born in London on the 15th of Angust, 1817, and he died on the 27th of May, 1855, at lNo. 24, Rue de Bern, Paris possessed of an English freehold estate of the annual value of 780l.; and per. sonal property to the amount of 8,0001. or 9,0001. In November, 1851, he retired on account of ill health from the Foreign-office, and went to live in Paris, with occasional visits to Aix-la-Chapelle and other foreign wateringplaces. In 1844 he bad privately married a French lady named Rousselle, in England; but in 1854, having doubts as to the valdity of that marriage, he repeated the ceremony in a more formal manner in France. Previous to that the parties executed a contract, which he signed as " J. Edward Blackburn, 11, South Audley-street, Londres." He also signed a lease in the same manner. He left a will in the English form, in which he bequeathed to his wife nearly the whole of his personal estate. The QuEM SADVOCATE,in support of the will, contended that the deceased had nevermamnfested the slightest animus Zin end! pteriam. He was a confirmed valetudinarian, and he had for many years been in the habit of going abroad for the sake of his health ; indeed, it was quite clear that his foreign travelling had reference solely to the orders of his physicians. A month before he died he actually would have rturned to England for the purpose of obtaining a commission in the Militia, had it not been for the peremptory prohibition of his medical attendant. In a word, he was, as the French physician said, a "real Englishman" " patriot, aid loved his country." Dr. PHUrL.moRE, on the same side, urged the fact that the deceased had been advised to make his will in the French form, and that he positively refused. Dr. JENimp, contra, sald tho probability was that when the deceased left the Foreign-office he intended to convert his occasional visits to a warmer climate into a permanent stay; and, if so, it would be necessary, in order to re-estab. lish his English domicile, to show that he had given up his animus manendt both in intention and in fact. It had not, however, been proved that he had done so. The Court reserved its judgment.

It was alnost fraudulent thus to contract debts when in such a state of insolvency. Had the assignees opposed, the certificate (second class) would have been suspended 12 months.

SECOND EDITION. TUR TIM.ggOFI-OB^, !teueday Monzin5. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris ourraspondent, dated yestrdsAy (M£onday), 6 p.m..- The -electors attended in considerable number3 this day'at the varios seotios in the three arrondissements to depesit their voting tiekets. It was evideert that the voters, whether among the bourgeoisic or the working dasses, cherished to the last theirr suspicions -of the authorities, and, to prevent as 'much as posible -l tampering with the urns, waited for the ast dgy to proceed to the vote. Be"tween the aspect presented tc-day and yesterday, and the two days of the first elections, now a fort'might ago, there -was little difference except in the 'increased ardou4r of both parties to prevail in this last trial. The Government has certainly allowed a latittide to the elections in the capital which, it appears, was not permitted in the provincems Up to 3 o'clock this afternoonthe movement in the -mzairies continued as marked as in the early part of the day. The voting closed at half-past 4, and the 'operation of counting commenced. As the result -will be known -in the course of the evening I do not venture on any conjecture further than to remark that if those who voted for M. GamierPagis and M. Bastide on the last occasion when the Demooratic party was divided have now voted for M. OUivier and M. Darimnon, those candidates will be elected. The slightest dissension, however, betwees'their supporters will clearly be for the advantage of the Govemnment nominees. As the contest draws to a close in the third district opiniona vary-iot capita tot msenus. It is noticed as singular that the partisn of Generai Cavaignac on one side, and those of M. Thibaut, the official candidate, on the other, seem equally to doubt the success of their men. The fair inference is, that the votes are pretty nearly balanced. General Cavaignac throughout accepted the contest with hesitation, and perhaps solely -oat of deference to others. lIe has not continued it with the earnestness or the vigour of -one who desires to win. He has not taken the initiative; he has slowly followed, and net led; and he has dawdled between the desire of being at the head of the poll and unwiUingness to make any effort to place himself there. He antiicipates some annoyances from refusing to take the oath to the Constitution, if elected; and he is so unwilling to encounter them that, though he would doubtless be gratified to beat the Government, yet I suspect he would be better pleased to be left altogether tohis tranquillity. It is believed that M. Darimon and M. Oliivier, if named, will take the oaths to the Constitution. A private letter from Genoa of the 3d inst. states as follows:- " A despatch has been received from Sapri, a district of 'tho valley of -the province of Salerne. It was sent hither by tho leader of the insurgent party, who liberated the prisoners of -Ponza, and landed in Sapri, where he esta. blished himself. Word was sent to Naples, as previously concerted, and the Neapolitan Govermnuent being informed of what took place, sent two steam frigates io capture the Sardinian steamer the Cagliari, which did not return to Genoa. The 80,000f. belonging to capitalists who had sent that sum from Sardhiia on board the Cagliari were left untouched. The despatch, in fact, announces al that was expected, and as agreed on between 'the insurgents and the Neapolitans. The Government, by sending off-troops, has weakened the garrlsons of Naples, and hasthusgi'en au opportunityto the Neapolitans to rise. We are in the greatest anxiety, waiting to see the terrmi;nation of an affair which has so well commenced. A despatch has beon received here from the Neapolitan Government, addressed to the Consul, demaadinginformation as to when and under what circrumstncos the Cagliari left. ' Here; (at Genoa) the ahair was began proeuaturely; now all is tranquil, and, if things go on well at Napes, the persecutions against the refugees sil probably cinoe to an end; indeed people already begin to 2noiy their Langnage. At Leghorn a rising has taken place, and it was this morning aald that t7 persons had been shot." The present conspiracy was directed, it is said, against the King of Naples and the Pope. It was not with a view to any particular form of government; the object was to get rid of the Italian :Bourbons, and expel the Asstians and those who are protected by them, from Italy, The concoctors of the plan have as their watchworrd the saying of 3laehiavelli, 4cpuoi i Ba&nbarb " m then Italy may choose the government that best suits her. It is said that Al. Mazzini himself has for the preseut abandoned his peculiar notions of government, -has temporarily &bdicated his leadership, and has entered into the cause as a soldier rather than as a chief. What has taken place at Genoa was, it is said, not directed against the Piedmontese Government. The object was to get possession of some ships of war in the harbour, and the occupation of -the forts was judged necessary to 3ceep tle city in check while the vessels were manned by the conspirators. With these vessels it was intended to proceed at once to Naples, and make a desperate attempt to fire the shipping, the arsenal (which is full of combustible material), and the powder magazine, and to blow ,up the Palace and part of the city, if necessary. It eeems that persons employed in the arsenal were aware of what was going on, and, when the moment came, woulld have lent their aid. At Naples itself there was an anderstanding with the conspirators, and in the ranks of the Neapolitan army tLhere are said to be many sympathizers. The conspirators, it seems, are well furnished with money and arms. Sapri, -where they landed, is in the Gulf of Policastro, between the province of Salerno and the northern division of Calabria. It is a mountainous country, -where cavalry can render but little service. A rising was also plarned at Bologna dsring the Pope's stay, but was subsequently abandoned. The chief of the -expedition is an officer of Engineers, who, I believe, formerly served in the French foreign legion; he visited Naples sone short time ago in disguise, and had an opportunity of examining the arsenal with a view to the present outbreak. Information of what occurred at Genoa was given some time since by the French Government to the Cabinet of Turin, and the latter was recommended to take its precautions in time. That this recommnendation was but carelemsly attended to is proved by the condition of the fort of Genoa when attacked. The French Governmentis, it seems, indignant that X Mazzini should be allowed to remain in that city (where, it is affirmed, 'he still is) without being arrested; and the Freach iXtister at Turin has expressed himself verystrongly on the subject. If it abe true, as is alleged, that Mezzini has been lately in Paris, it is hardly possible that his presence was unknown to the French police, and one is tempted to ask, why did not the Freh authoritiee do what the gardinian Government is siow blamed for neglecting.! Accounts have been received to-day that the 4owrners of the steam-packet Cagliari kave demanded -the restoration of that vesse from tlke Neapolitan 4Government on the grounds that the captain and crew)aad acted under the influence of for-ce mejeure. The Xeapolitan Government has replied that the aip is officially confiscated. In case the Sardinian Govenment should support the claims of the owners of the Cagliari it may lead to unpleasant results. It appears from a letter dated Tirin, the 4th inst., that the Fort Diamante, at Genoa, was in possession of the Republcans from 10 o'clock of the night of the 30th of June until daylight of the 1st of July. Eleven eoldiers who formed the garrison after the x..4der of the wergeant were confined in a casemate. The insurgents had ded the guns of the fort, prepasted ehells an(ceno bals, and hAd prepared to de:end ther4selves; but, the conspiracy not having uucccede'A in the towte, they abandoned the fort, leavirg iu it the arms they had brought there. A telegraphic despatch received in Paris gives liews from Naples to the 3d. The insurrection is stated to have been entirely put down on all points. Two engagements' between the insurgents and the Royal troops are stated to have taken place on the frontiers of Calabria, and in the first it is alleged that the insurgents lost 100 men, and in the second 30. The steam frigates of the :Neapolitan navy, Amalia, Roberto, Ruggiero, and Vesuvio, have received orders to cruise on the coast. A private telegraphic despatch from Madrid announces that disturbances had broken out in the south of Spain, but that they have been put down. The authorization for carrying out the law on the press was voted iu the Spanish Chamber of Deputies by a majority of 74 to 21. General Reibell, commanding the sixth military division at Strasburg, who was sent by the Emperor to compliment the Emperor Alexander,iwas received (together with the French Minister at Carlsruhe) on the 5th, at Baden, by the Czar. Trade was quiet last week in Paris. The manufacturers delivered some articles for the fair of Beacaire, and received promises of extensive orders from Russia and the United States. It must be recollected, however, that this is the dead season for several branches of industry. This is the moment, likewise, when the extensive shopkeepers in Paris and the manufacturers in the provinces are occupied in taking stock and arranging their accounts, as they do not expect business to become more active before the month of September. For these reasons the tradesmen of Paris have not as yet had much occasion to take advantage of the reduction of the rate of interest by the 1ank of France. As yet the dockets presented to the Bank for discount have been composed of commercial bills passed for pur. chases of raw silk and wool. We have now some accurate information as to the silk crop. The breeding of the silkworm is concluded in the greater number of the silkworm nurseries, and the result is a half crop in the south of France. Some localities will give even 75 per cent. This calculation is more favourable than the news we received a month since would lead us to expect; but at that moment half the worms as yet reared had been out off by disease. Fortunately, eggs were abundant, and fresh worms were produced, which succeeded better. On the otber hand, the accounts from Lombardy and Piedmont are more satisfactory, but, nevertheless, silk will be dear this year. The cocoons, which have arrived in France in great quantities, are selling from 8f. to 8f. 25c. the kilogramme. In Genoa they are selling at 9f. and 1Of. The crop of silk produced in Europe this year will not be sufficient for the consumption, and we must again have recourse to India and China. A decline in the price of corn and wine is becoming more apparent according as the result of the approaching harvest is better appreciated. The samples of Algerian wheat which have arrived at the Paris markets are magnificent. The farmers are now determined to bring their old wheat to market, and the fall in prices is general throughout the departments. White wheat was sold at the last Paris market at 41f. the weight of 120 kilogrammes, and wheat from Picardy at from 38f. to 38f. 60e. The harvest has commenced in the south of France, and is most productive. The accounts from Italy, and particularly from Naples, are excellent as regards the crops. This good news has produced a considerable effect at Marseilles, where the market shows a further tendency to decline. At the last Paris flour market sales were difficult. Sellers were forced to submit to a reduction of If. and 2f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes for superior quality, and 3f. and 4f. for inferior quality. The best marks were quoted at 73f. 50c. for delivery, and at only 65f. for the three last months of the year. The flour in the reserved market stores amounts to 8,000 metrical quintals. The millers are waiting for the new wheat to come to market before they begin to grind. A decided fall in prices has at length declared itself in the Beroy wine market, as well as in the wine-growing districts. But it is not expected that any serious effect wiU be produeed until the vintage is over, and the quantity and quality of the wine are ascertained. The growers expect large orders for exportation from Russia and the United States in consequence of the reduction of the import duties in those countries. The blossoming of the vine has been impeded by storms in some localities, but in general it took place under excellent conditions. The bunches are well formed, and the grapes themselves are abundant. Spirits of wine distilled from beetroot is quoted at 114f. the hectolitre. The demand is better in consequence of a report that the Prussian Government is about to abolish the bounty granted to the distilers of German alcohols. The following private telegraphic despatch ha, been received:- d MA.RZELES, J'ULY 5. "According to accounts from Constantinople of the 25th ult., a Rvassian steamer, under the English flag, approached the Circassian ports of Gelendjeck and Sou3uk Kale, and sunk several small vessels, after taking out the merchandise which they had on board.

Political combinations offer often curious enough sights inEurope; but they are nothing as compared to misalliances of this kind as they occur daily here. In Europe, in general, but more especially in its constitutional part, there exist more or less accurately defined political sections, which, even if they combine for a particular object, and at a particular moment, separate again as soon as this specific aim is obtained or found impracticable. Hence they are subject to certain laws and admit of a tolerably accurate calculation. In Turkey political parties with a well-defined political creed and a regular system of action do not exist. There is only one article of political creed which is faithfully kept by most of the Turkish statesmen, and which is energetically acted upon, and this is the article to get into place as woon as possible and to remain there the longer the better. You have, indeed, still now and then the names of the old Tarkish and the party of reform mentioned, but they disappear daily more and mora from the official world of Stamboul, which naturally alone can come here into consideration. Progress and reform have become the watchwords of every one who aspires to rale, but if you were to ask for a further explanation of these words you wouldget in most cases very vague answers which woule soon convince you that only an exceedingly small number of Turlish politicians have distinct ideas what reforms are required, and how they are to be effected. It is this vagueness and uncertainty about what is to bedone which have hitherto prevented the formation of political parties, and which, with other causes of a more personal nature, have mainly con. tributed to produce a kind of political isolation, which I would fain cal the state of nature in politics, where every one cares only for himself, but I am afraid to say who cares for alL Nowhere, therefore, can you see the phenomenon of "a fortuitous concurrence of atoms" presented to greater perfection than here; they meet and separate again in more wonderful combinations than any prismatic colour effects ever produce, and the result produced by the union is similar-namely, blank. At the present moment this tendency to a fortuitous concurrence of atoms is again visible. 011 enemies shake each other by the hand, and friends are getting estranged. It would, I am afraid, non mich interest your readers to know how Ahmed grasps the hand of Mehmed, and how this lattec frowns on MIahmoud. The upshot of the whole is that the outs want to come in, and that their manceuvres will force the Grand Vizier to eliminate whatever is heterogeneous in his Cabinet. The struggle in this respect has been going on for some time, and is daily more approaching towards its solution. It is only by clever management that Redschid Pasha has been able to keep together a Cabinet comprising his worst enemies, whom he has been obliged to keep in order to please one side or the other. The Sultan's voyage was expected to bring on the crisis, especially as it was blowing rather fresh in the Sea of Marmora during his tour, but he returned on Wednesday morning, as the innumerable gun salutes announced, andeverything, finances incladed, seems to have, remained in statu quo. However, there are the f4tes of the circumcision remaining to be speculated upon. They were to have begun on Thursday last, but they were deferred till next week. M. Blondeel, the Belgian Minister, who, as you wMill remember, received his passports lately, left on Thursday last for Athens, where he intends to stay until, as he hopes soon, he willbe able to return again to this post. As he is accredited to the Court of Athens too, it would be possible to make his departure look like a visit to his second post, were it not for the official announcement that he has received his passports. The subscriptions for the new National Bank have begun, but as yet only in the circle of Galata, where they seem to be progressing. It is only after a certain number of subscriptions are obtained that the affair will be submitted to the different councils through which all such projects have to pass. The first in the series is the Council of the Tanzimat, but, as a great opposition is apprehended there, the President, Kiprisli Mehemet Pasha, late AmbassadorExtraordinary in Russia, being in deadly opposition to the Ministry, it is thought the Government wilU dispense with it in this case. Thus the affair has t; pass the Grand Council before it can be submitted to the Sultan. So the affair can scarcely be regarded as concluded. Two new railway projects have arisen-one an Austrian, and the other an English one. The first is to start from Brod-on-the-Save, and traverse European Turkey from north to south, ending at Salonica. In fact, it would be running in an almost parallel line with that projected by M.r. Layard. Thisline, asfarasopeningouttheresourcesofTarkey goes, is far inferior to that proposed by Mr. Layard, because the northern half of it would yield comparatively little for exportation, but it would certainly be the most direct line of communication by rail from Europe to the Archipelago. The project is not based on any surveys, but the cost is estimated at 12,000,0001. sterling. A kind of conditional promise has been given by the Turkish Government for the construction of this line-that is, if the parties interestedareableto form a company within four 4nonths, and deposit the usual two per cent. of the ;capital, they will be allowed to construct the line. When the merits of this line were discussed about two months ago at the Tanzimat a curious instance occurred of the sagacity which is sometimes exhibited by common sense in opposition to the most complicated calculations. When the great advantages and facilities of the line were laid before the Council, the President made the simple remark,-How does it occur that Austria has to borrow money from abroad to construct her own railways, and an Austrian company is now offering for us to construct such a long and expensive line ? I have not heard the answer returned to this remark of common sense. The other project is that of a railway from Sivas to Samsoun. In speaking before of railways I have often had occasion to remark that, as a general rule, short lines are moat adapted to Turkey. The whole country, whether you take the European or the Asiatic side, is intersected by considerable mountaia chains, which form geographical, national, and comraercial limits between the different provinces. All, oc almost all, of these provinces have more or less homogeneous productions; theyhave, therefore, very few commercial transactions between themselves, the interest of every one being invariably to bring its own produce to the sea, and thus to Europe. This Is more especially the case with Asia Minor, the interior of which consists of a series of plateaux, every one of which has a more or less easy outlet towards the sea. The railwayFines are thus traced by nature as it were. Sampsoun has been from time immemorial the ddbouche of the plateau of Sivas, and a line of railway is, therefore, strongly indioated there. Mr. Price, who has been entrusted with the negotiations, has been to the spot, and has explored the country. This general rough survey has been satisfactory enough to induce h to apply to the Government for a concesion Of this line. Allthe Wallachian refEgees have at last obtained permission to return to their country. Their return is a tribute not only to justice, but to comnmon aense likewise. The whole spirit of the movement of 1848 in Wallachia was directed, not against Turkey, but aEainst Russia, and the Turkish Government itself acknowledged this by giving civil and military employments to several among the most compro. mised., If they were thought thus trustworthy enough to occupy responsible positions under the TurkifA Government, why then prevent them so long from returning? The Turks have a very good answer for such questions, "Kim biUur ? AUah biitr" (Who knows? God knows.) ITALY. (to icowsr aoDronzsPlDsT.) NAPLES, Just 30. Important despatches arrived from Gaeta in Nsplea on Sunday night at a late hour, by which six vemels were ordered to be itted out immediately. The gfrale wras beaten at 11 o'clock at night in the arsenal. Two vessels left on Monday morning (29th inst.) for Baim, to take in powder and ball, other two left in the afternoon, and two more follow this morning. After taking in their ammunition they 'proceed to Gaeta. No one knows anything of the object or of the destination of the armament; but great alarm prevails, arnd it is conjectured that a revolution has broken out in Sicily and Calabria. SPAIN. (FROMs OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) MADRID, JuLY 2. The conspiracy at Malaga, mentioned yesterday, i comprehended, it appears, 12 or 15 non-commis- sioned offlicers of artillery, and was in a Republican sense. A corporal, named Campelo, has been shot by sentence of court-martial. The insurgent band that showed itself in the Sierra Morena, and which Ileters and papers from the south persist in esti. matingat 70 or 80 men, is said to have consisted of natives of Baylen and La Carolina, and to have distributed democratic proclamations. After robbing one tnail they attacked a second, but the escort, aidedoy some armed civilians from the neighbouring villages, drove them away. They left one man dead on the ground. Since then there is no further news of them. TIhre is a feeling of considerable uneasines's in Madrid, and reports are eurrent tending to show that dissaffection, or a widely-spread conspiracy, exists in various parts of Spain. Carlist movements are also spoken of. It is said that a plot has been discovered at Santona, on the north coast; also that a battalion in garrison at Vittoria has been marched away from that town, on account of symptoms of revolt observed in its ranks; also I that Major Marina, who was marching south- wards at the head of some companies of the Madrid Chasseurs a Pied, was removed from his command at La Carolina by order of the Government, it having been discovered that he was mixed up in a conspiracy. I cannot vouch for the truth of these and of other reports of the kind that are in circulation; but what I can positively state is, that there is a weight in the air of this capital just now, and that people are oppressed by a vague apprehension of coming events. There is a feeling of alarm abroad, although it is impossible to say exactly on what it is founded. The commencement of panic caused in the Prado on Monday by the trifling incident that occarred in the bullring is an indication of this unaccountable uneasiness. People are in that nervous and apprehensive state that a couple of boys running through a crowded thoroughfare would suffice to set the whole street scampering. I confess that I do not see from what quarteranything of the nature of an insurrection is to come, for I know that the Progresista party are quite unprepared to act. At the same time events in Spain sometimes tread on each other's heels with unforeseen rapidity, and we are just at the critical time of the year. The law on the 'press has given rise to much discontent, and the unpopularity of the Palace has, as you have been lately informed, at tained an almost unprecedented height. Recent violations of the rules of the Cortes, committed to please the Government, and the overbearing tone and manner adoptedin the Chambers by some of the Mlinisters (especially by AL Nocedal, against whom there exists a general feeling of detestation) have further irritated the public mind. In connexion with these various circumstances may be mentioned the somewhat vacillating and uncertain attitude of the Narvaez Cabinet, the belief that differences of opinion exist within it, and the certainty that it stands only because the Absolutists, who conolder that it is doing their work for them, abstain from upsetting it. The project of law authorizing the Government to put in force the undiscussed law of the press was reported on by the committee on Thursday last, the 25fh of June. The report was to have been taken into consideration by the Lower Chamber on Saturday, or on Monday at latest; and this Was the more urgent that every day the benches of the Congress were thinning by the departure of deputies from Madrid, and it was evident that soon there would not be enough left to vote a law, the regulations requiring that half the Chamber, plus one deputy, should be present for a law to be legaUy voted. As yet, however, that of authorization has not been brought forward. It has been said that Ministers waited until the law of the reform of the Constitution should have passed the Senate. The reason of this is not elear, unless it be that they were unwilling to have two such unpopular ineasures under discussion at the same time, or, more probably, because these were discussed in two different Chambers, and they desired to be present at both debates. Be this as it may, yesterday the project of reform passed the Senate by 73 votes against 23; and at the close of the proceedings in the Congress, which were-of no general interest, it was announced that to-day would be discussed the report on the Mirbs loan, and to-morrow that on the authorization of the Press Law. Senor Santa Cruz, the Progresista ex-Minister, remarked that it was usual to print and distribute reports before discussing them, whichhad not been done with that ontheMfirs loan. To this the President repled, that if the re- port were not discussed to-day the Chamber would have nobusinessbeforeit,and that therefore discu-sed it should be. The truth is, that the rules and cstoms of the Chambers have no longer any force, and are trampled upon as often as it uits the convenience of the Government. Accordingly, the Mires loan comes on this afternoon, and may possibly be disposed of to-day, although, if Senor Bermudez de Castro takes up the subject, it is thought that he has it in his power to give the present Finance Minister such a shaking as may throw him out of office. It is not expected that there will be enough deputies remaining to vote the press law, in which case it is believed that it will be declared in force by a decree. Perhaps, if the truth were known, Ministers are rather sorry that they ever introduced it. There are certainly diviiions in the Cabinet on the subject, or at least on the question of promulgating it by decree. This, it is said, was recently proposed by Nocedal, and assented to by Narvaeza-who, poor man ! seems almost to have left off having any will.of his own, and always to agree with the last speaker; but Pidal objects to it. Last night the Epoca, and this morning the Clamor, two of the best newepapers authorities in Madrid, speak of the probable approaching resignation qf Pidal, and iaso of that of Seijas Lozano, the Muiister of Grace and Justice. Gonzales Bravo and Benavides are talked of to replace them. The change, however, if it takes pl%ce, wfill not do so till after the seuion. Senor Benavides enjoys an extremely bad reputation, founded ou his malpractices when formerly Civil Governor of Madrid, and indeed on his whole political life. There is no longer a doubt that the eseion of the Cortes will terminate with the present week. It was said that, when the Chambersbroke up, Genera1 O'Donnell would leave for France, in conformity with the Royal permiEsion he has obtained. I am asured that, considering the present unsettled aspect of affairs, he has changed his mind, and will remain in or near Madrid. He watches events, but it is Dot believed that he or the other Vicalvarists are conspiring. The Three per Cents. were done at38.95; ditto Deferred, 25.70-ex coupon. ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES.

1 TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Finding myself, without the slightest provocation onmy part, the object of Mr. Coninghams's attack m the House of Commons, both on Monday, the 29th of June and on' Thursday, the2d of July, I beg the favour of being permitted to anwer that gentleman through the med}ium of your colnmg On Monday, the 29th, Mr. Coningham states that "it was high time that the Teatonic element should no ouger exist in our works of art," which element ho proceeds to define as ' the system of 'r estoration,' as it is called, of redaubing the masterpieces of the great artists of the past, which came from Berlin, and was brought hero by Dr. GastavusWaagen-" To the first partI beg simply toepIy for the information of those whom the subject may interest. that, though some good restorers of pictures are to be found in Germany, as in France, Itly, and England, and many bad ones too, yet that an esecial " Teutonic element of restoration" exists solely in Mr. Coningham's imagination. To the same sourCe only may be referred the further accusation that I have been instru-mental in bringin over this supposed element to England. In the absence of all definite charge as to how such an importation was effectedby me, whether by the recommendation of Teutonicrestorers, orbytheintroductionof Teutonic secrats of the restoring art, or by counsel to English practisers of the same-whether by all or any of these forms of interference, or by any other-I can onlyr say that Mr. Coningham's assertion is equally and entirely without foundatinn. On the 2d of July Mr. Coningham's attack took other grotmd, and to my surprlse I find him engaging the valiable time of such a body as the English House of Commoas by reading to them part of a libel which appeared against me inLeipsic many years ago, which was promated solely by envy at my appointment as director of the Picture Gallery of the Royal Museum at Berlin, which contained only false assertions, whicb excited the contem t of all honest men at the time, and which has long since been consigned to oblivion. But, though astonished at his being able to occxpy the House with such oontemptible slander, I can but feel gratified that with all 3Ir. Coningham's desire to sully my character he could find no other weapon with which to eniter the field. As respects Mr. ConIngham's remarks on Mr. de Rumohr I feel myself also bound to state that they are as equally at vareance with reason and truth as thoseupon myself. Every individual inEurope who knows anything at all about the researchesinto the history of art for the last 40years is aware bow greatly the writings of Mr. de Rumohr have contributed tothedevelopementof that which isnow justly termed the science of art criticism. ThatMAr.Coninghasmshouldonlykno this gentleman as the author of a cookery book (and not, as he has stated, " of a bad cookery bookl," but an exceedlugly clever one) proves nothing more than that Mr. Coningham himself is more interested in the literature of the kitchen than of the picture gallery. This being the case, it is no wonder that Mr. Coningham should proceed to stigmatize the pictures bought by the Prussian Government atthe recommendation of Mr. de Rumohr-including, as they do, choice *pecimens of the great Florentine and Umbrian masters of the 15th century, and which are universally acknowledged to be some of the chief ornaments of the Royal Museum at Berlin-as " bad pictures." The members of Parliament who were present on these occasions and listened to Mr. Coningham, as well as the public generaUy, may perhaps gather from the above reasons how little trast is to be placed in Mr. Coningham as regards questions of art. Whether the man who so far abnses his pontion as member of the English Legislature as to make the House of Commons the field for attacks of a personsl nature be worthy of trust in other respects is a question I may leave every gentleman to decide for himself. I have the honour to remain Your obedient servant. G. P. WAAGEN. I London, July 6.

Had the East Iudian Railway been complete from Calcutta to Delhli, as it ought to have been, instead of halting halt way, the late disastrou events at Meerat and Delhi would never have occurred, or within 20 hours trooptwould have been conveyed there, whereas it will bow take about 80 days to march. Had the Northern Bengal Railway beencomplete, Irese Enilish battalions could have been poured down from Daajeeling to Calcutta and the Valley of the Ganges-, and had the Simla Railway been complete, the Commanderin-Chief would in aix hours have proceeded with his staff and European forces from Simla and Soobathoo to Delhi. Now a fortnight, at least, wil be ut in concentrating the requisite forces. It Is expected Tat the salutary example of these comparisons will lead to the immediate guarantee of the Northern Bengal Railway, the Simla Railway, and other lines. The electric telegraph communication has been already productive of the most beneficialinfluenoe in .giving increased efficiency tomilitarv movements and the energetIc action of the Government.-Hcrapath,
