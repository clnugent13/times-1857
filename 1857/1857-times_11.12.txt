MONEY-MARUUTaOAITYThTJQWJfNJOB. Wedneody Evening. 'This haa been the most anrious day in the city e3nce the height of the panic ia 1847. The first diaster announoed was the stoppage of *nother Scotch establishment-..the City of Glas:gow Bank, with a capital of 1,000,0001., a reserved fund of 90,5951., and 96 branches. This was followed by the suspension of the Lon-don discount-house of Messrs. Sanderson, Sande- nan, and Co., with liabilities for three or three and a-half millions, believed, however, to be amply -secured by commercial biBls and the property of the firm. The telegraphic accounts from Glasgow during the morning described a continuance of the run which -oommenced yesterday on the various banks, and -nearly 800,000 sovereigns in addition to the 300,000 -dapatched last evening have been sent from the Bank of England to meet the demand. It was stated also that a military force had been found necessary at Glasgow to preserve order. When the Western Bank of Scotland, which stopped on Monday, was applying for assistance to the other Scotch banks, its expectations were alleged to be based upon the fears to be entertained of the universal panic that would result if it were to close Its doors. The courage of the various institutions, however, was not to be shaken, and their stability is now being tried to the utmost. That the City of Glasgow Bank would be in danger seems to have been generally contemplated, but strong hopes are entertained that the remainder will stand their ground. The amount of its deposits is not known. They are supposed to be considerably below those of the Western of Scotland, although still of great magnitude and widely diffused owing to the number of branches and the fact of the concern having been established 19 years. It has an authorized note issue of 72,9211., and the extinction of this will be equivalent to a contraction of 48,6141. in the circulation, in addition to the suppression of 225,2921. from the failure of the WVestern Bank. Its thares are dicstributed among a larger number of persons than those of the Western Bank, -the total in that case being 1,280, while in this it is 1,309. Of the prospects of a resamption of course no conjecture can yet be formed, but from the circumstance that the bank had agencies empowered to -draw not merely in New York but Calfornia it Is to be apprehended a close investigation may show it l:as not been conducted with great prudence. The drain of gold to Scotland at the rate of more than a million in two days constitutes, of course, -s most serious addition to the pressure in London. It must have its limits, however, and these can be clearly traced. The authorized note issuea of Scotland amount to 3,087,2391. Beyond that total not a note can be put out, except -against gold. At the last return the circulation was 4,051,2391., being 96t,0001. in excess of the fixed sum, but specie was held to the amount (f 1,573,5461. The uncovered paper curreney was, therefore, 2,477,6931., and the gold sent hence to-day and yesterday is, consequently, -nearly equal to 50 per cent. of the whole. -Considerable quantities, it must be remembered, had been sent previously, and further parcels, it is said, will be forwarded to-morrow, -although it seems scarcely possible that more wil be required. If the run consisted simply of noteholders it would be altogether improbable that the existing supply would prove inadequate, but depositors are contributing to the panic, and a large number of these also claim specie. Nevertheless, whatever may be the iemand on the Scotch banks, it is plain that their power of drawing upon us must be simply to the extent of the creditF they have open, the Bank of England notes they may be able -to collect, or the funds they can realize by sales on the Stock-Exchange. Of the entire deposits which theyholdand which are estimatedat more than thirty millions, only a very moderate proportion is available in this way. As far as London is concerned, therefore, the movement now taking place bas no vague terrors. For the moment it creates a most annoying aggravation of our troubles, but as it cannot go beyond a certain point, and even at the worst is not a withdrawal of gold from the country, the Bank of England can meet it in a bolder manner and with more indifference as to the temporary effect it may have upon their reserve than would otherwzise be the case. Unfortunately the differences bet veen Scotch and EngLish law which have so long been permitted to embarrass the iutercourse between the two countries are most prominent on all financial roints. Bank of England notes are not a legal tender in Scotland, and thus it is impossible even to lessen partially the inconveniences of the case by sending the required remittances in that form. The fact of about twothirds of the Scotch circulation being in notes under 51., coupled with the known habits of the people, especially of the operative classes at Glasgow, in using the banks as places of deposit for their savings, wiU account for any popular disturbances that may now hr4ve been threatened. Such movements, however, are more evanescent and more easily met than those of larger capitalists, and, if these should not take fright, the whole affair will probably be of short duration. It appears that the rate of allowance of the Scotch banks for deposits throughout al the recent advance in the moneymarket has not been raised above 4per cent., although the changes in the ratesof discount have kept pace with those of the Bank of England. Indeed, they were recently charging 8i per cent. when the London rate was 8. The reasons assigned for keeping down the allowance for deposits are that the banks are considered to offer the only means of investment approaching in safety to mortgages or Consols, and that as the former can scarcely be obtained, and Consols pay a still lower interest, 4 per cent. is a sufficient temptation. Annexed is the circular issued by Messrs. SanderDon, Sandeman, and Co., announcing the necessity for their suspension. The liabilities of the house to depositors, by whom bills are held as security, are stated to be between three millions and three millions and a-half, while those to other parties may be about 200,0001. The great majority of the bills held being perfectly good, and such as would be discounted by the Bank of England, the depositors wil not in these cases suffer any inconvenience, and the effects of the stoppage will therefore be very limited when compared wvith the magnitude of its appearance. Ten years ago the house susDended during the crisis which then raged, and in less than five niouths it resumed business, Mr. Sandeman belng admitted as a partner. An equally favourable result is confidently hoped for on the present occasion. The principal difficulties of the firm have arisen from the failure of the Liverpool Borough Bank and Dennistoun and Co., but from neither of these sources can any ultimate deficiency be much apprehendled "- King William-street, Nov. 11. " It is with extreme pain we have to announce to you that our house is under the necessity of suspendirg its business,-an eventwhich was whollyunforeseenandunexpected by us. "The pressure of the times and the recent laumented death of our senior partner, Mr. Sanderson, have left us no alterative but to take this step, which we trust will bo but temporary. The accounts are being made up with all despateb, and in a few days they will be in a state to be anbmitted to those interested. " We are, &C., "SANDERSON, SAWDEMAN, AND CO.' The applications at the Bank to-day for discount 'were again extraordinarily numerous, but this feature loses much of its importance from the circum- stance that it is chiefly front partiv. oyer-4upplving themaselves. These persons, when they getthe money pay it into their bankers', by whom at the end of the day it is again paid into the Bank of England. Many merchants, in order to gratify an ignorant impulse of caution, have now at their bankers' two or three times the amount they ordinarily keep. The reason they give is they " do not know what may happen." They might know, if they would take the trouble to reason, that the foreign drain having been almost wholly checked, there can be no increased demand for money, except such as may be eccasioned by their own fears and by any temporary contingency like the Scotch panic; that under such circumstances, whatever is taken from the Bank must always within a few days return to it; and that under any eircumstancee the Bank will continue to afford at the fair market price every accommodation it would ever have granted even in the calmest times. It was announced this morning that the Bank of France have adopted new rates of discount in plae of the 7i per cent. fixed on the 20th of October. Henceforth the charges are to be 8 per cent. for bills not having more than 30 days to run, 9 per cent, for those under 60 days, and 10 per cent. for those between 60 and 90 days. A deeree is shortly expected to rmodify the law of 1807, which prevents bankers and traders generally from charging more than 6 per cent. The English funds opened this morning at the advanced auotations attained yesterdwy after regular hours, but the market presented an uncertain appearance, and subsequently experienced various fluctuations. The first auotation of Consols for money was 89& to #, from which on the publication of the news by the India Mai there was a further improvement to 89# to f. The stoppage of the City of Glasgow Bank then caused a reaction to 89i, from whieh there was a tendency to a new rebound, when the suspension of Messrs. Sanderson and Co. transpired, and produced a firther sudden depression, the final transactions belng at 88i to 1. For the 7th of Deceraber the last price was 89 to ;. During the morning loans on Government securities were offered at 9 per cent., but it was afterwards diflicult to obtain thera at a higher rate. The agents of the Scotch banks were active in taking all that could be had. During the day two failures were announced in the Stock-Exchange, but they were of insignificant amount. Bank Stock left off at 209 to 211; Redueed, 87A to i; New Three per Cents., 87ft to J; India Stock, 210 to 213; India Bonds, 0Os. to 40s. discount; and Exchequerbills, 25s. to 20s. discount. In the course of the afternoon a report was circulated that the Australian mail steamer Emeu had arrived at Suez with nearly a million of gold. The actual sum is 525,0001., and this opportune amount may be expected to reach Southampton by the Australasian on the 18th or 19th inst. The transactions in foreign stocks in some cases show greater depression, but business generaUy has been of an unimportaut character. Turkish fluctuated considerably during the day, and finally left off about i per cent. lower; Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 98i and 99i; Granada Two-and-a-Quarter per Cents., 1.7k ; Peruvian Fourand-a-HEalf per Cents., for the account, 74; Portuguese, 43; Turkish Six per Cents., 87i; for the account, 87i, 87, and 861; ditto, Four per Cents., Guaranteed, 96i and I ; French Three per Cents., 66; Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 95, and 95; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates,961 and 97. The corn-market was duU this morning, with a tendency to lower prices, owing to the removal of the prohibition against the exportation of wheat from France. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 60c. for money and 66f. 75c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of an eighth. At Vienna there is great heaviness, and the prernium on gold has increased. At Hamburg the rate of diseount has advanced to 10 per cent. The Paris letters mention the failure of M. Guimaraes and Co., a house in the South American trade, with liabilities for 36,0001. The Atlantic, for New York to-day, has taken out 2G,0001.. Accoiding to the trade advices from Manchester the invitation addressed to that city to join in the Glasgow demonstration against the Bank Charter Act has been declined. At the same time the Leeds Mercury intimates that the Liverpool financiers have either drawn back or for the sake of expe. diency been excluded, and the entire movement may therefore be considered a failure. The Glasgow deputation was to consist of persons chieily known from connexion with the Western Bank of Scotland, and the published list contained the name of a partner in one of the firms to whom the reckless advances are aleged to have been made which precipitated the ruin of that establishmeut. An attack upon our currency system from the representatives of a concern which, with eight miUions of British capital intrusted to its care, has brought itself to bankruptov by fostering a set of fraudulent traders to the damage of all legitimate nmerchants, is scarcely an event to injure that system in the eyes of the public. It is from sources such as these that the organizedattemptsto disturb thehealthful working of the Act have always proceeded, and in proportion as their pestilent influence is cleared away the country wiU find that the existing law renders the pursuits of commerce safe to all who will seek to understand and watch its operations. The animosity with which it is denounced by that class who fatten on such institutions as the Liverpool Borough Bank and the Western of Scotland is an indication of its value. The conflict is one of life or death. The speculator in produce, without capital or talent, assuming to be a milhonnaire, certain of a large fortune if the market advances, and trusting to the fears of his banking accomplices to uphold him if his game goes wrong-the bank with its " wealthy proprietary" (irrespective of a score or two of widows and orphans) gambling by means of re-di3counts to ten times the extent of its available resources, so as to make large dividends and surplus profits to cover the most disgraceful losse3-the popular manager, to whom everything is intrusted, usually an upstart. proud of his power to crush the business of any respectable house by backing up with unlimited loans a set of penniless proteges to counteract its operations-and the money firms who assi st the process only so long as it is thorou ghly safe; all alike are conscious that between them and the Bank Charter Act there can be no quarter. If when gold is wanted to pay our foreign creditors or to meet a sudlden emergency, like the Indian MIutiny or the American crisis, the great shipper of goods and pro. duce who a year previously was, perhaps, junior clerk in a third-rate counting-house is to be driven to sell at anyprice, because he hasnot afarthing of independent eapital to enable him to hold on; if the local joint. stock bank,instead of screening his lnsolvency,is to be eompelled from a suspension of its London facilities to let him go ; and if the whole set are ultimately obliged to break up unhelped by their former supporters, solely from the Bank of England not being allowed to issue any quantity of notes that might be necessary to postpone such a consummation, it is easy to conceive there can be no limit to the bitterness of the denunciations against the principle which leads to this inexorable conclubion. If the people at large were to allow themselves to be duped into the combination, the spectacle would indeed be deplorable. They are urged to join in a cry which wo..d. enable thosEe -wh by over speeultiou have. driven up the prices of all kinds of commodities to.- force the consumers still to pay high rates, and compel the prudent capitalist, who now finds his money worth 10 per cent., to prop up the delusion by lending it at 6. They are also asked to lower the standing of the nation in the eyes of the whole world by announcing the inability of its merchants It large to maintain their ground unless protected by an arbitrary and, as the French Emperor terms it, " empirical" Government measure to prevent capital from finding, like all other commodities, its natural price, and thus to cheat the hbolder of gold, or its equivalex, to support the holder of silk or sugar. That such insanity could be witnessed in England 13 years after the triumph of the monetary and frse trade measures of Sir Robert Peel was not to be credited, and with the abortive exhibition of the Glagow retolutionists and the recent exposures before the Currency Committee in Parliament it is to be hoped the degrading agitation on the subject will now cease. Let every respect, consideration, and sympathy be shown to those houses who, notwithstanding the exercise of caution and the possession, apparently,. of ample means, have been temporarily broken down by the American default-a calamity which they well know has been totally independent of any action on this side, but let every one who has a particle of feeling either for the rights of commerce or the financial dignity of his country ex-ert his power to sileuce the mischievous and, in ordinary times, imbecile pack who, knowing the ease with which panic can be produced in a moment of trial, are seeldng by that process to cover rp their own misjmanagement and to bring prudent and imprudent alike into a common difficulty. A meeting was held to-day of creditors of Messrs. W. and H. Brand and Co., merchants, whose suspension was announced on the 26th ult., when the following statement of affairs was submitted by Mr. Jay, the accountant:- William Brard and Robert ThomEon Bratd, trading urder the firm of William and Henry Brmad and Co., 109, Fen. church-street.

Dennistoun and Co., the Western Bank of Scotland, and the Glasgow City Bank. Should these claims come against the estate the dividend will be about 2s. 6d. in the pound, but it is hoped they will be met by the several establishments, in which case it will be about 6s. Sd. The immediate cause of the falure has been the suspension of Mr. Garner, the American correspondent of the firm, for whom Messrs. Brand have accepted to the amount of nearly 56,0001. The cash in hand is set down at 601. only, but, in addition to this, there is a balance of 3,8001. attached by the bankers. In answer to a question Mr. Jay stated that the transactions with Mr. Garner could not be considered in the light of negotiating accommodation bills, but were simply in the regular course of business, and partook more of the nature of an open credit. After a short discussion it was resolved to wind up the estate under a deed of supervision, and a committee of three creditors was appointed for that purpose. A meeting was held this afternoon of the English and Australian Copper Company, Mr. H. W. Schneider, M.P., in the chair, to confirm the resolutions passed at a meeting on the 12th of August last. In the course Of the proceedings, which were purely pro forrnd, the chairman stated that the balance on hand has increased from 20,0001. to 25,0001., notwithstanding the absorption of 9,0001. for a dividend, and that the works in Australia are being carried on with energy and success. The ore raised is also of much better quality. The Fiery Cross has arrived from China with 868,800 lb. of tea.
TRADE REPORT. Wednesday Evening. SUGAII.-The market remains in the same quiet state, and the little business doing is at cheaper rates.

The fall in the funds has exercised an unfavourable effect on the railway-market, and a general decline has taken place; towards the close, however, there was a partial recovery. The final prlces at 4 o'clock show a reduction of 11. In Lan¢ashjre and Yorkshire, Berwick, and Eastern Counties, and of about 30s. in Great Western, South-Westem, and York and North Midland. A succesaion of heavy sales on Scotch accohmt caused at one period a fall of 51. in Caledonian, a bargain. having been marked at 66, but a rally afteriwards occurred to 68i to 69. Canadian descriptions were again heavy, Grand Trunk receding 21. Indian continue firm.

XIA WAY IHTZLLrGZNUZ. WEST FLANDERS. lbe half-yerly meeting of thi oompany wra held ye$erday at the office, Moorgatetreet; Mr. W. P. Itieharda in the ehair., Mr. Cuon, the secretary, read the report, an abstract of which appeared , The Tima of Monday, The CHAIRMAN, in - oving the adoption of the report, said, he thought the progress of the company, though slow, vas satisfactory. There was an addition to their dividend of about 3d. Per share, which was an indioetion of advancement. One of the features in the report was the low rate of working the line. It Wag a matter to which Mr. Berapath had paid some attention, and he could appreciate their working at the rate oi 183I per mile for the half-year. (Hear, hear.) That was a very low figure; the working expenses were something under 200L. amile for the corresponding half of last Year. There was an apparent discrepancy in the rezut of their traffic as compared with the increae in the dividend. The increme on the old line amounted to over 6801., the increa3e on the mew lin to Poperinshe amountect to 7901., and on the Daynre line to 4201., making altogether an inremse in the receipts of nearly 1,9001. for the hall-year. Now, in scoordasioe wixt their agreement, the inrease on the old llne belonged to the company, and on the new, or guaranteedhlnes, theincreae of 7904 and 4204 belonged to the Government, or, in other words, diminished to that extent the amount payable by the Government to the company unoer the guarantee. There was also a sum of 4001. paid out of revenue for new engines The agreement was that they should be paid for by half-yearly instalments, and they were told at the time that the economy of fuel would save as much in the working expenses as the instalments for the 'ew engin would amount to, go that the price of the new engines would be met out of the savinig derived from their employment en the line. When they bought those light engines it waa arranged they sh ould be paid for by instalments of 4)01. every half-year, and they would thus be paid for in the course of five or six year. In Mr. Cbantreli'6 report there was some mention of their claim. under the guarantee to certain profits whieh had been earned on the old lne, but were abeorbed by the mode of setUlenent adopted with respect to the workiag of the new hnes. The Government guanteed the company on the new lines a certain profit of 16,000. a-year, and, it was agreed that the profits on the old line should not he affected by the arrangement. There were, howevet, some differences of otl ion as to the correct mode of ascertaining the profits ofthe old and new lines, and of apportioning them properly, which hs hoped would soon be determined. They were clearly entitled to the whole of the profits of the old line and to the guarantee on the new lines, so that the latter should yield a profit to the company of 16,0001. a-year.1 The matter was under the consideration of the Government, and as they had always been fairly treated by the Government they had no reason to suppoee they would treat them otherwise with regard to that matter. MIr. HBRAFATH remarked that what he had told them some years ago with resapect to employing much larger engines than were required for their traffic was fully borne out by the result of the worldng with light engines. They found that the difference btwaeen the large and small engies, iu the amount of fuel consumned, would be suficient to pay for the new lght engines in five or six years. That was a omost satisfactory result and he con. sidered that the workdng expenses were very low. The report was unanimously adopted, and the dividend of 2.ddper share, to bedeclared atthe general meeting in Belgium, wvas approved. T&'he Cn 3wr stated that they had purchased altogether 310 old shres out of the sml fund set aside for the purpose. Some discussion ensued as to the policy of that oourse, when it ws urged as a matter of prdence that it was necessary to have a reserve in some shape or other to meet any unforeseen contingency. On thc motion of lr. HxnAs.±ns, seconded by Mr. B;rzricx, a VOte of thanks was passed to the chatrman and directors, and the meeting separated. TRAFC RETURNS. 35. Paa Mer- TokaL Total.

ZONDON, THURSDAY, fOV.BMBER 12,1857. The glorious news from India which was made known yesterday needs no comment of ours to impress the public with a sense of its importance. After five months of suspense and anxiety we may again breathe freely. The victory has come at last-won by almost superhuman endurance, by heroism never surpassed, by energy, activity, and skill which reflect honour on all engaged, both soldiers and civilians. It may now, indeed, be said that the Indian mutiny is at an end. To cheer and support us in a great finaneial crisis we have the news that the most deadly perils have been escaped and the most brilliant successes gained on the field which has so long fixed the attention of the world. All that now rexi'M i' to follow up the victorles which have been so glntly won-to drive the enemy not only from the great towns and the military stations, but from the villages and plains, and to deliver the unhappy provinces from the scourge of a lawless and desperate soldiery. Delhi,we leam, feUl intothe hands of the British on the 20th of September, and was entirely occupied on the 21st. Thus, the whole siege of the city, from the opening of fire until finalpouession was gained,extended overonlyabout twelve days. The great assault was on the 14th, as announced by the last maiL Our loss on this day was, it would seem, understated in the former reports. The accurate return is 61 officers and 1,178 men killed and wounded, being about onethird of the storming force. This loss recalls to memory sOme of the bloodiest pauages in our military history. The annals of the Peninsular and Crimean wars can hardly afford a parallel to the slaughter on this occasion; nor is the fact to be wondered at. The British force was all and terribly disproportionate to the work to be done. Hardly any troops but our own would have ventured on such an assault in such circumstances. The Europeans amounted to less than 5,000 men; the rest of the army consisted of native auxiliaries, whose courage was untried and whose allegiance was doubtful. The city was large, strongly fortified, and defended by an army three times Sa numerous as the besiegers. To storm the place and to drive out the enemy would be difficult, while failure would be the signal for a general outburst of the fire which was smouldering far and wide. Yet the resolute Generils who commanded the British force did not hesitate. Out of their small force they could spare, it seems, only a storming party of 3,500, and with this knot of men they attacked the city, which contained within its walls the chief arsenal of 'Upper India. With what devoted courageour men must havefought may be judged from the greatness and rapidity of their succes. Thedetailsof theconffictwehaveyet to learn, but within a few days they will no doubt be given to the world in the despstches of the General and the private letters of the officers. Enough, however, for the moment is the fact that the headquarters of the mutiny are in our possession, and that the enemy is flying in various diractions, followed by moveable columns of the victorious army. The unhappy old man whom the rebels placed on the throne of Delhi surrendered to a detachment of cavalry commanded by Captain IoDsox. is two sons aud the grandson were also captured, and very properly shot at once. But we are delaying to speak of an event which will carry a feeling of joy and thankfdulnes Into every household in the kingdom. Lucknow has been relieved I In the very extremity of danger, when the besiegers, turning against us the arts we taught them, had mined the Residency, and were preparing to blow up the devoted garri- son, the force of Sir HxZNRY HAvELoCx appeared. I Let us rejoice that it has been granted to this brave and iadefatigable veteran to succeed in the great object of his campaign. If fortune had denied him the happiness of saving his countrymen from a dreadful death he would have been not the less deserving of the highest honourm which the State can bestow on courage, skill, and enterprise. We should, however, have deplored the fact that his little column was unable to penetrate the thick massez of the insurgents, and, honourlng the effort, should have pardoned the failure. But now there is nothing tD allow for or to forgive. The campaign has been crowned with complete succe. The garrison of Lucknow, after nearly four mUonths of blockade by a host of avages, is now in safety. Through what perils of war, famine, and disease must the little band have pased daring this awful time ! When we consider the weak, delicately bred women and the siekening helples children who saw every day dusky swarms surrounding them atnd thirsting for their blood-how the deferred hope of, rescue must have made their hearts sick-how their souls must have died within them, first when the noble Lwnsaqcn perished, again when the fate of Ca'wnpore reached them, again when HAvzLocE was forced back-we are led to wonder how it was in human strength to endure so long. From the 31st of May to the 25th of September these heroic souls held out, in a hastily fortified building, surrounded by tens of thousands of the enemy, and only obtaining a bare subsistence of beef and rice by desperate sorties on the besiegers. Such a defence is, we believe, without any precedent in modern warfare. Fortified towns, defended by sufficient forces, have ere now repelled for months the attacks of an enemy, and in some cases courage and desperation have struggled against overwhelming odds. But neither Genoa nor Saragoasa can rival in heroism the little Residency of Luclnow. We trust, for the sake of England and the world, that the records of the struggle wil not be lost. A faithful picture of aU that has been done and suffered by the besieged would be a book for all thie. The Residency is ituated at the extremity of the large and straggling town. This accounts for the fact that the whole place was not occupied at once. On the 25th the Residency was relieved, on the 26th the enemy's intrenchments were stormed, and on the 29th a large part of the city was taken. The los on our side amounted to 450 or 500 men. To the long list of fallen Commanders we must add General NEILL, who so greatly distinguished himself at Cawnpore. General NIcuoLsoN is also gone, having died of wounds receied in the assault of Delhi. General WILSON, it is said, retires from command, and is succeeded by General PEN-Y. Surely leaders enough have laid down their lives ot health for their country I ANsoN, BABABD, REm, WInsON, CNOisoO-N-what a rapid succession struck down before the rebellious and doomed city ! The rest of the news is unimportant by comparison. The fugitives from Delhi were dispersing in various directions. Some were marching east to Rohilcund and Oude, others south to Muttra. By our own telegram we learn that General GUSATHED, with a column 2,000 strong, was to move on to Anopshuhur; but the Government despatch speaks of two columns having been sent out, one of which reached the neighbourhood of A-Ilyghur and the other of Muttra by the 28th of September. It is possible, therefore, that the whole body of rebels have taken a southerly or - south-easterly route, and that General GaBv-- HED'S column had consequently changed its direction-unless, indeed, three distinct forces were sent out. The rest must be briefly told. NxNA SAHIB was said to be near Banda, endeavouring to effect a junction between the rebellious Gwalior Contingent end the Dinapore mutineers. Malwa, the territories of SCINfDIA and IIOLBA, in fact the whole of Central India, is still in an unsettled state, but there cen be little doubt that the news of the fall of Delhi aiud the capture of Lucknow will enable the Britisl Government and the well-affected Rajabs immediately to suppress the movement. It is a good sign that the Madras troops have attacked ani defeated the mutinous 52d, for persuading whom to treason SHTNEESl SHAH and his son suffered death. It was thought that perhaps the MIadras troops might be infected with the mutinous spirit, but this event seems to dispel any such apprehensions. The Punjab is quiet, except that some robber tribes have been infesting a parrs of the country. Scinde is also quiet, btLt the frontier requires watching, and General ;Jiwo has been 5eut uk accordingly. The Boralay Preaidency is only slightly disturbed; the Madras Presidency, the Southera Mahratta States, and the Doccan are all that could be wished. On the whole, we may congratulate the country ou the danger being past. Thereis, nodoubt,stillmuch to do, forlO0,000 armed men cannot be dispoed of in a mouth or even in six months. But we have no longer before us the apparition of a hostile Empire, capital, and army. All that remaius is a set of ifolated bands, ravaging the country without purpose, system, or hope of succes. To rout and exterminate this ruffian rabble must be the work of the troops who have by this time poured into the country, but who will have found the main strength of the mutineers destroyed before they rrrived.
The comparison which Professor BLAOcK institutes between the English and Scotch luniversities is drawn with great truth and discrimination. In the sense of educating all classe of the nation the Scotch Universities are more national institutions than the 1English. On the other hand, the English Universities give a far higher education than the Scotch. These are the- respective excellencies and the respective defects of the twvo. The confluence of all classe to the Scotch Universities is a jUst matter of pride to the Scotch institution, and Professor BLACK0E, while he appreciates so highly the superior quality of the English fruit, tiU verynaturally and properly points to the greater quantity of the Scotch produce as a true and unquestionable merit. "I Will not " throw," he says, " an unpatriotic shade over the " manifest virtues of our native institutions." While, therefore, he deplores the low standard of the Scotch institutions, he calls attention-snd he has a right to do so-to the larger area covered by them, their greater popularity, the general use made of them by all classes, as a matter for boast. On the other hand, while he estimates so keenly the superior standard of the English institutions, and the much higher culture which iLsues out of them, he remarks upon their narrowness of ground-the comparatively small use made of them by the population at large. What he wants, therefore, ig a combination of the two features; he wants finish for the Scotch Univereity, extenion for the English. For the former he wants, besides Professors, a reguhar tutorial staff, like the one at Oxford and Cambridge, and up to the same standard of instruction. For the latter he wants greater breadth and variety of teaching-such, indeed, as he admits has now partially been gained-more sympathy with the popular wants, more hold over the masses, and power of attracting them to its arena. A University, to perform its true fumctions, ought, according to the Professor, both to educate e*tensivdy and to educate 1ig7dy-to be Glasgow and Oxford united. Now, we do not object to this as the ideal standard of a University, but we are sorry to say that it appea to us totally impracticable at the present day. The exigencies of our comniercial and professional life are such that people cannot afford more than a certain time for education; the youth of 16 cannot-as hls basinesslike father or guardian would probably express it-go " dawdling on" with mental improvement; time and tide wait for no man; he must set to work upon the business of life, he must begin learning a profepion. If he stays sauntering in the groves of AcADEmus he may turn out a good scholar and an accomplished man, but others will have had the start of him in the race of life. But, this being the case, it is perfectly evident that what is called a high education cannot be an extensive education, or the education of the mass even of the middle class, but must be confined to a comparatively few, whose profeson, like that of the English clergyman, can wait for the finishing stroke, or whose independent fortunes release them from necessity for hurry at their entrance into life. For the great middleclass mases, who have to "get on," and to be quick about it, it is nonsense talling of a hilgh, or, in the English sense of the pbrase, " a University education." A " University "education") requires time, and this is exactly what the demands of active life cannot spare. It requires just those very three or four or five years which the commencing trade or profession lays its hand upon, and declares that it must have. But such a state of things as this at once dissolves the combination upon which Pro.essor BLAcIEs is so intent, and separates the plan of extensive education from the plan of high education. The Scotch Universities have the merit of extension; they are national institutions in the sense of spreading over the whole area of the nat?on and educating all classes. But to what is this extension attributable ? Why, simply to the fact that they do not give a high education-that is, one involving length of time. They give an education taking up such time as the middle-class m es can afford, and therefore the Scotch middle claases naturally send their sons there. They are convenient places of education for these classes--they are, in fact, schools; we call them Universities, and in some respects they may really do University work, but in the principal and most popular work they do for the country they are not UJniversities properly, but schools. They do for the Scotch what our schoolsnot what our Universities-do for us. "The "Scottish students," says Professor BLAcmrE, "are in a great proportion boys. The admission "of mere boys to the highest seat of learning in "the country is an abuse of the grossest kind-an "abuse which ix subversive of the very idea of a "University." But, if boys are the staple of a Scotch University, -we should rather argue, for our part, that the institution was in reality not so much a University as a school. The Professor argues, like the schoolmen of the middle ages, from the idea of a University, against the general admisaion of boys; we are inclined to argue, from the fact of the general admission of boys, against the institution being a Uaiversity in the true sense. But the verbal question is of no importance; you may call a place what you like, but what it really is, that depends not on the name or the title, but on the facts of the case. Institutions are what facts make them, and it is vain to argue that they are not onu thing or another because they are called by this name or that. Whatever the Scotch Universities were originally, the course of events has practically turned them mainly into large schools for the education of the middle and lower clasb boys. If this education of boys is concducted by a set of learned Professors, instead of by masters armed v ith all the proper weapons of magisterial sway, as it is in this country, all we can fay is that this is a very awkward machinery for the purpose. But it is not the teacher, but the pupil that stamps the institution, because the teacher is obliged practically to be what the age and proficiency of the pupil recluire; he may be called a Professor, but he is really a schoolmaster if he teaches boys. Re may be a bad schoolmaster, and we think that Scotch University training in Eome respects shows this ; he cannot really descend so much as he ought to the level of his boys. he kicks against his work-Professw BLACYEn kicks fiercely-he tries to irnp:ove upon it, to give a professorial and recondite tone to it, which can only produce smateering, instead of sound education, as the. iruit. But the Scotch Universltyx is not prcticallsy lesa a school QnusZQ toe §hoolmaater :% wn. un.ft one, sud aQoy.q hix workL If its papils areboys, it is a schbolto all intents and purposes. And,. therofore, wha does Profesaor BLAoxiz gain by dimnissing the boys? He mnakes an empty school, but not a full University. Who is there to come when the bop are gone ? As large a number of young men, he will say, as there is of boys now. Yes; but, as we say, that is exactly what he cannot have. The age and the number of the Scotch academical youth go together. If you raise the age you diminish the number, because you encroach upon the confines of profesional and commercial life. In proportion as a Scotch tJniversity rises to the English height of standard it will inevitably and infallibly lose in the breadth of its area; it can only gain finish at the cost of extension. The instant it becomes a place of high education it is emptied,-the use of it is limited to that comparatively small class which supplies the alumni of our English Universities. We may admire, then, Professor BLACKiS academical aspirations, but we do not think them, in the state of things in which we find ourselvets, ever likely to be realized. He aims at a combination of two favourable characteristics which can only exist apart fronm each other,-height of standard and extension too. This union may constitute the ideal University, but, if it does, we must be content without such a 'University. We may haye useful and efficient Universities that fulfil the one or the other of thesetasks. The ScotchUniversities have the merit of extension, they educate all classes; they do this, it is true, by a most absurd and awkward professorial machineLy, not the least adapted for teaching boys,-still they give education, and give it to all classes. This is useful work. The English Universities, on the other hand, do not educate so many, but the culture they give is high, aud raises the general standard of education in the country. Useful Universities, then, we have, that execute one or other of these two tasks, but we may wait a long time for a University that will do both.
A comparisonL of the population of these island% with the strength assigned to our military establishments will place beyond aU question the competence of England to maintain such an army as the Imperial extent of her dominions requires. A single glance at the facts tersely expressci by Lord PALMESTON at the Mansion-house will show that the results in this case coincide with the reckoning, and that -what we ought to have managed has been actually done. After this there may seem little room for any further discussion. If, according to al reasonable calculations so many soldiers should be forthcoming from our population in so many months, and if these levies are found duly producible, it is hard to see what more can be required. It does, however, appear evident, and wilU probably occur to every reader's mind, that our recruiting system is not yet exactly what it ought to be. Possibly, as some of our correxpondenta think, we do not in all cases get the proper class of men, and, what is more obvious, there is always too much urgency and scramble attending tho proceeding. An augmentation of the army occasions a species of panic, resembling in some degree the convulsions of the commercial world. There is a sudden run upon the population, soldiers are called for at any price, and the State has to increase its biddings and lower its demands. To be sure we always pull through such difficulties, and get the aimy -we want, but it occasionally comes rather too late for the emergency, and we find ourselves with a superfluity of resources just when the need is over. To obviate the latter difficulty there is one method, and only one, open to us-fortunately, involving no kind of trouble and very little expense. It was well explained by the COms1ERnx-CHIzr at Sheffield the other day, when his Royal E3ighness remarked, that if the ordinary and current demands upon an army required a force of 50,000 men, common prudence suggested that 55,000 should bekeptto meet them. Double these figures and we obtain something like the very case before us. If we had possessed 10,000 troops in the form of a disposable reserve we might have escaped all the agitation of the last six months. We could not, indeed, have dispatched reinforcements to India more rapidly than was actually done, for our regimentswere sent off as theystood without a moment's hesitetion, and the work of filling up the gaps was left to be done afterwards; but we might have saved ourselves the pressure which intervened between the embarcation of the old army and the formation of a new one. As it was, we rushed head over heels to make up for lost time, and though we have succeeded in doing so, it has been at some cost to our patience and perhaps to our pockets. The moral at this point is plain enough. We must make more allowance for contingencies in determining the scale of our establishments. We may not have another Crimean war, or another Caffre war, or another Indian mutiny-indeed, our statesmen will be deeply to blame if they leave so much as a chance for a second catastrophe of the latter kind-but though we may not encounter these identical difficulties, we may easily meet with others just as much out of the ordinary way. A man with a dozen childrena is always liable to sudden calls, and a State with dominions in every quarter of the globe is exposed at any minute to demands upon its military strength. But, after all this has been said and assented to, there s,till remains the abstract question of recruiting-that is to say, the relations and attitude assumed by the State in its invitation to citizens to take upon themselves the work of fighting for the community. W"e think these relations, though they have been wonderfully improved of la.e years, still admit of reform, or rather of better expression. As far as regards the terms of service they are probably, in substance, sufficiently favourable. They certainly insure a man good food, good lodging, good clothing, opportunities of education, atterdance in rickness, and a certain allowance upon disability or superannuation. Admit that the risks are considerable, that there is great likelihood of hardship and almost a certainty of expatriation for a longer or shorter period-these prospects would surely not operate seriously or generally tothe prejudice of military service. The natives of these isles take to foreign scenes as naturally as their roving ancestors, nor do the chances of death or mutilation prevent men from crowding in shoals. to unhealthy or hazardous occupations. Miners pass their lives underground in perils from firedamp and fifty other liabilities, sailors go off to, a merchant service where they may be maimed and murdered by brutal captains, and no work, however noisome or deadly, is ever brought to a stand for want of hands to complete it. All these, ordinary dangers, too, are encountered without stimulus and without reward, whereas a soldier when lhe faces peril does it in gallant company, with the eyes of his countrymen upon him, and the certainty of honour for his courage. It is not in the easb degree likely, considering the spirit and even the recklessness shown by the people of this countrv on aU occasions, that the perils of a solier's life tell otherwise th.an in its favour; in fact, we know that they prove actually attractime, for the servime is never so popular and recruiting never so brisk as wher± the realities of war a3a battle are broiwht home to the nation. The grt fight od InkeJerS4nn did more to fill the army than 0 tr cent. ijXreaas of pay would have done. If, thoa, military Aervico hag rtagM re. I pulsive In ibelf, and if the terms it Secures are dec&dedly advantaeous, why need there be any solicitation reqtread in this more than m' other demands for labourt If acontractor for any larga undertaking wants 100 or 1,000 men, he sinply notifies his desire, and applicants appear directly. In the moat laborious and worst paid trades any number of hands can be procurod for askiog at the ordinary market price; and if the advantages of the job ae a little above the common, there is literally no limit to the rush and scramble for employment. Now, as the conditions of military life certainly are superior to those of many other avocations, why shoula not the simple announce. ment that so many soldiers are wanted suffice to fill the ranks of the army without further ado? We do not forget that the applicants mus bring certain qualifications of health and stature, but, on the other hand, it should be remembered that they are not expected to possess the least previous knowledge or training. For any other work an apprenticeship of some kind or other is invAriably exacted. Some amount of skil or practice must be acquired before a man can even mend a road, or dig at a tunnel, or follo-w a plough. In the navy it takes years before a man can be rated as an ablebodied seaman. The army alone is fed by -wholly unskilled labour. This is the only profession in which a lad is taken, without tne smallest knowledge of his intended duties, put at once upon full pay, and taught his work without charge by the very employers who engage him. Allowing for the disadvantages naturally produced by pressure and precipitation, we suspect the explanation of the whole case will be found in the tenacity with which ancient traditions have been preserved. There certainly was a time wherL military service-though probably even then not 'worse than other services at the moment-was regarded, both on one side and tLe other, as an occupation which no man would adopt in his sober moments, and inuto which therefore it was necessary to entrap people by drunkennes or delusion. In those days the bargain lasted for life, corporal punishments were inflicted with great severity, and the daily routine of a soldier's duties, though giving many opportunities for rude debauchery, offered few chances of rational improvement. As a natural consequence, parents kept their children from a pursuit which was usually the resource of the most worthless, and which was expected to render worthless tho who were originally deserving, so that trickery and misrepresentation -were employed to disguise a bargain unpalatable in itself. Look at any tale or drama of sixty years since, and the recruiting sergeant will be found described as little more or less than a licensed kidnapper-a man whose employment consisted in decoying youths from their homes by false pictures of military life, and then shipping them off to misery and repentance in some distant land. Ihe conditions of service are now wholly changed, but we are not gure that all the old impressions have changed also, and the seeming anxiety of solicitation which a pressure for men induces is not ill-calculated to keep apprehensions allve. The same may be said of that arrangement of teras by which bounty and pay are put prominently forward, and deductions and stoppages kept in the background. Much has here been done in the way of improvemnent, but if the reforms were thoroughly carried out, if the conditions of service were proclaimed without the least artificial enhancement, and if we saved ourselves the necessity of a run upon the market by maintaining some available reserve, we are convinced that the British army would at least hold its own among other professions in attracting the most eligible of the British youth.

INDIA. TEE CAPTURE OF DELHI AND THE .RELIEF OF LUCKNOW. We publi-hed yesterday in second and third edL *i0or. the telegrams received by the Foreign-office -and by the India-house of the contents of the Bombay mail of the 18th of October. We have since then received a fuller despatch from Cagliri .-fron our own correspondent. It is as follow :- (BY WB~URM AD BRllq8H TELEGRAPH.) ALEXANDRIA, Nov. 5. The Pottlnger reached Suez on the 2d inubt., with dates from Bombay to the 18th of October. General Havelock stormed and carried the enemy's position at Meengarsour on the 21st of September, and corntinued his advance towards Lucknow, .rving the Insurgents before him. On the 26th the Residency was relieved, and on the 26th the besiegers' intrenchments were captured; our 'osw was 400 killed and wounded, and, among the former, General Neil. The latest intelligence is dated Cawnpore, Oct. 2. Nearly the whole of the city (Lucknow) was In our possession; the resistance is said to have been very -obstinate. Delhi wan completely subjugated on the 21st of Saptember. The enemy had abandoned their camp beyond the walls. The King of Delhi was a prisoner. The three Princes had aleo been captured -and immediately shot. Our loss in killed and wounded on the 14th is estimated at nearly 1,200. The subsequent los appears to have been slight. General Nicholson hcd died of his wounds. The latest news from Delhi, rUi Lahore, is to the -3d of October. General Groathed, with a column 2,000 strong, 4ent in pursuit of fugitives, was to move on to Anop Shekur, on the way to Rohilcund. General Wilson had resigned the command from ill health, and was succeeded by General Penny. The official despatehes are not yet received, and information is still very defective. The Dinapore mutineers have, it is feared, got as far up the country as Bands. Rena Sahib is believed to be in that neighbourheod, exciting the Gwalior mutineers to join them. She Madras column, in falling back upon Jubbulpore, had attacked and defeated the revolted 52d. Anxiety was felt for the garrison at Saugor, which -comprirer a number of women and children. Scinde and Guzerat are quiet. There haa been some disturbance among the Bheels in Kandeish. The Punjab ix still disturbed between Lahore and Mooltan, but In a very trifling degree.

THEB MONRy PANIC. (BY EIRO AND naRWATIONAL TsXLRAPH.) GLASGOW, Nov. 11. This morning the City of Glasgow Bank suspended payment, 'which event created great excitement in the city. There was a run upon the National Security Savings Bank, and also upon the British Linen Company; but while the latter bank was paying out gold the officlals were very busy in receiving deposits. The run upon the UJnion Bank was met with the greatest readiness by the resources of the establi3hment and the large arrivals of gold. The further supplies expected from London seem to have quieted any feeling of panic, the run having greatly subded. The dlrectors of the City of Glasgow Bank iaued a notice that they had suspended payment in the meantime, in consequence of the great demand made upon them for gold. During the day, however, the excitement caued by the event was greatly lemened by the fact that the other banks in town were accepting Weatern and City of Glasgow banknotes in the transaction of business, a coue which the city authorities also adopted in receiving payment of the city taxes. The panic seems to be rapidly subsiding.
ITHE FINIANCAIL CRISP IN PRANCE. The Monite'ur publishes the following letter addressed by the Emperor to the Minister ot Finance- "Monsieur le Ministre,-4 see with pain that, without an apparent or real cause, pubUc credit ls assailed by chimerical fears and by the propagation of sui-disant remedies for an evil which only exists in the imagination. In preceding years, it must be owned, there were some grounds for apprehension. A succession of bad harvests compelled us to export annually many hundreds of millions in specie to pay for the quantity of corn of which we stood in need, and yet we were able to meet the crisis and to defy the sad predictions of alarmists by a few simple measures of prudence taken momentarily by the Bank of France. How is it, then, that at the present moment it is not understood that a similar measure, rendered still more easy by the law which allows an increase of the rate of discount, must suffice dfortiori to preserve to the Bank the specie which It wants, as we are in a much better condition than we were in last year, having had an abundant harvest and a most considerable metallic reserve in the Bank ? " I therefore beg of you publicly to deny aU the absuird projects attributed to the Government, the propagation of which so easily causes alarm. It is not withoat some pride that we may state that France is the country in Europe where public credit rests on the broadest and on the most solid basis. The remarkable report you addressed to me thereon is the proof thereof. Give heart to those who are vainly alarmed, and assure them that I am firmly resolved not to employ those empirical means which have only been had recourse to in circumstances, happily so rare, when catastrophes beyond human foresight have befallea the country.

The late BPIGADIE-GElNBRALS NICHOLI ~~SON and NE=IL. As our readers are already aware, from another pordonof our impression, Del'i and Lucknow have not faUen into the hands of our votorious army without the lows of mome able an gllant officers, including Brigadier-General NeiU and Brigadier General Nicholson, the latter of whom is reported as hbaing died of his wounds received at the capture of Delh. Both of these Generals a few short weeks ago were mentioned in the London Gazcte as having been promoted to the Companionship of the Bath in reward of their distinguished Indian services, which now. alas I have been dran to so sudden a close. General John Nicholson, of the 27th Bengal Native Infantry, ws an officer of no ordinary experience and promis. At the time of his decease he ws in command of the Punjab difion. He was the eldest son of the late Dr. Alexauder Nicholson, who owned a small landed proprty in the county of Down, and who died a few year sine., having practised with considerable success as a physician at *Virgemont, county of Dublin. HM mother was a sister of Sir James Weir Hogg, late Chairman of the East India Company, and formerly MP. for Beverley and Honiton. . John Nicholson was born at Virgemont on the 11th of December, 1822, and having reoeived his early education at the Grammar School of Dangannon, county of TYrone, obtained from his uncle a direct appointment to India early in 1839, where he arrived in the July of the sare year. At the very outset of his career in India he gained some practal experience in war. The conquest of Cabul, s our readers are aware, was followed by the rovolt of the Affghans. At the period of the murder of Sir William MwNaghten and the massacre of the British troopB at Jug. dulluck, Nliholson was in the fortress of Ghuznee, nnder Coloizel Palmer, and shared with him the dangers of the siege. There is no need to recapitulate here tne details of that event; it is enough to say that the BrItish force found themaelvee -shut up in the citdel, and, having suffered the extremities of htuger, were forood to capitulate on honourable terms. low those terms were broken and how Nicholson was forced to give up his sword is no;r a matter of history, as Is also his hi. prisonment with his comrades in Cabul and his subsequent restoration to libertyon the arrival of the gallant Sir Robert Sale and Sir G. Pollock, the real heroes who retrieved the disasters of Lord Auckland's Indin administration. We next find GeneraL Nicholson serving in the Sntlej campaig of 1845-46. At the time of the outbreak of that war he rendered important servie to Sir Henry Harding6 by watching and reporting the movements of the Sikbs He wus sio present at the bloody battlefields of Moodkhse and Ferozesbah, and received a medal for his gallantry in action. In the second Punjab campaign we fnd the name of General Nicholson almost insepable from that of Major Herbert Edwardes, the hero of Mooltan. It would be foreign to our intention here to recount all the events whioh led to the outbumt of that war, which was so decidedly settled at Sadoolapore, Chilianwallah, and Goojerat. It is suffiient for our purpose to inform our readers that while the siege of Mooltan was still proceeding Nicholson was sent to seize the fortress of Attock, which he succeeded in taking. As soon as his services could be spared he accompanied Lord Gough in his advance, and ws able to render Sir J. Thackwell masterial assistance in transportng his forces ecross the Chenab just previous to the battle of Ramnuggur. He had the satisfaction of seeing his name mentioned in the despatch of that gallant and distinguished officer in the following terms:-" To Captain Nicholson, assistant to the Resident at Lahore, I beg to offer my bet thnks for his endeavours to procure intelligence of the enemy's movements, for his successful effortB to procure supplies for the troops, and for his able assistanoe on all occasions." After the battle of Chilianwallah his friends had the additional gratification of seeing his servicee ln that engagement acknowledged in Lord Gough's despatch side by side with those of the late lamented Sir Henry M. IAwrence. Nor wu he less distin. guished on the feld of Goojerat, where Lord Gough finally routed and crushed the Sikh forces, and after which he particularly recommended, In his despatch addressed to the Governor-General of India, "that most energetic political officer Captain Nicholson," as deserving of reward and promotion. For his services in the Punjab campaign Captain Nlcholson was promoted by special brevet tothe rank of Major in the army, and received the additional honours of a medal and a clasp. He had been enged in cvil employment in the Punjab for some few years before the outbreak of the recent mutinies, having had under his charge the Dera Ishmail Khan district since January, 1852. Of his activity and energy in his civil capaity in the Panjab, and of his gallantry in defeating the rebel forces sent out to litercept the siege-train orn its wv.y to Delhli, we have spoken too often reoently to make it necesary to add any fresh meed of prds The previous mail, it will be remembered, brought home tidings that Colonel Nicholson was among those who were wounded In the storming; of Delhi, and now we deeply regret to have to enumerate his ame among those who have since died of their wounds. Colonel Nicholsnos commisdons, we should add, bear date as follows :-Enalgn February the 24th, 1839; ideuteioa, Jznary the 13th, 1842; Regimental Captain, with rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, MarIlithe 20th, 1848. Brigadler-General James George Smith Neill, of the Madras Fusileers, was a native of Scotland, and was truly one of whom his native county, Arhl, wll be proud. He was the eldest son of the late Lieutenant-Colonel Smith NeWl, of Barnweiil and Swindridyemulr, and succeeded at the death of his father to a small landed property between Ayr and Glasgow, where doubtless be looked forward to spend the remainder of hs days when he should have retired from active service; but It has been ordered otherwise. He was born about the year 1810, and entered the 1st European Fusileers (Madras) In 1826. He first saw some active service, we believe, in the first Burmese war, under the Governor-Generalship of Lord Amherat, vwhen he was for a time in the Adjutant-General's department. He was, however, compelled to return to EDgland on furlough at the olose of the campaign, owing to the inroads made upon his constitution by exposure while on field servico. For a short time, about the years 1835 and 186, hbeheld the command of the escort of the Resident at the Court of his Highness the Rajah of Nagpore, and about the same time he married Is-bella, daughter of Colonel Warde. More recently he took part in the second Burmese war under Lord Dalhonsie. On the outbreak of the war wlth Russia in 1854 he volunteered for active service in Turkey, and showed considerable ability while in command of the Turkish Contingent. Returning to India at the closo of the war, he took the command of the 1st Madras European Fusileers, one of the most gallant and distinguished regiments belonging to the service, though recently characterized by Sir Archibald Alison in his speech at Glasgows as " newr to fame." On the breaking out of the recent mutiny, being sent up to Calcutta wiith his regiment, he relieved Benares, and pressed on with forced marches to Cawnpore, in the cap. ture of which he assisted. Oar readers 'am not have forgotten bis deoiou ion the matter of the high-caste Brahmins of that place, whom he forced to degrade themselves by washing with their own hands the bloodstained floor which was the scene of the atrocities of Nena Sahib. During the subsequent absence of General Havelock he held the command of Cawnpore, and was recently iutrusted with the command of a Brlgade. He Is repreEented to us, by those who knew him of old, as a strict disciplinarian, bt at the same time one who never spared himself, and wvas alwa ys ready to- share with his men every danger, diiculty, andprivation. He attained the regiment3l rank of Major in 1850, and became a Major in the Madras army, with the rank of LieutenantColonel, in December, 1853.
THE BO YA r, BRITISH RHAr. A meeting was held last evening at the Gulldbaln Tavern, in pursuance of a circular suggesting that the shareholders should then meet to take into consideration the proprlety of subscribinz the sun necessary to carry out an arrangement under which the creditors had eonsented to acoept 13s, 6d. in the pound, in additlon to 10s. in the pound acoruing from the estate. After considerable discussion, Mr. R. P. Hariing, the official manager, said the sam required was 164,0OtO Of this 67,000. had been subscribed; and, without referring to other shareholders, there wete D-v who 3eld 519 shares from whom no offer whatever had been roceived. Stops had been taken fo ascertain the names of these parties, and it was calculated that a sum of 113jOO1O could be obtained from them. It was suggested that ir Glllett4 Mir. Mitcaell, Mr. R. P. Harding, and other genfAemen should retire iato a separate room aad receive propo3als. At the termination of these interviews, Mr. Harding n orteld that, in additioa to the 65,00. already referred to, 27,9W1. hd been proinised by former shareholdcrs, 4,000O. by MT.

This made the amiount 107,7001. ouk. ofi the required 180,0001., and Mr. Hardinu expressed himself as has.ng no doubt that the reguired amount could be got Mr. Poarse said he felt, aftv thirs tha! tho assignees were in a position to deal with efery irdividnal 0hareholder as his caew required, and that tie-.e siould be no delay in prosccuting their claims upon shnrebolders who had not as yet contrTibated.

I TIHE CAMP AT ALDERSHOTT. Though the routine fielddays at Aldershott, when two or three timaes a-week In the summer the unbappy erieriny wal driren half-wsy to Winchester, ur now over, yet the large importation of militiamen into the Camp hdenredextra drill most necessary; advantage Is therefore taken of every tolerably fine dty to give the men a smart breathing across the hills and valloys. Yesterday the scaleof operations was rather enlarged,.snd the forces of the Camp were mustered for a sudden general attack upon a neighbourigrailitar initntion,-the Cadets' College at Sandhurst. This plan involved manctvres of aU kinds, and required the assistance of the three branches of the service, and as the first step was a march of some seven or eight miles, the whole force was under arms in camp by 8 o'clock. The troops were in heavy marching order; eah man cArring so many rounds of blank cartridge, and apparently a good many rounds of ammaunition of a more pleasant klind in their havresacks. Some waggons accompanied the troops with barels of beer for their further support during the fatigne of the attack. There were several regiments of.Infantry, a strong force of Artillery, with the 6th battaion of the Militay Train, and part of the 1t battalion, in all between 7,OOO and 8,000 men. Bat theforce in appearance looked far more imposing, occupying a good two miles of country road. The whole force marched from camp along the road to FaMboroughb and so onthrough Frimley toSandhurst,where It Arrived shortly before 1L The day was unsually fine, the sunbright and clear, the air keen but bracing, and the mists that lay about in and amongthe tress and vnlleys only added greater variety to the picturesqueness of the scene. A very large concourse of visitors fom the, surrounding neighbourhood had asembled in the grounds round the College, which were freely thrownopens to all comers, and from whioh the bst vie w of the proceedings could be gained. The attaching force outnumbered the cadets pearly 50 to one, for the latter, who were divided into three companiesm were not 200 strong, and were only assisted by some 15 or 20 cavalry, withL party of engineers to work their four small guns. Nevertbeless, the little band put a bold face On the matter; they ha&already intrenhbed themselves, and aLow stood finn, hopeless of victory, but determined to fight for it,. The nature of their position may be soon told. The large sheet of ornamental water in front of the College I terminates at either end in a broad and deep canal, crossed by several bridges, which of course formed the keys of their whole position. Their force was divided into three bodiesthe extreme right, under Captain Dickens, occupied the 5kirt of the wood on the road near Forest-lodge. The centre, under Major Man, held the YorkTown avenue In advance of the lake bridge, the head of which was defended bya strong gablonade and rihvaux-de-friss. The mainrbody on the left under Colonel Scott, occupied the wood in front of King's bridge, with a small party holding a very narrow structure, caled the Chinese-bridge. But King's-bridge was the main point, and wasdefendedby a cnevaux-de-friseandabattis, in rear of which again was a strong work called Adams redoubt, strengthened with a stockade and mined with a heavy chirge of powder. In rear of all was the Old Flagstaff Bat. tery, the cadets' last resource and rallylng point. Lieu, tenant-General Sir Hary Jones commanded the Sandhurst forces in chief. TheCampforces,underMajor-GeneralEnolys, advanced to the attack in two main divisions, the right underMajor-General Lord WilliazPalett, consisting of two coapwaies of Engineers with the pontoons, part of the 4th I.ght Dragoons, a troop of Horse Artillery, a field battery, the 22d Regiment, the 4th Middlesex and Royal Wl31tshire Mlitia Regiments. The centre body, under Major-General the Ron. A. Spenoer, consisted of a field battery, the 15th and 96th Regiments, and the 4tih Lancashlre Milatia. Tho Berks MEiltia, assisted by a poetioa of the cavalry under Major-General Laurenson, threatenedon the left. The plan of attack was a feint on the right of the College position at Forest-lodge-a real attack on the left at King's-bridge, to be fellowed and supported by an attack on the centre from York Town. The affair commenced with a sldirmishing fire on the right, which continued for some tine, now rising to the noisy dignity of a regular fusillade, and then again dropping to a mere random ahot at long intervals. Vedettes scoured about, but the nature of the ground was against good reconnoitring, and thick woods almost completely cQncealed their movements and preparations on the right and centr Under cover of these, and protected by their skirmishers in front, the main attack advanced against King's-bridgo, where they were encountered In the wood by the cadets, and a heavy fire inxtantly commenced. This, as more and more of the Camp forces came into action, was maintained with additional vigour each moment, and at last swelled into a long-sustained rattle, which instantly showed the non-professional publio wher, the great onset was, and thither they flocked accordingly. The cadets made along fight of It, disputing every inch of ground, and making every brake and tree a temporary lodgment for their sharpxhooters. At length the suprlority of numbers of the enemy oompelled them to give way a.d zetlre under the Abattis at the Kiung's-bridge. This they did In good order,' still fighting as they retreated. The shots now resounded from every part of the wood, which was filled with a dense smoke, amid which the masses of the enemy were alimost hidden, until, overcoming all obstacles, they emerged on the banks of the canal in front of the abattis and cheuvux-dc-frise. These held them in check for a considerable time. While the attack upon it was pressed with vigour, and orders were sent to hurry up the field battery and force It, the 4th Light Dragoons, a troop of Horse Artlllery, a party of Engineers, with the pontoorAs and mili. ta train, and the 22d Regiment were sent higher up the canal to effect a passage at another point. A few minutes after this force had been sent off on a mission so fatal to the defenders the artilery camo into play in the abattis, sending its massive red streaks of flame into the very centre of the felled trees, and scattering their leaves and twigs like spray. At the same moment the attack was pressed upon the centre, and now all along the border of the lake were posted cannon, while the woods swarmed with troops, and every gun and Mlni6 in the force converged upon two points and poured a volley of flame and smoke upon the ling's and centre bridges. There were a fewr minutes of terrific uproar, during which the whole College and ground became so densely wrapped in smoke that It was quite imposible, save for those actually wl the troops, to see whatwas passing. Inthe midst of t:- scenethewhole line of theenemyadvanced agaimt the two bridges; at the centre the attack was repulsed amid an awful din of small arms; at King's-bridge it was successful-the cadets retired, and by this movement lost the day. They fell back into Adams'5 redoubt, which,as wehave said, was averystrong work, deeply trenobed and stockaded at the entrance,and which had been mined in case of their being compelled to abandon it. The enemy, however, after losing some time in destroying the &battbs, crossed King's-bridge, and attaed the redoubt with artillery, while the detached force, which had crossed higher up in pontoong and by the Chinese-bridge, attacked it from the other side. The redoubt became untenable, and the cadetslit theirmineand abandoned it, netirlng into the Slagstaff Battery, while the centre and right division alsofeliback, To cover this movement their hand6el of cavalry charged the Camp troops, which were crossing the bridges and defiling in the open ground beyond, and compelled them to halt and form squares in their own defencee At the same time the mine in tie redoubt blew up vibb a fearful emplodon, lifting a locse cloud of earth and. stones high into.the asb. These twin enhsi hnw-A..,- ,-.i.. r P,p,, attack -s pressed with a chazge of the 4th Dragoons, which aswept the open ground lik a whirlwind of mea and homses, leaving a broad deep treek of scattered turf whera they had passed. This last onset effeotually drove the cadets back t the verycolonnade of the CoUege, whitherthVe were pursued, when both parties came to a stand, and a genu2al deliery of all the spars ammunition took place an all sides, and this sulphcr6ans oUma; bought. th& pzoo ceedings to a close. Marching past then too2-. place in the usmal order, the edets taking precedence of &A the infantry. Their marching was most zegular for sucl:a very juLvenile body of soldiers, and their admirable coud4ct and discipline throughoat the day elicited the highue% commendations from General nculIys, and was, in facb, a subject of general re7nark and admiration among axi tle officers on tbo ground. The marciing of the Eoa.l Wiltshire Militia was also considered most exoElent. Immediately alter the review the mounted troops zeturned to caap. Th4 infantry followed when theyr h7^>feshed an, rested themselves. Tho Camp will be furtber srrengthened on Thursday next by the arrival of the 3d West York Militia, and on Friday by the Royal Durnfries Militia.

The Free, man of yesterday mornng led the way in a sensible article tending to calm the excitement consequent; upon the recent sinprecedented advance in the rate i of discount. The AreAsW Post follows in the same ' creditable course, and concludes a rather lengthened! review of the state of the money-markets in | England and Ireland the term ;- i " We have heard that the Bank of England during the whole of this exoitement hae ot in say izstaae refased legittacommodatio-It enAnme The Bank of; Ireland, it is weU known icomerei ircles, has not In the least degree deoreased thoee faities it hs been in the babit of affording- azd thofislrbenks generally, we know, have acted with the utmost degree of liberality consistent with pradence. As regarft the home trade, the whole qestion is the differenoe between a higber and a lower charge in the percentage for lterest d g thi- temporay pressure-a difference, even ir It lasted for thbre months, which it moat probably wil not that would not amount to ere- than 20s. or . upon x 91 dae bil for lOOI Th8 ixati transactlons, lrge and small, w;old be some curtilment of profits; but let it be remembered that the Bank of Ireltad and the other banks accommodato their customerm sel, that ther is no curtailment of discounts, no interferenoe with the legiti. mate operations of trade; and further let this be ben in mind, that any limitation of diso=pta by the banks, even for a ingle day, would produce far gte*%r Ioss and public injury than the whole smcnt paid by the public'hi the shate of icresed rate of interest, It is clear, then, that the policy pumed by the banks is wile and thoroughly sound, beane it i the sure mode of guarding the pubUl andyroteocting trade nd mercantile credit from interruption. We trust that this 'wlI be distinotly understood aJI tlrough the country, because it will prevent all undue premure for accommodationx at the bnk There ae ample moans for all the legitimate, necessities of trade, and the bnhks are allowing such faib latitude in that reect that complete quiet and confidence prevail in this island, aflbrding a strking contrast with other oountries. We have ino- doubt Whsteverthbt this fortunate state of affairs WllM oontine, because the admirable conduct of the banks, aided by the good sense of the community and the prosperous eondition of the country, bas enabled us tocar7yon all the operatisna of mercantile enterprise and industrya 'voroly and as safelya if 2!ew York were g free fromn panic as Dubli or Cork. If the case were different-if fools rusbed in ' with greedy desire to possass money which they eould not require, and if through such means any extra preeure were created, the banks would be compelled to act on the defensive, and to limit accommodation to snch an extent that the consequenoes might be disastrous even to the partla whose rash conduct had caused all the evil. But fortunately there is not the least likelihood of sach an Interraption in the progress of Ireland in that courEe of acultal commerdu, and industrial advancement which has Ia rent yeas signalized her moving as steadily on towards pros. perity as any other country on the face of the globe." THE Lk3OUE-M31AIMM. One of the Belfast papers (the Banner) says :- "It is deeply to be regretted that, in consequenoe of the curtailment inmmanufacturing operations of almost every de. scription in Belfast, caused by the state of monetary afiirns, both in America and at home, numbers of skilled tradesmen are walking the streets withoutemployment, and others proceeding by every steamer to England and Scotland, where thelyprospects ofworkatpresentare bynosaeasenoouraging. The foundries and machine-.umers have discharged many of their hands, and placed others under notice to leave. Al1 other trades dependent on our Staple manufactures are, of course, suffering in proportionate degree; and it is stillmore melancholy to contemplate the vast number of needle. women left totally or partially without the means of earning a subsistence." Speaking of the state of the trade of Belfat generally, the d¢ercantile Journal says,- "Sofarthe stateof themoney-market has not affected the ativity of our trade, for the quays are crowded with vessel and goods, and the men are mere inclined to ask for increased harbour room than to assune that high dieounte wiU have any injurious effect. It is satisfactory to observe by the Board of Trade returns that the north of Ireland at the present moment is much less interested in monetary affairs with the Undted States tban usual, the export of linen goods having decreased 9,OOO,OO?yArds to that quarter during the last nine months as compared with theprovious FPB3IiSX PROSPEOrS R TiE WvsT. The report of one of the Mayo papers is not altogether as favourable as might have been expeeted& The Constitution of yesterday obeerves:- "1 The prospects which grceted farmers at the-close.of the harvest opeations and at the late principal fair has been sensibly aered witbin the past frtnight by the gloomy aspect of the American money and corn mamkete, the removal of the restrictions for importing corn in France, the depreciatio2 in the prices of home and foreign orn.; and the serions and heavy faUne in the mercatile oommunity, by which thousands of consumers are throwntoub of employment. We some time since venturd tho opinion that the corn-mtrkets were not likelytolmprorets opinion has, unfomunately, beta too truly realised, a& doubly so by the casualties which. threaten to. shake the: markets to their centre. Irish growm oats andwheat- have. suffered a further faill in Englih narket&s- and in. our home markets the highest pri realized for oats sold at the stores has been 6s. 4 per cowt.; and for wheat 11. 4d. per owt. It is an £xtraordlnarycl± stan oononected with the sales of produes that, although alld agree. that the potato crop is far below an average one in qqantity and quality, nevertheless a full sopply is to be-had in our markets at Sgures varying from 3d. to 3,Ld. per. stone. We can only account for the present price of potatoes-being' influenced by the reduced prlces-of corn and tho-absence of demand, and, as a consequence, the grain is not- being thrashed out, and small farmers resort to tho sale of potatoes to meet their pecuniary demands. The cattle-market has also received a sudden check, bnt not of' any mnoment;, yet prices have declined for all descriptions of stock, and as we before aserted, sheep have suffere4 a. decline, wool being almost a drag, and even at serious, reductions sales are not effected; and the want of employ. ment in the manufacturing distriotg of England will have a further effecot on the wool and, cattle markete Besidesthis, sregrdacattle, therestrictiontothe importation of foreign cattle has bee removed, no apprehension existing as to the cattle epidemic being conveyed to these shores.

FO}ZfIG2 INTBLEIa2NCE. FRANOE. rA por"Oi of tbX toloWing Sppered In our 0 tird bditVoa of vegterdav:-- (FROM OtY OWN COWMPONwDfT ±AUI§, Tt1UDAY, Nov. 10,' 6 P.Y. Tle Patrie appeared at a much later hour last night than usual, ancd with an article on the financial crisis which has much displeased the authorities. The consequence is that it has reeeived an official "warning. The Patrie Is one of the Minrterial class of journals, and in inflicting this correction the Government probably was anxious to show that, if there be not liberty of the press, there ls, at all events, equality. The following are the three measures of which the Patri4 recommends the simultaneous adoption, and which recommendation has occasioned the avertissement:- " 1. A forced circulation of bank-notes and the immae. diste issue of tho 50f. notes authoried by the law of the 23d June, 1857. 2. A high duty on the export of specie, with severe measures on the part of the Customs authorities and the police for the detection and puniahment of attemapts at fraud. 3. The immediate reduction of the rate of discounlt to 6 per cent. No persor would find caus for com. plaint in these measures. Commerce would be suppLied with abundant capital at the Bank; speculators in the precious metals would experience the greatert difficulty in exporting speCie which they could no longer obtain fron the Bank cellars. The Bank would preserve a specie reserve corresponding with the extension taken by its paper liue. Finaly, money would be maintained at a reasonable price for it is evident that it is not worth more than 6 per ce-t In France at the present moment; this is proved by the daily investments in railway bonds, which bear no higher Interest. Let these combined measures be adopted, and France will be respected by the storm, without her comn merce being affected or her prosperity diminished." It is atated in the I warning" that the Minister of the Interior considers the article as calculated to propagate ill-founded reports, and to injure public credit. It is certain that the financial difficulties have assumed a very serious aspect, so much so that it was considered urgent to convoke this day an extraordinary Council of Ministers at Compiegne, where the Court prolongs its festivities as if trade was flourishing and public confidence, political and financial, still undiminished. The Emperor predded at the Council, whose ordinary sittinf are held on Wednesdays and Saturdays. t was attended by the Director of the Bank of France and the Manager of the Credit Foncier. M. Abbatucci, Minister of Justice, is still in great danger. He received the last sacrament yesterday. His family have had an autograph letter from the Emperor expressive of his deep regret, and which, but for his absence, he would express in person, and the earnest hope of his recovery. The Minister's illness has given rise to rumours of new combinations. One is that M. Thouvenel wll be recalled from Constantinople5the English Government doing the same service by Lord Stratford) and appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs * that Al. Walewski will be Minister of State; M. Fould, of Finance; M. Billault, Justice; M. Rouland, Interior; MLarshel Vaillant, Public Instruction (for which post it is said he is well qualified); and Marshal Canrobert, War. M. Pietri, Prefect of Police, has been spoken of for the Interior; but as such an appomtment would be considered by the Prefect of the Seine as a personal slight, thesetwo functionaries dldiking each other in a most edifying way, M. Pietri will be left in the Rue de Jerusalem for the present. M. Adrien Feline has published an article in the Ioniteur Itdustriel on the monetary crisis, which he regards as transitory, such as occurs every five or six years, and which becomes more severe in proportion to the amount of business transacted. The present difficulty, M. Feline observes, has, as on former occasions, given rise to various demands for relief on the Government. The most remarkable are petitions from a number of merchants at Havre and the Chamber of Commerce In Paris. The former demands that bank-notes shall be declared a legal tender, by which means the Bank of France will be enabled to reduce its rate of interest. The petition from the Chamber of Commerce of Paris demands that the law of the year 18Y7, which linrtq the rate of interest to 6 per cent., shall be repealed, and that private bankers may thus enjoy the exclusive prvilege granted to the National Bank. M. Feline considers the petition from the merchants of Bavre as equivalent to demanding that the Bank of France shall be permitted to commit an act of bankruptcy, and, Btill worse, an act of fraudulent bankruptcy, inasmuch as it has at present in its cellars more than 200,000,000f. in gold and available securities. The example of 1848 Is adduced, but the petitioners forget that circumstances are not similar. In 1848 the Government was disorganized, universal mistrust prevailed, and it was impossible for either the Government or private individuals to meet their engagements. The difference, as M. Feline says, is immense. The revolution of 1848 was a national calamity, but a stoppage of the Bank of France at the present moment would be an act of dishonesty which would prevent French merchants who have bills to pay in foreign countries from taking them up. French paper money would not be received in those countries, and the French debtor must inevitably be ruined and dishonoured. M. Feline adds, that the Havre petitioners would be the first to suffer from the very remedy they recommend. He regards the petition of the Chamber of Commerce of Paris as just and reasonable. He remarks that, at a moment like the present, many wealthy capitalists wouldbe happy to ntilize the large sums unemployed in consequence of the law of 1807, which limits the rate of interest, and prevents them from making the most of their capitaL The repeal of the law of 1807 would be a satisfaction to the public, who cannot comprehend why that which is good and laudable on the part of the Bank of France is otherwise on the part of a private individual M. Feline concludes by recomimending that the law which prevents the Bank of France from lending money, except on a deposit of Government securities and railway shares, shall be repealed, and that that establishment shall in future be enabled to afford accommodation on aU deposits which offer real security. Some days since I noticed the fact of the Minister of State refusing to sanction the sale of a theatrical privilege, for the simple reason that such a concession necessarily imposed on the new management a ruinous burden. The theatre in question was one of the smaller places of amusement on the Boulevards, and if anything could justify such a transaction in favour of the family of the deceased manager; it would be the fact that by his intelligence and industry during 20 years he had left the theatre in a most flourishing condition. The decision of the Minister of State, which put an end to the system of buying anl seUing the privileges of a theatre-that is, of the signature of the Minister who grants the concessionwas warmly and generally approved by persons competent to judge of the case. This being avowedly the law laid down by the Minister in whose department these matters are, I am assured that there is no truth in a rumour which has been very industriously set afloat with regard to another theatre, aa Imperial one, in receipt of a large subvention in money from the State, and the sale of the privilege of which was said to be permitted, and for an enormous sum; and not only this, but that the period of the privilege was to be prolonged, with a view to facilitate the operation and enhance its value. The report has, I believe, found its way into some of the papers, but I am informed is completely unfounded, as it is absurd from its very injustice. The Minister of State has, in the instance alread quoted, given proot of sound judgment and strict Impartiality, and no one believes that a transaction which, irrespective of its great injustice, would certainly aggravate the aituation of the Imperial theatre in question, will be tolerated by him. It isi possible, or rather very probable, that there are parties wvho deem their influence irresistible in the highest quarters, and who would employ it againt the independent and just decision of the Minister. These persons may have their personal interests in view, and they may not remember that an act of private wrong often does more injury to a Government than one of public violence. A mysterious crime, bearing some affinity to the Waterloo-bridge tragedy, has just been discovered at Choisy-le-Roi. About 10 months ago a barrel arrived from Paris at the railway station, directed " Bureau-restant-Provisions." As no one has since come to claim it, orders were given the day before yesterday to the railway clerks to open it, when, to their horror, they found that it contained partofa female body completely dried up.

The Ost-Deutsche Post of thi morning contains the following - 'November 7th.-On this day a new and important consituent part has been added to the great edifioe of European international law. Lst week we announced that the Rlverain Commilson had oompleted its labour. relative to the freedom of the Danube, and would sign 'the Treats' (Traktat) as soon as the representative of the Porte had been authorized so to do. Yesterday the necevsary powerd arrived from Constntinople, and at 2 o'clock this afternoon all the members of the Commission met in the amsembly. room of the Palace of the Estates, where the great act for the navigaticn of the Danube was signed by the representa. tlves of the sovereign States." The Ost-Deutsche Post-the occasonal organ of the Foreign-office--expatiates at length on the "s disinterestedness" with which Austria has maintained the great principle of the freedom of the Danube, but it remains to be seen whether the Imperial Government deserves the enoomiums bestowed on it. The assurance has repeatedly been given me, that by the expression "' freedom of the Danube" Austria understands that all nations are to have the right to navigate the river from its source to its mouth, but all further information on the subject has been withheld, so that it is not known to me whether Austria and the other Riverain States intend to impose tolls or duties on the vessels passing up and down the Danube and its navigable branches and confluents. It is, however, probable that a small toll will be levied, nominally for keeping the beds of the rivers and the tow roads in order, but in reality for the maintenance of the "IHoheits-Rechte" (prerogatives of Monarchy) of the Riverain States. It does not appear worth while to Bay more on this subject at present, as the chances are that the great Powers will decline to consider the "1 Conveution" of the Riverain States as anythi ng more tban the draugbt of a law for the free navigation of the Danube. As has been said, it is.specifled in article 19 of the Treaty of Peace that the regulations for the navigation of the Danube must be settled " by common accord." It is not unlikely that the States lying on the Danube will represent to the great Powers that their Convention will make the Danube as free as the Rhine, Neckar, Maine, Moselle, Maus, and Scheldt; but the fact is, that the navigation of those rivers is less free than would be the case if the Powers had at the time insted on the exact fulfilment of those stipulations in the treaty of 1815 whlch bear reference to their navigation. As you were led to expect would be the case, the Fiener Zeitang has been obliged to explain the rmeaning of certain paragraphs of the Imperial ordinance relative to the imposition of a newspaper stamp. The sense of paragraph 5 is, that the postage of the papers must be paid as heretofore. The explanation given to an obscure paragraph relative to "advertisement sheets" is, that booksellers and other tradesmen who may print Hlts Df the goods which they have for sale will not be Dbllged to have them stamped. This is the sense Yenerally given to the explanation, but the style Af the offictal scribe is so very bad that the public may again have misunderstood what is meant. The Rungarians have resolved in future to subacribe only for those (Austrian) papers which are published in the Magyar language. The reason given by the Eungarians for this resolution is, that the Austrian Govgernment, by imposing such a heavy stamp duty, has rendered it impossible for them to take in papers written in a foreign language. It has alwrays been the aim of the Austrian authorities to make German popular in Hungary, but they have now furnishea the Magyars with an excellent excuse for altogether neglecting it. The day before yesterday you were told that the conflict between the Roman hierarchy and the Benedictine monks had begun, and It is now in my power to communicate some detailed information on the subject. On the 24th of October the Bishop of Linz, being deputed by Prince Schwarzenberg, theCardinal Archbishop of Prague,+ went to the great Convent of Molk, on the Danube. Immediately after his arrival the Prelate informed the inmates of the convent that he came as the representative of the deputy of Christ on earth, and as such expected that his commands would be implicitly obeyed. After having harangued the brethren publicy, he conversed with each of them privately for about an hour, and endeavoured to persuade them to sign a document by which they would pledge themselves strictly to observe the regulations of the oirder as laid down by its founder. After the first public harangue of the bigoted priest, there wras a general feeling of " indignation and disgust," and when he left, on the 30th (the "visitation" lasted seven days), the Benedictines felt as if a nightmare had been removed from their breasts. The poor old Abbot was subjected by the Bishop to an examination which lasted 12 hours. Great "inquisitorial" powers were displayed by the Bishop, who literally placed the minds of the inmates of Molk on the rack, but all his endeavoursto persuade them to sign the document were in vain. Before he left he gave orders that choral prayers should be offered up in the morning, and in the evening that the strictest "Klaustr" (claiusure)t should be observed, and religious books read after dinner and supper; and to such regulations the monks of course did not object. It is extremely difficult to acquire positive information on a subject of such delicacy, but it is whispered that the Bishop of Linz used language which would better have become a subject of Pius IX. than of Francis Joseph of Austria. On the 31st of October the Papal " visitor" went to the Benedictine convent at Gottweih. It may be observed, that as the Benedictines have no " general" at Rome, as have the Jesuits, Ligiorians, Dominicans, &c., they cannot be forced to send any part of the revenues of their estates to Rome. As has been said, the so-called reform of the convents is neither more nor less than a Roman " dodge" for abstracting the superfLuous cash of the Austrian monks from their coffers. The railroad from Szolnok to Debreezin, a distance of 82 English miles, will be opened on the 18th or 23d inst., asthe Emperor may determine. The stock of specie in the National Bank is 97,050,401l.; the bank-notes in circulation axe of the nominal value of 396,606,328fl. Information has to-day been given me that the Minister of Finances has again proposed to issue Treasury bills of the value of 100,000,000fl., and to withdraw bank-notes to the same amount from the circulation. On the 2d inst. Marshal Radetzky celebrated his 91st birthday. PRUSSIA. (FROtI OUR Oww CORRESPON-Dnr.) BERLIN, Nov. 9. The King has not as yet removed from Potsdam to Charlottenburg, and for the delay in this removal the chilly and cheerless weather is made re- 8ponsible, buit wvith very little reason. His Majesty was not strong enough till last Saturday to take his first exDerimental drive, which was prescribed by the physicians to be taken repeatedly, before they ventured on the long, drive from the one palace to the other. The report' was at one time current that it had been arranged to take the King down to the banks of the flavel in a sedan-chair, and thence to convey him up that river and the Spree, towed by a steamer, to the gardens of the Palace at X Chaottenburg; but, if that arrangement ever was made, it has been abandoned since, and the plan of driving along the ordiary country roads has been retained. To this end the roads have been specially repaired, as I have had occasion already to mention, - i-Lbe krince wM some time ago 3Dominated Vlidtor. Oeinera of the Auatrian con?eat b th~e Pp, 8ee. ±. Keeping females out of the COnLvent, clvaln of pates a,~ du*k &o and a variety of experiments have been made witna the various private carriages of the King and Queea to ascertain which travels tho lightest. Among other contrivances that have been resorted to for the purpose of diminishing all jerking and jolting of the vehicles has been the rsurrounding of the tires of the wheels with gutta percha and caoutchouc, which has in a great many cases been found to answer very well with the carSiages of private perons. On Saturday and Sunday the hg was, accompanied by the Queen, driven out once each day for half an hour at a time in the Queen's carriage, which, with its team of four grays, seems to have been ascertained to be the smoothest traveller of all. On each occasion the destination of the drive was the new buildings being executed at aud about the Palace of Sans Souci, many of which are very extensive and very elegant; and it is undersBtood that these drives have agreed very welr with His Majesty. It is hardly necessary that I should add another word on the subject of His Majesty's health. The circumstance that all I have to communicate confines itself to the information that a half-hour's drive has not done him any harm tells everything that I am unwilling to put down upon paper. The different attempts that are being made from time to time to entertain and interest him with aubjects of no exciting nature show that even these cannot be entered upon without detrimental effects to the bodily health of the Royal patient. In consequence of the King's continued residence in Potsdam, the Prince of Prusda has not yet come to reside in Berlin, and everything is going on as slowly and as quietly sa though everybody and everything had fallen as1leep; there is doubtless great activity going on somewlhere, but one gets to see nothing of it. One effect of the uncommunica tiveness of the local press on the subject of the King's health is, that the frivolous, cynical mind of the Berlin public of the worse classes. (T do not here mean necessarily the lower clase) is beginning to familiarize itself to the idea of his being dead already, and to cut and print their malevolent joker by anti cipatMon. BELGIU1.

T hear still from time to time of railway projects, but they remain projects. The line from Salerno to Taranto, in which the Paris house of Rothschild is said to be interested, still continues in that shady state. Some move is, however, to be made shortly to investigate the line, as Pauline Talabot is expected at the end of the month to go over it. The works are going on slowly between La Cava and Salerno, wbich will be the connecting bit between Naples and the Salerno Railways, but so slowly that the whole work seems intended as the Neapolitans would say, " per fare vedere." The Puglia Railway has not advanced one step beyond the stage of hope. It is hoped that His Majesty will compel all Uhareholders to pay up their arrears, and all who live on the projected line to purchase. AUl well-wishers of this co-ntry, too, hope that it will be constructed, for, under whatever aspect it be considered, a more promising line cannot be imagined. The country through which It would pass teems with natural wealth, which for want of a medium of communication is comparatively lost to man. Yet two years nearly have elased dince the King did (not) honour the laying down of the first tone by his presence, and all in stll doubt. It would be hypocrisy to disguise the truth,-railways are not desired by the ruling powers, otherwise a certain rate of interest would be guaranteed on the capital advanced. I regard that to be the touchstone of the sincerity of the Government, which willbe lavish of words, and promises,and smiles, knowing ful wel that no capitalist wiU be so mad asto invest his money inspecul tions in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies without guarantees, when he can get them with a higher rate of interest in any other part of the world. Railways, in short, are opposed to the present political and religious system. Railways will bring man and man together,-lead to discussion and union. The Neapolitan Government, on the con. trary, has both directly and indirectly isolated its subjects to such an extent that, like a cow tethered in the midst of its pasture, the provincial cannot go beyond the range of his property, nor the citizen go beyond the bounds of his province, even under the most favourable auspices, without his passport. Behind this political system, too, there is another power-the ecclesiastical power-which lives on the ignorance and degradation of the people, and dares not give its countenance and support to railways. If the north and the south and the east and the west met together in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the church would be reduced to its just proportions. Both the political and the religious system here in favour, then, requires the suppression of railways except for governmental purposes; and therefore guarantees are and will be refused, and thorns from the crown of Jesus Christ will continue to bleed, as the official journal lately informed u3 they had done. The eruption of the 20th ult. carried up with it the whole of the western cone, so that the shape of the mountain is now entirely changed.

THrE HAcxaEy CoAciExs op PAaRIs.-M. Pietri's decree re-establishing the old hackney carriage tariff, is prefaced by these very remarkable words, which must sound unpleasing to every reformer's ear, and are certainly far from complimentary to the inteligence of the citizens o- Paris:-" Considering that the system of paving for the use of carriages by the hour and the fraction of ar hour, although founded upon rational and equitable grounds, is contrary to the habits of the public, and that it is consequently desirable to put a stop to the complaints made agaist it; we therefore ecree," &c. So, because the Parisians have been in the habit of paying the same fare for going from oDe end of Paris to the other as they do for a five minutes' rlde into the next street the system Is to be perpetuated, the experiment of a more rational plan having demonstrated that in Paris absurd custom is stronger than reason and equity. I suspect, however, that the complaints of which the Prefect of Police speaks have proceeded mainly from the owners of the carriages, and not from the riding puLblic. I observed, when the now abolished tariff was first promulgated, that, taken as a whole it would be in favour of the fare, because the average of rides are for very short distances. The accuracy of this surmise is entirely borne out by the accounts of the company which farms all the carriages called peates voieures in Pais. Their receipts have diminished by several thousand francs a- month ever since the new rule was established. The present tariff is not purely and simply a reproduction of the old one. It is drawn with commendable care, and seems to provide for every possible case of a dispute between the driver and his fare. Various little privileges of a certain valne are accorded to the latter. He has a right to take a earriage by the course, and at any time afterwards to tell the coachman that he keeps him by the hour, and then the hour is to count from the time when the vehicle was hired. This rule wil prove a check to perversely slow driving. Again, where several persons ride together, one or more of theni have a right to get down while the other or others go on to their destination, without the course thera. fore counting as an hour. When a carriage is sent for t) take up at a house to go a course the coachman canno' charge for time unless more than ten minutes elapse from the time he is called off the stand to the moment when tha fare gets in. Luggage is to be charged for at the rate of 5 sous for each package, when there are not more than two, hut the coachman is bound to take as many more as the carriage will conveniently hold, without taking more thaa 10 sous. Carpet bags and other small parcels carried in the hand do not count as luggage. The Bois de Boulogne is no longer considered as within the walls of Paris for the purpose of reckoning the fare, and, moreover, the coachman, whea going there, has a right to rest 20 minutes. When an i where this right-which practically will result only in a debatable extracharge-is to be exercised is not define with the precision which is everywhere else remarkable in the decree, and this clause is likely to lead to difficulties. Tbe old night fares are re-established, ant night again begins at midnight, and not at half.past 12. It might have been thought that the watches placed in the carriages might be conveniently retained, because, although time is not now to be the exclusive measure of payment, carriages may be still taken by the hour. The decree, how. ever, declares with startling brevity that " the watches are suppressed." The reason perhaps is that since the etablhhment of the new system 59 watches have been tolen. The robberies were effected with so much dexterity that the vigilance of the drivers was in vain. The men re made to pay 45f. for each watch stolen.-ExPrcss

The principal businem ot our banking institutions just now is turning over, renevring, and arranging in different ways their protested paper The banks never grant extensions, but they renew paper either the whole or in part and keep it alive with all the additional security they can squeeze out of the makers or endorsera A good deal of this accommodation has been extended, and it appears to be the prevailing disposition, both Inside and outside the banks, togrant all the necesry facllties for a satisfactory adjustment. The California remittance of October is about duo, and will doubtless be at hand this week. This will givo us a milion and a qurter more at least, making an aggregate of two nmllion and a half dolars for the banks to report on next Monday.

She brings 2,484 ounces gold-dust, and 5561. in specie. Eer cargo includes 868 casks palm oil, 13 packages ivory, 50 ivory teeth, 70 bales moss, 22 bags cochineal, 189 boxes and 20 barrels oranges, 35 casks and 5 cases wine, and 27 packages. The sickly season has passed, and the coast is now tolerably healthy. An agricultural exhibition is to be held at Liberia in November. Two slave prizes are at anchor in Sierra Leone, one of which is marked " Alecto, No. 4." The trade is carried on with much activity, and chiefly under the American flag. Her Majesty's paddle-wheel steam-vessels Merlin, 6, and Pluto, 4, were at Sierra Leone. The Childers, 12, left on the 20th of October for a cruise. The steamsloop Alecto was at Fernando Po. The steamships Recla, 6, Hecate, 6, and Antelope, 3, were at Lagos. The steam-vessel Bloodhound, 3, Firefly, 4, and gun-vessel Teazer were off Whydah and Porto Novo. In consequence of the statement of a negro, who swam from an American ship, she was seized by the Bloodhound, but restored, after a satisfactory explanation at Sierra Leone. T'he screw-steamer Viscount Canning, eight days from Woolwich, had arrived at Teneriffe with 180 artiUerymen, and, after coaling, would proceed to India. The United States' steamship Susquehannah, Captain Sands, from the Mediterranean, had arrived at Madeira. The Royal mail steamship Gambia was 40 miles to the westward of Monrovia at 1 a.m. on the 16th of October. The Candace was spoken in lat. 30 27 N., long. 1634 W. The steamer Powerful was left at Accra on the 10th October, going down the coast. The St. George was at Sierra Leone preparing to return. The Durham was coaling in the Gambia, homeward bound. The Ethiope brings from Teneriffe a portion of the cargo of the wrecked steamer Niger, which continues to wash ashore. A strict quarantine is maintained at Madeira against all passengers from Lisbon during the last week. The Ethiope has experienced strong oontrary winds from the north.
PARI.1AMENTARY REFORBM MOVEMJtT.-A meeting, attended by, among others, MIr. Roebuck, ?l.P.; Sir Jonn Sbelley, A. P.; Mr. W. Williams, M.P.; YMr. Donald Nicholl, M.P.; hIr. Ayrton, h.LP.; h£r. Samuel Morley, and Mr. Edward Miasl, was held a few evenings ago at the Guildhall Coffeehouse, Gresham-street, in reference to the snhjeot of Parliamentary Reform. It appears that for some time past efforts have been made, and are still being made, by certain gentlemen in the metropolis, of whom it is believed the above-named are among the number, to ascertain by u. eans of correspondence the extent to which " advanced" Parliamentary reformers throughout the kiDgdomn can be induced to agree to the general outline of a measure for the amendment of our representative system. The mode of doing that has been, or is, tosubmit tothe known reformers in all parrs of the country a draught plan or programme of reform, to invite and collate their opinions upon it, and then to modify or remould the scheme, in the hope of securing for it the largest amount of concurrence and support. Having in this way found a common basis of operations, the intention is to make known the result in such a shape as may carry with it the united authority of the party. It I does not appear to be in contemplation to bring this before Parliament as a substantive measure, in opposition to or in the absence of any Bill emanating from the Government, but rather to unfurl it as "the banner"-to use the language of an organ of the party, or one in sympathy with the movemnent--" under vhichindividuals ofdiffering shades of opinion would be willing to enlist." In the event of Lord Palnnerstonintroducingaschemeof reform nextsession, they hope thus to bring the great body of reformers as much as possible into agreement on the general question. Their apologists, in reply to certain strictures in a part of the weekly metropolitan press on the mode in which they are moving in this matter, "deny that they are constracting any national organization, contemplating any noisy aRitation, or laying the plans for the accumulation of politioal influence." The meeting at the Guildhall Coffeehouse was strictly private, so that nothing is yet publicly known of the plan of reform the party is about to propound; but a weekly oontemporary, which professes to be in the secret, states that it proposes to confer a large extension of the suffrage on the owners and occupants, in part or whole, of premises kated for the relief of the poor; establishes the principle of secret voting on the Australian pLan, asd of trienilal Parliaments; abolislhes tbe property qualification of members; ad re-distribates the constituencies seas to give a majority of representatives to amajorlty of electb.s

NORrIS, M.P. This case, which occupied the Court on Monday aid Tuesday, was resumed to-day,iTheabill was filed against Mr. John Thomas Norris, the member for Abingdon, for setting aside a sae effected under a power for that purpose contained ir a mortgage from the late Mr. J. C. Roberton, in the yea of his two shares in the Paiiway Times. In 1838 Johboraithswaite, Joseph Clinton Robertson, John Whitehead and John EvaTs, established the Railway Timm, and by a deedndated in June, 183,it was agreed that they should he jointlT and equaly interested in the copyright, stock, and effects of and relating to that paper. By an indenture dated in July, 1839, Whitehbead,rwth the consent of Braithwaite and Evans, and in consideration of 500. paid to him by Joseph Clinton Robertson, assigned to Robertson his (Whitehead's) one-fourth sharedof th shaper. In November, 1840, Robertson assigned to John Thomas Norris, who wai then the printer of thhRailwayt he, his two fourth shares in that paper by way of mortgage for securing 500sl and interest, and themoitgate deed contained a power of sale. Robertson hav'ng made default in payment of 1501., part of the sum of 1b , Jo.n Thomas Norris in June, 1841, under the power of sale contained in the mortgago, aigned the two foerth parts or share of Robertson to his brother, James Norris, and the consideration for such assignment was stated in the deed of assignment to be 1,0001. In April, 1844, James Norris was registered as one of the proprietors of the Railway tbimes. The bill alleged that not money was ever paid by James Norris to his brother, the defendant, Johnhom Thoma Norris nt ougccsion oftheaforesaid sale, and that immediately thereupon the defendant entered into the receipt of the profits of Robertson's two fodrth shares, and applied the same to his own use, and that James Norris was in fact a trustee for the defendant ; and that even if there bad been an actual sale by the defendant to his brother, James Norris, of the before-mentioned two fourth parts or shas of Robertson, snub sale wa at a less price than could have been fairly obtained for them. Subsequently to the sale to James Norris, the defendant became the purchaser of the other two shares in the Railway TimOs which belonged to Braitwailte and Evans ; and ino 1 the defendant procured an assignment from James Norris of the two shares asigned by him to the latter. In 1852 Robertson died, and the plaintiff was his sole personal representh tive. The bill was filed in May, 1855. It was contended cn the defendant's behalf that the sae by him to James Norris of Robertson's two shares was bond llde, and that even if not bond fiide the plaintifs remedy was barred by acquxiescnene on the -part of Robertson, and length of time. Mr. Malims and Mr. Henry Stevens appeared for the plain'tiff- and Mr. Baton and Mr. Pliggott for the defeudamt. The VICE-CtAN-CELLOR said the queston was -whether the plaintiff had a right to redeem the shares which he had mortgaged in 1840. The defendant resisted the plaintiff's. claim to redeem on the grouLnd that he, in exercise of a power contained in that mortgage, effected a valid sale of these shares:' The defendant's case rested not merely onL his assertion of a complete and irredeemable title by sale, but he insisted that the plaintiff came to the court too late, and that it ought not to interfere with his (the defendant's) right even if the power of sale had ntot been properly executed. The case had been overloaded with a number of circumstances which it was unnecessry for him to advert to, and he would only touch on certain broad features established by the evidence. First there was the broad fact that the defendant, wrho was the mortgagee, insisted on a derivative title from the man to whomn he hadl sold. ThaLt was not enough to vitiate the sale, but still it was a remarkable circumstance. Another remarkable cirouinstance was that the person t-o whom the defendant sold, and through whom he now claimed, was his brother. This circumnstance also was not conclusive against the dlefendant, but still it was remaark-able. The evidence also showed that the power of sale had been exercisea for other purposes than for recovering the repayment of the mortgage mone y. That in itself was fata. It bad not hbee,i disgFsed that the power of ale had been uxerised veth view to expel Robertson from the partnership, on the alleged ground of his management not being satisfactory to the other partners.

Lord Car6igan, upon receiving this letter, had flledTi bill, and moved for an injunction againLst Major Lawrie rxz parte during the vacation. The injunction Wa gatedl restraining publication of the letters of which thL Ill t4ted that the defendant threatened and intended 1mraediate publication. To dianolve the injunction thus obtained the defendant now moved. Air. RoLT and Mr. AncrnnaiD Smr.rir, for the defendant, in support of the mnotion to dissolve, contended that he had never had the remotest intention of publishing the correspondence. The present motion was solely for the purpose ofvindlicatig his character and position as an officer and a gentleman. A grosser case of obtaining an ex parte injunction without a disclosure of the whole facts was seldom to be met with, and the injunction must not only he dissolv4d but diqs,olved with costs. Mr. W. M. JAimEs and Mr. FLm=IIG, for Lord Cardigan, clietinctly, us had beenL the case from the first, disclaimed having made the slightest imputation upon the defendant's character. At the same time he ought not to be per'snitted to hold this private correspondence still in his possession tie tes-'orirm over the head of Lord Casrdigan, nor was it ri~htthat he should constituate himself a judge of what wore prsvate and confidential commaunications. The VICE-CIIANCLLOR.o said that the injunctionx must bei distsolved and with costs, not merely upon the ground that tho whole facts had not boon disclosed upon the cz paric application, but upon the maerits of the Case-not that these letters were such as ouight to be disclosed and published, but that the defenidant had never made the threat of puxblishing them except upon one occasion 18 mnonths beck-, and then, that if something took place on the part of the plaintiff bhe should be obliged to produce them In cou t in his own defence. From that moment he had never had any intention of producing them. There might have been great haste and want of judgment in the letter of the 14th of February, 1856, written under irritation, and on the spur of the moment, but upon the anssver of Lord Cardigan the tbreat was at once withdrawn. From that moment he had deprecaktd anything of the sort deliberately and expressly, and it was only on the occasion of a most gross and dishcnourable charge made against him by Lord Cardigan cx partc to Colonel Shirley, a brother officer, that the matter had been revived. The charge was such as to convey to Colonel Shirley the impression that the defendant, without any provocation, was about to publish Lord Cardigan's private letters, and that, unexplained, his conduct was such as to render it inipossible for Colonel Shirley again to meet him on the footing of a gentleman. Upon receiving the defendant's etplanation Colodel Shirley came to the conclusion that his conduct was unimpeachable, and vwrote that he vsas quite satisfied that he never intended to make public the private communications of Lord Cardigan, nor bad ho threatened to do so unless under circumstances which would 'ave compelled hiu in self-defence to make use of them. He would rather, however, put the matter upon higher ground, and hold that no circumstances would have rendered such a course justifiable. All that was now attempted to be relied upon as justification (for the injunction for the correspondence of 18 months back was not now brought forward) was the letter of the 21st of August, 157, which was as plain and manifest a disclaimer of all intention to publish anything of the kind imputed to him art could well be imagined. Without entering at any length Into the early history of this unfortunate qArrel, in refor. ence to the action for salary the jury, upon the direction of the Chief Baron, found a verdict in fxvour of Major Lawrie, on the ground that he had been -plced under dcum - stances which rendered it Imposeible for him, asn a man of honour, to retain his position a gent.

At the last Spring Assizes held at Stafford the plaintiff In error was convicted before Mr. Justice Willes on an indictment which charged him with wilful and corrupt perjury. The perjury was assigned upon an affidavit sworn bv the defendant in support of an application for protection in insolvency, made to the County Coourt at Wolverhampton. Mr. M'MAHox was heard in support of the errors assigned, and contended that the indictment was bad because it did not appear that the insolvent had resided for six months within the jurisdiction of the oourt; and, consequently, it was not a judicial proceeding over which the Court had controL Lord CAMPBELL said, he thought the indictmentwhich set out the proceedings was suficient. It alleged that the petition was presented under the Act of Parliament. Mr. Sootland, who appeared in support of the indictMeat, was not called upon.-udgment a9firmed. TEE QUEN V. STANTON. In this case the naster of the steamship, the Berwick, had been convicted under the 376th section of the Merchants Shipping Act, 17th and 18th of Victoria cap. 104 for acting as pilot on board that vessel without elng dly licensed. The vessel traded to the Baltic, and carried pas. sengers, and the question was, whether, on leaving Graves. end, the master was bound to take on board a pilot licensed by the Trinity-house. By the 59th section of the 6th of George IV., cap. 125, the nasters of all ships havinD a British register,and trading, amrong other places, to theBaltic, were exempted from the obligation to take a pilot on board ; but by the Mlerchants Shipping Repeal Act, 1854, 17th and 18th of Victoria, cap. 120, the statute the 6th of George IV.. cap. 125, was repealed. By the 353d section of the Merchants Shipping Act all exemptions from compulsory piotage existing when the Act came into operation were to continue in force; but by the 379th section It was enacted that certain classes of ships, "w hen not carrying passengers," were to be exetpt, and among these were enumerated "ships trading to Boulogne, or to any place in E1urope north of Boulogne." Mr. T. W. SAtUNXBS contended that there was an inconsistency between the 353d and'. 379th sections, and that the latter sec.tion ought to be understood as restricting the tormer, and that, as the Berwick carried passeDgers, the conviction was correct;. Mr. H. HILL, Q.C., having been heard on the other side, Lord CAXPBELL said, the Court was asked to sav, by an implication which was by no means necessary, that the Act of Pariament creatod a new offence and imposed a penalty. It was admitted that by the 353d section the previous ex. emption was continued; but reliance was placed on the 379th section. The fair interpretation to be put on that section was, that, plus the exemption previously existing. the exemption was extended beyond wbat could be claimed under the previous Act. As an express exemption was given to this ship by the 353d section, it would zequire clear language to take It away; but no such language was shown. The other Judges were of the same opinion. Conviction affirmed. TUE QUEEN V. FLANACAN. In this caue George Planagan had been convicted under the 5th of George IV., cap. 83, sec. 3, as aa "idle and disorderly person" for neglecting or refusing to maintain his vife. It appeared from the facts set out in the conviction that the defendant had agreed to pay his wife 12s. a week for ber maintenance. The wife lived with her mother, but a the money was not paid, nor any portion of it, the defendant was summoned before the magistrates for neglecting or refusing to maintain his wife. When before the magis. trates the defendant expressed his readiness to take his vife home and to maintain her, bht the wife refused this offer, alleging as an excuse that onl a previous occasion her husband had assaulted her. The magistrates treated the defendant's neglect to pay for the maintenance of the wife as a refusal to maintain her, and convicted him accordingly. Mr. Bujss, Q.C., now contended that the conviction was good. Lord CAMIPBELL expremsed an opinion that the conviction was clearly bad. It was an attempt to procure a divorce, a vens! et thero, on the ground of cruelty, and to compel the defendant to pay alimonry. Mr. BLIss contended that the offer of the defendant to take his wife home was illusory, for he had no house of his own. His conduct amounted to a refusal to maintain his wife, and had been so treated by the magistrates. Lord CAMPBELL said, the Act of Parliament under which this conviction had been brought before the Court was a most benefidial one, for without it the Court could not have got at the merits of this conviction. There was no power to revise the decisions of justioes on a summary proceeding, they acting within their jurisdiction; and without this Act of zarliament there would have been no remedy. The facts showed that the defendant had made a promise to pay 12s. a week for the maintenance of his wife, but he had broken his promise. He asked her to come and live with him, and she refused. Mis conduct might have entitled her, to a divorce a mnssZ et ffr.o, and the husband might be liable to pay her Salmony. But the qustion here was, whether on these facts he ws guilty nder the Act of Parliament of wdlfully refusing to maintan his wife. His (Lord Campbell's) opinion was tha he was not. Under a statute of h9 ,1at ees4on, when an orderl in Coucil shall be tublished, to put it in force, a judicial Eeparation mig'it h3 obtained; but 5s the law now stands this cannot take place without a divorce a mens2 et thoro. All the rights of the marital tii existed in full force, notwithstanding the cruelty of the husband. The husband hxd not wDfuly refused to maintain his wife, as the magistrates supposed, for no past c- ruelty would justify her mn refusing to come to live with lhim. The applatlon was, therefore, wel founded, for there hadi been no wilful refusal to maintakin his wife, The other Judges wrere of the samne opinion. 31r. MILWVAED, who appeared for the defendant, applied Lord CAmpBELL-NO; no costs. Conviction quashed. (Sittngs at NUi Prius, at Guildhall, before Mr. Justice ERLE and Common Juries.) This was the first sitting in London for the present term. The list contained an entry of 21 causes, of which 19 were remanets; 3 were marked for speoial juries. SVALTBY, EXECUTOR, V. FLETCHER Mr. Macaulay and Mr. Clarke were counsel for the plin. tiff; Mr. Overend and Mr. Hawkins appeared for the de. fendant. The plaintiff sued as executor of the late Mr. William Maltby, of Brinsley, and the action was brought to reoover the sum of 2911. 16e. 4d., which it was alleged the defendant had received on his account. The defendant paid 1171, Ms. into court, and pleaded never indebted as to the rest of the demand. It appeared from the statement of counsel and the evidenoe of theplaintiff's witnesses that he is a farmer residing at Brinslev, in the county of Nottingham, whewre his late uncle, the testator, had also resided. The defendant (Mr. Wil1iam Henry Fletcher) is a sfurgeon practising at Rip ley, in the county of Derby, In the year 1831 the ilate MIr. MaItby had advanced a sum of 2C01. to a Mr. James Booth, which was secured by a joint bond of himself, MTr. Henry Wall, and Mrr. Samuel Booth. In 1854 the interest had fallen largely into arrear, and MIr. Mtaltby became very anxious about it. The defendant wras then attending him, and undertook to recover the money. On the 20th of Septemaber he paid MWr. Maitby a sum of 254. on account of tho interest, for which he got a receipt, and on the 5th of November he paid a further sum of 23.19s., for wzhich the plaintiff's wife gave a receipt in her uncle's name, and by his directions. A c.ouple of months after plaintiff discovered that defendant had received the principal of the bond, and taxed hima vrith it. iDefendant admitted the fact, but begged the plaintiff not to say anything about itthat it wrould be all right; and also said he had j,ust made a will for the old ma n very much in plaintiff's favour. From time to time the defendant, in answer to MIr. Maltby. sen., used to sa,y it was all right, and he would soon get the money. A fter ahout a year and a half plaintiff told his uncle the money had been paid. The old man taxed the Idefendant with having received it, but he made no answer. Mr. MIaltby died in February, 1867, and as no satisfactory settlement could be obtained this action was brought. It had been also discovered that defendaut bad received from MIr. Wall 261. more than w as due, wvhich he had since paid off by small instalments. For the defence the defendant himself was examined. HiS case WalS, that in August, 1S54, he happened to be attending Mtr. Wall when he received a letter from hlr. Briggs, an attorney, demanding payment of the bond. Mr. WalU, not being prepared, beg ged defendant to intercedo for him. Ho went to r. Matby, who was also a patient of his, and got authority to settle the matte-. He communicated with the parties, andltwasaaged that Mr.Wall should pa 1001. on account of the principal, and Mr. Samuel Booth the balance and the entire interest. Mr. Mdaltby became very anxious to Bet his interest, and the defendant suggested to Mz. Wall thst he had better pay 201. on account of it. Wall gave him 201., defendant advanced 51., and on the 20th of Septemnber paid 251. to MIr. MIaltby, and got a receipt. MIr. Wall subsequently paid 1001., which defendant; paid to MIr. Mbaltby on the 12th of October, and got A receipt for it. On the same day defendant bad a meeting with Mr. Cursham. MIr. Booth's *.ttorney, and got E check from; him for 1261?.16s. 8d., the ba lance due to Mr. hlaltby, and a further sum of 251. to repay Mr. Wall what he had advanced on account of the interest. Defendant got the check cashed, and on the 5th of November he paid Mr. MaItby 231. l9s. as the balance of the interest, and got a receipt signed by plaintiff's wife. Somse time before defendant had applied to Mr. Maltby to advan ce hinm 1001. on his note at 12 months' date. Mr. Maltby agreed to doso assoon as the bend was p aid off. In pur. suance of this agreement defendant kept hack the 1001. he bad received from MIr. Cursham. When he wvent to Mr. hlaltby's on the 5th of November he took a stamp and a copy of a note in his pocket, hut did not give it as the old man waa very much indisposed. The amount pDaid into court covered that loan and interest from the 12th of October, 1854. He had since paid off the 201. the balance |due to MIr. WalL During Mr. hlaltby's life hs often spoke to defendant of the loan of 1001., but never said anything |of a sum of 2001. being due. On cross-examination the defendant admitted that on the 16th of August, 1854, he received 1201. from MIr. Wail but did not pay over a penny to Mr. M{altby until the 20th His LonnSm? in summing up said, that the question for the jury v- , whether or not the defendant had paid 1001. on the 12th of October as he alleged; if they believed the defendant's story they wvould find for him, if not they ought to findfor the plaintiff. The j ury then retired, and after a short absence retur-ned a verdicti for the plaintiff-damages 1001.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. Wrn-qm;sr; NrV 11 (Si!tings in Banwo.) TlIds Court to-day did not sit, the learned judges being engaged in the Court of Error, in the Exchequer Chamber. (SiUingse t Nisi Prius, at GuildhaZl, before lfr. JudicX CREsswxuL. and a Comnmn Jury.) This was the first sittings at N*iei Prium for London in Michaelmas Term. MACRA'E A?D ANOTHER V. SUGA'S AND ANOTHER, 11r. Lush, Q.C., and Mr. Atktnson appeared for the plantiff; and Mr. O'Malley, Q.C., and Mr. Keene were counsel for the defendants. This was an action brought to recover the balance of an account due under the foUowing circumstances:-In the month of February, 185A, the ship John Baears, of which the defendants were owners, arrived in ballast at Rangoon. Doyle, the captain, paid off the men, and commissioned the p]aintlff to obtain a fresh crew. This they did at Calcutta, but the Lascars, of which such crew was composed, not having arrived at Rangoon before the 5th of April, Doyle, who in the meantime had got togetber what one of the witnesses called "a sort of a crew," sailed, leaving the plaintiffs to dispose of their crew (which pre. sented itself at Rangoon on that very day) to the best advantage, stating that, according to his calculations, the course he had adopted would prove more beneficial to his owners than any other, the men to be farnished by the plaintiffs having arrived so late, and he (the captain) rLot knowfng when they would arrive. He also said tnat any balance which might be due to the plaintiffs on the transaction would be paid by the defendants. The case for the plaintiffs was that they had been instructed to furnish a crew with aU due diligence ; that they had got one together; but that, owing to the facts that after the men had been procured at Calcutta, one steamer was unable to forward them, being occupied by convicts, and another steamer was in a similar predicament from having troops aboard, they had been obliged to wait for a longer time than they otherwise should have been before they were in a position to send them to Rangoon, but that they had done all that under the circumstances they were able to do, and had ised, in fact, due diligence. Having got rid of the useless Lascars as well as they could, they urged that they were now entitled to a balance for money paid to them for their passage, for clothes, and for other contingent expenses, of 1341. 4s. 8d. For the defendants it was contended that the contract was that the plaintifr, should furnish a crew by the timne the ship was bound to sail according to her charter-party, and the greater portion of the plaintiffs' case was contradicted by the captain, Doyle, who was brought up in custody to give his evidence, he having been convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for having assaulted aboard his vessel a boy, who it was said had been driven by illusage to commit suicide. The jury found a v4erd8ict forthdeplaintis afor the amount clamedviz, 141.4s.Sd. inludng nteestafter the rate of 12 per cent., according to the custom of India in cases where advances are made.
I COURT OF EXCHEQTJER. WEDNESDAV. NAV. 19 I -- - CROSS V. SBTRLEY. (Siings at Nisi Prius, at Guildky44 before Mr. Baron MAURTIN and Com 1 , I Mr. 'emple and air. Lewis appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. 3f. Chambers and Mr. Barstow represented the de. fendant. The declaration in this case set forth that the plaintiff had entered into the defendant's service as huntsman under an agreement that the defendant should pay the plaintiff at the rate of 51. per month, with food, clothing, and lodging, and a passage to and from Turkey, where he was to take the defendantps hounds. It then stated that the defendant had not fulfilled his agreement, and that he was indebted to tbe plaintiff in the sum of 1561., which was now sought to be recovered. The defendant pleaded that he had fulfilled his agreement, and that he had offered the plaintiff a free passae home, whioh the plaintiff refused, it appeared that a Mr. E. Tattersal, on behalf of the de. defendant, Colonel Shirley, who was the commanxder of the cavalry in the Trkish Cointingent, entered into the agres. ment alleged in the declaration with the plaintiff. The plalntiff went over to Turkey with the defendant's hounds, and took care of them for some months. In July, 1856, the hounds were sold, and shortly after the defendant left Turkey, according to the plaintiff's case, without paying him his wages or supplying him with a passage home. The plaintiff was thus left in a foreign country without means. and he thereby endured great distress. Ee fiually mana ;ed to get a passage home by taking care of some horses for a gentleman who was returning to England. On his arrival in England he commenoed the present action. The following evidence was given in support of the plaintiff's case:- Charles Cross.-I am the plaintiff in this action. In December, 1855, I became acquainted with Ur. R. Tattersal. Through Mr. Tattersal I entred into that agreement with the defeudant. (The agreement was handed to witness.) On the 5th of January. 1856. I took the hounds down to Deptford. I had received 101. at that time from Mr. TattersaL I took the hounds on board a vessel. The vessel sailed, and we arrived at Constantinople on the 11th of February, I called upon the defendant and he gave me 41., which made 141. that I received altogether. I took the hounds, by the defendant's orders, to a place about 30 mrUes from Constantinople. I attended to the hounds until the Sth of July. During a portion of that time the defendant hunted the hounds frequently. On the 19th of May the defendant left for Constantinople. I continued taking care of the hounds. On the 28th of May I received a communi. cation from the defendant stating that he had sold the hounds, and that he hoped to geb a passage home for mue with the houds. I received 51. 15s. 6d. from a Mr. Sperling, whowasthe defendant'sagent. He broughtordersfor me to stay there with the hounds. I have charged for everything that I paid for in my bilL. I have charged for several itemi fiamy own clothing which I wore out in the defendant's rervice. On the 5th of July the hounds were sold to a Mr. Whittle. I was told to take the hounds to Mr. Whittle's place, four miles the other side of Constantinople. I took the hounds and delivered them safely on the 11th of July. I remained with Mr. Whittle for four wveeks with Sperling's consent. I tried to get a passage home, but I could nob obtain one. When I left Mir. Whittle I returned to Constantinople,when I found that Colonel Shirley had left Constantinople, and bad left no directions for me. I had no money, and my friends were obliged to assist me. I asked Mlgjor Brett to take me home with him, but he did not take me. At last a Mr. Ware offered me a passage if I would take care of two horses on the voyage for him. I sailed with the horses on the 11th of May, 1857. When I arrived in England I consulted an attorney as to the course I should adopt. Cross-examined.-I received 241. altogether on the defendant's account. I was in the hoapital for five weeks while I was in Turkey. Somebody else must have attended to the hounds while I was in the hospital. Colonel Shirley told me he had been obliged to pay another man for doing my duty while I was ill. I heard Eomething about Sir Stephen Lakeman buying the hoands. Before Colonel Shirley left he did not ofler me a passage home. I did not say that I would rather stay where I was. I was obliged to borrow money from friends to subsist upon. I had no disp ute with Mr. Whittle before I left him. Ee sold the houndsato another gentlemnan. I did not ampply to the other gentleman to be engaged as huntaman. Mr. Whittle paid mne 18L. while I was vwith him. He made no agreement with me as to what he should pay me. Major Brett never offered me a passage home. Captain Murray was Major Brett's assistant. I will not swear that he did not offer me a passage home. I first of all made a claim against Mr. TattersaL I tried all I could to get work. Re-examined.-I asked Major Brett to give me a passage bome, and he refused me one. I then applied to Captam Murray, and he told me he would give me one and make Colonel Shirley pay for it, and he took my agreement as security. He told me one day at 2 o'clooc that a vessel would start at 4 o'clock, and that I could go by it. I had to go some distance to get my clothes, :id therefore I could not go by it. A judge's order to examine Mr. Sperling, Colonel Shirley's agent in Turkey, was then put in. Mr. AL CHAMBERS, in stating the caes for the defendant, said it was clear that this was an attempt at extortion. Although ColonelShirley was not obliged to pay the plaintiff any wages during his stay in the hospital, be would not re- pay the amount claimed for wages during that period. It would come eventually to a question of amount. The defendant bad offered to give the plaintiff a free pas sage home, but the plaintiff said he should prefer remaining where he wag. Underthese circumstances the defendant had fulfilled his part of the contract; and, although the verdict must be in favour of the plaintiff, he trusted that it would be but for a small amount. He contended that the plaintiff; having received notice that the hounds were sold was a sufficient notice of a termination of the agreement. The following evidence was given on behalf of the defendant:- Colonel Shirley.-I am the defendant. I had the cam mand of the cavalry at Constantinople. The agreement with the plaintiff was made through Mr. Tattersall. In the month of ay theTurkish Contingent was ordered to be broken up. As soon as I knew that I spoke to Cross myself and gave hlm the option of coming home with me with myother servants, or of remaining where be was. He said he would rather remain where he was, and he begged me to get him a situation there. Sir Stephen Lakeman was in treaty with me about the hounds, but the negotiation was broken off. I agreed to let him have the plaintiff without the hounds. Before I left I authorized Sperling, who was my major domo te settle with the plaintiff. I anthorized him to pay bim bl. 15s. 6d., which I considered was all I owed him. I never received any communication from the plaintiff from that time until I was served with a writ. Cross-examined.-The paintiffsaid he would remain Hf I could get him employment. The impression upon my mind was that he wished to stay under any circumstances. Mr. Tartersal recollected engaging the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant. He sent the plaintiff to an outfitter's to get some clothes, whieh were placed to Colonel Shirley's account. Mr. Mf. CuAmBZRs having summed up, Mr. TEs1rLE replied upon the whole case. Mr. Baron MARTIN, in summing up, said that It was admitted by the defendant that the only question for the jury to decide was as to the amount due to the plainti f t would entirely depend upon the time when the service terminated. Agrments of this sort were usually determined by a notioe of a month. It was contended by the defendant that the plaintiff being told that the hounds were sold was a sufficientnotSce. There was another period when the agree- I ment might have terminated, which was when he was i offered to be hrought home by Colonel Shirley. Upon this point, however, t8ere was a direct contradiction between the parties, and it would be for the jury to determine the question as to whether or not there had been an offer ef a paslsage. They must look at the whole of the case and say to what amount in their opinion the plaintiff was entitled. TthtejuFry,afterf ashortconsideration, returned a verdict

PREROGATWE COURT. WEDNlxsnAy. Nnv 1i 1,AVS Y. LANE AlND GRITFI.HS. (Before Sir J. DoDsOS.) mJs was a suis promosea Dy unaries Lane, one of the sons of Catherine Lane and her sole executor under a will of the 17th of September, 1851, against his brother, Henry Warden Lane, and Mr. Griffiths, the executors of Cathe. rine Lane, under a 'will of the 13th of October, 1855. By the former wil ths testatrix bequeathed nearly the whole of her property to her eldest son Charles, and by the latter will it was left to Henry, a younger son. It appeared from the pleadings and the evidence laid beforethe Court on either side that the testatrix was a wvidow carrying on business as a plumber and glazier at Chipping Wycombe, in Gloce8tershire; that she dhd on the 29th of October, 1855, at the age of 62, leaving four children, and that at the time of her death sbe was possessed of personal property to the amount of 5004 and freehold property of the value of 3501., subject to a mortgage of 2001. On the part of Charles Lane it was alleged that in April, 1854, the deceased had a convulsive fit which impaired her mental powers, and from the effects of which she never recovered; that in the course of the year she expressed adesire to make a will, and that she was allowed to do so in order to humour her, hut that she afterwards destroyed it; that she had another fit in December, 1854, and on the 30th of that month was alloweed to make another will, althoughtherewas no intentionthat it should becarriedinto effect; that after her convulsive attacks her memory almost entirely failed her, she was unable to conduct her busines , and she endeavoured on one occasion to commit suicide that when her brother committed suicide in June, 1855, sho appeared wholly unaffected by the event; and that during 1854 and 1855 she was wholly incapable of making a will, and the signature to the will of 1855 had been obtained by undue influence. In support of the will of 1855 it was asserted that the fits by which the deceased was attacked were of a rheumatic nature; that in the intervals between the fits sho managed her business, she attended public worship, she once acted as sponsor at the baptism of an infant, and she was perfectly capable of executing a will; that she never attempted to commit suicide; that the wills of 1854 were not made merely for the purpose of humouring the deceased, but with the full intention of being carried into effect; that previous to the execution of the will of 1853 she had violent quarrels with Charles Lane, and changed her residence from his house to that of Henry Warden Lane, and that she was of perfectly sound mind at the time of the execution of that will. Dr. P LIMiwORE, who appeared in support of the will of 1855, called the attention of the Court o the evidence of the managing clerk to the solicitor who had drawn up the will, and who had known the deceased for many years, and of other disinterested witnesses, for the purpose of showing that she was of testamentary capacity up to the time of her death; that Charles Lane had never expressed any doubts of her sanity in 1854 and 1855,; and that she had a motive for changing her mind as to the disposition of her property in the improper behaviour of Charles Lane. Dr. ADDAMS, on behalf of Mr. Charles Lane, contended that, all the aots of the deceased untI within a few 'weeks of her death having manifested the intention of leaving her property to Charles Lane, with whom she had been residing, and who had managed her business and behaved in every respect like a dutiful son, the Court would not give effect to a will executed under circumstances of suspicion, and making a totally different disposition of her property, no good reason being assigned for such an entire change of feeling on her part as was indicated by the wilL The will of 1854, whioh was, like that of 1851, in favour of Charles Lane, might in his opinion have been supported, but as it was not before the Court, he submitted that probate should be granted on the will of 1851, which was executed at a time when the deceased was undoubtedly of sound mind. The evidence before the Court clearly estsblished the fact of her insanity in September, 1855. Dr. PHLiLmmoRE having been heard in reply The learned JUDGB took time to consider his decision,
COUBRT OF BAffRUPTC= BasinghaU-strec4 Rov. IL _ IN Rll SYERS. WALKERL AND SYER (Bcfore Mr. Commi,, Gnr O r.Trttm- i "O. a ru were merclunts of London and Liverpool. Their accounbt and all the principal facts in the case have already appered in A-e iTimes. It is safficient here to state that the capital was inconsiderable (a vouched sarplus on the 1st January, 1854, of about 4 0001.), and that after trading to the amount of a million sterling the debts proved are 135,0001., the amount proveable about 190,U001., and that the estate is expected to pay 2s. In the pound. Thi was the certificate meeting. Mr. Linklater appeared for the a5ssnees; hlr. Lawrance for Mr. Warner, a creditor Mr. FPo"okor acreditor; Mr. Bagley and.Mx.Roxblrgh for the bankrupts. Mr. LUMcA.Tims, for the assignees, said, thaLt up to about the middle of 18 the bankruptBshad carried on a imoderate and legitimate trade. About that time, influenced by the extravagant expectations of pce or war, they had embarked in transactions far beyond their means. The transactions were in fact a mere speculation, certLain ruin staring them in the face if they were unsuccessful, and the prospect before them of great wealth and being applauided as deserving gentlemen if they prospered. They obtaied advances upon goods-a practice which, although a very general one, was thought by some to be a practicee mnore honoured in the breach than in the observance. HAving regard to the long time the bankrpts had beeut before the Cowrt (since may, 1856), and the get vexation and annoyance they had undergone, the assignees were willing that the bankrupt should now receive second-class certificates. Mr. L&wzrR"cH characterized the trading as mostreioless atd Tirovdent. With a capital of 4,0001. the transactions r hd be 1,000,0001. The losses, giving the bankrupts credit for all their profits, bad been from l50,0001. to 60,0001., and the persnal expenditare of one of the lyers bad been at the rate of 2000. a-year. There were some psns who thought that a man was at iberty to re late plexpenditure dy the extent of his transactions. There were others, however, who thought that they ought to eanr some proportion to their profits. The systematic couhei of obtaining admvanoes upon goods before they had been paid for was a most mischievous and rtinous practice, however general. It would be a slander upon British merchlSts to put these bankrupts, however eoxnsive their transactions, in that class To cal things by their right names, the bankrApts hadf pl3dgedO and pawned goods to an eniormouas amount. 'What would be said of a Danper who, hav 0one to a wholesale house and purchased a paorEl of 9goods went immediately ana pledged the goods under the erm of obtaining advances ? Htowever fine a term might be used, it was stfi pawning. Accommodation bills were now being distinguished in the city by themore pleadng term of " finance bills," ut all thin refinement of t hers did not alter the charater of trnctions The whole amount of the bankruPts capital had been absorbed In the drawings of norris fyers (4,2281.), while the drawings of Daniel Syers hba been 1,90. The bankrupts stoppd on the 4th of Apri. On the Ist of April Morris Syers drew a check for 2L, and on the 3d of April for 3751. On the latter day Daniel hlyers also drew a check for 3751. This withdrawal of aE gsm of 900a from the estate was most unjustifiable. He did not complain of Mr. Linkyater being so far satisfied with the conduct of the bankrupts (who were old cients) as to assent to their receiving second-cbs certificates, but the creditor he represented took a different view of the merits of the case. Mr. PooR comr lained that the bankrupts had purchased of r. arwg 701.worh o ti pltesshortly before their shebankruptcy, beae the artie wsto tone which they could rheadily paw. Athe bankrupt,he skalleged, had sold Mr. OXB1tG sad, h shuldexainethe opposing Mr. Warner, having made his affirmation as a member of the Soiety of Friends. said, that he had called upon the bankrupts abott 8 o'clock of the evening of the day on which they had suspended payment. He saw Mor. Se tyers, and told him that he had a quantity of iron in the iver about to be shipped, nd a quntity of zinc on the Thames -which ha been shipped. The zinc was on board, and he was deraus of ascertaining whether the iro and the zinc could become his p-rperty The goodb hadibeen shippel for the bankrupto, and he whed to so them if possible and have.the W aruer- cAt the inte i w he spoke gennerally of the stoppagye.

His object in going was to try to obtain his goods. Hr. RoxuRGH.-Did you not on that occa on, in the presence of Mr. D. Syers, ask Mr. M. flyers whether he had not something-anthig--some hills of lading or something, for you did not know what to do your loss would be so large? Ifr. W amer.-I cmnnotsay whether it was in the presence ofMr. Daniel dlyers, but Iam gulte sure I said everythizg I poplibly could to get powmeon of those two shipments. The iron had not been shipped, and I thought that the zinc might not he shipped-that the bil of lading might not have been hypothecated or pawned. I cannot atnswer the questIon in any other way. Mr. RoxBunGiL-Did not youa ask the bankrupt to give you a bill of lading or something of that sort? Mr. Warner.-I cannot sdy more than I have.

I IAVSOL VENT DEBTORS' CO UBT, Nov. 11. IN RE LIZZABETHMARTM A TrATT (Befeo M74 Inmm ,,,,,,,, This insolvent, a young lady, better known to the musical world as MissDyer, petitioned under the Protection Act. Mr. Dowvsz supported .1dr. SARGOOD appeared on behalfof Mr. Kingsbury to oppose, and stated that his client had brought an action against the insolvent for breach of a contract, whereby she bound herself for three years, in consideration of Mr. Kingsbury completing her musical education and Providing her with board and lodging, to divide with him the profits of any engagement she might have. During the progress of the action Miss Dyer married Mr. Henry Haigh, also a well known vocalist; but the action was continued against her solely, and finally was decided in the plaintiffs favour, who was awarded 201. damages-his costs being taxed at 721. The learned counsel submitted that the insolvent's petition could not be sustained, as she, being a married woman, without separate property, could, if arrested, obtain her discharge without the intervention of this Court upon ap. plication to a judge, and referred to several cases quoted in Macraes Insolvency Practice, second edition, in support of that view. Mr. Dowsu coatended that the petition was a proper one, snd referred to the case of Louisa Armitage, in Mr. Macrae's book, as justifying that position. The learned COcSSIwO.ER said, he thought he was bound to entertain the petition. The action had been commenced, oontinued, and ended in the maiden namne of the defendant, although the plaintiff, under the 141st section of the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852, might have joined the husband in the action or judgmnent. That being Eo, it was not because in the event of being arrested the insolvent could be discharged by some other court, therefore she could not petition this court. The 4th of Decemaber was named for the final order, any question upon the merits being reserved for that occasion. IN RE SHEPHERD SIMPSON. This insolvent, an elderly man, petitioned for protection. Mr. SARGOOD appeared for the trustee of the insolvent's wife, from whom ae was separated, and to whom he had undertaken by deed to pay a weekly sum of 20s.

It appeared from the evidence that on the previous evening prosecutrix missed a pioce of silk velvet from an upstairs room, and accused the prisoner the next morning (yesterday), when she denied all knowledge of the article alleged to have been stolen. Mr. Chatterton, the husband of proEecutrix, told her that he should go to the station and fetch a constable, and left home for that purpose, Aelling her that he mnst have her boxes examined. He shortly afterwards returned with the constable, Parsons, and it was then ascertained that prisoner had absconded. He (the officer), accompanied by Mr. Chatterton, went in search of her, and, meeting her in Grove-road, St. John's-wood, took her into custody. She was taken hack to the bouse, and on her boxes being opened, to which proceeding she did not object, articles of different descriptions, consisting of towels, handkerchiefs, sheets, &c., belonging to Mrs. Chatterton, were discovered therein. They were pro. duced and identified. Parsons, in addition to the articles enumerated above, produced a gold watch, with gold chain, seal, and ring, which be took from one of the boxes, and the prisoner, when the discovery of them was made, alleged that they were her own. *The articles alluded to were not the property of Mr. Chatterton.

When Mr. Snelgrove interfered he was set upon by the whole of the prisoners, and was much besten about by them, Sergeant Brennan was then called and was also knooked about, and when the other constables came up, they followed the prisoners into one of the houses, whenthe door was shut, and a regular Sght took place. The prisoners seeing shuttergstanding inthe passage, tookthemup and threw them at the police, and in the scuffle one of the constables' hats was knocked off and rendered quite unfit for fuQrther use. Mr. TvRnwHr fined the woman 4G or one month for the assault on Mr. Snelgrove, and 20s. or 14 days for the assault on the police; Stelfox, 40s. or one month - Matthew Spurgeon, 20g. or 14 days for the assault, and 14s. or 10 days for the damage to the sergeant's hat; and the other lOs. or 14 days' hard labour in the House of Correction. The prisoners were then looked up in default. WA.nWswoxTn.-Mr. William Watling, the extensive pork pie manufacturer and provision merchant of Pimrlco, was summoned before Mr. INzOHAM, at the instance of the Wandsworth district board of works, for having caused a nuisance at his piggery, in the York-road, Battersea-fields, by the boilmig o stle pork ie. Mr. Corsellls, the clerk ofthe board, stated that this was a proceeding to prevent a recurrence of the nuisance, which was likely to occur daily. His instructions were that the nuisance was caused by the boiling of the stale pork pies to fatten the pigs Mr. Duncombe, who appeared for the defendaut, said that statement was not correct, and he could prove that, notwithstading Mr. Watling's extensive trade, on an average not more than eight pork pies per day were thrown into the hog tub. These pies were highly flavoured and patronized by nearly all the licensed victuaDlers, and tbhrefore when they were broken up and boUed with the other food for the pigs It was not likelv that it would cause such a nuisance as complained of. The defendant kept a great many pigs, and his premises were at least 100 yards from any dweling. He dented positively that any nuisance existed. Dr. Connor, the medical officer of health for the sub. division of Battersea, said on one occasion he experienced a most offensive smel, which he traced to the defendant's premises. Ie was in the habit of passing the premises daily, and only experienced that offensive smeU ou one occasion. He spoke to Mr. Watling. who expressed hls wiDingness to do anything that vwould obviate the eviL Mr. Duncombe said, according to the sucestion of the medical gentleman, his client had placed ahood over the large copper, with a shaft to carry off the smelL Dr. Connor said be afterwards recommended that the bood should be placed much lower and the shaft considerably higher. Ie hadnevertastedMr. Watling's pies. Mr. Young, the surveyor of the board, and also the inspector of nussauceg,spoke tohavingexperienced the offensive smell on two or three occasions. He also stated that the neighbours had complained. The surveyor said the smell was much more offensive outside than It was in. He had the lid taken off, and saw that the food consisted of materials such as were used in pork pies. The foreman told him that the pies were boiled to extract the fat. He liked Mr. Watlng'' ples. Mr. INOGrAI thought the evidence was very slight, and recommended an adjournment of the summons for the parties to come to an arrangement. The officers did not comnplain of Mr Watling as a manufacturer of pies, but of his boiling them for food for the Pigs. The snmmons was accordingly adjourned, Mr. Duncombo statingthat there was nO doubt his Worship would not hear any more of the case. Henry Zacharia Jarvis, who represented himself to be a colioltor, was brought before Mr. TIGHAM. on remand from thq previous day, charged with obtaining money by fraud from Mrs. Sarah Parker, sa elderly lady, who was alleged to be insane. It will be remembered that the prisorner was remanded at his own request, in consequence of his solicitor not being present, he understanding that the case would be heard on Wednesday, instead of Tuesday. A gentleman from the Law Society attended in consequence of an application from his worship, and stated that It was not usual for the society to prosecute in cases where individuals falsely represented tbemselves to be solicitors, but he had attended for the purpose of watching the proceedings and reporting to the society. Mr. Ambrose Haynes, solicitor, of Wandsworth, now attended for the prisoner, and requested that the whole of the evidence might be read over. Mr. A. Taylor, the chief clerk, then proceeded to read the evidence of the several witnesses, the substance of which has already appeared. Mr. Haynes cross-examined them at some length, but failed to shake their testimony. LIr. INOHAse again remanded the prisoner untiU Monday for the production of other evidence; and the wforthy Magistrate intimated his intention of completing the depositions on Tuesdar, with a view of committing the prisoner for triaL ._ _ _ _ _

THE CLEZGY D THE DivoRcF ACT.-An address to the Queen is now in course of signature among the clergy in various parts of the provinces, representing the painful position in which they are placed by the Divorce and Maftimonial Causes Act, and the restraint it imposes on their conscienoes. They state that the Act contains provisions in direct conflict with the Act of Uniformlty, and that there is no word, either in the form of solemnization of matrimony prescribed by the Book of Common Prayer, or in any other of the formularies of the Church of England, to show or sugest that it has been at any time the judgment of the Church that marriage, once lawfully contracted, is dissolvable except by death. They add that the Act of 'Uniformity binds every beneficed clergyman to "declare, openly and publicly before the congregation, his unfeigned assent and consent to the use of all tbings contained and prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer, and to use the morning prayer, evening prayer, celebration and administration of both the sacraments, and all other tho public and common prayer in such order and form as is mentioned in the said book," They contend, therefore, that the Divorce Act has indirectly repealed a material portion of the Act of 'Uniformity, wilch is the legal and constitutional basis of the public ministrations of the Church of England. This precedent, they say, is most aarrming, inasmuch as it is manifest that If the principle of repealing any materl portionof the Act of Uniformity indirectly aud by imphcation be once admnitted the plain meaning of the Prayer Book may be nuUified, and its express directions imperceptibly abrogated, in so far as the statntable obligatiOn of these is concerned, and that fundamental altrations may be thereby effected in the relations of the Church to the State without the attention of the laity Or clergy having been awak-ened to the legislative process by whichsuchalterationsshalhavebeenmade. Theystate,more. over, that the indirect repeal of the material portion in question of the Act of Uniformity by the Divorce Act is accompanied by a circumstance without parallel, as they conoeive, in the legislation which has hitherto affected the United Church of England and Treland-nsmely, the exemption of one portion of that IUnited Church from the operation of the Divorce Act, which has been carefully framed so as to leave the Church of ireland unaffected by its provisions; that thelIUnited Church is, therefore, disunited in respect of a material point by the Act in question inasmuch as in Ireland marriage remains indissolvable by tie general law, while in England It has became dissolvable. They addl that the Act cannot come into operation exoept upon or after the 1st of January next, by an order of the Queen ln Coancil; and they pray that Her MaLjesty will be graoionsly pleased to withhold such order until time shall have been given for Parliament so to amend the Act that the confusion, inconvenience, and scandal which must arise from a state of the law oontradictory to itself may be avoided; and that, in the event of Parliament seeing fit to abide by so much of the Act as provides by process of law for the dissolution, vinctdo, of marriages lawfully contracted, care at least be taken that, whatever the Legislature may enact concerning the dissolution of the civil contract, no violence be done to the plain language of the Prayer Book,the consciences of the clergy and laity of the Unted Church of England and Ireland, and to the law of the Church, as it has been identified by the Act of Uniformity with the law of the State The address is digned by a con serable number of the High Churh clergy.

CArsotRNUN WINEs.-The United States seem to comprise within themselves every variety of material and production of the globe, and, as our possessions are nearly one-eighth of the world, we are not surprised at the fact. But of all the States of the Union California seems likely to be the most productive; her gold and other nines, her location on the Pacific coast, her hard-working population, and her natural advantages, all tend to make her the most important to the interests of the commonwealth. One of her last and newly-developed capabilities Is that of vine-growing and wine-making. We have received a communication on this subject from Mr. Charles Kohler, a gentleman in the native wine business of that oity, who generouslv ascompanied his letter with samples of the native wine of his own produotion, which for flavour and quality seemed to us to be equal to many European brands, and only wanting in age. California is going to be a wine-growing country, and for the following reasons:"In the first place," says the California farmer, "our vineyards produce ordinarily nearly three times as much as those of Europe and the tramontane States. In France a first-rate crop from an acre is represented by 5,0001b. of grapes, ann in many districts 2,0001b. is oonsidered a fair crop; in Ohio S,OOOlb. is a very large crop, and the ordinary amount is from 4,0001b. to 5,0001b. ; but in California the ordinary crop is from 10,0001b, to 13,0001b, and 15,0001b. per acre is not uncommon. Secondly, our grapes never fall, as they frequently do in Europe and on the banks of the Ohio; nor do they ever produce so little as the largest crops which can be produced there. In other vine-growing countries they areexposedto the attacks of frost, hail, the oidium (or rot in the wood), and insects, either of which often causes an entire failure of the crop - but they are unknown here. The oidium is a disease which firt appeared in France about four years ago, and has caused such devastations that the wine crop since then has fallen off im. mensely, and about one fourth of the vineyards have been rooted out and cultivated in other vegetables. In the third place the vineyards of other countries require four or five tunes as much labour as those of California. Here the vine stands by itself; in almiost every other vine-growing district the vines mubt he tied to a stake for support. Indeed, the European vineyards require constant looking after and labour, while those of alifornia when once Dlarted require verv little care, other than a couple of ploughings in a year to xeep them clear of weeds. Again, our land is cheap; vine settings can be had for nothing. The growers are never troubled by rain; the warmth of the climate aids ferment.tion; and, lastly, from one species of grape and from one vineyard the California wine-grower caa make five or six entirely different kinds of wine, corresponding to most o the important kinds of European wines. Thus the Malaga grape, in the vineyard of Los Angelos, produces wine like the Sauterne, and claret, shemz', port, angd champagne, winle n Europe each district produces only one kind of we, adcould not be made to Preduce so many as come fro th Caifoniagrape. Bgd3es, our winces are good, an psomise to be equal in every respect to the best from Euroe.

THE 2IrUBDER I2X HERTFORDSHIBP STE VE'NAGE. Nov7. IL. This c'aornlng Jeremiah Carpenter, a farm l.boarer in the empluient of Mr. Hiorne, of Norton-green farm, and who has 'oeen apprehended or; suspicion of having murdered J&an Starkins, one of the Hertfordshire County Constahalry, was brought before the Rev. E. Prodgers anad r. Morris Prior, magistratis of Hertfordashire, and formally charged with the offemce. The prisoner, who is a powerful-looking fellow, about 5 feet 9 inches in heighit, and apparentiy About 40 years of age, was respectably dressed in the usual clothes worn by the labourers of the district, but wore no s,aockfrock. He seemed to regand the whole prooeedings with callous in. difference. He was not bandouffed. All the exertions of the polioe to discover the hat of the policeman and also the smock frock in which the prisoner was dressed -on the night of the murder have been hitherto unavailing. Some clothes seized by the police am Carpenter's house, which the prisoner stated were his, were sent to Professor Taylor for examuination, and the evidenos of that gentteinan will be found below. The case presents many points of difficulty which require to be cleared up, and so important is it considered to obtain some additional evidencethba Captain Robersson has brnught almost aU the inspectors to assist in the searc, which has been bitherto unrenritting. hlr. Beaver, a srveyor, of Hitchin, has been emplosed to make a plan of the fields in the neighbourhood of the murTder, hich was produced at the examination. The depositions to-day were taken by Mr. Veasey, the magistrates' clerk. Captain Robertson, assisted by Superintendent Barnes, conducted the case for the prosecution, and Mr. Fitzjohn, solicitor, of Stevena,e, watched the proceedings upon the part of the prisoner. The following is the additional evidence given to-day.- Inspector Havrkes, having been caled, stated that the deoeased, Joln Starkins, was stationed at Stevenage. Witness saw him last alive on Friday, the 30th of October, at 1 o'olock, when ho went on his usual beat. Not returning at 9 o'clock, witness searched the town and made inquiries respecting him, bet without obtaining any information. On the foUlowmg day the search was resumed by wit. ness and a policeman named Wilson, and from information he received he was induced to search the neighbouring fields, in oompany with some ef the neighbours. They had a dog with themn and searched the woods, but without effect that day. They also inquired' at the deceased's lodgings, but they had heard nothing of him. On the Sunday he received information that the deceased had been seen on the railway bridge on the after. noon of the day on which the murder was committed, and on Monday witness summoned all his polUce force to join in the search. They commenced searching early in the mornIng, and about 11 o'clock police-constable Isgate, who was in the next field to witness, called to him to come to the pond. He went immediately to him, when Isgate showed him the dead body of Starkins lying in the pond. By witness's orders the corpse was taken out of the pond, when it was discovered that the throat was cut and the head nearly severed from the body. There were other wounds found on the body. The deceased was dressed in his usual policeman's clothes and had his greatcoat on. About 20 yards from the pond witness observed the marks of a dreadful struggle; the field was partly in grass and partly in turnips. The spot at vwhich the scuffle took place wvas in grass, and it was much beaten down, and the ground was saturated with blood. Some of it was in a coagulated state. There appeared to have been between one and two quarts of blood in that spot. The bloody appearance was so great that it seemed as if a sheep or some other animal had been slaughtered. There was also an appearance as if a heavy body had been dragged along the grass to the edge of the pond; the grass appeared, to have been beaten down in one diLection. He saw no footmarks; The grass was too high to leave any imprints of a mansfeetontheground. He directed the body to be removed to an inn in ,the viUage (the Chequers) and left some officers to watch the spot. He then pursued his investigation of the field, and about 95 yards from where he discovered the blood and in a portion of the field covered with wheat stubble he came upon rnother spot where there were marks of a struggle, and on examininng the ground he found a quantity of wheatstrewn about. The soil was disturbed there a good deal and there were marks of feet on the ground, but not distinct. He saw no traCes of blood there. The wheat appeared to have been spilt. Between the spot where the wheat was spilt and where they found the blood, nearer to the latter, a pair of handouffs were picked up by one of the police constables. There were also marks of persons having passed between the two spots, Mr. PRIOR.-Was there any blood, or traces of blood, upon the hands of the deceased ? The witnesY replied that there were no such marks, Examination resumed.-On Saturday following the murder witness called at the house of the prisoner, and found that he had a wounded leg. He asked him how he had hurt his leg, when he told him that the injury was caused by a piece of wood falling on it. He showed him the place, and it was very black and swollen, but the skin was not broken. In replyto a question he put to him the prisoner said tbat he had been working in one of the fields on Mr. Horne's farm, and that he had come homo by the side of GunweUl's wrood, and in front of the two cottages standing in the field; he also said that be got home about half-past 5. It was 1 o'clock when witness called at the house of the prisoner, and he was surprised to find him home at that hour. On Monday he went zagin to the prisoner, and asked him where his knife was, and he said thathe had given it to his son. When they discovered thata mnurder had taken place they suspected the prisoner immediately. He had-the prlsoner stripped anad examined by a surgeon, and also examined his clothes, and saw what seemed to be traces of bloed on his boots. The Rev. Mr. PRODG1;BS.-HaVe yon any facts upon which you grounded your saspioiong? Witness.-On the 21st of October I told Starkins that I suspeoted the prisoner had been stealing corn from his master's farma, and directed him to keep his eye on him. I also told him which way he went home from his work. By Mr. Veasey.-He took possession of the prisoner's clothes, and subsequently gave them to Superintendent Barnes. By the Rev. Mr. PRODGERS.-The pockets of the deceased were not torn. There was no appearance of a desperate highway robbery upon him. Evidence was then produced for the purpose of tracing the deceased to the last moment at which he was seen alive. Professor Taylor wasthen called, and, having been sworn, made the foUowing statement :-On Thursday, the 5th of November, I received from Superintendent Barnes at the chymical laboratory of Guy's Bospital the undermentioned articles-a knife, a smockfrock, apair of corduroytrowsers, a pair of boots, and a pair of gaiters. On Saturday, the 7th of November, I also received at the same place from Super. intendent Barnes a shirt, a quart bottle containing a colourless liquid, a spade without a haudle, and a wicker basket. These articles have been submitted to a chymical and microscopical examination. L The knffe.-The blade was perfectly clean, and there were no marks of blood either on the blade or on the handle. On removing one half of the buckhom handle from the plate of iron to which it was rivetted there was a deep red stain mixed with rustand dirt. Itwas found to consist of coagulated blood in a dry state. The blood must have penetrated between the buckhorn handle and the iron plate, and have there coagulated, 2. The smockfrock.-This was damp, and felt as if it had been exposed to wet. It presented no appearance calling for particular notice. A portion which was stained was examined, but the stain was not owing to blood.. 3. The corduroy trousers.-These presented many stains, chiefly at the back and on the sides. Five different portions were examined, but they yielded no evidence of the presence of blood. In the groove of a bone button taken from the left knee there was found a firm coagulum of blood. It had a bright red colour and was apparently fresh. In one of the holes of this button through which the thread had passed, there was also a small coagulum of blood. The appearance was such as would be produced by the wiping of blood from the surface of the button. There was a slight smear of blood on the cotton string connected with this knee. 4. The boots.- These were much covered with sand, mud, and clay. Por. tions of leather presenting the appearance of stains resembling blood were removed and examined. There was no satisfactory evidence of blood, but in addition to sand there was found by the aid of the microscope a number of starch granules, havingtheappearance of wheatstarch. 5. Theleather gaiters.-These presented some dark stains, especially on the left side. A chymical and microscopical examination bhowet that these stains were caused by coagulated blood. Granules of wheat starch were also found mixed with blood, The leather near these stains presented in some parts a rough appearance as if it had been scraped or rubbed. An inside loop of the left gaiter presents a smear of blood. This has been left undisturbed. 6. A shirt.-Numerous small spots of blood were found on the back, sides, and front of the shirt. Some of these were inside, while others were outside, and had not entirely penetrated. One stain on the outside in front presented the appearance of a smear. Stains of ironmould were found 3n nsoue parts, and a stain arising fro.m blue vitriol was seen in front. The left wristband was stiffened, and the stiffenin,g was found to be owing to its containing a quantity of soap not -washed out, and not found in the other wrietband or in the body of the shirt. This wristband presented one long yellow mark arisingfrom ironmould, and several greenish-coloured sPots arisng from a solution of blue vitriol. There wvas not the slightest trace ef sugar of lead in this wristband. The quart bottle contained a colourless liquid, which was found on |analysis to be a solution of acetate orsugar oE lead,, with- out any adnixture of blue vitriol, or any preparation of iron or copper. The spade presented marks of iron rust intermixed with chalk, clay, and a few granules of wheat starch. 7. The wicker basket.-On portions of the wickerwork ins1de there were small stains of a bright red colour. The3e were found to be owing to blood, the blood having appa. rently coalated as it came in contact with them. this blooo, lke that found in the groove of the button, had the appearance of fresh blood. The conclusions which I draw from this examination and analysis are,-that there were stains of blood inside the handle of the knife, on the button, and on the corduroy trousers, on the outside of the gaiters, on the shirt, and on the wickerwork of the inside of the basket; that the stains found on the inside of the handle of the knife, on the button of the corduroy trousers, and on the wickerwork of the basket, had the appearance of coagulated blood. This appearance would be assumed by blood issuing from the body of a living person, or of one recently dead, that is, beI fore the blood had naturaUy set or coagulated. That some of the small bloodstains on the shirt have been apparently produced by blood reaching it from the outside. That the bloodstains above-mentioned present the characters of human blood. At the same time there are no certain ,critera by which, in the dry state, human can be distin- iguished from animal blood, No certain opinion can ba given of the date at which the stains were produced on the handle of the knife and gaiters. The stains found on the button and on the wiokerwork of the basket have the appearanee and properties of recent or fresh blood. Soap in large quantities and blue vitriol have been appliedto the left wristband of the shirt-the soap subsequently to the washing of the shirt, and the production of she stains from blue vitriol. The lotion in the bottle would not account for the appearance and condition of the wristband. Several witnesses were then exzimlned, whose evidence w2s takers before the coroner amd reported in T7ze Times of Tuesdva3 last. Aft' r the examinstion of these witnesses the prisoner was remvnsded tll Tuesday neet, and in the mesnLime the police wvnl make a fnrther sesech for the clotbes of the prisoner, tbere being strong reasens for supposing that, a portio3t at least of thexL h%ve been buried, and that those taken by tbe police ou the Mondxy following the murder were e4ther some old dothes beloDging to the prisoner, or some that he bad obtained from another labourer. On this hypothesis the gzrden of the pisoner and one or two others have been dug uzp. It is genera'l believed that the pri-oner went out the rnght after tEe murder for the purpose of concealing the clothes and also to dispose af the body of the murdered Im_ .

Possrn, RESuITs OF Tux AMyRICAN Cm-sis.-The New York Herald says :-" We have repeatedly called attention to the hundreds of thousands of men, in the vigour of youth and prime of manhood, that are now thrown out of employment In our midst, and who are ready for any enterprlse, anyprospect of advancement, that may present irsef to them. Their condition here Is not like the condition of the poverty-stricken classes of Europe. There are no standing armies, no admitted social organization of superior and inferior classes to keep them down and force them to suffer in silence and inaction. Individual enterprise is free, and every man may go where he likes and as he likes, with arms in his hands or withoat them, provided he does not infringe the laws by niaking an armed organization within our territory. To this we have to add the facilty with which every man amaong us abandons one vocation and takes up another, and those military tastes that lead all our youth to play the soldier, and practise the use of arms at his leisure, and merely as a matter of amusement. Ever since we were a nation our people have gone en martialiaiug themselves, till now we are the most military people on the face of the earth, and our volunteer service is the most popular army in the world. While such is the condition of the people, the position of our public and representative men is equasly striking. During the political canvass a year ago hr. Buehanan's op ponents dared not use against him, to any great extent, his participation in the Ostend manifesto, for they well knew that it would operate much more to his bene6t than to his injury among the masses. Now, when a financial revulsion has swept away all the old political issues that once divided parties among us, and new forms of public atgitation are springing into life, a clique of shrewd sectional leaders are seizing upon certain popular cries, In order, if possible, to force the Administration into carrying out the policy of the Ostend Manifesto. Just causes of war can be found at any moment that wiU readily influence the popular miad. The elements of war are effervescing within and around us. Whatever may be the wishes of Mr. Buchanan and his Cabinetnd there is no doubt of their desire to preserve peace, and their determination to prevent illegal expeditions from our shores-there is no telling how soon they may be carried irresistibly into a popular foreign war, and forced to give employment to the hundred thousand men that are at this moment ready to embark in any Filibuster expedition, and thus meet the exigency of souathward expansion and an equilibrization of the Senate. We are now in the midst of revolutionary times, when the minds of men are becoming ready for any and every desperate enterprise; and if we do not get some kind of a war upon our hands to work off the surplus energy and enter. prise that will soon be unemployed among us, we may auti. cipate that it wiU follow the lead of private individuals and develope a Filibustering spirit such as has never before beea seen. Let but one partially successful leader anywhere show an opening and an opportunity, and voluntary emigration will become the order of the day, and such a tide be poured forth from these States as wiUl astonish the world. It will not be composed, like the armies of Europe, of the rabble drawn from the purlieus of crowded cities, fit food for powder only. Mechanics, skilled in every art that the labour of civilized man knows; agricuxlturists, familiar with alU the soils and produots of the earth ; mer chauts bred to trade, and who are capable of organizing the commerce of any new country at once; young politicians, ambitious and competent to become statesmen in a new community; inventors, that with a jack knife and a piece of wire are capable of building a steam-engine; labourers, inured to toil and with a ready adaptability to every kind of work- priests to build churches; lawyers to frame codes; doctors and surgeons to attend the wounded; ofcers trained to the art of war in every class of military school, from West Point to the worst furnished State academy; and hosts of men ready and capable of turning their hands to anything-these are the multitudes that are being now thrown out of work here, and who want only half a chance to overran Mexico, Central America, St. Domino, Cuba, or any other of the countries that are now going rongh the disintegratn'g =fcesa°o preparing for the atdvent of the Filibutr. esal need a war to start the life currents of the bodypolic and to clear the atmosphere. This country is readyfor it; the people are ready for itaU are trained to the use of arms. Priest and layman, mechanic and labourer, professional man and he without a profession, master and apprentice, high and low, rich and poor, al know how to use the ride; and when they have nothing else to do allaerayUuet In this state of thinlo out fr wildwfrit from the present revulsion.
