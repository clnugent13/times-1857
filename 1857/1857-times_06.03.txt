THE AxTICIPA TED REFOr uIrz. The Duke of Cleveland presided at a Couservative dinner in Darlington on Monday, given to Mr. Farrer, the late member for South Durham. About 450 electors were present. In giving the toast of the day-viz., "The Health of Mr. Parrer," His GR&CE took exception to a statement reoently made. by Ir. latt, M.P., to the effect that until the election of' two Llberals this division of the county had been unrepresented, and he contended that this could with greater pro priety be -aidby the 2.000 electors, a grreat part of whom " plumped" for Mr. Farrer. This led hima to speak of tile New Reform Bill, on which subject the noble duke said,Gentlemen, Ineed scarcely tell you that I am waxing fast into years, and cannot boast of that vigour and that power which are the charaoteristies of youth; but thereis one advantage which old ago has, and to which I may lay claimvl.r, experience, my elperience being derived fromu1aving been 45 years a member of the Seuate-S0 in the Lower and 15 in the Upper House. During those 45 years I hava endeavoured to make myself master of the history of my country, and especially of itg Parlianentary history, both ancient and modern. The result of my exnerice audI reading is this-that, loInga conte (whch even. beforethe Reform Bill of 1832werealways large constItuencies) It has almost invariably happnecd that where different opinions have been ntarly baanoed theconsti tuents have acknowledged that one party should have one member and the other the other. If the minority, h ever, should be so small as only one-fifth, then I think the four-fifths have a right to return both members. The numbers, however, were very nearly balanced at the last. election for this county, and whatever Mr. Hutt nsy say to, the contrary as to the last 10 years, I say that 2,000 men are unrepresented at this moment. But one thing is quit& certain, before another election we shall have a nec Reform Bill. It has already been announced by the Prime Minister, and can be no longer a matter of doubt. Brought forward as it will be with the whole weight and responsibility of the Government, there can be no doubt that it wil be well digested and considered beforehand, and I hope it may be such a measure as the whole coun'trv can approve. What I have not seen I can give no opiniron about, but I ahall be prepared, in my place in Parliament, whenever that Bill comes before us, to give it that serious attention which the subject wil deserve, and to assist in making such oorrectiona as the hon. members or the House of Commons now present vill excuse me forPaying are sometimes necessary in BiUs that come from that. House. (" Hear," and laughter.) The subject is an extea dve and wide one,. and it isimpo6sible to say what may be, proposed. What most people are anxious for is an exten. sion of the franchlse. But, to begin with, I hope aU anomalies wil be got rid of, and the small constituencies, of which there are so many, and which I cannot help saying ae. a disgrace to the country (applause), be done away with. and their members given to larger bodies of persons. Now, gentlemen, so far from holding that an extension of the. franchise in counties would be injurious, if extended in theway it ought to be, and among those who ought to have it -those who from their education and station in life ought. according to the spirit of the age to be enfranchised-I hold that the constitution would be materially benefited. What. are the classes to which I allude? Well, there are manyz with large money qualifications and residentia counties, but, who from various causes are not qualified now to be on the register, who ought, in my opinion, to have a vote for the county in which they reside. I will not only say that every man who has 100l. a-year-but I would even go lower, and. say that those who have o01. a-year, no matter from what it comes-are fuly entitled to the franchise in coun'tieL (Cheers.) This would include all curates (hear, hear), almost. every village schoolmaster, clerks in mercantile offices banks, and railways, and others; and it cannot be denied that all these persons are entitled to the franchise, and ought to have it. There is another clams of personn whon it. has been attempted to bring in, but who I hope to God. never wil bo brought in, and that is thie renters of 101 houses. (" Hear," and laughter.) Rely upon my words'if that is once done the landed interest in every county in. England is extinguished for ever. Upon what principle, 1et me ask, is the journeyman mason or carpenter, who resides in one town in one county this year and in another town in another county next year-who has no permanent residence or stake in any county-upon what principle is he to claim a. county vote? The noble duke proceeded to remark that, with oDly one noticeable exception, all the great landed. proprietors of the distriet.supported Mr. Farrer, and then asked,-Is the landed interest to be extinguished or not, or is it to have its due share in the representation ? Gentlemen, this is a question more for you than for me, but what. ever may be your opinions and whatever your actions, yon may always rely upon my support. . (Cheerm.) We, have heard some talk of coalitions between caudid.tes. I think them unjastifiable, but they are within the law and it is noe at present possible to prevent them. I am not without hopes, however, that in the new Reform BiU this may be remedied. Lord John Russell, seeing the hardship of 3,500 out of 6,000 (for er. ample) monopolizing the whole representation by split votes, indicated a way in which this could be obviated. Tha3 only way-and, though it was not his own proposition, he hoped it would be adopted-was to allow electors in cOUnties returning three members to give only two votes. In. Berks, Iferts, and other counties it had before nowhappened that, by coalescing, three agricultural candidates had kept out their opponent,-call him Whig, Radical, or what you wilL Now, a Reform Bil should not have regd to particular interests, but should have for its object justice - to all, and he therefore hoped it would bo enacted that no county voter should be able to vote for more than two outof three members, or for more than one out of two. (Cheers.) This would, he the most effectual bar to coalitions, and the most popular men would then be elected. (Hear, hear.)ve eah Mtr. F.RBERn responded in a very effective speech, Lord L. VA?x TEnyr, MYLP., proposed " The Health of' the Chairman." The Duke of CLEVErA9'D, in responding, glanced at the. present position of parties. He objected to the old designation of Tories, who, in the ordinaryaccptation of the, term, went out with the introduction of the Reform Bill in .1832. There were now other denominations-Conserva. tives, Liberal Conservatives, and Conservative Whigs, and there were also Destractives and Radicals. But what was the difference between Liberal Conservatives and Liberal Whigs he could not understand. If agentleman who at the close of the late election said that Toryism was dead meant. to saythat all political principles except those of the De. structives and Radicals were extinct, he would some of thesadays find himself mistaken. (Hear, hear.) The health of the member for North Durham having been drunk, Lord A. VA2zE TEsrPrST resonded, and also alluded toe. the popular notion of party distinctions. There had long been a misunderstanding on this subject. People were persuaded that the Liberal was the kindliest, most conscientious, goodnatured, and generous man in the world, and the Conservative the most tyrannical, bigoted, and awful monster on the face of the earth. He believed the people would soon open their eyes and get rid of this fallacy. There was another idea-vvi, that Conservatism could not be progressive; that Conservatives were a species of politic milestones,immoveable; and that Liberals were t^he orly gentlemen of progress. He believed the people would soon be relieved from this delusion aleo. Another idea was that Liberal Government was the Government of the peopleand yet the present "Liberal" Government was composed of one duke, one marquis, five earls, four viscount, three lords, and nine baronets. (Cheers.) He wasproud to see the great families of the ountry taking their share in the Government, but in what sense could a luminous peerage of this sort be styled the Government of the people? The time w.s coming when people would no longer believe that thor, could be no liberty or happiness except under Whig oligarchical rule, and when they would see that men of great Conservatve name wero as much actuated by love of country as the few families who had long held a lethargic monopoly of rule, and a real monopoly of patronage and place. Cheers. MIr. MoNvBn&Y, m.P., in responding to a toast, took upthe same subject, and pointed to the great increase of ex. penditure since 1816; the miscellaneous estimates having nearly doubled, the department of law and justice trebled, the stationery doubled, and soon. This was Liberal progress, and people allowed themselves to be deluded into the belief that the Liberal party of 1857 was identical with that which, under Lord Grey, in 1830, inscribed " Peace, Retrencbment, and Reform" on their banners. The last act of theseo so-caled Liberals was an endeavour to relieve themselves at the expense of the county-rates from those charges which gentlemen ambitious of a seat in Parliament had hithertotaken upon themselves-hustings expenses, &o. The hon. gentleman went on to declare his belef that no party would be more anxious to help forward a fair Reform Bill than his own; and he hoped the consequence would be that. whether Darlington got a member and elected Mr. Peae ornot, at any rate Mr. Farrer would he restorod to his old place in the courty. (Cheers.) A variety of other toasts were drank, and the camp nybecame very jolly and noisy.
`IT,E LATE DOUBLE RETURN FOR H1UNTGDONSHEIB.-The petition presented by Mr. Edward Fellowes against the return of Mr. John Moyer Heathcote for Huntingdonshire is a very Bingular docutment-one of the most extraordinary " developments," in fact, of the late general election. It alleges-L- That many persons voted in the election twice for Heatbcote, and thst both such votes were. reckoned in casting up the poll. 2. That persons voted in the wrong booths. 3. That many votes recorded in favour of the petitioner were strack out by the returaing oficer or hisdeputy, and were omitted to be cast up with the petitione9s other votes. 4. That many voters were reckoned on the poll in favour of Mr. Heathcote who did not, in fact,. vote for him, but who were personated and fraudulentlySepresented by other persons; and that many persons who had no right to voto in the election personated other electors or deceased electors. such votes beiDgreckoned infavour of Air. Heathcote. 5. That the votes of many persons who werenot upon (or who oughtnottohave been upn)theregis. ter of electors were reckoned in favour of Mr. Heathcote. 6. That many persons' votes were reckoned in favour of Mr. Heathcote, whereas they voted for the petitioner ; and that others were reckoned as having Toted for Mr. Rust and Mr. Heatheote, whereas, in fact, they voted for Mr. Rust and the petitioner. 7. That persons voted for Mr. HeathCot3 whose names were erroneously retained upon the register by theunintentionalm3istkeoftherevisg rri2tsr. Thab many persons' votes were reckoned in favour of Mr. Heath_ cote whose names were upon the register, but who were dis. qualified by legal incapacity from voting at the election. 9. That maDy persons voted in favour of Mr. Heathcote in respect of property of which they were only mortgagge or trustees. 10. That many person voted in fvour of hr.

MO1QRY-MARBETaid OITYINTELIGBENOL?. ~~~~Taeaday Evening. The quotation of gold at rarts in about 6 per mills premium, and the short exchange on London a 25.27k per IL. aterling. On comparing these rates 'nith thoe Eglish Mint Price of 31. 17s. 10 j pr ounce for standard gol it appea that gol is taearly 2-10ths per cent. dearer ia Paris than in London. By adv3css from Hamburg the price of gold is 423* per mark, and the short exchange on London is I3.4k per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore nearly 1-10th per cent. 4larer in London than in Ramburg. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is loi pe cent., which, when compared with the Mint proportions between 'the two countries, shows that the exchange is about at par; and, after making allowance for charges of transport amd difference of interest, the present rate leases a snall profit on the importation of gold from the United States. Inmediately on the comnaencement of business o-day the Bank broker aanounced that the Bank will make their usrual advances on stock during the approaching shutting at &i per cent., and this, -couplel with the news of the arrival of the Mexican as eamer with 632,5001., causedthe7funds toopen with firmness at an advance of an eighth. A oontinued -pressure for money then caused a relapse to 93i, from -which there was again a temporary re*covery to 94 to J. Ultimately the market had an inanimate appearance, a rather less -favourable condition of the continental exchanges, consequent upon the recent purchases of silver, coupled with the receipt of deaponding accounts from Paris, tending to create general dulness, and there were sellers at 94 for money, while for the ;ccount on the 9th of July the last transactions were -at 94d, or 931 ex. dividend. Bank Stocl,peft off at p212 to 214; Reduced, 92k to'.; New Three per -Cents., 92i to J ; India Stock; 221 to 223; India Bonds, 9s. to 4s. discount; Exchequer Bonds, 98, to I; and Exchequer-bills, June, 2s. dis. to 2a. preinium; March, 3s. to 6B. premium. The advances to be made by the Bank during -the' Bhutting will, as uEsual, be upon Governnent securities of all kinds, as well as upon India Bonds. They will not be granted for a less period than 14 days, and must in every case be repaid on -or before the 11th of July, beyond which date there will, it is believed, be no extensions. The demand for money in the discount-imarket as well as in the Stock-Exchange continues with full force. Foreign securities were steady, and in some cases .there was a slight improvement. Turkish Six per 'Cents. for the account were negotiated at 95* and J. In Venezuela purchases took place at the advanced vprice of 37, but subsequently transactions occurred -at 36. The general business comprised-Brazilian 'our-and-a-Half per Cents., 97 ; Chilian Six per -Cents., 101i; Portuguese Three per Cents., for the account, 46i; Spanish Three per Cents., for ac-eount, 42k; the New Defer 25j; and Dutch &our per Cent. Certificates, 97k. In the foreign exchanges there wa- no alteration of importance from the rates of last post, but the lendency was towards flatness. Uninterrupted heaviness prevails on the Paris Bourse. The final quotations of the French Three -per Cents. this evening were 69f. lOc. for money, and 69f. 35c. for the account, showing a further -decline of nearly a quarter per cent. Of the total of 632,5001. brought by the West India and Mexican steamer to-day, 548,0001. is silver, andt84,5001. gold. This is 112,0001. in excess -of the largetarrival at the beginning of last month. The Wave of Life has arrived from Sydney with 16,0001. in gold, and the Morning Star from Melbourne with 193,0001. The Indus, on the 4th, is now expected to take -out silver to the amount of 850,0001., making with the additional sum likely to be shipped at Marseilles a total of 1,000,0001. The following packet of the 20th is already engaged to take out 600,0001. About 10,0001. of the gold brought from New York yesterday was sold to the Bank to-day. The shipping returns of the Board of Trade for the month ending the 30th of April show a falling off in the number of arrivals, owing to a long continuance of adverse winds. The clearances present an increase commensurate with that in the declared -value of our exportations. Subjoined are the .general figures:- -Entered inward- With regard to the coasting trade, it appears the tonnage entered inward was 1,028,357 in April, 1855; in 1856 it was 1,036,261, and in the present return it is 1,108,156, including 37 foreign vessels, of an aggregate burden of 5,389 tons. The clearauces outward were 1,087,478 in April, 1855 ; 1,100,153 inl1856, andl1,326,244,including2,212 of foreign, The Excise statements for the first quarter of the present year bave also been issued. The following table exhibits the quantities of the several articles -charged with duty in the united kingdom during that period as compared with the corresponding thmee months of 1856. A considerable increase is shownunder each head, except that of home-made sugar, the experiments in connexion with which appear at length to have been abandoned EXCIS4. Attention has recently been called to a case which presents a further illustration of the legal uncertainties that can be thrown in the way of English holders of American railroad securities when there is -a disposition on the part of any company to take advantage of them. In 1848 the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railway resolved to imsue new stock to an amount equal to 10 per cent. of their existing capital. and that the shareholders should be requested to subscribe in that proportion. Mr. J. W. Cowell an English holder of 400 shares, consequently re-ceived an invitation to take 40 new shares. He had no wish, however, to increase his holding, and therefore abstained from applying for them. Subse<iuentlyhe was informed that a Mr. Fisher, of Philadelphia, who had assumed a leading part in the management of the concern, had taken upon himself to make the subscription on Mr. Cowell's behalf, although he was personally an entire stranger to Mr. Cowell, who had never conferred upon him -or an one else a right to act in the matter. Mr. 'Cowel, of course, would not recognize the transaction or pay any of the calls demanded on the new stock. In the three subsequent years, however, the -company paid dividends on the old stock, and, as a total of $1,700 thus became due to Mr. Cowell, they determined to seize it and to apply it to the pay1ment of the calls on the new stock, which he had never consented to take, but which they had resolved to foist upon him. Mr. Cowell thbreupcn brought an action for the recovery of the amount, and obtained a verdict against them. Supported by their corporate funds the company sti prolonged the contest by carrying it before -the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania, where it was argued a fewv months back. The judges then ordered the case to be re-argued before a full bench, and as they do not meet again until next wrinter it has nowr to tand over for another year. The conclusion, -whenever it may be arrived at, will be of great interest to all persons on this sicde connected with American investments; and, meanwhile, even supposing the ultimate verdict to be satisfactory, the delay, expeneo, and annoyance inflcted Should operate as a useful lesson. The company appear to set up two discordant pleas, the firt being tat Mr. Cowell must be held to have Gubseibed, as he did not give Immediate notice to the contrary, and the second that he is ahut out from his claim by the Statate of Limitations. In the one istance the company asert that they have paid bim his dividends byapplying them to the new stock, through his agent, MIr. Fiher; and in the other, tiat no application has ever been made for these diidends, either by himself or any agent, and that the clim has now lapsed . Theltterplea i0 peculiarly damaging, since the present " is believed to be the f rat tine a corporation in Pennsylvania has set up the Statute of Limritations as a bar to an action for dividendb by a atockholder who until just before he brought his action bad never demanded them, and who had received no notice that his right to them was disputed." The entire affair seems at present to stand thus :-Supposing the first plea of the company to be admitted, the rule will be established that any person, even an utter stranger, assuming to act as agent may commit a foreign stockholder to an increased subscription, unless such holder shall formally and immediately notify that he never gave him authority; while, under the second plea, the door will be opened to an entirely new class of frauds. Hitherto the law of Pennsylvania, like that of England, has never recognized that a corporation could confiscate the unclaimed property of any of its partners ; but, if this right is to be allowed after seven years, a temporary concealment of the fact of any amounts being due will be all that is necessary for the purpose. The advices from Mexico to-day furnish the details of the recent landing of Californian Filibusters in Sonora. In other respects the news is not of importance. The following mercantile letter gives a discouraging sketch of the general prospects of the country "Mexico, May 3. "The present abject condition of this country bearsasome anslIgy to the state of exhaustion which generally precedes the final extivction of human life. The fate of Mexico seess, indeed, to be no longer a matter of doubt or uncertainty; the absolute sway of the Americans is evidently fast approaching, and. as they have it, maY be considered as 'the nanifest destiny' of this unhappy repub1ic. Recent ace unts from Sonora bring us the news of a fresh burst of Filibusters, under the command of a Mr. Crabb, who lately n,ade their appearance in that department, having crossed the frontier from Tuesan, wbile some of their com. panions are sasd to have gone by sea in order to join tbem. They were, bowever, met by a small forco of Mexican National Guards, under the command of a Mr. Pesqueira, and were obliged to surrender after a very obstinate resistance, having had 14 men killed and 59 made prisoners by the Mexicans, and among the latter the chief, Crabb, who in said to have been severely wounded. The remainder of the gang had succeeded in making their escape, but both Crabb and the other prisoners were to be tried, and it is supposed that they will all have been shot by this time. " But, vhile such ominous symptoms present themselves upon the frontier line, the very centre of the republic is groaning under the heavy weight of the calamities with wbich it is afflicted. The existence of the present Government has become so precarious that hardly a week goes by without some fresh conspiracy being discovered, or some pro,suiiciamiento being announced from the interior. As usual, the Treasury is completely exhausted, and instead of endeavouring to retrieve its finances by introducing order and economy in the administration of the revenue, the Government seems as callous and indifferent on that topic as all its predecessors, and the only expedient it has recourse to Is the favourite and disgraceful system of dishonesty, wbich bae casat EO much discredit upon the whole Mexican nation. It is, no doubt, convenient not to pay any, or at least very few, of the public officers, and to seize any moneq that comes in the way, however sacred it should be consrdered, and again to anticipate the proceeds of the Customhouses at the expense of a heavy discount; but such proceedings can only be attended by a very temporary relief, wbile they infallibly bring in their rear a greater state of penury, and the shame and disgrace which are inseparable from al disbonourable actions. " Mf. Monter, late Minister for Foreign Affairs, left MIexico yesterday in order to embark on bosrd the Solent Royal Mail steamer, having been appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to Rome; but it remains to be seen whenever he reaches his post whether or not he will be received by the Pope, who must be very much displeased with the Mexican Government in consequence of the measures adopted by the latter with respect to the Church property. Since the departure of the last packet a new decree has beonpublished making great reforms in all matters connected with parish dues, which has given rise to a fresh burst of dissatisfaction aongthe clergy. per dOIIJo exchange on London has again gone down to 45&d per dollar." The annexed is from the Cornaittee of Mexican Bondholders:- " The Committeo of Mexican Bondholders have received advices from aMr. Whitehead dated Mexico the 3d ult. Owing to the straits to which the Government bad been put by the non-ratification of tho treaties with the lUnited States, the decree of the 23d of January last had not yet been put into operation, and recoveries in the ports continued suspended, with tho exception of that of Mazatlan, where the agents had shipped$7,470 Slc. per Early Bird, and since then received 93,915 97e. more for the dividend fund, The agents in San Blas also had shipped $3,148 75c. per EArly Bird. Mr. Whitehead had had interviews with the Presi dent, as well as with the Minister of Finance. to urge the immediate exection of the decree of the 23d of Januar. From both he received the assurance that as far as lay m their power the bondholders should have no cause to complain, but that for the moment they could not possibly help themselves. The revenue being productive, it is hoped thas payments will soon be resumed. A dangerous conspiracy had been discovered, but thecountry generally wastranquiL An invasion by land of Sonora, by a party of Californian Filibusters, had been attempted, but the whole of them had been made prisoners." At a meeting of the Bank of British North America held to-day the dividend declared was at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, tog,ether with a bonurs of ll. 10. per share, and the report and accounts were unanimously adiopted. Some explanations offered with reference to the reserve fund, and the amount appropriated to meet doubtful debts, were received as satisfactory. With regard to tho position of Canada, confidence was expressed that the prospects are favourable, and that, although there has been some depression, a steady recovery will take place. Annexed is an abstract of the report and accounts "The accounts exhibit a diminution in the profit for the last year, as compared with that of the previous year amnounting to 6,132f. The disposable profit, however, after deducting bad debts and making provision for probable loss on doubtful dependencies, amounts to 90,943L,, a sum which enables the directors to declare the usual dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, together with the same amount of bonus as that paid for each of the last two years -namely, 1L lOs. per share, this latterbeingfreeof incometax-which leaves a sum of 943L added to the rest. The directors consider it right to state that the acomunts received from the branches for the first four months of the present year do not exhibit an amount of business equal to that of the corresponding period of last year, and they take this opportunity of reminding the proprietors that the amount tow] paid as bonus must always be dependent on any surplus w 'ch may remain beyond a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum. That considerable monetary pressure does exist in the North American provinces is weU known to those connected by trade with that portion of our colonial empire, end there can be no difficulty in acounting for the occurrence of such a pressure. The faot that the interest of money has for some time ruled at a higher rate in Englad than that which the laws prevaiing in Canada and the adjacent colonies allow to be charged must have had a considerable influence in with. drawing capital thence, as well as preventing its introduction. The continuance of a finncial policy so opposite to that adopted by the mother country has attracted the serious attention of some of the colonial Legislatures, and may probably lead to a beneficial alteration in that important matter. It must also be borne in mind that for the last three or four years large expenditure has taken place in the construction of railroads and other improvements, the internaltrade of British North America has been stimulated in a proportionate degree, and a general enhancement in the cost of all commodities has taken place, and, which is of still greater importance, a vast increase in the value of real estate. Many of these works have advanced towarda conpletion, and there is at present a considerable diminution in the outlay, which, with the cause already alluded to, has tended to produce, as a necessary consequence, the reaction now felt. There can be no doubt, however, that great benefit will result from the opening up of the country and the general im. provement thus accomplished. Under such circumstances the directors look to an early return of pnrresslve and permanent improvement. The sum in the balance-sheet at the debit of outlay on bank premises, which stood in the former account at 42,0001., now stands at 44,56001 The actual sum expended during the year in the purchase of land and the erection of buildings at London (Cana West), Brantford, and Three Rivers was 5,2891., but 2,7894 was written off as deducton from the profits. The branch at Newfoundland will be closed and the business discontinued on the 30th of the present mouth, a new local bank taking the place of the branch. The directors have been led to this step from a conviction that the capital heretofore employed in that island could be more profitably used at their other branches. The directors have pleasure in announcing that they have declared a half-yearly dividend at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, and thtt in addition thereto they bave aronedaa ontote sharebolders a porkion of the undivided profits to the extent of 30,000, being 30g. per share, or 3 per cent. on the capital stock of the bank.

At a meeting of the London Wine Company this afternoon the report detailing progress was adopted, but the consideration of a dividend was postponed until the end of the year. As the operations are increasing, it is proposed to augment the qualification of the directors, and to make a call if the holdir.gs of the sbareholders are not enlarged.

At the Court of Bankraptcy to-day Mr. Commissioner liolroyd, in refusing the certiticate of Thomas Ryder, East India merchant of Old Broad-street, made some observations in reference to time bargains in Consols and other stock, in which he for the first time enunciated the law upon the subject. The subjoined from the United Mexican Mining Association contains advices a fortnight later than thoze published yesterday: EXTRACTS OF A DESPATCH FROM THE Conanssroxzps, DATED GUANAXUATO, APRIL 27. Major Farrell writes:-. " Jesus Maria y Jose is in a very prosperous state of w7orking. All the labores enumerated m my letter of the 28th ult. have continued their yield, which may be considered as averaging 700 cargasweeklyof picked, or clean ore. The extraction during the last week has amounted to 800 cargaS, of which 500 cargas may average in ley 10 mares per monton, and the remaining 300 cargas upwards of 6 marcs per monton. "- On Wednesday Inst 500 cargas were sold for $2,742, thus showing the character and value of tho ore to be undixninished with reference to the last sale of greater quantity. "The mine of la Trinidad remains as last reported. Aldana, no alteration. *Hacienda of Do!ores.-Is fully employed in the beneficio of J. Maria ores. The raspa, or scraping of the arrastres, mentioned in my last, was of a very encouragng nature. The yield of gold showed a ley of 1,775 grainu per marc,. another evidence that the vein we are working is that of LA Luz. The value of the raspa (155 marcs) was $9,296, which being what is tesmed 'plata mixta,' was thus divided-gold, $8,490; and silver, $874; cost of separation, $68. " Hacienda of Duran.-We resume possession of this hacienda on the 1st of ALay, and I have already commenced to send ore there, and this will account for the diminution in quantity sold. Th provision of quickdlver and other requirements for the reduction and amalgamation of the ore would at once be proceeded with.

LEATHER ANI) HIDES.-Bemng Whit-Tuesday, no market was held at Leadenhall to-day. A moderate business has, however, been done in the factors' private warehouses at last week's prices. During the past month the transactions in the leather trade have considerably increased in consequence of a disposition to accept rather low er rates for some descriptions of goods. The weekly sales have also exceeded the supplies, and accounts generally concur in representing that very small stocks are held by consumers throughout the kingdom. Under these circumstances it is confidently anticipated that greater activity will shortly prevail.
STATE OF TRADE. MANCHESTERv JTu-x- 2. There is a better feellg in the market both for yarns nd cloths, and a trifling advance has been asked, which, though not obtained, shows an improvement on last week. Bayers are wMiling to give the prices of last week for all kinds of cloth. The improvement is partly attribttable to the ad. vices from India, but more immediately through the progress which has been made in the short-time movement, and the consequent decreasein production. Stockport has now olned theshort-time movement for a month, and besides the looms that partially stopped in the district, it is esti. mated that at least 5,000 looms have been whoUy stopped, either through the poverty of the owners and adverse trade, or through failures In yarns there hasbeen a good demand for 40's mule for India, which is firmer in price. For Germany and tho Mediterranean there is but little demand, and the stoppage of looms has occasioned a quieter market for LOme trade yarns. Messrs.

RAjILW7A I zATfLLIe'oZE. FRENCH RAILWAY TRARFmTt From a comparative statement of the traffic on tb0 pri ciual French railways for 1855 and 1856, compiled by I.

CORK, B3LACKROCIK, AN7D PASSAGE, The half-yearly eraoting of this company was held onL Friday, at Cork, M Er. Hardy in the chair. The Secretary read the report, an abstract of which th appeared in The Timcs. Thrs,e Citssamate in moving its adoption, said it was gre. tifying to the dientors that the had an increase in the traffic, hut he expected that the increase would have bee inuchgreater. Heanticip that they would ha °had an tncreaseaof 500., or 201. -.week, the increase up to the 1st of January having been 301. a-week, but from that date to the Ist of May the receipts showed only a small inoremae over the correonding period of last year. This faluing off it the expected inrease the trafflc arose to some extent froun the decrease in the number of vessels caring at Quenastown, the number heving been only 380 from the 1 t of January to the ist of mtay, against 600 at the corresponding period of 1856. He also found that at Passage the number of corn vessels had been reduceda one-half as comapared with the corresponding four months of 18. Consideting the number of transports arriving constantly in 18 ana 1856 for the purpos of embarldng troops for Mdalta and the seat of war, tiu usthave inceased the traffio in those years, it was a matter of congratulation to them aUl that there shouldl have been an increase in the past half-year. Although the rece its showed an increase of 3001 over the corresponding hiyear of 1856, they.amounted to 1,000er overthe same half-yearof 1855. The increae in the expendi. tur amounted to 164., which was cAused by the purchase of extra rails aud.leepers, the greater portion of which were still unused, and if they had takemi credit for them it would have apparently lessned their expenditure; but they thought it better that al the mon e dd should be charged in the account. (Hear, her )The balance to the credit of revenue amounted to 2,61.1., out of whidi the directors recommended a dividend of 8s. per share, free of income-tax, being at the rato of 4 percent. per annum. If the p resent summer was as good as the last for traffic, they wouldbe able to pay another dividend of 4 pr cent., and carry forward a balance of 1,2001. or 1,4001. The receipt. for the month of May were 2001. in excess of those for the month of May last year, and there-was every re n to expet that the traffic would go on increasing. W."

LONDONZ WElDNESDAY, JUNE 3, 1857. Certainly, the Straits of Dover divide two very different peoples. If the one are very right, the other must be very wrong; and if either Empire is celestial, the other is outer barbarian. Conceive Queen VicToprA, immediately after a dissolution of Parliament, tranasmitting through Sir GEOiXGE GXty a Circular to all the High Sherifs, Mayors, and other returning officers, with a list of candidates, charging them to use every exertion to procure their return, on the ground that nearly all of them had given her the utmost Eatisfaction in the late Parliament, and, with a few new and carefully picked men, might be trusted to do the samne in the next. Conosive her dwelling on the support they had given to her dynaity,: on their sense of the glory and the mnisfortunes connected with her name, and on their loyal belief in the name of GuELPH, or whatever name was taken for the purpose, as the watchword and safeguard of France. Conceive all this done in the most delightful confidence that the appeal would be responded to,-only just a little apprehension betrayed that the people would take it too quietly, too much as a matter of course, and let the QunxN's candidates be elected by excessive and indolent unanimity. But go to Dover, look across the Channel, and there you may see the very cornfields and dwellinghouses of the people who like this style of things, who are governed in this way, who are proud of it, who indignantly spurn any other, and who are most acutely sensible of our own political absurdities. Is it possible to imagine ourselves coming to such a pass? What if CHARLzs I. had carried the day, with the assitance of His HoLINEsS, HIis MUost Christian MAJETY, and his faithful Irish subjects? The name of STUAB&¶ would then have been the palladium of British order and British glory. HMR MAMTY would have found in the member for Buckinghamshire a zealous, enlightened, and eloquent champion of her dynasty, her prerogative, her estates, and her policy; and she 'would accordingly recommend him to the particular attention of the electors of Bucks. She would tell them that she would take it very ill of them if they passed him by for some other less tried person; atil more, if they used the opportunity for factious disturbance by returning somebody who was positively disagreeable to HER MAMETY. It is remarkable that CHARnS I. did this, not through Secretaries of the Treasury or any other quiet agency, but openly; and even then it was thought highly unconstitutional. NAPOLEON IIL does it. He says, with courageous logic, "Others recoin" mend candidates, why should not I ? These are "good men and true, why should not I recommend "them ? They have done their duty, and deserve "to be kept on. You need not return them "unless you like; but, take my word for it, you "cannot do better." It would be very little to the purpose to maintain that our way is better, for the plain fact is that we have our way and the French have theirs; and we might as well propose that cat and dog should interchange their respective habits or adopt a common model, as that either of us should follow the example of the other. It is almost useless to discuss such a style of politics on this side the Channel. No Frenchman would pay the sightest attention to what we had to say on the subject, and to our English readers argument is superfluous. Any attempt of the sort would bring on a revolution. Every candidate branded with the Royal approbation would be obliged to retire, not only from the field, but from public life,-from the sight of man. The most indifferent or most mercenary would redden with indignation if the candidate asked for his vote on so damning a plea. We have our own way, and it is the only right one in our own eyes. Instead of a name or a dynasty we take a policy, not always the distinctest and clearest, but embodied in men or in measures, generally in both. The measures refer to certain changes desired, or otherwise, in our Parliamentary and other national institutions. No doubt, as a fact, the critical questions on which elections have turned for a whole generation have related to rather important changes, constituting, in the whole, a great social revolution. On abstract grounds it might be colourably maintained that this continual and rather feverish agitatiou of serious changes affecting the relations of Church and State, the composition of the Legislature, the Courts of Law, the Colonies, and other important matters, was not much better, or, indeed, very different, from the standing question of this or that dynasty in France; and that the sort of dictation which the mass of the electors submit to from the chiefs of party and opinion is substantially much the same thing as the Imperial rescript in favour of a list of 260 candidates, all proved friends of the reigning dynasty. But this is not an abstract question. The British people and their Sovereigns have long come to an understanding with one another, and there can be no mistake. So, as the old saying has it, we no longer remember that the Sovereign is responsible to the people, and the Sovereign never forgets it. We all feel a moral certainty that VICTORIA'S posterity will sit on her throne centuries hence. But we are a nation of politicians, and we are loyal on the condition that we may have a voice in the continual reconstruction of our political system, and in the choice of the men to carry out our views. No doubt Louis NAPOLEON would be only too ready to let his 9,000,000 electors discuss politics and return members of their own choice, if he could secure that they would not, on some reason or none, vote him a nuisance, and send him out of the country. But this is the very question which the French vish to keep always open. Their question is not measures or men, but the man and the family. It must be admitted that the exaggeration is common to both countries. France thrives with a despotism, and we thrive with a very " anomalous"' Legislature. Purists and theorists want a thousand reforms not only in the Commons, but in the Lords, and far more in the latter than in the former ; yet we have attained to great material prosperity and social happiness. It is a question whether we shall get on better with a House of Commons reformed into the most plausible and symmetrical representation of the people -quite as much a question as whether our neighbours would get on better with any other form of government. Indeed, if anybody comes to consider, it is amazing how very little visible share most of us have in this representative system of which we are all so proud, and which we want to elaborate to the highest perfection. Either you never voted at all, or you are in a minority, or your member never votes, or he is always in a minority, or never speaks or votes, or speaks apparently at random. Yet we jog on and move, too, pretty quicldy ; for a strong public opinion, a power of no form or constitution, the admirer of no name, the supporter of no dynasty, urges on the nation and the Lo<ie- lature, and has urged them on now for many years, intolerant of abuses, indignant of wrongs, and exigent of reforms. With such a power at work, showing itself stronger and stronger every day, it is not so easy to see why some politicians confine their attention to this or that scheme of Parliamentary Reform. Throwing aside every other question for this seems of a piece with the great French question of this or that dynasty. Who can tell how the mneasure or the man will work when he or it comes ? Meanwhile, there are numberless other questions less vast, less comprehensive, less fundamental, but, from their respective subjects and in their proportion, also very important. Do they not lose by our political stargazing? We need not risk all on the question of Radical Parliamentary Reform, any more than our neighbours on the question of this or that dynasty.
I Within the Int few days events have occurred in the Belgian capital which, if met witl less prudence, might have ended in tumult, if not in , revolution, They seem to have attracted less notice abr9ad than they. deserve ;for the battle 'Was the immemorial_ one between bigotry and religious freedom, between the claims of a priesthood and the rights of the State and people. A little wountry must expect that its internal affais will not continually receive the attention of the world; but now and then, when great principles are at stake, Belgium may well ask the sympathy of such a nation as ours, which has encountered the same dangers, fought the same battles, and established the same institutions. The Roman Catholic Church and its pretensions have been the cause of the present conflict. It is well known that the power of the priesthood has been for many years greater in Belgium than in any northern Catholic country. The Belgians, a busy and in some respects a domestic people, have always acquiesced contentedly in the discipline of the Church, partly from habit and an uninquiring temper, partly from natural religious feeling, but chiefly because the Church has been to some extent the badge of their nationality against Protestant Holland on the one side, and freethinking France on the other. The priests consequently have for years had things all their own way. Malines and Louvain have been in the most liberal times strongholds of orthodoxy. The old towns of Flanders, usually so quiet and melancholy, are on every feast day alive with priests and monks, nuns and sisters of charity. Belgian children and schoolboys have been allowed to read nothing but what was doctored to suit the palate of the devotee. A translation of Robinso CGrusoe could hardly be published without a preface warniDg the infant readers that RoarxsoN was unhappily not a Catholic, and even older students were expected to take their history and philosophy and politics diluted with commentaries by some holy father. But now the Church has gone too far. The Belgian people are not quite as docile as their spiritual eulogists in Ireland and England have represented them. In answer to the great and abiding argument against Poperynamely, that the thoroughly Papal countries are sinking in population, enterprise, and civilization, while Protestant communities are doing everything that is done in the world-our Roman Catholics always pointed to Belgium, their one instance of freedom and prosperity in conjunction with their creed. They told us, what to a certain extent is true, that the Belgians, while they yield in industry to no people in Europe, and in enterprise to few, are yet not only sincere, but even enthusiastic votaries of the Church. The events of the last few days show how far they were right and how far mistaken. That the Belgians are good Catholics, and are likely to be nothing else, we freely admit; against the doctrine of the Roman Church no class in the country is likely to protest; but against that aggressive and restless discipline, that interference with families, with education, i with the disposition of property, with the intentions of the sick and the dying, the Belgians, like a -free and sensible people, have at length revolted. We expect no reformation or theological secessiou; the nation will remain as firmly as ever attached to its old creed, but it is not unlikely that from the present time will date a period of reaction against Ecclesiastical usurpation, and that the CRowR and. the nation will be henceforth watchful to preserve the administration of every department strictly under the control of the State. It is the old story of priestly influence using liberal institutions for the advancement of its own designs. Belgium in this respect, as in many others, is but the reflection of France. We all know what in the last eight years have been the achievements of the Ultramontane party. The influence of Rome has been added to the arms of monarchy in combating free institutions in all the countries where liberty had run into excess during the commotions of 1848. In Belgium there had been no democratic outbreak, and consequently the reaction has been less decided. But Brussels is too much a little Paris, and the provinces of King LEOPoroD are too much like French departments, for the influence not to have been deeply felt. Ever since I 1848 the efforts of the Ecclesiastical party have been unceasing, and their success has not been small. TFhe rural population of Belgium, both the solid, sensible Fleming, and the more imaginative and excitable Walloon, have been brought under the influence of the only class which speaks to them with earnestness and authority, and furthermore speaks to them constantly. The Chamber has, year by year, contained a larger number of Ultramontane members; journals have been established to advocate the claims of the hierarchy; a Ministry has been formed strongly prepossessed in favour of Ecclesiastical views, and of late the supporters of the free institutions and the secular policy which are the strength of Belgium have found themselves hard pressed by a faction the opinions of which are better suited to the latitude of Rome or Madrid. It is only a few months since the University teaching which was not under the authority of the Church was denounced, under the pretence that it was impious, and inculcated doctrines hostile to morality and the State. From these charges the professors, who were openly or by implication attacked, convincingly defended themselves. However, a majority in tne Chambers was gained, and this year it was determined to attack the laws which placed the administration of charity under State control. Now, the plea for freedom of charity i specious enough. Why should not a man leave money or lands to the ministers of his own Church for such uses as he may direct or they may determine? But the common sense of every independent people, even in the darkest ages, has decided against allowing the irresolute, the foolish, the superstitious, the sick, and the dying to make over their worldly wealth intothehandsof Ecclesiastical advisers. Sucha protection for thewidow and orphan has been judged necessary by the jurisprudence of our own nation, and we cannot but sympathize with the feelings which established a similar obstacle to spiritual ambition in the Belgian kingdom. But, urged on by priests and peasantry, the majority of the Chamber demanded and voted a Bill allowing full liberty of donation and of bequest This was too much for the inhabitants of the towns. Brussels and Antwerp have long since seen that the course the clergy are pursuing can end only in the destruction of Belgian independence. The constitutional and national party began to svuspect a class of men who are striving to bring the social and domestic life of the country into anaiogy with that of despotic States where the anathema of the priest has always aided the bayonets of the Sovereign. The progress of the Bi was watched from the galeries with interest which increased hourly. The people expressed their feelings in the manner to which we once becanie accustomed by reading the proceedings of the French Assembly. When it was certain that all the efforts of the Opposition would be unavailing riots broke out in Brussels, bands of men paraded the streets, the priests were insulted, and the convent windows broken. The excitement spread to Antwerp, Mons, Liege, Ghent, and other places. The K u-G felt that it was necessary to act resolutely, and his usual sagacity did not forsake him. On the 30th of May he adjourned the Chambers indefinitely. Thus the BiU is lost without any specific rejection on his part. The Ultramontane party is defeated in its most cherished scheme,-that of becoming rieh and, consequently, independent of the State. But the immediate effect is of less consequence than the impression which will be permanently made on the Belgian people. If tbese evenits rouse them to the conviction that they, a small and threatened community of free men, mnst be ever on their guard against principles which are only th6 precursors of despotic authority, the lesson taught by the Ultramontane attempt of 1857 will not have been in vain.
We are so familiar -with the atrocities of the Mormonites that new ones cannot surprise us. We hear these shocking accounts now aLnost with coolness, because it is not in human nature that first impressions of horror can be sustained at their original height long. The most dreadful exposures grow at last by repetition into an order of nature. But, though the excitement of the imagination subsides, reason demands with increasing force and sterniess some practical solution of this infernal mystery-some practical solution in this sense, -that there must be some meeting and dealing with it. How long is this abomination to last? How long? we say, because it must be simply a rmatter of time. There must be a stop put to it, of course. There can be no question about that. Here is a whole territory professing to be part and parcel of the great North American Republic, yet claiming the use of a moral and civil code of its own totally different from that of the great community to which it belongs-a code which is simply a reversal of the religion and the civilization of eighteen centuries, and a recurTence to the savage state in politics and to Paganism in morals. Now, had Mormonism confined itself to the latter of these two relapses, there might have been some difficulty in dealing with it, because you cannot interfere by force with people's morals. The United States would declare, as it did through the Federal Court of Utah, that monogamy was part and parcel of the law of the United States, and therefore that, if a man had married sixteen -wives, fifteen of them were his mistresses, and their children illegitimate. But, having pronounced that judgment, the law could not prevent the other fifteen women from living with a man who called himself their husband, if they chose. The law, then, could not control the morals of the territory of Utah. But, fortunately, the Mormon movement has now ceased to be only apostacy from Christianity and morals, and become rebellion against the State. The last news frona Utah is, that the Federal or United States' Court in the territory had been suppressed by an organized Mormonite force:-" While the "Court was in progress on the 12th ult. the "Mormon members of the bar and others of the "Danite band inveigled Judge STYLES into a "private room, locked the door, barred the win"dows, and then, with revolvers at his head and "knives within an inch of his throat, forced him "to promise to uphold them in whatever they "did, and to sustain the laws of Utah." The Judge submitted, and declared in court the next day that "he should be governed by the " laws of the territory in preference to all others." And on Mr. Bun, the United States' SurveyorGeneral, getting up and formally putting the question whether this meant that the law of the United States was to be superseded, " the whole "audience sprang to their feet, and the Danite murderers, who flled the court, threw off their " coats, brandished their knives and revolvers, " and created so great a confusion that the Judge "w was obliged to dissolve the court." The United States' Court, then, having been suppressed by force, and a formal act of rebellion against the Federal Government having been committed, it would appear that there was only one course for the Federal Government to take, and that that was to despatch a military force to Utah, suppress the present territorial Government, and carry on the laws by means of magistrates of Federal appointment, acting under the protection of the military, until such time as another territorial settlement could be effected. If the United States' Government is true to itself it can have no choice in the matter, because the very principle of the federation is defied by this 3Mormonite act. The Federal law has been virtually superseded in Utah a long time, and the Mormonite juries have refused to convict upon the plainest evidence. But this is an open and a definite act, and, though not done by its real instigator, BmGirAi r YouxG, in person, is not cancelled or punished by him; so that the state of things is this,-that theFederal law is suppressed, and that, in the absence of any effort on the part of the territorial Government to re-establish it, the Federal Government must itself step in and defend its own authority. The 'United States' Government were, perhaps, wise in giving the MIormons rope, and waiting till an act about which there could be no mistake was committed; but now, at any rate, the opportunity is given. We may hope, then, now for something like a break-up of the Mormonite establishment. At present the sect professes to live under a kind of theocracy, which identifies Church and State, and places the priesthood and civil government in the same hands. There must be a considerable drooping of the lMormonite mind when these two authorities are fairly severed, and the Church finds itself one fine morning only-if we may so abuse the word-a religious communion, under a temporal government administered by " Gentiles." How deeply the union of the two estates enters into the Mormonite " idea" we see from these very facts, which are simply the result of impatience of any temporal power independent of and not included within the Church. W"hen, then, the union has been formally severed by the reduction of Mr. BnIGnAMI YoUNG from the King to the Priest simply, a great blow will have been struck at the system, and we hope that such a crisis will open the eyes of many a convert. It is, indeed, lamentable to think how many of our own countrymen have been fascinated by this monstrous delusion. According to the calculation of Mr. CAPvALHo, who was the companion of Colonel FirsxowT in his journey over the Rocky MIountains in 1853, and spent several weeks among the Mormonites, " nine-tenths of the " population were the peasantry of Scotland, " England, and Wales." We cannot account for such a strange infatuation, except on the supposition of a remarkable union of motives and stimulants from different quarters which have conspired to favour it. There has been the emigration movement. The Mormons took advantage of this new tide in the popular mind. It took a great deal to shake the passive and stationary temper of the rural population, to rouse it from its lethargy,. and give it the emigrant impulse. When that impulse, then, was once given them, it implied a kind of excitement of the popular mind, and the unmooring from an old anchorage. The Mormons adroitly availed themselves of this excitement, and turned it to their purpose. Their arguments and pictures were addressed to a mass that was already on the move both in mind and body. Then they appealed to the superstitious element in the popular mind. We know from recent facts how strong that is, and to what an extent the lowest and coarsest imposture takes with our poor,-nay, even with a class above the poorest. That morbid deference to pretences to supernatural knowledge which sends our poor to the " wise woman," and which sUStained such gentlemen as Mfr. HAnnisOir, hsd only to take another turn to follow the Transatlantic "prophet ;" and, with a m orbid religion, discontent and cupidity easily mir gle. The tiine of distress which just preceded the great emigat movement was exactly the time at which the higltly coloured picture of peace, comfort, and prosperity inna new land, drawn bythe Mlormonite misg1cary, would tell most powerfully upon our own people, crushed by low wages and tempted to look upon their own country as a scene of immoveable hardship, inequality, and oppression. It is buit justice, too, to our poorer clases to state that the worst features of Mormonism were studiously kept out of their sight. The mnissionaries from Utah received strict orders to conceal the wholo fact of polygamy; they were even furnished with a false book called Dochtines and Corenants, pretending to give, among other things, the marriage ceremonial in their communion, which only acknowledged one wife. A union of causes thus favoured the Mormonite movement. At no time, probably, in our history were circumstances so much on its side. Travellers who have visited Utah, and even long residents there, assure us that the greater part of the Mormonite emigrants went over without any knowledge of the system, and simply under the influence of a vague belief in some new prophet that had risen up. It was a half-religious, half-worldly dream, which led them out in quest of a sort of earthly paradise, where, under a theocratic rule, peace, plenty, and comfort reigned without interruption or decay. Even so long ago as 1851, however, the progress of Mormonite conversion in this country had reached its climax, and we trust now we shall soon look upon it as an event of the past.
There is such a thing as granting a prayer and yet making the concession utterly futile and useless to the party beneficially interested. Time was when in the columns of this journal we fought a long, and, in appearance, a very successful battle, upon the subject of Smithfield-market. Finally, after a struggle which was extended over a quarter of a century, the day was won. It was a triumphant moment when at last the Tondoners were able to say that henceforward no cattle-market was to be held in the centre of their vast town. There was to be an end for ever to the driving of bullocks through their most populous streets in those hours when the thoroughfares were most crowded. Smithfield was suppressed by Act of Parliament, and a new establishment was opened on the outskirts of the town-in a convenient situation-at Copenhagen-fields. We have now had some experience of the change, and we have patiently waited that the last drops of the good old nuisance might dribble away; but we are compelled at length to say that in many important respects the metropolis has not received that benefit from the change which we had a right to expect. Herds of oxen and flocks of sheep are stil driven all day long through our most crowded streets. Were it not that we know the fact to be otherwise, we might fancy that Smithfield in all its glory was still in full operation. We have not been hasty to complain on this subject, for we are fully aware that time is an important element in the completion of any great change. Month after month, however, has slipped by, and the nuisance still continues unabated. This is obviously the result of defective police regulation. Against the New Cattle-market at Islington and its appendages there is not a word to be said. Almost all the good effects which had been predicted from the change have been realized; but stdll the oxen and sheep are driven about our streets exactly as if the Corporation. and not the public, had carried their point. We beg to call the attention of the Commissioners of Police to the subject. Nothing would bo easier than to enforce a regulation to the effect that cattle should be driven through the metropolitan streets only between certain hours, when the traffic of one day had subsided and the traffic of another day had not begun. It is not for us to fix the exact limits of time which would be most for the convenience of the cattle and sheepdealers, and least to the inconvenience of the public. As representing one party, however, we would say that between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. no serious annoyance to the capital would result from the presence of herds and flocks in the public streets. Cannot some such regulation be enforced without detriment to the interests of the dealers and salesmen? As the matter stands at present, save in so far as our feelings of humanity are no longer outraged by the knowledge of the torture inflicted upon the wretched animals, the public thoroughfares have really gained very little by the transfer of the cattle-market from Smithfield to Copenhagen-fields.
HER MAJExSTYS THEATEB. The opera of Nino was last night revived for the first anpearance of Signor Corsl, a bass singer who, by his vocal and histrionic qualities, has acquired a solid reputation both in Italy and in Paris. His Italian fame is of 12 years' standing, and in the history of the modern lyrical drama he holds a place as the " creator" (or first performer) of Rigoletto in Verdi's opera of that name. So highly gratified was the composer with his success in this character at Milan that he procured his engagement at tho Italian Opera at Paris, where ho sufficiently maintained his reputation to induco the manager, M. Calzado, to secare his services for the winter season of 1857-8. On his first entrance, clad as the Assyrian King, Signor Corsi does not make a remarkably favourable impression, his short, stout figure, rendered stouter by the Oriental costume, scarcely according with the idea of a tragic hero. But the correctness of his vocalization and the skldl with which he manages a not very powerful voice soon gain for him the respect of his audience, who teel that they are listening to a well-trained and conscientions singer. The strong points of the character are not, indeed, rendered with aU the force of which they are susceptible, but the performance throughout is intelligent, and if the artist never excites feelings of awe he at any rate appeals to the sympathies by his unaffected pathos. Altogether Signor Corsi is a thoroughly satisfactory porformer, and may be fairly deemed an acquisition to the theatre. By her delneation of the virago, Abigail, MademoseoUe Spezia made a decided advance in public estimation. The bold, daring character of the upstart slave, who snatches the Assyrian diadem from the ground, when it bas been smitten by lightning from the head of her Royal master, seemed to call forth her energies to an extraordinary degree, Her gestures and deportment were those of one who felt that ebe commanded tho stage, and the imperious nature of Abigail was expressed in the predominance of the voice. When Mademoiselle Spezia first appeared before the public she was checked by nervousneEs to such a degree that her merits were not immediately admitted. But sinco the evening of her d6but she has been steadily advancing, the restraint to which she was originally subjected has been oom. pletely cast aside, and her position as an artist of genius, In. telDgence, and fire, isnowu niversaUly admitted. Her air at the commencement of the second act was applauded with realenthusiasmD and her duet With Signor Corsi in the third wvas followed by an nnanimous call for thema both. Mr- Charles Braham, vwho appeared as Idaspe, aada some. what arduous task before him. His performance of Gennaro in Lucrezia Borgia last year had been far from successful and some of the audience seemed disposed to criticize on the basis of their reminiscences Under these trying Circumstances he acquitted himEelf exceedingly welL HIis voice is natnrally good, and he sng his part in anunost*ntatious, musician-like manner, that soon palled all attempts at opposition, and earned for him a fair share in the general approbation of the evening. The priest Orotaspe is a character of snore importance thar has hitherto been given to Signor Vialetti, but he rose with the increase of his responsibility, and both by his singing and his appearance fully supported the sacerdotal dignity.

THfB TREATY WTZE P , BAGDAD, :ii:X 4. The Govermment of hir May the hah-in* & Of iran has apparently shown no disianlinaion to c4ifbrnAb treaty of peace entered into at Paris on the 41 l oa this year between lord Cowley, on the part Of, ngahld, and Ferukh Khan on that of Persia; foralth*,zh byte articles of tho treaty tbiwe months were alloweabefoitet 'A5 necessary that the respective copies, after tlaving be1i ratified at London and Teheran, should be 'ichanged at I zgdad, yet so great has been the sped at *lhich the Peit an~ emesngers have travelled that the ferth'k ratificatiotl of the peace has taker, plae one month Ed two dayI before the stipulated tine. It is rather r9matable, as X showing the great desire of the Persians for peace, that the hearer of the Teheran copy of the 'ifety actually arrived here before the English oopy of the treaty had been received. It is to be hoped the Persians will show the same alacrity in withdrawizngtheir troopafrom Herat. Hassan Ali-Khan, the chief of the Gibonr tribe,- Is on his way hereto tendet the requisite explanations to-r. Murray, and to invite him in the nane of the Sha of Persia to return to Teheran. It is likely that the British Emby wll leave Bagdad in 15 days from this time. As tbe markiets have been drained to supply the 'wants of the army at Boahiro there will be some difficulty in procuring the nooesary number of mules and other beasts of burden, and the cortege of the Ambassador will be numerous (piobably 500), including the Persiasns who took refuge tinder his protection. The Mission has now been 'resident at Bagdad for more thin 12 months, and never at any time have there beeh so many English together within the walls of the ancient city of tho Caliphs as at the present. Including some offiocers of General Outram's staff; there may be nearly 20 English here in all, yet the natives of the city are by no means as yet accustomed to the novelty of their appeaace, and they are followed by crowds wherever they go. Major Barr, of tho Bombay army, has been for some days employed in taking photographic views. of the mooques and minarets and ancient buildings of the city. Mr. Stephens, Her Britannic Majesty's Consulat Tehoe ran, leaves to day for London with the ratified copy of the X Anglo.Persasn treaty. The-Persians here seem to be rather amused than gratified at the favour shown to their countryman Ferukh Khan at Paris and London, and all say that the' trety would have been received with greater respect had it been referred for confirmation to Sir James Ontram, who came out from England not only to assumo tho commani of the army, but empowered to treat for peace. It vill be impossible to remove the army from Bushire until the month of September, on account of the south. western monsoon, which sets in about the middle of June. There might be time to withdraw a portion of the Buro. pean troops before then, but wo must remain until the conaitions of the treaty have been fulfiled; though, in truth, the Persians do not seem disposed to avoid them. An officer of high rank is to meet the English mission at the frontier, and each tribe is to furish an escort through its territories. It is expected the march will occupy sih aeeks. Tho Pasha of Bagdad some days since made use of his power to declare that in future the Turkish pound should only be valued at 19s. This edict rather disconcerted those who had much gold in hand, but in Turkey one gets Esed to such acts of despotism. His Excellency is by no means a bad governor on the whole. He was educated at Parns, and lately he expressed himself most anxious to join ;be English army at Mohammerah, were it not for tbe opinion 'he Persians would fcrm of such an act. He takes a grepa interest in military affair

TIPPERARY BANX U1MAITAV- DTTRT,TN- 'P?A? -W- A petition from the unfortunate creditors of the TIpperary Bank is to be forwarded this evening for presentation in the House of Commons on the frst night after the Whitsuntide recess. The petitioners pray that the House will be pleased to reject so tnuch of the Bill now before Parliament for winding-up joint-stock companies unable to meet their engagements as gives it a retrospective operation in Ireland, and, after setting out all the legal proceedings that have been taken since the stoppage of the bank in February, 1856, up to the dismisal of ',he creditors' petition bythe Irish Chancellor (an appeal egainst which order is now pending in the House of Lords), they say:- " That the rights of your petitioners and the other creditors of the said bank, on whose behalf the said suit and appeal have been prosecuted at great expense to your petitioners, would, without your petition assent, and against their consent, be most materialy prejudiced and affected by the retrospective operation of the said BiU if passed into law; for if a general compromise or composition should be agreed to against the consent of your petitioners and a la minority of the creditors before the hearing of such appeai your petitioners' rights as such appellants would be altogether destroyed. And, although no such comnromise bhould be effected before the decision, and although upon the hearing of sach appeal the said decretal order should be reversed or varied, and the appelants be declared entitled to have the trasts created by the said Bankers' Act carried into execution ard to relief against those persons who, although not contributories under the Winding-np Acts, ae sought to be charged in that suit as shareholders who did not legaUy transfer their shares to the company so as to be discharged from the demands of the appelants, yet bysuch a compromise or composition the rights of the appel. lants in suchsit would be effectuaUy taken away, and .hose persons who by such a decree should be'held liable to the apellants would, although not within the scope of the Winding-up Acts, be altogether discharged and exonerated from such liability.

' Tbat, considering that this bank carried on business in nine different towns in various counties, the creditors are so scattered, and the debts of a great portion are of compara. tively small amount, and due to farmers and persons of the lower stations of society, it would under this Bill be p rantically in the power of a minority in value of the creditors to elect a representative favourable to the shareholders, and ro bind by a compromise an actual majority of the creditors of this bank. " That a copy of a privato Bill to wind un the affairs of this bank was doposited in the Private Bill-office of Parliament shortly previous to the late session of Parliament, which Bill was abandoned by the official manager in consequence of the dissent of the creditors of that bank unanimously expressed at public meetings of the creditors, and the provisions of that Bill were substantially similar to those of the present Bill.

This will liberate come 10,000 4een and their attendant trsports at Bushiro, and 10,000 /ien will sutice to put an end to the Chinese puzzle. Bat they must come soon. The Shanghai mail, which -came In yesterday, brought some serious advicos from 'Ia reorth. All the way from this, northwiard to our I furthest," it appears to be the general impression among 4hose best qualified by experionce to judge, that the delay -in the admirars operations aegainst Canton, caused by th-, ,perhaps very proper resolution to await the arrival of reinforcements, is creating immense mischief in the interior, and giving warranty for the report, industriously circulated hy the Cantonese, that we have been defeated and driven -away from the City of Hems (Canton). I do not know thct the gravity of this inteligenco from a -quarber where hitherto the long animosities of North and -South have wrought in our favour by supporting the prestige of our fame and fortane is much compensated by {the tidings, which are also come to hand, of great and im 'iurtuat advantages gained by the insurgent Emperor over ,ais rival of Pekin. If the Nankin Government is not jpersuaded that Canton is not impregnable to the skill and valour of the barbarians, the faU of the Tartar infJience w7ithin its walls will signify nothing, or worse than nothing -forthepurposesuf ouraiplomacy. The Vceroy Yeh has already shown ua what sacrifices of private affection and hatred he is capable of making to the grand policy -of keeping China to the Chinese Government. At the 'l-aking of Nankiu his wives, his children, and aU his house, were mnssacred by the Iconoclasts, who are now reigning -(here in the stead of his master, aud the decapitation of some '70,000 " rebels" by his order, at Canton, attets the sincerity -of his avowed love of vengeance. Yet their surviving %-rothrcn in arms and himself are now leagued in the commnon cause of " Canton for the Cantonese," and the Yellow 1)ragon of the "1 White Emperor" floats from the masthead of every war junk in the combined fleets on the waters of "tho "Pearl." It is but a transfer of allegiance from a '$ red" to a "- white" Emperor which these have made. It i7fll be but the converse transfer which those will make when Tai Pine's conquestshall have roUed onward to the .gates of the Viceregal Palace; and what Chinninan evec srefused to render that token of his acknowledgment to " the Divinely Appointed," whose commission from Heaven Is -attested by the people's desire and sealed by success ? Therefore, so far as we are concerned, I say of the late -conquests of the Nankin Government, valeant qtantum ealere possunt. But they certainly have not been smalL U is now confirmed-what before was vaguely rumouredthat the rebels of Kifingsi are in possession of the Chfing Yuh-Shz,n pass, which commands the only road from that T,rovinco into the fertile and rich maritime provinco of CheRefing ; that the western part of that of FOkien is in their ,hands, together with the mountain passes which lead into Xiangsi; that Kweiling-f(4 the capital of Kwfingsi, so long ;besieged in vain by the "God. worshippers" at the beginning of their rising in that their native province, has at length yielded itself, and become " a possession," and that two -of their chiefs haue actuaUy eotablished themselves in the morth of Kwangtung itself, while a third, their formidable Lo, at the head of some 60,000 men, who have followed him 'from Kwangsi into that province, has taken several of its -southern cities, and from the easternmost, Tekheng, now threatens a visit to Canton itself, the capital of the pro. vince, The intercepting of Chinese despatohes is the mos4 -caurious and perhaps the most importaut incident of the last fortnight. On the 6th inst. Commodore -the Hon. G. J. B. EllUiot, under orders from the admiral, proceeded on hoard of Her Majesty's ship -Sampson, with Her Majesty's ship Hornet and the .two tenders, Hongkong and Sir Charles Forbes, in company, to Deep Bay in quest of a fleet of war junks, which were engaged, as usual, in cutting off our supplies of -market produce from the main. The water being too shoal .,even for the tenders to approach within five miles of a saumber of junks which were discovered in a river high up the bay, the commodore, Captain Hand of the Sampson, and Commander Forsyth, of the Hornet, proceeded with the boats of the two last-mentioned steamers, and ,five other boats belonging to Her Majesty's ships *Sybille and Nankin, tsp the bay and into the river when the vessels, which proved to be the fleet they had c--ome in quest of, opened a heavy fire, sustained by that of -a large body of troops ashore, bat which was soon silenced by the steadier and more accurate fire of the British. Every vessal in the fleet, consisting of 11 war junks and -two well-armed lorchas, lately captured from their Euro.pean ownors, was burnt and their guns sunk in deep water, -it being found impossible to dislodge even the lorchas from -the beach where they lay. The lose of the enemy must have been great. A seaman wounded by the accideutal discharge of his own firelock was -our only casualty. A Portuguese who had been a prisoner of -the Chinese took the opportunity to make his escape, and was brought off in safety. It was on board of the " flag junk" at the end of this brilliant little affair that a quantity of Chinese manuscripts was found by the captors, and on examination these proved - to be a series of despatches, reports, edicts, and memoranda ;by different meiubers of the Sunoan District administration on the events of the last threo or four months of the pending controversy. Much of the correspondence will not interest your readers, since it consists of a criticism of the --characters of certain men, employed by the worthies of Kaulung to carry out their numerous plots against the " lives and safeties al " of this community. I shal there-fore merely state the results, so far as I have been able to -ascertain these beyond the possibiity of doubt. The " poisoning case" is referred to approvingly, but not so as to implicate the poisoners or to clear them, but -the burning of the store of the Englishman who, after their arrest, bought the poisoner's bread and biscuit bakery, -'and accepted the contracts by which the " devil soldiery" are fed, is the sabject first of a despatch approving the plan. -aud, when suocessful, of another avowing and glorying in it. Assassinations, kidnappings, eapture of vessels, are in like manner planned beforehaud, and boasted of after exe-oution. Attempts to commit them and other crimesamong which may be mentioned one to destroy a steamer and several to blow up the buildings and magazines of Victoria with gunpowder, are freely talked of, and -their failure or postponement faUy explained. The pains which Yeh, as you know, has been taking of late -to soothe public feeling at Canton into a belief that the "devils are broken" and "rubbed down," and suing for " leave to ask pardon," are also explained. His exchequer -isempty ! From the beginning of these troubles he had 'boen obliged to depend upon his " braves," as the " people -and gentry" were disinclined to bear the brunt of the action But the " braves" were not volunteers, and his donations were immense. Farther, considerable sums had been 4avished on the taking of heads, for the service was a .perilous one. To meet all these demands, forced, or else voluntary subscriptions were offered to the choice of the -discerning public; and the result was uaswerable, but only for a season. The money is all gone. The "' Canton Com mnittee " can no longer pay even for heads. In vain their -economy; in vain the reduction of reward from 100 to 30 -Uals, and.lower still; in vain their obstinate rofasal to pay -more for a service which the "braves" represent as too dangerous for a " brave " to undertake at less than double the amount !-they have been at length compelled to auspend *their payments altogether; and the adroitness of Yeh has 'been put in requlition to cover the act of insolvency with 'the cloak of magnanimous compassion for the woes with 'which the rude and obdurate barbarians have so long been punished. This inability or unwillinguess to pay for a war whioh your Exeter-hall-ites pretend to consider . war pro aris et focds, is one great fact. The small -force of "braves" is another. All the exertions in Yeh's power to make, when his treasury was at the fulest, only xalied a body of 1,000 men-even if there be no Chinese sexaggeration of number-to the defence of the town and dis. 'trict of Kaulutg. within sight and gunshot of our own hay. -bour, although the sehome of defence was combined with -one for the invasiou of this island and the destruction of our .scommounty. Anad now even this force is, for lack of Pay, ,on the point of being disbanded. Crimes and attempts to commit them continue, notwith. standing the announced deficit in Yeh's treasury. Sinee I last wrote the Mandarin's son who, having gained admis. sion as a eoolie on board of the Gulnare, induced the emigrants to make an endeavour, all but successful, to mnuder 1aer officers and crew, and take posseEsion of her, has suf dered the lhst penalty of the law. His 17 adherents, 'who ae to be transported for life, begged on bended knee lhat they might die with him. Was this the superstitious 'nfuenee of their secret association of blood? Or was it 4'he mere outbreak of the Chinese spirit, ever reckless of life and impatient of servile labour ? I incline to the feriner eolution. The even handed justice of England within two days rster their condemnation fell heavy on an European and 3bis Chinese accomplies, who were tried and convicted in' 'the same court of some very gross and cruel treatment of a garge body of Chinese coolies, wvhom, after deluding into a contract to go to Cuba, they thought proper to onfine, gialast their wills, for some threo weeks in a filthy tenement ashore. But I doubt whether the example has been of benefit to the malcontents. It is not possible for a Ch'eta mtan to hblieve in the purity even of acourt of justice. Coratiull Onwse and aggression haso not as yet diminisbhed. -A luos frightful murder has been committed upoa-one of the moat repected and oldeat mambers of the British mer. cantile conmmunity in China-the late Mr. Mfarkwich. The old man was found dead in his bedaat a very early hour in the morning, with his throat literaUy torn away by a violent band. From the articles of spoil found scattered on the floor it is plain that the assassins dreaded a surprise, and fled before they had time to ecure his head as a trophy. They were his own house servants, and had been with him many years. It was to " house servants" that an espeOial reward had been offered for the heads of their mrasters. A questonable violation of territory has at the hour I am now writing effected the capture of one of the miscreants. The Hoa. East India Company's ship Auckland, late in the day of the murder, was despatohed to Elem-tin, his native place, in quest of him. The " elders" were invited on board, and, on their hesitation to come, one half-hour's grace was given them to reconsider their detexmination. At the end of that time one of the Auck. land's 68-pound shot might be seen skimming over the viUage and kicking up a terrible dust beyond; whereuPon the Ham-tin mob were seen besetting the houses of the said " elders," and compelling two of -their number to yield themselves to the courteou8 invitation of Commander Drought. They came on board, and to ransom their village uadertook to surrender two of the assassin' relatives as hostages for himself, who, they said, had not yet arrived, from Hongkong. The undertaking wea fulfiled and the hostages delivered; and, upon an intimastion that the assassin himself was arrived at Ham-tin and in custody, the said hostages are to be re-embarked thither in a day or two in charge of the police authorities, there to be exchanged for the criminaL There has been an unsuccessful endeavour to cajole a Yankee steamer within the clutches of the Mandarins, and a like endeavour upon a Portuguese armed lorcha, which has succeeded. We have also had an attempt to blow up the stores and magazines at the Gun-yard. This discovery vws made on tho moraing of the 5th inst., a few hours before it was put in execution. All the workmen were immediately discbarged; but nothing transpired to lead to the detection of the real offender. By a happy inspiration, redolent of the Crimea itself, aU the Chinamen on board of the Minden hulk, where no powder is stored, were also discharged, while aU on board the kindred hulk Hercules, where are stored 40 tons of powder, they are still suffered to remain. Tho former were, for Chinamen, people of very high character ;thecharacter of the latter was,even for Chinamen, remarkably low. The rainy season is beginning. There is much sickness. Some deaths among the persons poisoned three months since with arsenic are apprehended. And what, you will ask, is the Emperor about? If wo are to helieve a late edict of Yeh, he approven highly all that the " brave" Viceroy and his " braves" have done, and as highly of his proposal to give us peace, and " not be vcry harsh with us," if we "really and of our own accord come round," and cease to "dare to be perverse as of old." if we are to believe the Viceroy of the northern ports, His hJajesty, neglecting Yeh, and Canton, and all besides, has bimself, really and of his own accord, oome round to the traffic in opium, which by edict is now admitted at Shanghai on payment of " the duty of 12 taubs per chest." It must not be forgotten that, in either instance, it Is the remote Emperor speaking thro ugh a present Mandarin; and all which can with safety be a rmed is that such a peace is anxiously desired by Yeh, and such a payment by his northerni fellow-servant; and for the same sordid reason, no doubt. P.S. 1 O'CLOcK, r.3r.-At the moment of closing the mal I open this letter to communicate a piece of intelligence, which has just reached me through some Chinamen, this mornilng arrived from Canton. They say-but who will vouch for them, albeit greatly confirmed by the facts above recorded ?-that the Imperialist army there is in a state of mutiny for want of pay, the soldiers deserting in crowds, and the misery and disaffection of tho population at the uttermost. Hongkong, April 15.
" JANE ZYBE" AND CUARLOTTB BRONTE. TO THE EED3TOI OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Will you allow me space to point out a few iadvertencies in the letter from Mr. Shepheard which appeared under the above heading in The Vimes of last Wed ne-day? Among the charges agan8st the Clergy DaughterBohool and its founder wTich Mr. Shenheard findg in She Life Charlotte Bronte, the first is that "the pupis were .aTfeo starved," and he implies that the charge is continued up to the present time by inviting "those who desire to know. the truth" "to visit the school itself," and have " their horrors of starvation" "pleasantly dissipated." In the book it is stated that the badness of the food during the tine when it was complained of was chiefly owing " to the bad management of a cook ;" that she was dismissed in consequence; and that "henceforward the food was so well prepared that no one couldever reasonably complain of, it." Even during the reign of this bad cook it is expressly explained-and it must have oost the authoress some pains to ascertain these details-that " there does not appear to have been any parsimony ;" that " the dietary, as shown in manuscript, was neither bad nor unwholesome, nor, on the whole, wanting in varietv ;" and that " Mr. Wilson himself ordered in the food, anA was anxious that it shouid be of good quality." Other charges found by Mr. Shepbeard in the hook are, that the pupils " were treated with habitual neglect," and that " the fever which broke out in the school was ' aggravated by the cruelty' of the heads of the establishment." The auitoress says of this time of fever, "Mr. Wilson supplied everything ordered by the doctors, of the best quality and in the most liberal manner, and even sent foradditionai advice in the person of a very clever medical man of Kirby; and she narrates the energetic marner in which he drove off tn fetch " a kind motherly woman," who " proved a most efficient nurse." The expression " rzgravated by the cruelty," kc.,is introduced twrice,as if quoted from the book. I cannot find it there. The only time when the word II cruelty" is used it is applied to the aot of a teacher, of which no one can read the accoaunt without feeling that it is truly told, and that it well deserved the term. Side by side with this anecdote, as if to qualify any too harsh impression that might he gathered from it, is placed a description of "the sweet dignity and benevolence" of the superintendent, "whom all that knew her appear to hold in honour," and who is stated to have "watched in her own rooin" over Elizabeth Bronti during " days and nights" of illiess. Respecting such points as the connexion of the fever with the bad food, and the influence of the whole school life on the health, mental and physical, of the Bronte girls, neither Mr. Shepheard's nor Mrs. Gaskell's opinion can be decisive, as the case does not admit of proof. Frobably no two medical men, on inquiry into it. would agree in their conclusions. It is, however, Mrs. Gaskell who points out, what Mr. Shepheard might not otherwise have known that, " the little Brontes, when they came, had only just recovered from a complication of measles and hooping-cough." And it is also she who states that " none of the girls who had the fever died at Cowan's-brldge," and that "none of the Brontes had the fever." Indeed, I think the anxious candour and carefulness with which the whole account of the school seems to be compile&must strike all ordinary readers. It is evidently written not to confirm but to correct the impression made upon the public by Jane Eyrre, an impression already existing, and which therefore rendered it necessary that the subject should be one into. With regard to Mr. Wi son himself, Ms Gaskell, while distinctly expressing her view of what she considers erroneous in his management, s,peaks of " the perpetual sacrifices of time and money" that he made to the school, of what "was noble and conscoentious" in his character, and of "' the great amount of good which he did by his constant, unwearied superintendence." Mr. Shepheard can scarcely have recalled these various passages when he desoribes Mrs. Gaskell as " vilifying a great and good man," and " holding up an admirable institution to public execration." Of the importance of the "inaccuracies as to minor details of fact" to which Mr. Shepheard refers, we cannot judge, as he does not tell us what they are. He would have rende.d a greater service to the friends of the school if he had, by pointing them out, enabled the aulhoress to correct them in a future edition. It remains true, no doubt, that Mr. Shepheard and M Gaskell form different estmates of the merits of the school and its founder. So, probably, do the pupils whom they have reqpec:tively consulted. Those merits I do not attempt to determine, nor would a newspaper be a fitting place to discuss them. I have merely sought to sho.v from the book itself, for I have no o1her sources of information at hand, that fr. Shepheard has singularly misunderstood the tone and bearing of the nacration, and that Mrs. Gaskell, whotber mistaken or correot in her results, has gone into the question with great fairness, conscientiousness, and care. Il Iam, Sir, yours obediently, E. S. . -V L.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIME& Sir,-I shall feel obligod if you will allow me to rectify certain inaccumrte statements which appeared in 2'ke Timus of the 28th inst., with regard to the causes of the accident which occurred Iately by the falling of an arch at Shnbdon-court. The areh in question was not one of an " extensive series under the house." It was a single arch built on the west front outside the house (over which was to have been simply a flat landing), and which was to be used as a zoal cellar. Of the sound principle on which the arch itself was constructed a short desenption wiM give a stfloient idea. It was a segment arch, the span was betweeu 18f U. and 19ft., and the rise from the springing to the soffit from 4ft. 6in. to 5flt. One of the abutments, above 3ft. thick, consisted of the main wall of the house, which rose aboont 35ft. above the springer. The other was a new wall 3ft. thick. the back side of whic resed aainst the natural soil. Neither of these, it shoed be sd Bare way, resting as they did noton any weak, imperfect, or "old" 'foundation, but on The facts of the case were these s-The arch was keyed in on the 23ad, and on the 25th the centre was slacked for three hours before striking, the prccess of which was nearly conk. pleted, when, without giving any kind of warning, the. arch fell. There is no question as to either materials or. worknauship ; both were of the best quality.

EDUCATION AND MOBALITY. TO THE EDITOR OF THIE TSE. Sir,-AU who are watcbing or at work upon the great social effort of the day-the amelioration of the morals of the nation-must agree in hailing with gratitude your ad.nirable remarks in Phe Aimes of to-day on the approaching educational congress, According to the present programme there is too much reason to fear that the dilettanti educationists will muster stronger than the workers, and that, after a series of platitudes and theories embodied in formal speeches and resolutions, the convention will break up, not merely se isifecf, but to the postponement and damage of that large induction which can onlybe accompliahed by an extensive and patient collection of particular facts. Your second leading articole on the recent report on the lodginghoases of London points to one wide but deeply interesting and hitherto comparatively unexplored field, to which the practical educationist must go for phenomena bearing directly on the science whose laws he is labouring to develope. From tho national school to the cheap and squalid lodginghouse a trunk line of railway has long beea open, with trains constantly running. What we want is' a competent and reliable traffic-taker? Now that every lod$iaghouse is under the inspection of the Commissioners of PoTIce these returns are easily attainable. For instance, why should not the Vice-President of the Committee of Council on Education obtain for the congress, from Mr. Reeves, the admirable inspector of lodginghouses, somesuch facts as the following. Of every hundred persons whose sole home from year's end to year's end is a twopenny lodgingbouse, how many in childhood attended a parish school? how many a Sunday-school ? and at what age did they leave achoolin each case? and why? Our parocbial clergy are graduaUy opening their eyes, I hope, to the fact that when they have got their Infant, day, and Sunday schools into full working efficiency (and in agricultural parishes how few can say so much as this?), their real work for and with the rising generation is only just begun. The clergyman must find ways of keeping the "young men and maidens" of his parish within reach of his influence after they have left his schools. The Young Men's Society and the Young Women's Class must be as integral a portion of parochial machinery as the day-school or Sunday-scbool if he would save very many of his flock fron that deccensus avesni of which only the police who inspect, and the few private persons who visit, common lodgngbouRes have any realized idea. Unhappily, cases are not few in -which poverty, not sellgenerated, has overtaken an honestr hard-working artisan, and, after stripping him of everything, has consigned him and his family to the low-psiced lodginghouse as his home for the rest of his life. Let an operative once sink so deep as this into the slough of pauperism raid his emerging is of the very rwrest occurrence. To depauperize a man, to raise "the poor from the dunghill," is emphaticaUy an attribute of Godhead. But for every blameless sufferer of this class there are at least 50 who have " made their own bed," and who did so between the ages of 16 and 26. Commerial enterprise has now found out that to provide first-class places of resort for sinful entertainment is a paing investment of capital. In a letter which Mr. Reeves. the gentleman above referred to has lately addressed to the Bishop of London, and which has since, I unrderstand, been placed, with his Lordship's sanction, in the hands of every London clergyman, the curtaiu is for a moment lifted. The following extracts show that schools of vice are being opened all around us, without grants in aid from the Committee of Conncil on Education, and that by the teachers in these the actual education of the working classes in the reat towns, at least, of England is wellnigh monopolzed:- Ofacial dutiesforsosie year past brnging me into unavoldable contact with almost au classes of p ersons in the metropoDis, from the most degraded and dUsreputable upwards, have foroed uron mo au acqualtance wih the morl evil that surrounds us which can be shared by only a few.

BLBOTION -ZNTELLIGENCE. RVI The election of a representaLtIv for thffs borough took, place yesterday in the presence of Mr. Harris, the returning offncer, and a good sprinkle of the eleotors. There wva anutter absence, of excitement, and the proceedings Were the'roughly quiet and orderly. Mlr. Mfoxci said, when a few months since they returned Mfr. Keating for the second time as one of the represent&. tives of Rteading they knew they were electing a gentleman of great legal attainments and hghL stauding at the bar--a erntlmn who, he believed, in every respect merited that c8hiaghapoi,ntment which Lord Palmerston had conferred upon him; btut they were not so fully aware aR they now were that Lord Palmerston would put the "1right snan irn the right place." (Chees)Intenmeo h Liheral electors of Reaaing he co not buLt congratulate thne hoen. and learned gentleman upon the high position he ha attained. He was quite sur that they would ratify the choice which Lord Palmerston had made ; and he wrould only add that he regarded it as an omen of goocl when a gentleman whom they had elected on account of his advanced Liberal opinions was promoted to a seat in the Government. It showedl that Lordl PAlmerston accepted the verdict given almost unanimously at the late election, andl proved, too, that he was determiined to carry out thoseo opinions himself. (Cheers.) Some important measures of reform had been brought under the notice of Parliament in t'he present session, and there was none in which assistance was more wanted than in law reform. (Hear, hear.) The state of the law in many particulars was very bad, and he was convinced that the same feeling which three centuries ago called for the reformation of oar religion would very soon, if the matter wvere not quLickly taken in hand, call for the reform in law. (Cheers.) There were many BUils before Parliament having that object in view, and he was sure that to the furthering of snch measures HerMajesty'snew Solicitor-General would give his ready assistance. He begged to nominate the Solicitor-General as afit and proper person to' represet this borough in P'arliament. (Cheers) Kr. DARTER, an alderman of the borough, secnded the nomination. Ne other candidate was named, and the MAYoR therefore declared the Solicitor-General to have been duly elected. The SOLICcToR-GxysMtALj WAS loudly cheered when the Mayor declared him to have been duly elected to ser;ve the borough in Parliament. He said, the acceptance of the high office to -which it had pleased Her Majesty to appoint him. by a jealous though wLse provison of our constitution, had caused him to vacate the trust which, under different circumstances, they had repoed In him, and sent him hack to his constituents to ask them whether they would ratify the choice that had been made. Themannerin which the appeal made to his constituents had been answered he never could forget. When heca6me t~othe townand communicatedlwith his friends and constituents he had the gratification of bein received with the greatestcordialit b*isrends, audwitt the grats courtesy and kidndness hyhis politicloponents. Haefetta he need hardly assure them that sc a recap. tion Was to him most gratifying, and he now stood once mnore, and for the third titme, by their uananimous voice, i what he had always declared to be, andl still consideredct be, the proudest position which a free citizen in a free country could possibly occupy. (Cheers.) The office in which he had been placed by Her Majesty was a high, responsible, and laborious one; but, high as wa-s the position in which that unmerited grace ha placed him, yet, when its effect was to vacate his position as a reipresentative of that borough, he felt that he had rather dlescended in the scale of soca osto. (Herr, hear.) Their kindness and confi-- deuce, hoswtevoer, had placed him in the proud eminence from whic hle was temporarily removed, aLnd he trusted that in the new situation in which he found himself he should justify the confidence which they had generously placed ini him. (Cheers.) Int oining the Government of Lord Palmerston h be ~lisve hen was contributing to that Liberal cause to which those who supported Isim were strongly attached. He believed Lordl Pa merston's Governmaent to be a Governmnent of safe and social progressa; it was a Governmnent which commanded the confiN'nce of the country, and which in the House of Commons commandedi a majiority that would enable the noble lord to carry into effect the measures which he proposed. The defect, if he might so say, in the Governments which immediately gtre- ceded his was that the want of strength prevented teir carrying through any measures of useful reform they wished to propose; but Lord Palmnetston, bae thought, possessed this great advantage, that the reforms which he and his Cabinet, on mature consideration, might propos they would be able to carry out into practical effect. The announcements which had aleay ben made by the noble Premier must, he thought, be most cheering to the hearts of the Liberal electors in that and other boroughis. Indeed, through the couLntry at large there scarcely seemed to be two opinons upon it. His Lordship hadalready introduced measures of most important social reform. He had announced his intention of settling several vexed questions. He had taken them in hand, and, ha doubted not, would carry them through. He had likewise announced to the country his intention not in the present session of bringing forward a measure which might be crude andl ill-con.- sidered, but of giving to the important question of I'arliamentary reform his best consideration from the end of the present Parliament so as to be in a situation in the following session for proposing to Parliament a really usefel measure of reform. (Cheers) That the measure which the noble lord would be prepared to propose would meet the w%ishes of all parties would be too muich for him to say, or even for any one to expect, hut that it would be a practical anid a useful measure of reform, no one who hAd marked. his progres since he had been at the head of the Government would entertain any doubt. (Cheers) The question of lawv reform, to, which his proposer had referred, was one in which he took a deep interest. The only.Parliamentary measure which he (the Solicitor-General) was fortunate persnlyto carry through Parliament had for its object that reor and he was happy to say that in the sphere for which it was intended it had fully answvered. (Hear.) A,lucb, undoubtedly, had been done of late years in the way of legal reform, but they miight accept the assurance of one who had studied the subject, and knew it, that mnuch Yet remained to be done. (Hear, hear.) He, however, could oLly say that to that subject, assisted by the able colleague whom he was fortunate to have in tho Attorney-General (a man whose abilities placed him in the highest position in the profession, and whose wishes on law reform were waell known), he should do his best to carry out any mneasur of reform that would improve the operations of the law. (Loud cheers.) The measures which had already been intro. duced by Lord Palmerston's Government in that directionl were cer,ainly of great utility and of immnense importance. They had passe, or would soon pass, the House of Lords, and would be oni the table of the House of Commons almost immediately after the re-assmbling of Parliament. He alludedl more particularly to the Bill for the reform of the ecclesiastical cour-ta. They were most of them aware of the very anomalous positioni of those tribunals. TheY were the remanants, in truth, of the ecclesiastical domination, It might be termed, which once existed. The officers ,who administered the law in those courts were not the Officers of the Queen, but were the officers of the archbishoPs and bishops. However excellent, amiable, and useful those prelates might be in their various spheres, there could be no donbt that the administration of so important a branch of the law-as should all law-should find its administrative source in the Crown, andanot in the prelates. (Cheers.) The Bill to which he had referred proposed to remedy that defect, and would make the courts which Wor to administer this branch of, the law Her Majesty's courts. The whole of the ecclesiastical supervison 'was to be swept away. They would become Hrer Majesty's courts, would ha open to all Her Majesty's sub. jecs wud be administered by officers chosen by Her Majestwy,uaInd under unquestionably a greatly improved system. Ha would not trouble them with the details of the mieasure, for he was sure they -would prove very tedious, and not tend much to enlighten them. But there was one feature in that Bil which he thought was entitled to consideration, and that was the transfer of smnall causes arising upon wils to the cheap local tribunals of counties, instea of continuing them in the high tribunals of the country, which to the poor mnan was a practic-al exclusion of his rights, (Hear, heir.) The important question of the law of divorce had been made the subject of another Bill, and it had passed the House of Lords. At all events, he believedathat it would shortly be brought down to the House of Comimons. That was undoubtedly an important question, involving as it did some of the dearest social relationshiPs. of life. When that Bill had been dluly miouldedby the careful consideration of both Houses of Parliament it would prove a very useful and expedient measure. There were other mneasures in progress which were not in such an adranced stage, and in the present session, which mnust necessarilY be short, they could not expect a very great deal to be done. He hoped, however, in the few months before them thst mnany useful mneasures would become the law of the land ; and it would not be the fault of the Government if other measures of an equally beneficial character were not initiated or brouight forward in the session wheN, the noble Premier had promised to introduce the great isaessure of Parliamentary Reform. (Cheers. Iit was impnssible that any mneasure would be brought forward that would please everybody; hut, looking at the present Administration as practical men. ho was satisfied it was such as couald best carry out the government of the country. (Cheess) There culd be little doubt of the advantage of the strenntIh of Lord Palmerston's Government. The very Bill to'SAicoh he hid referred- the Testamentary Jurisdiction Bi=--Was the most strikingillustration of the necessity of a stW1ng Government in carrying out useful measure, for that Bill, in various shapes, had been at least five or sigm tunes in Pailiacunt, someimesin he Huse f Cminss,.sometimes, in tas.

Ha did not like to promise too much, for ho woul?, rather thLat they should iudge of the probabilities of *his future doings in Parliasment from what he had alreadv doAe. He must say that he thought it was highly to the credit of the noble lord at the bead of the Government in maldng choice of the meo'ocer for Re&aing to be Her Majesty's Solicitor he bad sele'j d one who had never exhibited any unsoemly or servile adherence to Governme6t, but one who had always endeavor,red to maintain thoso liberal opinions upon the strengl of which he was originaly sent to Parliament, and ' hich he bBerieed he should be able to give the great est practical effect to in joining the Administration of the noble lord who at present enjoyed the coDfidenoe of the C' untry. (Cheers.) Three cheers were given for the Queen and the new Solicitor-General, and she proceedings terminated., LEE.DS. There are now two candidates fairly before the electors, Mr. J. R. Mills on the Liberal side, and Mr. G. S. Beecroft on the side of the Conservatives. The nomination has been appointed to tal;e place on Thursday and the poll on Friday. Mr. Beecroft, who was the chairman of Mr. Hall's oommittee at the late eleotion, resides at Kirkstall, near Leeds, and lately retired from the well-known Kirkstall Fibe Company. In his published address he says,- " Haying reUred from basinela, I should hae peferrd a private ation, but thenumseae calls WA 4a e soWt gleIA me no a&:eTOho bat to BMnml* rm at 7nurdLiosi I w bon andbedaoogk my o eoa bolili,, yAead within your boroUg. * Ulasw cigi e tbor of mod atoseeUt,n.

SPORTING INTELLIGEYCE. TATTERSALL'S. TTrESnAY- TIL DzmBY SEPrT\n. '±05ose who plaeed confidence in the sstufactory nature of the settling did not over-estimate tho peciniary strength of 'he Ring. The supplj of money seemed faUy equal to the lemand, and the complaints whibh were now and then heard were only those which might havebeen uttered on an ordi. nary occasion. StiUl it must bo confessed that the doubt4 wvhich had been enttertained in certain quarters had some foundation in troth and experience. Throughoat the winter months, down to the period of her defeat for the One Thousand, Blink Bonny had, with the exception of a brief interval of depression, been the leading favouritefor both thd Derby and Oaks, and in addition to being backed outright for her Epsom engage ments, she had been taken in many heavy double event bets which have " come off," and whicb, owing to the mazus retrogression, the takors bad little opportunity of hedging. The cause of Blink Bonny's losing her pride of plaeC in the Turf-market has been' traced to the suspicion under which she was placed at the beginning of the year, and naturally to tho disgraceful defeat which she sustained at Nevwmarket. The ingenious explanations, however, which have been furnshed respecting both crunmstances haey scarcely satisfied those persons who regulate their investments in ccordance with the publicly tried merit of horses, and who now shake their heads incredulously when the " unfitness " of Blink Bonny for the One Thousand is talked about, and who state, with a good show of reason, that 6 to 4 is not ganerally laid upon horses that are " dead amiss" for a race in which thoy are likely to bo opposed by any animal that has the recommendations of health and soundness. People, however, who are disappointed and lose their money 20dl say hard things which may not be justifiable. The approaches to the Subscription-room were of course occupied by a miscellareous crowd of persons. Although the police were on the alert, yet we regret to state that one gentleman had his pocket picked of above 50OZ.

The classes were above 35 tons for the first, and exceeding 20, and not exceedisg 35, for the second; and the prizes a very beautiful piece of plate, value 100 g AZneas, for the first named, and a prize of half the value for the seoond. Tho. first of these was a richly-chased silver tankard and cover, ornamented with nautical sutbects* and the second clara prize arichly-chased silver.gilt claret Jug, ornamented with festoons of flowers, vnth six sWlver-gilt clret cups to match. In order as much as possible to equalize the yachts, half a ,inute per ton was allowed by the larger to the smller in each class. t t The noble Commodore, Lord Alfred Paget, came onboard the Prince of Wales at London-bridge, and was shortly' afterwards isdned by Mr. R. Green, the eminent shipowner, the Vice-Commodore. The steamner with her freight, conuistin of nearly 400 persons of position in society, proceed direct to Erith, where the above-named yachts were fonnd at their stations. At 11.32 a gun was fired for the start, and within a minute the spars of the contending craft were covered with canvass, all exhibiting praiseworthy alacrity. Tho Phantom was first round, and the Cyclono first set her topsail, but all went out admirably, good wide berths having been allotted to them. The Extravaganza, which, by nature of her position, laid well down the Reach, took the lead, follow bay the Cyclone, the others making a short trip. The wind was very variable, sometimes blowing out entirely from the southward, and at other times both to the east and west of it, and it need hardly be sawa that under such circumnstances leewvard boats suddenly became advantaged more than they had expected, an,d that others experienced corresponding disadvantages. Fetching into Porfleet the Prince of Wal}s, well handled by Captain Williams, her master, came level with the craft, and afforded the company an opportunity of seeing the yachts beat thron h Long Roach They opened with the Extravaganza, 300 yards a-head, next the Cyclone, thenthe Emmett and the Mosquito, next came the Glance, then the Thought. Under theCbalk-hill the Thought was just ahead of the Phantom, but there was not wrind enough to suit either of them. At Greenhithethey were in the followingorder:-Extravagau7a first, Emmett second, Thought third, Mosquito fourth, Plhantom fifth, Cyclone sixth, and in this order they continued for some time, the Extravaganza gradually oceeping further ahead, and being half a mile in advance at Gravesend of the sternmost, the Silver Star, of which but little was afterwards seen. The Emmett was second at OrGeveserd, but the Thought and Mosquito were closetogether engaged iu a very animated race for the third place, which wao-a little lower down acquired by the Mosquito, who then began to overhaul the Emmett, which she passed off the Chapman to leeward, and then, foot by foot, lessened the gap-between herself and the Extravaganza, with which she came abreast about a mile and a-half above the Nore Light, which was the distanre.post at which they were to turn. After one ineffectual attempt to leeward, the Mosquit9.passed into the first place, to the great delight of those who, speculating upon more wind, had freely hacked her before the day of the race. They rounded the Neor vessel inthe following time and order: Mosquito2..2 30 40 -xt-a,aganza 2 31 3G EmmOtt .2 32 32' Thought 2 37 4V The others were not timed. The time for the start-r hAd been so well chosen that the vessels rondeda at dead low water, and as the wiud was pretty much the same for coming back as it had been for going dowsn there was no occasion to alter rig, and, with the most trifling exception, they continued under the same canvass. Throughout, the wvhole way up, although the wind ever and. anon shortened, the Mosquito held her lead, sometimeo. bv more, somefimes by less, but as she had to allow theo ltravaganza five mimutes the interest and excitementk was maintained till very near thefinish, it being extremen questionable wiether there was that timo between thein reltive positioa In coming up to Gravesend the Thougob showed symptDoma of getting into the third place, whichishe sooa. obtainedi and the race finished sa foUlows EL m. s Mosquito (winner, Ist clas) - - .. ..

MA2NCRESTER BMBITIQK o ART *' E..lBS.' - - There is still a gradual inproveotent'in the attendance. On Monday.the admissionr were, by season tickeb, 798; by cash, 8,716 i total, 9,514. of thes 4,(224 arrived by railwasy. This was an increase of L913 shilling payments over Saturday, when the cash admissions exceeded those of any previous day. Yesterday, up.to 3 o'clock, the admissions were eatimated to be equal to those of the entire previous day, showing a further improvement. A very large proportion wtre working people, atid although many of tbese, having a very linmited period to divide, as holyday people, between the Exhibi.ion and other sources of enjoyin4 lefI early, a greater number manifested ai appreciation of the pictures and statuary, by-de*oting many hours to a careful study of them. The musical perfOrinanceas were on a more extended scale, dtvided into six parts, thb first two by the organ, including compositions from Eaydn, Wely, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Auber, and Avison; the two next by the usual select orchestra of inatrumentalists, from the works of Mozart, Jacoby, Meyerbeer, Mendelsolm, Rossini, Grosse, and Donizetti; and tho. two, concluding parts on the organ, from Wely, Haydn, XMozart, J. S. Bach, Auber, and Handel. The space under the organ galery has now been cleared by the removal of the great orcbestra erected for the opening ceremony, the walls being now covered by some fine specimens of tapestry., Some fine old carvings are also placed tbere, and some specimens of antique furniture in wood and earthenware from the Soulages Collection, with old sculpture and other works of art, Mr. Donald has extended his accommodation by the opening of a fine coffee saloon, running paralel with the southern picture-gaUery, and in a day or two it wiU be extended to a total length of 430 feet, with a communication so that the visitors can enter from the transept.

INAUGURATION OF CALTHORPB PARK. After the proedings at the inauguration of Calthorpe, Park, Birminghama, of whichx an acouant appeared.in The Times of yesterday, there was a banquet at Doe's Hotel, at which upwards of 200 gentlemen 'were present.

FOEIGON INTELLIGRNCR. FF.AmuJB. (roz0 oUx OWN ooRMPoNDNT.) -- - - - - I jAplor of the fo1ovdinSDppe&d In our sevondedition of .eItv:-1 - ARD% MONDAY, JUKE 1, 6 P.M. In the last number of the Joumal des Ecowmses an article appears from the pen of x Michel Chevalier, reviewing a book published by M. Lequien, a member of the late Legislative Body. X Lequien is a prohibitionist of the first water, and his production repeats the argumenta so comnmonly used y the school to which he belongs, and which have been so often exposed and refuted. M. Ohevalier's article, which has been republished as a pamphlet, once more examinea the prncipal argaments of the prohibitionists. The following are extracts:- "I bavo prad A LequieN" says M Chevalier, " for the moderation of his arguments. I am, however, compelled to observo that there is ono subject upon which he has mEned himself to be controlled by pason. That sabject is England, of which it must be said in his favour, as an extenuating circumstance, that no prohibitionist can possibly speak with tamper. It is agreod among them that Englnd wntches our manufactures in order to devour them. According to the prohibitionists, England is something like tlhe beast inthe Apocalypse which personifies all perfidy, nll infamy, all abomination. The great commercial reform to which Sir Robert Peel attahed his name is but a de3perato expedient imagined by the profound cunning of those wickod islander Zi. Lequien consequently endeavours at great length to depict that reform as an inddious mnmceuvre intended to deceive other nations. IEe has ten chapter on this polnt, without counting a multitude of pssages and sentences scattered through the body of the work. At other periods, and under other circumstances, English policy has been mistaken, It has been occas.mally selfish and unjust, but even in that repect a philosopher who would plae3 himself abovo tho agitations of Cabinets and nations, to judge them impartially, would very probably find that all others resemble it. But in her legislation on international commerce perfldious Abion has deserved well of tho human raoe. She has tried on herelf a bold, difflcult, and at that moment a very perilous, experiment. She tried It, notwithstanding the impasioned and energetic resistance of several of her great manufacturers and of the agricultural body-the most considerable of all, whlch appesred not tbo b in a state ever to support the shoock of foreign compatition, for it producod expensively and sold at an extravagant price, of which It might have boen believed that it would be impossible to deprive itsef. It dld so, notwithstanding the opposition of a considerable portion of its miners and of some branches of the manufacturing class. It procoeded to do Eo with that calm decided, and imperturbable resolution, which Is, perhape, the most admirable quality of the British character. Her statesmen, elevating themselves to a height which has been rarely reached in any country, acoomplished these Customs' reforms by shaking off the prejudices of an antiquated polltical economy, to adopt another which counts among its authors great and noble intellects, the Adam Smiths, the Franklins, the Turgots, and which is in intimate connexion with the immortal principles which France honours under the name of the principlea of 1789, but which at that period were not practised by the great States, then obstinate prohibitionists. They demanded no reciprocity from any other State,and they effected the change quickly, rnsting to the intelligence and activity of indivl. dual to' triumph over difficulties-not, however, without offring to the agriculturhi3s during the transition tho efficacious aid of the State. It is an eternal honour to their country and te themselves to have abjured traditions that were called patriotic, bocause they wern narrow and meanthat were deemed prudent and conservative, becuse they respected untenable monopolies, and perpetuated, in the interest of a few, abuses which were injurious to the masn of the nation; and if at this day the memory of Sir Robert Peel is revered in the two hemispheres-if, in conformity with the dearest wish of that great Minister, his name is quoted with blessinRs 'at the firedde of the poor, not only in Great Britain, but elsewhere,-it is in acknowledgment of that great reform accomplished with so just an appreciation of the public interest, and with such noble firmness in the midst of storms-a noble example, which will not be loot on Governments in whose way private interests heap up obstacles similar to those which Sir Robert Peel removed with a hand so firm and a mind so iatelligent. Already on a!l sides, except inFranoo, we eso a moderately free system of trade adopted as the goal towards which the commercial legislation of nations is moving. Prohibition is universally repudiated as irreconcilable with the spirit of modern times. In England and the Zoflverein it has ceased to exist. Russia has adopted a tariff much more liberal tlhan ours With her, prohibition is confined to two or three articles, and everbody knows that she is prepaing to publish a new taiff yet more liberal" Commercial affairs in Paris last week, although not as active as at the same period in previous years, were tolerably remunerative. The retail shops in the departments having exhausted their stocks, have sent forward orders to the manufacturers, which are found satisfactory. The country shopkeepers reckon on a good season, as the crops promise well, and when the peasants gather in an abundant harvest they indulge in many comforts w hich they deny themselves in lees prosperous seasons. The accounts from the manufacturing districts are likewise more cheering. With the exception of the manufacturers at Rouen, who complain that they coinot find purchasers for their cottons at prices in proportion to the cost of the raw material, sales are said to be very fair. Trade is also active in Alsace, at Roubai2, Tourcoing, and other towns in the north. The lJyau manufactures have received numerous orders from Paris, but they complain that their old customes in the United States are behind time. The Americans are probably waiting for the 1st of July, when the new tariff will come into force, and the existing duties wil be considerably reduced. Apprehension seems to have ceased in the southern departments 'with respect to the health of the siUkworm. The accounts of its progress towards maturity are reassuring. Nevertheless, there is no decline in the price of silk, inasmuch as it Is known that, even ehould the next silk crop be abundant, it wil not be sufficient to supply the general deficiency of stock. It further appears that the China and Bengal silk manufactured at Lyons has not given satisfaction. Complaints from the consumers are said to be so numerous that the manufacturers will in future confine themselves as much as possible to the working of European silk. The accounts from the wine-growing districts continue favourable. The vines are everywhere flourishing, under the influence of the late hot wedther, and, if no accident occurs to prevent the grapes from arriving at maturity, a more abundant vintage may be expected than tor some years past. Nevertheless, prices are higher at Bordeaux, in consequence of the scarcity of certain descriptions. Spa ish wine, which arrives in large quantities, is quoted at Cette at 70f. the hectolitre. The demand for spirits of wine distilled from beetroot is limited, and sales are difficult. In the Paris corn-market during the past week prices have undergone but little alteration, the tendency for flour being, however, rather upwards. The four marks were at 75f. and 75f. 50c. the sack, with inferior qualities in proportion. Wheat waa at 43f. and 43f. 50e. for the first quality, being somewhat lower; the red, at 41f. and 41f. 50. ; and that from Picardy at 38f. 50c. to 40f. 50c. In the country markets there has been but little change. The price of meat for the first fortnight of the pre_ent month is fixed as follows :-Ox beef, 1st class, 2f. 3c. the kilogramme; 2d, lf. 63c.; 3d, If. 23c. ; 4th, 92c.-all 2&. higher.

The price of bread for the ame period is fixed at 44e. the 21b. loaf frst quality. A new kind of manure has been invented by MW. Bichis, a gentleman of some note in the agricultural world. It is a chymical composition, the nature of which is stil kept secret by the inventor - but its mode of application is rather curious, the grain intended to be sown being mechanieally eoated with the compound previously to its being consigned to the earth. The rich principle being thus in immediate contact with the sed to be d- veloped, the soil needs no other kind of manure. Four pounds of the compound are sufficient for an acre of land. According to MW. BichWs' experiments, the application of his manure would raise the precenlt yield of France from82,000,000 heetolitres of wheat to 410,000,000. lDr. Stockhard, Professor at the Academy of Thaxand, in Saxony, has lately pronounced in favour of this sytem.

BELGIUML We have reoeived the Belgian papers of Monday. Tranquillity appears to be restored, but a portion of the CivicGuard a still under armg at Brussels, and troops are ready for. any emergency. Some 70 persons had been arrested, but the greater part of them have been cet at liberty. At Liege, where the windows of the Bishop's palace were smashed by a volley of stones, the excitement is also sutiding. The reports from Mons, Ghent, Antwerp, and other towns in the provinces are also of a tranquillizing natue. At the adjournment of the Chamnbers on Saturday at Brussels the President, after reading the decree for the adjournmnent, proposed t hree cheers for the King. The members of the Left rose and cheered, while the members of the Right did not respond to the appeaL. AUSTPIA. (InOc OUR OWN CORRESPONDE".) VIENNA, WAY 30. Tn the evening of yesterday the following official telegraphic despatch was received from Hungary:- "DEBRECZIN, M&Y28. "Their MAjesties, who quitted Grosswardein at 8 o'clock this morning, reache;d this town at 11, and were received with great pomp and ceremony. "'Unfortuately,theiMajwe8toleot,ontheiriMvllhoer, that there was an arming aggravation in the malady of thiArchducheeu Sophia, and they therefore resolved to receive the nobility, authorities, and oorporations without loss of timc, and to leave at 2 o'cock, 'withl the most necemay part *of their suite, for Czsge (on the Theiss), where a steamer v7as in waiting for'them. The Imperbl travellers Wi pro. bably be in Buda to-morrow at noon." The bulletins published at Buda on the 28th,. which only reached this city last night, ran as follows BEUDA, MAY 28, NooN. "The Arocduchess Sophia has quietly slumbered durlng the whole morning. The, slow development of tho com. plaint, and the co nsequent weakness, plainly indicate that the proces of 'teehn is still going on. " 6 O'CLOCK P.r. "The sickness of the Archduchess Sophia in the morn. ing, vhich vrould seem to indicate that the mucous mem. brane of the stomach is affected, has ceased, but the sink. iisg of the strength of the patient continues." As you, were this morning informed by electric telegraph, the poor child, who was rather more than two years old, died yesterday evening, between 10 and 11 o'clock (the Wiener tg of this evening says at half-past 10). It is tobe supposed that the afflicted parents were at their little daughter' bedside during the last day cf her life, butthe statement of one of the moring papers that they reached Buda in the evening of the day of their departure from Debreezin can hardly be correct. As authentic information has been received that their Majesties will be in their residence at Laxenburg, near this city, at 4 o'clock this afternoon, the rumour that the little Archduchess Gisella is again so ill that she cannot be removed from Buda cannot be true. It is to be expected that the Imperial tour through the northern districts of Hungary will be adjourned sine die. During the last week the General Asemblies of the Northern, Western, and State (AustroFrench Company) Railroads met. The gross receipts of the Northern Railroad during the year 1856 wore 12,212,589. 15k.; the expenses were 4,723,830f. 35k.; the taxes, 436,977fl. 7k. - and the 5 per cent. interest paid on the shareB and bonds 2,443,686fl. 8k.; the net receipts were, therefore, 4,608,095fl. 25k.; out of which sum an extra-dividend of 10 per cent. was paid to the shareholders, making 4,568,4456l.; the remaining 39,650fl. 25k. were added to the reserve fund, which on the lat of January, ]857, was 2,008,534fg. 51k. The only important resolution taken by the asembly, which consisted of but 129 persons, was to petition the Emperor to permit the Northern Railroad Company to cede the line from Oswiecim or Cracow to Przemysl to the Eastern Railroad Company. At the General Assembly of the Western (Empress Elizabeth) Railroad it was resolved that 50,000,000fl. instead of 65,000,000f. should be raised, and after a warm debate it was decided that the Administrative Board should be empowered to buy up at par, and on account of the company, shares to the amount of 15,000,000f. One member of the Board was of opinion that it ought to be empowered to purchase the shares at the lowest possble price, but the assembly considered his motion " ir-moral " and shares, which would probably fall ., 90 if not " bolstered up," are to be bought at the price at which they were issued. During the sitting it trauspired that a contract for the rails had been coneluded with A. Lindheim, one of the two gentlemen to whom the concession of the railroad was given. Although the Supreme Commando of the Army has not yet settled what line is to be taken between M6ok and Linz, Count Wickenburg, the President, stated that the works would probably ba finished within the stipulated period. The gross receipts of the State Railroad C' ompany (Anstro- French) during the year. 1856 were 14,137,000., ' and the expenses 7,372,000fl., which is about 51 6-lOths per cent. To the net receipta of the railroad, amounting to 6,928,054fl., was added 648,857L. (the revenue derived from the domains and machine factory), making a total of 7,576,911fl. The original capital was 200,000,000f but since the company has been formed " priority' bonds for 82,500,000f. and for 17,500,000f. have been issued, which were taken by the French Cr6dit Mobilier. It waas resolved at the General Assembly to issue new " priority" bonds for 80,000,000!.0 which sam is said to be necessary for the completion of the works. After 10 per cent., as the tantitm of the 20 members of the Board 5 per cent, interest on the capital, and 348,0001. for the reserve fund had been deducted from the net receipts, the remainder was divided among the shareholders at the rate of 30f. per share (of 500f.) The revenue of the domains and mines, which represent a capital of 18,000,000l., was only 1 2-3ds per cent. The (st-Deutsche Post of this morning has a very well written article on the subject of the Eastern iFrancis Joseph) Railroad. Some months ago 30 per cent. was paid np on a capital of 160,000,000f., and the whole sum, 45,000,000f., was lent to the Crdit Mobilier at Paris, " which has probablyused it for the mise en. sche of the Russian Railroad speculation." The Vienna aper aska whether the Credit Mobilier deserves such implicit confidence that the Board of the Eastern Railroad Company is justified in lending to it a large capital on which 5 per cent. interest is guaranteed by the Austrian Government I Mr. R. Stevens, the British Consul at Teheran, whose arrival here this morning with the ratified Treaty of Peace between Great Brtain and Persia I have already announced to you by telegraph, will leave forLondon this evening. Mr. Stevens, who was Consul at Tabriz for two years, will probably be able to give some good information to Her Majesty's Government relative to that part of the great caravan-road which the Rumians have recently obtained from Persa On the 25th the Pope, after having publicly given his apostolic bless}ing to the inhabitants of Ancona, left for Isisi, which place he reached before noon. His subjects well know that Pius IM is a kindhearted man, and consequently their reeaption of him has been co-rdiaL. There is no change in the ste of Mhal Radetzkys health. RUSSIA. (ntos ova nannLu ooan5roIrDxT.) BERLIN, MAY 3L From the very few private letters received from RuKa the conclusion must be drawn that, unje all the 'writern are very far wroDg in their surmise and statementa, te publication of a new taiff in Ruses has been put off sine die, and the otly amount of alleviation to the almos5 prohibitory duties of Russia wi coasist in the diminutiona of dnty and increased facillties of Custom-house busiinse itroduced during the late war. I have? however, not been able to meet with any positive information either on this subject or as to the cause of this deviation from the original intention; but I fear there is every probability of the uns2tisfactory statement of the indefinite pOstponement of the new tariff being correct, and that it ia to be attributed to the lamented death of M. Tengoborslii. It would appear also that the decease of this enlightened economist is in great measure the result of his unremitting labours in the field of statistics and political economy. A private letter from St. Petersburg informs me that the Emperor will leave there on the 13th of June, together with the Emprews, who is about to repair to a German spring; they will land at Luibeck, and then proceed in the first instance to Darmstadt, the Empress's native place; after a short stay there the Emperor will take the Empress to Kisingen, where she is to drink the waters, and, leaving her there, will go on to Wildbad, where the Empress-Mother will by that time be. After waiting over the 13th of July, which is the Dowager Empress's birthday, the Emperor and his mother will come on to Potsdam, and stay for some time with the Royal family at Sans Souci. The Emperor will be accompanied the vwhole time by Prince Gortachakoff the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Empress herself, having to bestow a lengthened time on her course of bathing and drinkig the waters, wil not return to St. Petersburg till September. The chbritening of the last-born Prince, the little Grand Duke Sergius, is fixed to take place June 7th. While on his visit to his mother at Wildbad, the Ermperor will repair to Stuttgard to see his sister the Grand Duchess Olga married to the Crown Prince of Wurtemberg, and while there it is affirmed that he will have a meeting with the Emperor Louis Napoleon, who will between! the middle and end of June be in the neighbourhood of Stuttgard. The Grand Duke Constantine is expected to return to St. Petersburg in the course of June by way of Stettin. The Grand Duke Nicholas, who is stil engaged in his official duties in Poland, will probably soon be relieved by the return of Prince Gortschakoff, the Stadtholder, to his post. As soon as he has finishedthe inpection of the fortresses on the Vistula, the Narew and the Bug he will proceed to join the Emprews-?other at Wildbad. The Emperor is expected to visit Warsaw towards the end of August. In spite of all the flaming accounts we get from St. Petersburg of the rapid development of Russinn enterprise, of the enormous maguitude of her capitil hitherto lying dormant, and of the ample amounts readyto be devoted torailways, &c., jointstockcompanies do not prosper there. Not only is the whole number of projects put forward not cied into execution, but even those oompames that have been formed seem to have great dificulty in holding their ground. For instance, the com. pany formed in 1851 for the salvage of ships and cargoes has made such a bad business of it that it is now being w up, leaving the shareholders very considerably iznimus. The Association for Mutual Insurance against Damage by Rail has been striving for several years to struggle into existence, but in spite of the patronage bestowed on the project by Prince Suwaroff it remains a failure. SPAIN. (FROM OUR OWN CORRPsONDIN.) MfADRID,LY 28. I perceive that in the House of Commons on Friday night last, when the subject of the Cuban slave trade was brought forward, Lord Palmerston, after ironically intimating the worthlessness of Spanish promises and professions concerning it, added that, as far as exhortation went, no exertions should be spared to repress the trta;fic. This will hardly satisfy those persons (and I apprehend that they are numerous) who think that Spain should not be allowed continuaUy to violateher pledges and abuse British forbearance. It were better to say at once that the matter is trifling, and will be treated in like manner. To say that a Government has been breaking its promises and conniving at the violation of treaties for the last score of years, in spite of constant remonstracees, and that, fruitless as these have proved, fresh exhortations shaU be the only mean resorted to of inducino it to alter its line of conduct, is surely a mere begging of the question. Lord Palmerston does not expect -and his owon words admit as much-that anything will be gained by the courEe he proposes to continue. Spain is accustomed to make game of British Governments and of British subjects. She has swindled her creditors, and she is every day swindling England out of the large sum paid to her in returm for her unfulfilled promise to prevent the importation of slaves into Cuba; and she has become so used tomake light of her engagements towards the English Government, whose patience she attributes to other motives than that forbearance which is an attribute of conscious strength, that nothing short of a very energetic demonstration wil bring her to a sense of her duty. Gunboats, a naval X.P. states, are too hot for the latitude of the Antilles; but it is to be presumed that our navy possesses vessels of Eome kind or other adapted for the service in question, or for any service that it may be deemed necessary to perform. If not, or if it be not thought proper to resort to such means, you may rest assured that the evil complained of-although occasionally, as now, the scandal it causes may become so great as to compel its temporary abatement-wiU continually revive, and wil last as long as our Government confines itself to " exhortations," which, it well knows, are wholly ineffectuaL The recaU of General Concha is stiU talked of as certain, although some persons think that the Government may, perhaps, in pursuance of the conciliatory policy announced by General Narvaez, -avoid dismissing him, and await his resignation, which is expected as a consequence of some severe communications that have been made to him. The time at which his period of office in Cuba expires is now so near that peremptorily to recaU him might be taken for an act of vengeance, provoked by h s brother's hostile demonstrations against the Government. In truth, however, there are abundant and valid motives for dismissing him, even with disgrace. As you may suppose, we are here kept minutely informed of what goes on in Cuba by numerous letters and frequent arrivals fromthat island. Recent accounts give details of the scandalous manner in which Don Jose Concha, Marquis of the Havannah, has encouraged, for his own advantage, the importation of negroes. In the early days of this (his second) comrmand in Cuba he sursued te slave trade with extraordinary rigour and activity. Cordons of troops were established on all sides, and frequent domiciliary visits were made to the plantations. When this vigilance and severity had produced their effect, and, owing to the rarity of the article, the value of negroes had nearly doubled itself, the Captain-General suddenly relaxed the rein, and connived at imnportation, on condition of receiving four ounces per head for each negro, instead of two, with which his lredecessors had contented themselves. It is estimated that 10,000 slaves have been brought into Cuba during his command there, and that he has made about 800,000 dollars by the transaction. To this enormous sum must be added, it is said, others also very considerable, received in the form of p,ots de vi, in other words, bribes,for preferences and protection granted to particular enterprise So that Gener%l Jose Conchas, who is noted for his parsimony, will return to Europe with arprincely fortune. Not being n the spot, I of couse cannot guarantes the correctness of these particulars, but I give them to ytu on the faith Of accounts from Cuba, trustworthy, as I believe; and it may be added, that they accord with reports long cunrent, with the frequent complaints latey addressed to the British Cioverument, and, through Lord Howden, to that of Spun, and alGon that they seem generally credited here. I they be true, thsole quality that appeared to render General Concha eligible for the supreme command in Cuba, namely, his probity, melts away d Of the poaeslonof superor otatid and esp lly of haainietrative knowledge, I believe he has never been accused. In a widely-crculated foreign newspaper I see a statemnent that Senor Gonzales Bravo, during his short reidence in London, promieed the holders of the coupon certificates to get their claims recog- nized by the Spanish Governmnent, and that Miisters intend shortly to submait the question to the Cortes. This statement is incoret It will be found that Senor Gonzales Bravo, although he may not have thought it necesr to deprive the ill-treated creditors of all hope of a settlement, does nuot admit having given any pledge of tie kind above indicated Moreover, one of t he Ministers explicitly declared, a few days ago, in thie Cortes, that the Government had no intention to bring forward the question of the coupons; and if the Government did desire to settle those claims, the way to do it would not be to bring them before the Cortes, which would assuredly reject a pro. position for their adjustment. If anything is contemplated, any tardy measure of justice, it must be done after the session is over; then the Cabinet can do pretty much as it pleases in such matters, and it would certainly be a feather In the cap of General Warvaez if he conceded that justice which the Progresistas, while priding therselves on their probity, showed themselves resolute not to grant. It appears that the best way to be well received In Spain is to treat the Government of the country with contempt during a series of years, as Russia has done. Prince Galitzin is treated here like a prodigal son just returned from the error of his ways. His journey through Spain from the coast was a series of ovations; and to-night the Queen gives a grand banquet in his honour, at which' will be present the Ministers, the Diplomatic Corps,.and the high functionaries of the Palace. Such an honour, done to a foreign envoy, is unprecedented in the annals of Spanish Courts. On Sunday Lord Howden will give a grand entertainment to his new colleague. Captain Wright arrived here on the evening of the 2-th inst., with despatches from the Foreignoffice. The rapidity with which the Queen's messenger perform this journey is striking to those who remember when it was a 10 days' busmess, whereas novw the time expended in actual travelling, deducting a day's stay in Paris and with a very moderate allowance of horse-power between Bayonne and Madrid, is about 90 houra. It is said that General Serrano's resignation of the Paris Embassy has not yet been accepted. The Three per Cents, were done at 40.5; ditto, Deferred, 25.90.
THE PUBLIC RBALTE. (From the Registrar.Genera'a Wekly Retur.) The returns from the metropolitan districts exhiblbt a further decrease in the weekly mortality. The deaths which in the two previonu weels were 1,050 and 948, were in the veek that ended on Satmrday 915. In tho 10 years 1847-1856 the average] number of deaths registered in the weeks corresponding with last week was 972; but, as the deaths of last week occurred in an increased population, the average must be raised for the purpose of comparison in proportion to the inmrease, in which case it will become 1,069. Hence it appears that last week was so favourable to the health of London that the number of ita inhabite ants who died was less by 154 than that which would have been placed on the registers if the average rate of mortality had prevailed. During the last three weeks the mean temperature of the air has been 58 deg., or nearly 14 deg. higher than it had been in the three weeks preceding. The deaths arising from diseases of the respiratory organs continue to decrease ; the numbers retumed in the ladthree weeks 'were 202, 167, and 139. Bronchitis, one of the diwases in this class, was fatal in the same times in 102, 84 and 67 cases; pneumonia, or inflanmation of the lung in 75. 66, and 56 cases. The deaths referred to phthisis, or con. sumption, which is placed in the tubercular class of diseas, were in the last three weeks 153, 118, and 124. This disease was less fatal last week than usual, for under the average rate of mortality the number would have been 150 instead of 124. With reference to diseases of the zymotlo character, it may be stated that whoopingcough is decidedly more fatl than is usual at the end of May. The deaths caused by this complaint rose again last week from 56 to 71; the average is 46. Only one death from smallpox Is recorded, and not more than 16 from scarlatina, 30 from typhus and common fever, 17 from diarrhsea, three infants from syphilis. Two persons died from lead poison. Six nonagenarians are returned, all women except two. The age of the oldest did not exceed 92 years. Last week the births of 846 boys and 856 girls, in aU 1,702 children, were registered in London. In the 10 correspond. ing weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,436. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29597 in. On Saturday the reading reached 29-91 in., the highest in the week. The mean temperature of the week was 569, which is 19' higher than the average of the sAme week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The mean daily temperature exceeded the average on every day of the week, though generally only to a small extent. The highest reading of the thermometer in the week was obtained on Thursday, and was 74'; the lowest occurred on the same day and was 42.9°. The entire range of that day, and also of the week, was 31-1. The highest in the sun occurred on Saturday, and was 95'. The mean dew-point temperature was 48^2 deg., and the dif. ference between this and the mean air temperature was 81 deg. On the first five days the wind was generally in the south-west; on the last two in the north-east. The rain in the week was 0-}2 in., aU of which fell on Monday.

This part-heard appeal from an order of Mr. Commis. eioner Goulbarn, opened on Mlonday last, was this morning resumed, The short facts of the case were that John Peter M'Morland Greig, cabinetmaker, of Bartlett's-buildings, fIolborn, was at the time of his bankruptcy a holder of 16 shares in the Royal British Bank. A proof was tendered against his estate by Mr. Harding, the official mnaer of the bank, for a sum of 1,2sOl., being the amount of the call of 751. per share made on the 10th of January last on the shares held by the bankrupt, who had been placed on the list of contributories. The Commissioner, onthe 2d of may last, rejectedthe proof on the ground thatthebankrupt had never been legally put upon the list of contributories. It appeared that the list, in the fist instanee, had been made out by Mr. Pugh, tho chief-clerk of Vice-Chancellor Kindersley, but afterwards signed by the Vice-Chancellor; and the Commissioner was of opinion that, under these circumstances, the list must be taken to have been settled by tho Chief-Clerk, a ministerial act he wag not competent' to do under the sttute appointing him (the 15th and 16th of Victoria, cap. 80). From this decision the official manager appealed. Upon the opening ofthe appeal theCoirt intimated their decided opinion to be that the orderof the Vicc-Chancel. lor could only be got rid of by a re-hearing before the Vice. ChanoeHor or by an appeal to this Court. At the same time an opportunity was given to the sdignes of Greig to move this Court in Chanoery to dilscharge the call upon its merits, under the usual risk of having to pay the costs if unsuccessfuL .This offer they declned, and therefore the appeal was placed in the paper to be disposed of. Mr. Bacon and Mr. W; D. Lewis a rearod for the official manager (the appellant) - Mr Daniel (Mr. Specd and Mr. Aspland with him) for the assignees of Greig, in support of the order of the Commissioner. A lengthened discussion ensued between the bench and the bar a: to the form in which the order of the ViceChanceUor under the Winding-up Act had been made, and after inspecting the books, it was admitted that the Chief Clerk had eventually followed the usual form of an order of this Court, beginning with the words "It is ordered," and The LoRD CHANCE!LLOR and Lord Justice Kmuoir B:ucE repeatedly pressed upox Mr. Daniel that the only way in which the assignees of Gre could be relieved from the call was by moving under the Im ing-up Acts to discha3ge the order of the Vice-ChaneeUor upon its merits At the same time it was a misapprehension to suppose this Court oould dismiss such application with eosts out of the bankrpt's estate, as the esate was in bankruptcy. Any question as to the payment of costs out of that estate must be raied before the Commissioner In the first place, and afterwards it might be brought here by way of appeaL.

VICHAlNOCLLORS' COTTRTq .Tr- 7 i THE NEWRY A .AY CO V. Sir J. STUA Rr This case wasresumed. In August, 1q49, the defendant, William Frederick Spackman, was elected a director of the Newry and Enniskillen Railway Company, and in January, 1850, he was elected chairman of the company, and thenceforth be acted as one of the directors and ohairman up to tho 9th of October, L'55, when he resigned both offices. The case alleged on behalf of the plaintiffs was, that during the years 153, 1854, and 1855, the defendlant received consdderable sums out of the funds of the company for the purpose of paying contractors, engineers, and others employed by the compauy, and that be applied such moneys to purposes different to those for which the same were entrusted to him, thereby committing a breach of trustthat he deducted out of moneys of the company entrusted to him to pay for rolling stock and plant and other things fmmuished to the company sums by way of bonus or commission, and thereby made large gains or profits; and that he also, out of the funds of the company, purchased for himself large numbers of the forfeited shares of the company and re-sold them at a large profit. The bill prayed for an account of the sums received and paid by the defendant out of thefunds of the company during the years 183, 1854, and 1855, and a like account of all sums reoeived by the defendant by way of bonus or commission, and a like account of the gains and profits made by the defendant by his alleged trafficking in the forfeited shares of the oompany, and that the defendant might be directed to pay the balance due from him to the plaintiffs. The accounts sought by the plaintiffs had, up to February, 1855, been submitted to the board of dircctors, duly audited, and passed by the shareholders at the general half-yearly meetings, but the accounts sought suebsequenttothatperiod had not been audited and passed by the shareholders. It appeared that the defendant had on several occasions between his appointment as chairman and the early part of L55 gone to Ireland on the business of the company, with the sanction of his colleagues in the direotion, andthat in the accoaunts which had been audited and passed by the shareholders he had been allowed out of the funds of the oompany payments for his time and trouble at the rate of 54 s. per day during his absence. Between Febrmary, 1855, and October, 1855, the defendant had been engaged for 70 days in Ireland on tho business of tho company, and he claimed an indemnity for the loss of his time an trouble at the rate of 3L 3s. per day during that period. The ground alleged for his claiming a lower rate of payment during the above 70 days than he had received when he was In Ireland on tho company's affairs prior to Febrnary, 1855, was that his timeduringthose70days was not fully occupied on the business of the company. The defendant altogether denied baving received any sum by way of bonus or commission on sums paid by him on account of the company, and he also denied having in any way trafficked in the forfeited shares of the company. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Speed appeared for the plaintiffs, and Mr. W. D. Lewis for the defendnut. The VICE-CHANCELLOR said that the bill contained charges of serious misconduct against the defendant, and as charges of that nature had been alleged they ought to have been proved. There was no evidence of the defendant baving employed one sixpence of thio money of the company iu buying forfeited shares, or that he had otherwise purchased in the market one of such shares. One question was whether a director of a company could purchase any shares which had been forfeited therein, and although it was not necessary to decide the question in this case, it seemed to him that the words of the company's Clauses Act empowering *' a ahareholder" to purchase such shares were so general that a director, who must necessarily be a shareholder, had the capacity to buy such shares. He thought that the case as to the forfeited shares and as to the charg esby way of commission or bonus had wholly failed, and the bi must, as to the arts relating to those two matters, be dismissed with costs. bere was nothing to justify the view that the accounts, which had been duly audited and passed by the shareholders, should be opened. There was no proof or even aUegation that the shareholders had not had an opportunity of investigating those accounts. If they had not done so, it was simply due to their own carelessness; and it would be impossible, without the greatest injustice, to open the accounts so audited and passed. With reference, however; to the accounts since February, 1855, a different principle applied, and these the plaintiffs should have an opportunty of canvassing. The bil would be dismimsed with costs, except so far as related to the accounts since February, 1855, and an account must be decreed of all receipts and payments by the defendants on accotmt of the company subeequent to Febrary, 1855; and in taking the accounts the defendant ia to have justi aowances inrespect of extraordinary ervices, losses, costs, and damages, having regard to the footing on which mch allowances were made in the previous aouants betwoen the defendant and the company. An inquiry must be made whether any and what sum was due to the defendant on tWing such accounts, and such amount would be certified. Further consideration of the queation relating to so much of the cost of the suit as were not now directed to be paid to the defendant would be adjournedL (Befo-e Vfc-Oh?ancor Sir W. P. WOOD.) THE BRITISE HeaR siPPIwG cowAN-Y (LImiTD) v. This case came on by way of demurrer to the bill, tho object of the snit being to obtain discovery from the defendants in aid of a oompulsory arbitration under an order of the Court of Queens oench. The plaintiffs are owners ef a ship caled the British Emp'ire, which had been under repair at the dooks of Messrs. SomeM, the defendants, who are ahipwrights atBlackwall. The account sent in by the defendants to the company for these repairs amounted, as alleged by the bill, to an excessive sum which, however, they had paid under protest in December last. In anuy they oommenced an action against the defendants for the recovery of the alleged excess, whereupon thedefendants obtained an order under the 3d seotion of the Common LAw Prooedure Act 185 for aoompulsor referencetoarbitration, which was now pending, aad the company filed the present bill for discovery a to matters relatig to certain alleged items of overcharge in the accounts sent in bythe defendants. Mr. lIOLT and Mr. SnA&Tmstupeared in support of the demurrer, and contende apins hes _ igh t of thempany to come to thig court for diacovery of matters and production of documents uin °ac oofthis description. The act expresyd provided by section 7 that these arbitrations were tobenco nucted in precisely the same way ag an arbitration by consnt, and, as to that kind of arbitration, therewas t'he express authority of Lord Eldon, in "1Street v. Rigby" (6 3esex 821) that this Court wouldI not be auxiliar to thesem domestie formns." Mffr. Dre was on the other side, but The VICCCHANOELLOIR, without call!ng upon him, held that the ecOpulsory arbitration under a Common TAW Ircocedure Act must be ta}en. to be the delegation by oa of the Qoeen's Courts to a.

The plaintiffs in this action were meroubt5 in London, who sued the defendants, M'Kellxr, who ws the owner of the ship Emperor, and Yourg, who was the master of the ship, to recoier damage4 for the conversion of a qutity of spelter At the trial which took place some timesince before Lord C mpeiO at Guldhall, it appeared that the oodsm inquestion had been purchased by the laintiffis for I=sss {,olEs Brothers; but, according to the counse of buEines between those parties, Coles was not to have the goods till he had paid for them. The defendant, 'KellUr, ad chartered a ship, the Emperor, to Van Noton and Co., for the voyagefromLondontoCalcutta,for a lump I Sum,and it was put up as a general ship. Coles enp ged freiglt for spelter on board the Emperor, and, according to thb e urse of business, the plaintiffs delivered the selterto a lighterman with instructions to bring back the mates receipt This was accordingly done, and the plantiffs retained the , mate' receipt for some time; but, on applying to the de- fendant M'Kellar for the bill of lading, they found that the broker bad already delivered a bill of Iading to Colas on the very day when the goods were put on board, but without requiring the production of the mate's receipt. The goods were taken to Calcutta, and were there delivered up to the Oriental Company, to whom Cole}had assigned the bill of lading a few days after he had received it. Under theme circumstances the plaintiffs obtained a verdict for the Talue of the spelter,-viz, 1,200L Subsequently a Tul was granted tor a new trial, upon the ground that the refdict wa against the evidenoe, and also to enter the verdict for the detendant, upon the ground that the action had been improperly brought against the owner and master, when it should have been brought, if at all, against tho charterers. ie question was argued a few days since by Mr. X. anlde, y C, and Mr. Colin Blackburn, for the plaintiffs; and r. Bov Q.C., and 3dr. Clasby, for tbe. defen The Court having taken time to consider, Lord CAPBELn now delivered judgment. The Court was of opinion that the verdict ought to stand for the plaintiff on the oDunt that the goo& had been unlawfuUy converted by the defendants. The Court was of opinion that the property in the spelter remained in the plaintiffs, and was never transferred to Coles. They(the plaintiffs) hd purcased the spelter of a merchant at Hamburg in their own name; and with their own money, and reoeived the biU of lading. and warehoused the goods in their own names in the port of London, and the intention was that it should remain their propert7 till they received the price from Cols. They ave the delvery order to a lighterman employeod by Coles, bet on the condition thet he should bring back the mat's receipt, which represented the spelter; and Coles well new that, til he had the myas receipt he had no property in the spelter, and that in obtaining it without the maste's re- ceipt he was committin an gross fraud. He thereby aquired the power of giving ariit 3a against the shipowner or charterer, to a bdfde assnee of the biU of ladinr.for value; but he acuquired no s{ht a against the plaintiffs, in whomithe proerty was stilevested the property remained In the plain when the spelter was stored at Calcutta contrary to their orders, and when it was delivered to the Oriental Company as assignees of the bil of lading. The Court had then to ivquire whether the plaintffs haddone or omitted anything which prevented them from recovering. It was a question for the jury whether, according to the usages of the trade and the circumstnces proved, thenamaWs was justified in aiving the bill of lading to Coles without takingthe matesrceipt inexehangel Thejumry found that qeation in favour of Ith plaint and the Court thought the verdict was asatisf*toryo wes admitt tht i the master and brokers bad known that there was a mate's receipt it would have been their duty to require its Production, and to have it attached toithe b of lading; ut the inowledge of it might have been wol presumed, and there was no evidence to negative it So long as the document remained In the plaintiffs' possesson they had ever reson to believe that thiey were secuLre, and they ought not to he prejudiced by the subsequent delay which had taken place in making the demand on the defendants. There was no ground for the suggestion which had been made that the plaintiffs bad given credit to Coles for the spelter. The Court had, therefore, only to consider whether the action brd been brought against theproper partie. So far as Yu, the omaste, was concern thr was no doubt, for he had signed the bill of lading in order that the spelter should be delivered to Coler, and, after demand, he had delivered the spelter to Coled order at Calcutta. There was more difficulty with respect to the shipowner, M'KetVNt, and if the demand had been made upon him by any one claiming under a bill of lading, signed by the mnaster, the Court would have been stron in. lined to hold that he was not liable. The ship boon chartered by the Bhipowner to Van Notbon and Co. for the vowage from london to Calcutta for a lump sum of t,8001., evidently to be put up by the charterers as a general ship, with a stipulation as to the maser signing bwls of laing for the benegite of the charterers, The master aud crew were paid by the owner, so that this was not ademis of the shJp locatio uavi.s, but a locatio nauns dci eras-um magietri et vauticoh m a contract for the carria-ge of the merchant's goods in the owner's ship and by his servant, where the owner had all the responsibility of the oarrier of the goods. In such a cae it hyA been held that the owner had a lien for freight on the goods in his posdsion, and was lable for tho acts or neglience of the maste as master, irrepective of the contracts entered into by the master as agent to the charterer. Here the plaintiwfit could not sue the charterers for the conversion of the p vter, for it was not done for their benefit nor authorized by them.

This was an action to recover the sum of 2331. 14s. for sewers-rates1 and came on to be tried at Gaildford at the last summer assizes, when a verdict was taken for the plaintifis subject to the opinion of this Court on a special cae. The questions raised were-first, whether the Vauxball-bridge Company derived any special benefit from the sewers, such as conferred jurisdiction on the Commissioners of Sewers to rate that company in respect of this bridge and other property; and, secondly, whether, assuming that they do not aerive any such benefit, the 95th and 96th sections of the Metropolitan Sewors Act made the decision of the Commissioners, if unappealed against within a month, final and conclusive, even although a person so rated and not appealingmay be rated in respect of property which is by law entitled to exemption. The COURT took time to consider. BAIL COURT. (Staings at Nisi Prium, bCfore JMr. Justice WIGxIxTw.) POWER AND PILGRDM V. BURCHNALL. Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Merewether were counsel for the plaintiffs, and rx. Seijeant Ballantine for the defendant. The plaintiffs were attorneys in Warwickshire, and they brought their action against the defendant, a farmer in that county, for 191. tho balance of a bill of costs. It appeared that in May, 1854, the defendant had some dispute about tho payment of a church-rate, and he determined to indict somo parties for perjury, and instmrcted the plaintiffs to adopt proceedings. The defendant also gave them instructions as to appealing against the rate, and he desired them to take the opinion of counsel as to appealing or indicting the parties. The plaintiffs prepared a case, and sent it to counsel in London for an opinon. The case was returned with an opinion on it to the plaintiffs and it was aftervr sent back for a further opinion. To occupied so much time that the period for giving notice of appeal had expired. The appeal, however, was entered and respited according to the opinion of counsel and by the instructions of BurchnalL Some timeafterwards Burchnall gave the plaintiffs authority to settle the matter. In November, 1854, the plaintiffs sent in their bill of costs, and on the 7th of the next month Burchnallpaid 151. on acconnt. Several letters were written to Burchnallfor payment of the balance, but as he did not pay the action was brought. The defence was thattheplaintffs did not act with due diligence, but had been guilty of negligence. The only question was whether Burchnall had given the plaintiffs unlimited instructions to prosecute the appeal on the 7th Of June. The plaintiff Pilgrim swore that the instructions were not given on that day to appeal, but merely to take the opinion of counsel on the matter. On the part of the defendant It was urged that the plaintifts, knowing that the quarter sessions were on the 26th of June, eught to have given notice of appeal before they sent up the case to oounseL becau they ought to hxve known that by the day they oould get the opinion back the time for giving notioe of appelwouldhave expired. Upon this it was contended that there had been negligence, and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the cosb of the case and opini-on, and of entering and respiting the appeal. These costs it was said amounted to more than the sum claimed. The defendantpaid 31. ls.o5d. into Cour. The defendant was called, and stated that he told the plaintiffs on the first interview to take the matter to theo aesionLs, and that Mr. Pilgrira told him that there was plenty of time. On cross-examination the defendant said that he denied that he had signed the rate. The hook was afterwards produted and his signature appeared to it, but he would swesr thatoe was not at the meeting on that particular day, and he had determined to indict the parties who had sworh he was there, OneoOf those gentlemen was a farmer of Mige property and. farmed his on estate, Mr. Power, the plantiff had advised hin to compromlise and not te go to expense. ear.

This was an action brdught to recover damages for certain injuries done to the plaintiff by the alleged negligent driving of the servant of the defendant.

This case, which was an action for slander, was also settled after Mr. Serjeant Shee's opening, and before the witnesses were called; and all the other causes in the list oxce g one, having been either arranged or struck out thselat case was called on and disposed of. PARN V. BATCIIELOR. Mr. BrandIt appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. O'haUey, Q.C., and Mr. Keane were for the defendant. The plaintiff keeps a coffee-shop in Somers-town, and the defendant is a costermonger and cats'-meat seUer, carrying on business in the same neighbourhood, and this action was brought to recover damages for certain slanderous words aleged to have been used by the defendant respecting the plaintiff. It appeared that for some two years back the defendant, who had conceived a dislike to the plaintiff, bad frequently and in public accused him of seeling poisoned coffee, of bdng a thief and a swindler, and of a crime of a beastly nature, which he alleged that Mr. Pain had committed habe tually with a Mr. S-. On Sunday, the 9th of November last, the defendant went to the plaintiff's house, and in the presence of Pain and some of his customers reiterated aU the accasations which he had been in the habit of making to others. polceman was sent for and he eventuaUy left. On the lith mr. Pain issued his writ. Since the action was commenced the plaintiff's business has gone down, and his friends have looked shilv on him; but, as these circum. stances occurred after the flth, it was ruled by the learned judge that they could not influence the jury in assessing damages, Mr. Brandt urging that what took place after words were uttered was evdence of the tendency of those words. Mr. KEANz, who addres3ed the jury for the defence, said that the defendant's language was not calculated to damage so respectable a man as the plaintiff appeaTed to be, that it was mere vulgar abuse, and as such to be despised. He then called the defendant and some other witnesses, who said that Pain had accused Batchelor of being " a fence," and that Batchelor used no bad language to Pain, but merely sad, "Your father had 18 months, your brother cut his throat, and if you have rope enough you'll hang yourEelf." Mr. O'MALLLY, in summing up to the jury, again said that the abuse of a foul-mouthed costermonger would not hurt the character of a man like Pain. MIr. Ba.tayr, in reply, said that if a man indulged in the luxur'- of bad language he must pay for it, and not shelter himself under the cloak of a blackguard, especially when he brought such serious charges against a man as that of having been guilty of the moat disgusting crime which could Mr. Justice CROWDER was about to sum up, when The Foreman of the Jury said that they were all agreed mpon their verdict.

COURT OF EXCHEQUER. TDnRDAV. .T-'s 9 EX PARTE BARFR-TARMA Q (Sittings in Banco.) Tho prisoner having been brought up yesterday in custody by the gaoler of Stafford, to whom the writ of hub=o corpws was directed, as mentioned when the motion was made on Friday, Mr. ScOTLND, with whom was yr. Wheeler, objected to the sufriciency of the conviction under which the prisoner's detention was justified on several grounds. The first objection was founded on affidavits showing that the prisoner having contracted for a year with his maeter and entered into his service, unlawfully absented himself there. from, after some dispute had arisen as to his wages, where. upon he was summoned before a justice of the peace, convicted, and sent to prison for a month for "absenting himself" from his service without notice or leave or sufficientreason. At the expiration of the term of imprisonment so inflicted, the prisoner hired himnself to another astser, and on being applied to refused to return to his formor service. His first master then took out another gm mons against him for "1 absenting himself," and the prisoner was again convicted and sentenced to a second month's isprisonment. On this state of facts it was insisted that the justice had no jurisdiction to convict the prisoner on the second summons, as the statute of the 4th George IV., cap. 34, sec. 3, under which the conviction must have proceeded, though it did not so allege, did not contemplate more than one offence and one punishment, which might exteind as far as three months, for a servant absenting himself from a service into which he had once entered. The affidavit showed that, at all events, there had only been one continuig absence, for the prisoner had not returned after the first term of imprisonment had expired, and had originanly quitted the service avowedly without the intention of returning to it. The justice had only jurisdiction to punish once fo: all, and this must be taken tc have been either a conviction for not returning, which is not within the Act, or a second conviction for one and the same offence of absenting, and either way the prisoner would be eititled to his discharge. For all civil purposes it may be that the contract exsts after one conviction, but certainly for criminal purposes it is put an end to by the conviction. It was also objected that the conviction was bad on the face of it on two grounds-first, because it did not find as a fact that the prisoner had entered on the service. Though It recited a complaint to that effect, the adjudication omits that fact; and, secondly, because the justice, being bound to hear evidence only in the presence of the prisoner, the conviction sets forth that the adjudication proceeded on evidence taken in his presence " and other,wise," from wvhich it could only be inferred that something had taken plaeo behind the back of the prisoner. Mr. HUDDLEESTON; appeared in support of the conviction yesterday and to-day, and argued that, though it was competent to adduce affidavits to show that there was no jurisdiction in the justice at all, yet it was not open to the applicant to use affidavits to show that he had been iniproperly convicted. As to the main question,he contended that the contract was a continuing one, over which the justice had jurisdiction as often as the servant committed the offenoe of absenting himself, and where, as here, he had been requested to return after the first conviction, and had expressly refused, such refusal was a fresh " absernting himself," for which he might agin be punished. If this were not so, the statute would become a dead letter, and, instead of being a protection to masterd and a means of enforcing servants to adhere to their civil contracts by a less expensive process than an action, which would be utterly fruitless, it would become a means whereby servants could always evade and break their contracts, for they would in all cases put an end to their engagement by absenting themselves andurlagthepunihment, after which they would snay their fingers at their moasters. The CHern BARON, at the sitting of the Court to-day, referred totheprior statuteonthe samesubject. 6th GeorgelIL, cap. 25, where the Legislature introduced the words "1from time to time" when giving power to justices to punish apprentices, hut omnits them when dealiug with workmen and servants, as this Act did also. Mr. HIUDDLMSTON repeated that, nevertheless, the proper construction of the present statute was that which the Court of Queen's Bench had in this very case put upon it and which he ventured to contend for. The 3d sectfon, no doubt, gave power to punish once for all in those cases where, there being a written contract, the servant had refused to enter on it at all, for there could be only one offence there; but after the service had been entered upon the servant was bound to go on to its end, and he might be punished by imprisonment and abatement of wages as often as ho misconducted himself or negleeted his work, or absented himself, and if the justice thought proper he might dissolve thecontract,-a power which showed that the Legislature did not contemplate the construction now contended for-namely, that a conviction for absenting himself would operate as a termination of the contract. The learned counsel having addressed himself to the other and more technical objections, The COURT retired to consider its judgment. Aftr an interval of half an hour it reassembled, when The CHEF BARON stated that it was desirable that one Moint should be more fully discussed, which had only as vet been glanced at, and that was one which arose on an objecio ttthiseonuvictionoght to have adjudicated on the acctjon giving power to do bo°th, tnhot ei thenr he omneo the hof George IV., chap. 34, at all, on which this questio iaeuld Arnse. It Might have taken placewur4r the Oti of George IL, cap. 26, which would be free from the ques. then it would be clearly nod. But he eeried thit the Act of the 4th of George IV. was cumn. iative, and contended that it was competent'to the justice to award imprisonment alone, for non cStat tha' any wages would be dae at al. Mr. SCOTLA.ND, in reply, insisted that the conviction must be taken to have been under one or other of the atatutes-it could not be under both, and must he taken as it had been hitherto assumed throughout a long argument,' to have taken place under the 4th of George It., cap 34. In constTuing that statute the Court could not fail to observe that it was an enactment contrary to the spirit of our laws, and ought therefore to be construed most strictly, for nothing was to be intended in favour of a conviction which dealt with a man's liberty. The COUBT having again retired, but for a very brief pe'riod, Mr. Baron WATSON on its return proceeded to deliver his judgment, there being a difference of opinion between him. selt and the rest of the Court. This he regretted, and he gave hisjudgment to the ef'ect that the conviction was good with great diffidence. As, however, be wAs bound to lo his duty acoording to the best-of his abilty, he felt coaitrained to deliver his opinion. As to the objection to the. reception of affidavits, he thought they might be used, and as to the statute, he did not think it was competent to the Court to inquire into the wisdom of the legislature, but to give effect to the laws enacted by them. In his opinion, the contract remained if the justice did not dissolve it, and the refusal to return after the first conviction and imprisonment was a fresh absenting, for which the servant could be punished. Eis Lordship then discussed the two technical objections taken atthe bar, both of which he overruled; and as to that which had been started late in the case, he was of opinion that it was competent to the justice to decide on imprison. ment without entering on the question of wagesunder the 4th of George IV., and if be could not the auswer given by Mr. Huddleston was good,-namely, that the conviction might be supported under the earlier statute of the 6th of George IIL, cap. 25. The! eonvicMon was therefore, in his opinon, geooa. Wr. Baron BsAsWuuLLwas of opinion that the conviction was bad, and that the prisoner was eatitled to hi, discharge. The inclination of his mind was that the Court could not receive affidavits, but, assuming that to be so, he thought there might be a fresh absenting and conviction after the first, for the absence was not a continuing one. The justice therefore had jurisdiction if we can look into the affidavits. The two other objections taken by Mr. Scotland were not good. The conviction did adjudicate with sufficient certainty in the fact that the service had been entered ; and it did not appear to him that the word " other. ise" ought to be taken to mean evidence other than that taken in the prisoner's presence. There was a ground of objection, however, which he did think fatal, and that was the omission to adjudicate on the question of wages, which the Act required the magistrate to do as well as upon the question of imprisonment. The prisoner could not complain that he had not been punisbed enough; but he might complain that all the differences between his master and himself had not been decided as they oueht to have been, The conviction was therefore bad; nor, in his opinion. could the justie faU back upon the statute 6th George III., cap. 21.1 Mr. Baron MAMTrv was also of opinion, and for the same reasons assigned by Mr. Baron Bramwell, that the prisoner was entitled to hi dicharge. The 3d section of the Act gave power to the justice, and required him, to imprison and adjudicate on the wages also at one and the same tlme, which was an important a'nd essential addition to the jurisdiction created by the 6th of George III., cap. 25. Nor could the conviction be supported under that statute. That statute gave an appeal, which was taken away by the 4th of George IV., cap. 34. Surely it was not competent to justices to frame convictions so that it was difficult to say under which statute they had acted. If convictions were left uncertain and amnbiguous, they were bad. As to the main question of the construction to be put on the3d seotionwith reference to the offence of absenting himself, he thought it was so nice and difficult that he would not pronounce any positive opinion upon it. If Mr. Huddleston were right, a man might be convicted over and over again during aU the period over which his contracts extended, without appeal; but his impression was that the nature of the offence must be looked at; and if it appeared'hat a servant quitted servioe once for all avowedly, that was one offence only, and he could only be punished once for all, and sent to prison for not more than three months. If his absence was only for a time, then It might be that he might be punished on each occasion. It was clear that in any civil question which might arise as to the breach of his contract between his master and himself, whoever sued could only recover damages once for all for the breach. But how that might be in criminal matters he could not say - bnt he bad the satisfaction of knowing that it was in con. templation to introduce a measure into Parliament which would remedy the defects of the present state of tho law. The CHIEF BARON was also of opinion that the prisoner must be discharged, as he agreed with the majority of the Court that this conviction was bad, on the ground that it did not adjudicate on the question of the wages, as required by the statute of the 4th of George IV., ca 34, under which alone it must be supported, if at all. The question of wages may be of the utmost importance, and I think the statute of 6th George IIL cannot bereferred toin support ofthis defective adjudication. If the convictionwere under that, there was an end at once of all doubt, as that Act when dealing with apprentices did give a toties quotieg jurisdition to the justices, which it did not give, andl might well withhold, in the case of grown men with wives and children dependant upon them. It is to be inferred that where the ature means to give such powers it sys so; and when it does not mean so it does not sa 80. Bat it was said that the context of the statute 4th George IV. shows that the Legislature there contemplated a continuing contract after one offence and conviction, and reference is made to the third mode of dealing with servants-namely, the power of dissolving the contract. That, however, was farfrom showving that where the justice does not discharge the parties fromtheir contract it must be taken to subsist. If it did, then it might happen that repeated cOnvictions might be enforced against a man in respect of a year's contract, which would entail on him imprisonment for nearly 15 months. It appeared to him most clearly that the Legisature did mean expresslyto limit the powor of punishment to a period of three months, and to create only one offence of absenting himself, after which the contract should be treated as at an end. He was glad to hear that an Act such as had been alluded to was about to be introduced on this subject, and he thus expreseed himself in order that the Court of Queen's Bench having expressed a different view of this statute, the attention of the Leislature mi ht be drawn to it. If this Iwere a civil question, there could be but one breach and one action for damages, and he could not see why the same principle should not govern the administration of the criminal law, the treadmill being, in his opinion, about as bad and inconvenient an instrument as could wvell be resorted to as a means of enforcing labour from week to week from human beings. For these reasons he thought it right to declare his opimnon openly and clearly on this branch of the subject, which greatly affected the rights and liabilities of the labouring elasses, and to adjudge that the prisoner should be discharged. His LORDSHIP then, addressing the applicant, said, " You They''gaolerhthenasetir atlibertyhePriso°ner, who reverentialy "ulld hs hir"to he hie Baon,in token of his ppreciation of his Lordship's courtesy and judgment, and qatted the court a free man, and capable of enjoying the ~rest of Whit Tuesday.

The defendant pleaded never indebted and payment. Mr. dwin James and Mr. Powell were counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. Joyce represented the defendants. It appeared from the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff that he had been employed by the defendant to procure a loan of 1,0001. to be secured upon the Russel Hotel, in the Brixton-road. The plaintiff was to have a sum of 501. for his services, and, having found a person willng toadvance the amount, he waspaid 201. by the defendant on account. As he had been unable to obtain the balance he had brought the present action. The defence was that there was no such bargain between the parties, and that the charge made by the plaintiff was excessve. His LORDSEPr, in summing up, told the jury that the chief question for them wouli be, was there a bargain betwveen the parties that the defendant should pay the Plaintiff 501. for his services. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount claimed.
COUBT OF BA NXRUPTCY, Baei7nghaaZl8rete4 June 2. :[N RE TRHOAA RYnVR. A RA %1R~ I (Before Mr. Commis3ioner HOLROYD.) Mr. Commissioner HOLROYD.-In this ease the bankrapt, an Bast India merchant, of Old fBroad-street, applies to the Court for his certificato. Hlis balance-sheet commences on the 1st of January, 1854, but he had been in business for some ten years or more previously, and in 1851 he comu pounded with hisa reditors, paying only 2s. in the pound. Then in 1854 he started as an East India merchant, but looking to his then position and to the nature of his subsequent dealugs, I should rather cal him an adventurer. At thbi time-namely, on the lst of January, 1854-he owed 1,1711., 8251. of which he describes in his balance-sheet as book dobts (which he owed as far back as the 1st of July, 1852), and 3461. as the balanee at debit of expense account on the 31st of December, 1853; and his then assets were 45. in cash, 491. in blUs, and 221. in office furniture. On the 30th of January, 1856, 'he bankrupt petitioned the Court under the arrangement clauses, and on the 8th of April following (his proposal not being deemed reasonable) he was adjudged bankrupt. The general features of the case to be collected from the baiance-sheet exhibit a short, but most unjustifiable course of trading. He now owes to unsecured creditors 17,1211.; and his liabilities on biUs, on a guarantee, and on charters of vessels, are 11,3541. more. Then tho creditors for advancea to the bankrupt on goods shipped and consigned through them stand on the balancesheet at 34,5161., and the amount of consignments as there stated is 41,2452., glviag an estimated surplus of 6,8521.; but the offiCal asignee bas made and adjusted with the bankrupt a tabular statement, and the regalt as there shown is that the official agnee has received to the present timse 1,3291. ln respect of surplus on consignments, and that 50Og will cover any further surplus expected to come to the edate. The gross profits, as saXted in the balancesheet, are 4,0822., of which snm 1,794. is on commission account, and only 4031. on conudgnmenta where account sales are aleed, wdl9U O3 a ar,o pzopfit on Ales not cloed. Thenthelosses of thebankmrpt, as stated inhisbalance-sheet, ar,enmtto 9,9012., of whichthesnm offi,8764arisesonconsign. ments, and the rest is made up of losses on sundry ventures, bad and doubtful debts, law charges, Consols and shares, &e., and interest. The loss on consignments will, in fact, amount to abont 12,0001., having been increased by 5,0001., the amount of the falling short of the estimated surplus on consigaments. The expenses of the bankrupt in his trade seem moderate-7351,; but, having regard to his circumstances, I cannot say the same of his domestic and personal expenses, which for the two years and one month are 2,1721., or about 9501. a-year. The total sum proved and proveable against the estate is 17,7521., of which 10,7341. has been already proved, and this is irrespective of his liabilities on charters, amounting to 9,0004; and to meet the large demands against him the assets, or; I should rather say., the salvage of the wreck of some of the goods of his creditors, will not exceed 2,200! 2e., therefore, in the pound is the outside of any-expected dividend. The grounds of opposition relied upon by Mr. Lawrance (solicitorfor the asslgnees)i are :-i tradinK reok Itsly; 2, obtaining goods of Warner (the assignee) by a false representatidn as to bis circumstances, and under a promise to pay ready money or prompt for them and not seepinghispromise (Warner being nowa creditor for 2,845!., of which amounrt the sum of 2,300!. was for the price of those goods); 3, loses by the bankrupt during bis trading of more than 201. in one day by gaming or wagering. Now, the course of business pursncd by the bankrupt was this:As soon as he bought goods he got advances upon them, averaging about 70!. per cent., and the -eods were then shipned to different parts of the wor'd, through the pa:hes who made advances upon them. First it is to be observed that the bankrupt must have satisfied the debts which he owed on the 1st of January, 1854, out of advances made to him on oods which he bough' on oredit, and that by the aid of sucTh advances he from time to time paid for previous purchases and made some purchases for ready money, and by a course of similar dealings-for the system was continuous throughout his trading-he contrived for a time to be apparently making his payments in ' e course; but, as he had admitted in his exammation, he was always insolvent, and getting from bad to worse; so that, after two years and one month's tradipg, in the first year his purchases amounting to 10,0001. and in the following 13 months to 47,0004-together, therefore, involving about 67,0001.-his losses on shipments stopped his desperate career. Now, the bankrupt was not an inexpenenced trader; be had been in business for many years and had acquired a knowledge of trade; he was at one time a clerk in Baring's house, and his hooks were well kept. Still, though piossessing qualities sO desirable and essential to success, these became valueless to him for the want of that one more essential quality-ordinary commercial prudence. Thus he was led to indulge in hopes beyond the warrant of all reason, and to engage in traniactions to such an extent during his insolvency as to constitute a case of reckless trading. The only excuse that can be attempted for the bankupt is the great facility with which persons in this country obtain advances on goods; but is this a legitimate excuse? Is the vendor of goods to be the only sufferer? Must not rather the trader who, without due caution and beyond reasonable bounds, takes advantage of; this facility dosoathisperil? It appears to me that the system of obtaming advances on goods, however usual it may be with traders, is, unless exercised with great clrcurospection, most mischievous, and calls loudly for the eevere reprehension of this Court. With rising markets such a system may go on for a time, as a trader may then find it easy to raise money upon his purchases, and so sustain his credit for a while, and have the semblanoe of being well to do in the world; but as soon as a reverse comes-that is, when markets fall-. the trader whohas too readily given way to such a conrse of speculation, if he haa no capital to fall back upon to meet losses, must soon sik, and with'httle or nothing for his unsecured creditors. In plain English, as between him and his creditors, "- Heads I win, tails you lose," truly depicts the system. Mxr. Lnklater, in his zeal for his chent deseribed the bankrupt's course as a legitimate struggle to maintain his position. It appears to me that it was a course directly opposed to every principle of commercial rectitude. Is it consistent wAth common honesty for a man who lite. rally has nothing, to tradeunpon credit at all and, if at all, wvithin what limitsl Surely the amounst of credit wihich a trader thinks fit to take should hear some relative proportion to the amount of his capital. I believe all the judges of this Court will concur in some observations made by the Lord Chief Baron in the case of " Biddle v. Thompson," reported in some of the daily journals of July 7th, 18 Itwas an action for a libeL The defendant was the pro. prietor f the Le*cster CO?ronicde, and in an article in that paper had commented in severe terms upon the discreditable circeustances under which the plaintiff had become bankrupt. The question was whether the article had gone beyond the fair limits of discussion. In the course of his summing-up the Lord Chief Baron Pollock is reported to have said that the moet prolific source of misery in this country arose from persons trading beyond their capital and living beyond their means. No man was justifiedin carrying on his business for a single day beyond the time he was able to meet his labilities. His Lordshin considered trading in insolvent circumstances highly dislionest, The too ready allowance of certificates to traders who continue carrying on business after they must or should know that they are insolvent is, in my opinion, likely to produce incalculable mischief, and to operate as a premium to improvidence and fraud. Then, as to the second objection, Mr. Warner was examined, and he said that on the 7th of December, 1855, in consequence of a communication from the bnkrupt, who was then indebted to him in a consider. able sum, he had an interview with him relative to his account. " He told me he was anxious for more goods of a different description, and would be glad if I would undertake to make purchases for him; that he would pay part in cash and part in bills, and he gave me references. Some prompts were then overdue. I inquired of the bankrupt the state of his affairs. I required to know the exact positioin of his affairs before I entered upon other transactions. I said to him, 'Are you a solvent man?' He said, ' I am, and a prosperous man.' Hlis reason for wishing to increase his business was that he had made arrangements with friends to advance money on goods, and that he shonld do a large business." After this conversation-namely, on the 8th and 13th of December, Warner let the bankrupt have three parcels of goods-amounting in value to 2,3001., upon his promise to pay for them in cash or 14 days prompt. It seems that the bankrupt paid Mr. Warner 6611. lOs. on the 8th of December, and on the 15th of December two sums amountin to 1,5001., these payments being for goods previously supplied, but he did not pay the 2,3001. which, according to his promise, he ought to have paid in 14 days prompt from the 8th and 13th of December, and his excuse is (to use his own words)that credits did not come forward as he expected, thong be says that he has no doubt the goods which he bought of warner on the 8th and 13th of December were shi ped by him,ad that he got an advance upon them. He baI two other parcels of goods from Warner on the 2d of January, 1856, but Warner would not part with these goods without having cash for them at the time. Subsequently Warner, not having been able to get his money, and having in va in tried to get some security from the bankrupt, did the best he could for himself, and on the 4th of JAanTuary rtook three months' billis for the sum owing to him, putting a credit profit on those goods which ought to have been paid for prompt. The bankru t contdicts Warner, and says that he never represented himself to be a solvent and a prosperous man. The bankrupt's story is that Warner said to him he must either be a man of considerable means or a very clever man, to which he (the bankrept) answered that he mmutbothelatter, as he would never trade underfalse colours. The bankrupt, however, admits that he had the goods on the 8th and 13th of December under a promise to pay cash or prompt in 14 days ; and by the invoices 2i per cent. disconnt for cash is allowed. Now, I think the payments which were made by the bankrupt to Warner on the 8th and 15th of December, to which I have before referred, relieve the bankrupt from the charge of studied deceit against Warner in the purchases for cash contracted for on the 8th and 13th of December; but I do not think the bankrupt clearsi himself from the imputation of an intention to impose upon Warner as to his (the bankrapfs) circumstances, for whether or not he represented himsf to be a solvent man in so many words is immaterial. The obtaining goods under a promise to pay cash or prompt, coupled, moreover, with an assurance by the bankrupt that he would never trade under false colours, amounts, I think, to a representation of solvency, and a fter such a promise Warner xn as fully u-twied in considering tht the bankr rupt was a solvent man, and one cannot suppose that Warner would have parted with his goods unless he had so believed and I think the hankrupt mu have felt that the result of the conversation between Warner and himself wbas substantialy a misrepresentation of facts by the bankrupt and a concealment of the truth. The extent of Warner's deaings wpithi the bankrupt w s aboubt 9,0001. Warner knew that the bankrupt shipped goods to allparts of the world, and tLat he got advances upon goods soeshipped; andrthis course of business by a solvent man and within proper hounds might not be objectionable. I see no reason, therefore, for onfoWrher with any want of care or caution in dealing with the bankrupt upon the faith of the representation and promise made by the latter. Then the bar; pt laid some stress on sbi losses by chartering vessels. He says that on the 17th or 18th of January, 1-856, there was a telegraphic message as to the expected peace; the rate of freights conseq,uently fell, and hence (bcesays) his failure. The change mn the state of public affairs may have had some effect on the bankrupt's position, and was probably the rason for his selectingthat opportunity of petitioning for aprivatearruge. ment with his creditors, but his failure is not to be attributed to losses on chartering vessels, He states in his petition for arrangement that his inability to meet his enesee_ents arisegfromlosses on shipdments on goods to ba York, India, Rio de Janeiro, and breach of cOntract bysa erson with whom the bankrupt did business; and in an aidavit which he made under that petition, and sworn on the 2-5th of February, 1856, the bankrupt says that he shall be unable to state the result in profit or loss arising from the charters for the next three months, nearly all the vessels having only reently left England on their outward voyage, He had chartered 2a vessels, 22 of which were to carry grain from New York to England and the continent. It does not appear that he had paid any money upon any of these charters, The true cause of the bankrupt's failure as a merchant was his insolvency from the om- meniement of his trading, and, so far as the expectation of peace may have hsd an effect upon his dealings in general, at only proves what I have already stated as to the probable, if not inevitable, oon nence of mereantile speculations by insolvent traders. then, as to the third objection :-In 1854 the bankrnat lost 140!. by time baramns in Consols; aad in 1855 851. 17s. Gd. by like dealings in Turkish Scrip. This raises a question upon the construc- tion to be put upon the first branch of the 201st section of the Bankrupt lAw Consolidation Act, 1849. By that section it is enacted that no bakrupt shall be entitled to a oertificate of conformity if he shall have lost by any sort of gaming or wagering in one day 20!. or witbin one year next precedig the filing of the petition for adjudication *f 20P7.; or if be shall witbith one year next preeding the fiing of such petition have lost 200& by any ontractifor the purchase or sale of any Government or other sto¢k where such cont ws not So be performed within one week after tho contract, or where the stock bou or sold was not Actualy trnslferred or deliverd in pursuianceoffsuch contract. Now,'with reference to the construiction to boput uponkthat section, Loord JsticeKnight Bruce (in "1Ex parte Matheson," 1 De Gex, Mi. and G., 450, antd 1 Bankcruptcy Appeals, 51) says, that whether the 201st section be a penal. section or not, the words must be interpretedl acorin to the rule a.pplicable to the constrution of all statuties"rom the earliest time-.that is to suppres the roischief and advance the remedv. It appears to me that accordling to the fair and obvious meanin3g of the -words employedl to expreess the intention .of the Legislature the -words "gaming or wagering, in the first branch of the 201st section, must apply to all gaming or wagering, and whether at lawful or unlawful games. The Act conxtains no expression to confine the terms "gaming or wagering" to gamin or wagering i'n anypriurkndo games mie th oIder Acts iwhich the different dmecriptions of gaming are specife,TeLgislature has adopted the same words inL the first branch of the 20lst section of the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act, 1849, as are used in the 8th and 9th of 'Victoria, cap. 109, sect. 8 by which "1all contracts by, 'way of gamin or wagering shall be null and void." But it was contendied that the circumtstance of some particular dealings ion,e funds.being menitionedaintheoaeconfibrancbh. of the 201st section 'would exclude from the first branch of that section any dealings in 'the funds, though amounting to gamiLng or wagering within the meaning of the 8th and 9th of Victoria, cap. 109, sect. 18, or though coming within the ordinary acceptatlon of those terms. But I do not concur with that construction. I think, the intention of the Lelature, by the words in the second branch of th 201st section, 'wa to include dealig which might not amount to "gaming or wagering," and not to exclude from the first branch of that section dealings 'which come within the fair aLnd obviousimeaning of the termi "gaming or wagering," the effect of which would be to give a different meaning to the term "gaming or wagering," as used in the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act, from 'what the same words bear sas used in the 8th and 9th of Victoria, cap. 109, sec 18. See "Parsons's', Alexander" EL. and B , 269; "1Grizebrook v. Blane," 11 C. B., 53; "'Nicholson v. Gooch,' 5 EL and Bl., 1,013; and see lordl Crenwortbh in "Eix parte Copeland," 1 Bankruptcy Appeals, 208. I think there is nothing in the 201st section fromn which it can be collected that the intention of the legislature 'was that the particular words in the second branch of the section ishould control the general words; in the first branch, and it bas been held that if in t'he same Act of Parliament there be one clause which applies to a particular- case and another which is conceived in general terms the former shall not restrain the signification of the latter, at least where the intention of the tr Is not apparent to that purpse(see " Andrle v.UfleVtc1h3ear,"6 2 T. IL, 164, anda "ilas v. Pritchard," 4 T. R., 3). Now, here it appears to me that t'he intention of the Legislature was the other way, TXhe second branch of the 201st section 'was necessary for tho purpose of taking in losse on contracts, which the Legislature thought fit to prohibit, though not amounting to gaming or wagering, or losss on oth.er contracts which, though amounting to gaming or waerlng, didanot involve a loss of 201. in one day. A bosdjfd econtract for the purchase or Wae of stock, where not to be performed withini one 'week after the contract, would not pei- se be gaming or 'wagering even if the p,rty had not the stock at the time. (See "1MortievM allau,' 6 1, and W., 58 70; 7 m. anai w., 90 9M. and W., 636 ; and "Nicholson v. Good" (5 El. aABL, 1,013.) But such a contract would comne 'within the seond branch of the 201st setion. Again, a bonidfide contract for the jpurchase or sale of stock might terminate in the stock not being actuallytransferredaor deiivered. This, uinder the second branch of the 201st section (a loss havin been thereby incured in manner therein mentioned), would disentitle the trader to his certificate ; hut still this would not be gataing or wagering unless at the time of the contract there was no 2ntention on either side that stock should be delivered, and unles the intention was that the contract was to be settled by the payment of differences. Again, a, loss by time bargains in the funds if net to the extent of 201. in one dlay, though to mnore thau the amount of 2001. 'within one year next prweedig the faiig of the petition for adjudication, 'would not be affected b the first branch of the 01s setio. Ten t ws sidtat in this case there 'was no petition for adjudication of bankruptcy, the adjudicationx having been miade under a petition for private arrangement. This, however, 'wil be immaterial, if the transactions of the bankrupt come withinL the first branch of the 201st section, which applies to gaming or wagering of 201, in one day At any time during t e trading. Then, what was the ntature of the bankrupt's dealings in Consols ? In the year 1854 he had five transactions in Consols, upon which there, resulted a loss of 1401., being the difference bet'ween6,592 10s., the amountof his pretended parchaseswith the commxsson, and 6,452410alO. the amiount of his pretended saes, and on one of thos transactions there was a less Of mnore than 201, in one day, for in May and June of that year he made (in form) three several contracts, each for the sale of 1,0001, Consuls for the July account; and on the 19th of June (in like form) he contracted to purchase 3,0001 Consols for the aceount, and upon this transaction, there accrued to the bankrupt aloss of 1151. Now, these contracts, like the contrats described by Lord Cam-el,in I,Nicholson v. Goo,ch," 5 EL. and BL, 1,012, had y the broker's note the form of legal contracts for the sale and transfer of stock; but according to the evidence of the bankrupt and of his books they were mere wag~ers on the price of stock on the account day compared 'wit the price on the day of the supposed sale, The seller had not the stock nor any intention of procuring it, and the purchase had no expectation that it would.ever'be delivered. to him. There was~, in truth, no intention on either side that stock should be transferred, bat the contracts were to be settled Isy the .payment of differences, and on this footing the contracts actually were settled, Now, these contract are undoubtedly within the kind of contracts mentioned in the seownd branch of the 201st section, being cases where the stock bought or sold was not'actually transferred or delivered; but,inasmuch, as theyresolved themselves into wagers, and there was a loss of more than 201. in one dlay, the transaction on which that loss accrued, although more than a year befoen the filing of the petition for arrangement, comes within the first branch of the section. Then,with respect to the dealingszin Turkish 8crip, I may obsmerethatIt has beendecided thatdealingsinforeign funude or in shares, to be settled by payment of differenoes, do not come within the second branch of the 201st section, or within the statute of 7th Goeorge IL, cap. 8, commonly called Sir John Barnard's Act, but it has also been decide that such deafing resolve themselves into wagers within the meaning oft he 8th and 9th of Victoria, cap. 109, sec. tion 18 (swe "Nicholson v. Good," 5 El. and BL, 1013, and IIGurwood v. Blane," 11, C. B., 53); and by paritv of reason I think such dealings also resolve themselves into gaming or wagering within the meaninag of the first branch of the 201st section of the Bankrupt Law Conuoldatlon IAct. The bankrupt'is dealings in Turkih Scrip were of a like nature withhi bargains in Consols. On the 226 of Augut 1855, he purchased 1,0001. New Turkish Guaranntee Fur per Cenit. Scrip for the settlement. This is sold in September, and in October a like purchase and sale tak-es place, It was ntever intended that any scrip should be delivered, and the contrats were setted by payment of the difference, and on this a loss ccaccrued to the bankrupt of 811 17s. 6d-that is, 35-1,f12s. 6d. on the first transaction and 461, 5s. on the last, being on each oasion above 201. in one day. For the reasons which I have already given I mnust hold that these dealings in Turkish Scrip comae'within the meaning of the term 11gaming or wagering"1 in the first branch of the 201st section. I should say a word as to the case of "1Ex parte Wade," (25,La7rJujosial, N.S., Bankruptcy, p. 10) in which the Lord Justices granted a certificate after a certain periodl of nsupension, notwithstanding the bankrupt had incurred a loss of 4201, on a purchase of some Turkish Scrip for a future day; but without deciding whether the Court below (Commissioner Ayrton) was right or wrong in his constraction of the statute and in refusing the certificate. Lord J. Knight Bruce said that whatever the Court did was not to be considered a precedent for any other case, hut as one founded upon the particular facts of that case alone, which (his Lordship added) was a very special case. I must not, therefore, considerthatthe Court is in any way bound by the decision of the Lords Justices in "Er parte Wade." There 'was one other point made by Mr. Linklater. He said that the meaning of the 'words "gamaing or wagrn"in the first branch of the 201st section ofthBak rut Iaw Consolidation Act had not as yt bendefined by any Court, and therefore that thi Court would nxot be the first to give a meaning to those words, but would leave the question open, upon the supposition that the bankrupt mighit have the validity of his certificate decided at law. It appears to me, howvever, that it is one ef the fir-st duties of this Court to put a construction on the different sections of the statutesrelating to the law of bankruptcy, for the admninistration of which law the Court was especially constituted and made a Court of lAw and equity, to have superintenidence and control in all matters of bankruptcy, and to hear, determine, and make order in, am3ong other miatters of bankruptcy, "1any application for a certificate of conformitW,~' (Sieesetions 6 and 12 of Bankruptcy and Law Consolidation Act, 12th and 13th of Vic- toia cap. 106.) Then,.again, in the present day,a great object in law reform is to enable parties to get fl justice in one court and not to send parties for that purpse, and at great additional expense, from one court to anothe1r. Agabin, 'why Is the iet st hevldt fte etfct ob sent to anothercooart to be tried at law when it is already before a court of law constituted for the purpose of trying sucha qeston,andhowis ucha question to be trie in ny oher ourtof l'w In the first place, some creitor must bring an action, to whichthe ankrpt mght leadhisoertificate, But 'wh isanycrditr t besujeced o schtrouble and ex- p.enser And,is it tobe expoeted that acreditor will or is it just that he should, incur any further epnei h matter ? Then it is aaid if the cetfcaeb ef mduder the 201st section, on the ground of gmn,tebankrp has no opportunity of trying his right to his certificate at law; but this is not so now, however it might have been unde the old bankrupt laws. Thle bankrupt has the opepor. itmity of contesting ini the Court of Bankruptcy (a court of law and equity) hisi ht to hiscertificate-;adi h ug ment of the Court of = pZndftejdg by appeal to the Lords Justices, andafewrsifncsarY, to the House of Lords.

I have only to add that the allowance of the oertificate mustme refusod. On the application of Wr.

PoLrCE. Bow-sTRsv.-A young man of respectable appearance, named WMilm Thomas, evidently a north countryman, was placed in the dock, charged with defacing the grand staircse of the British Museum. Police-constable A 610 stated that he was on daty in the entrance-hall of the Museum at about 4 o'clock that afternoon (Tuesday), when he saw the defendant cuttin or scratching a name upon the French-polished balustrade of the grand staircase vwth some pointed instrument, which he threw away on seeing witness approach him. One of the attendants of the Museum had aiso been observing him. James Morgan, the attendant referred to, corroborated the offlcer's statement, and said that on examining the flat surface of the bannister, where he had been thus occupied, he foumd the name "wElen Clare" written in caDital letters, with the Initials "1W. T."' underneath. Mr. JAnDmL-It is really scandalous that our publc institutions, thrown oen so liberally for our en'oyment should be defaced in this manner by a set of idlers wrho must crawl their sUly names wherever they ¢o and,as Iun. derstandit coats a sovereign to remove this -gurement, I shall fine yon a pound, or commit you for a weekin defanlt.

Some evidence has already appeared, as the case was adourned for the attendance of he Injuxred m asn &homaa Robinson said, -Th. first I bad an idea of was on Isaturday, the 16th.

I was then oonveys to the hospital where I have been ever since, but I do not recollect much about it. Cross-examined by a solicitor for the defence.-I saw Mr. Brett, who Is far advanced in pregnancy, tring to separate them. I did not shake her. You knowi would niot be guilty of such a thing. Mr. Thomas Vincent Jackson, house-surgeon at the University Colege Hospital, was next sworn, and said,-On Sunday, the 17th of May, I was called to see the complainant. When I examined Robinson I found his clothe~ burnt with sulphuric acid, as well as the left side of his facoe and neck. He was perfoctly collapsed, and could not answer me any questions, -I -have- Mtonded him ever since. At first he was in great danger, but I ani in hopes that he wvll now recover. Hla symptoms are now not dangerous, although a great exteht of Iis fce is burnt. dPohle-constable Thomas Turner, 365 8, said,-On Swi-' the 17th, I was called to Church-way, Somers-town, to a e the prisoner into custody.

Between 10 and U o'clock on Sunday, the 17th ult., my husband sent my son for some snuff. ' When he passed the prisoner's shop the son of the prisoner said, " There he goes; mind your pockets, Fred." A fight ensued between the two boys, and my husband separated them. My husband then went away, and on his retun the prisoner, who was standing at the shop door threw a tin pot ful of vitriol over my husband's head. When he had done so, the prisoner said, " Take that, you old b-; that will warmn yon." My husband at first thought it was water, but he afterwards said, " Elizatt isvitriol, take me to the hospital; I*m burning."' When the prisoner was at the station he said, " Iabu glad I have done it, and I hope the old - will die." Mly husband is a broker. The whole of tbhe clothes he had on wrere burnt. I was also slightly Cross-exanined by the solicitor for the defence.-For the last five or six years the complainant and the defendant, who are rivals in trade, have continually quarrelled, and have each been to this court to complain. On one occasion my son was chaged with throwing vitriol over the dress of the prisoner's daughter, and was tried at the Central CrimInal Court and was acquitted. I was standing at the door when the vitriol was thrown, and heard the prisoner make use of the threats above alluded to. Mrm Isabella Mills said, that she resided next door to tho complainant, where she keeps a wardrobe shop. She saw the oys fighting, and heard the prisoner say, when Robinson passed him, "You -, I will warm yon." When he returned she saw something o over Mr. Robinson, but she did not know what it was. ;me of the stuff went over her, burnt her gown, and hurt her very much. Most of the articles hanging in front of her shop were also covered with the vitrioL and were quite spoilt. One of the lodgers also was burnt by some of the vitriol going over her. Mr. ConRrz asked the prisoner what he had to say in answer to the charge 9 The solicitor said, as it was his worship's intention to commit, he should reserve the defence. Mr. CORIE then committed the prisoner to Newgate for trial. TH-a-m.-JosephPomeroy, described as a carpenter, aged 37, Harriet King James, widow, 66, who is believed to be the mother of the last-named prisoner, Flizabeth Sophia Pomeroy, 37, and Harriet Pomeroy, 13, were brought before Mr. SxLm on remand charged with uttering base coIn, and with having instruments and moulds in their posseasion for the purpose of manufaoturing basw coin. Mr. Pollard, from the office of the Treasury Solcitor, said this was a case in which the Crown would prosecute, Mr. SELFZ said he did not think he should do right in committing the girl Harriet Pomeroy. She was very you and no doubt acted under the control and dictation of her parents, or, perhaps, was not awrre they wero doing wrong. He should therefore discharge her. The other prisonera, Earriet King James, Joseph Pomeroy, and Elizabeth Pomery, would be committed for trial at the next sessions of the Central Criminal Court Sou'uwABi.-Mr. Theodore Dupuis, the French master of Queen Elizabeth's Free Grammar School, situato in the parish of St. OlAvo's, Southwark, was summoned before Mr. CO3IBE for cruelly beating George James Mouls, a lad under 12 years of age, one of the scholas. Mr. FrancisW. Arkcoll, of the firm of Jones and Arkcoll, solicitors to the school, appred for the defendant. The complainaut,;a nice-looking lad, residing with his mother, a widow, at No. 7, John-street, Horselydown, said thAt he had boen one of the scholars of St. Olave's School about two years. The defendant was theFranch master. Iat Wednesday, the 27th ult., about 12 o'clock, he was sitting down in his class when another lad made him laugh, nlr. Dupuis then came towards him with a cane in kis hand and struck him with it seven or eight times on the back and loins. He went home about a quarter of an hour afterwards and told his mother, who examined his person and the next day_came to this court and obtaned a summons. Mcr. Arkool said that he was instructed to say that the lad was very Impudent, and it was necessary to castigate him to keep up the discipline of the school TheladW was the cause of his receivmg the cuts on his person by rolling about on the ground.

NOxsTO?T for fmnal examination on a charge of committing a maurderous assault on a young woman named Selina Witcher, servant to Mrs. Davis, U, LaurWeerrace, St. George's Bouthwark. It wil be recollected from the evidenoe adduced on the former examinations that on the morning o that day fortnight the prisoner called at the house of Mrs. Davis and asked to ee that person, and was told by her servant, Selina Witcher, that she was out, tho%h at the same time she was upstairs. The prisoner remin~e for a few mainutes linthe kitchen, and then wenLt into the garden, and while the g woman Witcher was engaged washing he came bed her and struck her a violent blow with something harcl on the back part of her head. She screamned out, upon which he exclaimed "Don't holloa- rll notshurt yon," and placed his left hand on her mouth. He then gave her a second and a third blow, upon which she threw ter arms up to save herseX and caught something which she believedato be the handle of the hammner produced, and which after a severe struggle she got away from him. She was taken to the house of a surgeon, bleeding profusely froma a severe wound on the back part of the head and for several das her life was in extreme danger. 4The young woman was closely examined by the mags-. trate vith a view of eliciting a motive or malice, but neither the cue nor the other could be discovered. The young woman said she had known the prisoner for the last two or three weeks, from his frequently calling on her mldtress, and on all the occasions of his so calling he did not 6vincoethe slightest disposition to anjger or unkindness, nor hdtesights differences taken place between them.' On the mornin of the assault she didnotobserveanythinginhi manner different from usual, and she was quite certain he did not say a single word to her kefore he struck her. lMrs Davis, the mistrm of the proiecutrin, said she knew the prisoner for many year; and knew his late wife also. He visited her at her hor.e, andl had a short time since made her an offer of marriage, buLt she declined it, as it did not suit her to change her present position. She did not recollect having given her servant any particular directions to deny her to the prisoner, buLt bein prc'uLarly engaged on the morning in question she to her she was not at home to any one. She heara aviolent scream on the morning of the asault, and also heard her servant call out to her not to come downstairs, else she would be murdered. She became so alarmed that she jumped outo f a window on to the flat roof, and received such inijuries in her falL that she was still attended by a medicalman, and not yet recovered. The prisoner, in reply to the charge, said he belonged to the Criean land Transport Corps, and his health became so impaired while before Sabastopol that he was confined to hisbed all the way home, and on the arrival of the ship at Portsmouth was carried from on board to the hospia.L There ho remained a considerable tine, and was at length enabled, though with a shattered frame and constitution, to come to town and renew his trade, that of a painter and glaeer. On the Monday (the day preceding the assault) he had taken a contract for some work, and had unfortunately Threprisoner'sisster, ta respdetable ioman, corroborated muhadntteshetrcleto of what h had occuredda Mr. NoRTox was disposed to believe rauch of what the prwsoner had acd, band that his condurt wns more the resot womadrn,tand of rth dtaedwould,tandeam ereforvew oe ddntsethe prsner'ssister,oafrspecdngtabe cwoman,forroboatedz Yet the prisoner had committed a most serious assault on the young woman, and it wras almost a mercy he did not kll her, or, according to the evidence of the surgeon, it was only the making up of her hair into a round ball or tuft that saved her.

THB OXFORD DIOCESAV SPIRIWJAL HELP SOCIEY. Yesterday afternoon a meeting w/s held in thn Sheldenia 'Theatre, at Oxford, to establishandiduagurate 4heabove society. Theattendonce Sswoge,'influentirl, atd included a considerable number of ladies. The Bishop -o2 Oxford presided; and among the,geu.9men precnt reo-te two members of tho University, -*r. Gladsone cud Sir W. Heathcote, the Marquis of Blandfor4, mr. Henley, ILP., Colonel North, ALP., lIr 'G. HEarooust, Ie., Mr. Lang. ston, IT.P., the Vice-Chancellor of the University, the Iev. Drs.

Partridge, Barter, Milman, Butler, 'Wateley, Russell, Lloyd, Greswell, and many otqierclergyssen. The Bishop of OXFORD,-NY rev. Ibretbren, and my brethren of the laity, I have first tothsg, those who hava bssemblad hero to-day in eonseqesnoe et the invitation which, at the desire of the rural deans of this diocess, I forwarded to them, requesting th2em to aid in 1aying thLe foundations of a new diocesan institution, which, under the blessing of God, 'will be, I believe, productive of the grenatest spiritual advantage to this district. My own part in the proceedings of the day will be almost entirely to lay before you certain statistics which will abun. dantly justify in the mind of every thoughtful man among us the making of this attempt. My duty will be so confmied principally for this reasor that I have the great happiness of having here those who have undertaken to move and second the different resolutions which wiiU be founded upon the facts which these statistics disclose, and who wil be able to putan object sofully before you. in all its bearings that it would be a waste of time for me to trouble Y9U with an opening address. ItwilU be my first duty to show you exactly what the constitution of the proposed so8iety will be, and the nature of the want which it is intended to supply. The title of the society, which has been adopted after some thought, Is this-" The Oxford Diocesan Spiritual Help Society." Its object is to supply, as far as we are able by voluntary belp, some of the deficiencies of the parochial system in its present working throughout the diocees. I would next say a word as to the Way in which it is prop osed that this help should be rendered. We do not intend to interfere in the slightest degree with that responsibility which is placed in the incumbents of the different parishes. Neither the committee nor any individual member of it shall use the least influence as to the persons whom the incumbents may select to assistthem intheirwork. There shaU be no previous selection of persons outof whomthe inoumbentsaretochooseWe shall make no attempt even to satisfy ourselves that those whom the ircumbents may be pleased to have for their curates are fit to fill such a position. That responsibility, we believe, rests with the incumbent of a parish alone, and we think it would be a wrongful interference 'with him if we were to attempt to dictate or suggeat to him whom he should choose to help him in his work. (Hear, hear.) Of course, there are modes in which that might be done. There is one great society the founders of which have thought it their duty to endeavour to secure the employment of active and efficient clergymen. I do not blame them; it is not my part to criticize any other institute ; but I mention the fact for the sake of stating as distinctly as possible that in our deliberations with a view to the formation of this society that principle was set aside. You will see that no society such as ours can attempt to secure ectivity and efficiency without iu some degree fixing the colour in theological matters of those vho are sent to help incumbents in their parishes. Now,v we hold that the responsibility of selecting the righbt man belongs to the incumbent himselfnot to us; and what we desire and initend to do is to furnish hiim with the means which bis own income does not afford of obtaining the assistance which he requires in his parisb. (Hear, hear.) We have in view another, though a minor, object, upon which I may be allowed to say a few words. It often happens that clergymen are obliged to leave their parishes for a certain time on business, for necessary relaxation, and the like, and they have great difficulty in finding temporary assistance during that period. Now, it is proposed to aid clergymen in that way, and also to enable them to procure the services of brother clergymen in the preaching of such specal sermons -charitable and others-as they do not wish to deliver themselves. There are many clergymen here in Oxford, for example, who would be glad, if their expenses were paid, to render assistance in this way to their parochial brethren, affording a nececsary supplement to the parochial system; and we propose to make grants for such spedial occasion& These, then, are the two great objects of our society; but there is one other point upon whtch I ought to touch,-viz., the relation of our society to existing institu. tions of the same character. We do not propose to make this a branch of any existing society, because we believe we may look for more help in our own diocess, if we say to the owners of property and the inhabitants generally, "Here are wants around your own doors-claims upon the property with which you yourselves are connected; and, whUe we desire to quicken you in assisting other and distant places that are spiritually destitnte, we yet think that your own people have a prior claim upon you." We think that in this way we might not only do a great deal of good at home, but also promote the interests of the more general societies. Let it be distinctly understood that we do not wish any man to withdraw his subscription from the general societies. Our funds wiU be expended in the relief of our necessities at home, and no portion of them will go to destitute places at a dis. tance, which, however, stand much in need of assistance, There is one great reason why we should minister to our own necessities rather than depend upon the bounty of the more general societies. Occupying an agricultural diocess, with, Comparatively speaking, few-great populations gathered into Certain places in it, we cannot compete, in the view of the general societies, with the vast populations which are spring. ing up in the manufacturing and mining districts, if mere number is to be the measure of relief required, and not the mixed measure of the wants of the people and their claims upon those who dweU near them and possess property. (Hear.) The resnlt is that we have no right to complain of any unfairness if our case is postponed. The fact remains, how. ever, that we get scarcely anything from the general societies, end therefore, if any relief at aU is to be adminis. tered to our own people, it must be administered by a society which, advancing its elaims upon the ground of pro. perty and neighbourhood, is able to take the actual wanut ef the diocess into consideration, and not its relative claims compared with those of other parts of the Country. We wish nothing but good to the general societies. One of them in particular-the Additional Curates Society-gets cono siderable support from the resident members of this University, and deservedly so, because many of those members are connected by birth, edueation, or relationship with the distaut places where the wants of the people are so pressing We feel, too, that if through the blessing of God we can in any degree raise the spiritual condition of the people in thii diocess we shall be preparing them to answer more liberall, and generously than heretofore the appeals of the general societies, because just in proportion as a district becomes religious does it give off streams of charity to those other parts which need ouch assistance. (Hear, hear.) I have now explained the object of this societv, the special grounds upoa which we think it ought to be founded, and its relation to existing institutions of the same kind. It remains that I should give you some statistics showing what reaUy are the vants and necessities of this diocess. There are, in the first place, come cases in which the population has grestly out' grown the sapply intended for t'heir spiritual wants, and yet where the endowments are so small that it is impossible fo4 the incumbents, out of those endowments, to 'obtain the assistance which they require. The large agricultural parish -of Caversham contains ascattered population of 1,642 souls, 'with an endowment of 1161. a-year. Nothing more astonishes me than the large amount of wealth which the clergy of the Church of England draw from their privato ,sources in aid of the scanty incomes which they derive from their beneficea. In many instances they bring to the church something like twiceor tbree times as much as they Teceive from it. A.s a profeoson thov certainly are not paid for the work which they perform. WVith an income of only 1161. a-year it is impossible for a married clergyman -and remember it is one of our special characteristies bat vwe desire, for great moral reasons, our clergy to be married, whichinereases their expenses considerablyto maiatain himself and bisfamily in anything like a r -Iocessol maner 5o- maitai a se f e inigo reaectale maner, To maintai stofmn in religoas hownes would be far cheaper then to scatter Clristian families over the land with all the healthful and purifying influenoo of domestic lie; and thessfore, if that is to be the princie of the Church of England, it implies a larger provision or the clergy thn would otherwise e necessary, and most aissedly no man can minister to 1,042Esouls scattered over a wide area, or with 161. a-year is able to mnaintin in any way any sort of family, much less to have another to help -him in his rork, Here are some more cases:-CnippingNorton has a population of 3,03l souls-endowment 1291. a-year; Dorchester, a population of 1,078 souls-erldowment, 1001. ; St. E-bbe's, in this city, a population of 4,169 sourendowment, 111U I could gxve you many other ca s of the same kind, bat let me rather state one or two illustrating a dieent state of things. Abingdon has a popUtion of 5,630 covd, withva-4 endowment of 22651 a-year. ISt. Mary's, Readig, cortains apopulation of 9,148 rotlas twe endowm nstis 0 I.- but still there are 9,148 souls to bo previded for. Taking the whole of one clas of cazes together, I find that there is need for 67 additional ourates, to furnish oneclergvmau for evo;y 1000 ouls, I wish now to direct your attention-to those pa. riebesin whichtheinomesof the inaerubentsare sasmall=th two or threo have to be put togetherto make up the suallv,st pittance upon which a clergman can gabsis. The R* I/i aIecessarily'ls a diminution in the servicea in the sev*ral churches-ohe m.'vice a'day i nAteA of the regular persices of the church; and. therefore the wandeDing of the peiple, Borne to the beersbop, sos e to total idl&n , aotnp-to Adiffereat hdnds of dissent. In those parishes tbe Chut5f of England is not 'discharging her duty in supplying the rpiritual wanuts of the people by her own clergy. I find that in 86 parishes, with 88 churches and a population of 47,000, the average income of an incurabent is only 724- 10a. lere, then, my case is at onoe made out, that in these ptishes there is rot at presaent the means requisite for rrinster-ing to the spiritual necessities of the people. (Hear, hear.) Going a littlefurther, we bave 71 parishes with 87 churches, and apopulation of 72,000, in which the average income of an inunmbezit is 133. 10s. Taking thetwo clases together, we have 157 parishes with 175churches, andaan aggregate population of 120,000. in which the average income of an uLcumbent is under 1001. This, too, is in tbse time of health and strength, when the ineum. beats are able to do their duty; but, remember, these men are liable to beill, to grow old, to be worn out by work; and when they are ill their expenses are increased, while as they grow old they want rather more than less. It is manifest, as the statistics have shown you, that in this agricultural diocossthero isa vastdefidcencyin thefundsneedful for supplying tho people with spiritual food. The result weall know. In many instances the people are gathereda together in hamlets, a distance of two or three nmiles from the residence of the clergyman and. the. soth6r.dhurch. These hamlets are outlying posts of demoralization, where the beershop is haunted, where the greater and lesser trans. ressions against the laws of property are devised and executed, where occasionally we see rising and flourishing for a season some exciting form of religious belief, because the people know so little of the ordinary teachitg of Chris-. tianity that they are ever ready to be kindled into. a wild and tempestuous flame by any spark that may fall among them. (Hear, hear.) Rence these hamlets becoune pests end sores which the clergy cannot reacb, which lower the moral tone of the whole district, and which, by leading men away from the loyal affection which their fathers bore to the church, increase religious delusions and divisions. Among the places I have mentioned are, Colnbrook, with a population of 1,400 souls-endowment, a house, and four acres of land; Sandford, viith a population of 341 sonlsendowment, 151. a-year; Hazelmere, a population of 1,160 souls-endowment, 431. As illustrating another class of cases, take East B3adon with apopulation of Z72 souls-endowment 304 a year; and WVoodstocl, a chapelry of the old parish of Braden, with a po ulation of 1,400 souls-endowment 121 a year. We have ceen enabled in some of these places to build new churches, but the difficulty is to find endowments for them. In the hamlet ?of Grazeley, for example, with a population of 400 souls, we have built a church, but the endowment is only 301. a year. Many cases might be mentioned in which new churches have been built and now districts formed to meet the pressing necessities of a growing population, but in which no suffi. clent endowment has been provided, though it is the principle of our church that every incumbent should be K:o from the cares of poverty aud able to give his whole thoughts and heart to the performance of his sacred functions. Let ua not raise questions as to how this has come to pam. The want is here; let us endeavour to supply it. I have made out my case, and it affords me much pleasure to inform yon that many influential landowners have already expressed their determination to support our sciety. Snbsoriptihs of 50l. each have been received from Mr.Lbouchere, MP., Mr. Grenfell, 2I.P., llr. Harcourt, MY., klr. Sawyer, sad others, some of whom have also announced their intention of becoming annual subscribers, The right, rev, prelate concluded by calling upon Mr. GLADSTONE to move the first resolation. The right hon. gentleman, who was received with cheers, said,My Lord Bishop, the resolution which I have to propose to the meeting is to the following effect:- 'That dncee te e tabushment of our Parocbial syrtem a great increase ba- taken place in the number ot our people. aud a greawchanre In their orcumataucee relatIvely to their participation Jnthe benefits ot Its est3blishmeat." There is, to my mind, no more remarkable example of the powerful practical genius of the English nation than the completeness of that parochial organization which it established throughout the land at a time of comparative poverty, when commnunications were difficult, when many mechanical facilities and advantages which we now possess in perfection were denied to our forefathers. In proposing a tithe for the support of the ministry they adopted the best and most ancient form of endowment, which had recived the sanction of Divine authority, and, in imposing upon property the maintenance of the fabric of the church they ests.- blishedtheobligation of the conmmunityto provide for the services of religion, and the right of every man-a right which Iam glad to say is yet in some places exercised-to accommodation in his parish church. (Hear, hear.) The system founded by our ancestors has proved its own admifable qualities by the manner in which it has stood the shocks of time, In England it has been exposed to a harder and heavier pressure than in any other land. About 100 yeas ago commenced that vast increase in the population of the country and that general shifting of its position which have given occasion to the present and other callS upon our benevolence. There is something remarkable in the circumstances under which that great change began. The population commenced to grow and the demand for religious instruction began to increase just at a period whe, unfortunately, a spirit of indifference to religion was beginning to-rest, like a deadlg nightshade, upon England. The last century ofrs to our view a period in which our liberties were secured and our institutions consolidated, but it must be admitted that towards the commenooment of that period the erading and governing class was lower in point of morality than it had been during any preoeding generation, and that the standard of life and practice among the clergy was relaxed and degrrded. At s8ah a time it was that human beings began to multiply in the land, and the neglect of their spiritual wants waS continued so long that it w&s at last feared no adequate remedY could be applied. The last 25 or 30 years has been a period of only comparative activity. If we have kept pace with the positive increase of spiritual destitution during the same time we have done no more; but, at aU events, we have every encouragement to proceed in our efforts. Among the governing class of the community we sbould now look in vain for that indifference to religion wbich was so prevalent in former times; while, with respect to the clergy, something yet more decided may be said. The late Mr. Greuville, a few days before he completed his 90th year, declared in my presence that the greatest chauge he had witnessed during his long life was that which had taken place in the character of the clergy-a change, not only in the nature of an improvement, but amounting to a transformation. (Hear, hear.) Undoubtedly, my Lord Bishop, the considerations connected with the deficiencies of our parochial system acnd the increase of our population apply more to other portions of the oonntry than to this diocess. Yet I think there is a great deal of fallacy in our treat ment of figures upon these subjects. A clergyman i not able to minister to more than 1,000 psrson', and if he is sent unaided into a parish or district where there are 10,000 or 20,000 he finds himself launched upon a flood of population wholly beyond his powers to manage, and he becomes not their real but their nominal pastor. He would be able to do as much, if not more good in a parish of 1,000 persons. 'Hear, hear.) Such is the opinion which was entertained by the late Dr. Chalmers, and it therefore appears to me that you are right in proposing to supply the wants of your own people at home, divided as they are into manageable populations, rather than to exhaust your ener. gies upon distant and densely populated districts. I think, too, that you have hit upon the proper method of doing the work. Formerly it was the practice to build churches in new districts in the hope that they would oreate congregations for themselves. It was a great mistake. The erection of churches alone has not had that tendency ; indeed, in many instances the result has been the very reverse, and now you propose to escape from that vicious course of proceeding, and contemplate the workof spiritual improvemuent through the medium of additional clergymen. There is another false method which I regret to say has not yet been fully exploded. The subject of education is one of vast importanee, and there is no person in public or private life who does not admit that the means of education should be as rapidly as possIble both extended and improved. Yet I must confess that I sometimes hear language used upon that subject which fils me with jealousy and misgivings-language which wouldgiveu8to understandthat aoertain mechanica process of multiplyingschoolsand schoolmasters would oure the whole moral disease of the community. If such expectations are entertamiedI believe theY wi) be disappointed. The schoolmaster .is an essential agent in the work of public improvement; but, after all, he is a human invention, a seeondary instriument, whose business, is ln the first place, to supply the deficiencies of parents, and, in the second, to furnish a complement to the ministrations of the Church. It will be a bad day for England when he usurps the functions of the Christian minister, let his hands be. strengthened; let the sYstem of education be more religions; but do not let religion stop there. Even in school the influence of the clergyman must be felt, aud it must continue to be exercised for the benefit of young persons long after they have left schooL The right hon. gentleman concluded by expressing his warmest wishes for the success of the proposed society. Mrr. RLtcorsourr seconded the resolution, which was carried with aclatmation. The other resoluitions, which we subjoin, were moved and secondedi by Sir W. p eatho te, Colonel Nort,b Mr. Ray- mond Barker, mhr. Bffard, the Ma rquis ot Blrhdford, the 1telv. C. Lloyd. M r.

Wallis, Conmander-in-Chief for the South East Cost of America Station, arrived at Spithead yesterday morning from Sheerness. In crossing the Channeishe fell in with the Admiralty yacht Osborne, having rthe Grand Duke Constantine on beard, and, although under a press of sail before the wind, ahe took all in, rounded to, ind fired a Royal salute. General Sir John F. Burgoyne, G.C.B., R.E., InspectorGeneral of Fortifications, accompanied by Sir Francis Hesd, paid a visit to the head-quarters of the Royal Engineers at Chatham yesterday for the purpose of inspecting the new buildings for the ma'rled men of the Royal Engineers and the stables for the engineer train which have recently been erected, together with the field-works which are now being carried on by the trops. The visit of Sir FrancisHead to Chatham is understood to be for the purpose of making ar rangements for instricting the men of the6 mounted A troop of the Royal Engineer Train in the use of the lasso, in order that they may be acquainted with it previously to embark. ing for foreign service. The annual inspection of the Royal Marine Light Infantry will take place this morning on Chatham Lines by Mojor General Lord Rokeby. | Captain Pigou's company of the 2d battalion Royal Artillery assembled yesterday in the mortar-battery on Woolwich-common and practised shell firing over a flight of 800 yards. The result of the firing was successful, some of the sheUs alighting in close proximity to the target, while the widest range did not exceed 40 feet. Admiralty instructions were yesterday issued to Captain Noddall, in command of Her Majesty's screw steamship Agamemnon, cancelling her recent order to proceed to Birkenhead, and directing that the former order to ship the Transatlantic cable from East Greenwich shall hold good. The United States' ship Niagara having been inspected by Mr. Dallas, the American Minister, it was decided that the necessary arrangements should be entered into by the ship. wright department of the dockyard, so as to adapt tha vessel for the reception nnd transport of her intended por. tion of the electric cable from Liverpool. Colonol Brown, commandant of the Royal Marine force at Woolwich, has received notice from the Admiralty that their Lordships have dcided on granting to sergeants of the Marine corps the good-conduct pay, on an equal ratio 'with the sergeants of the Royal Artilery, the regulation to date from April 1, 1857. The Archer, 14, Captain Heathoote, left Spithead yesterday for the eastward to be paid off. She sailed from Greytown April the 15th, and Port Royal the 27th, and had an exceUent run from that station, with strong westerly winds. She brought home six naval invalids from the West India squadron. The Mariner, 12, sailing sloop, Commander Palliser, left Spithead yesterday for the eastwardc to be paid off. She arrived on the previous day from the West India station; sailed from Port Royal March 19th; arrived at Real Bay, Greytown, March 24th, sailed 26th; arrived at Havannah April 8th, saled 18th; arrived at Nassau, New Providence, on the 22nd, sailed 28th; made the Land's End May 25th. She brought home a mail from Nassau, and 34 men from Her Majesty's ship Orion, late of the Imperieuse.

Since she left England she sailed over 52,091 miles of ocean. The Esmouth, 91, Captain Eyrea, C.B., the Colossus, 81, Captain Thompson, and the Brik, 14, Commander Curtis, have left Spithead for Devonport, to be paid off; and the Eurydice, 28, Captain Tarleton, C.B., and the Malacca, 17, Captain Farquhar, have proceeded to Sheerness to be paid of£ The Volcano steam-vessel (floating smithery), Master Commander Hockdey, will sail from Spithead this day for China. The Brune, 2 paddlewheel vessel, tenderto the Vesuvin6, arrived at Spithead from Sheerness yesterday. The WeUesley Indiaman, 1,150 tons, Captain Smith, embarked her passengers at Spithead on Monday evening, and sailed subsequently for Madras and Calcutta, calling at the Mauritius. The Hastings, 60, screw blockship, Captain Mends, C.B., went out of harbour to Spithead yesterday, and after trying her speed returned and anchored. The foHowing appointments were made yesterday at tbe Admiralty:- C. C. Hassall, E. B. H.Bevan, and G. G. Webber. midship. inen, to the Ccrdelia; Henry FY'eeling and W. S.

- THE SEAAfEN OF rHE NORTH-EAST PORSC The seamen of the Tyne and Wear are signing a petion to Parliament wherein they Etate various facts with regard to the loss of life and property in the North Sea. They a'sert that- , "Dsters at sea and oss of life and property are on tho increase, more particularly along; the coasts of York. shie, Durham, And Northumberland. The Admiralty Register of Wrecks and Casualties on or crear the coasts of the United Kingdom presents the foUowing results :_ Year. Shipwrecks. Lives lost, 1852 ... ... ... ... 1,015 ... ... M- 853 ... ... .. 8 ... 832 ... 6... 689 184 ..9 ... ... .. 987 .. ... 1,549 18:55 ... ... ... ... 3,14L ... ... 469 1856 , ... ... ... 1,153 ... ... 5n Total ... ... 5.128 ... .. 4,148 "Although the number drowned in 1856 shows A dimint. tion as compared with 1852, 1853, end 1854, there is an increase over 1855; yet the number of persons rescued from wrecks in 1855 was 1,388, and in 1856 the record gives the number of persons saved from drowning on loss of ships as 2,153, thus demonstrating that 765 more human beings were imperiled by wrecks and casualties on the coast in 18E6 than in 1855, and that the rescae of so many passengers or seamen from a premature death was, under Divine Providence, chiefly owing to the increase of hfeboat stations, and of other modes of succour at hand on emergency. "Your petitioners would direct the attention of your honourable House to what, in their judgment, gained from daily experience, are the causes to be reasonably assigned for this decrease of security of life and property at sea:-First, incompetent crews; second, vessels sailing under. maimed; third, the increase of mixed crews speaking different languages; fourth, the inorease of steamers, and the collisions by steamers, frequently from no lookout being kept, or landsmen being at th- helm; fifth, crews of ordinary seamen or landsmen navigating ships and being ignorant of the marke of the lead; sixth, scnding vessels to sea in an unseaworthy state, either from defective hUls, leakage, bad ground tackle, or old and useless sails, worn out rigging, or rotten spars. But, coming more directly to the losses on the north-east coast of England, your petitioners are fuUy persuaded that many lives might be saved by the erection of a harbour of refuge; for in 1852 one fourth of the whole reported wrecks, on or off the shores of the united kingdom, occurred within a radius of 70 miles of the Wear and Tyne; and in the eame year in one gale 69 lives were sacrificed in a few hours wtin 20 nautical miles. That, again, in 1854, confined to the same radius, 110 wrecks took place, accompan.ed with a dreadful loss of life and destruction of property. That in 1855, out of 1,141 casualties, 576 occurred on the east or north-east coast of England; and in 1856, out of 1,153 casualties, 506 happened on the east coast, the greater part of them between Flamborough Head and Berw=ck. " Your petitioners would further direct attention to the bleak and dgerous nature of the coast between the River Hiimber and the Frith of Forth. All the harbours comprised between those rivers are tidal ones, not one of them admitting a vessel in distress at low water, and several of them being quite dry at low ebb of the tide. As a striking contrast to the utter neglect of the State to the necessities of trade, commerce, and the protection of shipping property, your petitioners produce here the amounts voted bv your honourable House to those parts of the coasts of the-united kingdom on or off which the least number of lives are sacrificed, viz. Holyhead Harbour, 1840 to 1855 ... ... ... 819,748 Ditto, 1856 ... ... .. ... ... ... 207,305 Dover Harbour, 1840 to 1855 . ... ... 278,00 Harwich Harbour, 1840 to 1855. ... ... 125000 Dtto, 1856 ... ... ... ... ... 7,000 Dover Harbour, 1856 .... ... . 34,000 Portland larbour and Breakwater, 1840 to 1856 647,000 Channel Islands, 1840 to 1856 ...3... ... 867,000 Harbour of Scotland, 1840 to 1856 . 77,240 Fishery Harbomrs of Ireland (9 Vic., c. 3) 50,000 Ditto (10 and 11 Vic., c. 75) ... ... ... . ... 90,000 Kingstown Harbour, 1840 to 18.56.. . ... .. 173,067 Howth, Dunmnore, and Donaghadee, 1840 to 1856 3,641 SuLms voted, 1840 to 1856, inclusive ... £3,388,001 "That, out of the sum of 3 388,00ll. voted by Parliament for the construction of havens of refuge, not one penny has been lhid out in providing a shelter for the shipping trading along the north-east coast, though its trading vessels outnumber those from the more southern ports s three to one. Moreover, in the event of a war, there ic no secure anchorage from capture from enemies' vesaels from the Humber to the Shetland Isles, thus, in case of maritime hostilities, endangeing the whole of the trading vessels, as wel as those trading to tne North Sea ports of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark to the coast of Germany, up the Baltic, and to the continental ports in Holland, Belgium, and France. These facts your petitioners cannot but think have been overlooked when plans and estimates for harbours of refuge have been submitted to yonr honourable House. I.Your petitioners, inconnexion with the discussion of oss atrea of-life and-property, would direct the notice of your hon. Honse to the many crews that have been im-prisoned for refusig tosl inmnneswaorthy-ships; nd -for redress in such cases your petitioners have no remedy at law. In the Admiralty Record of Wrecks, laid before your hon. House by command of Her Majesty, the Bnard of Trade authorities report that of the inquiries into wrecks in 1856 there were, among others,- Ships abandoned from unseaworthiness ...17 Foundered from unseaworthiness .. . 37 Lost or stranded:- From defective compasses . . 14 From defective charts ... . ... ... 5 From improper stowage of anchor1... ... .. I From combustion of steam-coal from want of ven- tilation. .10 Through lakage... ... ... .. ... ... 87 171 If in one year 171 vessels are thns totally lost or stranded on or off the coasts of the united kingdom, it is clear that some sort of supervision of vessels is urgently demanded; and it goes far to prove that seamen are punished for exercising a rational opinion when they docline to go to sea in vessels which they believe to be quite unsafe to contend against the elements. And your petitioners wotdd further remark, that the 171 vessels referred to in the preceding figures do not include the hundreds of vessels that sail and are never heard of again - nor the losses or casualties over sea, or beyond the coats of the united kingdom. " Your petitioners therefore humbly Pray that your honourable House will afford them Legislative protection from false imprisonment, by compelling owners of vessels to submit their vessels for survey before departure, and to see that the place set apart for seamen is sufficient for health and cleaniness, the better enabling the seamRen to do their duty ; and that a harbour of refuge may be forthwith constructed on the north-east coast of England. "And your petitioners further pray that your honourable house will give no weight to the excuse lately pat forth by official men, that because one corporation out of the ten maritime borougbs on the north-east coast continues to levy rates on goods carried by shipping, though sanctioned by an Act of Parliamrent passed only seven years ago (1850), therefore the entire shipping of the north-east coast shall be exp,oed to continual wreck, and Briti.h seamen to perpetual destruction; as if it were possible for any corporation to supply the place and perform the duty of Government."
FiRE AND Loss OF LIFE.-Yesterday evening a fire broke out in a house, No. 18, Upper Mansfield-place, Kentish-town. A poor woman named Warner, who works at an adjacent laundry, had left her youngest child in bed in a room on the ground floor. The eldest boy, who was entrusted with the care of the rest, went with thenm into the fields; and there can be no doubt thar tho deceased George Warner got out of his bed and began to play with some lucifer matches. When the fire was discovered the poor child was burnt to a cinder, nor could his bodv be got out of the house at the time. Nothing but the wahls were left standing, and great damage was done to the surrounding property. The ground landlord is Mr. Hlolmes, and the leases of these houses were on the point of falling in. FALKIRK BAxr, E£MEzzLEMtuNT.-We are informed that late last night a telegraphic communication reached this citv, which has since been confirmed by letter, JntimatingthatXenrySalmon, thedefaultingbankagent, wbo recently a* econdel fromn' alkirk, committed suicide yesterday Snuday) forenoon, by han z himsef in the stable of the zpl,Con way,North oxh les.-kdiurglh Courant of Monday-'Mr. Salmon had, as minager of the Falkirk branch of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, which situation ne had fiOed for a long series ofyears, been a defaulter to the extent of about 26,0001., the discovery baving been made about a fortnight ago by a clerk from the head-office, when the deceased was absent at Stirling, and aitgig on the bench asinstice of the peace. NEARLY BuRIED AwIVF-A letter from Cleves, Hamiltou county, Ohio, says-"l Wat Eckman, a wealthy citizen of this place, was taken violently ill on the mornin" of the 15th, and by having the prompt and kind services ol two eradite Esculapiuses, received his "quietus" about 5 o'clock the samei day. Next morning the defanct Eckman was kindly stowed away in his coffin, and jolted in a market waggon to Berea Church, a distance of two miles, where a funeral sermon was preached by the Rev. W. Lee. The solemn thing was about ooncluded, the last hytnn was read, and the choir was about to "strike up," when they were saddenly annoyed by discordant and very unmusical sounds and kicks which it seemed obvious were going on inside the coffin. You may possibly imagine there was some consternation in that meetinghouse about that time-well, there was nothing else for a few minute;. At least half of the congregation broke for the door, and the kbalance wore about to "follow suit," when the Rev. Mr. Lee descended from the pulpit, and in a loud voice ordered the coffin to be speedily opened, which was done, when it was found that Wat was not only alive ar,d kicking, but was stru gling manfully to free himeelf from his-to him-mysteinous confinement, The blood was ilowing freely from his mouth and nose, but in a few minutes he was able to speak. He was carried to tho house of Mr. Abram Pattereon, about 200 yards from the, church, and a physician sentfor, who remained with him until the next morning, when he was-able to walk about the room.- P"hicdpAicz .dvreiiing Bulletin, 9th of May.
