BBGfrom Penryn in favour of the Sale PRIVATE BUSINESS. Colonel WILSON PATTEN stated that the Committee ef Selection being unable, owing to the unusual pressuro of private business, to follow the usual practice of giving an option to members of the period or tho session at which kee would serve on Private BiUl Committees, were neverthe ess anxious to consult the convenience of members as far as possible; and if they would intimate to the Committee ofSelection atwhat time it wouldbe most convenient to them toserve every endeavour would be made to comply with their wishes. Should no such intimation be made it would be considered that any period wvould be equally convenient. (Hear, hear.) The hon. and gallant member then zmoved that standing order No. 90 be suspended so far as regards Road Bills, and that the Committee of Selection lhav power to refer all Road Bills, whether oppoed or n- opposed, t'o committees of selected members." The motion was agreed to. JUDGM-ENTS EXECUTION BIIIX Mr. CRAUFURD, in moving the second reading of this Bil, briefly explained its provisions for the information of the new members. At present, he said, whenever a creditor recovered a judgment in any of the courts of England, Scotland, or Ireland, no execution could issue upon it except within the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment wns obtained. A judgment procured in any one of the three kIngdoms was, in fact, treated as a foreign judgment in the other two, and required to be proved before it could have any value or be applied to any practical purpose. In the case of a judgment obtained in England, for example, the debtor could evade it by crossing over to Ireland, and before the creditor could touch either his person or property he must raise a fresh action in one of the Irish courts, end must prove his judg. ment before he could have it entered up in that court. Bat that was not all. The debtor might then proceed to Scot' land, where the same process would have to be gone through again, so that the creditor might be put to the trouble and expense of raising three actions instead of one. Such a state of things appeared to him to be most anomalous and absurd, and, what was of stiUl more importance, little coaducive to the interests of the commnercial community. He was seeking to remedy it by introducing, instead of an action at law, a simple registration of the original judgment, and his Bill provided that when ajudgment was issued bya competent court an official uiotification of it to the courts of the other two kingdoms should be sufficient warrant for them to enter up the judgment and issue execution. Such vas the plain and simple object of the BilL By agreeing to the second reading of the Bill the House would do no morm than sanction its principle, leaving the details to be altered and amended in committee. He did not propose to alter the law or to trench upon the jurisdiction of any court; and, in these cir. eumstances, he confidently hoped that his motion would be carried by a large majority. He hoped the House would give their sanction to the principle of the Bill by reading It a second time. In order to meet the views of as many members as possible he had introduced into the measure several amendments which he had beard suggested in the course of the last four years Among these were amendments suggested by the AttornevGenexal for Ireland, which he hoped would make the Bill more acceptable in that country, and also certain amendmeats apphcable to Scotland. He trusted, therefore, that the Bill would receive the approbation of the House, and now moved that it be read a second time. Colonel FRENCH thought that, so far from this being a Bill to facilitate the recovery of debts, it might be more appropriately described as a Bill to inflict on England and Ireland the barbarisms of the Scoteh law. (" Hear," and a laugh.) It had been clearly shown, when the Bill was before the House last session, that, under its operation, a man who had gone to Scotland to enjoy the shooting might find, without any previous intimation being given, an execution upon his house and property foradebteontracted in England. The Bill had received the opposition of every Irish member, and yet the hon. gentleman persisted in pressn it upon the Houie, refusing to take the advice given him by the Lord-Advocate to confine its operation to England and Scotland. Removed as an amendment that the BMll be read a second timethat day six mouths. Mr. BLAND seconded the amendment. Though the Bill professed to give perfect reciprocity to the three kingdoms in the execution of judgments, the balance would he greatly against Ireland. It was not enough to say that executions snould run from one country to another. To make the benefits reciprocal the law under which judgments were obtained should be the same in all the three kingdoms; but this was not the case. From various causes the law regard. ing judgments operated in Ireland with much more efficiency and force when applied to lands and tenements than in England or Scotland, so that an English judgment, executed in Ireland would have greater effect and force than when directed against lands and tenements in this country. The heon and learned gentleman said he had adopted the amendments suggested by the Attorney-General for Ireland- but there was one which he had not introduced into the Bill, and that 'was to give the Court that was asked to give a judgment full control over that judgment. That suggestion Involved a great principle which was entirely omitted from the BilL. Not only the lawyers but the commercial community of Ireland w-ere opposed to this Bill, and he hoped that it would not receive the sanction of the House, (Hear, hear.) MEr. AYIiTON would support the Bill if he were satisfied that it was really a measure of law reform; but it appeared to him to be in that respect a proceeding entirely in the wrong direction. There was a demand for a codification of the law, but while they made that demand they should be careful to have their legislation consistent with the codification which they required. There were different modes of procedure in England, Ireland, and Scotland ; but that was not a matter which they conld hope to amend at once, or by such a Bill as the present. It would certainly be a most inconvenient thing for a person who happened to be on a visit to Ireland to find that ajudgment recorded against him in England was brought against hin in Ireland, without having received any notice whatever ot what had taken place. Perhaps, before moving in such a question as this, the first step ought to be to consider whether a more sumniary mode of procedure than now existed could not be resorted to. As regarded England, it appeared to him that the proper principle would be to extend the provisions of the Summary Procedure Act, relating to bills of exchange, to all claims whatever fortified hbywritten obligations, or which arose out of judgment. That would be proceeding on the principle of codification; but nothing could be more inexpedient in the practice of the law than that there should be different statutory forms of procedure apphcable to different demands. With regard toXcoth p rocedure, he would say, let the Scotch lawyers find out how a foreign judgment could be most summarily enforced in their courts. As to Irish procedure, it had been so much improved of late that It was not thought necessary to introduce the summary pro. cem on bills of exchange into that country; but it would be for the Irish courts Ito consider whether they had arrived at perfection of procedure with regard to those obligations to which he had specially alluded, and if they found that the English mode was better than their own they ought to adopt it. It was not for him, however, to interfere with the reform of the Irish law. One great defect in the Bill before the House was that the summons-the inquiry which was to give effect to the judgment-was not to be in the place where thejudgusent was to be enforced, but in the place ^where it wzas to be obtained. NTow, the protection which event man ought to have required that the information enforced. (Hear.)° Mr. III'MAHON opposed the Bill as a violation of the established principles of law and jurisprudence for which there was no excuse or necessity. The great anomaly of the Bil was that it would impose upon England and Irelaud the law of Scotland, which was at variance, not only with the law of those countries, but of France, and of every other nation entitled to our respect, The proper course would be to assitailate the law of Scotland to that of Bngland ¶nea...) acialwesweebgnigtoset- h lrHear.) Scotch Iawyers were beginning to see that the mevitable result of our legislation would be to assimilate Scotch laws to that of England, as was very plainly laid down in an artiole lately pub ishe in the JournaZ of Juricprudense. That being the case, why should the hon. and learned gentleman (Mr. Craufurd) endeavour to impose on England and Ireland some of the worst features of the Scotch law? (Hear.) Few lawyers indeed, except those who hoped to be Lord-Advocates, would venture to affirm that the commercil law of Scotland was beneficial to that country, and he believed that among the people of Scotland themselves there was an almost universal reeling in favour of the introduction of English law. (A laugh.) Could anything be more preposterous than to make, as ths Bill proposed, the judgment of a Scotch court more forcible in Enrgland than the judgment of an EngliUh court would be? In Scotland, when a decreewas given in absence, 40 years was allowed to dispute it. (A laugh.) To transfer such a judgment to Ireland would be to make it irreversible. (Hear, hear.) One of the first maxims of the English law was that no man should be oondemned without being heard in his own defence, but in Scotland a dishonest creditor had no difficulty in obtaining a judgment in the absence of his debtor. Suppose an English gentleman went to Scotland, on a shooting or fishing excursion for instance, and if he only left a gun or a fishing-rod behind him to brnng him within the jurisdiction of the Court, his creditor, if ho were " furth " of Scotland, as the phrase was, had nothing whatever to do but to go to the Scotch court and obtain a judgment; and the first tbing which the creditor would Cear of the claim would be when it was put into execution on him in this country by means of the machinery of this jiilL This judgment, too, though it might easily be over. tm-red on appeal in the Scotch court, could not be touched crien 4sice it was registered in England or Ireland. Even £f t.be debtor were in Scotland all the creditor hsd to 4o saos to got him summoned at the market-crosgof Edinburgh, and, after a certain number of *' Oh yeses"l and fixing the euminmons to the o0os, the judgment could be obtained just the same. Even this ceremony, it w..s sid as often omitted, and many writs were executed without the summons ever having left the attorney's office. It vas to be hoped, therefore that before gentlemen from Scotland attempted to force tih Scotch law upon the other two kingdoms they would take the trouble to remove from it such barbarous anomalies as these. Again, supposing a bill of exchange were obtained by a Sootohman from a merchant in London fraudulently, under circumstances which would prevent it from being recovered in any other country, all the Scotch holder had to do was to get some one to order goods from the London trader, which when they were sent down to Scotland would render him liable to the jurisdiction of the Scotch courts, and immediately judgment might be obtained on his bill, which, when once registered in England, could not be set aside. But there was a still further anomaly in the Scotch practice. In the English or Irish courts, when a man got notice of an action, all he had to do was to instruct an attorney to put in an appearance; but in Scotland the agent employed was liable for aU the costs of the action, consequently no writer to the signet in Scotland would appear for a stranger until be had got security, not only forx his own costs, but for the coats of the other side aLso. Toimp'ort such extraordinary hardships as this into the English and Irish procedure would he anything hut law reform, and he hoped therefore that the Hoose would pause before it gave its sanction to this BilL. (Hear.) Mr. NEATE said the question to be decided was whether Irish and Scotch courts were to be considered as foreign courts in English courts, and vice vc-ad ; and also whether the judgments of those courts were to have no more force here than the judgments of foreign courtsi. e., to be considered as a priimd facie ground of action. Aze far as Irelandwas concerned the English and Irish forms of procedure were so much alike that the rulings of the Court of Queen's Bench in England were uoted in the Queen's Bench in Ireland, and vice ered ; and ther was no reason, therefore, why a judgment pronounced by one court should not have as much weight in either country as the judgment of the other. Thejlegal documents, too, of the two countries were so much alike that the inferior officers of the courts would have no difficulty in judging what was really a judgzmnt of the courts of the otier country. He could not allow that the Scotch code, which was thecode of tho greatest part of the civilized worid (hear), was liable to the epithets which the hon. and learned gentleman the member for Wexford had bestowed upon it. (Hear.) If the question were referred to the lawyers of Europe the chances were that it was our own code which would be pronounced barbarous and anomalous. (Hear, hear.) The objections which the hon. and learned gentleman had urged to the manner in which Scotch judgments might be made available in this country and in Izeland were more fitted for committee than for the second reading and if there were any force in them they might be easiy remedied in that stage. nMr. WHITESIDE said thatthough hehad no objection to any privatemember trying his hand at law reform, yet a of this importance ought to have been introduced by the Government. No doubt the Scotch law contained many sound principles imported from the civil law, but that part of the Scotch practice which the hon. and learned gentle. man's Bill sought to import into England and Ireland was opposed to all natural justice, and he could never consent to see it made part of the English and Irish procedure. The last time that this Bill was under the consideration of Parliament the right hon. gentleman the Attorney. General for Ireland had succeeded in introducing into it an amendment-the requiring of a copy of the judgment to be registered instead of a mere extract from it-which Che hon. and learned mover of the Bil declared to be destructive of its principle arid detrimental to its working, and yet that very provision was introduced into the Bill which the House was now asked to read a second time. The Scotch were a wary people, as Lord Brougham had once said, and when he saw the Scotch members unanimous in endeavouring to pass apiece of legislation for their own country he was generally inclined to vote with them, feeling sure that it was likely to be advan. tageous, but when they sought to import part of their legal procedure into the rest of the kingdom they must conde. seend to give valid reasons for it, and must be prepared, too, to listen to a little wholesome contradiction. (Hear, hear.) By this Bill every judgment heretofore obtained in any one of the three kingdoms might be registered and made available in the othes. A judgment, therefore, which had been obtained in Scotland might be taken at once to Dublin, and by the law of Ireland, having been registered in the Court of Common Pleas, it might be taken to another office and registered against the real estate of the debtor, and then, if it were for more than 1001., the creditor might go to the Rolls and get a receiver appointed over the landed property of the debtor before he had ever heard a word about It, and this without any redress, too; at least, the only redress a man would have would be to go to the scotch courts, where he would get it perhaps about the end of his life, or at the end of his executor's life. A laugh.) But where was the necessity of the Bill? In all hs experience he had scarely ever known a case In which a judgment obtained in this country had been made the subject of an action in the Irish courts, because, of course, a debtor, if he had no real defence to make to a judgment brought over to Ireland, did not attemnt to oppose It. No man was fool enough to dispute at the second stage that which was indisputable at the first. Neither would expense be saved by the BiLl First of all, a copy of the judgment had to be obtained, then a judge's order for proceeding to the other court with it, and then It had to be registered, the cost of all of which could not be under 51. or 6., but by a Bill which he had succeeded in passing some time ago the same rocesa might be gone through for exactly 11. 1O. The M proposed to abolish the provision by which a non-domiciled person had had to give security for costs before bringing an action, and thus to relieve a dis. honest creditor from all the diffloulty which hc at present laboured under in brilnging an acton It would open the way to aU sorts of fraudulent executions and to unjust Preferences of one creditor to another. The moment a Scotc creditor had gt a decreet register in this country, hc mit take himself off to Scotland - and if a debtor wisheo upset his judgment, he would Lave to follow him to Scotland and take his witnesses with him,-not a very economical mode of procedure. Take, too, the case of the wrong man being served with a process; there was no jurisdiction in the Bill to set aside such a mistake as that after the humbug at the market-cross of Edinburgh which the hon. and learned gentleman the member for 'Wexford haddescribed, had been gone through. As he readthe Bill all that a creditor had to do in the Scotch courts was to give some proof that his debtor had received notice of the action at some stage before judgmeat was given; he might go on with his action, and just before judgment was given might poA a letter into the post to his debtor, and that would be sn&cient notice, and he would get his judgmnnt as a matter of course. He had no objection to the existence of such a mode of procedure in Scotland. If the people of Scotland hkeda suc luxuries let them keep them, but he protested against their being introduced into the English and Irish courts. Mr. hALINS said that, though he should certainly object to the mode of procedure described by the hon. and learned member for Wexford being introduced into this country, and should certainly endeavour to alter the Bil in this respect in committee, he did not see that that was any reason for voting against the second reading of the BilL E[0 did not understand why the Bill should have been with. drawn last session in consequence of the amendment intro dued by the Attorney-General for Ireland; hut as the bon. gentleman (Mr. Craufurd) had now adopted that amendment he supposed that he must have come to the opinion which he (MTr. Malin8) always entertained, that that amend. ment did not affoct the principle of the Bill. He was disposed to agree with the hoe. and learned menmber for Innisnllen (Mr. Whiteside), that it was undesirable to abolish the giving of security for cots, bUt that was simply a matter of detail, and as he approved the principle of the Bill he should certainly vote for its second reading. The LORD-ADVOCATE said,that this was not a Scotch 3measure, nor did it owe its origin to Scotch lawyers. It was foanded upon large general principles of jurisprudence, and had the SUPPOrt Of manY lwyers who hadbeu euae according to the English system. It wha spported by the Law Amendment Society and by Lord Brougham, whose efforts in the cause of enlarged legal reform it was unnecessary for him to praise. It was no attempt to do something for the benefit of Scotland or the Scotch, for, while it enabled Scotch creditors to recover debts in England and Ireland, it gaveequalfacilities to English and Irish creditors in Scotland', and, as England was the larger and richer country, was as It were the wholesale dealer, while Scotland 'was the poorer country, it was probable that the number of debtarecoveredby English ...editorsInScotlad would largely exceed those recovered by Scotch creditors in England. Hedid not think that the principle of the Bill could he more clearly and strongly explained than it had been by the hon. and learned mnember for the city of Oxvford (Mr. Neate). Thle three kingdoms Of England, Scotland, and Ireland had three "a~rtema of jurisprudence, or at least three separate jurisdictios, nd,so ar s te dcres o thircourts were concered,stod t eah oherin he elaionof foreign countrie. Tht tis ws no ony ananomly,but a discredit to ur uripruenc, i wa nedles t prve.It appeared to hm tat te rmed forthi stte o thngsWas entirely matter f detal, thatii,,, Mi"- i.i_ -U admitted, and tbat about its second reading there could be no question whatever. The hon and learned member for Wexford (Mr. M'Mahon) had made some very strong observations in regard to the law of Scotland, He Wa glad to find that the hon. and learned member had commenced the study of that sysem, an was quite certain that a little mOre knosledge would Induce him entitely to change his opinion of it. With that view he would recommend hina instead of reading hooks about forms of proceeding, with which he was not conversant and wbich he had had no opPOrtuity of studying, to devote a little time to observing the working of the syste Scotland. He could assure himn of a hospitable receptiona in that country, and he believed that he would findI there some things which mig1ht with advantage be introdluced into the law of England. He would find in Scotland a system of land to which the division of law and equity was unknown, (Hear, hear.) He wouldi find that ecclesiastical courts had long been abolished (hear, hear) ; that land rights had been registered for many centuries; that the principle of County Courts, only the other day introduced into En land, had obtained for a long period of tuine ; and that tte 13 judges not only sat at common law, but did all the work which in England was performed by the separate Courts of Chancery, Zmiraltand Bankruptcy, and the Consistorial Courts. (Hear, hear.) The Scotch system was founded upon the civil law which obtained aU over Europe as soon as it was civilized, &nd was tranrrted directly from France into Scotland. No doubt the apse of tire and the commeroial prosperity of England had built up here a system which, although not so well founded on principle, was to a great extent Japted to the situation and wants of the country,, but he rather thought there were some motes to be taken out of that system. There were many fictions stiUl maintained in the English courts 'which maight well be abolished,' and, when the hon. and learnedgentvlemanrebferred to the Act tAW Of SCotlan, ieforottht asisiarAct was at the same ime asse to mbadthe ercantile law of EnglmI;d a upn cme gb~ets rovsioset the of England were incorporated with that of Scotlad, so upon others provisions of the Scotch laws were incorporated with that of England. That was the spirit in which last reform ought to7be pursued. It was the spirit in which thit Bill had been framed, and he did not think that the systet of either country wou'ld gain by the bandying of compli4 ments such as those in which the hon. and learned gentleC man had indulged. (Hear, hear.) Decrees made after citations, and decrees made in the absence of persons, undei the Scotch law, could nowbe enforced in the courts of Eng. Iand, and if there wore thought to be defects in the law of Scotland the proper course would be to amend that law'. One goodl effect of this Bill, if it passed, would be to call public attention in all the three kingdoms to the defects and anomalies which might exist in the legal system of any one of them. The chief defect in the law of Scotland wag the principle of foundingjurisdiction upon arrestments, and he thought that if this Bill passed it would be a good oppor'. tunity for considezng whether that mode of foundin nurisdiction should continue. The hon. and learned membr for Inniskillen (Mr. Whiteside) had referred to two or thre matters connected with the working of this measure as between England and Ireland; but these were matters of detail, and ought not, in his opinion, to prevent the Bill being read a second time. Mr. NAPIER said, that up to the time of obtaining judgment there were three separate jurisdictions for the three kingdoms, and in his opinion the pubHc interestrequire4 the maintenance of this separation of jurisdiction after judgment had been obtained. The Bill recommended by the select committee was limited to adverse judgments ; this measure, however, extended to judgments upon warrants of attorney and judgments by confession, and might, therefore, be productive of collusion or fraud.

PECHELL, who had a notice on the paper of a question on the subject of the slave trade, said that, ai there was no Cabinet Minister present, he would postpone the question to a future day. EXPENSES AT ELECTIONS. lord R. GROSVENOR, in rising to ask for leave t bringina Bill on the subject of election expenses said that he believed it would only be necessar to mak' out a prlm4 facic case for legislation in order to induce the House to agree to his motion, and he believed he should be able to do so in a few sentences. The provisions of the measure which he sought to introduce were consistent with all the legislation which had taken place on the sabject during the last 30 years. The preamble of the Reform Bill itself recited that it was necessary to take measuresm diminish the expenses of elections, and a committed which sat to inquire into the subject in the year 1834 had in their report recommended that a sufficient number of polling places should be provided at the expense of the city, county, or borough in which any election might take place, and not at that of the candidates ot of those who nominated them. That, he conceived, made out a strong case for the prov.- sion in his Bill that the expense of polingboothbs should not be borne by the candidates. The Bill contained also another provision which made the carrying of electorb to the poll illegal. It was doubtful at present whether it was or not contrary to law, and that doubt ought to be set at rest. If the House should be of opinion that there was a class of voters who ought to be carried to the poll, let them be carried at the public expense, and not at the expense of the candidates, In the last Parliament treating had been made illegal and the polling in oounties confined to oub day, and the result bad been that at the general election which had lately taken place there had been legs excitement and confusion than on any previeua occasion. If upon the second reading of the Bill the Government should announe3 their intention ef taking the subject into consideration, or considering thb measure which he had promised to introduce next year, he would not press the measure, his sole object being to save the expenditure of money in elections which might be spent much better in another way. The noble lord concluded b' moving for leave to bring in a Bil to alter the lawin reference to the payment of the conveyauce of voters to the poll, and the hustings expenses, by the candidates at elections. Mr. W. WILLIAMS did not object to the principle of the Bill, but he doubted if making the borough, city, oF county pay the expenses of the polling places would lead to economy. If that princple were adopted there would be nso prospect of there bob' any election without a conte4 and the mere expenses of the hustings formed a very imm^terial part of the excpenses of a contested election among a large constituency. Mr. DRUMMOND did not rise to object to the introduc. tion of the Bill, but merely to, say that if the noble lord meant to make carrying voters to the poU ilegal the object of the Bill was clearly to disfranchise all who were poor (hear, hear), and also to give additional preponderance to towns over counties. (Hear, hear.) If, however, there vasso strong a desire on the part of the gentlemen connected with the metropolis to make it illegal to carry voters to the pol why did they not try to carry their views into execution fefore the last election 9 (A laugh.) Why, where there was no contest, the voters of Marylebone would not come to the poll to return their favourite, Lord Ebrington, without putting him to the expense of several thousaud pounds for cabs. (Hear, hear.) If such a provision were confined to residents within counties it might not be so objectionable; but it certainly ought not to be made to apply to those who had to go from one district to another to register their votes. (Hear, hear.) As to whether this Bill would be passed as a separate measure, or whether it would form an ingredient in the reform hotch-potch of next year, he could not, of course, predicate. (Laughter.) The House then divided, and the numbers were,- For the motion ... ... ... ... 151 Against ... ... ::- ... .. 96 Majority ........-93 The motion was then agreed to, and leave given to intro duce the Bill, which was read a first time. COURT OF CHANCERY (IRELAND) BILL. Mr. WHITESIDE moved for leave to introduce a Bill to make provision for the appointment of registrars to the Masters of the Court of Chancery in Ireland; also for the safe custody of title-deeds and documentsi lodged in the said court; aud to amend its practice in certain particulars. In doing so the hon. and Icarned gentleman took occasion to state that upon the death of the late Master Henn-whose place the Government had come to the conclusion not to fll up-the three remaining Masters had in a manner which did them great credit, undertaken to clear off all the arrears in the department, provided they were supplied with a reasonable staff for the purpose. That proposal, however, had bean met upon the part of the Government by the munificent offer to afford them the services of a clerk with a salary of 1001. per annum, with the prost of having his position improved by an increase of 10 . upon his annual income. That offer the Wasters had very properly declined, inasmuch as they did not deem it desirable to alow the business to pass through the hands of the person whose services they would be likely to secure for so trifling a remuneration. They had however signified their readiness to enter upon the task of clearing off the arrears if the sum of 2001. were allowed for the payment of a proper officer. That very reasonable Proposal had not, however, received the sanetion of the Xreasury, notwithstanding the circumstance that a considerable saving in dealing with the business which had until lately been disposed of in the office of Master Henn would be the result. It was in order to provide the requisite assistance for the present Masters in the discharge of their duties that he asked for leave to introduce the present Bill as well as to promote the security of documents lodged in the Court of Chancery in Ireland. He might also add that, in accordance with the existing practice in that court, a case before it could be referred to the Mastars must be submitted to the Lord Chancellor, who had merely to nod his head like a mandarin (a laugi.), and give his assent to the proposaL That preliminary hearing it was another object of the Bil to abolsh, so that the case would in the first instauce be laid before the men who at present substantially dealt with it throughout its progress. (Hear, hear.)~~~~~~it Her Mr. J. D. FITZGERAILD said, he hoped to be able to satisfy both the hon. and learned gentleman and the House that the Bill was one which was no longer necessary, even to carry out the object which it professed to have in view. The Treasary had, as the hon. and learned gentleman had stated, offered to appoint a clerk to aid the Masters in disposing of the arrears in their department at a salary of 1N . per annum, to be increased yearly until it reached a sum of 2001. To that proposition the Masters had, in his (Mr. Fitzgerald's) opinion very pro- perly, obcted (hear, hear); and accordingly, when he had come to London to resume his place in Parliament, he had gone to the Treasury, and upon explaining the matter to the authorities there they had complied with the request of the Masters, and a minute to that effect had been issued. The Bill of the hon. and learned gentleman was, therefore, so far unnecessary, and he might add that it was the intention of the Government to erect as soon as possible a solid building for the custody of documents now lying in the Court of Chancery as well as in the common law courts in Ireland. The provision of the Bil which related to that point was one also which did not caU for the sanction of the House. He did not think those preliminary proceedings with respect to the hearig of a case before the Lord Chancellor previous to its reference to the Masters were quite so nnimportant as the hon. and learned gentleman seemed to suppose, and he might further observe that if they were unnecessary the Lord Chancellor had ample power under the provisions of an Act passed last session to dispense with them altogether. HEe should not op;cose the motion for the intoduction of the Bill, but he hoped that after the statement he had made the hon. and learned gentleman would be of op~inion that there was no occasion forproceeding6 with it. ( lear, bear.) Mr. WHITESIDE said, that he should at all events lay the Bill upon the table, as it contained three or four practical suggestions with reference to the business of the Court of Chancery in Ireland which he desired to see carried into effect. Leave was then given to bring in the Bill, which was read afirst time. GRAND JURIES (IRELAND). Leave also was, upon the motion of an hon. member, given to introduce a Bill to amend the Grand Juries (Ireland) Act, the notice of which stood upon the praner in the cnae of Captain hagan.

MEDICAL PROFESSION BIll. lMr. HEADL&KI movedforlearetobi ina billto alter and amend the laws reglating the medi profession. In doing so the hon. momber stted that its general charactsr was the same as that of the measre which he had intro. duced upon the same subject last session. Its main object was to insure uniformity of education throughout the whole kingdom in the case of medical men. It further pro. vided that persons who had passed the required exAmination in one portion of the country should possess the right to prac tise their profession in any other portion of it; and also that there should be a perfect system of registration, so that the pablic might bo enabled to aertain with as smaU an amount of trouble as possible whether any particular person wa or was not a legally qualified medical practitioner. These were the three principal provisions of the Bill, and he should only add that the machinery by which he proposed to carry them into efifct had met with the general approval of the profession. Mr. COWPER admittea that the subject of the Bill was one of groat importance, andwas gladto hear that it had met with the approbation of that profesion theintsrests of which it to so great an extent affacted.. The Stale had taken upon itself to prescribe what should be the qualifiation of medical practitioners, but the lAws by which the nature of that qalifcation was regulated were chiefly derived from old charters, and the whole subject was as a oonsequence in a somewhat auomalous condition. The qualifications required were as various as was the ares over which those qualifications could be exercised. There were, for instance, the College of Physicians snd the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, both of which held different views upon the matter. There was again the College of St. Andrew's, in which a system of a character distinct fcm the instittions which he had jnst mentioned prevailed. With reepect to the area, also, a very great anomaly exiseL The CoUlege of Physicians, for example, were enbled to give a license to practise medicine within the metropolis and for seven mles around it only, while those who obtained licenses at the univerities might practise throughout the whole kingdom. The college at Glasgow could give licenses to practise over onlz four counties, and there were 16 colleges intheuxitedaingdom thediplomas of which entitled holders by law and usage to practise only medicine. With respect to surgeons, he mibht observe that, legally speaking, there existed in their case no distinct qualification. What was. generally peaaing meant by the word "snrgeon"' ws a member of the College of Surgeons, but that was not the legal definition of the term; and it was in his opinlon extrernely desirable that the Stte, having the power to grant lienses to surgeons as wellasto physicia , shold doit effectually, and should not allow anybody to practise that profesidon without hav- ing given proof ofcompetent all in his art as well as that he hid received a fair general education. (Hear, hear.) As things at present sood, there were to be found among lieused pracStitoners men whe were incompetent, not alone so far as related to matters connected with their profession, 'but who ossessesd but a very smal acquatance with general smbjoeta The reason which wasaled by way of accounting for that fact was, that the demand for general prctitioners wao so great that, If a high standard of oompetency were fixed as necessary before tey could obtain a license, the supply would not equal to the demand, and the rural districts would to a Breat extent be deprived of the services of medical men. xperienoe, however in his opinion, tended to show that suen would not be the case, inasmuch as it was quite clear that what he might term over-competition now prevailed in the profession, as was clearly shown by the circumstance that medical men were in many instances found to be ready to take, under the Poor-law Board, salaries which the authorities themselves regaoded as being scarcely a ufficlentremuneration fortheir serviceLs With reference to the Bil before the House, he oould only say that he waa duposed to look apon it with favour, introduced as it had been under such favourable auspices, as emanating from au hon. member who bad taken great pains with the subject. (Hear, hear.) The views of th committee which had sat some time ago, and of which he (Mr. Cowper) was a member, embraced the necessity of uniformity of qualification, and of fLxinq a minimum [standard, vnthout having attained, to which no one could obtain a license to pracise. In order to come up to that standard It was neeary that a surgeon should know something of medicine and that a physician should be in some degree acquainted with surgery, while it was left to the medical co, eges to adot a higher standard in referene to the particular Imowl ge appertaining to any one branch of the profesion Thesewere the o wetg which he thought it vs desirable to cary into effect in any legislation upon the s-bject, and in so far s the Bill of his hon. friend tended to that end he should give it his cordial support. (Hear, Lord ELCHO said, It had been remarked by the late Sir R. Peel that there was scarcely a session without a Salmon Bill, and in his (Lord Elcho's) opinion the same observation might very well be applied to the Bill before the House. He, however, did not nse to offer any opposition to the Bill, but simply to put a question to his hon. friend, by the answer to which his course with respect to the subsequent progress of the measuro would be guided. Before he put the question he should say a few words in explanation of its nature His hon. friendhad introduceda bil in the penultimate session of thelast Parliament which had been committed, but which in committee had been found to require so much amendment that it had been deemed desirable to have it withdrawn forfurtherconderation. Itentirelyignoredthepositionofan M.D. of one of the Universities, and had been characterized by the hon. member for Surrey as a Bill to provide for certain bodies oo,crnta at the expense of our corporations. (A laugh.) Well, the BiU had subsequently been referred to a select committee, which had sat several wceksg and which had effected so great an alteration in the provisions of the measure that scarcely a line of the original remained. The Bil thus changed had come down from the committee, and their rxport had reeived the unanimous aseent of the House. Now, he thought the most practical step which the House oould adopt would be to take up that Bill again and to pass it into a law. The qes tion he had to akwas whet herthis B iU was o=4 fide te BiU of the ommittee? It waspossble enough that there might be a unanimons feehnamong the medical corporations in favour of this Bill, without a corresponding unanimity among the great body of the profession; and he was very much afraid that the tendency of the hon, and learned member's Bill was to benefit the corporations at the expense of the universities. Now, the medical education given in the univerdties of Scotland and in the University of London was about the best in the united kingdom, and their degrees were a far better test of a medical man's li fication than the examination before any of the cole es. The degreeof Doctor of Medicin of the University of London carried more weight with it than that of L.D. of the College of Physicians, yet an MLD. of the University of London was prohibited from practing within seven miles of the metropolis. If the Bill were bon4ujd e the Bill of the commitee ehewa readytogivethhon. andlearnmember his humble support, hut if it differed in any essential rp ect he should a sk leave of the House to lay upon the table to-morrow the Bill recommended by the committee. Mr. HBADLA. said that his B ill was not brought forward by tbe medical colleges, buto o aited with a number of medical gentlemen, having Sir C Eas at their head. These gentlemen, so far from being friendly to the colleges, were rather antagonistic to them. When the Bill was coming on the College of Physicians went to the Home Secretary and Induced him to offer objections to the Bil gong into committee. In one material point-namely, in the appointments which the Bi of the committee proposed to vest in the Government-the present Bill, he admatted, differed from that of the committe. The noble lord couldn howevemowver an amendment hentshe House went into coomnittee on the Bill Mr. NA-PIER hoped that every facility would be given to the passing of this measure It was clear that, in order to frame a good practical measure, there nmust e a good deal of concession on the part of opposing interests Ireland had long been p aryprendi ro u of her medical education, end Trinity College, Dubli, the Colleges of Physicians end Surgeons in Ixeland, and the Queen's University were agreed in favour of the ppresent measure. The Bill there. fore, had a fair chance of being acepted by the profession, and by securing a uniform system of medical education it would do much to elevate the character of the medical profession. (Hear.) After a few words from Mr. CRAuvuRDn, Mr. BLACK, as a member of the committee, said, he regretted that the measure they had recommended had not been laid on the table as the foundation of any legislation on this subject. Lord ELCHO did not suppose that the intention of the hon, and learned member had been to favour the medical corporations, although he feared hi s Bill womld have t hat effect. He should ask leave to-morrow to bring in a Bill on the subject. (sbear.) Leave was given to bring in the Bill, which was read a first time. PUBLIC PETITIONS CO OI1TE.

The A-von has experienced contimnous moderate winds and fine weather throughout the home voyage. ; The yellow fever was gradually disappearing from tha Brazilian ports. The market at Buenos Ayr for articles of daily consumption hd undergone no esential change during the month. Arrivals had been moderate, but quite equal to the demand, fully stocked as the market in general was. Holders wre firn, and prioes tolerably steady, with rather a downward tendency. A fair quantity of exports had been despatched during the mont. The saladeros had been worldng, bat on a limited scale; and, with the exceptiou of 400.or 500 barls of tallow, stocks on hand were at xero. Most other articles were in brisk demand, with an upwar d tendency in prioe, and every appearace of a limited supply. Our correspondent at Buenos Ayres, writing en the 4th of April, says,- "Contrary to all expectation, we got through the grana electoral contest of Sunday last with little blood and no loss of life. An Englishman who went to see the fun got a slight scratch from a pistol.ball in the back of his neck, but fortunately not of any consequence, and it may serve as a good lesson to others for the future. "The Government partY carried the day by a large majority, as every official influence was brought to bear on the point, and a large number of the Opposition were not permitted to record their votes. The nomination of the future Governor still remaius; ard if the views of the extreme party are carried out by the appointment of Mitre or A7sina we regard another revolts. t ron as by no means improbable.

Commercial advices from Rio are to the 13th nlt, The coffee-market had been more animated, and a further imipulse was given by the receipt of favourable advices from the United States, leading to sales of 72,000 bags between the lst and 7th of April, at a, ise of 10l0 els. Dealers subsequently demanded higher prices, which, however, occasioned buyers to withdraw, only 6,000 bags having been sold after the 7th at a fnrther advance of 100 reis. The stock on hand on the 13th was 150,000 bags. In all there had been sold froM tho 17th of- March to the 11th of April 75,000 bags for the United States, 70,000 for the Channel and North of Europe, and 17,000 for the Mediterranan. Sugar had again improved in price, chiefly Campos. Prices were quoted :-Campos, white and second, 4,600 zris to 4,900 reis per arroba; brown, 3,700 reis to 3,900 reis; Pernambuco, white, 5,200 rois to 5,o00 reis; Bahia, white, 4,300 reis to 4,600 reis; brown, 3,300 reis to 3,400 rels. About 300 hides imported from Rio Grands had sold at 400 reis, and there remainod none in stock. In exchange mnoderate amounts had passed at 27Td. and 275d., 90 days' sight.

A letter from Rio, of the 14th nlt., says:" The yellow fever is on the decline. "As to politics, the news of greatest importance is that the present Cabinet will be substittted as soon as the Chambors open, which will take place on the 3d of May next. The deputies begin to arrive from the provinces, and the first preparatory session will be held on the 15th inst. "The Government has just contracted for the importation of 50,000 emigrants with an association lately organized for that purpose, and to the creation of which Dr. Bernardo Azambuja greatly contributed. T"- principal director is the Marquis de Montealegre. "iA Frenchman belonging to a very good family in Paris has practised a fraud upon the house of Mani and Co., of the River Plate, to the extent of 40,0001. He has been detained here bythe police, and efforts are at present made to rid that estab ihment of such a loss, though it be of little importance to it." Messrs. Lallemant and Miller's Rio shipping circular of the 13th ult. has the following:-"'The ravages of the yellow fever, 'which we regret to say continue unabated, both among the shipping and on shore, have had the effect of impoding any advance in freights, which, under other circumstaunces, might with every reason have been looked for. Captains, for the protection of themselves and crows. display the utmost anxiety to leave this for other ports of greater safety, and gladlY accept any reasonable offer made for their vessels, We have only to hope that the proximate advent of winter may free us from this visitation, and then gradually bring about better prospects for the shipping interest." From the latest Bahia price current we learn that there had been no arrivals of jerked beef, prices of which wera 5,400 to 6,000 reis per arroba. In butter there were no supplies of French, but the stocks of Irish on hand were considerable; no sales ,of importance had taken place and prices ruled at from 640 reis to 700 reis. Of Dutch cheese there were no arrivals, and none in Srsf hands, so that quotations were nominal. Quotations of flour were also nominal. For sugars there had been a sudden demand; whites 'wero quoted 3,900 to 3,950 reis per arroba, and browns 3,200 to 3,300 reis; for picked whites 4,100 reis 'were obtainable. There had been no arrivals of cotton, and very little in first hands The present year's crop of coffee was nearly at an end, and very sparing supplies had come to hand. A few hundred bags of regular quality from the interior wero disposed of at 4,500 reis per arroba afloat. In landed sales were effected at 4,800. Of cocoa there had boon some unimportant sales at 5,400 to 5,500 per arrobs. Stocks of hides were beginning to accumulate, there being a less demand latterly; the last sales were at 370 reis for dry salted, and 410 'reis for dry; but quotations we-e. nominal. In exchange transactions continued at 28id. and 28d., according to the terms of payment; but, money from Pernambuco having made its appearanee in the market, it closed flat at the latter rate. Our eorresPondent at Pernambuco writes as follows on the 21st of April:- " Sugar.-The purchases have been limited throughout the month, and the stock on hand for sale is about 45,000 bags.

FOBEIGN INTBLLIGENCE. FRANCE. (FROM OUR ow0x COBrmpONnW'.T\1 Me foUowing appoaexd in our second edition of yes. ,f3ivv. -I PARI, TUESDAY, MAY 12, 6 p.m. 'If it ever was seriously contemplated by Russia Jo effect an estrangement between France and Engaand, and bring over the former to herself, the ,hanscew of success have not been increased by the ,Grand Duke's visit to Paris. Eowever appearances -nay be to the contrary, the feelings between the Mimperor and his guest are not of the warmest deacription. The Court would not grieve much if he left this very day, and, from what is currently re;ported in Russian circles, the Grand Duke is ungmrteful enough to criticize its style and tone. You may depend upon it that the detailed -account given in the Nord of the " hop,ging" and " romping" amusements the other day at, Villeneuve l'Etang was not without a pur)pose. The feeling here is pretty well known, and you can easily fancy the sneers with which that de4scription of Court recreations will have been read by the Grand Duchess, who has not accompanied Zier husband on his visit-a visit, by tbe way, which would have given her the opportunity of making the -acquaintance of the Empress Eugenie. The 'Nord it was, I believe, which remarked, the other day, that the Empress made the most particular inequiries after the Grand Duchess, insinuating thereby that a visit from her would have been desirable. On the whole, it must be admitted that the EmZperor acted very prudently in sending Prince N'apoleon out of the way. The Prince, of all otber linen, is the least likely to pass unnoticed the air of nperciliousness which thie Grand Duke is reproached with not sufficiently concealing. Had the ,Price remained a collision was apprehended, and there is reason to doubt whether, under the circummtances he would have consented to accompany the ,Grand nuke to the railroad station on his departure. Then, again, the Grand Duke thinks that the 3Emperor and Empress should have attended at the fete given by M. Haussman at the Hotel de Vile the other night; that the preparations should have been on a still grander scale, and that a greater aumber of persons should have been invited to do Limi honour. It is said to have been by superior -orders that M. Haussmaun kept the entertainment 'within the limits of -what was done for the Plenipotentiaries last year. It is a matter of doubt whether the Emperor will visit Biarritz this summer. St. Cloud, Fontaine;bleau, Compiagne, and Plombi6res will probably 'tke up the whole season. At the last-mentioned place preparations are ordered to be made for more enlarged accommodation than could be hal last year. Whether the Empress goes to Plombieres -or not is not said, but for the present, at all events, Blar-itz seems to be out of the question. Yet it would cost the Empress much to forego the pleasure e,he has in revisiting spots once so familiar to her. The Grand Duke received despatches yesterday from St. Petersburg. Among them was a letter from the C7ar to the Emperor, thanking him for his ihospitality to his brother during his stay in France. The answer of the King of Prussia to the letter of the Enperor which was made the pretext of Eending Prince Napoleon out of the way has been received. Whether HIis Prussian Majesty has improved in his French so as to come up to the stan-dard required by Dr. Kern I know not, but the sense of the missive is described by the general term " favourable." Whether it positively anmounces concessions-for, if concessions there be, from Prussia they must come-I cannot say. The Xing is said to express hia sati6faction at the schooling given by the Moniekur to the Swiss, but they, alas I have no Princes or Grand Dukes to send to -the Tuileries as visitors. The Emperor and Empress, the Grand Duke, and the suite arrived at Fontainebleau at half-past 2 yesterday. They were received by the population with every demonstration of respect. The town was handsomely decorated with flags. The number of guests invited to meet the Imperial party is said -o exceed 160. Among the amusements announced for today is a stag hunt, at which several ladies are expected to appear on horseback. A frigate and a corvette are fitting out at Cronstadt for the China Seas. It is reported that a Russian Envoy Extraordinary is to take passage in -the frigate. He is charged with a special mission to -the Emperor of the Celestial Empire. A copy of the treaty of commerce between France .,nd Russia, arranged by the Count de Moray at St. Petersburg, has arrived in Paris, and has been presented to the Emperor by Count Walewaki. When it has been examined and a pproved in Paris it vill be sent back to St. Petersburg to be converted into a definitive treaty. The French Government has made a present to the Pope of 800 rifles of the most improved model. They are intended to arm a battalion of light infantry of the Papal troop3. The Panr Ga zette of the Oth inst. announces -offlcially that the concession of a railway to connect Piacenza with the Sardinian frontier has been granted to an Italian company. The 9th anniversary of the promulgation of the constitution granted by the late Charles Albert was celebrated at Turin on the 10th inst. The following private telegraphic despatches have Jbeen received:- " BERLIN, MAY 11, EvENING. "Prince Napoleon was present this morning at a grand mnilitary review at Potsdam, after which a ddjednor was -given at the Palace of Saus-Souci. To-night the Prince -will be present at a ball at the French Embassy. Yesterday morning he attended mass, and afterwards received the -diplomatic corps. In the afternoon he proceeded to CharIottenburg, where a family dinner took place. The Queen will leave to-morrow, and Prince Napoleon the day after, gorjDresden. " MAY 12. "The Chamber'of Deputies adopted yesterday the Bill Imposing a tax on patentes (licenses to trade), with the -amendment, which re-establishes the tariffs, rejected by the Upper House."

The official Wiener Zeitung of this morning coniains the following autograph letter from His Majesty the Emperor to the Minister of Justice - " Dear Baron von Krauss,-In order to consign to eternal -oblivion the political aberrations of a sad time past, and ,more particularly the revolutionary movements which In 'I&he year 1848 were directed against the existing order of Sbings, I now, in tho way of grace, remi b all further punish- ment upon all my subjects, being civilians, who belong to those parts of my empire which do not appertain to my Lom. 1bardo-Venotian kingdom, and who have been oondemned for high treason, rebellion, or sedition (paragraphs 58, 61, 68, -end 75 of the State Laws), and are still imprisoned in this country.

"You will take appropriate measures so that this act of graco may immediately be made knovw to all those whom it may concern, and be properly carried out. "FRANCIS JOSEPH. "Buda, May 8, 1857." PRUSSIA. (FROM OUR OWN COEsPONDENiT.) BERLIN, MAY iL Yesterday being Sunday furnished very little material towards a history of Prince Napoleon's stay in this capital. It will hardly interest you to know that his Imperial Highness attended high mass at the Catholic church here, and that on entering he was received, and on leaving the edifice he was preceded to the door, by the ministering clergy bearing a cross. On his return from mass the Prince received the Corps Diplomatique,who came to pay him their respects; it was a ceremony which, like the former, his Imperial Highness did not allow to be too onerous to himself, inaamuch as none but the chefs of the different missions were admitted. The words that were addressed to each were remarkable for their paucity, if for nothing else. To this remark, however, the amnount of attention shown to our own Charge d'Affaires, Lord Loftus, and to the Russian Minister, Baron Branow, formed an exception. In the afternoon the Prince dined with the Boal family at Charlottenburg (covers having been laid for 120 guests in the so-called Golden Galery), and in the evening, after visiting the Royal Mausolem, in the Palace Gardens, returned to town and was present at the Opera. The members of the French Milssion and the military member of the Russian Embassy here were this morning honoured with invitations to dinner. The various members of the Royal Family, with the exception of the King and Queen, who had gone thither yesterday evening, proceeded at 10 o'clock with the Prince and his auite to Potsdam, where there was a review of the garrison of that place. On Friday evening, the same evening that the Prince arrived, the Minister President, Baron von Manteuffel, had an audience of him after his return from the Opera. The audience is spoken of as having been more lengthy than might have been expected, considering that the Prince had left Cologne that morning at 5 o'clock, and ever since his arrival in Berlin, at 5 o'clock p.m., had been engaged in unceasing presentations and receptions. On Saturday afternoon his Imperial Highness returned the Minister President's vist at the Hotel of FRoreign Affairs. At the gala performance of Spontini's opera of .FIer'nan CJori¶e, on Saturday evening, Prince Napoleon was seated next the King and the Queen in the Royal State box, having the Queen on his left and the Landgravine of Aesse on his right; the Royal Princes and Princesses now in Berlin, with their respective suites, forming a brilliant en sembZe. As the Royal party entered the box the overture commenced, after a preliminary flourish of trumpets. The whole house bore a mostmilitary appearance, from the circumstance of a large number of tickets having as usual been dist'ibnted to the officers who had taken part in the parade of the morning. This evening the French Minister here, the Marquis de Moustier, will give a grand ball in honour of the P'rince, for which about 400 invitations have been issued. The King, Queen, and Royal family willon this occasion honour the French Minister with their presence. It was originally fixed that Prince Napoleon should leave here again on Tuesday (to-morrow), but this has been postponed till Thursday, it having in the meantime transpired that the King of Bavaria's visit toParis wil be delayed for a day or two. The Prince is understood to have expresed a wish to visit Prince Frederick William on his way bac4 at Breslau, where the latter is in garrison with his regiment. To-morrow the Kaiser Alexander Regiment, the Dragoons of the Guard, and three batteries of the Artilery of the Guard, are to exercise on the Tempelhofer Feld outside the town and subsequently a portion of the Kaiser Franz ibegiment will practise at their targets on the Hosenhaide. Prince Napoleon, who is to be present at both, will imithis way acquire some insight into the degree of skill obtained by the Prussian artillery, and also into the excellence of the Ziindnadel rifle. In the majority of instances one hears the remark that the Prince is extremely solicitous not to offend in any way by unnecessarily calling up any of the many painful sens'ations which his presence here and his great likeness to his uncle unavoidably suggest. His bearing towards the Royal family appears to be dictated by a sincere desire to please, and to remove anythig like bitterness that may cling here to all connected with the name of Napoleon. On the other hand, towards persons of less distingJushed position the Prince shows himself less careful to avoid giving offence, as in the case of his reception of General Wrangel on Saturday morning before the parade. The old Field-Marshal had been absent from Berlin on duty, atnd had thus been prevented from being present with the other generals when his Imperial Highness was received at the railway station. He accordingly presented himself before the parade to pay his respects and excuse himself for his absence. On the Field-Marshal's entrance the Prince pointed to an empty chair near him, and motioned his Adjutant to another among the Adjutants, but to all the old man's civil speeches and protestations he answered not a single syllable, and allowed him subsequently to execute his apologetic retreat to the door without permitting a sound to pass his lips. It is, however, just possible that this may be meant as a return for General Wrangel's uncalled-for presence at the Te Deum celebrated in the chapel of the Russian Embassy for the capture of KU-s, at a time when France and Russia were not such good friends as now. I cannot ascertain that the Prince has auy "mission" here beyond returning Prince Frederick William'a visit of last year; the Emperor Louis Napoleon's visit to Prussia, which has for a long time past been more or less on the fapis, and is at present talked of as to take place in the autumn (for the purpose of his being present at the Kinwigs snannvre of the 6th Army Corps in the province of Saxony), is just as much an open question as ever. SPAIN. (FROM OUR OWN CO:RRESONDIM-T.) MADRID, MAY 8. An unpleasant occurrence at Malaga has given rise to an exchange of notes between Lord Howden and the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs. On the 19th of April last five petty officers, belonging to Her Britannic Majesty's war-steamer Curlew, were on shore on leave in Malaga. They had taken, according to their own admission, two or three glasses oX wine apiece, and some, or all of them, may possiblyhave been slightly intoxicated, but certainly not what is usually called disgracefuUy drunk While passing through a street of Malaga two of them began skylarking, one seizing the othees Guernsey frock behind, and drawing it over his companion's head. A Guarduo Civl or Gendarme, whowitnessed this, appears to have thought that they were quarrelling, and that it was incumbent upon him to interfere, although vhat was going on was nothing more than the horseplay habitual to Jack ashore, and which is daily witnessed and nowise heeded in our English seaport towns. The Gendarme's mode of interference was of the roughest; without word or warning he struck a sailor two blows on the back of the neck with the barrel of his musket. He was about 'to strike a third time more violently, when another sailor stepped forward to ward off the blow from his messmate. The Gendarme pressed onward, and it is presumable they closed, for the sailor was thrown upon his back, and his opponent fell upon him. Two Spanish soldiers came up to assist their countryman, end one of them, au artilleryman, beat a salor with the flat of his short herj,v sword. To cvit the story short, three or, te sailors wrex- arrested (without restanoe, ana without having struck a blow); the other two, who -were walking on in front and bad taaen no part in the scuffle, were pursued, and Ialso unrettingly made prisoners. The square| Oaded knivea which they wore, sailor fashion, nliqeu(A byd&p t& their xxeclu~ were cut off and taken from themn. This waa on a Saturday. tPhey were couveyed to the lock-up, and kept there until Monday afternoon, when they were transferred to the common gaol, and lodged with robbers and murderers. F'rom the time of their arrest until the Tuesday morning no food was given to them. By that time the English Consul, Mr. Mark, was informed of their imprisonment, and supplied them with necessaries. Foreigners enjoying the fuaero miiitar in this country, the Captain-General, as the chief military authority, took up the case and referred it to the Tribunal of War and Marine. The British Minister at Madrid, informed of these facts by the Consul at Malaga, placed them in their true light before Senor Pidal, representing to him that the offence of the sailors, who had in no way aggressed or resisted the authorities, was of a venial nature; that it had already been punished by 48 hours' privation of food and a fortnight's im-prisonment, and that he trusted the matter would not be proceeded with, but that the men would be restored to their captain, to receive such further punishment as they might be considered to deserve. Senor Pidal replied that a communication had been made to the Captain-General of Malaga, directing him to treat the matter with the indulgence due to the circumstances of the case and to the subjects of a friendly and allied Power. Other notes have passed, but all much in the same sense, Ijord Howden inssting, more and more forcibly, on the facts of the case and the propriety of relei the prisoners, and the Spanish Minister doing little more than repeating in substance his first note, with aEsurances that thematter should be inquired into. The expeditious forms of English criminal law and police-courts would render it impossible for a trivial affair of this kind, occurring in England, to give rise to diplomatic communications. Had five Spanish sailors been brought up at Plymouth or the Thames Police-court on such a paltry charge as this they would a3suredly have been released at once, or, at most, have been sent on board the man-of-war to which they belonged, with a complaint to their captain. Unfortunately, in this country things are very differently conducted. Here have been these five poor fellows, for an offence which can hardly be called one, shut up since the 19th of last month in a Spanish gaol. Itis necesaryto know what a Spanish gaol is to appreciate the extent of this -nmerited punishment. But the worst part of the case is, that if the matter be left for the decision of the Tribunal of War and Marine, to which it has been referred, the men may, and probably will, be in prison for weeks or months longer; for, although the Spanish military tribunals are more expeditious than their civil o3ies, their pace Is terribly slow, and their action impeded by endless forms. The just and common-sense course to adopt is, as it is to be hoped the Spanish Government will see, to send the men at once on board their ship, sending with them a statement of the charges against them. Empty forms should not be allowed to impede the decision in a case so clear as this, for, if they are, justice is sacrificed to them. The men are not aceused of having assaulted or resisted the authorities; they did not strike a single blow, and the utmost alleged against them is, that they were tipsy and squabbling; although what the grave Castilian Gendarme took for squabbling was, in fact, mere play. It would not be surprising if an attempt were made to represent them as armed with knives, and perhaps as disposed to use them. it is pretty well known how unfitted an English sailor's knife is for a weapon of offence, and how foreign it is to his character to use it as such. But in Malaga, notorious in Spain and elsewhere for its disreputable and cutthroat population, a scuffle can hardly be imagned without a stab. It is only about a year and a half ago that an English sailor named I Butting was cruelly stabbed and killed in open day I in the streets of Malaga by a Spaniard, whom he had never seen or spoken to. The murderer had had a quarrel with some American seamen, and had vowed that he would stab the first Englishman he met-he not knowing the distinction between English and Americans. He met poor Hutting and killed him on the spot, in presence of a number of persons, including many National Gua, who favoured his escape. The representations of the British Minister at Madrid were long fruitless; it is sad that the assassin himself was a National Guard, and at any rate Esparteroes Government was too feeble and supine to risk offending the turbulent Malaguenos. At last the man was arrested, and is now in prison, but it appears impossible to get him punished as he deserves, although repeated applica.. tions have been made to the Spanish Government, and it is far from lmprobable that one of these days it willbe found that he has escaped, or, in other words, that he has been released On learning the imprisonment of his men, the captain of the Curlew made verbal representations to the Captain-General, but without effect. A day or two afterwards an incident occurred which caused much excitement in Malaga. Three English men-of-war put in there, in consequence of a severe gale. With that pecular illogicalness which is a characteristic of the Spanish mind-by nature suspicious and susceptible-the people of Malaga jumped to the conclusion that these ships had come in consequence of the afair of the Curlew's sailors. It would still probably be impossible to persuade them that the idea was simply absurd, and that no species of submnarie telegraph has as yet been devised by which the vessels could have been informed, while saiEng over the Mediterranean, of what had occurred at Malaga. The arrival was a pure coincidence. The captains went, as is customary, to pay their respects to the Captain-General, and, having learnt what had happened, made suitable and strong representations to him; but these had no greater effect than those of the captain of the Curlew. Shortly afterwards the three vessels left. There have been reports this last day or two of the intended removal of General Jo0e Concha from the command of Cuba, but they obtained little credit, as his term of service expires in October, until when it was thought he would be allowed to remain. Information, however, has just reached me, from a highly trustworthy source, that his recaU has been decided on in a Council of Ministers, and that he is to be replaced by General Lersundi, at present Minister of Marine. The name of the person who is to r eplace Lersundi is matter of conlecture, but the post will very probably be offered to Don Luis Gonzales Bravo. It would not be surprising if there were one or two other changes in the Cabinet; at least, it is generally thought that General Figueiras will not long remain in the War Department, a post he fills but very poorly. I am not yet acquainted with all the reasons for Concha's recall, but the recent scandalous extension of the slave trade in Cuba is believed to be one of them. On this subject, as I before informed you, Lord Howdenhas lately had occasion to address frequent complaints to the Spanish Government. General Concha has, of course, followiDg the example of most of his predecessors, taken a percentage on the profits of this illegal and infamous traffic. He is said to have made the moderate sum of 1,000,000 dollars, on which, even if he receive no other appointment, he will be able to exist tolerably on his return to Europe.

MONA Y-MARBMr and oxiTy12JTELLIQ&jN. Wednesday Evening. The funds continue buoyant, and have experienced a further advance of a quarter per cent. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 93 to J, were first quoted 93i to 94, whence they went to 94k. The execution of several limits for sales at 94 then caused a reaction to 93k, but the last official transactions were at 94 to J for money, and 94i to i for the 4th of June. The savings-bank purchases of Exchequer-bills are still going On at the rate of: about 80,0001. a-day, and the market is well sup-, plied with money, the general rate in the afternoon being about G per cent. Alarge purchase of Turkish Six per Cents, also afforded indirect support. Bank Stook left off at 211 to 213; Reducedc 92' to ; ; New Three per Cents., 92i to J; India Stock, 220 to 222; India Bonds, 8s. to 3s. discount; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to {; and Exchequer-bills! (June) Is, discount to Is. premium, (March) is. to 4s. premium. Iu the discount-market, and at the Bank to-day there was ag,ain a full demand, but no actual pressure. Foreign securities generally have improved, and Turkish and Russian were freely purchased at an advance of from a-half to one per cent. In Turkish Six per Cents. the transactions for money were at 93 i-, 944, and I; and for the account, at 94i, i, ani, W. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were negotiated for money at 100, i, and ;, and for the account at 100I and 101. The other business comprised :-Mexican Three per Cents., 23; Russian Five per Cents., 105k and 106; The Four-anda-Half per Cents., 9SE, 97, and§; Spanish Bew Deferredl, 250; Spanish Certificates, 6i and i-; and Dutch Four per Cents. Certificates, 97g. The corn-mnarket was dull this morning at the reduced rates of Monday. The final prices of the French Three per Cerits. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 35c. for money and 69f. 55c. for the end of the month showing a fractional decline. A furtber sum of about 15,0001. in gold was sold to the Bank to-day. The prospectus has been issued of the Mediter.- ranean Extension Telegraph, with a capital of 120,0001., in 101. shares, and a guarantee from the English Government of 6 per cent. for 25 years. The object is to carry the line, which has already been laid to Sardinia, to Malta and Corfu, where a communication will ultimately be effected with the Euphrates line to India. Its length will be about 700 nautical miles, and a contract has beer made for its completion by October next, the manufacturers taking aU the risk of laying it down. From the number of vessels touching at Malti a large revenue is especially contemplated from that port. The tariff rates will be fixed with the consent of the Government, and are not to be liable to re duction, except when the profits of the company shall exceed 12 per cent. M-. Samuel Gurney is the chairman, Messrs. Hankey are the bankers, and Messr. Mullens, Marshall, and Daniell the brokers. The new eommittee on the Bank Charter Act will forthwith commence its sittings. It is composed of 25 members, comprising the Cbancellor' of the Exchequer and four ex-Chancellors-namely, Mr. Disraeli, Sir Francis Baring, Sir C. Wood, and Mr. Gladstone; also, Sir J.

The suspension ha3 been announced of MIessrs. Barker and Co., timber and stave merchants of Southwarkr. The liabilities are supposed to range between 60,0001. and 100,0001., and it is feared tho liquidation will be rather unfavourable. The smelters have given notice of a reduction of 31. per ton on communon tin and 41. on refined ThMe HIotapur, from Ciicutta, has arrived off Portsmouth having left the Cape of Good Hope on the 17th of ifarch. Te advices from the Cape will be four days later than those previously received. The African steamer Ethiope has arrived with 3,000 oza. of gold, valued at 12,0001. The City of Washington, from New Yorks brings 14,0001., and the Avon, from Brazil, 1,0001. The advices by the Avon to-day state that a contagious fever has been severely prevalent at Montevideo. The following letter, dated the 5th of April, gives the latest particulars !- " In my last I mentioned that the Prinee had threo case of yellow fever on board, one of which proved fataL She had no sooner left than the public became suddenly aware that fever had broken out in this town; and from the unfounded insinuations of the Government and the medical board it was beheved that the passengers of the Prince had brought it on shore. This, however, is not the fact, as I know several cases ocourred before her arrival; and there can be no reasonable doubt that the cause arose from the filthy state of that section of the town where it first made its ap rance. For some yearspast it has been the Custoln forthe dirt carts, which daily collect from the different houses, to cast it into hollow places, in order to produce a level, and these low places are near the bay. The large accumulation of annimal and vegetable matter has yearly produced fever at the end of the summer, but not of so serious a character as to attract public attention. But this season the weather has been unusually hot, and the north winds, which are the most unhealthy, have prevailed in a greater degree. There has been almost a total absence of the salubrious south-west or psmpero breezes. Many have died, mostly poor people, crowded unwhole. somney in small dwellings or residing in wooden honses. The fever has Spread all along the border of the bay, and is now in most parts of the town, where, however, in tho higher parts it assumes a milder form. The inhabitants have become alarmed, and thousands have left tho city. Tha doctors are not agreed as to the name of the fever, some calling it yellow, and others gastric. It would be impossiblo to say how many people have died, for the most contradictory accounts are current, and, as in periods of Ignorance and alarm dangers are magnified, it is probable the number has been really less than reported. Most of the burials take place in the night The polieo are having the filth carted away and the wooden houses burnt, and the town generaUy is being cleaned. I must again advert to the desirableness of Maldonacjo as the principal port for the Royal Mail Steam CompanVs ships, I aud I think the directors should seriously consider the subject. The town bearing that name, about two miles from the bay, is at present a miserable place, but the land being fertile, Tegetables and fruit could soon be produced in abundance. The island of Goritti, which shelters the anchorage, would make a capital coal station, aud stores might be erected for goods, besides which there is room for hotels or lodging-houses. Evi- dence of its capabilities can easily be obtained in' England from Admirals Parvis, Sartorius, Captains Fitzroy, Sulivan, and other naval officers. With good ships the voyage, including the usual stoppages and 48 houra at Rio, sbould be made on an average - 30 days. The distance to Montevideo is between 70 and 80 miles. The detentions which of late have been so frequent would be avoided, as well as the risls from fever. In a very short time at least double the number of passengers that go from this river might be with certainty calculated upon, and the small steamers kept in the river might in the intervals ran be. I tween Montevideo and Buenos Ayres very profitably. Of | politics .1 have nothing to communicate on this occaou. The fever absorbs every thought, and iI the sole topic of conversation. Three or four of our oountrymen have fallen victims to it. Among them are Mr. and Mrs. MIlburn and their youngest daugster, and Mr. Loekwood; the latter was the manaing parner in the spect able and long-established house o Bodyor Brethers, ad Co., and muc respected as one of 1the most ionourable of our countrymen in the River Plate. Mr Mlbura was an engineer long resident in this country. His los will be sev erely felt, as he wras the only goad working engineer inI MIontevideo. These last twvo or three days of cold wfeather, it is hoped, will stop the progress of the fevar. "The elections at Buenos Ayres passed off wiiout a.ny serous consequences; they were almost uniformly in favour of the existing state of things. The violence of the Refosna, a paper representing the Rosisa party, is worthy of.tbe days of Eosas. The Governor apprti=tbe various cdLbs or election committees that the soldiey should be oonfined to their barcks during the electiomg. Tne Indians have i¢dn committed depredations, and it is strongly suspected tley were incited by the Rosistas. It is said there are feaw casesof fever In Buenos Anres.

ZONDON, THURSDAY, AAY 14 1857. 1 -~~~~~ Ia the Hoi[o of Commons yesterday, Mr. CRAUFUnP, in moving the second reading of {he Judgments Execution, &c., Bill, which had been repeatedly introduced and discussed in the last Parliaaaent, explained its object,-namely, to remove an anomaly in our -law procedure, by making a ludgment obtained in any court of competent jurisdic. tion in the United Kingdom available for execution by simple registry and notification, without action, in any other sach court in England, Scotland, or 3[reland. Colonel FBxoH opposed the Bill, which, he con%ended, would afford facilties to fraudulent creditors, and he moved to defer the second reading for aix months. Thias mendment was seconded by Mr. BLAND, who argued that, although the Bill on the face of it profeased to give a reciprocity, the balance in reality was against Ireland, and that the Irish com3nunity; especially the commercial part of it, would be sufferers by this change of the law. Mr. AThTON opDosed the measure, which he considered to be no real law reform, but a proceeding in a wrong direction, since the object could be better athtained by an extension of summary process. Mr. T~PM>Ma3oN likewise condenined the Bill, which, he said, would import into our debtor law the u"justifiable anomalies of the " barbarous code" of Scotland. Mr. NEATE supported the second reading of the Bill, which was strongly resisted by Mr. WInTESIDE, who pointed out In detail what lhe considered would be the oppressive effects of this experiment in the change of process in Ireland. Mr. MALINs thought that, though the clauses relating to judgments and decreets in Scotland, which he desired to see expunged, were objectionable, this was no reason for rejecting the BilL The law of England and Ireland being identical a judgment obtained in England should be conclusive in Ireland. The LORD-AD voATE observed that this was not a Scotch measure, but was foumded upon large and general principles of jurisprudence, and the question was whether the principle of the Bill, which got rid of an anomaly that was a discredit to our law, was right. If the Scotch law of judgments was bad, let it be amended. Mr. NAPIER said, his main objection to the Bil was that, whereas up to judgment there would be three separate jurisdictions, it was after judgment that the public had the greatest interest in maintaining the separation. The Bill, he believed, would be injurioas to commerce and productive of collusion and fraud. MIr. HADFILD and MIr. STEuART spoke in favour of the Bill. Upon a division the second reading was canried by 137 to 99. The report ofthe Committeeof Supply was brought up and agreed to. Lord R. Grosviopi moved for leave to bring in a Bill to alter the law in reference to the payment of the conveyance of voters to the poll and the hustings' expenses by the candidates at elections, observing that his proposition wras baseed upon a recommendation of a committee of the House in 1834, and was consistent with the spirit of our legislation for the last 30 years. After a few words from Mr. W. WnLrfls and Mr. DRTrL-OND the House divided upon the motion, which was carried by I 51 to 58. Mr. WrIrEsImE moved for leave to introduce a Bill to make provision for the appointment of Registrars to the Masters of the Court of Chancery in Ireland; also for the safe custody of title-deeds and documents lodged in the said court; and to amend the practice. He entered into various details to show the necessity and the object of the BilL Mr. J. D. FITZGBRALD, after giving certain explanations, said, he did not object to the Bill being laid upon the table. leave was then given. Captain MAGAw obtained leave to bring in a Bill to amend the Grand Juries (Ireland) Act, 1836. Mr. BHADLss moved for leave to introduce a Bill to alter and amend the laws regulating the medical profession, the object and provisions of which he briefly explained, the Bil being in its main provisions the same as that which had been before the last Parliament Mr. COWPEB observed that, the whole subject being in the greatest confusion and in the most anomalous condition, a great number of licensing bodies competing together, and incompetent persons gaining admission into the profession, legislation was called for, and he thought no one would oppose the reintroduction of this Bill. Lord ELcHo did not oppose the motion, but thought it would be a more practical proceeding to take up the Bill of the last Parliament as amended in the select committee. If this were not done, he shouild move for leave to reintroduce his bill of the last session, which protected the interests of the Universities. Mr. HxaDLrA.3 said, the BiU guarded the rights and interests of all bodies connected with the medical profession as well as the interests of the public at large. Mr. NAPn= and Mr. CRAuYmRD made some general observations upon the subject of medical education, and, after a few words from Mr. BLAcK, leave was given to bring in the BiL The remaining business having been disposed of, the House adjourned shortly before 5 o'elock.
No reflections are more obvious than those in which the greatness of effects is contrasted with the smallness of the causes leading to them, but it seems as if an extraordinary illustration even of this familiar doctrine would be exhibited in the Chinese waters during the present twelvemonth. Last October Mr. Commissioner YnR thought fit to apprehend on board the Arrow a wretched Chinaman whose son or father was alleged to be a pirate, and to refuse the redress which this offence required. It is not improbable that next October may witness, as the consequence of this trespass on the deck of a lorcha, an assemblage of the fleets of half Europe off the coasts of China. A British squadron is already there, and a second on its way. An American squadron is to be despatched forthwith, and a French squadron is on the point of departure for the same destination. All this, perhaps; is natural, but this is not al. Spain is about to revindicate its interests in " the Indies," and the ancient flag of Castile and Leon will again be conspicuous in the Far East. Austria is to send ships to China, Sardinia is to do the same, and it is not impossible that other Italian ports may despatch their quotas on this allattractive expedition. Such a gathering of European keels will hardly have been seen since the days when the galleys of Genoa and Venice carried the chivalry of Christendom to the liberation of Palestine. However, the object is not a holy war this time. The war, if fighting must needs ensue, will be just and wiU be unavoidable, but for that matter we alone are the actual belligerents, and we could certainly manage the contest by ourselves. Why, then, are the eagles gathered together ?-Upon the scent which usually collects them, no doubt. The attracting carcass is a huge overpopulated empire-not, perhaps, effete, not decaying, not tumbling to pieces, not exposed in the ordinary helplessness of a prey, but still presenting irresistible allurements to the keen-eyed Cabinets of the Old and New World. The simple matter is, that a country large enough to constitute a considerable section of the whole globe is not unlikely to be brought into the community of Christian nations for the first time. As it happens, the country in question possesses also the monopoly of a produce so sought after as to be a0l but a necessary of life, and it is rich besides in those treasures of silk indispensable to the markets of the West. It is not, however, in this mere productiveness that the attraction resides. The laws of supply and demand may always be relied upon to insure cargoes of Chinese commodities; nor is it to be anticipated that we shall get tea in much greater quantities or at a much cheaper price after this business is settled than we did before. Neither can we assume that the expectations of reciprocity in commerce are exerting any very powerful influence. We ourselves, of course, being such very large consumers of Chinese produce, and such very large manufacturers on our own. behalf, may naturally wish that Chinamen would deal with us as we deal with them, and not balance the transaction so interminably in silver alone; but Spain and Sardinia can have no eager anxieties in this way; and, even if they had, it is doubtful whether the pasture is very promising for any of us. The Chinese Empire is so large, its productions are so various, and habits of self-sufficiency in these respects have been inculcated upon Chinamen for so many generations, that it would be unsafe to reckon upon any immediate diffusion of European goods through the interior of the country, even after all the facilities which we may obtain. Where, then, must we look for the attraction which appears to be so universally felt ? Probably in the simple fact that an enormous empire is about to be introduced to the world. Hitherto China hars avoided the intercommunion of society-has received niobody,'and has visited nobody. The barriers are now likely to be removed, and one State would like admission to the mysterious region as well as another. Such an event as this gives the only chance now remaining of entirely new dealings, alliances, or connexions. There are no fresh worlds to be discovered; we have been round and round the globe, and have even found the North-west Passage. If anything new is to be done it must be in some country long known but hitherto inaccessible, and such a country is China. Japan is a sealed land certainly, but Japan is a mere speck on the map compared with the mighty empire of the Chinese. Here we believe is the true secret of the gathering. Governments do not, perhaps, expect much; we do not expect much ourselves, but none like to lose an introduction which may convey nobody knows what, and which is a11 the more enticing from its very mystery. Every State wishes to be on a footing with the most favoured State in its reception at a perfectly new place. Very likely there won't be much divisible, but nobody desires to miss a dividend for want of registering a claim. Commercial profit, political " influence," colonial position-fifty things besides, are floating about as possibly contingent on a good connexion with China, and even where none of these are regarded there is the stimulus of fashion and example. Where half the world is going nobody likes to be behind. And who, then, is to be the master of the ceremonies at this strange specimen of a Congress ? In old days the Pora would have partitioned China, as he. did the globe, and assigned the imaginary benefits of its provinces by equitable distribution among the Crowns of Christendom. As there is no longer such an arbiter we must each deal for ourselves, and we can do so, we trust, without any conflict of interests whatever. Our own interests are certainly not such as to clash with those of any other Government. On the contrary, they coincide, in the first instance, with the chief interests of all. We demand security for Europeans, freedom from insult, freedom from abasement, freedom from danger. We desire to terminate once and for all the expression, if not the existence, of that feeling by which a semibarbarous people, whose lives by their own valua. tion are as cheap as those of dogs, presume upon a superiority in the scale of creation over the most civilized communities in the world. As our trade with the Chinese is enormous, and as we cannot diFl,ense with some establishments in those parts, we ask for such reasonable freedom of settlement and range as health requires, and for the power of taking a few hours' exercise without being stoned. As we know perfectly well that Chinamen, as a nation, are not troubled with any actual sentiments of intolerance or unsociability, but are ready to take service and lodgings at any place between Singapore and St. Mary-axe, we require that they shall give as well as take, and behave as freely at home as they do abroad. Here ends the principle of our demands. As to the immediate conditions of commerce, they must take their chance, nor is a word necessary on this score, although such a trade as the Chinese have lately driven with us is almost without a parallel under the sun. If the " balance " of trade" is to be computed by the amount passing n money from one side to the other after the industrial productions of each have been interchanged, what is to be thought of the bargain of JomT Cii&W, who takee the whole value out in silver, and after selling miUions' upon millions' worth will buy nothing at all ? This, however, is at his own discretion; we only ask him to do what he is profoundly anxious to do-viz., supply us with tea, and not visit us with degradation and injury while we are maldng our purchases. If other nations wish for like facilities the course is open to them. We can have no possible jealousy in this respect. We want to light our own taper at the Chinese candle, but others can do* the same without putting us in a bit worse position, or the Chinese either. We trust, indeed, that the results may be as much for their advantage as for ours. There is very little room left for supposing that the Chinese have any great step now to take in entering upon more liberal communications with the world. We have good grounds for believing that their character is in a Phase of transition. Their enterprise, as shown In the goldfields and the Straits of Malacca, their ambition, as evinced at Sarawak, and the fermentation of the whole national mind, as exemplified in the tenacity and scope of their rebellion, are conelusive proofs against anything like a cherished system of isolation or seclusion. They have grown too big for their own country, like young birds for their nest; they are fain to come out into the world for their advancement, and they have turned things upside down at home. Their policy, in fact, is at an end. It has endured a long while, but it has failed at last. China must come out of ita shell, for its own sake; and when so many millions of human beings throw their lot in with the rest of mankind it is hard if the reult should not be for the benefit of alL
The county of Mayo and the borough of Sligo bid fair to be the two most sporting cases of the election battue now at hand. Both the county and the borough are old notabilities. Were it not for Sligo, Mayo would be the chief offender; but for Mlayo, Sligo would be the brightest gem in the electoral coronet of the sister isle. Mr. GEORGE Hxxmy MOORE, the representative for Mayo, and Mr. PATRICx Soyns, the member for Sligo, are not without a certain reputation in the committeeroomS of the Eouse of Commons. They are well-trained champions, grim and grisly with the scare of many a fight. Whatever be the result of the petitions-we abstain from any expression which might imply an ill omen,-the men, when fairly driven to bay, wiU surely show sport. The incidents of an election contest in the committeerooms when the representation of an Irish constituency is the prize are always sufficiently stirring. " About this time hard swearing "may be expected. Sow kidneybeans for succes"sion, and let blood." Such is the appropriate rubric for the time in the Electoral Almauack. Among the many strange things in this strange world it is much to be doubted if ever there was anything more anomalous than the position of an elector throughout a large portion of Ireland but 30 or 40 years ago. Consider that the manufacture of lawss for the guidance and regulation of a great empire was the ultimate end of the gyrations and brawls of that frantic savage whom you might see drunk with his party's whisky and his own emotions, breaking the heads of his unkempt fellows. We are not, of course, spealdng of Le land as it is, but of Ireland as it was,when, between landlord and priest, the voters were driven to the polling-booths like herds of pigs to market, when Castle Squander was in its prime, and when Irish country gentlemen used to travel about the country in hearses, to avoid the service of a legal proes. We have had our own sins to answer for on this side of St. George's Channel-we acknowledge them freely-but it was always a question of degree and picturesqueness between ourselves and our Irish feUow-voters. Even at the present day our electoral shield is not immaculate. We think of Cambridge and of Kidderminster, and we feel that we cannot with consciences perfectly clear twit our neighbours with acts of corruption and violence. But in England, as far as we are aware, the voter is not exposed to every kind of influence which may 7itiate an election at one and the same time; he is not bribed, beaten, treated, imprisoned, his soui is not consigned to eternal perdition, he is not ruined in his trade, and kicked off an estate al at once. Now, if we are to judge from the language employed in the petitions which have just been presented against the validity of the returns of Messrs. 3MoonE and Soans, lrish electors in certain chosen spots,-among others, in the county of Mfayo and the borough of Sligo,-are as exposed as ever to the compound action of all influences which may cajole, cheat, or terrify them into an unfair exercise of that which with bitter irony is called their " electoral privilege." The county in entitled to the precedence, and so we will firat say a word or two about the charges preferred by Colonel GonE HiuGws against M£r. GEORGE lOORE for his conduct throughout the late election. He charges Mr. MooRE with organizing a concerted system of violence, intimidation, and riot, in order to terrify all the voters who might be inclined to record their votes against him. Thus far there is only question of appeals to the external portion of the skull, and the outer man generally, by means of brickbats, clubs, bludgeons, fists, &c.; but the electoral surgery did not stop here. It appears, according to Colonel HEGGes's statement, that both before and during the election the Roman Catholic clergy convened large meetings in various parts of the county, and at their chapels denounced him by name. " They "made (their hearers) believe that the electors at "the said election and others would be advancing "the glory of GoD and saving their souls from "eternal damnation, and bringing blessings "on their families, by voting for the said "GEORGE HENRY MOORE; + % * and they "openly invoked the curse of the AmuGrETY " upon all who should xefuse to voto for the "said GEORGE HENRY MOORE, and stated that "the souls of those who declined to vote for the "said GEORGE HENRY MooRE would be con"signed to eternal perdition." At this point we may well pause to take breath. Of all kinds of intimidation this spiritual intimidation is the worst, and, if proved before an Election Committee, it should at once be held sufficient to unseat the member. This is not the first time that the abuse of spiritual influence has been charged against the county of Mayo. The Election Committee which sat in 1853 reported that from evidence given before them they had come to the conelusion " that there was great abuse of "spiritual influence on the part of a great "body of the Roman Catholic priesthood during "the last election for the county of Mayo." A similar report was made by the Sligo Committee in the same year. We are not without hope that, under the comprehensive provisions of the recent Act, an effectual stop may be put to this most abominable species of electoral corruption. To proceed with the charges brought against Mr. G. H. MoonE by Colonel Hicniws. He and his priestly coadjutors are charged with having made various actual onslaughts on the canvassers of the HIGGIns party, and with having fairly driven them off the field. Then priests were set to act as tally-agents for Mr. MooBB; they caught the HIGGINS' VoterS in the niok of time, and compelled them to vote the other way. Then on the polling-days Roman Catholic priests crowded the avenues to the polling-booths at the head of mobs armed with sticks, stones, and bludgeons, and either frightened away as many of the electors as had come to vote for Colonel HIGGoSu, or by actual violence compelled them to record their votes for Mr. MOORE. Then there was treating, there was bribery, there was personation, there was voting by persons not duly qualified, and, as a crown to the whole, "the said GEORGE ENRY Moons was not at the "time of the said election, and is not, duly quali"filed by seisin or possession of real or personal "estate or effects of such a nature, or to such "an amount, as was and is by law necessary to "qualify him to sit and to be elected." Are we not right in saying that never was there such an electoral patient as this poor county of Mayo ! We scarcely know of a taint or sore, of a disease or fracture, with which it is not afflicted. All the faults which can vitiate an election may be profoundly studied in this single case. Mr. Wy?Nz has been doing the same good office by Mr. P?TEmx So=Rs as Colonel EHmGGs by Mr. G. H. Moons. In the case of the borough of Sligo it is charged that various votes were recorded for Mr. SormuRs by persons who were not legally entitled to vote; that there was personation in favour of Mr. SoaRzs ; that good votes tendered on behalf of Mr. WYniZ were improperly rejected, or rather not entered on the poll-books, by the returuing officer and his deputies; that the returning officer and his deputies actually carried to Mr. SOMEes'S account votes which were tendered on behalf of Mr. WYNNE; that certain electors did not vote at all, but that yet their votes were entered for Mr. SoMRs ; that violence, threats, and intimidation of every kind were exercised before and during the election by the friends and agents of Mr. SONEs ; that some of Mr. WymN&s voters were actually carried away by force, and that others were hindered from recording their votes ; that some of Mr. WNNEs votes were rejected by the returning officer and his agents on the frivolous pretext that the voters were drunk at the time, and not in a condition to exercise the franchise; and that other smiar votes were rejected on the ground that they had been expunged from the hsts by the barrister, when, in point of fact, they had not been so expunged. We need not, however, follow the allegations of the petition throughout ;-what remain are of the same character. Enough has been said to show what our readers may expect from the reports of the proceedings before the Election Committees for the county of Mfayo and the borough of Sligo. Other constituencies may perhaps hope to equal-none to surpass them. In the case of English boroughs and English counties we may perhaps hear of disappointed members and lost seats because of treating, or because of bribery, or because of intimidation-because of the reception of imDroper votes, or because of irregularities of other kinds; but we cannot anticipate any such evidence of varied and compound wickedness as will pro- bably be proved in the cases of the county of Mayo and the borough of Sligo.
Legislation appears to be as difficult in the Oxford parliament as it is in the Imperial one. This local legislature has, indeed, but one subject to talk about, but that subject is a pre-eminently stiff one, and moreover it happens to be a subject upon which everybody has sometbing to say. If there is hardly an individual even in the vulgar world who does not think he knows something about education, it must be expected that the sanetuary and seat of education should be prolific of opinions on that subject. Where everybody is by profesion a teacher everybody has a view. We gather from the Tuesday's debate in Congregation at Oxford that the University is now in that agreeable position on the subject of academical education which is commonly called being between two stools. It is the old question of Scholarship and the ancient Oxford curriculum rersws modern information and science. There can be no doubt that the old Oxford curriculum, as it stood before the recent innovations, was a capital one of its sort. It really did what it professed to do-it turned out well-prepared scholarlike minds. No mere examination test is at bottom trustworthy, bat the' old Oxford First Clasi was as 'sterling a test of capacity, of the power of a man to hold a quantity of subjects In his head at 'once, and keep them 8wel a=anged aai. at - command, as any examination sytem could, give. The American philosopher, Mr. ExssoN, an impartial witness, celebrates the " Oxford n," who, with a goad basis of a trained and'strengthenedv capacity, can turn himself to anything. So mucE, then, was to be said-for the old Oxford curriculum. But, in themeantime,itcouldnotbecdeniedlthat the greatest abuses went along with it. It was excellent for the clever men, upon whom it really acted; but it left untouched a large proportion who could not be got to take an interest in the exclusively classical material of the system, and who left the, University every year, having idled away almost the whole of their time there. It was at last seen that the system did not make sufficient allowance for different tastes, or accommodate itself enough to popular progress, and accordingly, some five or six Years ago, a new examination statute was carried, which introduced a school of physical science and modern history into the University system,-the supremacy of classics being saved by the classical school being made com6pulsory, while the undergraduate could fim on which he liked of the others. Some six years have passed since this arrangement was made, and now it turns out in this, as it does in most compromises, that the side which has made the concession has committed itself to more than it intended to do, and that the course of events carries it further than it designed to go. The compromise just mentioned involved the passing of the undergraduate through two schools, instead of one as before, at the final examination; it involved it for this reason, that if the classical school alone had been made compulsory, and no second one impcsed at all, no encouragement whatever would have been given to the newly-introduced material of study. The undergraduate would have very seldom volunteered an additional examination, and the new schools would have been mere extras and inoperative thingsa result which the modernizing party in the 'University would not of course allow. So a passage through two schools is necessary to the compromise,-through the classical one to please the classical party, and through one or other of the modern or scientific schools to pleaI the other party. This double passage was accordingly enforced, till at the end of three years of full operation of the plan-for, on the principle of vested interests, the new plan did not apply to any under. graduates matriculated before its adoption, who had therefore to run out their course under the old system-this double ordeal is found in practice burdensome, involving an awkward and unfair proportion of "plucks," and detaining young men at the University beyond their due time. In this way the plan is found not to work well, and another examination statute becomes necessary. A new statute accordingly, which issued from the Hebdomadal Council at the end of last year, was subsequently thrown back upon the Council for alteration, and now comes out again and forms the subject of the Tuesday's debate in Congregation, reducing the number of schools necessary for the undergraduate to pas through from two to one again. But this of course involves the descent of the clasical school from the supremacy which it had held. Its place at the final examination is now only that of a school which the undergraduate may select out of the whole four schools, and stands on the same level of rank with the modern schools. The return to one school again, though found necessary in practice, thus results in a further blow to the supremacy of classics in the Univerity. Dr. HAwKwns, Dr. PLuVmpns, and Dr. mAxsaur, Heads of Houses of long standing, protest against the step as involving this result, and are for retaining two necessary schools. How far this argumentwill prevail against the generally confessed practical'inconvenience of this arrangement the future rote of Congregation will show; but if the alteration is adopted, with its unfavourable and disliked result, it will, after all, only be an instance of what has taken place and will take place in compromises as long as the world lasts,-viz., that one or other side wil sooner or later find itself committed to more than it intended. There are very few such things as perfectly fair bargains in the world, and especially in bargains between parties and schools, in which the unseen future comes in, perfect justice is very rare. Nobody can tel beforehand exactly how an arrangement will work, what difficulties will arise, and what further changes the practical operation of any given change wiUl be found to involve. The whole world-political, social, and commercial-is a scene of compromise, and of unsteady, fluctuating compromise, which sometimes turns out better and sometimes turns out worse than you expect. The classical party in the University, it would seem, counted upon the patience of the undergraduate and his love of work rather more than it had a right to do. That element has in the calculation failed them. It turns out that he prefers one school to two. We cannot excuse him, but we cannot express any great surprise. Like many others he does not appreciate a privilege. He feels the honsur of being fought for by the ancient and modern party in the University, but he thinks the compliment an inconvenient one in the particular form in which it is paid him-viz., in having to pass through two schools instead of one. But even if Oxford decides upon adopting this proposed change, and alows the classics to be deprived of their supremacy at the final examination, there is matter of consolation. First, there are " Moderations." This, we may inform our nonacademical readers, is a new intermediate examination which takes place a year before the final one. 'Up to this point,-i. e., for two years of the academical triennium-the clasics reign supreme in the place, and nothing interferes with them. In the next place, the supremcy of classics depends, after all, as much upon national and academical tradition and the gen2tus loci as it does upon a formal place in the system of exami- nation. A classical honour must take substantial precedence over other honours at Oxford. It is the wind-up of the whole education of the young men from the first day at school up to that time. The classics are an essential part of the tradition of education in this country; they form the test of the 'qualification for the schoolmaster; they are absolutely necessary to those theological acquirements which stil command respect in theEnglish Church, and are sought with creditable ambition by a certain proportion of her clergy. Classical attainments, then, always must be in requWition in this country, and this, on the principle of demand and suipply, will be sure to keep up their rank and place in the-University. When a, department of knowledge, in short, attains that rankl wich the classics have among us it needs no protection.

Almost at the first sight of our preparations the large host, consisting of about 8,000 men, took to flight, and retreated hurriedly in the direction of DiMul, while hordes -of Arabs were'observed banging on their rear ready to plunder or harass. them. The expedition remained two days atAkwtz, communicating with the Arab tribea,' and securing or destroying large heaps of grain which had been stored there by the Persians. A number of mules and sheep were also captured and brought down by the steamers, and 150 new stands of ' iuskets in cases This done, the little band returned to Mobammerah, which they reached on the 4thinst ' The moral effect of this little affair will be great in these parts, for the Persians had boasted that no force we could bring against Mohammerah could take it in les than a year, and, confident in this overweening security, they had made no pro-' parationa for an orderly retreat. It is clear that tho' - Persian' army in this quarter is utterly disorganized, and can never make head 'gaifist . It was the intention of SirJames to have moved up a suflicient part of our force to occupy Shuiter, and to put the troops into summer quarters in that reputedly healthy locality, and to havetaken theremainder himself to dispersethe Serkeseclmhi Bash's army before l3ushire. The men, indeed, havea great longing to meet this gentleman, whose name thie have curtailed into "-Cheeky Bashi-" but, lo ! all our schemes are for the present held in abeyance by the news, which arrived - yesterday, that peace was signed in Paris on the 4th dlt. What will be done next no one appears to know. It is clear, however, that the authorities at home could not have heard of our victory at Eushab, much lesm of our late successes here. If Feruk Khan has given in to all our just- demands so much the better; but if not, and we have patched up an inglorious peace when our position enabled us to do something better, let the blame fallwhere it is due. We are quite of opinion that some of our demands were not whatthey ought to be-that too much consideration was given to petty complaints of the Mission, many of which were Theoflipring of undignified behaviour on the part 'of some of our own officials. Nevertheles, there-was a just caue for the war, and it is sincerely to be hoped that in any arrangement that 'has been made full atonement and indemnityhave been weured. The nation may rest assured that, had the execution ofthe negotiations been left withSir James-to whose hands, we understand, they were committedtis result would have bee.n attained ere he left the soil of Persia. Now we are in the dark as to what has been done at Paris or in Downing-street. The people here are refilling, the town, and the Arabs from all quarters are sending in their submission. "Never leave us; never let tho Persiabs return," is their constant cry. The bazaars' we now op en, and provisions coming in in abundance; Though no authority has been placed over the town, hardly a complaint has been brought in, and when such occurs, even of a religious nature, the people prefer bringing it to our chaplain, Sir James's Arabic interpreter, than to aeeking the' decision of their own ulema.

AERICA. JA smmary of the following, received by electric taleCPraph, appeared in our second edition of yesterday:-] LIVERPOOL, WEDNXS1JAY. The screw steamship City of Wushington, (aptain W. Wylie, arrived in the Mersey this morning, 'with advices from New York to the 30th ult. She has brought $070,000 specie on freight. On the 9th inat. the City of Wamhington passed a large screw steamer, supposed to be the City ef .Manchester, hence for New York. A steamer, supposed to be the Caledonia, from 3verpool for Montreal, was below Quebee on the -evening of the 29th ult. The Bremen steamship Hansa, Captain Geerkan, from Bremnen for New York, put into Boston on the 29th ilt, short of coals. The authorities at New York were in possession of -a vemsel, the Ellen, of New York, which -was suspected of being a slaver. Serious dissensions are roported to have broken ,out amonghe Mormons, both at San Bernardino and SaltLae. An agent of the American Guano Company had arrived in New York with about four tons of guano from Jervia Island, Pacific Ocean, as a sample. The following extract from the Ronotldu Commer-t Ad dve tiser will be read with interest by agriculturists "The arrival of the fine schooner Liholiho, Captain John Paty, on Satnrday, with about 100 tons of guano, from Jervis and New Nantucket Islands, caused no little excitement in our town. Wben the expedition sailed, on the 25th of December, no one appeared to take much interest in it, further than to exr-tess a general denunciation of all humbugs. The appearance of the specimens of guano which we have seen is that of a fine powder very much resembling wuft without the strong smell of ammonia which the 3dncha guano has. Under a microscope it appears entirely compose of crystallized substance, and resenbles enow. Good judges pronounce it to be first-quality guano, but what its value is comparedl with Chincha guano remains to Ibe determined. About eight tons of this guano goes forward by the bark Yankee, to be sent on by the mail steamer vid Panama to New York, the object being to land it in New York as aoon as possible ; the balance is being shipped on the clipper ship Aspaeia for New York direct, and will reach that port about July 25. The vessel was 10 days from Honolulu to the Islands, and the same number of dayn loading, which was effected with whale-boats. On the 29th of January they sailed for Howland's Island, where they arrived on the 5th of February, landed and erected a hut, brought off a sample of the deposit, and set sail next -day. They saw New Nantucket on the 9th of February, a low island, which as they approached gave faint signs of vegetation in the shape of dry grass and dead bushes on the water's edge. They landed- on the 10th, and were agreeably surprised to find the entire surface of the lsland not only destitute of vegetation, but affording a vast deposit of guano of the very best quality. The Liholiho 2being alrendy well down in the water and somewhat leaky, only 74 bags of this guano were taken on board. The passage to Honolulu was made in 23 days. reckoning from the 12th of February until. the 7th of March ; absence from Honolulu 71 days. The usual course of tho wind was from the north-east or south-east, and, although the voyage was madsi in mid-winter, the weather was mild, excepting the great heat on shore at mid-day. The currents appeared to -change with changes of the moon from the westward or eastward, and from one to one-and-a-half miles an hour. The landing might, perhaps, be considered difficult by iexperienced persons, but it appears to have presented no obstacle to our enterprising voyagers. The agent of the company, Mr. A. Benson, erected uponeach island nfagstaff, upon which nov floats the American flag, and each island has ou it a small house for the protection of the property of the company, as well as a general caveat againstsalintruders. One great drawback to these guano islands is the want of fresh water, not a drop of which is anywhere to be found. Rain seldom falls, as appears by the very dry condition in which they found the guano as deep as four or five feet below the surface. Birds, eggs, and fish are in such abundance as almost to stagger our faith in human testimony. At times the birds were so thick as actually to cloud the atmosphere, and it was almost impossible to step without treading on the nests. Altogether, it seems thesae islads are, by an accounts, wosiderfal places." The fllinoia had arrived at New York from Aspinwall with $1,489,060 in Californian gold. The steamship John L. Stephens cleared from San Francisco on the 6th of April with $1,935,405, of which $401,347 was for England.. The San Francisco money-marketwas tighter than it had been for many months. The receipts of dust from the interior, although large, had not been so heavy as desirable, while the closing up of the business of one of the leading banking houses, and one or two foreign houses who advanced largely, has created an extra demand from those who have to settle up their accounts. There was no change in the character of the advices from the mine, "From all quarters," says the Prices Current, " We hear good reports, and we doubt not that this will prove to be the most prosperous season ever enjoyed. The attention of the people in the mountains is being turned in a marked degree to qnartz, and new mills are being erected, and now veins opened in every direction. The secret of the successful working of quartz has been discovered at last, and there Is no computing the wealth which will be derived from this branch of the mining for years-nay, centuries to come. The placer and hill diggings still continue to yield enormous amounts of gold, and it is well understood among tho miners that tho country has hardly been touched as yet. All we require to double the yield of Kold in California is to double the population. e miners this year have been unusually successful, and there can be no doubt that large sums of money have been sent out of the country by them, both to assist relatives and friends at home and for purposes of investment in other States. Tbe high rateswhich haveruled in Europe formoney for several monthspast havealso been productive of amarked effect in withdrawing foreign capital from the country ; and it is well known that the agents of European houses here -have been drawing in their loans steadily for this reason. It is to be noted, however, that the yield of the precious metals during the past quarter has been extremely large, and, notwrithstanding the small diminution comparatively in the shipments, the armount retained in the country has been heavier than usual." The total amount of gold coined by the branch mint for the last quarter was $6,000,000, showing a decrease of upwards of $160,000 on the same quarter of 1856. The shipment to England in MIarch was nearly $660,000. v A Bill had been adopted by the Legislature, appropriating $4,000,000 for the payment of the State debt, to be submitted to popular vote in September next. The following despatch from General Mora, commnder of the allied forces, to the Costa Ricau Secretary of War, gives the latest intelligence from the seat of war in Nicaragua - "Head-quarters, Esquinas, April 1 oI have informed you of all my operations since I took the command in chief of the allied force. I have now little to add but that little is interesting. "T einvestiture of Rivas is more complete than I had lhoped for, with the disposable forces under my command. The good selection of the posts contributes to this, as well as the service of flying columns established from post to Post, who do not give the besieged breathing time. The 24-pounder does a good deal of execution to the city, and disanimates the enemy. " The day after to-morrow, at the latest, another cannon of the same size, brouiht by .my order from Fort San Carlos, ,wl lbe placed in postion as he port of La Puebla, which General Xatruch occupies, which, united to the fire of the gun here, will completely ruin and cut up the Filibusters They are now reduced to eatinn mule and dog flesh, with sugar instead of salt, and of this they have only a limited qguantity. Those who, driven by bunger, come out to look 1or plantains in the neighbourhood are hunted by my troops, who compel them to retire without effecting their object. Every night small guerilla parties from each post, under my orders, sally out, and, reaching the barricades of the Plaza, raise the alarm among the Fihbusters, causing them to pass the night in suspense, without any risk to our men. These causes, joined to the certainty they now know of their being completely surrounded, cause a desertion of about five maen a-day, who come to my quarters. I estimate that those who take the road to Costa Rica must be at least .hree tlmesas amany, They bave arrived at such a state of weakne tht one of the deserters returned to-day from my camp to the Plaza, entered in his barrack, -circltned a number of the proclamations of his Excellency -the President of Costa Rica; took a rifle, and returned freely .to ms-cam p. "Yesterday and to-day 14 deserters bave arrived. " I am assured that a Guatemalan force X ill be soon in -Granada, and I send tho steamer San Carlos to-morrow to lning them up. "Everything portends our speedy triumpb. " JOSE J. MORA.") Guatemala had sent 3,000 men to reinforce the -Vosta Ricana before WValker. In San Salvador a forced loan of $20,000 a-month had been ordered to be levied for the purpose of organizing a force of 2,000 men and carrying on the war against the Filibusters. General Balloso had been shot for not hiaving externinated the Flibusters at Granada. According to some accounts symptoms of distension between the Costa Ricairs and Nicaraguanl had already shown themselves on the Atlantic side and in the Interior. Rivas sent a Collector of Customs to San Carlos, arid General Mora sent him back with the nmessage that he would -atbend to the collectiona on the river. Colonel Cauty had declared the niver open, and several parties had gone into the interior with passports from him. llforawaa expected at Greytown. A. correspondent of the Yeut Yor. Herald, writing from ABpinwau n th 20th ult., refers to the action of Captain Erakmne, commander of the British squadron in the caas of the Fillibusters under Lockridge's command, and who were disorganized by the blownng up of th3 ateamer Scott. The writer says :_ "This disaster breaking up the proposed expeditionx q Colonel Lockridge's, the mren found therr was down. the river to Greytown, on rafte and in canoes, te i,,t 3nd in a launch that crossed astern of the Scott at the time of the accident. By the 6th most of the anny had reached Greytowin, burying 10 men, who died of their inJuries on the way. At 4 p.m. Colonel Lockridge disbanded tho men, inaking them give up their rnms, and the Tenlnessee, whioh was in port, would, it was expected, take them back to the States; but to their great mortification the Tennessee got up steam and put to sea in spite of the men and of Scott, who signa ed the Orion to stop her, but Captain Ersline refused to do so. The mon, being thus left destitute and without means either of livi or defence, and exrpcting the Cosd icauos to coVown every day, applied to Scott for help, but he refused, and even ordered the sick and wounded to leave the sheds they occupied around the company's premises, A committee was next appointed to lay their case before the commander of the British ships, but they declined to intorfere until the men bad exhausted every means of helping themselves. Thev then seized the Rescue from Loekrsdge and delivered it up to the mayor to hold it as security for their passage money and expeseS. They next forced Scott to come to terms, and by the advice of the British officers he gave draughts on Morgan and Son, at 10 days, for the men's passage, the English ships agreeing to take them to Aspinwall to ship for the United States. These notes were for further security endorsed by the Costa Rican commander, who, on the strength of their being given, undertook not to destroy the property at Punta Arenas. Thus the property was saved from destruction, and on the 14th the men were received on hoard the British ships of war; 175 in the Cossack, Captain Cookburn, and 2%03 in the Tartar, Captain Dunlop, and reached here on the 18th. Colonel Lockridge, General Wheat, and Captain Thompson remained in Greytown, but the latter two came down in the West India mail steamer Clyde, which arrived here to-day. " The foDowing is a copy of the agreement made by the men with the British commander:- " 'By John lphinnstone Esskine, Eeq., Captain of Her Xaaestys' Ship Orion, and Senior Offloer of Her Majestyis Ship3 and Vessels on the Coast of Anseica, "' Paunta Arena, Aprl 14. *Firstly.

JAcKsOr, " I just learn that the Granada will take the 175 men from the Cossack, leaving those of the Tartar (203) to be still provided for. Among the latter there are many (about 50) on the sick list. I understand that the British captains, when there was some doubt of being able to get the men away on the steamer, offered to charter a vessel, fit her Up, and provision her, to take the men to New York; but tfhe United States Consul objected to the ship (a small one) taking more than the legal number of pamsengers; and so this attempt was foiled. A great deal of very bad feeling exists against the British commanders for thu part they have taken, and none of the citizens here, with the exception of the Railroad and Mail Company's agents aPpeared to appreciate the act, or sought to meet the views of the British in the proper sirit. There is no doubt but that the people are chagrine at the brealdng upof the expedition." Her Majesty's ships Cossack and Tartar and the Royal mail steamship Thames were at Aspinwall on the 20th ult. The United States' frigate Cyane was also there. The Cossack was to leave Aspinwall on the 21st for Carthagena. Of the 170 Filibusters landed from the Cossack about 100 were sent to New Orleans by the steamer Granada, and 68 took passage for New York by the Illinois. Arrangements were being made to send the 200 remaining on board the Tartar to the United States by sailing vessels. Rer Majesty's ship Orion, Captain Erskine, had. left San Juau for the purpose of blockading Cartha. gena, the Mackintosh debt dispute not having been arranged. A couple of United States' men-of-war were at Bogota, ready to take possession of the place on receipt of instructions from Washington. In the House of Representatives it had been proposed to raise a loan of $500,000 for the defence of New Granada in the event of an invasion by the United States. The official journal of New Granada had published the correspondence between Messrs. Bovwlin and Morse, and Senors Pombo and Onzales. It appears that the six points said by the Tiepo to have been demanded by the United Statee' Government, are not correct, and the following is the actual demand:- " L To constitute the cities of Panama and Aspinwall into two independent municipalities, independent and neutral, with the power of self-government extending over the territory of 10 miles wide on each side of the rairoad. Perfect freedom of the transit route. Neutrality and liberty guaranteed. The Sovereignty not changed. Other nations to be invited to join in the guarantee. * 2. To cede to the United States, in ful sovereignty, the two small groups of islands in the Bay of Panama for a naval station, and all the rights and Privileges reserved in the raUroad contract, for an ample consideration. *" 3. To pay for the damages occasioned by the outbreak on the 15th of April, '4. The sum to be paid by the United States." All these New Granada absolutely and decidedly rejects, and, in her turn, claims the sum of $150,000 from the United States for damages done to Panama and New Granadian citizens by Americans on the 15th of April; that the 'United States owes reparation to New Granada for the rade protest of Colonel Ward, dated April 21, and for the disrespectful letters of Commodore Mervine and Captain Bailey. From Kingston, Jamaica, we learn that on the 10th ult. a schooner-evidently American-was towed into port by Her Majesty's brig Arab. It was soon ascertained that the schooner was a slaver, and that she had on board a large number of captives. It appears that the captain of the Arab had received information that a bark and schooner were expected in Cuba from the Coast of Africa each with a cargo of slaves. A strict wateh was therefore kept, and on Monday, the 13th, a suspicious - looking craft was seen, with a full press of sail, making the best of her way to her destined port. She was closely pursued, and the captain, finding that there was no possibility of escaping from the Arab, deserted her, taking with him in a shallop his crew, money, chronometer, and other useful articles. The commander of the Arab despatched his gunboat with 15 men, underthecommand of his first lieutenant, with orders for the capture of the shallop. The chase continued for nearly three hours, and a shot having destroyed therudder of the shallop the captain, who was owner of the slaver, surrendered. Two of his principal slaves and an interpreter were taken from the shallop, and the crew left in it to make the best of their way to Cuba. The Arst lieutenant then boarded- the schooner, and found her filled with young Africans, males and females, to the num- er of 373, no less than 127 having fallen victims to the horrors of the middle passage during a voyage of 29 days. The poor captives were in a wretebed condition; all of them were naked, and the greater part seemed to have been half-starved. They were packed closely together, and covered with dirt and vermin. The captain of the schooner refused to give his name or the name of the vessel, but stated that he would be a loser of $30,000-a loss which did not cause him much concern, as he had made other and successful trips. A great deal of information, however, was obtained from the interpreter, who mentioned that several vessels were left on the African coast-that they were to have sailed soon, with full cargoes-that,. upon an average, two vessels departed weekly, each with 500 to 700 slaves on board-that the trade was rapidly increasing-and that the slaves on being landed in Cuba were worth $500 to $700 each. The Kingston Free Press de- scribes the appearance of the " cargo " :- "I have just returned from Fort Augusta, from among some of the meet miserable specimens of humanity it has ever been my il-fortune to witness.

GROWTH OF COTTON IN INDIA. Ath meeting of the Society of Arts held at the Rooms of the institution, Adelphi, last evening1, a paper on the question, "f.ow canincre ~asduPPlies of cotton be obtainedfor the manufactures of this country," was road by Mb. 3. B. Smith, M.P. for Stockport. There was a faul attendance of members on the occasion, and an interesting discussion on the subject of the lecture followed its delivery. Among those present were Lord Stanley, M.P., Sir J.Pakington, ALP., Sir E. Perr, M.P., Mr. Hladfield, M-P Mr EHindley. M.P., Mr. B. W. Wathin, M.P., Mr. la. ~e M.P., Mr. W. William% MP., Coloel Rathbone, Thomas Barnes, Dr. Livrmgstone, Dr. Buist, Mr. Wentworth Di'ke, Mr. F. Gibson, Mr. H. Clarke, Mr. E. Ashworth, Mr. Winkworth, and Mr. Montgomery Martin. The chair was occupied by Mr. Thomas Bazley, of Mlanchester, who, after a few prefatory retmarks, introduced the lecturer to the mieeting. Mr. SNaTE opened his subject by observing that the importance of our cotton manufacture was best shown by the fact that, after providing clothing for our whole population, our exports last year amounted to 32,284,7001., being one-third of the value of our entire exports to foreign eountries. Unfortunately, our supplies ofthe raw material were principally derived from one source. The Imports of cotton into Great Britain last year amounted in round numbers to 900.000,0001b., of which 700,000,0001b. -were received from the 'United States. But not only were we exposed to the danger of being limited chiefly to one source of supp7y, but to a still greater hazard, owing to the circumstance that this supply -was the production of slave labour. In the earlier stages of the cotton manufacture we obtained our supp lies from various countries in the Mediterranean, the West India Islands, Brazil, and South America; and as late as 1810 ourimports from the United States were only 246,759 bales, while from all other countries they were 314,414 bales. In that year the price of Upland cotton ranged from 15d. to 22d. per lb., and Vwest India cotton from 21d. to 2s. 4d. per lb. From this time the growth in the 'United States constantly increased, and ultimately it became evident that the production had overtaken the demand. The effect of this oversupply was a decline in the rices of cotton from 22d. per lb. to 5d. to 8d. per lt which gave a great stimulus to increased manufacture. 'i the last 40 years the consumption in Great Britain had risen from 88,000,,0lb. to 891,000,0001b. The increase In the powth of cotton had not for some years past kept pae with the inmreased demand, and in his opinion we bad arrived at the turning point, of the consumption having at length overtaken the production. The pssibility of developing other sources of supply became, therefore, of vital Importance. Mr. Smith then reforred to the capabilities of Western Africa, mentioning some efforts that had been made by Mr. Thomas Clegg, of Manchester, to promote the cultivation of cotton by the natives. After touching upon some other countries where the growth of It might hereafter be extensively carried on, the lecturer said he regarded India as capable of furnishing an unlimited supply. he imports from that country had alys been Irre r and to secure a const-ant demand it was necessary that she should be able to compete with America. He was thus let to the inquiry into the capabilities of India for producing cotton equally cheap and good with that grown in that country. The soil of India in general was by no means fertile, the cause of this sterility being the want of sufficient moisture. The ruins of great igating works still found showed that formerly the rulers of Hindostan were impressed with the importance of irrigation, but latel7 this agency had been entirely neglected. We ought to avai ourselves of the superior engineering skill of the present age to devise a systematic plan of irriation, by whichthe whole country should be furnished with canals, which might also be used for the cheap conveyance of produce. It s estimated that land might be provided with a censtant supply of water by these means at a cost of 2s. 6d. per acre per annum. Another difsiculty was the absence of roads and other means of communication. For want of roads In India eotton was brought a distance of 400 miles to a shipping port on the backs of bullocks; each bullock carrying aDout 401b., and the journey occupied from two to three months. When the railway reached the cotton district, which at the present rate of progress might be expected some 10 or 15 yean hence, the transit to a shipping port which on an average had hitberto occupied 64 days, would be accomplished in 36 hours. One of the greatest obstacles to the increased production of cotton in India was the tenure of Iand, for, except in Bengal, noperson in India, native or European, could own in fee-simple a single acre. Mr. Smith dwelt at some length on the injurious operation of this system on theanterprise of the people, exposed as they frequently were to exactions from corrupt officials, and spoke of the beneficial effect of a wiser policy in our colonies and in other parts of the world. The ste of the law and the police ofludia wasunother serious evil; and it was remarkable how small a number of British subjeets voluntarily settled in India, who were not actually in the service of the Company. After replying to the attempts made to defend the existing system, the lecturer drew especial attention to the province of Candeish, one of the richest of India, and containing 5,000,000 acres of land capable of growing cotton, with great facilities for irrgation. There was landin this one province alone capable of producing more cotton than was now grown in theUnited States. At present only14per cent. of the whole province was cultivated, the remaining 86 per cent. lying waste; and he deemed this a favourable opportunity for trying the experiment of iving a secure tenure of land in perpetuity,-a policy which had resulted in so much prosperity in our own colonies as well as in the United States. Mr. Smith supported his statements tbroughout by an ample array of statistics, and concluded his address, of which the foregoing is necessarily but a faint outline, with a glowing allusion to the prospect that Eogland would be the instrument under Providence of securing by one and the same measure the elevation of the down-trodden millions of India and the emancipation of the oppressed African race. The discussion was commenced by Mr. J. B. Sharp, of Manchester, whose remarks were chiefly supplementary to the statistical and historical information furnished by the lecturer. Mr. WATExN, M.P., thanked Mr. Smith 'not ronly for pointing out the dangers of a short supply of cotton, but also indicating a remedy suited to the emergency. This question only required to be thoroughly ventilated to enable the practical intellects of Englishmen to apply that remedy. He took blame to himself, incommon with the rest of his countrymen, for remaining quiescent while the vast continent of India was lying waste, and no adequate efforts were made by the Governmentfor utilizing its anexhaustible resources. No one could guarantee the permanence of the " peculiar institution" of our Trantlantic kinsfolk, on whom we were principally dependent for our supplies; and we ought, therefore, to turn to our own dominions for a less precarious source whence to draw this important raw materiaL They did not ask the East India Company to grow cotton by Act of Parliament, but only to remove the obstades which impeded its cultivation. Mr. CLAni called attention to the advantages of soil andalimatewhich many districts of the sub-Himalayan range possessed for the production, by European as well as native agency of cotBon of superior quality. Bailways would, in his opinion, afford an economical means of trasporting this commodity from the interior. Sir B. PZRRY commented on the absenee from the meeting of Colonel Sykes, Mr. Mangles, and other members of that society connected with the Government of India, 'who if they had been present might have dispeUed Mr. Smith's errors or confirmed his arguments. (A laugh.) It was deeply to be regretted that the merchants and manufacturers of this country did not come forward three years ago, when Indian affairs underwent a Parliamentay inquiry, as they did 20 years before, when the opening of the China trade was in question. But he hailed the movement now beiu set on foot on this subjec' by the men of Manchester, an augured from their wellknown energy and intelligence that it would be fruitful iu the most beneficial results beth to this country and to India. If asked the cause why the developement of the resources of our Eastern empire had been impeded, he should answer because the Government of that empire was confided to a monopolzing company, whose policy was to keep down British enterprise and British colonization. Before India could proper,and the owth of cotton and other products, for which she had unlmited capabilities, could be fostered and stimulated, she must be placed under the direct government of the Queen. The ad. mirable working of the latter system of administration was illustrated by the example of Ceylon, in which a thriving middle class was now springing up and a large surplus revenue existed; whereas in India there were only two classes in the community-the money leader, with enormous wealth, and the miserable cultivator, who lived under a cocoa-nut tree; while there was a heavy annual deficit in the finances. Dr. LIVmGsTONx said that in Western Africa cotton was grown all over the country by the natives unaided by European superintendenca; and vast quantities might be produced there for exnortation. The Portuguese, however, were in India 120 yoars wit out knowing the value of tea, and they might be much longer in Africa without discovering the value of cotton. (A laugh.) In the centre of the country cotton was still cultivate4 there being sufficdent moisture for the pu e alltheyeas round; and when going down the &mbese he saw rWo kinds of the plant growing. The eonntry at Angoa was also excessively fertile, and the article maght be praduced tere to an indefinite exstent. In Eastern Africa te advantages were not so great.. I-ord STANLEY observed that an increa3a of ld. per lb. on the price of cotton caused a loss to iie people of this country of between 4,000,0001. and 5,%0,0001. sterling, or very little less than the total amm.t of the incometax paid before the war. Again, our dependence on America not only remained, l,ut yearly increased. In 1801 45 per cent. of our enti,re consumption was derived from the United States; i-A 1826 the ratio rose to 72 per cent.; while, according to ;he last returns, it had now actually reached 80 per oent-. How did this bear upon slavery? At the beginnin.i of the century there were 220,000 slaves in the cOt.wn-growing Statesof America. The number was how 2,0C 000O, two-thirds of whom were employed in the produc+,jo, of this one article, an enormous proportion of which w shipped to England. Cotton composed four-fiftls of the whole exports of the slave States. The stimulus thus given to the system Of slaveholding in America was too obvictGD to need to be stted. Next, as to the remedy. Besides Anenrica, they must chiefly look for theLr supplyof cotton to India at the present and to Africa in the future. With resect to India bo could indirectly conrim the statement of Sir E. Perry as to the example of the comparatively small colony of Ceylon. While he (Lord Stanley) was in that island an idea got abroad that it was about to be annzexed to the Indian Government; and he well recollected the alarm-be might, perhaps, use a stronger woxd-with which that idea was entertainedby thelinhabitants. (Hear, hear.) It was better to avoid the perplexing Indian landrevenue question. That source furnisbed two-thirds of the whole income of the State; and it therefore could xOt be very easily given up altogether. But, assuming that the lad revenue was continued, it was fair matter for consideration whether it could not be made a fixed instead of a fluctuatingpaymuent. (Hear.) This would obviate the objectionfoundedon its operating asa discouragement toinproved cultivation. It was hardly possible to exaggerate the present deficiency of internal communication in India. Where the nature of the country rendered it Tracticable canals would be the best means of supplying this want, as far as regarded the transport of cotton, inasmuch as they would serve the double purpose of conveyance snd irrigation. Railways, while they would answer only one of these ends, were better adapted for passenger traffic and ligbt goods than for heavy commodities. Where, however, it was desirable to introduce railways in India the American plan would be more suitable than the English. That was to say, they should be of rough construction, little cost, and low speed- and when the first returns of the original line enab ed them to do so they might lay down a more perfect scheme. The noble lord concluded by moving a vote of thanks to Mr. Smith for his excaDent lecture. Sir J. PAxINGTON, in seconding the motion, remarked that the direct pecuniary interests of England pointed unmnistakeably to a better flfilment on her part of the grave responsibility she bad undertaken in connexion with the Government of India. It was scarcely possible for a body of reflecting men to have brought before them a subject worthier of their serious consideration, and he thought it most important that it should undergo discussion in Parliament hcheers), where he believed there were many members qualified to grapple with it. Mr. CRAWFORD held that Mr. Smith had over-rated the capabilities of India for the growth of cotton. The more populous parts of that country did not grow enough of the article for their own consumption, and had to import it in considerable quantities. Pegu, however, might perhaps be made to afford us a portion of our supply. Mr. MobGommy MAhRTw briefly replied to the last speaker, and maintained that until the people were allowed to obtain the fee simple of the laud iu India British capital and skill would never be introduced into that country The vote of thanks wias then unanimously agreed to, and the meeting separated.

Dr. MAdden, surgeon, of Heavitree, was immediately sent for, but on his arrival he found that life was extinct. At a coroner's inquest, held on Tuesday, evidence was adduced to show that the deceased had for some time been in a low, desponding way, and the jury returned a verdict of " Temporaryinsanity."

When they had left, 3x.

I could not see two better persons then connected with the Tipperary Joint-stock Bank to act as directors, from their great experience in connexion with one of the most respectable institutions in London. I also mentioned to Mr. F. Scully as to his becoming a director, as Mfr. Kennedy had left the banl, and he agreed to do so from the 1st of February, 1856. " I now take this opportunity of just asldng what is MEr. James Sculy's ease worse than mine? Iam required to pay up cals on shares the greater portion of which were the property of the late Mr. John Sadleir, placed in my name as his trustee temporary a very short time before his death, a large portion of whicA no transfer was ever executed for, legal or llegal; I never owed the bank or any bank a shilling, but always had a considerable sum to;my credit in the Tipperary Joint-stock Bank, anu during the ran 5,0001. due to me, which I might have drawn out, or even after Mr. John Sadleir's death. I never had any connexion, directly or Indirectly, with any one of the numerous speculations Mr. John Sadleir appears to have been mixed up in, or any other speculation. From the moment I discovered in London, late in 1855, the extent of the land transactions he was mixed up in, and railways in England, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, aud Itly, 1 denounced him in the strongest language I could for having allowed himself under any circumstances to be engaged in so many undertalkngs, though Ihad the strongest assurance from himself and some of his friends that large and immediate payments were to come to him from each undertaking; and I have got the sumsin a return given to me that-were to come from each. From all the information I could, coUect a short time before his death, from himself and some of his friends, I was fully satisfied the worat was over, and that he was fast getting out of the temporary difficulties he had got into, and that he would have a considerable surplus after paying all debts that I had any knowledge of. " You also state, in your publication of the 30thult. that Mr. Vincent Scplly was to receive 7.0001. for his shares from Mr. James Sagleir, payible in 1857, the shares to be transferred to Mr. Keating. * " I beg to state I never had anything to say to Mr. Vincent Scully, directly or indirectly, as to his shares, nor did Iever owe himsixpence- nordidlheara word of his agreement with Mr. John badleir and Mr. Keating tiU Mr. Keating showed me the document in London a considerable time after it was exeouted.

I state nothing here but what can be proved, and I trust, in justice, you will not object to publish this letter. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, "JAMES SADLEIR." The Bvening Post thus comments upon this audacious epistle:- "Thestatementin the paragraph to which the asterisk is affixed appeared in thejudgoaent of the llord Chancellor, reported an this journa on the 30th ult. In the report of at Judgment there was the verbal mistake of James for John Sadleir, the latter being the person to whom the Chancellor manifestly referred. It is necessary for us to make one or two remarks on this letter, which is calenlated-if that were possible-to place the writer in a still worse position before the public. Mr. James Sadleir has a right to a reply, through our columns, to a letter that had appeared in this journal. But he has no right, after all that has occurred, to play the innocent in this fashion, and to describe himself as a person actually aggrieved, in contrast with some of the victims of the horible system rarried on by John Sadleir, through his instrumentality, in the Tipperary Bank. On the 20th of June, 1856, the Master of the loIls, in giving judgment in the case of one of the English shareholders, John Ginger, read a letter from John Sadleir to his brother, the managing director of the Tipperary Bank, addressed, 'My dear James,' bearing date ' London, 31st December, 1855,' and giving directions for the'doctoring of the amcounts of the Tipperary Bank for the year then terminated. Did James Sadleir repudiate the mnfamous suggestions made by John 7No ; but they were adopted and carried out, in substance if not in form. At the annual meeting, held in February, 1856, a report was read, which thus concluded:-' The directors [there was only one director, James Sadleir] are happy to have it in their power to report to the shareholders that the course of the bank continues satisfactory, and the improving aspect of affairs in the country Induces them to feel confident that the business of the bank willgo on extending, and that the annual profits will be thus steadily increased. The directors (i. e. James Sadleir) have the honour to lay before the shareholders the usual detailed statements of the accounts of the bank, with assets and liabilities, for the information of the shareholders. The statement showsa that, after all necessary deduction and the payment of a dividend on the paid-up capital of 100,0w1. at the rate of 61. per cent. per annum, for the yearendingthe 31st of December, 1855, and the payment of a bonus for the year of 31. per cent. (both free of incometax), tere remains a balance of 3,303. 12s. 4d., which the directors recommend should now be carried to the credit of the reservedfund, whichwillthenamount to thesum of 17,3751. 12s, 7d. "'JAMES SADILEIR, Chairman?' 'At the very time this picture of prosperity was drawn by Mr. James Sadleir he well knew that the Tipperary Bank wasin a state of utter and hopeless insolvency, the rslt of a most heinous system of plunder. The asets of the bank were represented in the balance-abeeb submitted to the meeting in February, 1856, as 612,959 129. 3d., the shillngs andpence being set dowix with the most minute particulaiy in this unexampled contrivance of fraud and perfidy.

We have done so. and aecompanied it y a statement which once more places the facts before the public,anddealsoutto him that measue of 'justice' to which he is entitled." TS. IRsISH LABOUR-sARKET. Letters from the country continue to speak of the enormous advance of the rate of wages paid to the agricultural labourer, as compared with the standard which prevailed in the olden times of potato cheapness, and consequent inertness on the partof the working population. A gentleman who left Dablin last week, with a view of investing a small capital in land in the county of Galway, returned hastily to town without effecting his object, the failure being attributable less to the heavy rent demanded for land of secondary quality than. to the prospect of even a higher scale of wages, being ere long general throughout the west, unles. some check is given in the meantime to the present-. rapid progreasof emigmrption. The farmers, he ssys, large. and small, are enjoying a state of prosperity without parallel since the last great European wa;".

Many farmers of the smallr class, holdwsof from 20 to 30 acres, although shares.is the general properity, show no outward symptouU of improved circumstances. There is the same modest diet, the same humbl dwelling, aud no ebsiage for the better can be noticed ix trie demof the mens~omen.

AR2P TREASBRES EXHIBITION. There was-a fair attendance yesterday, tegh. ' the number of visitors was less than on some vious days. We believe it is in contemplation to removethe orchestra, to make room for a oosidersble number of works. of art which have never yet found a place. Within the next fortnight probably every d'epartinent of the Exhibition wilL be put into permranent form, the executive conmnittee; being indisposed to receive any further contributions, under any circumstances, having no spacm for them. The shilling admissions commence next; week, when we may expect to iee a mnuch greater ciumber, of visitors, though, no doubt, the great bulk of the-working clasese will postpone their visit until the Vhitsuntide holydays. A considerable numberof members of the Society of Arts are ex- ected to visit Manchester for the Exhibition in a. My, and similar visits are spoken of from members of the Law Society and other learned bodies during the sumimner. The C6uncil of the Manchester Royal Institu- Eion proposes to give a series of soivees weekly : during the'timoe the Art Treasures Exhibition remaini open, as a miueaz of iidording a pleasnt opportunity for rjunions among disnghed strangers visiting Manchester.

About 5. oclock, south of tbe tsown, were heard thw. rumblings of distant thunder, and Very skortly afterwards the storm poured out its fury oyer the town.

THE LIOENSING SYSTEM. TO TM EDITOR OP THE TIMS. Sir,-Barly in the sesion of 1853 a Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to inquie into the licensig system. It consisted of tlhe Ear of March, Lords Dudley Stusrt and Ernest Bruce, Sirs John Pakington, rge Goodman, and George Grey, the Hon. Charles Villiers and Henry Fltzroy, and Mlessrs. Wilinam Brown Beckett, R:arrow, Gregeon, Forster, Packe and beedes; to whom were subsequently added kIess Ker Seymer, Levis Ricardo, Lowe, and Sotheron. These noblemen and gentlemen inquired diligently 5nto the various questions bearing on the licenmnz system, asking 10,193 questions of between 60 ana 0' witnesses. In the session of 1854 they again met, and came to a unanimous report, the gist of which was that the beer trade,which is now a monopoly, should be thrown open; that any person able to satafy the magistrates that his character was good, and to provide sufficient securities, should be entitled to obtain a license to sell beer, wine, and spirits; and that the conduct of such persons should be subjected to a very stringent police supervision. When this report was publiBhed the public looked to the Home Secretary as the proper person to bring in such a Bill as would carry its recommendations into effect. But they looked in vain. It was intl. mnated to them, not unreasonably, that the beer rmonopolists were powerful in the Hlouse and in the country; that a dissolution of Parliament was imminent; and that it would be hard to press Sir George Grey to ruffle such an important interest on the eve of a general election. They were assured that as soon as a new Parliament assembled the Home Secretary would forthwith produce and carry a measure which would do effectnally what the abortive Beerhouse Bill of 1830 had totally failed to do -viz., destroy the moiopoly now established in favour of a few bloated brewers, and enable the middle and lower classs to enjoy pure malt and hops at a fair market price. Well, Sir, the new Parliament bas aem bled. Mr. Ker Seymer has asked Sir George Grey for his Beer Bill, and Sir George Grey has answered that, although the licensing system is, in his opinion, in a most unsatisfactory state, he has no intention of bringing in any Bill at all on the subject, either this session or the next, " beause the enormous capital invested in the beer trade renders it necessary that the question should be dealt with with the utmost care"-in other words, because the brewing monopoly ia very rich and has a good_many votes in the If Sir George Grey really believes that the able and enlightened gentlemen whoss names I have enumerated have not inquired into the subjet with sufficient attention and success, let him move for a fresh committee, and inquire fiurther; but, as he fully admits the evils of the present state of things, deferring all legislation on the subject sine die indicates more certainly that he is ready to sacrifice the public good in order to conciliate a few affluent mono oiists than that he desires to exercise any remarkable care ini meting out justice to them and to the public. Meantime Mr. Hardy steps in, declaring himself prepared to prove that the report of the committee of 1851 was contrary to the evidence taken by it, and gives notice of his intention to Introduce a Bill strongly corroborative of the existing monopoly. There appear to be two partiec by whom Mr. Hardy-a well-meaning man, who does not understand what he is about-is prompted,-the brewers, who are, of course, anxious to maintain the monopoly under which they thrive so rankly; and the total abstinence party, who have been persuaded that any change in the law will increase the consumption of fermented and spirituous liquors. The latter party allow themselves to be made the cat's-paw of the former, who, so far from defending their monopoly openly, deny that it exists, and have the effrontery to pretend that their only objection to the sunggested change in the existing law proceeds from their apprehension that it will cause more beer to be consumed than is at present drunk I I cannot believe that the new House of Commons -viU so far deviate from its duty as to allow the Govenment to stand aloof in this matter, waiting to see what turn the discusaion on Mr. Hardy's Bill takes; for such, according to Sir George Grey, is the course which they at present are inclined to adopt. The prems and the public are, I believe, unanimous in desiring that the monopoly should be overthrown, and with a proper pressure from without I have no doubt that the Rome Secretary may be urged into worthier and more vigorous action.

OENPTTAL CRIMINAL COURT, Ma-Y 13. OI;D COURT. T.kIAL OF BACON AND IS WU FOR THEE MUIRTflR OF TI crLDREN. At the sitting of the Court this morning, at half-past 9 O'clock, Thomas Fuller Bacon, described as a smith, aged 32 and Mrtha Bacon, his wife, aged'26, wern placed at tho bar before Mr. Commissoner PstmND]mGSAT to plead to the indiotments charging them with the wilfal murder of their two children, Sarah Anne Bacon and Edwin FMller Bacon. The procoedings appeared to create a great deal of ixte. res, and very soon after the doors of the coort were opened, at 9 o'eloek, a good many persons were in attendauce, ,nd the court would no doubt have) been inconveniently crowded but for the excollent rangements that were mado by Messrs. Crosley and Anderton, the under sheyifi, to prevent confusion. The prisoners, immediately on their names being called, walked to thie front of the dock. The female prisoner did not evince the least emotion duing the reading of the in. dletments, or at any stage of the proceedings. The male prisoner was, however, evidently in a state of considerable mental excitement, and he listenod with great and eanest attention to the whole of the evidence that was brought forward in support of the prosecution, aad also to the opening speech o'f Mr. Boddn,. The indictments having been read over to the prisoner, they both pleaded " Not Gallty," and a jury was then empaneUed to try them. At 10 o'clock, Lord Chief Justoe Campbell, accompanied by Mr. Justle CresweU and Mr. Baron Bramwell, and the Lord Mayor end Sheris, entered the court and took their seats on the bench, and the prisoners, who, during the short interval that elapsed had been removed, were again placed atthe bar. The indictment then zproceeded with charged the pri. soners jointly with the wlful murder of Edwin Fuller Bacon. Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Clark conducted the prosecution; Mr. Metcalfe and Mr. Poland defended the male prisoner; and Mr. Sleigh and Mr. Lawrence appeared for Mrs. Bacon. Before the proceedings of the trial commenced Mr. Met. calfe applied for the permission of the Court to allow the prisoners to be eated; and the request was at once granted. Mr. BODKIN then rose to opon the cse for the prosecm. tion. He said, the tak devolved upon him of laying before the jury the facts and circumstances under which it was sought to bring home to the prisoners at the bar the orimo of wilful murder. He need hardly remiad them that this was one of the most heinous crimes known to the law, and that 5t 'was one, therofore, which under asy circumsances demanded and wag sur to receive the most serious oonsideration at the hands of a jury; but the present case was one eo almost unparalleled in the circumstances connected with it and had excited so much public attention that in all sincerity he most earnestly entreated them not to allow anything they might have heard or read uponthe subject to Influence in any way the decision they might arrive at, but that they would be guided only by the sworn testimony that would be laid before them. The circumstances connected with the crime appeared to be most extraordinary, and he was bound to adamit at the same time that he should nor be able to establish any apparent motive for Its commission, and he should therefore content himself with laying all the facta before them, and leave them to form their own conclusion as to the inference they ought to draw from those facts in deciding the question as to the guilt or innooonce of the prisoners, The position in which the accused persons stood towards the deceased, and the fact that they were charged with destroying the lives of their own offEpring at a period of their existenoe when they were generally most dear to parents, coupled vith the fact that he should not be able to show any absence of the ordinary affection that usually existed between parents and their offspring previously, on the part of tho prisoners, was anong the many difficulties that were thrown in the way of the prosecution; but he should lay beforethem all the facts, and it would be for the jury to say in the result whether there was any reasonable doubt that both these unhappy children had met their deaths at the bands of one or both of the prisoners The learned counsel then proceeded to give a brief outline of the ease for the prosecution, and said that both the prisoners lived at No. 4, Four-Acre-street, lambeth, and it appeared that on tho 28th of December they hed both gone to the house of a relative, and an arngement was made that a person named Hanmah Munro, who wa related to the prisoners, should go to their house on the followins aay and remain with Mrs. Bacon while her husband was engaged upon some job of work at Reigate. She accordingy went, but, after knocking for a considerable time at the door of the prisoners' house, and finding the conld not gain admiseion, she went home, and retumed on the fol. lowing morning, accompanied by her mother, a. woma namned Payne. Whea:t.y came to Four-Ae-strhet thw met the prisoner (Mrs. Baen) with a book in her hand vhich turned out to be herrent.book; and she said she was going to lay her rent and appeared perfectly calm and eol. lected. ome ight conversation t en it aped, took place between the prisoner and the two ot er women, and the prisoner then suddenly exclaimed that some man had got into the house and had murdered her two children and endeavoured to out her throat. Upon the prisoner making this statement the two women weunt back with her to the house, and they thern saw the horrible spectacle of the little boy, Who WAs about three years old, sitting in a chair in the back room on the ground floor with his throat out and quite dead, and in the upstairs room the little girl, who was younger than her brother, was found in the same condition. The injuries they had received were of such a nature as to cause almost immediate deatb, and the opinion of the medical man who was caled in was that they had been dead at least 24 hours. He thought It right to inform them that the female prisoner bad undoubtedly suffered from aberration of mind, and during the past year she had been confined in the St. Luke's asylum, and had only left that asylum in October, about two months before this melancholy occurrence took place; and this was a matter which ought, no doubt, to bave a most imnportant bearing upon the present inquiry. The story that was told by tbe female prisoner, and her representation that some men had got into the house and committed the murders, the jury would at once see vas most absurd and improbable; and it was clearly established, from the examination of the premises by the police, that no person had entered the house in the way described, and from the fact of her clothes being found covered with blood, and other circumstances, it appeared to him that there could be no reasonable doubt that the female prisoner, either by herself or assistad by her husband, had destroyed the lives of her unhappy children. Shewas at onoe taken into custody, and after she had untder gone one or two examinations she wrote a letter which it would be his duty to lPay before them. This letter was addresed to the magistrte, and was to the following effect ;- " Sir,-t rmust cenferS that Ira atn Innocnt i, and tb&t be who committed the dreadful deed ww mh hsand ant t ia no moDey in the drawer. He put e litle h i a I and t ww throat, and then went upstairs a3d out tbe batb aos tt, and he onl, It was right that he should inform them that this letter was only produced as evidence against the female prisoner, and to show that at all events she was present when the dreadful deeds were committed, and the jury ought not to allow that letter at aU to operate as evidence against the male prisoner. As regarded him, he should briefly state the circumstances upon which he should rely, to show that he was, at any rate, cognizant of the murders having been committed, and the probability that he was present and aided in their commission. It would appear that on the Monday morning the prisoner went to work at Reigate, and there could be very little doubt that at this time both the children were dead. It 'was not, however, necessary he should show that the male prisoner was actually present when the deed was commited, for if the jury should be of opinion that he was aw^are of vvhat his wife was going to do, and that he counseUed and sanctioned her ac he would, by the provisions of a most excellent statute that had recently been passed by the Legislature, be equaly amenable to the law as an accessory. The learned counsel then proceeded to state that he should show that the conduct and demeanour of the prisoner at Reigate was so extraordinary as to attract marked attention. He was unable to do any work, and presented all the appearances of a man who had some weighty and important matter upon his mind, and he continued in that state until he was fetched baok to London by the police. It was right to state that the pisoner exhibited all the appearance of sorrow and distress that would be expected from a man under such circumstances; but it appeared that down to the period of the holding of the inquest the prisoner upheld the story of his wife as to the manner in whieli the lives of the children had been destroy^ed. It appeae, however, that subsequently a suggestiion, was thrzown out that if tea~ livs or tne catidren bad been destroyed by a -str the object must have been plunder, and the condnct of the prisoner after this appeared to have been of the mqt extraordinay descripton, and the jury, when they heard the facts, 'would have to decide the question whether suchL conduct on his part could be consistent with innocence, or whether it did not amount to proof that he was concerned in tho commission of the crime, and that his object was to manufacture evidence with a view to bolster up the story that had been told by his wife as to the manner in which the children came by their deaths, thus to dissrm suspicion. He then proceeded briefly to narrate the particulars of the false sttements made by the male prisoner relating to the property and money which he represented had been stlon, and said he shouldsatify the jury that the whole of these statements were entirely without foundation. He also sid he should be able to show that there were marks of blood upon tbo clothes of the male prisoner, 'which he accounted for in two different ways,-first saying that he had cut his finger 'while carving the dinner on the Sunday before the murder, and then alleging that he had done so while engaged in cutting some 'wood; and it would be for the jury to form their own conclusions as to the effect of these contradictory stories With resoect to the female prisoner, he sid he had to inform themn ihat when she was first discovered there ro inuries upon her nec, but they were of the me nrfciat kind, and such as might have been inficed iterby .heraef or by some other persou with a view to sup rrt the story she told relating to the deaths of t ch1idren. As to her, there. fore it appeared to him that the onmly question t could possibly arise was whether at the time the act wa committed she wa in a stae of mind to be re sponsible for her actions, and upon thu point ho would reminlthe jury that the fact of her having been confinmd in a lunatic asyuam was not at all conclusive, but thev mu,i be satisfied ttat at the time the act was committed sme was in such a conlition of mind as not to know that she was doing wrong or that she was commntting a crime. He belioved that the defeneo that would be set up on the part of the male prisoner would be that he had told all these falsehoods for the purpose of screening his wife; but it was for them to say, loohdng at all the circs1satnces of the case, to the demeanoor of the prisoner to the discovery of the blood upon his clothes, and the other facts to which he had called their attention, whether this wFas a seasonable and probable eanwer to the charge, and whether they would be justified an giving effect to it. The learned counsel concluded by expressiag an earnest ho;c that He to whom the secrets of all hearbswere open would aid themin coming to a justand righteous decison. The following evidence was then addaced:- Mr3s Hannah Munro sald,-I live in Asylum-streetw Mileend, and the male prisoner is my couin. I waz in the habit of visiting the prisoners at their former residence. I saw them both on Sunday the 28th of December at my uncle'sandmy brother-in-laws. Isawthefemale prisoner at my uncde's 3tween 9 and 10 o'clock in the evemng, and she asked me to go and see her on the following day and remain with her whle her husband was away at Reigate. I agreed to do so, and it was arranged that I was to go be. tween 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon. I had seen the male prisoner at my brother-in-law's before this, and he also asked me to come to honse the next day, andI told him I would do so. I was only in company with the prisoners a few minutes on this day. I cannot reeolleot how the male prisoner was dressd, and I did not observe any cut on either of his hands. On the following day, Monday, I went to the prisonery' house according to appointment. They lived in Four Acre-street, Lambetb, No. 4. I knocked at the door repeatedly, but could not get any answer, and I could not hear any sound in the house for two or three hours, and I remained at the door all that time. I went away and returned about half-past 9 o'clock at night, and again knocked at tho door, but could not get any tiwer. I stopped more than An hour, and finding I could not make any one hear I went home. When I first went I observed that the shutters of the house were closed. On the follow. ing morning I went to the prisoners' house again, accom panied by my mother, about 1 o'clock in the day, and met te pnsoner, Iartha Bacon, at the corner of the street She had a book in her hand, and a half-sovereign, ad she said she was going to pay her rent. Mynotber asked her where she had been all the prevou nighr, and she said she had been in the house all night She also immediately aerwards aid tht some one had got into the house by the back window, and that a man had kIlled the two children and had cut her throat, and she sad she was going to pay her rent and tell her landlord whath ahappened. We a1 then went back to the prisoners' house, and tbeprlaonerunlocked the door and we went in. 'Upon gOing into the bak room on the ground floor I saw the 3ittle boy sitting in a chair with his throat cut by the side of the firep There was no fire i the grate. The boy was between three and four yewa olc, Ibeve. There w a quantlty of blood on the uoor, and the child's face was resting on the tble and, ap parently it was quite dead but I did not touch it. Mrs. Bacon then zepeated the statement she had made before, that some men had got in at the window and had done it. Iwas so shocked at the sight that I left the house immediately, and went to the houso of the male prisoner's brother. My mother and Mrs. Bacon 'rent to the police station. I did not see the male prisoner until after he came back froinmRelgate on the Wednsday morning, but I did not notice how he was dressed at that time. A few dayv afterwards my attention was caled to a pair of fustian trousers that the prisoner wore, and on the Friday, when the funeral took place, I examined them, and saw some spots on the les, apparently blood. The spots were on the inside of the right leg. I asked the prisoner how those spots of blood had come on his trousers, and he told me that he had cat his finger. I had observed the spots a vweek before the funeral, and I called the priBoners attention to them at the time, and he told me that he had cut his finger as he was carving the dinner on the Sunday after Chrlistmasday. He afterwards said that he had cut his fnger as he was cutting a piece of wood to light the fire. This was a day or two after the former conversation. He said that as he was cutting the wood the knife had slipped and he had cat the end of his finger. I did not notice that he had any cut upon his finger until the Friday after the murder. A shirt belonging to the male prisoner was shown to me the day before the funeral of the children, and I observed that there were two or three maRll syots of blood upon it; they were very small spots, as thongh the prisoner had cut himself while shaving. I had frequently seen pieces of cord in the prisoners' house, and I once saw a piece of cord tak-n out of the fireplace that appeared to have been burnt. The prisoners have been marred about seven yeaM rs. Bacon haa been in a lunatic asylum, and I and rmy mother fetched her from St. Luke's in the month of October before By PIr. SLaIG.-M Bacon appeared quite calm and composed when we met her on the Tuesday morning, and she appeared as though nothing particular had happened By Mr. MEoAX.-The prisoners wished me to go to theirhouse earlyontheMondaymorning, butlbadanenppement, and told them I could not go until 4 o'clock in the afernoon. Bacon told me he did not think his wife ought to be left alone all the week, and that was the reaon Iwas wised to be with her. Both myself and Bwon were ap. prehensive of what she might do. as she had been confined and been out of her mmd before, and he appeared to wish her not to be left by herself. There Were Eome things on the table before the child, but I did not obseere whether they were toys or not. The blood on the shirt appeared as though it had been occasioned by his cutting himself iu ehad pimples on his chin, and I have seen m e Ihad seen rs. Bacon previous to her writing teletter to the magistate that ha been referred to, but I am not aware that any one made a suggestion to her that she would be hanGed if she did not make such a Re-examined.-No particular time was mentioned for ray going to the prisoners' honse on the Monday By a Juror.-The prisoner, Mr Bacon, did not say at what hour the house was broken into. William IIenr Cooke, a police-constable of the L division, said,L%On Tusdy, the 30th of December, I was en duty at the poiioe-station at Kennington when the female prisoner,accompanied by a womannamed Payne,came thers, and the latter sad that she wished me to go to Four Acrestreet, as she thought something very serious had happened. I accompanied them to the prisoners' house, and a3 we were going along Ms. Bacon said that a person had g)t In at the window and cut her children's throats andher own as ell. W1hen we d ot to the house the female prisoner un. -locked the door with a key, And -we All three vent Into the back room, and I saw a little boy sitting ona chair with his tbroat out and quite dead, and there was a great deal of blood before him and aU over the room. I asked where the other child was, and Mrs. Payne said she was upstairs, and I went up and saw a little girl lying on the floor with her throat cut and quite dead. There was a child's bed in the room which appeared to have been slept in. but I did not observe any blood on it. Both the children had on their nightclothes Upon observinig the childrenL in this COndaitiOn Isaid to Mrs. -Bacon " This is a bed job,"1 and she repied "I did not do it- a mn tbac window and did it." I examined the window to which she referred, n the back parlcur, and ascertained that it was Ifastened, but not properly, although -sncident to prevent any one from opening it from the otside, and al the mlass of the window WaS sound. Iawarda went into the front beroom, ond thefrso lorkn swd tatesahe'mstnightdr lyieng on the bed, nearly al covered over with blood on the sleeves and on the front part of the neck, and there was a quantity of blood on the floor of the soom. While I was examwiting the house the female prisoner passedme, and wento a little box that waS oit therdrawers sine front room, and took out an envlope and said that she must send to her husband. The envelope was addressed to the male prMsoner, and It conatined a bLank sheet of paper thpeeneope wias addressed to her husband at Beigate, and the prisoner said that it was her husbsnd's writing. I then took the female prisoner to the poliee-station, and whens we got there she was detained by the acting inspector upon the charge of murdering the children. When she was told that this was the eharge against her she made no answer. She was taken before a magistrate the same afternoon, and remanded. I went on the same day again to the house, accemntanied by nr. Bushell, the surgeon, and I then saw three dives lying on the table in the room where the dead body of the aho was. Two of these knives had blood upon them, hut the thsrdpwas suite clean. (The witness produced the knives.) One of these knives appeared to have been recently sharpened. On the Wednesday morning I examined the sill of the iandow eprisoner had referred to, and T observedome dust upon it, which did not appear to have been disturbed in the slghtest manner, and there were no marks of footsteps on the ground under the windowv, which was quite soft and would have taken the impression of any foot tha had bceen there. On the 6th of January one of the female turnkeys of lIorsemonger-lane Gaol gave me a chemise upon which there wr sa good deal of blood. By Mr. SLMGH.-The polce-sthtion is nearly a mile from the prisoners' house. The female prisoner did not make the slightest obwervation when Mrs Pane said that something serious had happened. She did not utter a word until asked Mr Payne where she lived. The impression the prsoner's demeanour made upon me at the time was that she -was not in her right mind. I avoided asking her any questions on that acoount. I have seen her severa times sinoe, and I have formed the same opminon respecting her state of mind. She has never to my knowledge exhi. bited the slightest feeling in referenee to the dreadful transaction. By Kr. MFTcAM.-There was an apron lying in the back room on which a bloody knife appeared to have boen wiped, and the boyappeared to have been klled inthe roo n 'where the body was found. The other child aso appeared to have been killed in the upstairs room where the body vas found. There was a spot of blood upon the landing and also upon the top stair. and there was a smear of bloo on the door of the upstairs room. Some child's toys were upon the table in front of the little boy, and there were al-o several upon the floor. I went down to Reigate on t'e Twesday night to fetch the male prisoner, but I did not tell him what had taken place, as I had orders not to do so. I found he was at work at the address on the envelope. By Mr. BODxrN.-The prisoner wished particularly to Iknow what had happened at home. He had gone to bed, i and he was aroused and gotup and dressed himself. When he came down I asked him if he had not got an aunt named Payne, and he said " Yes." I was in plain clothes. I told him that his wife was very ill, and that his aunt had sent ine to fetch him home. He particularly wished me t tell him what was the matter, and exclaimed, " Whatever can it be?' veral times. I had orders notto tell hiu whthad happened, and very little passed between us on our way back to London. The prisoner wal with me fron Reigate to the station at Red-hill, and we left there at 10 miutes to 4 in the morning by the mail tnm He did not at any tims ask me who I ws, or what wathe ocaWon of roy oming to fetch him, and we did not exchange a woid together after we got into the tnin. Thomas Oton, another roliee-eonstable, aid,-I a mcomPanied the last wvitness adlr, Buaheli, the sureon, to tte psoner' house, And found the bloody n hItres that hxs bn nrodced. In the chamber utensil t was uder th be t herappeared to be some blood. e By Mr. 1TOALPJ-I did not wee any basin that appered to contai water in which bloody hands had bewu washed. Mms Emma Lugt,ide eaid,-I am theo matron at the Horseinonger-lane aol nd received the female roner inom he I observed a wound on her throat which itpeared to have been dressed nd thero was plaster upon it On the following day I obierved that there was a uark sll round her neck, as though a eting had been tied tightly round it. I think this mark must have been caseud by a large cord. There was nothing zbout her dre that eould bave caased the mark. I called the attsntion of Mr. Harris, the surgeon of the gaol, to it, aDd the prisoner said that it was done with a kaife, tho same as her throat was cut With. The mark was much broader behind than in front. I dia. covered that the shift wom by the prisoner was bloody, and I handed it to the policem Ihe prisoner was not left alone at any time while she was in the prison. Amelia Oakes, the female earcher at the police-station in Kenniagton-lane, said,-I setrched the female prisoner on the 30t of December, after she was taken into custody. While I was doing so she asAd, "A man got in at the wifndow and murdred my two children and cut my throt a weL" She then said, "W ill they lock me up?" She was undressed at this time, a Ioldbrto putdher clothes on. I had ascertained thatthere was blood onher underclothing There were spots and stains all over it Thero was no appearance of blood upon her outer arments By Mr. SLGEE-She made this statement quite volun. t.%, and I did not put any questionswhatever to her. At this stage oo theehe Court was adjourned, in order that the jury might take some refreshment, and in about 20 minutes the trial was resumed. Mr. John Bashell said -lam a surgeon, and reside in Low,er Rennington-lane. I was sent for to the police-station on the 29th of December, and saw the female prisoner there. I asked her how she was, and she replied "Very poorly," and'then said that a man had got in at the window and out her throat and her children's also. I examined her throat, andc found several marik of cuts upon it, one from the lower pert extending from the Ieft to the right, two or three inches long, over the windpipe, but not touching it There vwa another cut from this downwards about two inches long, and several others that appeared to have beenout backwards aid forwards, and all above the first one. AU these cuts seemed to Isave been made indifferently from left to right and from right to let, and many of them vere mere abradons of the slin. The principal one waz that which ptsaed over the windpipe, and this was rather more thaa an eighth of an inch deep. The windpipe was not at aU injured, and the woundw in ever respt slight, but It hadbled, and so had aso the othier slighter cuts. The prisoner might have inflicted the whole of these wounds uponherself. If theyhadbeencausedbyanyotherperson the prisoner must havre been quite pasive and aesenting to what was done. I remarked to the prisoner that the wounds must have been inflicted some time, and she replied, " Yes, 8 o'clock lat night." I examined her hands, and found tbat the left one was of a brown colour, as ffrom stanz of blood that had only been partially waahed oflf The nails wtre stained of a sill deeper colour. The nails of theright hand were also partially stained in a simil rmanner. I then proceeded to the house of the prisoners, where I saw the dead bodies of the two children. The throats of both were cut, and the injurles were very likely to have been produced by such an instrument As the knife that has been produced. I observed it upon the table at the time, and I noticed that it had been wiped, and I have no doubt that there were still remains of human bloodnupon it, andI am also of opinion that it hd boen recentlyrubbed upon a steel. I looked at the windowr in- the lower room, andc am of opinion that it was fastened in such a manner as to have prevented any one from getting into the room by it. I exa mined the linen that was found in the bedroom, and I am of opinion that the blood upon the lower part of it could not Ave flowed from the vounds on the neck of the female prisoner, but that it had been rubbed off from somo other object. A pair of moleskin trousers wrere shown to me, and I observed marks of blood npon them in front. Ipector Young also showred me a wastot, on the collar of which,| there wnasa marlc of blood. By Mr. SL=GH.-1 have given the subject of insnity Y attention in the course of my profession;a experience, and at asWre that there is a form of inanity which ia known as homicidal nia. When I first saw the female prisoner I formed the opinion that she was not conscious o the act that had been committed She appeared quite indifferent. The LoB COF JusucE.-Do you mean by that that you do not think she was in her right mind I Witues-I do, my Lord. By Mir. MzwAua-In my opinion the children when I saw them had been dead for 24 hours. When I was first examined I Eaid that I thonght they had been dead up wards of 24 houmr I did not examine the trouers unt morn than three weeks afte the male prisoner was in custody, and I ahould not like to pledge myself positively that the stains upon them are blood. There areavarietyof things that would present the appearance of blood after a certain time had elapsed. Mr. Harris, the surgeon of Horsemonger.hnS Gaol, said, -I saw the female prisoner on the 31st of December, in the prison, bad my attention was called to some marlk upon her throat, and also to one in particular that appeamd to have been made by a coxd or string. I do not think the mark was such as would bave been occasioned by hanging-it was too regnlar. The cord must have been tied tight to occasion the mark in question. I asked her who had done it, and she said that a man had tried tocut her throat. Aipiece of cord has since been shown me which I thiak might have occasioned the mark in the neck By Mr. SLMGIL-Wheu I first saw the prioner I thonuht she was a person of unsound mind By Mr. MATCxax-My impression was that she had iDflicted all the injuries upon herself. Mary Sergeant said,-I lived next door to the prisoners, in Four Acre-street. I heard of this affair on the Tuesday morning about 12 o'clock. I had seen Mr. Baon on the previous Sunday. He and his wife went out together on the afternoon of that day, and I never saw them again until this discovery took place. I was sweeping before my own door on the Monday morning, and my broom accdentally struck the sill of the door of the prisoner's house and made a-noise, and I heard the sound as of sore one coming to the door, but it was not opened, and the perdon, whoever it was, returned down the psge. I heard no other noise but that during the whole of the rest of the day. The prisoners' children used to cry very frequently, and ono of them was very fretful, but I did not hear any crying at all during the whole of Monday. By Ir. Mlgro=ys.A-At first I had the idea that when the prisoners went out on Sunday the man had one of the children in his arms. I am not now quite sure whether he had or not. By the LILOD CCFmx JusTic-I have sen Mr. Bacon frequently carry the child past my window, and he appeared always to act like an affectionate father. John Letchford said,-I live at No. 5, Four Acre-street, next door to the prisoners. I slept at home on Sunday night, the 28th of December. On the following morning about 6 o'clock, I heard the sound of the rocking of a child in a cradle in Bacon's house, but i did not hear any voices, I did not hear the children cry at any part of the Mondyr, but before that I had heard them cry almost every day. The baby, in particular, used to cry very frequently. ts Mary Pierson, who also lived in a house adjoining the one occupied by the prisonesr, roved that on the Monday evening between 9 and 10 o'clock she hoard the sound of aome person walking in the front room of the first floor of the prisoners' house. Tbe sound was like that of some one walking backwards and forwards in the room, and it continued for more than two minutes. William Hope, the landlord of No. 5, Four Acre-street, proved that he was at home the whole of Monday, the 29th of December, and that he did not hear the children of the prisoners cry during any part of the day. James Cook, the gaoler at Lambeth Police-court, said,The female prisoner was under my charge while under remand, aud produce a letter that was written in my presence by her. The L4RD CEmx SusTic said he felt It his duty to caution the jury that this letter was no evidence against the male prisoner, and ought not to prejudice him in any manner. Theletterreferred tobythelearned counselin his opening address was then put in and read. Examination continued.-She asked me for pen and paper, and I gave them to her, and she then wrote the ietter. No one was with her when she wrote it or commu. nicated with her in any manner. Some of her friends had been talking to her before she asked for the paper. I did not hear what they said to her. When she had written the letter she gave it to me, and I took her before the magistrate. I had previously told her that it was a very serons charge ahe was making against her husband, and I begged her not to make any statement that was not perfectly true, and to remember that the Almighty was look'ng down upon what she was doing. She replied that she was quite aware of that, and what she had written there was perfectly true, and she did not see why the innocent should suffer for the guilty. I afterwards delivered,the paper the prisoner had written to the magistrate, and he read it aloud. The male pisoner was not in the dock at this tine, but was standing in front of the dock, and when the letter had been road he was taken into custody and placed n the dock. I did nt near nun say anything when the paper was read. By Mr. M=vCAn&v.-Tho male prisoner appeared horror- struck at the charge, and would have fallen back and fainted if he had not been caught by me. Mr. E. Young, an inspector of the L division of police, said,-ITpon hearing of the murder I sent a polioeman to fetch Bacon from Reigate, and he was brought to me at tha police-tation in Kennington-lane. I told him that I had sent for him in consequenoe of something that had hasp pened to his wife. lie appeared very agitated and wanted to know what had occurred, and I broke it to him gentl that his wife had attempted to commit snicide. Heseemed much affected, and remarked that he knew three women whocame from tbesame place andhad goneinthesame way. I asked him what he meant, and he said, "H Had gone out of their mind." He then asked very anxionsly about the children, and I told him there was nothing particular the mater. He appeared very much distresed, and I w/as therefore cautious how I broke it to him; but I at length informed him that tha chiidren had been destroyed by his wife. He was then very aittad, and anious to go at once and see the children, and sent a onstable with him to the house. The prlsoner returned to the police-station with the coble about half-pest 6 in the morning, and he said he had not been able to see the children, but he had seen the blood of his dear boy. Oa the Saturday following I observed a cut on the prisoner's finger. Mrs. Bacon at this time had been examined before the magistrate and remanded for a week, and the coroner's inquest took place on Friday, the 2d of January. Bacon was premut, and, in consequenoe of something that had transptred about some property being missing from the house, Iaskedhimif it vwa true. and hesaidthat aome 0lotbts, & watcb, and 71. in money were msing He came to the police-station on tho following day and gave me a description of the articles that had hews stolen, anolg which was a greatcoat, a frokooat, and money to the amountof 'Ti,partof wrhich as a -note and tweo ioereins, and he said he h ad reeived the fiLnlote at the London and Westminster Bank, as part paymnent of a heck for 15R . that had been given him by r. Atto of Stamford. taed him for the name and number of the watch, aud after&agooddeal of hesitation he sa b e lhd bou&bkQ& ~atehof hisr brother James, who lived i ot square. He also told me that he had WOfln the Clotkimohne represented to have been stolen 0on the Sund bef th murder, and that he had hung them on a rai ;onr',ide thes bedroom door at night. I subsequentlyq ent to the pri Eonr'S brother and obtained the n=mber of the W at a deAcription of it was made piblic. The number of the watch was 82,798, and I have sinoe seen a watch bearing that number. On the 7th of Janary I for the Arit time Eaw a watch in the prisoners posesion, and he told me thAt he had been down to Stamford on the 4th I enquired of the prisoner wher hom watch wa, land he showed me the one I now prodace, the number ,r which is 13 663. I went to the prisoners house to make a search, and while I was so engaged Bacon came in and I told him I wa going to exAmine a cellar, and sent for a ca!ndle for the purpose, and whilo the candle was being fetched I heard a noise in the yard and upon going there Segeant Broad, one of my men, toid mo that the prisoner had put something into hii pocket, and I put my hand in and pulled out the watch numbered 136. In the course Ol he conversatons I had with the male prisoner he amube. quently said that he had received a 3SO. check, and that he 7was paid with four 55.-notes and ten sovereigns, and he said be had put every one of the notes in a box in his bedroom for afety, and thatthis was the one that was stolen ; and he said it was safe in the box when he went to Reiiate. I afteiwards mado inquiries, and told the prisoner that I had traced the whole of the notes that had been paid for the check, and I asked him for an eiplanation, and he then said that he had received another 51.-note from a person to whom he had given chaDge for it in the street. I have Bince traced that note aso. After the prisoner had given me the first descripion of the clothes he rteesented to have bee, stolen he told me that his clothes were all made by Mr. Dixon, a tailor at Stamford, and that he bad made clothes for him for 20 years. On the -id of January I ob. served a cut in onO of the prisner's fingers, but it appeared. to be graduall yheaing. It was upon the first joint of the first finger of his right haind, and he said he had done it while "whittling"a stick. He afterwards toldame that lie had ent himself while he was carving his dinner on the Sunday. He was very agitated when he said this. Iasked him if he had seen his wife before leaving home on the Monday morning, and he said he had left her in bed very comfortable, that he had kissed her, and that she had bound p his fLngertoprevent himfrom catching coldinit. Iwas at the pohee-oourt on the 2st of January, when the risoner Bacon was taken into custody, after the letter had been read thathis wife had written. While I wasentering the charge he addresed me andsaid, l"Oh,3Mr. Young, is it nio isho¢cking that she sbould sayI did it? But I don't c;re - f'the Lodwil eslpmthrough idt. MyJ poo bo3y, I couldy furthest." ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ o h B.* Mr. MxToArx.-~When I repeated this statement before the magistrate BaWon sobbed violently and ap very much aeted. Upon several other ocasions thrisober also manifested a great deal of emotion whenever the children were spoken of. The female prisoner appeared to take very littlenotie of anything that took place. Cook, the gaoler, was here recalled, and stated that after Bacon had been taken into custody he wrote a letter to his 'wfe intreating her to speak the trth and expressing the tmost affection for her. Mr. W. Payne said,-I ams an engineer, and reside at Mfile-end. dy wife is related to the male prisoner, and I remember eenmg him and his wife at the house of Mr. James Payne on Sunday, the 28th of December. I did not observe thUt he hbd any cut on his finger on that day, but I ob. setved that he had one after the inquest, and I asked him hdw it was cut, and he said, it was by cutting a piece of meat. I told him I thought it was lona by sharpening a Ife on a steel, and he said that his were new kives, and id not want any sharpening. After he returned from 3itigate he came to my rooma, and, aaaressing my wife said, "Aunt, how did this happen?" And I said, "Your wife has murdered the two children." Ile replied that he did not believe it, and he wanted to know the trath ; and he sad he oould not believe that she had done it. J told hinm I conld not believe that any one went In and murdered those two children- and he sid again he would not believe that hiA wife had doneit. I then toldhim that no one could go ir at the door, and askod if he had left the key in the door, and he saidhe had not, but that he had taken it out as was his common practice, and hnng it behind the door. About a week after this he told me that he had lost money a greatcoat, and a suit of clothes, and I asked hin who nia made the ooat, and whether it was made by Dixon, of Stamford, and he said, no, he had taken it for a debt, but he could tell me from whom he had received it, and I told him I believed that whathe was saying was ad false. He also told me that he had lost a atch, and I replied that I did not believe it. The watch now produced, number 32798, is the one that the prisoner was in the haibit of wearing, and he had it with him when became back from Reigte. After he had been to Stmford I saw that he had another watch, tie number of which was 1I363. On Sunm day, the 28th of December, both the prisoners were at my house, and I asked the female prisoner how she corld leave ber two ohildren alone in an empty house, and she replied, "Uncle, don't you fret about the children, they are happy enough." I notioed that Bacon himself seemed verTy agtated on this occasion. The night before the prisoner was taken into custody I had some conversation with hilm, in tho course of which I aid to him, " Thomas, how would you fare if your vdfe were to turn round upon you tomorrow and say you did it?' He replied, " 1y wife never did deceive me, and she will not do so now." I replied that was mnore 'than he could teLL My wife came in at the time, axA Bacon asked her if she had ever deceived me, and she replied that was her busineu. (A laugh.) I had no oDmmnualoaton with the prisoner's wife to induce her to make the shtement charging him with the crime. By Mr. 31ZTCMZ.-I h said to the prisoner that I did not'behseve anyone would have gone in and committed the murders without robbing the house, and it was a day or two' afterwards that he told me he had lost the money and Mrs. Payne, wife of the last witness, confimed the evidenoe given by him a to what took place on the 28th of December. She also proved that she accompauied her daughter Mr Munro to the prisoner's house on the Taesday following, and she corroborated her evidence as to what occurred upon that occsion, and said that the beds on whicb the children usually slept appeared to have been made after they were slept in, By Mr. SLxroH-After the birth of the last child the mind of Mrs. Bacon was very much affected, and she was occaionally very violent. She suffered very severely during her oonfinement and after the birth of her child she was very strange in ner manner, and wssometimes under delusions, and the had threatened the lives of her nearest and dearest relatives. She wras confined ittSt. Luke's from the month of June till the 17th of October last year. She always manifested gre^at kindness and fondness for her children. By Mr. METcA.y.-When she awSA the prisoner orn the Tuesdvay morning she asked her wAhy she did not let Harriet in on the night before, and she replied that she had been oot walkig wilth the children and thought she should hav met her. Bacn alwAays appeared very fond of his wife, and he visited her while she was int the asylum, and upon one occasion he wAas allowed to take her out wAith himn. Hie had also continued to express himself kindly and affectionatelyI towards her since this charge had been meade against him. Witness wrsstn thegaolef'sroomwi rs.h Bacon On the day; 'whenA she made the charge against her husband, but she was not awrare that any inducement was held out to her to, Matilda LawArence proved that her child gave hers watch, which she h-ad picked ue in George-street, WaiwAorib, The w^atch wvas wrapped up 1PA a piece of paper, and turwned out to be the one that the prisoner Bacon represented to have SergeaAnt Broad, of the 1 division, proved that on the 7th of JaAnuary he went to Btacon's house, and he heazdl Inpector Young ask him to describe the watch that he had lost, and he said It was one that he had' bought of his brother James. The watch numbered 13,663 was ast this time in his posse- sian, and hesaidhe ha boutght itof Mr.Jackson. of Spilahy.I AL fewr days after this he was engaged, with Mlr. Young, in maig a mere complete search of the houAse in Fonrace street. While so engaged Bacon came in, and when Mr. Young propoe to examine the coal cellar he sAid it had been looked into. While a candle wsbeing fetohedBacon wvent into the cellar, and witness told him to comAe out, and waitttill they had got a candle, and he came out and afterwards went in again. Witness got a light and went into the cellar, and he there.saw the prisoner on his knes apparently in the act of putting his hand under the flooring. ilnes asked him what he was doing, and he got up, and caught hold, in so doing, of some hay and straw that was in the cellar, and then went into the yard and threwr awray the strawv, and then put his hand into his pock:et. He called the attention of Mr. Young to what the prisoner had been doing, and he saw him take the watch numbered 13663 from the prisoner's pocket. A clerk from the London and Westminster Bank and some other w/itnesses were then examined, and they proved that the notes the prisoner had received for the checkhe had referred to wrere all traced to him.e Samuel Perry deposed that he was engaed with the pi soner upon a job *t Reigate on Mlonday, the 29th of Decem. her, and that thne prisoner appeared totally unable to do h7s work, and that he threw down his tools and appeared in a miost excited state, and not to knowr what he was doine, and freqnently sat down for a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes, Wparently deep in thought. Henry ard, another workman, gave similar evidence. He saiW that the prisoner came backwards and forwards to the shop every half-hour, aDd. did not seem to know what he was about, ortobe able to get on with his work. Mr. Dixon, a tailor of Stamford, deposed that be had be'n in the habit of making clothea for the prisoner for severalyears, and on the 4th of January he came to him And asked if he recollected having made him a greatcoat. Witness told him he did not, and the prsoner then told him it was a dark one. Hle still told him be did not recollect having made such a coat, and he then said that it had been stolen and witness would be sent for to London, and it would do him a great servioe and would do witness no harm if he stated that he hbd made a coat of such a desription for him. He said this several times, and his manner was very strange. He was at the rawray station when Bacon left in the after- noon, And he several times said he hoped he would do what he had requested, and he trembled very much. He also said he 'was sure that witness would be sent for to London, and he saked him not to tell anybody what he had said. Witnees never made him such a coat as the one described, Crom-examined.-The prisoner showed him the portraits of his children, and exclanmed, "Who could have thought she would have done it?" He was in a very excited state. Anne Hyde, a charwoman, proved that she washed the risoner Bacon's linen, and found blood upon it, and that n said, in answer to her inquiries how it came there, that it ras from piles. Witness was certain this wag not the csaa. After Mrs. Bacon had been, exanined. the prisoner appeared very nervous And frightened, and said he hoped his wife would not be hurt, and he said he would kll her it she said anything about it.

APPEAL. HOUSE OF LOBLDS. MAY 13. T2I SaREWSBURJY AND BIRiINGHAM RAILWAY COM- PANY V. THE LONDON AND NORTH-WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY AND TiHE SH.ROPSHIRE UNION RAILWAYS AND CANAL COMPANY. Their Lordships sat this morning to deliver judgment ia this appeal from the decision of the Court of Chancery. It appeared that in 1849 the London and North-Western Bailway Company were desirous of obtaining an Act of Par. liameat empowerig them to take a lease of the Shropshire Union Railway and Canal Company's lines which run from Shrewsbury through Wellington to Stafford. The first part of the line-namely, that from Shrewsbury to Wellington wV- common to the Shropshire Union anac th aelliantso AtWellington the two lines diverge, the appeliantsl w proczeding to Wolverhampton, where it joins the Birainsham, Wolverhampton, and Stour Valley ltailway, and the Sropshire Union proceeding to Stafford and joining the London and North-Western line. Besides the liae from shrewsbury to Stafford the Shropshire Union Comi fay had power under their Acts to make two other es, which,however, had been abandoned. It was feared by the appeslants that if the North-Western Company obtained possession of the Shropshire Union line they would npproprsate all the traffic which had up to that time belonged to the appellants, and they therefore opposed the BilL Under these circumt-tances an agreement was entered into between the appellants and the respondents that an wccount should be kept bv both compares of the traffic between Shrewsbury or iVellington and Rugby, and that the amount so received should be divided into 13ths, of which the eppellants were to have seven. This agreemnent was to be terminable at the option of the appellants. The respondents having obtained their leasing Act, entered into possession of the Shzopshire Unon line, but refased to make out any accoant of tho traffic as had beea stipulated in the agreement, alleging that the time for enforocng that agreement had not nrrived, inasmuch as it was only to come into operation when they were in possession of the whole undertaking of the Shropahire Union Company, and there were then two line3 which had not been commenced. They also alleged that they had no power to make such an agreement, and that therefore it was void. Under these circumstances the appellants filed their bill in Chancery, in December, 1849, to onforca tho agreement. The respondents demarred to the bill, and their demurrers were allowed, and the appellants' motion for an injunction was dismissed with costs. The appellants then appealed to Lord Cottenham, the then Lord hnucellor, who wras of opinion that the agreement had _ome into operation and thatit was a valid agreemient, and he reversed this decision. An inianction was accordingly pranted until the respondents put in their answer m May, 18O50. The injunction was then dissolved, and the appellants were allowed to bring an action to try tho validity and alleged breach of the agreement. An action was accordingly brought in the Court of Queen's Bench, and that Court decided upon demurrer that the agreement was legaL The cause was subsequently transferred to the Master of the Rolls, who dismissed the bill vithout costs. The appellants appealed to the Lords Justices from this decree, and in June, 18153, judement was given, dismissing the appeal without costs. 1'rori that judgment the present appeal was brought. The case was argued last session, when the further consideration was adjomuned sine die. The LORD CHANCELLOR, in giving judgment, said that in his opinion the decision of the Master of the Rolls was correct, and that this appeal must be dismissed with costs, on the ground that thc time for enforcing the agreement had not arrived. Looking at the counstruction of the LeaSng Act and the agreement, it was clear that the latter did not come into effect until the whole undertaking of the Shropshire Union Company had been completed, and was in the possession of the respondents. It would be unnecessary for their Lordships to decide any other ints in the case, but it certainly appeared to him (the ord Chancellor) that the agreement was ldvra vires, as it was a contract for another purpose than carrying on their business as a railway company. It also seemed in his sight to be illegal, because the appellants alone could enforce it whenever they chose, and thus it was one sided. Appeal dissmissed with costs.
LvAW REPORT. COURT OF QUEENS BENCH. GUrLnrTAT.T MAPA 1l RIDEfEI. V. SALISBURY. (Sitings at Niii Prius, before Mr. Justice COLERIDGE and Common Juries.) Mr. Overend, Q.C., and ir. Tap ping appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Charnock for the aefendant. The plaintiff in this action, Mary Ann Rideer, sued the defendant to recover damages for an assault and false imprisonment, and also in detenue, for the detention of a bottomry bond and for money due. The defendant pleaded the general issue, a justification of the imprisonment, on the ground that the plaintiff was making a disturbance in his nouse, and payment. From the plaintiffs evidence it appeared that she was a single woman, who had gone out to the Cape of Good Hope while yet a ohild, and remained there in service for several years, til the year 1851, when she Bailed in the ashp of a Captain Ramsden to Melbourne, In Austraha. She had saved up some money at the Cape, and at Melbourne she kept a lodginghouse till the end of 1854, by which time she had saved 7001. and upwards. She then saied for England in Captain Ramsden's ship. The vessel encountered bad weather on the voyage, and put into the Mauritius for repairs. The plaintiff was induced to advance the captain as much as 4001. to 5001., and on their arrival in England, in May, 1855, sonne further repairs became necessary, and she advanced a further sum, which made the total advanced upon account of the ship 7001. This was secutred by by a bottomry bond, executed by Captain Ramsden, who was not only captain, but part owner. The plaintiff, in September, 18,'6, wanted to get back her money. and, through Captain Ramsden, she was introduced to the defendant, Henry Salisbury, who managed his father's business as a sail-maker and ship-chandler, in the West India Dock-road. The defendant, Salisbury, who had transactions with ILamsden, was willing to take the assignment, and for this purpose the parties attended, on the 1st of October, 185, at the offies of Mr. Harrison, a notary, in the city. The plaintiff then executed the assignment by affixing her mark; and the receipt of the 7001. was acknowledged in the same way. Mr. Harrison then asked Salisbury for the money, but he excused himself, on the ground that " he had forgotten his checkbook.' Mr. Harrisor5 then gave the bond and assignment back to the plamtiff; and, moording to her statement, while Mr. Harrison was out of the room for four or five minutes, and while she was putting the papers in her pocket, Salisbury took them from her, saying he would give her them back again. The plaintiff said she required Salisbury either to give her the bond back or the money. They then left the offlce, Salisbury teling her that if she would go with him to his house he would give ber the Inoney. The parties then went together to the Flower Pot, and soon after leavingthat place Salisbury feU in with an acquaintance, and lex the plaintiff, teUing her it was too late that day, as it was after banking hours, and she must oaU UpOn him next morning and she should have the money. He said he was a " gontleman," and she mighttake his " word of honour" that he would pay her the money. She was then indueed to trust him, but when she called upon him the next day she found he had not been home all night, and when she called upon him the day after he was in bed in the parlour tipsy, and she could get neither her bond nor the moDey. From that time she had appled to him a hundred times or more to have her bond or the money, but he had always put her off with promises, which he never fulfilled. This went on till the I 1th of Ootober, 1856, when the plaintiff called upon the dofendant (Salisbury) and insisted upon having her monev. The defendant then laughed at her, and pushed her out of the shop, bat she insisted on going in again, and sat down in the parlonr, and would not go away until the defendant sent for a polioeman and gave her intocustody. The plaintiff was then taken to the station, bat she was discharged on her promise not to create any further disturbance. At this stage of the case Mr. Serjeant SHEE called the attention of the Court to the assignment and receipt vhich acknowledged the receipt of the 7001. by the plaintiff, and contended that the plaintiff could not be allowed to reontradict her own deed. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE said the case must go on. The case then proceeded, and the plaintiff was crossexamined as to the manner in which she became possessed of so large a sum as 7001. She said she had saved it out of what she had earned. Since her arrival in England she had been living in the same house with Captain Rainsden, but not as his wife. The bond, it appeared, was put in suit by g> the defendant, and the ship sold in the early part of 1856 for 1,1701., but neither the plaintiff nor Captain Ramsden had taken any steps to prevent the defendant from recover. iDg his share of the proceeds. The plaintiff swore most distinctly that she had never received one shilling from the The plaintiff's little girl, aged 14, confirmed her mother's Etory in part, as to her asking the defendant eitber to give her back the bond or the money on the 1st of October; and she also denied that her mother had passed as Captain Ramsden's vwife. Captain Ramsden confirmed the plaintiff's evidence, and sald he was with the plaintiff and defendant at the Flower Pot, on the Ist of October, and heard them " jawing about the bond." He also called on defendant the day after, and asked him why he did not either give her the money or the bond, when the defendant said he would make it all right. He complained to him on a hundred other occasions on the same ground; but, though he always said he would pay the money, he never did. This witness was cross-examined at sOme length, and, after a good deal of reluctance, admitted that he had been living with the plaintiff as his wife. At first he sad he should be a fool "*to kiss and tell," but being told by the learned judge that he was bound to answer the question he confessed. This witness accused the defendant with being a great swindler, and said he had got from him a second bond for 2501. on the ship to pay for some repairs, but that he had not paid the creditor. Mr. Harrison, the notary, proved the execution of the assignment by the plaintiff. He then said to the defendant, 'Now, lr. abury, your money," upon which the defendantsaid, "he had left his check-book behind him." The witness then gave the assignment bick to the plaintiff, who, as he thought, put it into her pocket. Salisbury paid the expenses, and the witness heard no more of the matter till recently, though in December, 1855, the second bond was executed by Captain Ramsden to the defendant in his (witness's) office. A policeman was then called, and stated that he was sent for by the defendant, and told to take the plaintiff into custody. She was at the time sitting in the parlour. She got up, and, issing some foul language, struck at the defendant's mother. She then went outside the shop, and made such a disturbance that a large orowd collected. The defendant then said he could stand it no longer, and ordered the policeman to take her into custody. The plaintiff then walked quietly, but in custody, to the polne station, bat was discharged on giving a ptomiso to make no more distuxbai,co Mr. Ses1eant}SnEsad heshould prove that the agreement was that the defendant was to pay 6001. for the assignment, and that the money was actually paid on the same day at the defend e ho>, The lesa~ed. ?erneaot then called, the eefendaut, who stated that he had alwasa known the dintiff as Mrs. Ramsden and the wife of Captain Rams- e It was agreed that he was to pay only 600L, thoough it was expressed upon the faoe of the assignment that the consideration was 7001. He pcsitively declaed that the plaintiff had accompanied him home the same afternoon, on the lst of October, 1855, and that he paid her 6001. in gold and notes in his parlour, and she then gave him the assignmeit. He denied tbat there had heen any wrangling about the bond at the Flower Pot or elsewhere, or that the plaintiff had made any demand upon him what ever in respect of the bond until a short time before she came and maAe the disturbance in October, 1856. The defendant also positively contradicted the evidence given by Captain Ramsden, and retaliated his charges of fraud. He also denied that he had touched the plaintiff when she came to his house, but he said her con. duct and language were most outrageous and disgusting. The defendant, en cross-examination, denied that he had ever used the expression to Mr. Harrison that " he had forgotten his checkbook ;" but he would not swear that he had not used the expression, though, if he had, it was not true for he never had any banking account. He said he hadpaid the plaintiff the 6001. in gold and notes, which he kept in a box in his parlour, and the money was the result of l4years' saviqa, ;with the exception of 1501. borroweed of his father and 1o01. borrowed of his brother. The. defendant said he kept no books and made no entry of the transaction, and excused this omission by saying that he could only write well enough to write his name. The defendant's wife proved that her husband had a considerable sum of money in his money-box about the time in question, and she, as well as the defendant's sister, stated that about the begin. ning of October, 1855, the plaintiff came to her house and stayed in the parlour about an hour. When she was gone the defendant showed his wife the bond. The defendant's father and brother also proved their having each lent him a sum of 1501. about the same time, though they contradicted the defendant as to his inability to write. The trial of this cause occupied the Court the whole of the day till a late hour; and eventually the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 7001. odd.

The liat contains the entry of 21 causes, of which three, marked as special jury causes, are made remanets. Six or eight of the others have been struck out. THORBURN V. MEALLIN. This was an action to recover 150., the price of a quantity of ale sold by the plaintiff to the defendant for bottling and exportation, according to sample and warranted bright. Some of the ale on bottlin turned out to be cloudy rioked, and woody. The defendant bottled about 300 aozen, and the rest not being fit for bottling refused to pay for it. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for the whole amount caimed. Mr. Serieanut Ballantine and MIr. H. James appeared for the plainiff, and Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Joyce for the defendant. The rest of the day was occupied with trying an action for an excessive distres, interesting only to the parties.
COURT OF EXCrTROYM.n. W- - v. -IO OVF.Iznn%- IV -- (SWings at lVis! Prius, before Mr. Baron wkMA iN, at OW&LItdhniL Mr. dvdwin James, Mr. Joseph Brown, and Mr. Joyce were connsel for the plaintiff. Mr M. COhanbes and Mr. Unthank appeared for the detendant. This was an action to recover compensation for injuries alleged to have been sustained by the house of the plaintiff in consequence of certain works, alterations, and bauildings carried on upon the adjoining premises under the direction of the defendant. After the cause had progressed but a short way the learned counsel stated that their respective clients had met each other in the fairest and most liberal spirit, and had areedthat a verdict should be taken for the plaintiff for 8001. Hi3 LORDSHIP expressed his satisfaction at this arrangement,and thereupon a verdict was taken for the plaintiff for 3001. GREGORY V. BOWES. Mr. Serjeant Parry and Mr. F. Smith appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Hoggins and Mr. Hodgson represented the defendant. This was an action to recover 681. 19s. 4d., as the agreed price of certain brass, at 9id. per pound, in answer to which the defendant paid 591. 19s. 6d. into court, on tho ground that the bargain was at 8Wd. per pound. The question therefore was whether the plaintiff was entitled to the difference, and this the jury solved in favour of the plai. tiff. Verdict for the plaintiff accordingly. PRODSHAS V. CROSS. Mr. Edwin James and MIr. Phipson were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Wilkinson appeared for the defendant. It appeared that the plaintiff, who is a lady, had taken in 1854 a furmished house in Connaught-terrace, with the view of takinglodgers. Among these was tho defendant, who was residing in the house when the plaintiff received an appointment to go to the Crimea as a lady nurse. On her departure the plaintiff deposited 351. with the defendant to Fay her rent, and also intrusted him with her plate and inen and a few articles of furniture,with the object of their being forwarded to her sister at Liverpool. When Mrs. Frodsham returned from the Crimea she ascertained that the rent had not been paid, nor had the furniture reached her sister. After some delay she traced the defendant to Berkhampstead, and at an interview with that gentleran, conducted by a polceman and her attorney, on her Ibalalf, somn of the articles were returned; but others, worth 181. 9s. 6d., were, as well as the rent, unaccounted for by the defendant, whereupon this action was brought. The sister and landlord corroborated this story, the latter stating that, instead of getting any rent when he applied to the defendant for it, he was obliged to pay him 81. which he claimed on behalf of the tenant before he could get possession of the house. The defendant not being caJled to ex. plain his conduct, The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for 531. 9s. 6d. THE IMPROVEMENTS AT GUILDRALL. We are hapy to have it in our power to record the anqualified appro ation expressed by the gentlemen of the bar o the alteraions recently effected by the corporation in their courts. Instead of the gloomy, ill-ventilated inconvenient, and almost unapproachable closet, a light, oommodious, and easily accessible robing-roomand reading room to boot hav been provided,-alterations which have not been attained at any sacrifice of the space aUotted to either of the courts, but have rather been introductory of improvements in the hall and the general arrangemerits of the Courts of Queen's Bench and Commoni Pleas. Two additional courts have also been constructed in the buildings near to the Guildball and this court, which will be found very useful when double Courts are sitting. With respect to the arrangement of these new courts, there is much to approve of; but we should say that if a barrister had been consulted he would have recommended the Bar to be located in a position to and from which there would be free access and retreat. At present these seats are placed in one of the courts at the extreme further corner, and in the other the plan is little, if at al, better. We fear that when the dog-days come these build ings will be found to be insufferably hot, as they are lighted from lanterns only. The aathorities and officials must therefore take care and "raise the wind" in A--rnod
EXCHEQUER CTA% WrRR W r.- SCOTT V. TIIE MVAYOR. -C.. f'P MA ,- ({ettngs in Error.-Present-17e Lord COkief Just*e COCR- C.DI , and Justices WicHTT, ERE CROzPTON, CRWER. and WTT..Pq A=s was a writ of error upon a judgment on a dem=rrer to a plea in the Court of Excheqner The declaration alleged that the defendants were doing work in respect of some gas-fittings in a certain street in Manchester, and that they did this by their workmen in so negligent a manner that the plaintiff sustained considerable injury. The defendants pleaded among other pleas that the grievances were bondflde done in the course of the exeeution of certain powers given to them by Act of Parliament, and without the neglect of the defendants or their workmen - that the workmen employed by them were well skilled and qualified, and were proper persons to be employed, but this plea upon discussion was held to be albad plea. It was found that the workmen had acted negligently. Mr. HUGH HILL now appeared for the defendants, and contended for two propositions-that the defendants were trustees for a public purpose acting in the execution of the Act of Parliament, deriving no personal benefit for this purpose, and were merely acting in discharge of a pblic duty; and, secondly, that if they were so acting they were not responsible for the consequences of acts done with. in the scope of their authority; to make them liable they must have acted either in excess or abuse of their antho&.ity, and were not responsible for the negligence of the persons they employed, those persons being competent persons. Mr. ATHERTON was heard on the other side. The judgment was affirmed.
ADMIRALTY COURT. WxrnuA Mv IQ THE FIREFLY.-SALVA'. (Bcfore Dr. LuSuD;GTON.) xnis was a suit promoted by the steamtugs Pilot and Gipsy King to obtain salvage remuneration for services rendered to the Firefly, a screw steamer, on a dangerous shoal called the Stone Heads, near Sunderland, on the 3d of December last. The Pilob alleged that while moored in the sea outlet of the Sanderland South Docks she heard a bell ringing loudly, upon which she put out to sea, and found the Firefly in a state of great distress, with two tugs-the Gipsy King and the Gently-ineffectually attempting to tow her off the shoal. The services of the Pilot were engaged, and, in conjunction with the other tugs, towed her frst into deep water, and then proceeded to conduct h4r to Shields. The Gently having become disabled, she was obliged to discontinue her services, but the Pilot and Gipsy King succeeded in getting the Firefly into port. On the part of the owners It was alleged that there was a verbal agreement thateachvessel was to receive201. for her services, but this was denied by the salvors. A tender was made of 40L which the salvors refused. The value of the property salved was 7,5001. Dr. BAYFORD and Dr. DEANE were heard for the salyors; Dr. ADAmsS and Dr. SWABEY for the owners. The learned JUDGE considered that the fact of the ree. ment was proved ; with regard to its equity, it might ~ hard bargain, but it was not one which the Court ought to set aside. He mnust therefore pronounce for the tender, and of necessity with costs. THE MkARGARZT.-SAIVAGE This was a suit instituted by the steamtug Constitution. against the bark Margaret to obtain salvage remuneration for services rendered to her near Beaumarls on the 24th of January last. The bark, laden with provisions, was proceeding from Queenstown to Liverpool, but in consequence of the tempestuous weather determined to take shelter in Beaumaris Bay, When under the lee of Puffin Island, according to the statement of the salvors, she became becalmed, and touched on the spit of the Dutchman Bank. The tide soon set her offthe bank, with the los of one of her anchors, and shortly afteirwaxs siso hoied a sijual of distress, The 6teamer went to her aid and conducted her safely into Friar'sOds a distance of a tthree miles, whenoa she was afterwards taken by another atenmtig to LivcrpooL On the part of the oWners it was contended that the slgna wrs only for a nBoi orfor a toott conduct her into the bay. The service filotrfora boatth lasred two houa. tender was made of i001,, which the Ealvors rejected. The value of the property salved waa 3,5651, Dr. BAYFOIRD and Dr. Twrss were heard for the salvors; Dr. ADDna?aS and Dr. SPneBS for the owners. The learned JuDG1x was of opinion that the bark was in a very dangerous position, from which she could only have been rescued by a steamer. The tender was insufficient, nd he must therefore overrule it and decree 250I. THE ELIZA.-SLVAE. This was an action brought by the ateamituga Independence and Enterprise against the 8hib Eliza to proourea salvage reward for services rendered to her in the river Mersey on the 23d of January last. A second action was entered by the steantug Ayrshire I,assie. The Eliza, of the burden of 1,449 tons, was bound from Baltimore to Liverpool, laden principally with flour. She was anchored in that part of the river called the Sloyne, and on the day in question the wind camae on to blow heavily from the northward and westward, and the starboard chain narted. A second anchor was immediately let go, but she diove foul of the Sardin, started her from her anchor, and both vessels, each with an anchor down drove together up the river, and the Elir ultimately etrock broadaide on the Devil's Bank. The various gtoamvessels, seeing, as they represented, her perilous position, procaeded to her assitance, and, after a number of ineffeotual efforta, succeeding in dragging her off the bank. On the part of the owners it was alleged that neither of the steamntugs incurred the slightest risk in rendering the service; that the Elsza was not in the least danger of breaing her back ;h and that the usual price paid for the largest steantugs employed in such services was 21 l0s. per hour, or 25 gnas -tide. The value of the property salved was 40,O 0001a Dr. BAyyoRD and Dr. Twrs were heard for the Indlependence, and the Enterpuse ; Dr. TPwae f or the Ayrshire ae; Dr. ADDA-SS and Dr. DASENT for the owners. The learned JUDGE said that he thought it necesay to say, in conseqnence of erroneous notions which seemed to be entertainea by some persons as to services performed by steamiers, that in these cases the Court looked to the value of theproperty salved, the danger to which it was exposed, the efciency with which the services were performed, the strength of the vessels by which those services wero discharged, and the value of the property so engaged. It wjs of great importance to the maercantile interests of this country that there should be large steamers, both in the river Thames and the river 31ersey, engaged at one time in salvage and at another in towage services, and that their owners should obtain a suffdicent remuneration. Looldng at all the circumstances, he did not think he should give an extravagant award if he gave to the Independence and tho Enterprise 4001. each, andtothe Ayrsbire Lassie, which was of less power and efflciency, 200. with costs.

It appeaed that in January, 1856, Harvey, being just of sgeh, haaaum of 301. advauced him by his father to join ailey in the above business. The father also lent the firm a sum of 5001. The bankrupte debts are now 5,400., the assets being about 1,0001. Biley had many years carried on business, and his character and credit stood high. During the partnership, which it was now shown com. menced with a deficiency of 2,400., Bailey had, to use tlie words of the learned Commissioner, " helped hinself out of the til to the amount of 1,50W." Hehas failed to surrender to the bankruptcy, and it was stated that prior to leaving the country he had sought an interview with Mr. Harvey, sen., when hosaidthat "*he had swindled him and his son." His HoNou.-He was an accomplished swindler. The young mnan who had the misfortune to become his partner may take a certificate of the second class IN RE LEOPOLD REDPATH. His HloNoi said his attention had been called to a sum of 201. which bad been returned to this estate. It appeared that the Rev. J. G. Rowe, curate of Greenhow, in the north of England, had writtep to the bankrupt, among other persons, shortly before his failure, soliciting a subscription for the erection of a church. The bankrupt immediately sent him 201. Mr. Rowe felt that he could not in his conscience retain the money, as it must have been the result of frauds committed by the bankrupt on other people, and he had returned it to be placed to the credit of the estate. The circumstance was very creditable to the rev, gentleman and he mentioned it as an incident deserving of commen dation. I RiE W.

The duty of the Court being only to pass true accounts, the question arose, what was to be done with accounts like these 1 It was said that th must paSs because the Court could not get any better. Thet was no reason in his opinion. He thought that a man ought not to be entitled to the benefit of the bankrupt law if he could not show what had become of his property. The cases being of frequent occurrence, he wished the attention of the public and the Legislature to be caUed to the subject, in order that it might be decided what was to be done with persons who could give no account of what had become of their property. Hle could not feel that he ought to ps bankrupts on such accounts, and in this case there would be an adjournment nine die, with proteotion for six Mr. MAcmDum, as representing the assignee, a creditor for 5001., said he was very much dissatisfied with the accounts.

INSOLVENT DEBTOZS' COURT, May 13. IN RE CHARLES GEARY. (Be-fori, Mp C,'PTPp VAIA-WTC?All- % ilhls insolvent, who described himself as a Baptist minister, known as the Rev. C. Geary, and as the secretary of the Indlgent Sempstresses' Home, in Fitzroy-street, Fitz. roy-square, had petitioned for his discharge. His debts amounted to about 700l., nearly all of which had been in. cuzed on account of the Home, and to his connexion with that institution he attributed his insolvency. When the case was called, it was stated that the insolvent (who was at large on bail) was not in attendance, and his attomey produced a letter which he had just received from his client, requesting him to procure an adjournment of his hearing, as he was not well enough to attend. The CEasr Co0mmssIo0 said he should go on with the case. The recognizauces of the bail were forfeited by the insolvent's non-attendance, but they would not he enforced provided a good excuse could be made. Mr. SARGOOD appeared to o ppose on behbaf of Mr. Clark, a stationer and printer of Bath, and also for four creditors resident in that city, who were not entered in the schedule. Mr. Clark was first called, and he stated that he became acquainted with the insolvent in October, 1855, when, knowing that witness was about to publish a directory for Bat and its vicinity, the insolvent applied for informa. tion respecting the principal residents and visitors, repre. senting himself as connected with the Indigent Semp. stresse Home in London. Witness, believing the institu. tion to be a deserving one,and sympathizing with its objects, gave the information required. Shortly afterwards the in. solvent gave witness an order to print address cards with the name of " Capain Pope, Indigent Sempstresses' Horne, Fitzroy-street, tndon,' upon them, and subsequently others with the name of the " Rev. C. Geary," Wituess understood that Captain Pope was the secretary to the in. stitution, and was then engaged with insolvent in canvassing Bath for subscriptions. Other printing was afterwarda done by insolvent's directions. Several prospectwses and printed papers were produced, one containing a long list of patronesses of the Home, ineluding the names of Lady Eastings, the Countess of Donegal, Lady Melbourne, Lady Rothschild, &ce. another contained a list of subscriptions from Bath and Reading, and reference was made to a branch of the Home eatablished at Bath, and another at 59, Queen's-road, Brighton. Mr. SARGOOD said he was instructed that some names had been used in those papers without the permission of the persons who bore them. Mr. Clark proceeded to state that upon sending in his bill to the committee of the Home at Midsummer, 1856, he found considerable hesitation and delay in reference to pay. ment, but, after much pressing,the insolvent, on August 29, gave a bill of exchange for 251. 9s. 6d., payable in three months at the Edgeware-road branch of the London and County Bank. The bill was dishonoured, and the sum now due was .311. The insolvent, in September, induced witness to cash a check for 31. 10s., stating that he required the cash to enable him to proceed to non, while in truth he applied the money to the repayment of a Mr. Gregory, to whom he had given a check which had been dishonoured, and who refused to leave the insolvent until his claim was satisfied. When Mr. Clark presented his check for payment it was dishonoured, but, after much pressing and some threats, he succeeded in procuring payment. The affidavits of four creditors at Bath were then read. Three of the creditors were newspaper prourietors of the city, whose claims arose on account of advertisementa of the Indigent Sempstresses' Home; and the fourth, Mr. Rollway, was a printer, who claimed 191. 8s. for work done by insolvent's orders. Mr. Richard Ferguson, the chief clerk to the Mendicity Society, was then called. He said he had been acquainted with the insolvent since 1852, the date at which the Home was started by him. He was present at a meeting of the committee of the society, which was held last year at the Home in Fitzroy.street. At that meeting General Broke, General Pemberton, the Rev. Canon Dale, and others were present. The meeting Was called at the instance of the Rev. Mx. Gill, who lived a few doors from the Home, and who was continually annoyed by applications being made to him for information respecting it, Mr. Geary was present, and witness informed the committee of all he knew concerning him, He first called their attention to the insolventVs former connoxion writh a notorious impostor calling himself Dr. Derrhurst. and styling himself doctor of dli. nity, laws, or medicinje at different periods. The insolventc admitted the connesion, but pleaded that he had beleved Ik, Dweburstib be hznanthanh@m$g ludh uitnes then reminded him that on the occasion of Genenal Evas sweond election for Westminster a dinner was given of whiech he had the management, and that he bad received the price of various dinner tickets which he had not handed over to the landlord of the tavern This charge the insol. vent at first denied, butbeing confronted with th landlord, who was in an adjoming room, he admitted it, but said the matter had escaped his memor.y. Witness then asked him whence he derived his qualification as a " reverend," to which he answered that he was a Dissenting minister - whereupon witmess inquired whether he had not been or&ied by the notorious Dr. Dillon, who, being turned out of the Church, had set up a religious denomination of his own ; and the insolvent admitted that was the fact. In reply to further queries from witness the insolvent admitted that he had been secretary to a loan society at Chelsea, and that there was something due from him to that society; neither did he deny that he might have received some small debts on account of a man named WiL which he had omitted to pay over. He also said he had been a bad man, but had quite reformed. The committee thereupon decided towith&i~aw from the concern, finding that hey had been mere ciphers, and that the insolvent was the only ~ ~ ~ heinolen wastheonlyperso d any control over the instituThe CEm11 CoussoNxm remarked that this inquiry did not appear to have broken up the institution. Mr. Fergason.-Oh, no, Sir I I is going on now. Mrs Meler, the matron, and Mr. Wes1 the sub-treasurer, are in court. The witnebs proceeded to state that the original institution was In Newman-street, under the auspices of one Roper, who misconducted himself in the same way as the insolvent was new charged with doing. A committee of that institution made an inquiry, and Roner resignAe whereupon insolvent presented himself, and the committee of ladie; believing hum to be a clergyman, accepted his Eervices as secretary. He remained in that post for some time, but finding the institution did not pay, he gave it up and started a new one in Carburton-street, using the names of many of the subscribers and patrons of the old socetv in the prospectus of his new undertaking. The Mendicity Society charged him at a police-court with obtaining money, but not beig able technically to prove the eharge it was dismised. The committee of the Indigent Sempstresses' Home which sat last year had, he beheved, only met once before, and upon that ocasion they somewhat indis. creetly put their names to certain papers presented to them by Geary as vouching payments made by him. The CI CoM &oN3 asked whether any persons had ever been received in the Home? r. Ferguson replied that there had, no doubt, been some persons relieved,tokeep up appearances, as some thousands of pounds had been enbecribed. The wfiteso added that he behieved Captain Pope was about estahlishing a new institution, and Mdrs. Mller, the matron of the Home, intended to start another. Mr. Solomon Abrahams, of Gravel-lane, Hloundsditch, biscuit baker, was then examined as to the non.attendance of the insolvent. He said he had despatched his co-surety in a cab to Acton, where Geary redded, to bring him to the coutrt. Mr. Weston, aprinter, and a creditor for 69., made a statement, the chief woint of which was that the two books filed by the insolvent could not be the only books he had kept, and there were no means at present to ascertain the receipts and expenditure of the Home. Upon examination of the books filed, it was found that one was a ledger of sums received during a certain period and the other a weekly statement of expenses; the principal items of which appeared to be Ul. per week to the nsolvent as his salary; lUs to MmMeller, the matron ; and 10 per week each to the matrons at the Bath and Brighton branches. In one week credit was taken for 61. paid away in relief and for work done by sempstreases. Mr MeUer, being in court, was called. She stated that in 1852 she was engaed by the insolvent as superintendent of the Distressed Needlewomen!s Home, then established at Carburton-street. She afterwards became matron upon the retirement of Captain Pope's daughter, who had previously filled the situation. Her salary, which at first was 9s. per week, had been increased to 18s, with coals, candles, and residence. She had wished to leave 12 months ago, but remained upon the persuasion of Mr. Geary, who said her retirement would deprive the poor needlewomen of a home. Herdaties were to superintend the work done, to receive ladies who called, and to hand over, or account for to Geary, any sabscriptions she might receive. The Home was intended for persons who had been in good circumstances, but who were now compelled to seek a livelihood byneedlework, but were not sufficiently skilled to be able to maintain themselves by that means. There were at present six persons resident in the Home, the largest number ever reddent at one time being nine. Many of those persons were very aged. Others were employed at the Home in making up work which was brought for that purpose by ladies. These workers received Is., ls. 3d., or Is. 6d. per day, and the residents in the Home had coda and candles in addition. At one time there had been 70 workers atthe Home. The prices paid by adiesfor work done were the usual prices, but the workers were not so quick as the more pracised needlowomen, and the institution frequentlzy d more for the work done than it received from the - es who gave it. Mr. West, a pinter, said he was a creditor of the insolvent for M74, and of the institution for 92h. He had known Geary for about three years, and had been paid about 501. for work done. About a year and a half ago he received a letter from the insolvent, stating that the committee of the Indigent Sempstresses' Home were anxious that he (hr. West) should accept the office of treasurer. Being assured that no responsibiity would attach, he accepted the office, and received a printed paper containing the rules for the guidance of the treasurer, whose duties were defined to be the payment into the bankers' of any moneys which he might be able to collect for the benefit of the institution Laughter.) He resigned the post about nine months since. Ding the period of his treasurership he coll1ected from his personal friends about 501., which he paid into the bankers' to the credit of the Eome. Ee never received at any time any other money as treasurer of the society. Captain Pope, he beleved, was secretary; and he heard that there was a committee, but he never saw any of them. 3fr. SARGOOD said he conld proceed no futher in the absence of the insolvent, but he thought he shoulad have to require an amended description. He vas instructed that the insolvent had passed as Professor Geary, and he had a handbill of an anti-Popish lecture given in 1850 by that prsonage, whose tracts and sermons were to be sold at the doors, although no coliection or charge for admission was made. The lecturer was described as the Principal of the Sarrey Educational Institate, lecturer upon Anoient Egypt, Greece, and Palestine, author of Sermons against Popery, Spirtual Baptim & c. It was also announced that he would exhibit a Catholic wafer. The CnF C03u1ssiso.yER said it was clear the description must be amended, and as he did not choose to attend to-day he must make a proper applcation for another After the case had been concluded the bail came into court vwith the insolvent, aud wished to surrender him, but there being no prison officer in attendance to receive him the bail took him in a cab to Whitecross-street prison.
MIDDLESEX SESSION{S, Wednaday, May 13. (Before Mr. PASE:LLY, Q.C., Assistant-Judge.) Daniel Walker, 20, and Ellen Barry, 50, were indicted for having stolen a sheep, the property of Edmund Tulley. Walker srrendered in discharge of bail. Mr. Horry proseeted; MIr. Langford appeared for *Walker. From the evidence adduced iix sapport of the charge It appeared that on the night of the 22d of April two constables named Playford and Menham were in a field near Hormsey-wood, where there were some sheep, the property of the prosecutor, a cattle dealer in Regent-street,, Mile-end. They saw two men, one of whom it was alleged was the prisoner Walker, lay hold of one of the sheep, and lift it over some hurdles. The female prisoner was standing on the other side. One of the eonstables got over a fene, but in doing so made a noise, which alarmed them, and the men ran away. The woman ran across the railway, and concealed herself in a ditch, where she was found, covered over with an old coat, and a knife, a bag, and a piece of cord were taken from her. The constables spoke to the identity of Walker as one of the two men from a previous knowledge of him, as he had for some years pursued the avocation of a costermonger in the neighbourhood of Hornsey and Holloway, and one of them deposed to seeing him and the woman in company with the other man the night before the robbery near ERornsey-wood-house. - Mr. LANGFORD addressed the jury with some ingenuity on behalf of Walker, and called witnesses to prove an alibi and give him a good character. Nothing Was known of the wroman, she was a stranger to the neighbourhood. The lury retired, and after being ont about an hour and a half, they agreed to a verdict of Guilty against both prisoners. The poliee said six sheeo had lately been stolen from the same field and others adjoining. Walker solemnly protested his innocence. The AmsTAT-JTUDGE said, if anything further could be adduced to prove the prisoner's innocence it must be submitted to the Secretary of State, when further inquirv would take place.

The evidence of the police went to showr that there wras a pretty general fight at the house when r ty arrived and that cdmpoeant did not give the samne veron exactly of the transacton then. M1r. Wontner, having addressed the magistwto at some length for the defendant, called a witnes, who said that the men fell together in a scuf}le, and denied that the woman lumped uponu complainant's leg. Mr. Asesone ws unot disposed to adjudicate upon the case; it suggestad ittsef toohim that be should either send itto the Session or leave the comptainant to sue in the County Court for the ionury he had sustined.

William Sealey, the landlord of the Ploanh pnbhchonse, Permondsey-street. Frederick heongh i2 X, said that about half-past3 that morning he was on duty in Bermondsey-street, khen the prisoner came up to him and told him that there wras afre at the Plongh publichoase, at the corner of Dyer s- gateway. Witness went with him to that place and perceived smoke issuing froan a shed in the bak promises attached to the house. E[elminediately despatched the1 prsoner for the engines and then he roused upthe inumate. On gaing an entrance ho soon extinguhed the fire, and on the return of the risoner he asked him his name and address, wihen he said we had no fied residence. After that e said, Who do you suppose set fire to the place ? Witness told him he could not say. The prisoner said, " I know who did. It vwas me." He asked him what he did it for, hen he answvered that he ws ithout a home and corn. plotoly destitute. Watness then took him to the st tion. nouse and locked him ap, nd afterwards returned to er. Sealed s house. He then examined the o hed, and found a quantity of burnt rgs and wood, but the fire had not touchea any portion of the building. Mr. Co, the asked how it wasithat he could gain an entrance tothe shed9 The constable replied that he mu have climbed a walU eight feet high. In answer to the charge, the prisoner acknowledged being in the prosecutofs shed and burning some old rags, but he had no intention of settUng the house on fire. He was destnte and wathout i moans of subsience. 3Ir. COtbE said that as no portionof the building was set fireto the harge of arson failed. He should, iomever sentence him to three months hard labour for entering the premises for an unlawful purpose. oftebar,i.-Ma S. Patteson, the wrife of a beerhousekeener in thoe Waterloo-road attended before Mr. Ezalo rr in the absence of her hcuband, who is in prison for debt, to answer a sumhmons chaeging her with keepiang her house open for the sale of beer durng the hours of divine service on Sunday, the 3d inst. Police-constable Qaickendon, 41 A, deposed tht on Sun. day, the 3dinst., at three minutesoast 11 o'clock, he visited the Windsor Castle beerhouse, Waterloo-road, in company with another constable and found four men in front of the bar, all of whom had been served with beer In crolssexamination by 3I. Binus, who attended on the part of the defendant the witness aitted that both he and the other constble were in plain clothes or rather in disgauie, when they entered the house, and had a glass of beer each, which they paid for. HIe had gone in disguise by order of his superior officer, and was not aware that thiere was among the general reguLations issued by the Police ommissioners an oder against const bles under ny circumstances doing such duty in plain cothes. e. Joseph Jones, 151 L, corroborated the testimaony of the MIr. Binns, with some warmth, condemned the spy systom among the police, as adopted in the P resent case, as naEnglish and disgraceful, and hoped his worship would show his reprobation of it by dismissing the complaint. His clent, he said, was at that moment incarcerated in prison, not however for any offence, but sheer poverty and misfortune . and he (bMr. Binns) imatook very much if he hdnot ro in the Commissioners' rules for the guidance of the police that under no circumstances were the constables to entrap persons into an offence by assuming a lnspector Byron, at whose instance the information was laid, informed the magistrate that the present defendant bhaad bn before convicted of a smilar offence, and since that time varlious complaints had reacbed the police, and many of them from persons in his own trade, that he was still carrying on a regular Sunday trading. The only way that this could beo deteced and Put a stop to was by officers going there in plain clothes, and under the circumstances it was sanctioned by the Cornmissioners. Mr. ELLioTT said he certainly could not approve the ractice of constables goin in disguise to these honses, and nducing an offence by caling for drink, which was illegal. In fact, the officers should be no party to the offence, and, had the case rested on the mere fact of their being themselves served with beer, he should not have entertained the complaint. Mr. Bisns hoped his worship would take into his mercifnl consideration the unfortunate position of the husband of the poor woman who stood before him, and who was without the slightest means of paying a penalty. 31r. ErxrOv should, under the circumstances, dismiss the summons on the payment of costs, and hoped the leniency shown wvould not be abused, for if so thoeighest penalty would be Imposed theonext time.

Tho Duke of Cambridge, with the view of acertaining the opinions of the various commanding roffloers respecting 'the new clothing issued to the troops during tho present year, has directed that aU officers in the command of corps eshall forward the proceedings of boards 1eld for the purpose of inwpecting the clothing received for the troops under 'their commuad to the Horse Guards, with an opinion of the new tunics issued to their men. Rer Meajesy stea storeship Urgent, Commander S. Phillips, with the 67th Regiment from the West Indies, 'arrived at Plymouthyesterday. Yesterday the troops dationoi-at:0hatham garrison, consisting of the depOts of theo lrovisiond Battalion, under the command of Colonel H. Jeevis, thei Royal Marines, commannded by Colonel S. A. Pamker, -ad the Royal Engineers, under theaommandof Coknel M.xSandham, were drawn up en Chathr.an Lines, when the entire brigade went through a 'variety of maneuvres, uner'the&irection of Colonel Eden, 'commandant of the garzkon. A melancholy accident oecuroad yesterday morning to a colour-sergeant of the RoyalErrgineers at Chatham, named Edward Barnicoat, an experienced diver, who died under 'very mysterions oircuenstancee while occupied in diving for 'the purpose of recovering the 32-pounder iroa gun and carzriage which accide stally sank during the experiments which took place at old Rodiester-bridge on Saturday last, -on the occasion of the trial of Lieutenant-General Sir 'Charles Paslej's newly-invented pontoons. Yesterday -rnorning a party of the Royal Engineers, under the command of Major F. C. Hassard, proceeded with the necessary diving apparatus to endeavour to pro,oure the gun, which they had been unable to do on Monday. Colour-Sergeant Barnicoat, who was said to be <one of the most experieneed divers iu this country, and who was employed in recovering the wreck of the Royal George -at Spithead, was -selected to go down, having been unsuccessful in his eearch on the previous day. During the time lhe was under waterSergeant Barnicoat repeatedly gave the usual signals for " nnore air," &c., but it was noticed that he never replied to any signals made to him from above. After being under water about half-an-hour he signalled for lass air," which was the La received, and in about 10 -minutes afterwards Major Hassard, finding that he did not xeply to the signals, ordered him to be drawn up, which was done, when it was found that he was quite dead, and 'the diving dress partly fiUed with water, although nearly the whole of the head was dry. The time the sergeant was under water barely exceeded half-an-hour, and the whole of the apparatus was in good repair, with the exception of a slight leakage in the air pipe, which, however, was con'sidered of no consequence. A jury assembled yesterday evening to investigate the circumstances, when, after hearing the evidence of Major Hassard and the other witnesses, the jury returned a verdict that the deceased was aceidentally drowned. Sir Colin Campbell, G.C.B., Inspector-General of Infantry, arrived in Cork on Saturday morning for the purpose of inspecting the regiments in that garrison. The 36th depot, under command of Colonel Halliday, has left Cork for Athlone 300 strong. The company which was stationed at Spike Island was relieved by one of the 99th Foot. The service companies of the 36th Regiment are expected to arrive from America in the latter part of this month, They are to land at Portsmouth. The 3d Light Dragoons are expected daily to arrive in Cork from Cahir, in the room of the 13th. Half a company of Artillery left Cork on Thursday, under command of Captain Blackburne, for Limerick. The screw corvette Malaeca, 17, Captain Farquhar, arrived at Spithead yesterday forenoon from the Meditersraean. She left Malta on the 15th of April, and Gibraltar on the 29th. She brought 20 soldiers of various regiments from Malta, 10 Sappers and Miners from Gibraltar, 2 women, and 6 children. She filled up with Commissariat stores, &o., as usual with vessels now coming home from Malta. On the 1st inst., in lat. 37-0, long. 10 0, exchanged numbers with the steamship Golden Fleece; on Sunday, West of Scilly, exchanged numbers with Her Majesty's ships Exmouth and ColossuS, under canvass; on Monday, off Scily, spoke the brig Mountaineer, 55 days from Gibraltar, and supplied her with water. The Malacca has sailed for P'lymouth, taking round supernumeraries. The,United States steam-frigate Niagara passed the Wight yesterday for the Thames, to ship her portion of the Atlantic telegraph cable. The Hotspur, Indiaman, one of Smith's squadron, passed the Wight yesterday from India for the Thames. She experieneed strong easterly winds for 14 days. She passed the Southampton Indiaman, bound up Uhannel, and a large -quantity of shipping. Among her passengers are Major Ricketts, Captair B. P. Reid, Messrs. B. Frazer, C. W. Janvrin, L. North, F. W. Goldsworthy Brownlow, &c. T'he screw steamship Exmouth, 90, Captain Harry Eyres, which aTrived with the Colossus at Plymouth yesterday morning from Lisbon, struck the ground about three miles north of the Lizard on Tuesday morning, during a dense fog, and was for a short Lime in some danger. She was under sail with a light wind from south-west, and was supposed to be in a fair course for Plymouth Sound. At S.15 a.m. land was suddenly discovered right ahead. The Exmouth was put about, and when in the act of going round took the ground forward; sails were lowered, andshe fell off immediately into deep water. The anchor was let go in seven fathoms, steam got up, and within a few mainutes of 11 o'clock the shiD was out of danger. The starboard fore boiler was bulged by the concussion, and some of the bolts are bent, which makes the boiler leak. It is supposed that a portion of the false keel forward has been knocked off, and that some of the bolts connecting it with the keel have been loosened, as the ship has a leak averaging an inch per hour. The tide was in the last quarter of the aebb. Land was first seen at 6.30 a.m., and the course marked at 8 a.m., when they were about 15 miles south of 4he Lizard. A strong northern curreut is supposed to have put the ship out of her course. The erection of the new slips at Pembroke dockyard is p)roceeding rapidly. Their length is very great, in order to meet the increased size of our modern men-of-war. The beds are of limestone, with solid copings of granite. 'The widening and lengthening of the dock are actively being carried out, and this year are to cost 20,0001, It is proposed that the navigation sin front of the docklard shall be materially improved by being both widened and deepened. Large quantities of mud in banks have been {or many years accumulating, and these are to be removed. 'The mud between the Car Spit and the dockyard is to be scoured away. The extension of the sheds seaward is proceeding rapidly, as also the erection of the various new workshops, &o. The sum to be expended this year on the extension and improvements at this dockyard cannot be less than 10,0001. The following promotion has taken place:-William Mllackay Ogilvie, late assistant surgeon of Her Majesty's fiagship Boswawen, to be surgeon, R.N.
THE A2FI'SNS AT WOOLWrICH. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-You were good enough a short time since to espouse ihe 4ause of the distressed artisans and labourers who by -the cessation of Government works at Woolwich, consequent -on the close of the war, were somewhat suddenly thrown ,out of employment. Will you, by the insertion of this letter in yor journal, allow me to plead with the public in their behalf? More than,5000 persons have been discharged from the BIoyal Arsenal, and a large number of them, unable to obtain employment in these parts, and being without the manans of removing their families to a distance, are at this maoment suffering great privation and distress in compulsory ddioness. Many of the,men are most anxious to emigrate to the 3British colonies, or to be sent to any place where there is a demand for labour. With a view to assist them in their laudable desire to obtain oniployment a committee has been formed at Wool'wici and a subseription has been set on foot, but I fear that, w.itLout the aid of Government or large contributions from the benevolent beyond our own locality, there is little prospect of our being -ble to meet the urgency of the case. Conoeiviag that the distress of a large number of men located in Woolwich and its neighbourhood for national purposes has a fair claim upon national sympathy, and being compelled to witness day by day the poverty which exists in my parish, I am induced to appeal to the benevolence of your numerous readers-believing that I shall not ,cppeal in vain-in behalf of the famuilies of these poor men, srrho, by no fault of their own, ae really at the present time ,reduced to a state of extreme destitution. I am, 8ir, your obedient servant. ,rr- - . I TX . _ Rector of Wooiswich .- -.- --y' -LAY I..".

EXTRAORDINARY OA,SE. BRIGHTON POLICE.COURT. WEDNESDAY, BYX )3 THATCHER V. D'.tGUILAB. (Before Mr. A. BIGGE, Mr. 0. BURROWS, Mr. I5 A. ARGI& Mr. T. WAxER. and Air. D. x. FOLKARTi.) lhis was an action brought by Too Plaint jI, Mrs. Thatcher,widow of an Indian officer, against the "defendant, Colonel D'Agnilar, son of Sir George D'AguailAr,. charging him with being the father of her illegititiate cl0ild, and with having negleoted to contribute to it sapport.. Both parties are well known in fashionable cirdces here, and the case created a great degree of interest5 the co-rt being crowded during the hearing. Mr. Hutchinson. solioitort df Londron, appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Roupoll (instructed by M1essrs. Palmer and France) for the defendant. ar. Hutchinson briefly stated the circumstances of the case:-Mrs. Thatcher, the plaintiff, is the widow of an officer, and the daughter of an officer. In 1853 she was residing at Brighton with her children in a respectable position of life. In that year Colonel D'Aguilar, the defendant, beingen with tis regiment in Brighton, was attracted towarsher, andaTtergreat perseverance he obtained an introduction to her, and, having ascertained her position in life and what her father, husband, and brothers had been, he made her anioffer of marriage, which she accepted. After that tinfortunately an intimacy arose between them which resulted iu the lady giving birth to a child. Having left Brighton before the birth of the child, on learning that event he did al te could to break off the engagement, and made her an allowance of 301. a-year for the maintenance of the ahild. Upon the payment of this allowance there was this condition,-that the plaintiff was not to communicate with the defendant in any way afterwards. Plaintiff, however, had somewhat indiscreetly written defendant a letter, and after that defendant stopped the payment of the allowance. -En no occasion, however, had defendant ever denied or questioned his being the father of the child, and the present actien was brought more for the purpose of establish. ing the parentage of the chUd than for auy advantage likely to result from it to the plaintiff. The following evidence was then called. Ann Collins Thatcher, the plaintiff, sworn.-Mv husband was a medical officer in the service of the East India Com. pany. In 1852 I became acquainted with Colonel D'Aguilar. At that time I was a widow, reiding in Brighton, at No. 12, Montpelier-street. I had all my children with me. At that time Colonel D'Aguilar was residing with his father, Sir George.D'Aguilar, at 30, Brunswick-square. in January, 1853, Colonel D'Aguilar caUed upon me. I had met him several times before. Mr. BIGGE.-Where are you living now ? Mrs. Thatcher.-I am living with a highly respectable person in Brighton. Where ?-I don't think that is necessary. Oh, it's exceedingly necessary. Where are you living ?- Well, Iam living at No. 14, Charlotte-street, Marine-parade. When Colonel D'Aguilar called on me I thought that it was in an honourable manner - that he sought me, of course, to be his wife. He first of ali called, and after that he made me very valuable presents. Scarcely a day passed that he did not bring me the most beautiful and valuable hothouse bouquets. He called constantly, I may say every day, from about 3 or half-past 3 o'clock till about half-past 5 or 6 o'clock, except when he was absent in London. He also gave me his portrait. (Portrait produced.) He also gave me a very valuable " engaged" ring, a raby worth 40 or 50 guineas. He also gave me this lock of his hair. (Kissing it.) I had a child unfortunately by Colonel D'Agufar. It was born on the 24th of December, 1853 Colonel I'Aguilar is the father of that child. There is no pretence whatever for saying that anybody else is the father of thel child. Colonel, D'Agular asked me who my father was. He held a high official position, that of Master Intendent at Bombay. Prior to that he had been Marine Surveyor-General at Calcutta. Our position in life was qu'te equal to that of Colonel D'Aguilar. One of my brotuers died in battle, and .the other, until he died, held a high position in the East India Company's service. I gave Colonel D'Aguilar a memoir of my father. When 1[told him all that he became very attentive to me. That was before he gave me his likeness and the lock of hair. When he gave me the ring he took it out of his pocket and put it on my finger-the third finger of the riglt hand. He then hissed mv hand. He freauently talke tto me about marriage, and I always looked upon him as my affianced husband. This is the child (holding up a iina little boy), and I think those who know Colonel D'ar will say that there is a very strong likeness. Colonel D'Aguflar brought his portrait to me after he had put the ring on. It wFas in April, 1853, I think, that he puit the ring on my finger. That is an excellent likeness of him, only he did not wear moustaches when I knew him, and he told me he was in ill health when it was taken. I used to teach him the piano, and he offered to teach me drawing n return, but he never did to. He went to London in April, 1853, and some little impropriety took place between us befor e left. In May, 1853, I discovered my position, and I wrote to Colonel D'Aguilar to inform him of it. He told me that our marriage must be private, that his father and mother, Sir G. and LadyD'Aguilar, had higherviews forhim, and that he was sure they would never consent to the marriage. I did not object to that. Mr. James Turner, surgeon, of lIegenoy-equare, attended mi in my confinement. did not engage him, nor did I pay him. After the birth of the child I had several letters from Colonel IYAguiar. I think altogether I had about 50 letters from him while he was in London. I had them twice a-day frequently. Before the child was born I received a letter from Colonel D'Agniiar, requesting me to send back to him all his letters and the one in which he made that request. He said if I would do that he would be inclined to fulfil his promise of mnarrige, and on the faith of that I sent him back aU his letters. After the child was born, in consequence of something I heard from Mr. Turner, the surgeon, I was in the habit of drawing checks on Messrs. Hall, West and Co., the bankers, for 71. lOs. a-guarter. Mr. Hutchinson caled for those checks, which he had given Mr. Roupell notice to produce. Mr. Roupell was sorry he could not accommodate Mr. Hutchinson. Examination continued.-The checks were always paid to Mr. Jenner, of Preston, with whose family my child was placed. I drew the first check in January, 1854, and the sast in April, 1855. The checks were drawn regularly once a quarter, from January, 1854, tiU April, 1855. I received the foUowing letter from Colonel D'Aguilar in Mday, 1854:- My London, May 30. l' 1854" was added in plaintiff's handwriting.) You wiu then immediately give me the name and address of the person you suppose or kneo to bave written this letter. I sar 'know,, because the knowledge of my name and family could only have oome to them through youreelf. I shaU not in any way shrink from orenly meeting them on the subject, and referring them to your own medim. adviser, Dr. Turner. The matter, however, wiu then remain as it always has been. I met sou in the streets, without any Introduction; you were then living with another person, which I took case to know before I had any intercourse with you whatever. In spite of your having repeatedly told me al sorts of falbehoods (which I can bring forward and prove), upon your declaring this child is mine I pay all your expenees, which were double what they ought to have been, and make you an allowance four times wbat you would get in a courtof justice. 1 could not do more than this. With regard to my adoptfui the child and renewing my acquaintance with yourself, they are both completely out of my Power, andI should be wrong if I allowed you for an instant to hope It. In caves of this sort, you, by law and nature, are its natural protector; and,when I make you the allowance I have done, I consider -and it is also the opinion of other3-that I have done all that ii under the circumatances required of me. I now wish you farewelL and beg. with the exception of the address I have asked for, you will not correspond with me further. The amount, aw long as you ase esonable, will be ordered to be paid to you a. usuaL" Colonel D'Aguilar never accused me of any impropriety of conduct before I received that letter. £ believe no man could have been more attentive to me than he was, and no woman could have loved a man more than I did him. I never received any money from Colonel lYAguilar in any way except by those checks. The money I received was applied to the maintenance of the child. I brought an action for breach of promise of marriage against Colonel D'Aguilar in 1855, I think. It is stil in abeyance. I met Colonel D'Aguilar once in the streets of London, and he abused me before the passers-by. I think that was about 18 months after the birth of the child. It was in a public street loading out of Regent-street. He caUed me the most opprobrious and abusive nameS possible. That was the only time we have met since. To support this child 1 have been obliged to take a situation as a teacher in a school. Cross.examined.-The action for breach of promise is in abeyance. I brought another action against Colonel D'Aguilar in the Westmhinster County Court. That was brought for the maintenance of the child. I was taken so ill in court that I cannot tell what was the result. EMr. Hutchinson said in that action the plaintiff had been nonsuited. Was any arrangement made between you and your solicitor with respect to the costs or damages ?-No; certainly Dot. Do you swear that ?-Yes, I do. Was there any arrangement made between you with respect to the costs and damages in the action for breach of PrOmise ?-I canuot answer you. I don't think that has anything to do with the case. Can you tell me when it was you first met Colonel D'Aguilar .-Yes ; I certainly did meet Colonel D'Aguilar, and met him several times before he caled on me. You are ouly protracting this investigation. I as'ked yiou wShien you nrst met him I-I wfill not answer that ques- Mhr. BIGGB said, he thought she ought to answer it. Mr. Roupeil.-Oh, I'll let her go on. (To plaintiff.)Now, I ask you whether it was in 1852 or 1853 yoU first met Colonel D'Aguilar ?-In the latter end of 185l2. Then, you did not first meet bim in the year 1853, as you Where were you living at the time you first met him ?- At No. 12, hloeipellier-ereet. Now, I ask you again, more particllarly, in what month, and about what time ef the month, was it you first met him ?-I met him about ke end o f December. Where were yoa living bef'.re you went to live at No. 12, Montpelier-street?-I was living at No. 12, _.ontpellier. road, with some most respectable ladies named Shepperd. Where were you living before that ?- Mlontpellier-street. How long did yot live in Yfontpellier-street?-Abouta week or a fortaighL Before you first went to Moatpellier.street where were youliving?-I shall not answer yon that, betause it has nothing to do with Brighton or kis case. I was living ia London.walingn Now, I aslkyou where you were liv;ng inLondon?-I shan't answer you. ', - Oh, yes yo will.-It is quite indepeie,nt of this. Mr. Huthinisonsaid, be did nArt tSu,rch questions had ainy beang uDon the case. [r Rou*eOcllcntnded that he couli ask plaintiff any questions he pleased. Mr. HIutchtneon said, that nothing wshich took place prior to 1852couldl affiect the child's being tornt inv 1853. Mr. BIGGX said, it ,;isJs have somte bearing on the case, tough it might net affect that particular child. HEl shought plantiff ought to' nawer the question. .r. Roupell (to pylalnti).-Now, where w4er jogMing l t efore on first lived in Montpellier-slreet ?-I was living in lonao. You told me so already. Where in London?-Wlth a very respectable party, in Moore-street. WhaVs the number .-29 or 28-I forgot just nol. Where is that, in Chelsea or thereabouts9.-Yes, iVs in Chelsea. Now, what time did you leave that housein Moore-street'? -I left that in December-in the beginning of December. Did you not jnst now tell me that you first went to Montpellier-street in the end of January, 1853?-No; I went to Montpellier-street in the middle of December, 1852, the first time, end stayed about a week or a fort. nht. Now, will you tell me where it was you first met Colonel D'Aguilar ?-I first met him at the band in Regency-square, in Brighton. When was that ?-I really cannot tell you. I was walking one afternoon, and I went there to hear the band. Cannot you tell me more particularly when it was you saw him7.-No; I cannot. That was the first time I saw him. Did you speak to him, or he to you?7-No. When did you first see him to speak to ?-I met him several times out walking. Ee appeared to take an interest in me, and, as I considered him an agreeable-looking man, I took the same interest in him. He spoke to me first. In the street?-li took off his hat and bowed to me, and I bowed to him in rturn. That was the commencement of our acquaintance. Was that in the street ?-I consider t hat au improper question, and shall not answer it; it was oat of doors. Was it in the street .-It was in the street. I didnotbow to him. He took off his hat and bowed to me, and then I bowed in return. The next time we met we spoke. How longwas it between the time you first saw him and the tine he bowed to you ?-I really cannot tax my memory with such things. I only know that is how our acquaintance commenced. Was it a month from the time you first saw him 7-No it was more than a week. I was walking, as ladies generally do, taking my afternoon promenade, and I met him ; and as we had frequently met before, and as there seemed to be an understanding between us that he liked me and I liked him-a mutual understanding,-the next time we met he turned round and followed me. He made some trifling remark about the weather; I answered him; we then entered into conversation, and after some time he wished me good afternoon. How long was it between the time that you exchanged bows and his speaking to you i?-Three or four days. Was there any difficulty or necessity for an introduction to make you acquainted? Did anybody introduce you?-I bad ascertained who Colonel D'Aguilar was before I permitted him to speak to me. That is no answer.-I tell you I had ascertained that he was an unexceptionable personage, and I had no reason to decline the acquaintance of such a gentleman. It was a street acquaintance, in fact7?-I don't consider it so- Perhaps you don't consider it so; but was it not, in fact, an acquaintance met with in the streets without any intro. duction 7-I shall not answer that, because I don't consider it was a street acquaintance. May I take it so ?-No, you may not, because I knew who Colonel D'Aguilar was, and after that he had to get intrd. duced to me before he ever came into my house. I had no photographic likeness of Colonel D'Aguilar until he brought me that produced, nor of any other person. I had that portrait of my husband, and no other, previous to March, You make this application under the name of Thatcher ? -Yes. How long has that been your name7.-Since I was a married woman. How long is it since you went by any other?-My maiden name of Ross, I suppose you meanl I ask you how long it is since you have gone under any other 7-I have not gone by any namein particular. Sometimes one and sometimes another, according to circum. stances. The fact is I have been in a little difficulty, and, by the advice of my friends, I assumed my maiden name for a time; and one time, when I was pressed by my creditors, I took the name of Drnummond, my husband's mother's name. Thenyou have gone by the namo of Mrs. Ross, and that very lately ?-I don't deny it. And you have gone by the name of Drummond ?-That was some timne ago. 3ave you not also gone by the name of Thatcher-Drum. nmond 7-No, I believe not. Do you swear you have not 7-I may have done so, just to let psople knowv, wvhen writing to them, who I really was. Then, I take it that yoa have gone by all these namesRoss, Drammond, Thatcher, and Thatcher-Drummond7?No, not Thatoher-Drammond; I merely wrote "Thatcher" to let people know who I really was. I came down here to avoid pecunary di'diculties, Can you tell me where you were lving in 1850 2 Do you rLecollect living in the neighbourhood of Dorset-square, What was the name of the street 7-Milton-street. Were you living then with any person?-I was living in a boarding house, and my sister visited me daily. What was the number of the boarding house ?-I cannot recollect. Were you at that time living under the protection of any gentleman ?-Most certainly not. I am surprised that you should hint at such a thing. Do you suppose that my family would have been in daily intercourse with me if I had been lving under the protection of any gentleman ? Dd you atthattime know a gentleman who lived at Glasgow 1-No, I did not. Do you swear that ?-Yes. Did you at that time know a gentleman named Dunbar ? Yes; I had met him. I knew him in India-at Bombay. Did you know him at the time to which I am alluding?- Now, I ask you, were you not at that time living under the protection of Mr. Danbar ?-Most. certainly not. Did you at that time receive any money from him ?- Most certainly not. Do you swear that 9-Uost solemnly, on thisbook, Iswear I never received a farthing from him. Or from any gentleman who was living at Glasgow?-Or from any gentleman who was living at Glasgow, or any one else. iave you not said so?-What? That you were receiving money from this gentleman?-I said so ! Whoever has dared to make such an assertion has told a vile falsehood. I have never received a farthing from tha gentlemian. Do you swear you have not said so 7-I swear it. Did you not send a person to communicate with a gentleman at that time living near Dorset-square ?-No; I did not. That you swear?-Yes, I do. Do you know a person named Charlotte Jane Husband? -IkLow a person who calls herself Mrs. Earley, whose name, I beheve, is Miss Husband. I never asked her to go and see a gentleman living near Dorset-square. I never sent for monoy to any gentleman living in the neighbourhood of Dorset-square. I have always been in the receipt of a good income. After that I was living for a time in Albany. street, Regent's Park. I was ia apartments there, over a library.,I don't know the number. I left that to come to Brighton. That was the time I was in such pecaniary difficulties, and took the name of Druammond. There was no other reason for my leaving. I did not quarrel with my landlady, Miss Husband was living in that house with me for a short time. Now I caution yoe to be carefal, and I ask yoU, were you not dismissed and turned out of that house by the landlady in consequence of being found on the bed by her with a gentleman ?--No. You swear that 7-I most certainly do. The landlady was a most respectable woman, and my sister was with her when I came away. Did you not go away rather suddenly ?-No; I gave her due notice. Bow long ?-Well, I suppose three or four days. Now, do you recollect going out one day, and immediately atter you had come in a gentleman coming in to ask for you?1-No. Do yoa recollect the landlady coming in and saying, "A gentleman has asked for the person who has just come in, and so I think it must be you ?"-Certainly not. Did not the gentleman come in immediately after you?No; I remember nothing of the sort. Do you not recollect the circumstance of a gentleman,or maniI should call him,-coming in after you one day iato the dining-room 1-No, I do not. Were your rooms on the ground or upper floor?-On the upper floor. Was the bedroom adjoining the sitting-room i-It was. Did not the gentleman, or man, take you into that bedroon, and did not the landlady find you there ?-Most cer- That you swvear ?-I do. While I lived in Moore-street I also knew a gentleman named Firth. He was a oeui of mine. He came to see me frequentaly in Moore-street. Ble wash very fTond of me and of my children. HIe did no^t sleep thuere. I also knew a gentlem~an nDeGrvil.EeO never slept in the house, I shall not say how I became ac- quainted with him. I did not go with him to the Golden rossI Ishall refuse to answer any questionwith regard to that gentleman. I have never been on very intimate terms with him. I have never said to Miss lHusband that I was. He cameto see me before I came to Brightonto make arrangement with me about his little girL He is a widower, and he wanted me to take his little girl and bring her up and educate her with my own children. He came down to Brighton, I think, in February, 1853. He came down on the evening of the 2d, I think, and left on the morning of the 3d. It is true that he had a bed at my house, and I have witnesses to prove that he slept in a room by himself, that I had my eldest daughter sleeping with me, and that, in fact, not the shadow of an impropriety took place between us. I have never seen him since. I was at Gravesend in the year 1856. I saw Miss Husband standing at a window in Gravesend, and I went into the house and spoke to her. She did not say, "'What ! I thought you had gone to Scotland to live with an old man." I did net ask her to wrte a letter for me to a person near Glasgow. While I was in a situation in a school at Roigate I had an offer of marriage from a gentleman named Gllis. He ia a Glasgow merchant. He ha known my family for man.y years, for we are an. old Scotch family. He made me an ofer of marriage. He was unexceptionable in every point of view. I liked him very much, and I have no doubt I should bave been very happy with him; but I was obliged to tell him that I was not so virtuous a woman ashe, perhaps, thbought, that Ihad had a child by another man, and of course that ended it. I never told Miss Husband that an old gentleman had g,iven me 1001. to get rid of me and the child. I never told her that I was receiving I0O& a-muouth from Mr. Gilis vwhile I was at Brighton. I did not say, " I really cannot sa y for certain wbether it is the Colonel's or the old man's, bnt I have made them both pay." I never said I had any 'oubt as to who was the father of that child. Re-ezamined.-Having lived 16 years In Indi.i, where society is conducted altogether differently, I was not so nice about an introduction as perhaps I might hga7' b,'en. I atsumed moy miaiden nRme for no o9thwx pnrrp ti.az to avoid some }*Al?y difEiculties ia which I had become inTolved. Severall etra from the soicdtors to tho respective parties havig been put in, Mr. James Turner, sorgeon of Regency-square,Brighb0n, was eamined, and proved that he hsattended plaintiff during her confmement in 1853 by direction of Colonel D'Aguilar, who paid him. Colonel D'Aguilar had made an arrangement wit, vitness to allow plaintiff 304 a-year for the maintenance of the child. Henry Jenber, of Preston, in whose house Ilaintiff had been confined, and who hadthecare of the chi rovedthat the 301. a-year wa paid by checks draw qterly by plaintiff upon Messrs. HdaL qaeste and Cop Edward Augustus Hilder, solicitor, Gravesend, proved that he had been employed by plaintiff; whom he had knovn at Gravesend. Her conduct while there had been most exemplar, and he was in the habit of seeing her very frequently. In consequence of a communication made by Miss Husband to the East India-house he had been obliged to go there and explain the circumstances in order that some allowanceplaintiff receives might not be stopped. This was the plaintiftfs case. Mr. Roupell briefly addressed tho Bench for the defence. He said, his case was that plaintiff's charaeter was not unimpeachable, as he should prove, and that the money which be admitted had been d by Colopiel dAguilar had bien paid nnderamistake. Re thencalledthefolowingevidence:- Ann Mauwaring, sworn.-I reside at 49, Ebury-strees Pimlioo. I am now keeping a lodginghouse there. In 1&R5 Iwas livingli Moore-street, Chelsea, No. 29. I knew Mrs. Thatcherthen. She was living in that house in Moorestreet in 1852. She came there in May, 1852, and left, I think, in January, 1853. I am not quite certain that it was on the 3d she left; it might have been a day earlier. She was in the habit of receiving visits from a Mr. William Firth who represented himself as her cousin. He came with ner to take tho m?artuents, He was on close terms of intimacy with her. e. dined and supped with her. I have known him to be sleeping there more than once. It might be eight, or ten, or a dozen times. Bad he a room of his own there ?-No. Where did he sleep when he slept there?-With Mrs. Thatcher. Did you know that ?-I did. I am quite certain as to where he slept. He left in AugtLst to go to Australia, and after August there were several gentlemen in the habit of visiting her. There was ore named Granville, whose acquaintance I think she told me she had made in an omnibus or by chance. He went there by the name of Edwards. Ho appeared to be on the same terms of intimacy as the other gentleman. I can swear that he slept with Mrs. Thatcher once. There were others visited her in that house. In cross-examin tion witness admitted that plaintiff had charged her with stealing a 105.-note, and that she had not mentaoned any of the circumstances until after that accusation. Charlotte Jane Husband deposed that she lives atGravesend, and is the daughter of an officer killed in the Burmese war. Mrs. Thatcher and she had lived together in Albany. street. While there Ms Thatcher had asked her to cal I npon a Mr. Dunbar for money. She (plaintiff) was about to brinta:nction forbreachof promise of marriage against him. plaintiff was nothing better than a common prostitute, and threatened to give her in charge. On one occasion a gentleman followed them in and throwMrs. Thatcher on the bed. The landlady discovered them and bundled them beth out. This wituess then went on to affirm everyth-ing which the plaintiff had denied in her cross-exarmnation. Mr. Hutchinson was about to reply, when Mr. BiGGE said, the magistrates had unanimously come to the conclusion to make an order on the defendant for 2s. 6dLa-week.
THE FALL OF HOUSES rD5 TOTTEHAM-COURTI B~~~~OAD. An inquest was held yesterday by Mr. G. S. Brent, the Deputy Coroner for West Middlesex, at the Lord Welington publichouse, University.street, on the bodies of Frederick Byng, Ann Driscoll, Richard Turner, John Garnett, and James Kivil, all of whom were killed by the fall. ing down of three houses, Nos. 146, 147, and 148, Tottenham-court-road, on last Saturday mornin The following gentlemen were speciaUy summoned to constitute the jury:-William Dyke, 21, Grafton-street, tailor- Robert Pollock, 15, Osnaburg street, builder; Alex. auderwVatson, 20, Enston-place, architect; George Bossunm z Tottenham.court-road, coffee-housekeeper; George E1L 3, Tottenham-court-road, laddermaker; James Lintot, 14, Bath-plaoe, glas merchant- Thomas Alvey, 18, Howlandstreet, builder; John Eeles tawford, 15, Tottenham.courtroad, builder; Wiliam Pnrkins, 6, Cain-place, Kentish. town, builder; Septimus Battam, 160, Tottenham-courtroad, tailor; John Thomas Rothwell, 27, Bondon-street, house agent; Samuel Wills, 86, Tottenham-cout-road, bootmaker- Henry Mathews, 59 Warner-street, builder; Benjamin Witer, Charles-street, builder; SteDhen Rogers, Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square, timber merchant. Before the jury were sworn Mr. Brent said that he wished to consult with them whether they would proceed with the inquiry in the absence of Mr. Wakley, or postpone it until that gentleman was able to attend. He regretted to say that Mr. Wakley was detained at Brighton in consequence of the dangerous iUuess of his wife. That gentleman had requested him to express his sorrow at not being able to meet them on the present occasion, but if it should be their pleaure to defer the inquiry for a fortnight he hoped it would then be in his power to attend. Mr. Dyke, the foreman of the jury, after conferring with hisfellow-jurymen, said that im a matter of such importance, and one which had excited such great interest in the public mind, he and his brother jurors were of opinion that it would he inexpedient to adjourn the inquiry. The frienI, of the deceased would naturaly feel anxious to arrive at an earlz result of the inquisition. The Deputy Coroner.-Then, let the jury be sworn. They were sworn accordingly, and then proceeded to the london University Hoapital to view the bodies, after which they went and surveyed the premises where the catastrophe had occurred. On their return, The Deputy Coroner said, he should confine the proceedings of the day to taking the evidence of identi6cation of the bodies, of their removal to the hospital, and of the statements of the medical attendants; and he would then postpone, as far as possible, all evidence as to the cause of the calamity, and which poasibly would involve questions of some difcuty, to a future day lr. Giffard, barrister, instructed by Mr. J. W. Chamber. lain, solicitor, attended to watch the proceedings on behalf of the representatives of the deoeased Frederick Byag, and also on behalf of Mr. Maple, Mr. Raggett, Mr. Maple's surveyor, and Mr. Taylor, Mr. Maple's builder. Mr. Wiliam Cooper, barrister, instructedby Messrs. Hil and Mathews, solicitor appeared on behalf of Mr. Hunter, Mr. Redding, Mr. Hunter's surveyor, and Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hunter's builder. Mr. Wiliam Legaud Byng was then called and examined. He sid that he was at present living at Canterbury, and was out of business. He had formerly lived with Mr. Maple. The deceased Frederick Byng was his brother. He ast saw him alive in Brook-street, Holborn, when he was in good health. He had seen the body at the hospital, which he identified as being that of his brother. He had hinself lved with Mr. Maple for 14 years and a month, and had ctually resided in the house for 12 years. He had left Mr. Maple about a year. There had been improvements made in the premises from time to time, but the bailding was slwags considered safe. His brother leftthesituation about 'astChristmas, andreturnedto itagainonEasterMondaylast Adey Driscoll was next examined. She stated that she resided at 25, Southampton-place, Camden-town, and was the sister of Ann DriwoZ one of the persons killed by the accident. She had seen her sister's body at the hospitaland identified it. EHer sister was 26 years of age and unmarried. She was cook to Mr. Maple. She sawher sister last alive on the 3d of May. Her sister had never expressed anY apprehension of danger at residing on the premises. Ann Turner was then examined. She stated that she resided at No. 8, Hawley-crescent, Camden-town. Richard Turner, who was now lying dead at the hospital, was her husband. He was 29 years of age. He was in the employ of Mr. Taylor. He left his home on Saturdav morning last, between 5 and 6 o'clock, in good health. He had been talking to his baby. He had worked on Mr. Maple's premeseefor a fortnight previous to his death. He had never said anything to her as to there being any danger ; but she had heard from some person riding by the premises on an omnibus that there was some cause to apprehend danger. She was therefore fearful about it, and said to him that she would rather he should be out of work for 20 years than incur any risk - but she could not now say whether he made any reply to her remark. Mrs. S h Garnett was the next witness. She stated that she resided at 15, Little Albany-street, Regent's-park. She had seen the body of her husband, John Gariett, who was lying dead at the hospital. He was a carpenter in the employ of Mr. Taylor. She saw him alive on Saturday morning about 6 o'clock, when he got up. He was in good health. He told her to put his gluepot on the fire, as he should be at home about 4 o'clock. He was working on Mr. Maple's premises. She heard him say one evening that they were underminig the p lace, and that they had put a girder or something; and he also saidsomethingaboot itecracking, but she did not ask hima any questions. She did - not hoer him say that the work was dangerous; if he had he should not hAve gone. Alfred Barnes was called, and said he lived near Eburystret, Pimlico. He was a bricklayer, and worked for Mr. Johnson, wbose yard was in King's-place, Gray's-inn-road. He knew the deceased James K:ivil; he was a bricklayer's labourer, and was 29 years of age; he worked for Mr. Johnson. Witness had not seen the body of Kivil since it wastaken outof the ruinsof the house, 147, Tottenham-court. road, on Sunday last. Eivil was witness'slabourerat the time of the accident, and wa sireparing some compo forhim. They were both working for Mr. Johnson at the house 148, being MIr. Hunters premises. Kivil was with witness on Saturday morning from 6 o'clock until the accident occurred. In the performance of his work Eivil had to go down into the basement of the house to get water, and the last time wit. ness saw him alive was when he (Kivil) was coming up the ladder, between the joists of the ground-floor, with a pail of water. Witness was at work on the party-wall, cutting a hole at the end of the wall. He was then working on the ground-floor, and on Mr. Maple's side of the wall. AJuryman.-Who was engaged in cutting away the walls? The Deputy Coroner.-I rather think we are getting too far into the evidenoe. I wish to confine the present inquiry to a mere narrative of facts. Witness continued and said that Eivil was at the time in good health. The cutting of the wall was on the ground floor, and not on the basement, Oa Sunday witness came to the premises for the purpose of seeing whether Eivil's body was found. He fancied that he knew where the boda lay. He thought it very likely that Eivil had made his way through the hole in the wall The body was found on r. Maples premises with the face close to the party-wall in the basement. He saw the body when it was removed from the ruins. Eivil was a single man, and lived at Westminster. There was an ope - between the two houses 147andl48 by which a person eod getfrom one to tbeother. Joseph White stated that he was a labonrer, living at No. 4, Prinoe of Wales's-court, Hampgtead-road. He was working for Mr. Johnson on the premises whsui the housec fdL he was at the doorway when the accidesthappened. YIe escaped uninjured and saw the houses fall. He imme. diately began with others to seek for the bodies of those who were buried in the ruins. Te found tRig dZ y gf reriqk B. _b bdS floun the lead, from the top of the house, flat upon him. The roomwasnarlat the top of the house. EIe 1s it, dead. He appeared to witneassto be ))'Eed fla tby,the lead flap. He also assisted in getting Kivil out of therains oa Sunday. He saw the cook taken out on the SaturdAy. She was near where Mr. Taylor' son was lying. He as aided in rying out the naidi servant and one of the shopmen, ooth of whom were now living. Alfred Barnes was recalled, and said that anl the bodift were found on Mr. Maple's premiss. The bodies of Turner and Garnett were removed about 10 o'clock. There were two men working with him in the shop on the ground floor, both of whom escaped. The bodies of Turner and Garnett, when discovered, were lying one u on the other, and in a line with Tottenham-court-road. He did not see any in. juries on the bodies. They were taken out quite dead. Mr. W. P. Jones, M.R.C.s., was then examined-Ile deposed as follows :-I am the resident medicai offioer at the London University College HospitaL The bodies of the deceased persons were brought dead to the hospital on Saturday, except that of Xivil who was brought there on Sunday a£ternoon. I w them alL I examined the body of Byng first. There were no marks of extrnal inja. There was great lividity of the face and bead. A to external organs were healthy, and merely bhowed evidence of suffocation. That was the cause of Byng's death. I believe Ann Driscoll did not die of suffocation. I bolieve that in her case death must have been instantaneous from the laceration of the liver and of the diaphragm. The liver was torn into numerous pieces-eight or ten. There were four ribs on the right side broken, ana one on the left. There was no hemorrhage whatever. Turner's body exhibited a great deal of lividity about the ex. tremitles, but no external or internal injury. The lungs on the right side and the heart were filled by dark fluid blood, showing that he died by suffocation. Garuett also died from suffocation; in his case there was an extensive scalp wound, separating completely the scalp from the slCDl, but that was not the cause of death i it occurrod during life. There was no fracturm, or other mjury to the skull whatever. In Kivil's case, in addition tothe evidence of death by suffocation, there was a fracture of the left lega comminuted fracture, and also a comminuted fracture of the right thigh. There was no other injury. Arthur King, of 13, Little Gower-place, bricklayer, said he was in Mr. Taylor's employ, and was working at the party wall between Mr. Maple's two houses-146 and 147 - not between Mr. Hunter's and Mr. Maple's houses-147 and 148. He and two other men were employed strengthening the WalU by carrying up additional brickwork. There had not been any previously carried away. They were working from an old set-off, about 20 feet, perhaps, back from the street. The work ws being done In Roman cement. They had been wodking from 6 o'clock in the morning till about 20 minutes past 7, when bis attention was attracted by the dust falling from Mr. Hunters party wall, which waa immediately behind him as he stood at his work in the house 147. He was alarmed at the dust thus falling down the wall. The foreman of Jfr. Maple's bricklayers noticed the fact, and, told the men who were at work on Mr. Hunter's party.waU that they were taking away too mach of the brickwork, and if they did not take care they would have the whole building down. Witness heard no reply made to that remark. It was about five minutes after the dust was observed to fall that the houses felL He stopped at the place until he saw the building bulge-that was to say, Mr. Hunters partywall, in which holes had been cut. There were two men working with witness and some one told them to look out, for the place was coming down about their ears. He was present when that was said. The two bricklayers jumped off the scaffold and witness escaped by ing down the ladder. He haM to run, for the house in which he was fel ast as he got into the next shop in Tottenham-place. He reard a crack as he got to the doorway. Mr. Hughes and others escaped at the same time. Mr. Giffard wished the witness to be asked whether there were any openings in Mr. Hunter's party-wall. Witness.-I saw the bricklayers cut one hole at one end of Mr. Hunter's party-wall, and a hole at the other end. I should think that they were about four feet square. It is an old party-walL One of the holes was at the end of the wall towards Tottenham.court-road, and the other hole was about 10 feet further bark. Mr. Thomas Hugies, examined.-I am in Mr. Maple's employ as salesman. I resided on the premises, No. 2, Tottenham-place. On Saturday, at 7 o'clock, I was on the ground floor with our men, and was looking at the bricklayers! who were making a hole in the party-wall between our house and Mr. Hunter's. The men so employed were Barnes and KiviL They were not employed by r. Taylor. Mr. Taylor's men were not working on that wall at alL There was only one bricklayer at the hole, but some time before that I saw another man on Mr. Hunter's premises knocking at the wall and preparing to make another hole in it. The hole that had been made was about 5 feet high and 3 feet broad. Soon after 7 o'clock one of the bricklayers called out to me that the wall did not appear safe. One of our men called out-" The wall does not look safe ; there is some dust coming out ofit." I saw the wall and saw the dust coming out of it. Immediately afterwards the same person called out-"Run, runforyourlife," or something to that effect. I immediately ran, and he followed. There were some 8 or 10 of us running at the same time, and we got into our own premises just as the houses went down. I was standing on the rafters or beams when the alarm was given. There were at that time about 10 persons on the premises, some sleeping and some up, besides the workmen on the buildings. The servants were all up. There had been no aDprehension of danger entertained by any ofusbefore the accident occurred. From what I saw I attribute the falling of the houses to the makinz of the holes in the waLl. I cannot, however, give any opinion upon the subject. I dtd not sae any bulgmg of the walL It appeared to me that the faU was caused by the extra weght thrown upon the walL By a Juror.-I did not see the second hole cut in the wall, but I saw a man making preparations. I cannot, however, say how far he worked at it. I believe Mr. Taylor's son was on the first floor. Mr. Taylor, the father, superintended the job personally. r. Cooper asked whether Mr. Maple had not had some alterations made in the shop front some time previously. Wtness.-I can scarcely telL. I blieve there were some alterations made in the front. The alterations which were g made when the ccident happened were commenced about three weeks ago. There was one column, I believe, Mr. Cooper.-Wss,there not a new bressmmmer to the shop front previous to this? In point of fact, was not the shop front raised? Wltnecs.-The front was not raised. The DeputZy Coroner.-I do not think it is necessary to trouble Mr. mughes with any technical terms; besides- this iscarrying the evidence beyond what I at present wish to confine it to. (To the witness).-Were you under an impression that there was danger previously to this accident 7 Witness-I never apprehended any danger. I was walking about the place and on the rafters without the least apprehension of danger. Mr. Giffard.-I presume, Sir, that a full opportunity wil be hereafter given during the inquiry to ask Mr. Hughes any questions that counsel may consider necessary. The Deputy Coroner.-Oh yes, we shall not hurry the inquiry, and every opportunity wil be afforded for asking whatever questions may be considered pertinent to it. Mr. Sparrow Harrison was next examined. He said he residod at Hoxton, and was foreman to Mr. Johnson, builder. He was at work on Saturday last at Mr. Hunter's premises He went there at 6 o'clock with several other men-White, Jones, Barnes, Kivil, and others. Previous to the accident he set the men to work at different jobs, one of them being about the joists at the back of Mr. Hunter's warehouse. Witness was by trade a bricklayer. Jones and Barnes were also bricklayers, and were employed to cut away the holes in the party-walL Witness saw them commence that work Other men were at work in different parts of the building; he meant Mr. Hunter'spresent house. They were at work on the roof. About a-quarter past 7 o'clock witness went into the temporary office under the awning in the street to make out the time-shoet for the men, it being Saturday, when he was caled out by the labourer White, who said he was apprehen. sive of some danger by seeing some dust fallingdown the walL A Juror.-w hito, then, was alarmed?7 Witness.-Yes, White was alarmed. I looked into Mr. MIaple's premises. I stood at the end of the party-wall, so that I could see each side of the wail. The l)eputyCoroner.-Is that party-WalUCommon to both Witness,-Yes. The Deputy Coroner.-How thick is it ? Witness.-A brick and a-half, or 14 inches thick. The Depaty Coroner.-We, standing and looking on both sides, what did you see ? VWitness.-I heard it cracking. I could almost fancy it was from the roof on the left. A Juror.-That would be 147. Witness,-And knowing the state of the party-wall between 146 and 147 I called out to the men on both sides-to Mr. Maple's men and to the men working on our wall. I saw the men working at the party-wall and observed the progress they were making. The extent of the hole was about two feet six inches by nine inches at the end near tne street. It was not more. The other [opening was some thing like five feet high and nearly three t wide. I called out to both sets of men. The Deput Coroner.-What took place then? Witness.-Why, there was an immediate crash a dJuror.-They had not cut any of the walls in the house on the left-hand side ? Witness.-I believe they were underpinning. A Juror.-It has been sworn here that they were addin brickwork to the party-wall between the houses 146 and 147 but that they were not underpinning. Witness-I cannot say what they were doing. The dust was seen coming from the party-wall, between Maple's and Hunter's. There was not any unusual vreight on the wall. I heard a crash and saw the houses fall The front part of them fel into the street. I ws knocked down. but only slightly injured. I waited and assisted to extricate the persons who were buried in the ruins, and aided in bringing one or two of them out. I remained there shoring up the building, and superintending the men until the last body was found. A Juror.-You did not think it necessary to shore up the party waU lwhile you were underdinning in? Witness.-Not at all, Sir. A Juror.-It is understood, I believe, that we are not to go into any scientific evidenoe to-day, and therefore I think it would be better to ad'onrn. Mr. Cooper and Mr. Giffard concurred in the propriety of the course suggested. Tho Deputy-Coroner.-1My first intention was to stop after having taken the medical evidence. If we proceed with the examination of this witness we :shall be entering upon the whole case - I therefore have now only to ask when I can meet you, gentiemen, again ? A Juror suggested that the Court should meet again at 2 o'clock on Friday next. .Mr. Reeves, the surveyor to the Metropolitan Police, wishedto wohrtain wbetber the jury were satisfied with the view that had been taken of the premisee, so that the house (No. 145) now standing might be taken down as soon as possible, as it was dangerous. After a snort oonferenoe, The Deputy-Coroner said the jury would like to have as much of te party walls left stnding between the houtes I14f and 147 and 147 and 148 as possible for theirJnzpection tqr the ruins had been cleared.

DoNcAsTm NEw PABis}I CmxCur.-It was state& in The 'iTmcs about two months ago that the building committee appointed to superintend the re-erection of the newparish church at Doncaster had found themselves ander the. neoessity of appealing to the inhabitants of that town and, reighbourhood and the public generally for a further subsentpion of about 10,0001. to enable them to. compl*e the ediice, with the necessary internal fittings, exclusive of anL organ, for which provision is being made at a coet of about 3,001, and that with that additional sum tJey would be enabled to finish the entire work at the sum, originally specified-namely, 40,0001. The response to this appeal has been so liberal that the committee have ordered tho contractors to proceed with both the masonry and woodwork of the tower, and the former is alredy progresing rapidly. In the first plans of the architect, Mr Gilbert Scott, the body of the church was designed in the early decorated or geometrical style of architecture, and the tower in the perpendicular style. As the work proceeded however, Mr. Scott became gradually convinced that it was necessary to depart from his original idea of repeating the somewbat meagre perpendicular details of the old tower in connexion with a design which subsantially belongs to the geometrical style-that, in fact, to change the style t a particular level would be an affectation of a distinction of date where none exists in reality, and would make thetower the worst part of the new church, insted of the best,'as it was in the old edifice. This alteration will involve some additional expense, but the tower wili still be built for 4,1001., which is considerably belowr the price named in the& great majority of the tenders sent in 183 The effect of the new drawing is very superior to the former one, and itmay be safely asserted that the new tower will be one of the best in England, since it rill be higher than that of any other parish church in the country, and almost the only one of any great size in the style of te best period of architec ture. Mr. W. Forman, of London, and Pippbrooklhouse, Surrey, who has undertaken the entire restoration of tho south chapel of the ch^urch in very rich and elaborate detail, at a cost of upwvards of 6,000h, has recently sent a check for 001. towards the fnd for completingthe church, which Is thus raisd to within a few hundreds of the nmmum amount required Lord Palmerston last week kdndly forwardedacheck for 20 guineas. Itisfullyexpected that the masonry of the church will be completed by about this timenext year, but it is not probable that the edifioe iiU be ready for the formal opening for divine srvicoe before the, 28th of February, 1859, the anniversary of the destruction of the old church by fire. RPxoP?,LTonY ScHooTs.-At the Devon General Sessions, on Tuesday, Mr. Commissioner Bere, in his charge to the grand jury, stated that the Reformatory School forboys at Brampford.wood, near Exeter, at present contained' 26 inmates, and the institution was going on as properously as the trastees could expect. He was also happy to inform the jury that a more extensive estblishment for the refi"Tmation of girls was about to be erected in Exeter, and/t only 3001. more remained to be colleted,t a lagesm orthe new building having been obtained 'y private subdciptions. The necessity for this institution the learned commisioner showed by stating that at the last sessbns a girl of tender age was convicted of an offenoc, and there ias at. the present sesions a cbild of 12 years of ag for tria. She was a promising girl, but, being an orpha4, there r:s every probability of her being ruined if she was allowed to returx to her old associates again.v SUICIDE OF A. SURnOEO.-Yeeterday molning the coroner for West 10iddlesex reoived information. from the summoning officer of St. Pancras ofthedeath of Mr. Charles Stewart, surgeon, of Woburn.buildings, Woburn-place, who committed self-destruction by taing &. large quantity of prussic acid of the strongest possible character, on Tuesday evening last, under most painful circumStances It would appear that the unfortunate gentleman. had ben some time in practice, and wa man of some sldll and talent, and was always respeted by his neighbours anc fellow practitioners. For a hort time pest he has ben rather unwell, and at intervals rather excited. On Tuesday evening, between S and 9 o'clock, he was missing from his shop, and, his absence creating some alarm, a searcih wa made, and he was found in his bedroom inaninsendible, state, Assistance was called in, and life was pronounced to be extinct The case seeming Euspicous, a Search was. made, *uda bottle found which had contained prussi acid of tbe strongest quality, better known as prnssic acid o! Scbeele's strength, a very small quantity of which is sufficient to destroy life. Upon this the medical gentlema_ who had been sent for, on a more minute examination, dis. covered a strong smell of the poison froum the mouth; on-equently there was no doubt but tbat the unfortiuate, deceased had died from that poison. A.x Rox;sm DrmTon-A publio dinner was recently given to Mr. ;acdougal, Iernese, by iomj of the leading merchants in Glasgow. In 1837, from. a variety of unavourable ciruxance, Mr. Mac dougall had to place his affairs iix the hoads or~ 'his creditors. His liabilities were largep but the oomu. Fition offered was accepted, and Mr. Madougallssiea fulli discharge of the balance, aimounting to nealt ,0. This sum he has voluntarily repaid-an act whichh o destfly referred to as simply one of duty, but whil e o t'he flstteringtestimonia accorded to him by the nmrezcanta of Gasgw. ha lat prsentd b Si Jaes ampellia
