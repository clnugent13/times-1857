MO-YBY-MARKBI and CITYINTELLIGI(lOR. Wedresday Evenirg, tusinesa continues almost supendedin thefunsr aid under the immediate possibility of further serious news from India the tendency of the inarket is towards weakness. The first quotation of Consols for money was 90% to i, whence they soon receded to 90 to 3, from which there was no recovery. For the 14th of October the last transactions were at 90s to g. Consideting the near approach of the end Af 'the qiiarter, the demand for money in the discountmarket is light. India Stock left off at 210 to 212; India Bonds, 238. to 17s. discount: and Exchequerbills, 8s. to 4s. discount. In foreign stocks the purchases for investment have been rather numerous, wvile the speculative 'ransactions continue limited. The market generally is well supported. Mexican bave been negotiLted at 21i; Portuguese, 45 and 4&i; Russian Ylve per Cents., 1091, i,ard i; ditto Four-and-alalf per Cents., 98A;Lardinan 89i; Spanish, for the account, 40'; ditto, Deferred, for the account, 251 and I Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 94 and * the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 99k; Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 98j and 97 ; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 64*; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, lie corn-market was dull this morning at the decline of Monday. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were S7f. for money and 67f. 30c. for the end of the month, showing in the latter case a recovery of three-eighths per cent. About SO,Ooo;. in Australian gold was sold to the IBank to-day, and a simiar amount has been taken there in sovereigns, brought also by the Norfolk frem Melbourne. The further accounts from New York by the Atlantic continuo to show a disastrous condition of the money and stock markets, but at the same time tend to confirm the impression that, as regards the position of the mercantile community at large, there is no irremediable unsoundness. The pressure for snoney was beyond anything witnessed during the past 18 years, the rate of discount for good secondrate paper being as high an 36 per cent. Many large additional failures had taken place, but under the circumstances the number is much less than might have been anticipated. The principal cases included Allen and Son, cloth printers, of Providence, Rhode Island, for 300,0001.; Ileeveo, Abbott, and Co., iron manufacturers in Pennsylvania, for 160,0001. ; uludson, Robertson, tind Pulliam, importers of manufactus ed goods, New York, for 160,0001. ; F. G. Swan, warehouseman, for 240,0001; Stephen Colwell, an old iron rmerchant at Philadelphia, for 100,0001.; Bank of New Jersey for 40,0001. W. J. Bell and Co., money-dealers. New York; L. and V. Kirby, importers; and Fitzhugh and Littlejohn, of Oswego, largely engaged in the carrying trade. At the same time there had been a fu ther average decline of about 5 or 10 per cent. in the stook-market. Erie Railway was quoted 20 to +; Readig, 447; Michigan Southern, 21 ; New York Central, 70k; 'anama, 81; and Illinois Central, 93. A meeting of the Michigan Southern was to be held on the 25th inst., when a report from the Committee of Inquiry would be presented. The dishonoured ehecks of the Ohio Life and Trust Company were selling at Cincinnati at 30 discount. An instructive illustration of the working of the law of limited liability has been furnished in the case of the Manchester and Foreign Warehouse Company, which it was resolved on Monday last rhould be wound up. After an existence of 18 months a paid-up capital of 40,0001. has been almost entirely made away with, and there is even a possibility that an additional 10,0001., for which the sbareholders are responsible (the total subscribed capital being 60,000?.), may be required before the liquidation is terminated. The proceedings by which this rapid result has been brought about are known only partially, the one great desire of the victimized parties beiDg, of course, as in the case of the Surrey Gardens Company and other similar instances, to keep clear of the further damage they might sustain by allowing any appeal to be made to the Bankruptoy Court. But it appears that while the ruin was malking rapid progress the directors, in orthodox fashion, declared a dividend of 5 per cent. out o' profits. The affair tberefore is, probably, in all its features, exactly akin to the general run of those joint-stook developements with which the public liave been lately made familiar. It has, however, the peculiarity of having occurred under the Limited Liability Act; and as the (qually Tapid career of the Surrey Gardens Company under the same law has almost aimultancously been exposed, a question will naturally arise regarding the inferences it suggests as to the safety or value of that measure. Some of those who distinguished themselves by opposition to it will probably exclaim, " How can there be any question at al in the matter ? Here we see iniquities as bad as any that ever occurred ttnder the old system take place with a degree of speed never before wit- nessed, and which shows that the new law, while it. lhas no effect in driving rogues or incapables out of the field, by giving facilities to new and better nien, I operates as an inducement to the public to enter. 'with more levity than ever into such undertakings." But this would be a very superficial view, and the fact is that the circumstances of the cases now before tu', instead of affording an argument against the law of limited liability, are calculated to confirm all that has been urged respecting its advantages. Both these companies, as well as eeveral others of a like description which have quietly broken up during the last 8ix months, have been brought to a stand by the Pimple fact that the law of limited liability prevented them from getting credit, and that consequently when all the shareholders' subscriptions had been absorbed they had no choice but to suspend. If they had been comn panies constituted on theoldprinciple there would have been many atages before the avowal of insolvency. Money 'would have been borrowed on debentures, and credit -would have been eagerly given to the Board by speculators and tradesmen on the strength of the names of some half-dozen persons in the list of shareholders, who would have been marked out for ultimate prosecution to their last shilling and their last acre; and, instead of a rapid collapse, we should have had several years of .dlaming reports and high dividends, the final breakup being deferred to some convenient period of general pressure, wvhen it could be attributed to the operation of the Bank Charter Act, or any other cause except the true one. Other persons as well as the shareholders would then have been ruined, and the ternination would have been found only in a general and disastrous compromise. In the present case the shareholders alone suffer, and these, instead of being altogether consumed, have simply burnt their fingers and bought an amount of experience well worth the money. At this period any pity for ahareholders as a body would be preposterous. If they will quietly permit men who have declared dividends out of losses, or committed such other defaults or deceptions as have lately been common, to escape all punishment or even eensure, the conelusion must be that they rather enjoy their fate. Of course they do not like to lose their property, but the exercise of an approbative benevolence in letting off delinquent directors is evidently sufficiently ratlifvgto be looked upon as a compensatioi. 9harenolders, therefore, may be very weU left to pass their votes of approval, forward their proxies, and perform aU the other ceremonies considered prcper in such cases. If the public have anything to eay on the matter, it muSt be to complain of the demoralizing examplethusnet. It is the commaunity at large that are to be considered and for them at is plain that the law of limited' liability, by forcing every unsound concern to close its business as soon as it has ex.hausted the means of its voluntary dupes, is operating as favourably as could have ben desired. The folloving note purports to contradict the statement in The Times of Monday of a mutiny 13aving occurred among some Bomeay troops at D)harwar. The public are indebted to the writer for his endeavour to throw light upon the subject, but he should have been awrare that The !i'taes never gives culrrency to what he terms Stock-Exchange ca7ards. The information given consisted of the substance of a letter from a young officer at Bellary, in the Madras Presidency, dated August the 9th, vrritten while he was actually under or ers to start at midnight with a portion of his regiment for the scene of difficulty. This letter is at present in the hands of his relatives in Rent, but it can le obtained to-morrow, and shall then be pubLakhed:- "- Sir,-I observe in the money article of your paper of yesterdpy the statement of a rise having taken pLace among the Bombay trcops stationed at Dharwar on the 9th ult,, I ha e 0 t e ^ Iau rI W# ell it. ~~~~~~'im O t i mrl Stock Exohange cMnaofd, aiiCa6ni1i Maclean, who com- n11810o -at Dhar-far, tel'f4rAlk tO E034ayh tle .12th of niar~~d; at .Y on Avgtist that all'wa qn th i oh.t date, which despatch bas been forwardedto-his friends reaiding here.

DEOLUZE; a4, Colonel. "Cheltenbani, Sept. t A meeting of Venezuelan bondholaders 'was held to-day, Mr. J. D. Powles iX the chair, toreceive the report ofthe committeeanid' defido upbn their future proeeedings. The chairman obsrved thatin no similar case have such pereevering efforts been made to obtain a satisfactory adjustment, nor has so much forbearance been shown on the part of the creditors. Tt is uselesw, however, to carry on any further negotiations with the Venezuelan Government, when the treaty made by their own agents in January last is met with repudiation. Xo other resource is left to the bondholders than to call upon the Foreipn Secretary to obtain that justico for them which they cannot obtain tbemselves. A bondholder remarked that one of the principal difficulties in procuring a settlement with Ecuador and New Giranada arose from the bad faith of Venezuela. On the division of the joint loan among the three States, after they had established their independence, Venezuela took the smallest share, aud the Governments of the two other republics naturally pointed to her when pressed upon the subject of their engagements. A suggestion having been made to publiih the resolutions pamed at the meeting in the Venezuelan papers, bIr. Mocatta stated that the press there is completely coerced. The Government is generally unpopular, and maintained only by military force. Frightful disorder exists in the finances, and the domestic debt has been enormoudly increased. Unlesm some active steps are imnediately taken the Government obligations will become as valueless ag assignats. After some further discussion the following resolutions were adopted:- "That this meeting has lent with feelings of the deepest mortification and disappointment that the agrement s- lemz-Iy concluded on the 30th of Janu last betweei the conamissioners speciaDy appoinxted for that porpose by the Government ot Venezuela and tbe Commitiee of the Spanish American Bondholders in relation to the foredgn debt of Venezuela bad been repudiated by tbe Government of that republic. "I That the deoree of the Venezuela Government dated the 6th of May last, containing a proposal for the adjustment of the foreign debt of that republic, cozm3npIcated In a letter from the Secretary of Finance, dated 'Caraec J..e 22,' to M Hessrs. uth and Co., and by them trazsmitted to tho bondholders, be rejected by this meeting. "T 'hat the conduct of the Governmeat of Venezula in relation to its foreign debt, not only as respecs the said agreement, but during the whole course of the negotiations 'which bave been going on many years between the Government and the said committee, s been marked by a want of good faith and a disregard of the most solemn engagements. ' That the repeated breaches of faith by which the branches of revenue especially ypothecated to the purposes of tbe foreign debt have been withheld from the foreign oreditors, while the interest on the domestic debt has been paid, forces upon the bondholders the conviction that the Government of Venezuela has no serious intention of doing juslice to them. " That It appears to this moeting that to continue negotiations ior the liquidation of this debt under sueh circumnces is a mere mockery, and that as legal authority has declared tbat the case is one which on pubiho grounds clls for the active interference of the Britiah Governmentk the committee be requested to make a respectful representation of the whole of the circumstances to the Right Hon. the Earl of Clarendon, Hler Majesty's Principal Seoretarj of State for Foreign Affairs, and to solioit that his Lordship wi,14 on interuational grounds, undcr the strong circumstances of the case, take Euch measures as may be effetive to procure for the bondholdersthat justioe from the Govern. ment of Venezuela which they are unable to obtain for themuselves." At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day the examination meeting of the directors of the Royal British Bank was adjourned for two months,

THE BAStBRN COUNTIBS RALWA Y. ,TO THE. EDITOR OF THE TIMIES. Sir,-I appeal to your universally exercsed sympathy with distress in every shape to endeavour to obtwin some amelioration of condition for the unfortunate travellers on the Eastern Counties ailway. I write with feelings of agitation, 'which I oxnnot sa yet overcome, having only just escaped from a four hours?experience of the mostsevemr shaking it has been my lot to experienoe since early youth. Being necessarily, from circumistanoes, a second class pa. seger, and, while residing in this neighbourhood, having no option but to travel by the Eastern Counties line when business calls moe weekly to London, I feel that in. terest to comfort as well as nfsty calis upon me to state publicly, through your columns, the disgraceful state of this line. The violent rockincg of the carriages this evening wvas so inupportable that one of the unfortunate victims in the sama carriage as myself by the "down express," immediatelyon ourarrivalat the firsthilt (Bishop's Stortford) vent the round of the train, fancying that the motion was peculiar to our carriage ; but he returned, stating that the complaint was universal, and, moreover, that the more fre. quent traveUers complaiu that it is always the case. I myself have experienced it weekly for some time past, and, although of an easy disposition, confess that it is past endurance; for besides the danger which must exist with such violent rocking, being very destitute of natural clothing on my bones, the bodily pain I experienoe is far beyond a joke. The usually much coveted "corner seat" is shqnsed by an old stager on the line as though there was a live shell under it, for the unlucky ocaupant is sure, if he has no escape, to be made a most severe example of, kaud retire from it covered with brulses. One ady this evening was made quite as anveeU as though she had been making the voyage from Dover to Calais, and was thoroughly exhausted b"fore reaching Norwich, from the terrible trial she bad sustained for four hours. I cannot state the reason of this most unusaally severe maotion (for it is not wholy from bad coupling), bat it is either that the superstructure has too much play, or else that the raiis beinm wora the wheels are not suffilently confinod between them~; however, it is evident that danger in trAvelling must be inoreased by either cause, Frequently on other lihes, in the last ea-iage, there is when at great speed an Anpleasant swinging motion, but in the BEatern Countieg this pervades aU camages in the train alike, and if a person in health and strength suffers as much as I have dons what must be the position of an invalid or a sexagenaria ? I certalnly "Pitrthesomws of a pwor old man Wbose trembUng limba have brooght him to the doore of the Shoreditch station for a journey by the express train to NoFwich; but I can only add that if through your interference you csa "give relief," he will join with me (if he survive. the transit) in wlsglf that " Heaven ma bless your store. * I am, Sir, your aching and much-abused xorr-v,4 .:MJANLLibm, zopr, zi, ----------- VIAT6,.

EAST INiDUA.HOUss. A qurterlygeneraCoart of the EasttIndia Cmpany was hed yesterday at their house in Le&denball-streot, Mr. R. 1MAng .. dLP., Chairman of the Oourt of Directors, im The minutes of the list Court were readand coufirmed& Ta: RELI1Q FUND. Mr. DZNT a36E whether it was the intetion of the Coor' ofZ)irectorson the part of the Est India Company. to cotpi. ubab to the relief fand zow beitg raised for the sufferors fron. the mutinies th it ware flosr ragmgl,t India? The aba3ce, of the nsmes of the direotors from the xubsorlp'Aon lists lxhi been the subject of general remrk, anid those who u'rsi conoerned io the collection of-the fixed coud EAnot very ir comprehend the reason. eJ Mr. Lzwu- did not thtnk i pe }on roprietor had an rigbt to ask the Court of Dictors to subesribe to the fend because it was a most important question whether the Coznpany were not bound to pay the whole of the lou ises. alaned by the people in ItddtL (Hear, hear.) It was the dusty of every Government to protect its subjects, and tot to allow themn to be oeerran by mutinous troops. Aocordibe to the law of comnnonzensc, therefore, If they did not afforl 'the people this protetion they were re3ponsible for the injury that might be inflicted. His impression, therefore, was that the East India Government were bound to m&ke good all the losaes which had been sutained iA 'thisir ad outbrek The CGimi3uw, In answer to the question of Mr. Deot, bxgged to say that the Court of Direetorg had not yet eome tw any definitive decision on the subject;.iand, in repl-to. the obseyatimns of the hon. proprieo (ttr, L4wi ), would observe that the question was one of the utmos amportance, and had arisenfrom ciroumstanoes in referense-o which the history of the world formed no pArallel. It *as a question which must be referred to the law od satlo0a. There were but few precedeats bywhich they oonld beguidd. It was true a somewhat similar-ease occurred in the xaqrtha of England in 1745, which it would be the daty of the Court to conmider; but it must be admitted thst the present wee a case respecting which it could xot be dteraminA off hand PA to what- course ahotld or asould not be taren. Wha' the Coart had done in the matter wis this;-thev had writen to the Governmentldf India 'with inas,ructions to tlke exre that nobody nhouIl0b allowed to perish from want, and that no cae of desttiion within their rech ahvnldbe allowei to pas uprovided for. Thisassistance was- not to ba confioed to the servants of the Company only, but was to be extended to all laues th.t had sufrered. The Coart of Directort had alo intimae to their own covenanted servantis to ooaider that- the widaws and orphans of the offlioers who had been killed in this frihtful mutiny were entitled to the ame eompsaio'te a*Loance as was granted to"th widows*nd orphaxs of tchs who fell in the field. Mr. Dzr regretted thWt there should bE anJ dblqr In a matter of this kind. He might mention as a fact that as soon s it was intimated toeHer Majesty thate ch a y lef fund was being raised the omamitt recived an aswer by' telegraph from BalmokaI4ating that Her Majety antd the Prince Conisort would snbscribe. In the present easefthe dela appeared to ariw from- the neoessitryof a referenoa to a gher authority- but in this instance no differende of opinion oould possibly arise between the Court of Dire1tors and the anthorities in Cannon-row.. Au nPuwer might be telegraphed in a few minutes from that quarter, As to prooeaentst there were ma:ny-he might instnce the French inundatios and the Izish famine, when the mubbrfiptilos were prompt, and sr-ly the dreadful alamities resuting from tbe Indi mutinies required no consideration as to the absctlte neoe-sity of ffording stant reliet. He beaed to sk wbet%er there would be any objection to lay before the pub"c a copy of the despatch sent by the Court of Directors to aIdia on thi'ubject? - The CaAusr5tA said he oduld gire nou further srswer to the first question of the hon. proprietor thau he a already givehx; bt.t in regard to the second question, h begged to ay he had no objection to lay a copy of the dspatch before the Coopurtedtp.c efr Mr. JoNss hoped the Court of Directors would cese fronm their annual feasting during the present yer. The funds annally expended forx those feat amouted to between 3,0001. and 4,0001. a-ear. This sum oughtimmiditely, to be appropriated to the purposes of the Relief Fund. 4ayfeasting by the Court would, during this calamitous eass, be moot unseemly. The CHAsiR sidd it ws quite unnceary for the hon. uroptietor to dwll upon. what course might or might not bs unswemly, seeing that the Conut of Directors had not for a considerable time pest had any dinners such as,the hon. proprietor so much deprected. Mr. Lzwn thought the subjet tzeed tot b pursued auy further as experienoe iutified them in entertaining no, doubt tat the Court would act with the utmost propriety under the unfortuLnate circumtances atpresent existng in India. TheC xA wished lo say one word In rord to the despatch he had.promiled to lAy before the Court. He hoped no use would be made of it by whioh the channel of private charity might be -dammed tip. There was ample room for private benevolence to display itself In, whxtever cooure the Government might tAke; and he conld not conoeive a nobler opportunity for individual munifiosnoe than th resnted by the calamities they all deplored. (Hear, Tax R EsXiT,TUox O LSDIrA. ThIe CHAuia having called on Mr. James to bring forward the motion of which he had given notice, on the subject of the representation of the peoplo of India in this country, Mr. BROWN roe and appealed to, tbo hon. membor ihether, under exist' airctancee, it would not be better that he should refraitrom bringing forward his niotion. Ir. JoxEs declined acceding to the suggestion of the hon. proprietor, Mr. BRowN.-Ihen I move that this Court do nor ad. .3onrn. The CHAxnmAw.-I should be sorry that my hon. friend should persist in his motion for an adjournment; but at the ame time the hon. proprietor (Mr. Jones) most be aware that in the middie of Iis speech any hon. member might notice that there was not a sufficient attendance of members to oonstitute A Lun'um. r. BROWN.-And that is a right which I shall certtinly exercise, Ar. JoNEs was quite prepared for.all anch literruptions. He was awaro that he rcelved butvery littlo attention at any time from the great body of proprietors; but he might be Xloowed to say Ibat- he, lbad neveT-sald or done anything which could obstruct or impedo the progroes of gooi government In India. He knwe that even at this moment of auxious erpectation'cnthe art of the people of England, who wer e aNqrl7 ,ooking forurard to the result of their deliberatfon3, iC t us't the hd rhra of auy hon. proprietor to dissoTve fhe'Cdot But f! it were imagined that by adopting A h a s oarso, he sy h ould be Treventedi from bringing his motioh under discussion, he begged to undeceive the hon. proprietor' 'who might entertain ehat notion, and to asianre him that no other muotion should ever be di-' cussed in that Court until he had'had the prIvilege of say. log what he sought to say then. Therefore by stopping himt the -hon. proprietor would stop the whole bnsinesof the Court. (Hear, hear.) His motion was:- "Tha it is due to the adrancing sletlgenre of the people of India thAt a deputy from esch universit be maintained at the pubiSS expanse in this ocuntry, with a view to inform the prlopetos as b the com' plaints aud winsie of the peopie of IndlAs' Such was the substance of his motion, and ho believed tais was n opportune time for bringing it fdtxard. It was ttne there was a revolt in one part of India, but had they not two other portions of Indlia favourable to tlaeia? And it was by bringing forward such a motion as that which he now proposed that they might hope to cement' till more closely the combination that existed between England and those provinces not in insurrection. It would be showing th3 people of India that at least there were some who were ready to advocate their cause, and to plead for their ewstence as a nation, E3st India proprietors might not assemble at that court in large numbers; they might allow any ons of their body on someo pretence or other to dissolve the Conrt,-and even Government itself might not be able to collecttogetherin Parliamenta sufficient number of members to hear a discussion on Indian finances; while it was well known that when the Sattira question was mooted iln that Court the people of England generally took no part in it. But what was the case now H However supine might be the members of that Court, far different was the feeling now pervading the minds of tho people. I AU ws changed. The press vas fuU of intelligencefrom India; comments were proceeding from all quarters; Indi at lt had aed attention. She no longer remonstrated and pe theioned e groans of our slaughtered countrymcn and the shrieks of our ravished wives and daughters-these were the repsoaches at length cast upon the indifference of the propretors in that Court and the iudifference of the people of England at large, But this was DO thunderbolt that had faller. without premonition. Men of intelligence and wisdom had long endeavoured to impress unon the Indian Government their obligations to the people- of India. They had been able to foresee coming events, and had foretold that a day would arrive when rebeUion would check the aggressive polioy that had been so loug pursued. Annexation, no doubt, had been the whole cause of this outbreak. It -had been the explosive matter which daring a long period of time had been colected togetber til at last in the case of Otide it burst into a flame and zet on fire the whole extent of Bengal. Annexation was not merely the deposition of a Kin,g; but it ws the dislocation of all Iuereaxou ox TndAn soiey Anextin--sth div the relationsofItndiai'society. Armanxstiou Xas, the riv- ing away from the Court of the Sing the sons of the nobility; it was the redaction of thetetxdal nobleman into a country gentleman ; it was the disbanding of his retainers; it was reducin,g hima to a cipher who at one tIme was semlRoyal; It dostroyed the local tradesinen, who no longer received the Royal patronage, for annexation had caused dissolution of the Royal-houeehold. All these things had been done away; Europeans supplanted the - natives, and there was no loi,ger encouragement given to' local trade. True, we might yet introduoo a better system- of government, it was possible we might be able to do so, but during the progres3 a whole generatioa Mwa3t 3ass away, and meanwhile a spirit of diseontent ant biter enmity must prevail agLaitat us. Auonexatlo, he did not doubt, was the real cause of the flagrant outrage upon. human nature eo.ninitted bv Nena Sahib, one of the princi- pal leaders of these mutinies. But -had he not some cause forrebellion? Nothing in heaven, oa earth, or in heU could justify his conduct; bat still there was somethtng to bo found in the fact that '*e unjustly deprived him of his hereditary right as the son of the P'rime Minister of Sattara. The CAr.A rA,.-NO ! No ! Mr. BROWaN.-I now must move that the Court be coUnted. The Chairmnn then counted the number of proprictors present, and there being only 17-and 20 being required tD constitute a quoram-the Court was declared to be adjourned. Mr. LBw7N rsid, he sbould submit the following resola. tiou to the next quarterly Court:- " Tbat It is expedltnt thst this court do roconIdeir the gr.unds on wrich they granted a londoi of £50CO per sanum to the Wiarquia ot DAlbonese. and in,uira whetber the lisurrction which now ra;e ia India and the pre:et lo's or our ladian emptee are not mainly owiric 10 the mesres of tht M.1irqulsof Dlh.te, on ciown% o,FrhlIch ther EraDted the peasiou."

LOW'DON, 2mHUBDAY, S.EPTMBEB 24 1857 What is happening to us in India cannot be represented by any of the ordinary types of misfoitune. Earthquake, disease, mutilation, and 3uch natural images are employed to describe confusin, agony, prostration, and difficulty. But they suappose only a partial loss, or a degree of sifleriiig. In this instance the very thing that conhtituted our strength and our substantial cx istence is not merely injured and weakcned, nor does it merely disappear ; it is tirned against us; it has become our deadly foe and our imminent peril. We held India as a great military Power, and as a military Power we may be said at this moment to have ceased-worse than ceased, inasmuch as our own power is that a -ainst which we have to contend for existence. A disembodied army we know by our home experience may be a very harmnless thing. But in Inidia we are now realizing the metaphysical concep)tion of a body at war with the spirit, possessed with an evil spirit of its own, and fighting against its proper soul. Even MEZENTIUS did not imagine so }orrid an idea; and it would require the fantastic genius of DANTE to do it justice. To take ant ther more familiar simile. A short year since we trcd the deck of a mighty vessel, proud of i'. sirength, its vastness, its beauty, and, above all, its absolute and unshaken security. Year after year, alike in calm and in storm, under all p'-ssil le circumstances, it had borne us where we wished. In sacred phrase, it was that whlerein we trusted. We could not but trust it, and that confidence had become a second nature. AU at once it leaks, it fills, it settles down, it cra-hos, it bursts, it sinks in the waves. But it was that whereon we walked. It was our stand and footing. When it sinks beneath our feet we ar.e 1k ft helpless. In its faithlessness all is gone, for the present it least. Half an hour ago we were a floating city, a little State, a world of our own. Now we are drifting here and there in the waste of vaters, catching, if fortune favours, at a plank, a spar, a tub, or a hencoop. Perhaps a boat has been launched; more likaly it has been swamped or crushed; perhaps a raft has been hastily constructed, and half-a-dozen sailors are fighting for dear life against sun and storm, hunger and thirst. But this is all that remains of the noble craft that lately trod the waves like a thing of life. The Eastern story of the sailors who landed on a green island, made a fire, and began to cook their dinner, wheni the monster, as it turned out to be, went under and left them adrift, approaches to the case of a whole army in mutiny. But it onmy approaches, for the receding mass reappcars and forms itself anew into a fearful antagonist. Yet it is that which we created. Suppose FRANnEErSTEEr hunted down by his monster; suppose PRosizRo mastered by CALIBAN and his dirunken associates; and we have a faint image of our condition. The theory was that we held and governed India by means of itself. We are now at deadly issue with " itself," and have to destroy it by means of India. When that is done we have to consider how to hold and govern India for the fiuture, for the first instrument is gone. o 1o r tt such a mishap can be an object of deep and di!ipassioiiate interest to olur European neighbours. I ere is England, little England, so lavish of hor woriev, but so thrifty of her men, with an arn?- Ot qtuitries, which shortens the muster-roli burdlen the Army List,what will stie lo to replace the boasted weapon which %ho I)orrowed from India to turn against her ' 'Dire indeed must the extremity be wlfn tho first, thing to be done is utterly to destroy tlai which constituted our power, and when it can only be replaced from the same vitiated or susp2cted owaterials. Well, let us wait and see. L( t our neighbours have their say and speak out. Fronm their own mouths let us accept candid testiniony to the condition out of which we have to, enoorore. The event will show how we roally d'+ hold and govern India. The Bengal ar nuy is no more. A hundred thousand men are lost to ;:s, and the greater part are in arms against uis. That noble body of born and bred soldiers by the aid of which we have conquered and ajiexed 8o many rich territories and warlike tribes, and which dissipated in a few days] the dark clouid from the Punjab to which our European neoghhoxur had long pointed with expectancy, is uow sternly bent on numbering England in the long list of its conquests. If it was ever true that the native army was the whole, or nearly the whole, of our strength in India, then oiur empire would indeed be now in its last hour. But the world will shortly find they must give us credit for other resources and a stronger hold upon India than this one has proved to be. It is now said we have to reconquer India. That expresses the very nature of the task, though only half of it, for we have to reconquer India organized, disciplined, trained, armed, provisioned, fortitied, emboldened by ourselves. It is a task far greater than that which offered itself to us a century ago. We can only now succeed by the extraordinary prowess of the British soldier making up for the most fearful odds; and even that wtould nofv be utterly unavailing, but for another means equally the subject of invidious scepticism. We could not now march 1,500 miles right through India with a handful of men, opposed everywhere by a magnificent army of our own creation, and with every advantage of possession, unlems we enjoyed the confidence and goodwill of the native population. When we Tesume our position there, will our neighbours, who now tell Us candidly all is lost, then tell us as candidly how we have recovered it ? It can only be done by virtues wbich must then be conceded to us, with whatever reluctance. We must be a nation of soldiers; and, what is more, we must have the qualities for attaching to us those less powerful nations whom the fortune of war throws upon our hands. On this point, so far, the evidence of facts is most cheering. The mutineers have not the confidence or sympathy of the general population. The nstives plainly understand that the cause of cxder, security to life and property, religious libety, justice, and humanity, are involved in the Br-tish rule. We must not confound first appearancs Xor exceptional incidents with the evident tenour of their conduct, There are in India those who, in fact, war on the population, and at such a crisis do it the last injury of seeming to take its place. There are robber tribes who traverse India, sometimes on the move, and sometimes settled, by the chance of warand politics, in particular localities. There are military populations. There are still the immediate descendants of marauders who, within living memory, have won for themselves principalities, and some of whom can still muster men for any cause. There are all over India, as elsewhere, bad subjects, simple raffiams, men who live by light wits and light fingers. Carrying our British humanity with us, we have not followed the example of former rulers in disposing of such men summarily and finally; but we try them, give them every chance, and then put them In prison, where they are cared for and guarded at no small cost to the treasury. At every important station we have had several thousand such prisoners, and incredible numbers even at stations hardly known to thiz country. For all this century we have been engaged in the most incessant and laborious attempts to extinguish Dacoitee, Thuggee, prcfessional poisoning, and other systems and classes of crime. The mutiny has of course released aU these mischievous elements, which have immediately, and by a species of necessity, followed their natural instinct. The release of crowds of murderers and robbers from prison, the flocking of others from the villages, and the stimulus given to latent roguery by the prospect of plunder " beCC yond the dreams of avarice," and absolute license for everything bad, would account for almost any extent of outrage in most places in the world. But in India there certainly is a good deal of innate barbarism which ages of gaudy magnificence, grotesque poetry, and dreamy metaphysics have not smoothed away. AU history there, public or private, is a catalogue of horrors. Massacres, assassinations, generally of the most treacherous kind, tortures, usually for the discovery of supposed treasure, long-cherished revenges, and extensive conspiracies, have there constituted the ordinary tenour of events. Every Indian rajah or gentleman has looked upon the British as very dull fellows, with no relish for this kind of sport, and has hated them for standing guard between uncles and nephews, between the children of different wives, the partisans of rival viziers, and all sorts of people who would otherwise long ago havo disposed of one another after their own fashion. All this has broken out, and the saying of " Hell let loose" does not mean more. But, nevertheless, there is a simple, industrious population, attached to their homes, struggling hard for life, who have found England their friend. They see and feel that we are humane, just, and true. They see that life and property are safer under us than under the tyranny of the Moguls or the utter lawlessness of the Mahrattas. They are on our side. As a rule, the villages have not risen against even our poor fugiiives. The narratives of escape must, indeed, be read with care, in order to distinguish between the ac!s of ordinary villagers and those of mutineers, professional robbers, and disorderly tribes. Even at this moment, when we may be said to have lost al the North-Western pro- vinces of Hindostan, xexept a few stations, and whon 70,000 men are in arms against us, our relations with the country at large are just as usual. From the walls of Delhi all the way to the Sutlej, on the west, and the Himalayas on the north, our communications are uninterrupted; we have the services of men and cattle at our command; we have supplies as abundant and cheap as before the mutiny; and to all military purposes the country is our own. With few exceptions the native chiefs befriend us, give shelter, carriage, and escort to our fugitives, and do this without expecting to offend their immediate neighbours. Here, then, we have that resource which is stronger than the sword, and which some people have been slow to credit us with-we have a secure place and a solid foundation in the confidence of the people. Thatremains when the army of Bengal has turned against us; and by it, as well as by British prowess, we shall speedily recover our position in India.
The sympathies and interest of the nation have recently been so absorbed in the fortunes of General HAVmLoCK and his troops on their advance from the lower provinces of India, that attention has been somnewhat diverted from the spot which at first arrest'd tfli thoughts of all. The siege of Delhi, however, by the latest accounts still proceeded, and though the operations to which that term is rather loosely applied have not yet been directed towards any imucediate or decisive result, they have been muccessfilly conducted, and have probably tended upon the whole as much to the advantage of the Government and the damage of the rebellion as any tactics which could have been adopted. It is not to be denied that the occupati,n of this famous city was a piece of great good fortune for the mutineers. Delhi is the only town of Ilindostan where the ancient fortifications have been kept in repair, and these defences-not very considerable in themselves-have been strengthened by some additions from British engineers. Of Btill greater importance to the revolters was the Arsenal, which supplied them with guns for the ramparts, with abundant ammunition, and with alt the small arms they could require. The Treasury, too, was richly stored, and in general opulence, population, and resources the city had no superiorin native India. To these advantages we may add that of its position, which was in the very focuis of disaffection. The adjacent provinces represent the cradle and hotbed of Eindostanee fanaticism. It was from these parts that the high caste Sepoys were drawn, and the revolters accordingly when established at Delhi found themselves exempt from any such popular hostility as their brethren experienced in the Punjab. Yet, notwithstanding these favourable conditions, it is indisputable that the balance of advantages has been on the side of the Government. At first, of course, the march of our forces upon Delhi was suggested by the natural and instinctive desire of closing at once with the enemy in the quarters where he was to be found, but when it appeared that the strength of the mutineers precluded the idea of an immediate assault, and our own position had been taken up outside the city, the value of such a position became speeaily visible. As this inaction itself presumed such a numerical inferiority on our side as rendered it expedient to wait for reinforcements, it is obvious that under such circumstances the conditions most desirable were that we should be as near as possible to our source of succouLr, preserve our communications uninterrupted, and engage the largest amouat of the rebel force while maintaining ourselves in security and good plight. All these conditions were satisfied by our encampment before Delhi. The Punjab, as we explained the other day, promised more speedy and more ample reinforcements than. could be expeoted from Calcutta. It contained some 10,000 European soldiers, with a population destitute of all sympathy with the revolters, and was under energetic government. At the first outbreak, indeed, of the mutiny the only effective communication which our commanders could maintain was with Sir JoH? LAwnRENE, who was then at Rawul Pindee, and but a short time elapsed before troops were pushed across the Sutlej to the support of the Delhi force. Recently the complete pacification of the Punjab has enabled its authorities to despatch succours in considerably greater numbers, but of all the large reinforcements which it wa i expected would reach our camp in the course of last month the chief part by far would have proceeded from these districts. Our communications, too, in this direction have been admirably maintained. On the western banks of the Jumna the Hindostanee element begins to lose its predominance in the population, and the Sikh chiefs on this side the Sutlej who have been for some time under British protection have thrown themselves into the cause of Government and order with a cordiality and faithfulness leaving nothing to be desired. In some instances they have brought their retainers to the camp in person; in aU they have provided us with unfailing and invaluable supplies. The result is seen in an open and secure line of communication with the Punjab and its resources. At one time the rebels had succeeded in occupying the cross road from Delhi to Meerat, but Meerut itself, Mozuffernuggur, Umballab, and all beyond and around we still hold and control, while, at the same time, the comparative proximity of such a force as that at Delhi reacts with a certain beneficial effecs on the Punjab itself. Our position has, by these circumstances, been rendered extremely favourable to the health and spirits of the men; and the reader, indeed, had an opportunity of observing, from some letters which we published on Saturday last, to what a remarkable extent these advantages had been developed. Not only were "supplies as " plentiful and cheap" in the camp " as they " would be in the best regulated cantonments," but the condition of the troops was quite extraordinary. " Several of the regiments," continues the writer above quoted-a staff officer of rank, "are positively healthier, the commanding officers "tell me, than they probably would be in canton"ments." An Artillery officer, writing also from the camp, and about the same date, tells a similar story. " The men," says he, " I think look well, "much more so than I have often seen them look "at this season of the year in cantonments , and in correspondence which we have ourselves received it is noticed as matter of common observation that officers usually delicate and ailing appear strangely robust, and that when depression and alarm pervaded other quarters the camp before Delhi was the scene of unbounded vivacity and confidence. All this while we are occupying, with a force which, up to the latest advices, probably never exceeded 2,500 European infantry, at least ten times that number of the rebels ; nor does this fact reprcsent the whole of the advantage here derived, for Delhi has attracted and absorbed almost every fresh batch of traitors as soon as their revolt had been declared, and has thus engaged under the least injurious circumstances all the most resolute and disciplined of the mutineers. Without this centre of attraction they might be spreading revolt and anarchy in all directions, whereas at present they are quietly engulfed within the walls of Delhi, and either expended in fruitless attacks upon ourposition or reserved for the day of retribution in prospect. Whether it may have been thought advisable in the progress of events to exchange this position for another is of course a point for conjecture only, but it must be plain, we think-, that advantages of no ordinary kind have attended operations producing results like these. Let it be remembered that we commenced with a great numerical inferiority of force, that our policy necessarily assumed a defensive character for a time, and that the season was the hottest of the whole Year. It is perfectly true that we have not been besieging Delhi, and not even investing it, so that our proceedings may be so far regarded as deprived of any definite object. But it is also true that we have occupied the largest possible portion of the rebel force with tho least possible loss to ourselves, and that the principal army representing the strength of Government in the disaffected districts has maintained its ascendancy without a single reverse against aU the efforts of the revolters. It is even affirmed, as our readers have seen, in the majority of communications from the spot, that Delhi, as far as its capacity for immediate resistance was concerned, could be stormed at any moment we pleased; nor is there any improbability in the assertion, considering that an enemy at least half as powerful as the Delhi garrison evacuated both Cawnpore and Bithoor before HAVELOcK and his men. We abstain, however, for the present from entering into these speculations, but it will be clear, we think, to all, that whether the reinforcements from the Punjab have induced our commanders to order the assault, or whether considerations of other kdnds have suggested the removal of the army, our position before Delhi, under all the circumstances, has been attended with excellent gervice to the cause of Government.
The lettera that we receive daily folowing in the wake of the "YOUNG E;GLISMANt " would fill our whole space were we to insert them all. We are obliged to limit our selection, hut the fact shows how large an amount of enthusiasm now exists, and what materials the War Department has at its command, if it can only devise some plan by which it can avail itself of them. Only lay down the outline, and there can be no doubt that there will be a rush to fill it up. Let some Corps be arranged with such rules and conditions as will suit the class now anxious to volunteer, and the skeleton wil soon be covered with good sound flesh and blood. There are, of course, details to be considered. ShaU the Corps select its own officers, or any proportion of them, i subject, of course,. to revision by the War-office *! What shall be the standard of pay ? What shall be the rule with respect to promotion frorA the Corps to commissions in the Line I One cor,' respondent suggests a small annual percentage chosen by the Corps itself. Must the outfit be! provided ? Some correspondents suggest that the present would be a good opportunity of raising a I volunteer cavalry corps as well as an infantry one. The present emergency brings up the old comparison between the rival claims and uses of enthusiasm on the one side and the professional: military temper on the other. This is an oldl question, which perhaps never will be settled. There is the fighting enthusiast whose ardour is. kindled by the circumstances of the particular war in which he fights, whose indignation has! been inflamed by some great wrong, and who,| not being a HAMLE.T, or having his spirits subdued,' his energies depressed, and his ox-pectations damped by any generalizing philosophy, thinks he can set this wrong right by fightiDg. This is a true charac'er of Nature's own moulding, and, more-| over, there is a great deal of truth in the viewI which this character takes. Many wrongs cannot be ! set right by fighting, but some can be set right in'! this way alone. There was a great wrong committed when Russia crossed the Danube four years ago and took possession of another Power's territories, and that wrong was set right by fighting. There is a great, an enormous wrong in India so long as an' army of criminals, ruffians, and rebels lifts up its head in that region, and, after wholesale' murder aDd the most atrocious insults to English men and women, is still, though! not triumphant, on a level with us by dint of sheer uPperiority of numbers, besieging our garrisons, blocking up our roads, and effacing for the time being and as far as the mutiny extends our rule and empire. This is a wrong which can be remediedI by fighting, and accordingly large numbers are now *oming forward and expressing their ardent desire , 'obe allowed to go to India and fight for this i bject. It must be observed that the motive to' ihis species of military service is, as distinguished, from the permanent one of the more regular soldier, a temporary motive, and that the time of service' natvrally coincides with the nature of the motive. Our Volnmteer is a soldier for a particular object, and he feels a mission or vocation to fight for obtaining it; but the object attained, his mission is over, unless his general plans of life have undergone a change in consequence of his limited taste of war. This is the spirit, the character, and the kind of service which the creation of a Volunteer Corps would call forth, and the kind of service is undoubtedly an effective one. All facts go to show that enthusiasts fighting for a particular object, and with their heart in the work, fight well. It is true these Volunteers will not have had the long training of regular soldiers, but it must be remembered-and we suggest the con-! sideration to a military correspondent, who speaks somewhat disdainfully of " a regiment a month " old"-that gentlemen and educated men apply a much quicker apprehension to their new lesson 1 than the rank which supplies our common soldiers I does. Our military correspondent suggests home service as the object of a 'Volhnteer Corps, in the place of direct service in India, in order to release our eight North American regiments. But to that suggestion we say, No. That might be a proper object for the formation of a Volunteer Corps, but if a Volunteer Corps is formed for the express aim of Indian service-if the special motive is to go and fight this murderous and insolent host that presumes now to threaten our Indian rule, let that motive have its play, and do not let it be checked. These men would not enlist to stay at home; that would be a different thing altogether. And, as we say, all experience goes to show that these men wiU fight well. They might have the advantage of all the new I varieties of arms, might all carry revolvers, &c., and might form a corps dcUlite which would have a useful influence over the Regulars. Indeed, it is impossible to say what military genius might not be elicited out of such materials, for nature some- I times adopts eccentric and amateur coiurses. She has before now passed by Sandhursts and Wool- wiches, and taken a General from an unprofessionala quarter. We cannot create genius by any system, or training, or art whatever; it is the production of nature; but we may give opportunities for nature to show itself, and we may vary and enlarge' those opportunities. We have been advocating here one sort of military spirit and service, because it is the one which the present emergency is specially adapted to draw out, and is, in fact, drawing out. On the other hand, there is the regular military man, who has adopted war as his profession, and who must, of course, be regarded as the staple instrument in any war. 0 We know the . advantages which he possesses over the amateur, nor do we underrate his zeal either, be. cause it is a more professional one. Btut the fact is we have room for bosh kinds of service, and both kinds of soldiers. We want the Regulars, and we want the Volunteers. We know that regular military men are apt to depreciate this military enthusiasm wbich is connected with special objects, but we see no gocd reason for doing so. Enthusiasm is beyond all doubt a powerful engine' in any cause whatever, in any business, in any game. It makes men speak well, write well, work well with head or hand, hunt well, shoot well, fish well, and, last, though not least, fight well. We cannot afford to lose such an ally and such a stimulus. If knowledge is power, feeling is power too. Hlere are numbers coming forward and offering zealous temporary service. When such a spirit as this pervades large classes, we must pause before wve reject it as an auxiliary, for we cannot tell how much reinforcement it will bring. And it must be remembered that such a spirit grows with encouragement. We ]mow that such service answered in America, and that the success of the Mexican campaign was largely indebted to it. We know that X, e were driven to make the experiment ourselves during the last war, and actuaUy raised a foreign Volunteer Corps. It cannot, then, on general grounds be so very hazardouis an experiment to make, and it is the less hazardous now, because the invitation to it does not come from the Government to the people, but from the people tbeniselves to the Goyernment.

THE r.ITBD STATBS. (PROM 01O1 OWN COPkREPOND2N.) NEW YORK, SmPT. 12. The long pending negotiations between New Grenada and the United States have ended-the mountain has brought forth a mouse of an indemnity treaty. The people murdered in the Isthmus riots are to be paid for, those wounded are to be indemnified, and a commimion is to sit to debar. mine who were killed and who were wounded, and how much ought* to be paid in each case. The great political questions of difference are loft as before-or rather worse than before-for discussion having been broached, and the parties having failed to agree, each party wiU have the pleasure of adhering aU the more firmly to its own views. The State of Panama laid, and still lay claim to levy a capitation-tan on passengers from the Eastern United States to the Western passing through its territory; a severe tonnage-tax upon the shipping of the United States coming to the transit ports; a heavy impost upon the goods passing in transit; and onerous postal charges upon the mails fromNew York to California. The right to levy these rates, which have been resisted by the United States, is left unsettled. This Government wiU not suomit to them. It avows that it considers all these questions settled by existing treaties, and if the New Grenada authorities are so unwise as to provoke the question there will be every disposition to enforce the American construction. They say that before American capital flowed through the Isthmus to the shores of the Pacific the track now travelled by the looomotive was a wilderness, the aite of Aspinwall a deadly swamp, and the streets of Panama overgrown with grass. The liEe and the wealth which it nor, possesses are the offspring of American enterprise. It is not right that after having done so much for the country capital and enterprise should be stiU further taxed for the support of a set of lazy fellows who have not energy enough to take care of themselves. But they say further, we are not obliged to fall back on the natural rights which the comity of nations gives to every Power. These questions have already been determined between the two countries by existing treaties, which the United States wfill enforce. New Granada, on the other hand, plays lamb to the American wolf, with this trifling exception, that it stands above the wolf in the stream The "hard timues" s'll continue. Each day some new failures are announced. It would be worse than useless to burden your columns with the unknown names. The banks have been for a few days back discounting more freely, but money is still in so great demand that holders of excellent investments are obliged to throw them on the market and sacrifice them at present prices. The Bank Stocks are now feeling the effect of the pressure in this way. Bank of Commerce shares, for instance, which commanded 108 not long ago, now sell at 9o,and other banks in proportion. In fact, everything is locked up. Since Mfichigan Southern and Ohio Life and two great boorrowers are out of the wray the market ougoht to be easier, but the effect of their stopping has been to create such a want of confidence that business is carried on with difficulty. The dry goods people are the first to feel the pressure. I think I have several times pointed out to you that they would probably have trouble this autumn-though in saying this I certainly have no wish to claim to be a Cassandra, or to have foreseen the present state of things. Considering it as I do entirely unreasonable, without a suflicient cause for its intensity, I have no wish to claim the demerit of having been its prophet. To go back to the dry goods dealers, they are at present the heaviest sufferers, and in the worst repute. The produce dealers staud next. Flour must fall. The may try to keep it up by combination, but with a great crop in Europe and a great crop in the West oombinations Will be useless. At present the home crop is stationary, both because nobody has money enough to move it, and because all interested in it are disposed to hold on for higher prices. But that state of things cannot last long. The wheat must come to market, the railways must have the transportation, the farmers must have money to pay their grocers' bills and for their wives' dresses-the first end of the house that Jack built. And when the crop gets out bread will be cheap,-the first and surest sign of returning prosperity. On the whole I think things look better than when I last wrote; and could one foresee the course of Indian contest and the effect of the New York cramp upon extended Western credit, we might be disposed to think it sunshiny. The Banks are discounting more freely, and their specie reserve has increased nearly $3,000,000, and wil show on Monday between $12,000,000 and $13,000,000. Specie keeps flowing in here from the country. So far as the moneyed institutions are concerned they feel decidedly better than a week ago. The two things T have alluded to n'oove give the principal reason for fear in the future. New York is not so very expanded for the amount of its capital, nor is its real estate swelled to fabulous prices. But there are little towns in the West where every man considers himself worthahalf-a-million (in building lots), and gives his obligations accordingly. A tumble down there may react ihjuriously upon New Ydrk; but in no respect as it did 20 years ago. This country is now solidly prosperous; and though, as in all times of prosperity, there will be over-trading, over-speculating, over gambling, and following checks, revulsions, and failures, and though even some solid fortunes may tumble with the gorgeous palaces and cloud-capped visions of the gamblers, the great agricultural districts are far richer than ever before, the commercial towns have much more accumulated capital than in any former crisis, the manufacturers are rich, and the accumulating capital of a single year can wipe out all the indebtedness that presses heavily-can, that, is if people, instead of foolishly faling helpless in fright, will pit on a gentle but steady curb, and check instead of stop. As to the other cause, the Indian troubles, they are regarded here with an interest second only to that which they excite in London. We have no sons fighting, no daughters being massacred, but the intercourse between the two countries has been so intimate that there are few American gentlemen have not more or less acquaintances in the British army. And, even without the excitement of personal interest, no human being can read without emotion the stories of the savage atrocities perpetrated in India. The commercial effect, too, of the revolt is felt here almost as soon aM in London. Long ago the electric wire of mutual interestwas laid between these two great monetary centres. I subjoin an article from the Arew York Hea7d of this morning, which I believe expresses the views of this whole country:- " We oopy from the Richmond W7ig an articlo on the Mahomedan revolt in India whiol speaks encouragingly of the chances of its suppression. Oar contemporary cannot see why a nstion whioh subsidized all Europe to fight its battles against republican Franco-which from 1803 to 1812 tood alo4o with Spain and Portugal aganst 13 - pe, an I which from 1812 to 1815 was able to stand 'annuilWa exenditure of more than 100,000,OOO., should be oblg to yild its Indian empire to the feeble Aslatlos from whom It wrested it. Neither can we. There is nothing in Great Britain's present oiroumutaoes which would seem to justy the dlightest despondancy on this core.

THE LATE MURDER IN LEInu WOODS, NsiIt BBISTOL.-The unfortunate woman who was found mur. dered in Leigh Woods on the night of the 11th inst., aud reference to whose case has been made almost daily since tho occurrence in The Times, has at last been satisfactorily identified, and circumstances have trans ireed which render the speedy captute of the murderer almost certain. The deceased, whose name is Charlotte Pugsley, was formerly in the service of the H,n. MIrs. Hutchinson, of Dorset Hoouse, Clifton, and on that lady leaving England for Ireland Pugley obtained a situation in the family of Mrm. Cave, of Dovnend, and afterwards with a lady named Western, of Rivers-street, Bath. On the death of Mrs. Western the deceased entered the service of the Rev. G. Bythesea, of Freshford, with whom she had lived nearly three months as head cook. She had recently given noticeof herintention toleave, stating thatshe was about to be married to a man named Beale, who had formerly been a fellow-servant with her, and that after her marriage they were about to emigrate. On Wednesday, the 9th inst., Beale came to the house of Mr. Bythesea about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, for the purpoee of taking his intended wife away with him. She had tbree boxes, one covered with blak leather, and the two others with different descriptions of paper, all of which were covered with a coarse kind of wrapping, corded, and directed " Mr. Beale, passenger to Bristol." After tea Beale and the girl Pugaley took leave of the servants, and proceeded to the Limpley Stoke Station of tho Wilts, Somerset, and Weymouth Railway, whence it is believed they st%rted for BristoL It is known that the de. ceased had with her about 7& in cash, and there is also reason to believe that she had previoudy remitted some mouey to Beale, who was hving in service in the neighbour. hood oN Northampton, to enable him to come down and join her at Freshford. Yesterday morning Inspector Norris, of the Bath police force, accompanied by a fellow-servant of Charlottc Pngsley's, came to Bristol for the purpose of seeing the clothes of the deceased and giving other information. This young woman having detailed the facts before stated as to Pursley having told her of her intention to get married, Beale a * isit to Freshford on the 9th, snd their departure on the evening of that day, identified the clothes of the deceased as being beyond all doubt those of Cbarlotte Pugaley. She reoognized the stockings as a pair which sbe had herself mended for the deceased, and a pair of Coburg cloth aleeves with crape rnche, which the deceased had put into her dress on the day before leaving, as she said she considered the sleeves ofthe drees were not loug enough. The other articles of dress also corresponded with those worn by Pogpley when she left Freshford. Wlith re. spect to the bonnet and cape, which have not been found, it is stated that the deceased wore when she left a black Orleans cape, rather large, trimmed with black braid, and lined with black lining. She had on a speckled straw bonnet with groen rlibuds, a curtain edged with erape and a border of white net, with narrow pink riband. In her boxes there wero also several shawls and a slk cape. In addition to the testimony of the fellow servant of Pugaley, a laundres vwho had washed for her for years clearly identflese the under garmnents Acting upon the information thus gained the police are using strenuous exertions for the apprehension of the Supposed murderer, for whose conviction the Homue S3ecretary has offered a reward of 10O0., writh a free pardoix to any accomplice not being the actual perpetrator of the CiRYSwU PA xCL-ONX SHIULNhO DAY, Wednee day.

SECOND EDITIO N. TEE TIMITES-OFFICE, Thursday Morning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Wednesday), 6 p.m. It is not very unusual for persons of a saugaine and imaginative temperament to dwell upon an hypothesis until they fancy it proved, and proceed to reason upon it as earnestly as if it were an established and incontrovertible fact. An instance of this sort has lately occurred in the case of a purtion of the French press, which, while considering, and perhaps exaggerating, the extent of our Indiani diffi. culties, and at the same time underrating our means of surmouniting them, has come to the hasty conclusion that, sooner or later, we shall have to seek aid from France, and has even got so far as to speculate on the terms upon which it may be granted. On the part of the Legitimist papers there was nothing astonishing in this unfriendly haste to profit by a neighboufrs misfortunes to drive a good bargain, but it may well excite surprise wheu the frendly Siacle out-Herods our habitual foes in its desire to make of England's difficulty France's opportunity. The most rabid of our opponents, when anticipating, without the slightest grounds, an application from England for succour, stipulated S;terms usurious enough, and, at one stroke of its catholic quill, swept us out of the Mediterranean; but at least it gave us something in return for Malta, Gibraltar, and the rest. A French army was to go and re-establish us in our Oriental possessions. Of course we felt a proper amount of gratitude. We by no means underrate the valiue of the proffered aid, nor doubt that in Hindostan, as in the Crimea and wherever they have fought, the French would prove themselves most gallant and useful soldiers. But there is such a thing a3 waiting till you are asked, and of this we may remind those who appear to forget the history of the present century, and the power and resourcea disployed by Great Britain when opposed to Europe combined against her by one master-mind and seemingly resistless hand. They may be quite sure that the British nation, since then enormously Increased In numbers and wealth, has lost none of its energy or patriotism, and that by the exertion of these it is well able, without seeking foreign assistance, to vanquish even greater difficulties than the very serious ones that have arisen in the East. To return, however, to the SiMec. Notwithstand. ing the guarded and friendly terms in which it is couched, there is only one meaning to be attributed to the article I have referred to, and that is, thaS now would be a good time, when England has her hands full, to press for a revision of the treaties of 1815. The article-which is nominally suggested by the interview of Stuttgard, taken as a peg on wrhich to hang an iteration of some of the least sensible and practical of the ideas usually advocated by the Siecle -is considerably weakened by the fact that it starts from suppositions, unsupported by proof, and opposed to what is at this moment generally believed to be the truth. The meeting of the two Emperors, it commences by saying, " puts the whole political world of ELurope in a flutter ; it is thought with reason that these two chiefs of powerul nations do not quit their dominions merely to shake -eaah other by the hand. Two Cabinets especially appear greatly preoccupied by the interview, and those are the Cabinets of St. James's and Vienna." That the political world, diplomatic and journalistic, should find matter for speculation in the interview of the Emperors, especially at a moment when scarcely anything of interet is going on inEurope, is not very surprising, but theSicle exaggerates the importance generally attributed to the Stuttgard meeting, which is looked upon as a mere amicable demonstration, and not as a grave political event. Such is certainly the prevailing impression here. Of course there have been plenty of conjectures andreports. It was said that a reduction of standing armies would be the principal subject brought forward, but this blew over as a mere rumour, and the fact is that the French army is already reduced as low as is consistent with a proper regard to the internal tranquillity of the country and the necessary occupation of Algeria. As to the English Government's being vivemeod proceip with tho interview, it would be rather interesting to know whence the S'ie got that piece of information. The intended meeting at Stuttgard was known of, although the period was not fixed, before the Emperor's visit to Osborne. Neither then nor since did it cause the least sensation on your side of the Channel, nor does there seem reason to believe that the English Government attaches more importance to it than the English public. The assumption, however, leads off an article with good efoe, and gives the writer an opportunity of informing us why the British Cabinet is thus uneasy. It fears that the friendship engendered by the Stuttgard meeting may be so much deducted from that prevailing between France and England; "it fears also, perhaps, that by a just requital of things here below France may be tempted to profit by the uiifortunate circumstances in which Great Britaini finds itself." Your Paris contemporary cannot be supposed, however deserving of the distinction, to be in the confidence of the English Government, so that one must take this as its own estimate of the probabilities. An assurance, however, shortly folowa that the French Government cainot have the wish to alienate the English alliance, and then succeed some expressions of goodwill and of a desire to maintain that alliance, whose sincerity I do not doubt, although they are practically inconsistent with the aspirations intimated in other parts of the article. I extract the next passages:- 'As to profiting by the embarrassments of Great Briii, the straiglitforward, and sometimes a little too chivalrous, character of our nation is a sure guar,antee to her that sho has not to fear unhandsome conduct; but that in the arrangoments that rnight take place in Europe, the French Govern' ment should ask her assent, and in case of need, her devoted co-operation, to obtain just satisfaction, that might well be -we will even say, with our liberty, free from all Governmental responsibility, that ought to be. And the statesmen of Englaud would have too strong a reeling of what is equitable not to agree that, Iu11814 and 1815, Europe abused of victory, and that reparation is due to France. The Si&,le said, a ftw days ago, that thix repation ought to be the fruit of the alliance and not tho fruit of war." With Austria the Sicle deals summarily enough, as far a- condemnation goes, but does not fix the punishmiient to be inflicted on her for her ingratitude to Rus.ia, and indifferent faith towards FranceNevertheless it throws out a hint "If we thought that our wbhes might be heard, oh I then, we would not hesitate to express them, and we should be agreed with all those who have patriotism in their hearts and sincere sympathy for oppressed nations. We know how to make allowance for the difficulties which the firmest vrill. may encounter in such deliate and numerous questions; I yot FraLce has recovered her indlnence in the councils of Europe, and the chief of the Government is not ignorant of what the nation desires." This evidently points to the liberation of Italy. The " reparation due to France" can only mean a rectification of the frontier-In other words terri- torial aggrandizernent the old object of ambition of the party to which the Sie belongs. It is a pity that the Si&-e should allow itself to be thus run away with by its hobbies. If it really prizes the English alliance it will not wish to see France seeking revision of the treaties of 1815 or aiming at a reconstruction of the map of Europe. Such attempts would only be the signal of fresh calamities for a country that has certainly had its full share of them. The Emperor left Chalons camp for Luneville at 2 this afternoon. To-morrow he reviews the troops at Luneville, and proceeds to Strasburg. He will review the garrison there, and reach Stuttgard on the 25th, will leave on the 28tb, retarn by Forbach and Metz, and be back at the camp on the 29th. Count Walewski arrived in Paris yesterday and left early this morning for the camp. The Russian Ambassador and suite leave Paris this afternoon for Stuttgard, for which place the Minister of Wurtemberg will leave to-morrow morning. The Duke of Cambridge has returned to Paris. The brig-of-war Railleur, which has just sailed from Brest for New Caledonia, had on board several convicts sentenced transportation, who are to be landed at the island of Pines, where a provisional penal settlement has been established.

Three Russian screw corvettes were at the Dardanelles on the 15th inst., waiting for a firman to enter the Black Sea.

A telegraphic despatch from Stukttgard, dated Wednesday, Sept. 23, says:- "1 The Czar Alexander is expected here on Thursday evening; the Emperor Napoleon on Friday morning. They will give a grand banquet on that day, and an evening party at the Prince Royal's country seat near Cannstadt. " On Saturday the august visitors will pay a visit to the Royal breeding stud at Hohenhein, and will attend an evening party at Wilhelmschloss, the gardens of which Regal Palace will be illuminated. " The Minister of Foreign Affairs will have an assembly the same evening of all the members of the diplomatic corps. " The festivities will terminate on Sunday by a gkand banquet at Court, and a gala spectacle at the theatre. The Emperors will take their departure on Monday morning." ITALY. (mROM OUR OWN COORRSPONDMT.) TURDh, Smv. 2L The Prince de la Tour d'Auvergne, the new French Minister at this Court, is expected here today from Florence, and the Duo de Gramont will leave this for Paris in the course of the week. The weather has lately become settled again, after having been broken for some time, and the warm days and cool nights of the last week have exercised a most beneficial effect on vegetation, it is said. The maize crop is in the most perfect state. This crop, which is of so much importance to the rural population, wDl, it is now asserted, produce more than an average yield. In the Romagna there has been a long drought, and the want of water for irrigation had in some degree been injurious to the rice there, but from Lombardy and the Lomelllna the accounts of this crop are highly satisfactory. Many proprietors have great hopes of improved crops next year from the system of drainage they purpose adopting, and which has been found to succeed admirably in many places where it has beon adopted. While the oidium on the vines has been less felt in the south than in the north, it has in a great measure disappeared in Italy, without any reference to climate. It is much diminished in Lombardy. A fair quantity of wine will be made in the Romagna, a little in Tuscany, a little in Naples, and an average quantity in Sicily; a half crop may be calculated on In the island of Sardinia and something more in P'iedmont. On the whole, it is reckoned that the crop wil produee perhaps h fifth more than that of last year. The MfonMitore Toscauo announces that the Archduke Charles, the Grand Duke of 'Tuscany's second son, has also been seized with an eruptive fever. The disorder, it appears, is following its regular course, and inspires no apprehension. SPAIN. The Madrid journals of the 19th inst. state, that in expectation of a visit from the Empress of the French, the inhabitants of Arteaga, the place in which Her Majesty's chbteau is situated, had, on the 14th, erected a triumphal arch, bearing the inscription, " Arteaga to the Empress Eugenie, its Protectress," and all the authorities of the neighbouring towns and villages had assembled; but, finding that Her Majesty did not arrive, the authorities partook of a splendid banquet at the house of the French Consul of Gnernica. A letter from Melilla, of the 12th, says that the Moors of the tribe of Benisidel had, after nine months' peace, recommenced hostilities against the place, though at the time several of their body were in the town. The Spaniards generously allowed the latter to leave before returning the fire. The result is notstated. The chief of the tribe had, however, expressed his regret to the Spans Governor that he was not able to restrain his men.
INDIA, CHINA, AND AUSTRALIAN MAILS. (BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAYPE) SOUTHAMPTON, TumisnDA, 10 Ai.u. The Peninsalar and Oriental Company's steame ' Colombo, Captain Fields has just arrived, with the India, China, and Australian mas. She made the Needles at 10 o'clock last night, but was detained for a pilot, and anchored there all nig'nt. The Colombo left Alexandria, .September 12th; Malta, 15th; and Gibraltar, 19th. She has 184 passengers, of whom.u6 are children. Among them are Colonel Lennox, wife, and daughter. The Colonel belonged to the 22d Regiment at Fyzebad, in Oude: only a sergeant of Allery and the Colonel escaped. The passengers include a large number of late residents in India. The Colombo also brings 4,8001. in specie, and cargo of gw1m, silks, shawls, &c. Among the passengers is a lady, who escaped from Delhi with four children and a dog. The fugitives report being all well treated by the merchants at Calcutta, and supplied with money to send them on immediately on the Colombo's arrival. Captain Field received a letter from the Relief Fund Committee, through the Peninsular and Oriental Company, authorizing him to render the passengers every relief and assistance,
A RAcIoG SQUABBLI-The ianmhesr Guardian lays:-" On Saturday a case came before the Doncaster magistrates which excited much interest, In wbich a person named Spraig was summoned for being engaged in a serious disturbance that occurred in the enclosure at Doncaster on Friday, Immediately aiter Blink Bonny had won the Park-hill Stakes. Mr. Superintendent Little, of Newark, stated that he was In the ring after the race for the Park-hill Stakes had been won, and dissatisfaction was expressed at the running ef the winner, who ran the race in two or three seconds less time than the St. Leger was runin, thoglgh oyer precisely the same distance. The owner and jockey were m danger of being imused, and policemen were called to protect them. Great uproar and excitement continuing, it was thought advisable to get Mr. I'Anson away in a cab, but no sooner had they got that gentleman to the end of the enolosure than those in the ring followed, and then the disturbance vas taken up by the ' outsiders.' The defendant was standing on the top of an omnibus, in a conspicaous place. Be shouted, and, holding up his stick, called out as loadaBhe possibly could, 'ill him, kill htm dll the -.' Had those at the outside got hold of Mr. I'Anson he believed they would have kilred him. Mr. Sheardown, the presiding magistrate, asked what was the cause of the uproar. Mr. Fisher (the clerk) aid that he happened to be there, and saw the disturbance. It occurred in this manner-the Park-hill Stakes Were won by Blink Bonny on Friday, carryeg 101b, more than she did in the St. Leger, and running the race in twro second3 less time. The moment the mere came to the ring there was a disturb. ance, owing to the imnpression that the owner and the jockey ' had fleeced the public.' Whether that opinion as right Jr wrong was nother thing. Mr. Sheardown.-Then this iference, whether rghtor wrong, was the cause of the excitement? hr. Fisher said it was TEho magistrate then, having ascertained that no personal violence was usod in the ring, and that the defendant had done nothing more than shou t out, dismissed the summons. Previously, how. ever, Spraig was aaked whether he had so conducted himself. le denied having used the language attributed to him, and stated that he only said, 'Hang the roper,' a remark he in. terpreted as meaning that BUntk Bonny had been pulled In the St.Leger.

FORBIGN IXTELLIGENVCB. AUSTRIA. (FROM oDR owN OOR'RJSPONDET.) tA portloi of the followiag appeared in our wcond e dtlon of yesterday:-1 VIENNA, sBar. 19. Great secrecy is here observed in regard to the proposed interview between the Emperors of Austria and Russia, but iuformation has to-day reached me that they are to meet at the beginning of next month. Some time sincoe the Emperor Alexaider expressed himself to the effect that he should be happy to see his brotlier Sovereign, and there is good reason for beliecing that the Emperor Francis Joseph wiU be at Berlin when the czar passes through that city on his way back to Warsaw. On or about tho 29th inst. the Austrian Monarch wiUl go to see the ex-Emuperor Ferdinand at Prague, and thence to the Prussian capital, where he win remain two or three days. There is no positive evidence that Austria is about to take up another position, but various circumstances induce me to believe that she wiU soon be on much more intimate terms with Russia and Prussia than she is at present. Count Buol's opponents are in very high spirit juBt now, as they fancy he will be obl'ed to quit office if there should be a reconciliation between the Courts of Austria and Russia. As you have repeatedly been informed, the Austrians sincerely hope that the mutiny in India may speedily be quelled; but they begin to talk of the " awkward position" in which England is placed, and to remark that for some time to conso she will be so. much occupied with internal matters that she wiiU be able to pay less attention than usual to the affairs of Europe. In a word, Austria is of opinion that for the moment England can be of little use to her as an ally, and she is, therefore, the more inclined to place herself on a friendly footing with Russia. Some of the foregoing remarks will give little satisfaction either here or in EDgland, but the moment is a very critical one, and it is well that you should know exactly how things stand. The punishment inflicted on Major Count Hunyady has produced a favourable impression, as the public had long fancied that a citizen had no chance of obtaining satisfaction if the person who wronged him wore a uniform. Military men profess to know little or nothing of what took place a HiAtteldorf, but I have acquired some further information on the subject at a reliable source. The regiment of hussars in which Count lunyady was Major marched from Bohemia to the camp at Parendorf, and committed excesses at several ylaees on the road. -A General of cavalry is said to have caled tne corporeal punishment inflicted on the Mayor of HEutteldorf "a bad joke," but it would appear that the Emperor viewed the affair In a much more serious light, for he gave the strictest orders that no favour should be shownto the offender. The sentence passed on Count Eunyady by the courtmartial was four, and not two years' imprisonment. The colonel of the regiment sent Into the Military Central Chancelery of the Emperor a defence of the conduct of his subordinate, and was sent to the provost for four days for his pains. The officers who were present at the manceuvre at Parendorf the day before yesterday relate that a circumstance took Dlace which much amused the Emperor and his suite. A Hanoverian General was addressed by an Austrian General, who expressed his pleasure to see so distinguished a man as aGeneral Halkett-I believe that such is his namin the camp. The Hanoverian was well pleased with the compliment and asked his interlocutor his name. " I am the Emperor" was the reply. Sir HEamilton Seymour is said to have informed Count Buol that the British Government is about to issue a circular note on the subject of the Island of Perim. England denies that the Porte has any claim to the island, and is resolved to maintain possession of it. A Vienna correspondent of the Peslth Lloyd states that it is a matter of indifference to Astria whether Perim remains in the hands of England or not, and the same language has been used to me. According to tables which have been drawn up by order of tha Minister of the Interior the indemnification for loss of villenage and soccage which the* State has to pay to the proprietors in the German provinces of Austria is 307,10O,810fl. The indemnification for the Hungarian, Croatian, Sclavonian, and Transylvaniian landed proprietors is 243,000,000fl. The total sum for which indemnification-bonds has been Issued is 550,000,OOOfl., or 55,000,0001. It is definitively settled that the coin known as a "kreutzer" is en{inyr 4 4 ap - Q-hr. eirelnatihsa The. hundredth part of the currency-union orIm will be called "deute," and silver coins of the value of 25, 15, 10, anid 5 deutes are to be minted. The largest copper coin will be worth two deutess, and the smallest half a deute. A trustworthy person, who saw the reception given to the Pope in more than one of the large towns in the Romagna, assures me that the semofficial accounts of the enthusiasm of the people were totally incorrect. The public either was or appeared to be totally indifferent. " The charges of mal-administration which have been brought against the Papal Government are perfectly well founded, and the country can never be at peace until reforms are made." Such is the language of an extremely intelligent and conservative Austrian. THE MIEETING OF THE EMPERORS. The Nord publishes the following letter from its correspondent at Stuttgart:- * Tho Emperor Napoleon Is to arrlve here on the 25th in the afternoon, the Emperor Alexander having precoded him a little. The Emperor Napoleon is to occupy apartments in the Kiing's palace, as are also Count Waaewski and the other personages of His Majesty's saite. The Emperor Alexander is to lodge in the villa of the Princess Royal, at the gates of the city, on the road to Canstatt, and Prince Gortsehakoft, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Rusda, in the old chateau near the palace. The Emperor Napoleon on the day of his arrival is to dine with the King. The Emperor Alvxander, on the same day, is to dine at the villa of the Princess Royal. The Princess Is aftervards to give a soir-e to a very small party, which the King and the Emperor Napoloon are to attend. It is there that the first interview of the two.Emperors Wll take place. If I am well informed, this interview wil have no other witnesses than the King and the Princess. At the same time Baron do Hugel, Minister of Foreign Afratra of Wurtemberg, will give a soirfr, which will be attended by Count Walewski, Prince Gortschakoff, the principal personages of the Government of Wurtemberg, the membars of the diplomatic body, and the suites of the two Emperors. On the 26th tbe King waill give a grand dinner at the palace, at which the two Emperors, the inembers of the Royal family, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of France and Russia, the suites of their Majesties, the Ministers of Wurtemberg, and the dignitaries of the Court are to be present. Nothing is yet decided as to the departure of the Emperor Napoleon, but it is not thought that it will take placo before the 28th. Notwithstanding all that haa been said, there was never seriously any question of the Empress Eug6uie coming here." TUNIS. We have been favoured with the following extract from a letter dated Tunis, September 12:- " The late decapitation of a Jew in Tunis for the alleged crime of blasphemy, the revolting inhumanity attending the execution, and the fanaticism it aroused, which caused a rising of the Mahomedans against the Jews, has natur.lly given rise to the idea that if such deeds can be perpetrated by the populace, and permitted by the authorlties, there Is no hope of civilization in Tunis; that the property and even the lives of the resident Europeans are in danger ; and that the time is come for Europe to interfere and wrest from the hands of its hinssulman rulers that degraded, though onee fine country, now groaning under a system of oppreaive taxation and tyranny which has brought It to such a state of poverty that it can scarcely provide sustenanee for a sCanty population of 1,500,000, When in ancient times it supported in luxury 20,000,000 of inhabitmats, and at the same time was able to export so much orn to Italy as to obtain for it the title of the ' Granary of Rcme I "Happily it is now shown to the world that these fears and apprehensions were groundless, and that the Prinee who occupies the throne of Tunis, supported by the British and French Governments, and aided by Ministers wLise enough to see their own advantage and that of their country, has at one blow voluntarlly deprived himself of his absolute and despotic power, resigned his prerogative of maiing and re. voldng laws at his own free will and aoeording to the caprice of the moment or the sway of his passions, and granted to his dominionsa constitation, libertyof consdence, and freedom of commerce. " The deoaplt4ton of the Jew mentioned above called the attention of the British and foreign Governments to the state of affairs in Tunis, and indueod them to take some steps, which had been demanded of them by their repective agents, to persuade the Bey to introduee reforms in Wis administration ; and the French fleet lately arrived to lend him moral support, that his Highness might no longer excuse himself upen the plea that any attempt at ameliorations would bring on on insurrection of his fanatical subjels, which ho had not the physioal force to quelL " The BOy, convinced by the earnest representations and persuasivo rguments of the British and French agents, after numerous consultationa with his ministers, determined to make the improvements in his system of governmect wbich were proposed to him, and on tho morning of the 9th of September, having invited the foreign agents and some of the prineipal European residents to wait upon him at his Palae of the Bardo, In their presence he gave a conititution to his oountry, swearing to observe its provisions, and causing his priests, Ministers, and people to do the same. "The eonstitution consists of 11 articles, which would be too long to set out in extenso, and I therefore only give the substance of them, viz.:- " L Security of life and property. " 2. Equal taxation. " 3. Equality before the law of all classes and denomi. nations. " 4 Religions liberty. '5. Limitation of the period of military service. "6. Admission of non-.itssulman assessors in the orimi. nal tribunals. " 7. Establishment of a mixed commerciel tribunal. " 8. Abolition of all immunities and privileges now en. joyed by Messulmans. " 9. Ilberty of commerce, abolition of monopolies, and interdiotion to the Government to trade. " 10, Permission to foreigners to exercise all professions, trades, and cellings, and to introduce foreign enterprise,&c. 411. Right for foreigners to purchase and possess house, landed property, &ac. "The importance of this reform cannot be too highly estimatod. Tripoli was annexed to the dominion of the Sultan to savo it from misery and ruin; France has ocoupied Algeria for the sake of civilization, and Tunis was following fast in the same path; but its ruler has seen the gulf yawn. Ing before him, and, though perhaps not without a pang at departing from the pxth trodden for ages by his ancestors, has quitted the old road and boldly determined to follow without hesitation those guides who have promised to lead him out of theolabyrinth of desolation. " Till now tho commerce between Tunis and Europe has been shackled by monopolies and prohibitions and the impoesibility of private persons competing with the Government in mereantile transactions. These impediments have been removed, and this Regency, which was scaroely known to Europe save as a negt of pirates, will soon be renowned for Its important trade in grain, oil, wool, and many other natural products. Its fertile soil may now be plonghed by the European agrlculturist, its rich mineral treasures be revealed by the European miner, and aU its resources developed by competition with European manufacturers and traders. The natives will no longer dread the loss of their lives and property at the arbitrary wlFl of a tyrAnt, and, being no longer ground down by an oppreosive and rinous taxation, will vie with the Europeans in industry. The Christian and the Jew can now worthip their Maker according to the tenets of their own religions. The conscript wiU feel that a few years wil restore him to the bosom of his family and all will feel that they cannot now be punished without being fatrly judged and their offence proved before tribunals which must follow the preoepts of a written code of laws. "S uch being the importance of the reform, wbat praise can be too great for those who have brought it abont, who have convinced an independent Prince that it is his interest and that of his people that he should cast away his Mussulman prejudices and step from hi.3insulated position into the family of European Sovereigns? Mr. Wood, Her Majestys agent and Consul-General, hias been little more than a year at his present post, buz from tho day of his arrival in Tunfs he commenced his attempts to improve the sodal and political condition of the country. No momentary checks have discouraged him, no foreign policy has been able to restrain him, no foreign interferenco able to outtwit him. The same reforms which have been introdaced of late years into Turkey havo been wrought by him in Tnnis in 12 months. What Lord iedcliffe has done for Turkey and the East Xr. Wood has done for Taunis and the West. Previous to his arrival in the Regency Mr. Wood had acquired for himself an European reputation-first, for his campaign against Ibrahim Pasha in 1840, when he restored Syria to the Sult.n, and then for the reforms he brought about in that country during a resdence of 15 years an Her Msj&fty Consul at Damwasous. He has now won fresh laurel by being the first to take a step to civilize the indepondent provinces of Northern Africa The British Government well knew the neoessity of introducing a more liberal spirit in the Government of Tunis. They were fully awake to the arduousness of the taslc, and they chose the man most fitted by his natural talents and his long residence in 31ussulman countries to cerry it ont. He has done his work, and done it well too. x. Eioches, the French Charg d'Affires in Tunis, has fully co-operated with Ar. Wood in the Lusiness."
11TP PEVI.NSULAR MAILS. The)?ninsular andOriental Company'ssteamahipEnxine, Captain J. Weeks, with the abovenamed mails, in charge of Lieutenanant Cashman, R.N., Admiralty agent, arrived at Southampton yesterday at 12-30 p.m. She left Gibraltar on the 16th inst.; Cadiz, 17th; Lisbon, 19th; Oporto and Vigo, 20th. The Euxine experienced moderate breezes from the north to north-east, with fine weather from Gibraltar to Vigo; and strong breezes from the eastward, with fine weather, the latter part of the a oyage. Gibraltar exchanges on the 12bh inst. were quoted as under:- London, 90 das"' date, 50 15 16 Maleg^, 8 d sht, rar Par, ditto .Sc.Sdtto. ddtto I dis. aeilles, d'iito S. Sic. Aliaunt, ditto Xdls.

HEr Majesty's steamships Vulture and Curlewv were at Gibraltar; also the screw steamship Gibraltar, from London. When the Euxine left Lisbon there were no foreign ships of war in port; the French steamer Eclaireur having gone out on the 17th. The usual PorWguese squadron was lying in the Tagus. The Lisbon exchanges by this packet for three month, are quoted on London 544, with a few transations at 531L - Paris, 528; Amsterdam, 2; Hamburg, 48k; GeLoa, 528, with a very liumited business in continental paper. Stocks had declined a little, and the market was very dull for Three per Cents., registered at 47 to 47A; Coupons, 46i to 47; Deferred, 281 to i; Bank of Portugal Shares, U to 12 percent. premium; and Oporto Bank Shares, 20 to 22 per cent. premium. It had been reported that the yellow fever had broken out at Lisbon, in consequence of the sudden death of several lAbouxers employed at the Custom-house, but the investiga tlon of the Board of Health attributed those deaths to typhus fever, generated by the sudden return of hot weather and the bad odours created in the hide warehouses. B,efore the packet left the panic areated by the deaths referred to had subsided. The King of Portugal had come from Cintra to hold a levee at the Palace of Ajuda on his birth day, the 16th, which was very fuUy attended, and His Majesty was to leave Lisbon again on the 19th for deer'shooting at Mafra. The English steamer Braganzs, from Liverpool, arrived off the Bar of Oporto on the night of the 20th, and was waiting for daylight; bar smooth. Our correspondent at Oporto writes as follows on the 19th inst,:- " The exchange for the packet for biUls at 90 days' date may be averaged nominally at 54S to J, although transactions were done at various exchanges running from 54 to 541, and even'something was done at a-half, There was mote money than paper offering, and money remained over, drawers appring to confine their transactions solely to their actual requirement. "'The vintage is now general throughout the Upp3r D)ouro, and tSo present fine weather has been most propitious for it. Several parties have returned from that district within the last few days, and their accounts of the state of matters are in general favourablo, both as to the quantity of 'wine and the quality of the vintage. It is a diEczlt matter, however, to get at the real truth even from the wine growters themselves, as many of them overrate the nuantity of wrine their 'quintas are likely to produce for the purpose of introdcing other wins grown ont of the lims of te' demarcatlon ' under the pretexct of such being the produoe of their own quinta; there, however, appears to be little doubt that the quantity grown within the 'demarcation ' will exceed the quantity produced lat year by 3,000 pipes, a great deal of which is owing to the application of aulphur. In the Minho provinoe, and in general down in the6Beira, the grapes have all beendestroyed by the disease, with but few exceptions whoer the sulphur has been supplied. " The arope in this countryotherwrise ar abudant; there was asso a very large crop of onions, and the oranges will be so In like manner, shipments of which wil commence early in October, as weU as chestnuts, the trees of which are bendina over with fruit.

" The divers lately arrived here have been doing exellent work by blowing up many of the rocks at the entrance to this harbour, but the stones are allowed to remain where they ae exploded, and if Government don't take measures for ravingthemremovedtheywiul getlmbeddedinsandwhen the river begins to flood, and then matters will be as bhd as ever. One of the ablest hands among the divers, named William Kitto; was accidentally drowned a few days back while on his way at night from the city to St. John's da Foz. His body was picked up this morning in the river Dero, and bas been interred in the British Cemetery." The Euxine exchanged signals on the 20th Inis, at L20 p.m., with the Peninsular aud Oriental Company's steamship Taus, steering for Vlgo; and on the 21st, at 10 p.m., she exchnged night signals with the Ripon, steering southwelt.
RBELAND. I (mBOM OUR 0o' CORR8POWDRT.) DUBLIN, WEDNESDLY MOnaIG . r rar11 AGEICU]1AL DBRESr.$ The Banner of Ul4er contains in its nqmber of yesterday an elaborate and, upon the whole, satisfactor report of the probable yield of the late harvest, togetber with some observations upon the condition and prospects of the Irish agricultural classes The following is an extract:- "1Since the introduction of the tariff under Sir Robert Peel's measure tho masses have been consumers of t¢e bigher class of food to an extent which that far-seeIg statesman never anticipated. If we take the experienoe bf cur own eountry as data it will be found thaz. while the bulk of food raised exceeds by many degrees the highest ever before known, the farmer is in the epjoyment of prices nearly 100 per cent, above the avera e rates current for tho last four years of Protection, and this even while the population of the present day is about two and -half mniLious below that of 1846. The area under potatoes this year is about 1,100,000 acres-say one-fourth above the average of the years from 1836 to 1846; and yet we fiend the value of good table varieties of the potato 3s. 6d. to 4s, per ert., or twice the current rates of the former period. If wre turn to tho grain-market, oats fresh from the flal or the thrashing muachine sell at 9e to Vs. _per cwt., and white wheat 13s. to 13s. 9d per ewt Ilay br' rDore than 100 per oent above its former rates, and dairy produce is at a premium. Butcher?e zeat ranges equally high, and, with the ports open for tle tree iport of continental and other foreign catte, the value o.farm stock is 60 t100 per cent, abore what It was in 1842, wvhen lP.rotctlonits ran about in a state of excitement, aad the cry of ruin rang from the hall of tve landed chief to the home of the tenant cottier. The quality of the food used by the mases of the people in this coont'iy at e present date differs very materially from that whii ormed the chief artcle of eonsumption 15 years ago. In a countrytown not 10 miles distant fromnBelfeet ere are now three grocers and four meal dealers for every one which existed there before the advent of freo trade. The number of master bakers, too, has been largely increased, and the amount of busluess done exoeeds by a high figure the most extensive turnover of former days. . Tho wages of labour havo been considerably increased wit-in the last few rears. Whether we reFer to those who tol at the forge or work in the factory, the carpenter at the bench, or tbe common labourer in the field, al have been asoendingin the scale of socialadvancement ; and their power to pure ise higher and more nutritious descriptior's of food has, o' course, been proportionately increased. Those who we're observant of the condition of the working ranks rnder the rginze of the sliding scale will be able to reineuber that Ireland's poor in l.ose days no ony subsasted almost solely on potatoes, but their food generally consisted of the coarsest qualities then rased. The difference in point of nutritive and even matketable value between the better cultivated and the newer varieties of the potato was considerable, and the poorerranks of the people usually eked out life on the r eapest qualities. Not only, therefore, have the masses of the 'nsh totsUy revolutionized the scale of dietary as regards te exclusivenso of anydescriptionoftheoncefaumfliarroot, but the oonsumption of tea asd sugar, and of course of grain food, has been increased in some districts fourfold. This change must of itself create an extensive demand for corn of all descriptions. Besides the enlarged home consumptidn, the c-oss-Channel trade is at present very aUve. Many of our local merchauts find it difflcult to meet the orders from Liverpool and Glasgow. Irish oats ael at very high ppnces in each of these markets, and Irish wheat is no less anxiously sought after. All these facts tell us that there is stil a wide field of agricultural enterpiise only partially developed in Ireland. It is really melancholy to find that out of a total area exc6eding 20,000,000 acres there should be only about 3,000,000 acres under cereal cosps. The low range of prices for wheat from 1848 to 1853 caueed many farmers to give up the cultivation of that grainand the yield decreased from 3,641,198 barrels of 2i atones each, in 1849, to 1,904,302 barrels in 1I83. Eigh prlces have sice caused a great extension of wheal cultivation, but tho total breadth is still far under what it might e. illions of acres of the finest soil for the growth of grain have yec to be turned by the plough. Capital has of ate years been increasing in the hands of farmers. It will therefore be for the owners of laud to consider the question of better defined systems of tenure, so as to give such security for the return of outlay as will Induce enterprising farmers to bring out in greater strength the natural capabilities of Ireland'm fertile soil."

THE CASE OP DX SALVI. The course that was taken by the legal advisors of this prisoner upon his being brought up to take his trial last week at the Central Criminal Court for the murder of M1r. Robertson in the Queen's Bench prison, appears to have been quite unexpected on the part of the prosecution, and the case, from the facts ind the other peculiar Circumstances connected with it, appeatrs to create a great deal of interest. There can be no difficulty now in stating that the motive for the commission of the desperate act which has plsced the prisoDer In his present position was a feeling of revenge against the deceased in consequence of his having repudiated a debt due to De Salvi, and which it is said involved the whole of his savings during the period ho wIz in serce, amounting to between 5001. and 900. The public is avare that the prisoner, having been acquitted at the August tession of the Central Criminal Court upon that count of the indictment which charged him with felonioudsy wound. ing the deceased with intent to murder him, was convicted upon the minor charge of wounding with intent to do grievous bod ly harm, and thereupon sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude. At the late ses3ion, therefore, uv n the prisoner being arraigned for wtiful murder, at plea of sotdrfOW thzef wras recorded. This plea, being of a ye.v novel character, it may bess well to state isein the foliowiyg terms: The Q sedAntonlodNow Sa o in his own prtper perdon ofneth into sourthele, Oudha jut bcaid thtssOd Bndctment read. saleeo thea our lady the queen ought not fustbes to proee4ut3 against bSmo mnuch of the said Indictmuent as charsed hlms with harSng of hi, malice atorethought murderel the said Rober tf Hederson Robertson, becaume he ssretrh that Istrets iore, to w it, at the general session of tbe delivesy cf tne Qceee'Mg ~ I ootelvtiha°ie Ol BeSl] ,htbo subcrbsol the citr of Londonon Monday the 17th day of August, In the year of our lord, 1857, beforo Sir Samuel Mnstin, Knigbt, one of the barons of our sa1d lady tbe queen of her Oourt of ilsoheqiser, Sir Richard Budden Crowder, Knight, one ot the ju.-itces ot oDxr said lady tbe Queen of her Court Of Common Plem, sud otbers their follows, Justices of our sAid lad) the Quee, assiesed to deSSXr the said gaol of Newrzate of the prisoners therein being be. the said Antonio de Salvi was In due foran of law indicted. arraigned, and tried upon a oertain indictment which chnged him bv the name of AmLiomo de Sals, for that he, en the tlh day of July, In tho year of ouir Lord l857, in the county of Surrey, and within the juriediction of the gsld Court. un. lawfully and feloniously did etab, out, and wound oDe Robert Henderson Robertaon with intent tbereby then and ihere, feloniously. wilfully and of bis malice aforethought, to kill and murder the said abert Iloenderson Robert5on against the form of the statute in sucb case made and provided. And that be. the uaid Antonio do salri, furtber sayeth that upon the triai of the said ininctment be was lawfully acquitted of the Maid offence therein charged an aforesaid. as by the rooord in tbht behalf more aully and as length appears. And he fiurther sayoth that he Is the eame identical eerson as tbe said Antonio de Silii In the Fsid lbt-esentioned indletmest named and not another and different Person, and that the said Robert Henderson KL ,ertson, in the same Indictment ranme4 is the same identicsl person as is Damnd ia the indictment to wich he, the said Antonio de Said, is now here pseafirg. and not another and different pereon; and that the cause of the death and of the aId supposed killing and murdering of the said Robert Henderson Robertson was cerain stabs, c:ta. and woundg, for the inSioting of whdch witb Intent to murder the sa'd Robert Hendergon he. the aid Antoelo de SalviT was so Indicted, tried. and squtsted as aforeseidand not say other stabs. cuts, and oundA, or stab, cut, or wouma whatsoever and not any oCher cause or minisu whatecever. And this he, the sraia Antonio de Balrk is ready to verify.

AD4 of this he putt himself upon the eountry." It is understood that on the part of the Crown a de. murrer will be entered to this plea, the effect of which proceeding is that the facts stated on the plea are admitted, but it will be contended that they do not make out that the prisoner was ever placed in jeopardy upon the charge of wilful murder, and that consequently the plea of audrcfoeS a U; cannot be supported. This will be argued on the first y of the judgestakidg thefr seats at the CentrAl Criminal Court next Semeron, and if the point should be decided agsinst the pr,soner he wil at onoe be tried upon the charge of murder. The general opinion in legal circles is, that the fact of a man itaVing been tried and acquitted of wounding writh intent to ,nurder ts no answfer to a charge of murder where the wounded person afterwarns dies, and It is believed that the only object of the course taken on. behalf of the prisoner is that the jury may have formnally brought before them the fact that the prisoner has been already tried and convicted of an offence arising out of the same transaction and sentenced to a very severe punishment, in the hope that it may oporate upon their minds, and induce them to return a verdict that will not affect the life of the prisoner. CPl= AL OFFENDMS (SCOMsND).-Vo1urninous tables, showing the state of crime in the various districts of sootland in the yea 1856, have just been presented to Parliament by command of Her Majesty. The number of parsons charged with offences in Scotland in 1856 exhibits an increase as compared with 1855 of 83, or 22S63 per cent. The proportion of convictions to comuiittai in 1855 was 75-12 percent,; in 1856 it was 74-873 per cent.; while the proportion of aquittals to comnittals 1in 55 was 24-848 per cent., and in 1856 25G127 per cent. The principal Increase is in the offences against the person and ginst property, while forgery and offences aginst th& currency have very condiderably diminlahed.
INDIAN MUTINIBS. DIfAPORE AND ARRAH. The followlng is a copy of the greater prt of a letter received from a medical officer in er Ma. jesty's 10th at Dinapore -.- "'DINAPORB, AUG. 2. ' Slnce I lad wrote to t he native regimext here have mnutiniod, but withor-t any loss of lPe to us. I told -you all a'ong the rascals would never attack the 10th. We are all so much disgusted here ith the whole affair that really, as an officer of the regiment, I have neither patience nor time to give a fll account of the very bad management of the General and his xtaff in allowing the three regiments to es. cape. They went off in the direction of the Soneo River, which they managed to cross, and afterwards marched to wards Arrah. The day of the mutiny, and a few hours be. fore it broke out, the General commanding gave orders for the removal of the percussion cape from the magazine situated at the top of the native linea This waa done at an early hour of the maorning, and as the artillery cart passed down where the native regiments wexe parading the 7th and 8th gave a shout, and showed evidont symptoms of their desire to stop it; bnt they were prevented, and the cart was bronght safely on to our mew roomn Thesw two regi. mneuts were in open revolt at 6 o'clook a.m. The General was informed of the fxot, and in place of ordering up the guns and the 10th to disarm the7th, 8th, and 40t, on the spot, he only issued the supine order for the native officers to collct the caps that the Sepoys were in possession of, and to report to him by 12 o'clock that this was effected. When the native officers went to carry, or pretended to carry, this contemptible and tomporizing order Into effect, the 7th and 8th rould not give up their caps, but rome of the 40eh complied. The European officers belonging to the regiments afterwards went upto the rebels, and endeavoured to get them to do so, but their efforts were unavailing. The Sepoys told their officers to be off, and fired upon them, but happily without killing or wounding any of them. "The hospital-guard saw all this, and peroeiving the officers running towards the lOth's lines the signal guns were fired off from the hospitaL Tne whole of my patients got on the top of it. They kept up a steady fir*, and maged, Infirm in health as they were, to kill about a dozen of the scoundrels. The regiment turned out, and every one vwas in his place in the course of a few minutes. I gaUoped rond the houses, and got all the ladles, women, and children brought down to the barracks. The order was given 'Gnuns to the front,' and on we went in the fond anticipation o j cutting these three rebel regiments to pieces, Some of the I 37th Qceen's, who arrived here the d.%y before, were trown ' out in skirmishing order. The 10th advanced with their guns, and great was our mortification when we perceived the Sepoys running acroas the country like deer. We fired six guns after them without effect, and here ended this moet | disgracefuly mismanaged affair. One fellow fired a, myself as I was carrying an order, but the bell did not hit me. Some of the men saw where it came from, and found him concealed in one of the huts; I they soon despatched himn. We only killed about 30 of! the mutineers ; had they stopped, and givan the gallant 10th a chancoe, they would have bagged the whole, or at tll events the greater proportion of them; and it Is galUng and muost mortifying to the regiment to think that It has been prevented doing so by the imbeclity of the General, whose cowardly conduct for many weeks past has been the means at least of bringing a heavy affliction upon her Majesty's 10th. 1 must here explain that after the rebols ran off an order was given (two days afterwards) for the head-quarters of the regiment to proceed to Arrah by a steamer to relieve some E uropeans besieged in thst place This order was, however, cancelled, and a smaL detachment of the 10th was seat, under the command of one of our senior captains (Danbar). The strength of the detachment| amounted to 150 men and four officers. There were lso 230 men of the 37th, rnd a proportion of officers, the 'whole force constituting nearly 400 men, Includnlg '.ht or 10 officers of the native regiments from hire, who volunteered. The boat containing the 3Wth got aground, but they were taken on board of the ono which was proceeding up with the 10th men. Th6y all landed safely, and continued their march towards AsTah, the whole being under the command of Captain Dunbar, who made a sad mess of it. He did not, it appears, take the precaution of throwing out an advanoed guard, and when our gallant soldiers were marching on in the full hope o doing good work they wore, about 2 o'clock in the morning. fired upon by 2,000 Sepoys, who were lying in ambush for them. Captain Danbar was killed on the spot, PA wllU nj three officers of the 37th. The men became panlo-strieken, and they retreated in the direction of the steamer, whinh lay two miles out in the stream. Both detachments wore severely handled, and the 10th have lost 70 men killed anA wounded in thLs unfortunate expedition. The 37th sos tained pretty much the same los. The remainder of the ketonhment arrived back here on Friday. All our men are y wounded, anaC orY rnea ,*. t A x _, work amputating and extracting balls.

The medical officer sezt In charge was also wounded, and all the medical stores I sent for the use of the men have been lost. I need not say that the poor ladies and wives of the men are in great distre8s about their husbands. All the ladies are ordered from this to Calcutta. The 10th, now here, are greatly reduced in numbers, and we have at this time only four officers fit for duty; but we expect more troops daUy. The treasure has been removed from here, and we are all in great excitement. If you will refer to my letters written more than two months ago, you will read in them that I then advocated the disarming of these regiments, and frankly stated blhat the General vwould some day regret his misplaced confideace In them. That day has at last arrived, and I prononnce hlm alone responsible for the lives lost and the blood that has been shed. In the whole of 11cr Majestg's army there is not a corps in higher discipline than the 10thb Tho gallant Colonel Franks made them a model regiment. Their movements were as one man, and I will not admit that even the Guards could have gone through their evolutions with tao same, or at least wits more precision and soldierlike bear ing than this regiment to which I have thehonour to belong, and altnough thrce regiments were opposed to us we wer, burning to get at them, notwithstanding we had little more than 400 effective bayonets, for, what wilth the detachment at Benares and the eick in hospital, the above nunmber was all we had here. The disclpline and efficiency of the regiment are well preserved by tho gdbxn officer, Colonel Feusick, now in command, and had it been his lot to take charge of the small expedition sent to Arrah this caSastrophe, I think, weuld not hane happened, because he would have been more cautious. * General Lloyd had been, I am Informed, nearly 50 years ln India, and from bodily infirmity is altogether unfit for suah a command in such troublesome times. Surely it Is high time for any field officer to retire when he require, help to be put on and taken off bis horse.

TH} OVERLAN?D RROUTh FOR TBooPS.-The - vernment have at length made a tardy acknowlegment of the advantages of the overland route for pouring reinforoemnents into India. At present, however, theZ depatoh is to be on a very limitod scale, for driblets of 200 or 300 wn only are to be sent at a time, A gentleman who -has litely been in gypt furnishes us with the following information, relative to this route:-" Owing to the cloud of 4pW ha2iness thrown over the subject of transporting troops to Indh vid the Isthmus of Suez, I find that To lile is known in England as to the real capabilities of wat route. Perhape it may be that our home Government are purposely kept in ignorance as to what might be done hv 4-" -i-- '- order that the otium csm dion of - 1 agents in - '.m uay no; receive zoo ra * eaocT in being suddenly ca=led upon to do something which would intal a Qttle more trouble than the mere forwarding of an occasonal despateh from India. A great deal has been said about the great difficulties of the passage across the Isthmus They lo not exist, e=cept in the brains of those who would wilingly conjure them up in order to insure a contiuuance of their personal ease and comfort at a time when the exigencies of the country demand that the utmost energies of all should be put forth to secure early succour to our hard- ressed countrymen in India. The consent of the VIcero of Egyt and other friendly Powers being secured-and I believe it has never been contended by Lord Palmerston that a sngle diplomatic obstacle retarded the adoption of uoh a plan -the rest of the case Is simply this :-Arrived In the harbour of Alexandria, our troops could be rowedfrom the vessel to the wooden jetty at the mouth of the Mahmoudieh Canal in 10 minutes; or, there ar alwals several light-draught steamers In the harbour which coOd be pressed into the servie. After landing on the jetty, col. lecting baggage, and forming with the striotest mllita precision on the road near the jetty, the troops are within 10 m-inutes' very easy maroh of the railway station. I did it myself very leisurely in that time, carrying a heavily-loaded knapsack, under a blazing sun, on the 10th of August, in this present year of 1857. There is plenty of room on the platf orm of the railway station at Alexandria to muster 2,000 mnen fully accoutred. There is akn excellent railway to Cairo, 130 miles in length, with nine stations, at the follow distances from each other: Between Alexandria and Kaige Dowagh, 17 miles 26 chains (note-80 chains make one mile); between Kaffre Dowagh and Damanhour, 21 miles 27 chains; between Damnanhour and Kaffre Lars, 26 miles 27 chains; between Ksaffre Lals and Kaffr zzAyat, (aoross the Nile), half a mile; between Kaifre Azzayat and Tautah, U1 miles -beween Twatab and Byrket.el-Sabah, 11 mlle3sB0 chains; betw0eni Byrketel-Sbabh and Benah, 13 miles 70 chains; between Benah and KeUoub, 19 miles 40 chlidusbetween Kelioub and Cairo, 8 miles 60 chains. It Is titi' there is only one line of rails, with long sidings at every station, and one or two branch lines; but it is also true that there is only one passenger train a day each way between Alexandria and Cairo; so that the transport of troops would not at all interfere with the regular traffic of the railway. The only stoppage of any consequence is the non-coiapletibn of the bridge at Kaffre Azzayat. There the passenger are transported across the Nile by means of a huge portable steam-bridge, similar to the one in use at Portoanoutb,_ good English-bailt steamers, and large barges. When I last made tbe trip, on the 10th and 12th of Augast resectively, there were from 700 to 800 Arabs-men, women, and children -in the train each way, going to and from the great annual fair at Ta ntah. We were all conveyed across the Nile, bag and baggage, from thetrain n one side of the river to the train on the other, in less than half an hour; but, in aeoordanoe with true Oriental usage, we had to sit in the carriges for another hour before starting. An English regiment, with all its lumber, could scarcely be delayed longer than tbis, The men could take their own proviions with them and hundreds of Arab women and girls will be found at the roadside stations offering water to the thirsty traveller. The regular passenger trains travel at a speed of 27. miles an hour; expresses go 45 miles; but going at the most leisurely pace, our soldiers need niot take longer than seven hours on the road between Alexandria and Cairo. From Cairo the railway already extends neArly 50 miles acrs the Desert to Suez, leaving little more than 25 miles of aotual marching. Though not qtite finished, this portion of the Desert rail way is quite fit for use, and has several times been brought into requisition in eonveying the overland malls and luggage. On arriving at Cairo tlae troops need not leave their carriages, for the lines run into the same station, and having been supplied witb provisions andwater, they would, by going on into the middlo of the Desert at onoe, fhave no occasion to wait for stragglers lost in the mazy streets of Grand Cairo. From Alexandria to the'extremity of 4be railway in the Desert need not occupy more than 10 hours; a night's rest and two days' eay marching would bring the troops to Suez, where they oonld embsrk,.as thousan%13 of other peopl, who are not tr4ined to undergo such fatigues, do embark every year. The labour of marching over the Desert must not be made too mach of. Half a century ago Napoleon's brave columnS and AbercrombWas galant grenadiers marched overand foughthattloe in theEgyptiandeserts; and surely no one, after our. Crlmeau experiences, will be bold enough to say that the British soldier has degenerated during the las. 60 years, I. am not surprised that the Governmeat hesitated to adopt the Isthmiu route until they were certain of having steamers in theRed Sea to Car the troops forwarden theirarrival at Suez; but being now assured of transport at the other end of the route, I certainly am exceeadigly surprisd that our authorities do set seem disposed to msake more extensive-use of It than they at present- appear inclined to do. Why not use beth routes 1 But certainly why not Ue the shortest? Its advantages in point of time ar greater than the public are allowd to kxnow, its disadvanitagee a mere bagated the muh-nualked-of A oiconveniences a perfect sham.

INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMI . Sir,-In 'onsidering the great Indian question, we' ought, as a practical people, to direct our attention'first tothat part which demands an immediate tolution.-'.This clearly Is the reconstruction of the BeDgal army. That army has collapsed, and mu t be reinstated without delay in some form or other. It is no gradual process of progressive improvement which we have now on hand. The time has gone by for that. The Bengal army lies before us in a state of fusion, and must be recast in a nex' mould. It may be some oonsolation for all we have gone through to remember that this opportunity is worth a great deaL The Bengal army had, been fo.raed on the scale required to keep at bay the J4ahrattas, the Nepauleoe, and the Sikhs. We were then one among several Powers struggling for miupeaon4. When this had been secured, we were left 'with a much larger army than was necessary. to hold Indi& in subjection. The revenue was consumed in unproductive military expenditure, leaving suorplus for those works of improvement whi'ch belong to a state of peace. Owing to vYron cause3 the discipline of the Bengal army had become e- laxed to a dangerous degree; and such were the real difficulties of the subject and the strong professional prejudices with which every 'proposed change was met, that an escape from this fale position seemed to be 'indefinitqly postponed. At this point in unexpected strolke came from the hand of the Almighty. The Benogl army has ceas3ed to exist. We have a golden opportunsity of reconstituting that army on a sae, efficient, and economicrl footing, and of gradually revisig the armies of the other Presidencies according to this improved model, with the final resul of converting an annual deficit into anannualsurplus, and of developing the abundant resources of dia by a state of assured peace, improved administration and well executed public workl. The firAt point Is the retribution that ought to be exactd. This is a practia gpestign of the utmost importanoe in its bearing upon all our 'rlans. Human nature itself has to be vindicated; the feeling of the peronal inviolability of thq nlish race in India has to be restored,* aud the rightegus indignation of our nation at the strange and horrible atrocities which have' been perpetrated upon cur women and children hua to be appeased. These are indispensable conditions of xuccems. We cannot resume the efective adsinistration of the NorthWestern Provinces and Oude Wleps we are asured of our personal safety, and are able toxegard the natives with a feeling of kindneis and confidence The relations of govermors and governed; which have been rudely torn asunder, ha-e to be reintegrated; and nothing short of the full application of the potent principle of justice can accomplish thi. But let usbeware how we exct more than justipe. We ought to distrust the present excited state of our feelings, and to consider what is likely to be the view taken by foreign nations and future ages. If we are to bo the governors of India, we mudt also pay some attention to the public opinion of the great body of the,people of India. In the course of 30 yeas' o lowe observation of public affairs, I have repeatedly remarked that 'when a public crime has been. commtted, the firstimpulse in towardsathe adoption of' what are called strong uneasure; but after a year or two a reaction invariably takes place, and the last feeling h one of satisfaction that the extreme measures originkly contemplated were not carried into effect.- As surely as punishment exceeds the necensity of the case, a rebound takes place to the detriment of the judge. . Any general denunciation of claswes of our fellowsubjects as suchh, is esipecialy to be avoided. The disposition at prssent is to put the Mahomedans Under a ban. It .true that, according to its principles a laid down in the Koran, Mahoniedanam is a standing conzpiraoy against every Government -which is not Mahomedan, becauase the sword and the acquisition of temporal powerae the precribedmeans of propagating this religion. But what people act fully up to the principles of their religion? Do the Christians? If they did, Christendom would become the abode of peace and happines, atd the truth of Chrlatianity would be so apparent that the wholp world would soon be- converted to it. Do the Roman Catholics, the high Calvinists, and other Christian ects aet up to their peculist tenets I If they did, we should be -+ 11h +r4.I,.D vwowl of hatrmrs gLnA sth%urdi- ties which the increased intelligence of the age has it may be hoped, effectually 'cheoked. Many milions, of - Mahomedana live as peaceable saubjects under the French and Russian Governments. A much larger number, usually calculated at oneeighth of the entire population of India, are under our rule. So far from the Mahomedans having been conBidered previously to this outbreak as a particalarly dangerous claa, BrigadierGeneral Jacob and Colonel Hodgson, in two of the ablest treatises which have appeared on the subject of the Bengal army, concurred in recommending that they should be employed iu greater proportion than before. "The genel aveae of Mahomedans In a Iitive corps Is probably abot 154, whereas 250 of that nseful and inteljigent class would approach nearer a juster proportion, and as a rule tend to the presrvation of a more politic equilibrium.Y-LeutenanVColonel Hodgson, Meerut, 185L '" The tussulmsan of Eindotoan axe the very best men for our arry. The 'aLtans, &c., ar faithles and treacherous These Hindoatanees are very bold, brave, strong, well made, active msen, fully equal in these respects to the Affghxans (though tbe ldtter be the souter-looldng of the twvo). They are generally most excellent horsemen, and many enlist in our cavalry regiments; but under the presentys>tem no great numbers are found in the infantry corps of the line. "There cnnot be bett Eastern soldiers thn thesm men make when properly treated. They have scarcely more prejudices of religion, &e., than nglishmen- they have mnost liberal idos as compared with those of the Hindoo Sep\oys to vhom they are in every way superior being. With all this they are the most fithful and trustworthy of any men iu Indis; they are. in fact, more like gentlemen thn ny other class of Indians. " With such men in our ranks and a fixed head-quarters for eanh regqment, where thelr famfa oould remaiu in safety and comfort while the corps might be absent on ser. vice, the native troops of thwe Indian army might be emplo;ed on foreign atrvice for any length of time and at any distance from their homes; anld the time may poa;ibly not be far distant vwhen their services may be of the greatest value."-Benarks on thc Native Troopsof the Isui4nArsmy, by Major John Jacob; London, 1854 Provoked by the annexation of the great Ma. homeda;n kingdom of Oude, and encouragedby the disaffection in our native army, Mahomedians have now risen in arms against u; but they have only done so to a certain limited extent, ele it would be difficult for us to hold India; and it has been proved by the examples of the Nawab of Bandw, the Peshawur Guide Corps, Edwards.'s Mahaomodan levies, ani many others, that even at such a time as this Mahomedans are capable of acting faithfully and zealously in our support. But the real point is this-would this Mahomedan ins.urrecton have taken place bat for the previous chronic relaxation and recent active discontent and alarm of our native army, which was chiefly composed of Hindoos? Knowing wbat our position in India Is, ought we not to calculate on a large amount of suppressed hostility, ever ready to burst into actioa on the first favourable opportunity, not only on the part of the Mahomedans but also of other portions of the population; and have we not, by pe rmitting our native army to get into such s rtate, by leaving our forts and magazines. in it.. hancLa, andA by reducing the reserve of European troops much boelowv what it ought to have been, largely contributed to the present unhappy event? We have done positive wrong to our Mahomedan subjects by so sorely tempting thenm; but we shall not make this mistake again. They will receive a check which will cool their fanaticism, and any further attempt at insurrection, under the arrangements which will now be made, will he so obviously liope}ebs, that-they will submit to the decree of Provideince, and resume, with increased diligence, the industrial pursuits in which their superior intelligence so wellqudaifies them to exceL The Mahomedan doctrine is to propagat the faith by the hword; which is quite a different thing from engaging in insensate undertakdngs whiih can only end in loss and disgrace.

A medil of "fidelity" of " British India" might also perhaps be bestowed. We shuild make an exception in this instano from our general policy of never alienating land, and should perpetuate distinguished exampIes by the grant of'hereditary estites. The common native sayaw, tihat the Company's Government "' always takes and never gives" must not receive a new illutration from our conduct on this memorable occasion. This policy of reward and punishment will be easy of application to the cas of individuals, including our own fendatories; but how shall .we pply it to native States? Here a rnore enlarged view has to' be taken, The annexaticn of. Oude was a necessary and righteous act. We were responsible fcr the good government of Oude, bothl by treaty, and by the operation of a military protection from which we could not withdraw; and it had' beien proved by long experience that the profligate unprincipled Nsative Adininistration could not be mde an instrument of good government. But there is another cla of native States the position of which I willillustrate by examples. When Lord William flentinok waa returning to Calcutta from his tour of the Upper Provinces he passed by Jhansee. This was then a well-ordered little State. The Rao was a sensible, high-spirited young man, his aristocracy and army were composed of two or three thousand persons, chiefly of his own family and tribe, and his villages and people had as good an appearance ma any in India. It had been arranged that the title of Maharajah (m%nus rex) was to be conferred upon him. After the ceremony had been performed in the presence of all orders of his people, the Maharajah approached the Governor-General in the attitude of supplication (hata jor) and said he had one more boon to crave,. the concession of which would complete his happiness and make him the devoted servant of the Government (Sirkar) for life. As this was not in the programme, Lord William naturally suspected some interested application for additional territory; but when the Maharajah was asked what more he wasnted, he replied, " To be permitted to adopt the British flag as the flag of my State." This was granted without a moments hesitation, and a union jack was placed in the Maharajah's hands, and was immediately hoisted by his order from the highest tower of his castle under a salute from 100 guns. The meaning of the request was unmistakable. The adoption of the flag of the Supreme Power by a dependent chieftain was the most impressive symbol of attachment and union of interests. After this came the change of policy, the death of the Miaharajab, the annexation, and the massacre. There was another native State, Kerowlee, which had neither been so well governed nor had entered into such an interesting relation with us as Jhansee, but tbe RLajah ivai deicended from the Moon (Chandrabunsee), and loine 'thousands of halfcisili~d xela`tions aMd r6tainers were dependent for their,jociat position nia *uWistence upon the continuance of the little State. He also died without -childre3n, but the Home 'Government interposed, and the' State was not annexed. In all these . troubles the name of. t;erowlee has not been heard. a4d, wbat. is of m4ore consequence, the larger Rajp9ot Sbates of Jeypore, Jodhpore, Biceaneer, &c., 'who8e- chiefs are descended from the Sun * Before the operations which resolted in the suppresion of Thupee commoenoed, a number of Thug leadems discussed in coiuncil wheter they' should exereise theii proession upon 3uropeanse, ad tSey deWded the questiot in the negative for t%h*est ok-lt, that uropeaus gnerally a srna; 2dl*, thae they seldom carried money; an y 3dl, "Iat if the Thugs s.tranled * single European they Woill rover hear the lt of it. .The tir-e~eou was their real mottv4; ind what we now have to do is indelibly to impres the same opinion on tbe whole of India.

The case of their Brother of the Moon was justly regarded by tnom as a test of our intentions towards :them, and they were insome degree reassured by-the result. There can be no doubt that these small national States, which musbt be dependent upon the eeiitrtl Government, and cannot,. if they are treated with common fairness, combine against it, are an impoRt ant element of the Indiaun ystem; and we should take care not to allow the feelings and policy of the present momeut to overbear that more permanent policy upon which the foundations of our I lndian Empire are laid.

FUTURB POLICY OF GOVERNMP2F:T AS REGARDS INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have read with much interest yoiur re marks on the future policy of Governmient s regards the religious institutions of our Eastern empire, afiA, availing myself of your invitation to your teaders to give their attention to this very important subj&% I jot down a few ideas as they occur to me, for you to -use as you see fit. Eaving passed the greater part of the last 25yei\rs in Bengal, and not being a servant of Governinvmt nor a inissionary, I have had opportunitica of 1learning the real oplnifts of many nstivef, which tGovernment officers (civil or military) and mis ,sionsries seldom have, as a native never fQrgets the posdtion of Europeans in whoee company he happens to be, and aots acocrdingly, suiting his opinions to what he believes most agreeable to those present. I have long been of opinion, and I think it mnst nowibe admitted correctly,-that the: extremodelicacy -ofur. iovernmeut in h. matters, not only of Jedi but-of custom-, Aimnot only not beeu appreciate4,,but hasbeen looked upon in some degree a in admislh o bf woakness, and of our depeiience oni th nnitiveaof the country for our suprereacy4 -iinhesittingly-repudiate, as all reasonable . men *must, anythimg like the idea of compulsory conversion of Hindoos orMahomedans, and wouldmot in any.way interfere with their religion; but I raintain that our Government have not only nco inter!fred,,Mbitb4ve given countenance and even encouraoeoliht to customx abho6rent to our own idea f' right wax wrong,;and wrhich form no p;t of what is necessary; either for a good Hindoo or Vif. homedan, . ahd it ix our having done so tbutUs bioigt .us. into,'I pty say, contempt with -the natitee, Who sel1 ktnow our oplnions as Christians, and cannot nderFtandwhy we shoild place theis, ga regads the moral law of England, on what they conider a'bette footing than Englishmen. e . .Why should a Chistian Government, as our does to this day, observe everr religious festival of the natives, making some 30 or 40 of them every year public holydays in altha Government offices in the ame way as Sunday And Christmas Day ? Why.permit- the digmsting exhibitions of the Churruk Poojah, in. whiich no respectable nlative thinks pf baving any concern t Why is, it lawful that sick persons should be openly carried to the side. of the Ganges to die, depriving them in many instancee of a fair chance of recovery even when recovery is desired by the relative; and rendering death certain where, as in. not unfrequently the caio, the recovery of the sick man is the last thing wished for I Why is it lawful for a decrepit old Brahmin to marry an unlimited number of young girl, many of whom he scarcely ever see-before marriage never, and after marriage, in many cases, scarcely ever? For the dreadful conequences of this being lawful I refer all interested to the late discussions on the. law regarding the re-marriage of Hindoo widows ? The Rimdoo religion, no doubt, authories this practice, but it does not enjoin it, and It would be no interference with any man's religion to make bigamy pnishable in India as it is in England. No man who has had any experience of Bengalees can doubt that the present conspiracy was well known, before the rising took Dplce, to the Mahomedans generally throughout the country, and more especially to those greatest of scoundrels, the Omah (servants) of the East India Company's Mofumil (native) Courts; and that, although the work and danger of exterminating the Europeans wa left to the Sepoys, these genUemen were ready to johx a soon as there should be no risk in doing so, taking care not to commit themselves til they saw which side was successfuL Let them, then, feel the power of England, as soon as the work of punishing the mutineers and those who bave dared openly to join them is finished, which will ertaily be within the next six months. Let the moral law of England be the law of India. Let the Government be a 'Christian Government, tolerating all relilons in its subjects, in so far as these religions do )-not obstruct the law, but no further; put down with a high hand all that is contrary to this law, as the suttee and human sscrifice were put down. I have no such fears as those expressed by your correspondent " P," even if we were to act as the Mahomedan conquerors did; nor do I ee any analogy between the mutiny at Vellore, referred to by Colonel Sykes, and the present revolt, either as regards the circumstances under which it took place or our position in India 61 years ago compared with our position after the last of the mutineers Is either dead or banished for life from India-for banishment will, I trust, be the lightest punishment . inflicted upon any one actually in arms against us.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The addresses from young Englishmen which you have permitted to appear in your columns-and no words can express the thanks they owe you for this permissionhave shown how deep is their desire to take some part in the present struggle, and to prove themselves not unworthy of their name. But I observe that those who have written appear for the most part to be such as have a freedom from engagements, which enables them, without great detriment to others, to give their personal services. I write on behalf of those who cannot do so, except arrangements be made to meet their case. I am a clerk, and in the belief that my motives will not be misunderstood, I will candidly own that from my very youth I have worked diligently and in full confidence that where my duty called there should be my energy and my heart. I have not been mistaken, and, for my age, I have been rewarded welL But now, Sir (and I speak for thousands), when manly strength and courage, and determination are wanted, God only knows how burniDg is our desire to show that the same energy of purpose which in peaceful times will help to raise our country to a high place among nations can equally prove its devotion in a terrible day, when our honour, if not at stake, is closely watched. The duties of every large commercial house are carried on by a staff of men of various ages and capabilities, and although in ordinary times all are employed, it cannot be denied that in many instances, and for a period at least, the same duties could be performed by a smaller number. Of those emnloyed some are old, others married or having families dependent on them, others wanting in physio4 strength, while others, again, are of such kind as armies should be made of-young, unfettered, brave, and earnest. While, then, I do pray that you will lot this Apel be seen, I venture to suggest that thosa commerci houses whose liberality is not wanting when money can be of service should, in the event of the appeals for volumteer corps being considered, forego a little convenience, and permit such arrangements among their clerks, that all may devote something towards the great cause ; those less ahle to serve undertaking for the time a larger share of work, while those who are free from ties and fit in person may give that service whioh the country does so need. The Timcs, Sir, has been all-powerful in the commercial world, who owe it much, and we, working in that world, acknowledge the deep debt we are under. Help us now to show that this is not an idle sentiment, but, while recmiting sergeants with false tales strive to delude ignorant herdsmen, and premiums are offered to country gentlemen who through their influence can collect a hundred men, Show the world how you, from the great commercial class, can raise an army of true men-of men who are not the less true in heart nor less earnest in purpose that they have hitherto proved themselves good citizens and clearly und6rstand the cause in which they seek engagement. I for one of many thousands will eagerly offer myself. With willing. ness will forego my earnings during my absence, and, so far as my small savings avail, subscribe to my olitfit and,exr penses-ready. if I should be spared to return, to resume myplace in the more peaceful war of commerce, and thanks. ful for the permision tO take part in that struggle which will be a lasting disgrace if other than Englishm en be permitted to take part in it, Others may urge this more forcibly upon you, Sir, but none can speak more thoroughly from his heart than - Your ok2ient servant. zopt. z2.

The order of the Court made on the 24th of auno ]ast wras that the bal.ance-sheet rhould be filed by the 1st of September, in order that the assgnees might have an opportunity of preparing themselves aither to allow the last examination to pass without further adjournment or to explsin any objections wiclh they had. The two balance-sheets of the five directors were filed on the 12th of this month, aDd the balance-sheet of thethree directors was filed this morning or late last evening. It.' is therefore manifestl impossible, that the last exallnation can pass to-day. The accounts are very voluminous, and the assignees request that this sitting may be adjourned for two months, in order that the official assignee and, his staff may unravel the accounts. The assignees do iiot think it needful to call in any professional aEsistance. Your Honour's order has not been strictly complied with -that order required that certain rests shouldtbe made in the accounts at the periods at which the several directors came into office. At the present moment I am nol; prepared to s-ay that that will be essential. As far as thsi creditors are concerned the balance-sbeets now filed may be sufficient. Theequestion with them is the amount of property and the liabilities. 3ir.

Mr. MAson said he had no objection to the ad'ournment. There had been every desire on the part of his clients to give assistance, but it unfortunately happened that ther had been obliged to fly the countr in consequenee of pro ceedings taken by individual creditors, and hal .a no opportunity of seeing the books or communicating with tneir accountant, Mr. Cooper. They had happily latel'y, by reason of the recent Aot of Parliament, beef s5 Il t- oom. municate with Mr. Cooper, and had tried to get tho balauoesheet upon the file sooner. The CoimssioaaR tben directed -,n adjour.ment to Thursday, the 26th of November next. Mr. LrzNLATxR then said,-It was originallyproposed that a dividend sitting should be zppointed for this day. Whan here on the 24th of June last the assignees thought they migbt make almost a final dividend by this time; we weire then in expectation of the termination of proceedirgs r hi.ch were taken against gentlemen (whore names l vI not mention) for the sum of 16,0001. They, however, d . 3 I ft try the question between the agnees asid there law, and applied to the Court of Cbaoer in action. That was on theeve of the long ve- .nOn , a. -', the defendants giving what wow eq1½ t to judgment in the action, and undertaking to brim -' , court 16,000L, the action was stAyed. That money has ;een p aid into the Court of C iancery, and will unfortunately be locked up tillthe month of November. The question lies in a very narr"wr compass, and by the e nd of Xoveunber It will no doubt be terninated in favour of the agnees. Some delay was also caused with reference to one of Mr. H. Brown's ships, the freight of which we expected to realize on her arrivaL She was, however, attacbed at Hamburg by cre. ditors whose debts Mr. H. Brown ougbt himself to have paid. Proceedings were taken in the Hamburg Courts, and within tho last few days the Court of Appeal has decided in favour of the assignees. Another cause of delay has been the inability of the assignees to dispose of their property at the Welsh mines, although they have made every effort to do so. An item of 126,0001 appeas upon the balnce-sheet for expenditure upon those minee, and intere;t upon the outlay. The assignees now propose themseltes to visit the mines, to see what, if anything, cn be done with thelandlord; tudif any of thecreditors can Mniakeny suges tion to the assignees that will enable them to dis o the property, the assignees will gladly attend to it. But for these delays we should have been in a position to declare almost a final dividend. It has been said that the assignees should give information to the creditors from time to tmre respecting the realization of the estate. It should be borne in mind, however, that assignees have no opportunity of conveying information to the publio or the creditors exeopt upon occasions like the present, when by the kind idulgence of the Court they avail themselves of the opportunity of comnmunicating intelligence respecting the estate. Much has been said relative to the Act of Parliament to which Mr. Mason has referred. The assignees and all interested in the case felt that if some legislative enactment could be obtained giving the asignees, as the representatives of the creditors, power to discharge individual shareholders upon payment of a reasonable amount, or to discharge the whole body of shareholders, by Eome general compromise which should have the assent of an overwhelming majority of creditors, it would be of great advantage to the creditors. The assignees, therefore, took very great pains for the purpose, and succeeded in obWining a measure wbich received the BRoal assent on the 25th of last month. The rights of individual creditors are interfered with by that Act only for the general good, and instead of the shareholders being at tho mercy of individual credltors an opportunity is now afforded them of aiding in a general compromise which wiU satisfy the oreditors generaly. Falling in that, the assiguees have the power to compromietleth any shareholder, but in doing so they wouldhave regard to his means. Now, Sir,the creditorsgenerally arenotinjuredhytbJs Act of Parliament. E,ch has a perfect right to go on against any shareholder, first applying to the Court for leave to proceed, and unless that shareholder gives security to the satisfaction of the Court, and also to the satisfaction of the assignees, as the representatives of the creditor4, to such an amount as may in that particular case be required foi contribution towards payment of all the debts, the cre. ditors' hancds will no longer be tied at alL Very great efforts are being made for the purpose of carrying out the gen;rag compromise. A meeting of the creditors was held at the Freemasons' Tavern (which was very numerously attended) on the 4th of March last. A very large majority of the creditors assented to terms whieh were then suggested. The assignees required payment in the whole of 16s. 6d. in the pound. There will, we trust, be 109s in the pound under the bankruptcy, nd a further contribution from the share. bolders of 6s. 6d. inthe pound. Shortly after that meetng the dissolution of Parliament took place, and it did not assemble till May. Not one word of objection was raised in either House by any creditor of the Royal British Bank, or any one in connexion with it, to the passing of the Act ofParliament It did unfortunately happen that the Tipperary Bank case had excited some opposition on a former occasion, and the Bill was delayed until the termination of an appeal in that case then pending in the House of Lords. The Bill did not receive the Royal assent before the 25th of August. A meeting of many of the solicitors interested for influential shareholders had been previously called. I attended that meeting as rcrresenting the assignees, as did also the official manager, who Is assisting to carry out this oompromise. A circular was issued, announcing to the shareholders abroad that the Bill was expected shortly to become law, and inviting them to return to this country for the purpose of contributing to the common fund. Many have since returned, and there can be no question that their safety depends upon their willingness to contribute so as to put a stop to further proceedings. The solictors who represent the sharenolders are exerting themselves, and are most anxious to bring about that result. Should a general compromise not tke place the onportunity will be afforded to the assignees (rihich undoubtedly they will exercise) of compromising with individual shareholders, and the others will be liable to the attacks of creditors. I have felt it due to the assignees to make these observations, because some isconception has arLen as to the course the aseignees have pursued. The assignees, who aro themselves large creditors, can have but one interest in common with those who have appointed them. They have desired to get wbat they can from the shareholders, and the question is, which is the best course to adopt t There has been subscribed a fund of 10,0001. by the shareholders as a guarantee fund. That fund will be forfeited to the creditors if the compromise should not be carried out, and unless within the next month that object shal be effected the asignees wiU give no further time, but will proceed to deal with individual share. holders, leaving those who will not contribute exposed to the proceedings of creditors. It will be rather out of place to r^ake any observationswithreference to theprosecutions, but r,ne wordon that subject in consequence of the misconoeption that ppeas to have arisen It seems to have been supposed that the cx officio informations filed by theAttorney.GeneraIl embraced almost all those matters of complaint to whieh your Honour's judgment referred. That, however, is not so. At present there has been no information with reference to the circumstances under which the original charter was obtained, nor to the misrepresentations to the Board of Trade for the purpose of obtaining the supplemental charter The question raised is that in which the public are more materially interested-viz., whether or not the directors did conspireto defraud the shareholders and creditors and the publiabyfalseancountsanid representations knowrn to be untrue, That is the simple question which will have to be tried in the month of December if the labour neoeosry in getting up the cases can be got through by that time. Mr. GiUott, one of the directors, said-I think it is those eight directors who signed the certificates to the Board of Trade who ought to be punished. They represented that they had got 100,000l. capital paid up, and I and manyround me feel that if the cbarter had not been falsely obtained this bank would never have existed. Mir. LAwRAV1CE said,-The right of individual creditors to proceed for the recovery of their debts must be somewhat controlled by the statute, and each application against a shareholder would depend on its own peu'liar circumstances. No such Bill could have been pasmed but for the aid of the aignees, and great benefit is likely to result from it, while At te sa time a great scandal will have been removed from the profession to which my friend and I belong. Pro. ceedings have been taken which bave resulted in rain to many sbareholders, and the solvent shareholders have been compelled to leave the country. A general coDnpromise, to be sanctioned by the assignees and by the Court, would be most advantageous as well for the shareholders as the ereditors and, if carried out, the M6s. 6d. in the pound would be paid ; but there can be no question that the proceedings by mdividual creditors have very seziously prejudiced that oom[romise. No time should belost on the part of shareholders in F determining at once whether shat compromise shoculd be car ried out. In justios to the assignees, in 5justice to the creditors and thoses hareholders who are willing to eontzi. huts to the extent of their meanY, I am bound to state that, whatever may be the result either of compromise or the appliciation for individual discharge of the shareholder, that our beat thanks a*e due to the-&-signees forthe-pans tbey have taken. It was obvious In the ery first iastance that in a remedlal meune of this kind no effort on the part of the shareholders eouldbe sucoeofil unlssu spported by the ahigpces. The Bill ws famed and carried with the joipt abistanee of my friends, Wi. Linklater and Mr. Field, who undertook the inaagewent of the details elsewhere, and tbe result Is to plawe the shareholdes in a ponition of ismporar and eqmp rave itfl; but it would be a roost ungrttdul zeturn if -the shaold tra do Dot take adrantoge of %he etpozhunity afforded tbmu, and contnbqe for the generaloompromise. lbuy I :represent who bai-e tarne in onequence of this ct hamg passed wil use their bekt exertions to carry It out. Mha amount ig very lsig;, 170,CO01, but I do believe that if shareholdera knew tho vital importance to themselves in earring out this ooz. promise the amount might be mnbsczired. My friend has aluded to the conduct of the assignees. I can only say that they have -wel and zealouly dischaged their duties. The proceedings which have been reterred to have been taken independently of this Court. Mr. LNKLATXE-With reference to the lability of the newahareholders,Imay observe that-before the asignees pro. ceeded with the examnintion of ie'directors, orinade public the circumstances connected-with the failure of the Royal British Bank, they had the eccuent of alnost all the now shareholderr, abndoning any cam against the estate. The queston of the liability of thonew sareholders to the creditors has been solemnl .defded by the Court of Oueen's Bench, Exchequer, ind Common Plea, and there can be no question that they are liable to the creditors of the ba slthough, as between' thernsslvea and the old shareholders they may not be Liable 'o ontSibute on tbheground of fraud; even that question is appealnr the Court of Chanoeer Tlhe COUTO}W~-I an, In peat hopee that tat Act - oh Parlia m ent will be m atind ile ne fldWf m easue e, and th at a . generl comomlsemi~eeffeced, to a tdfinally wind up.- W s sr thisnostnaorhntusiebak

MIDDlE8XSXSSIoNS, Wed-day, Sopt. 2 (BeforcaMr. BODO1r, at ClrkeniAe.) Carlos Lopez, 20, a Spanish sdlor, was indicted for fraudulently obtainig by false pretences the sum of 4s., with intent to defrad Bicard Schofield; there was another chaLrge ina thxe indiUctment. Mr. Way prosecuted. The prosecutor ws a tobaooonis, carrying on business in Fore-street, IUmehouse, and the prisoner represented to him that he belonged to the 9hip Champion, producing a pr to verify his statement, and to show that he was entiteedr pay to the amount of nearly 401. Upon the faith oi what he a the prosecutor gave him A dinner off steak and advanced hm 4. on account. He went away, and did notreturn. Subsequently he was taken into custody on another change. I was untrae that he had belonged t- the Champion. ie second cae was this:-In March, 1856, he went to the house of Mr. Miller, 21, DevonshIre-streetk Commercalroad, and represented that he was In greatdistress iut then, but was entitled to over 30S. for wages from the ship Eliza, which he ws to reoeive at the America Consulate. He asked M Miller for a loan of 4a, as he said, to procure clothes, so that he rmight appear before the consul in decent attire. Believing what he stated to be true she lent him the 4., and gave him breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper, after which he decamped, and not ing more was seen of him. He had been in prison since he committed the frud. The pretence was negatived. The evidence was interpreted to the prisoner in Spanish by Uolce-constable 133 EI, a very intelligent manm Mzr. BODn asked Mrs. Miler what langnsge the prisoner spoke to her in when he obtained the money f Mrs. MiUer said, he spoke English quite welL Prisoner.--No I did not. I don't understand it. (LAughter.) Mr. BODKnS then sunmmed up, and The Jury found the prisoner GuWiy, and three former convictions were proved against him. Mr. BODXn sentenced him to three years' penal servitude. The prisoner, with a diabolical grin, muttered something In Spanish to the interpreter. Interpreter.-He says, my lord, in Spanish, that when he comes out of prison he will run the last witness (Mrs. Mhiler) through the body, if he gets 20 years for it. The prisoner said, " Look here," and he very significantly drew his hand across his throat. He was then removed. The prison officer said, the prisoner twice attempted to use the knife during his former Imprisonments. George Hurst, John Murphy, and Benjamin Davenport, three hawkers, were indicted for stealing a gilt timepiece, and oter aicles, value 5L. and upwards, the property of George William Tjler, in his dwelhnghouse. Mr. Digby appeared for the prosecuton; Mr. Ribton wAs lnstructed on behalf of Hurst. The prisoners pursued a system of robbery In the suburbs in this manner. One of them would go to the door of a residence, and offer some trifling articles for sale, while the others were reconnoitring and devising rmeans to rob the house. The prosecutor, in this case, lived at Finchleycommon, and Burst offered firestove shavings for sale at his house, and while he was doing so the other prisoners were standimg at the gate. Soon after they were gone it was dls. covered that some one had got through the front parlour window, and had stolen several articles from the mantel. piece. Information was at once given to the policeman on auty, who went in quest of the prlsoners, whom he had seen loitering about Cney-hatch-lane, and they were found attempting to conceal the stolen articles. Mr. RIBTON said, he could not dispute the evidence, and declined to address the jury. The prisoners were found Guilwy. It was stated that they were known to the police as the associates of ihieves Mr, BODna sentenced each of them to six months' hard labour. Stephen French, 27, shoemaker, was indicted for unlaw. fully and maliciously inflieting grievour bodily harm upon Elizabeth the wife of John Turner. Mr. Langford appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Dlbton for the prsoner. The hrusand of the prosecutrLx, a horsekeeper, in the employment of a cab proprietor, lived in Brook's-gardens, Bagnigge-wells-road, and a brother of the prisoner lodged in the same housr. A quarrel had taken place between the husbaund and the brother, which the prisoner took up, and on the 23d of Jane he went to Brook's-gardens for the purpose of encountering Turner. He was met Mrs. Turner, who knew of the quariel, and she asked hi f if he was waitingforher or her husband? Hereplied that he did not wanther but her -husband who had quarrelled with hils brother, and immediately struck her several blows on the face and kicked her on the right leg, which was broken tbereby, and she fell. Assistance was procured, and the peor woman was removed to the hospital, wbere she reosianed two months, and she was now so lame that she had to be assted into court upon crutches. While the ase was prooeedinu an offer was made on the part of the prisOPrr to pay 101. to Mrs. Turner in 20 weekly instalments, bat herbhusband sid tbe prisoner was not in a pcsitlon to pay anythizg of the kind, and even if he was he would not ac.ept an compromise at all, but leave the case to be dealt with bv the Court. Mr. kuT=ON, in addressing the jury, urged that the broken legrwasthe result of accident, aid hot of any deliberate act er- intention of the prisoner, and that althongh the pri3o*er lad rndoubtedly committed an aault it was not one of the s2rious nature desribed in the first count of the indict. j uent. He hoped, therefore, that the jury would convict upon ibe minor count only. Tbe,iu7 found thq pdroner Guilty upon the:eoacad Mr. SsroN xud, the prisoner had been fn hcstodjtbree months already, and was reAlly borry that the poor woman had had herleg broken. It wasnot done intentioUally. Mr. BODE3 sentenoed the pilsoner to an additional fmprisonment of four months with hatd labour, and said, it wa, most creditable on the pert of the husband, conidering kis condition of life, that be had rejected the offer of pequniury compromise which the prisoner had made. John Barren, a smartly dresed young man, was indided ftorstealing rawah, the property of W. Bindley, in his dw ellnghouae.

Upon refet. ring to the bills given to the cuntomerx there appeared to have been some Irreularity, for, instead of adopting tbe prineiple of the maifld writer, by placing a sheet of prepared black paper between, so as to produeo a doplioste of tle bills for his emploloe, in those cases in which he d d not pay over the money ne reoelved he wrta the reoeipt on the original in ink over a receipt stamp, which of coure d d notappea on the duplicate copy.

'1 Recruiting for the corpa of Royal Marine Li,',t Infantry is actively proceeding, the Lord% of the admiralty having decided on keeping each division u- to its fuU strength. A recruiting party, under the c'mand of Major E. Marriott, has proceeded from head- quarters, Chatham, to Leeds, and yesterday another ',arty, commanded by Captain J. Huskismon, left for W'jrcester for the purpose of raising men. The depots of the I3d Welsh Fusileers, 24th, 27th Enniskillens, 29th, 5od, and 84th Regiments have been considerably augmented by the arrival at Cbhtham yes. terday and the day previous of upwards of 100 recruits, for the purpose of joining those regiments. In consequence of the large number of recruits who are daily arriving at' Chatham, amounting to upwards of 200 weekly, for the purpose of joining the Indian depbts at the Provisional Battalion, considerable activity prevails at Chatham barracks in preparing the men for embareation for India, for the purpose of joining the service companies of their respective regiments. The troops are marched out daily to tho lines, where they are exercised for several hours, in addition t-o which large bodies of troops, selected from the various depots, are instructed in theuse of the Enfield rifle, no non-commissioned officer or private being allowed to embark until he has undergone a oourse of in. straction in that -weapon. Nineteen officers and 300 men of tho 78th Regiment arrived at Portsmouth yesterday afternoon from the camp at Shorncltffe, to embark in the steamer Ireland for India. The newly-formed second battalion of the 2d Queen's Royals, which left Colchester Camp last week for Shornciffe, consisted of 16 officers, six sergeants, 300 rank and file (all xecruits), 10 woomen, and 14 children. The recruiting for this battalion, and for the depotb of the Rifle Brigade, continues as actively as ever, and, as a proof of the readiness to enter the army, we may mention 'hat about 500 recrmits lave joined the Colohester Camp within a short period, and fresh men are arrlving every day from the various provincial towns where recruiting parties are stationed. On Saturday the 1st depOt battalion, consisting of the 4th, 12th, and 89th depOts, left the camp for Shornchffe, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Whitmore. The battalion consisted of 31 officers, 400 men, 87 women, and 165 children, and their departure will leave the camp entirely in possession of dep6ts of the Indian regiments, which will be comprised in two divisions, as follows:-2d and 3d battaLons Rifle Brigade, Sith, and 56th, 1st and 3d battalions of the 60th Rifles, under the command of Colonel DLcon; 1st Royals, 34th, 37th, 3Sth, 8Sth, and 97th, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Street. Accounting for the departure and arrival of dep6ts, there remain in camp about 2, 100 men, who upon the whole may be said to be healthy, as there is but a small proportion of invalids in hospitaL One death took place last week. that of Colour-Sergeant Wedgeworth, of the 97th, a remarkably fine man, who passed through the Crimean campaign, and was awarded the Legion of Honour for his gallant conduct in the attack on the Rodan.

The following figures will show the state of the Third Royal WVestminster Middlesex Militia at the present date:500 men have received their training bounty of 1I. ls.; 312 men have been enrolled this year; 11 men re-attested, whose term of five years' service has expired, making a total of 823; and volunteers are stiU coming forward daily for the remainder of their bounty.

OLD SOLDIEIRS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-There is no rule without its exception--a truth which seems to be lost sight of in the indisoriminating onslaught on old officers made in your leader of the 19th iDst. You bid us bowaro of old men in our Meeruts, and Din.a pores, and Allahabads. As a brother of the proved veteran now in command .t M , PArmnit mo to mention a feo particulars of service already done, which may be taken as a pledge of his further capability. At the battle of Aliwal the dashing manner in which he led on his battalion of Goorkas drew forth the highest encomium from his commanding officer-the gallant Sir Harry Smith, who, alluding in his despatoh to this circumstance, adds (so far as I can recollect the very words) this strong expression, " When this officer gets his brigade I feel sure of its being second to none." Sir Harry was not mistakea in his man, this augvry being signally verified both at Sobraon and Guzerat; the object of the above commendation for his good ser. vice in both of those engagements receiving the deco. ration of C.B., and the appointment of aide-de-camp to Her Majesty. Admitting many old officers to be used up, there Btill remain many others who, though past the pbysical strength of middle age, have their mental vigour unimpaired and their martial fire unquenohed, and who, taken for all in all, can hardly be accounted the worse for wear. would the country have been a gainer by shelving on account of the age which they had attained at the time of some of their most brilliant achievements such men as Sir Harry Smith, Napier, Gough, and others of the same stamp? Havelock himself, remember, is no chicken. Tenderness for the reputation of a soldier brother, who now, at the call of duty, is placed in a situation of peril, must be my excuse for troubllng you with these remarks, I am, Sir, your obedient servant bep. zz. - I *:--ov-u Is uaru.
VOL UiVTEERS FOR INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF TIHE TIMES. Sir,-Wbile reading your impression of to-day I find eight letters, headed " Volunteers for India," and signed respectively, " Young Englishman," " Young Scotsman," &a., the purport of all those being, that Government ought to form a corps of young men, (trill them for a month, and then despateb them at once for India. Now, this r;ay read all very well on paper, and they certainly deserve a good deal of credit for volunteering their services, but I do not think they have any cause to grunmble at the Horse Guards and Hon. Board of Directors civilly declining their services when we consider the number of officers in Her Majesty's service that app]y daily to bo sent to India to fight the battles of their eountry and are refused. I do not wish to detract from their merits in the slightest degree, but I certainly think they have no right whatever to feel themselves It is very ridiculous to imagine that Government would send outa regiment to India of a month old, although it were composed of " Youeg Englisimen," when there are at present six regiments of the Line serving in North America, three in Nova Sootia-viz., the 6id, 63d, and 76th,-as also three in Canadar-viz., the 9th, 17th, and 39th (not including the Canadian Iifes and Newfoundland Companies) -making a total of eight regiments in North America, which, in timea lke these, when India is fast falling from our hands, are not needed; sturely it would be better to send trained soldiers like these to India, men who were all whre " ou gh the oCrtmean campai gn , andU can endure hardship andfatgu, tan o enda rgientofa month old, with- oi t an y oih d trg nization, and notur kno w g a ytbing about m l t r d utain e s fom u r der it n a hm ist dke dto lth k tha t n y m a n , oweer clever wihe m ay be,icant bhe lade year soldier ia a If Government would form a corpw of "iIYounrg English. men," and, after they were wol driued let them do the duty of soldiers of the Line, and senod t experienced menr to India, then I think those " Young Englishmen" would be serving their country with as much ardour as if they were "Ito go forth sword in hand, full Of vigouir, and burning with determination, and return not til vengeance had been obtained by miurder an hundredfold."

UTJSRBOrBCTBD FBMALBS IN YORWAX*., Some future novelist of the historic school will1 have a warrant for cornrienojtg his story in this I 'Way :-" On a fine ev-; -- toiwards the close of the AU,lmer of 185O v braWo. - - tag their Way througit the great Norwegian forest 1i thel recticn of Kongsberg. Both belonged to the fairer half of creation, and both were mounted but the younger of the two, whose locks escapel luxuriantly from the widest of wideawakes, testrode her pony with the assistance of articles which our arch.eologists a3sign exclusively to the gentlem-nen of that period." In truth, as the song says, " A light heart and a thin pair of breeches will go through the wvorld, my brave boys ;" but w e were not quite prepared for such a literal proof of his assertion as this record of a brave young lady' performances in Scandinavia. As to the ap parel in this case there is no more question than as to the decided pluck and cheerfulness of the wearer, for the graceful outline of the appendages is not only indicated in a woodcut on page 221, but we are informed that they were made of scarlet flannel, because " red looka pretty among the trees, charms the peasants, and frightens the wolves." In the forests of Norway they had " the most beautiful effect," not to speak of their usefulness, their ease, and independence, which permitted the wearer to have a foot In each stirrup, " while mamma sat twisted sideways on a saddle which would not keep its balance." The costume and attitude, moreover, excited the warmestadmiration of the guide, who "was undertheirapression that they were the last English fashion," and " a stray cigar or tho given him completed the illusion," whether from the case of mamma or the fair rider a la Zouave is not communicated, but we trnst they were not "full flavoured," or of Regalian dimensions. As to the other accessories, the " hobnail shoes," the " driving whip," and " fishing rod," and the vow " never to set foot in Norway again voithot a gun," we can more easily assent, for they are within the limits of a fair recoil from metropolitan vanities, when to a heaIthy and high-spirited organism at the end of the London season Mayfair and La Donna e mobile are a wearinees of the flesh. That two such travellers should cross the desolate S6gne-Fjeld and penetrate where no ladies and, indeed, few gentlemen have ever preceded them is a fair ground for boastfulness. But the chief ground for commending their bold undertal]ug is the light, pleasant, and ladylike spirit in' were encountered, and are here d Tapley treatment of the asperiti ti es. ; is admirable in man or woman, bu-WhEL' to this maybe added a keen appreciation of the good qualities of the Indigenes, an inquisitive sympathy with their ways and notions, and an accommodating end considerate spirit towards them, the couleur de rose narrative is as charming to the readers as the scarlet inexpressibles to the admiring guide. The writer was not one of those who hid her drawings when the population crowded round her eager to inspect them. On the contrary, she passed them round, for "if apicture only shed a ray of satisfaction on the mind of a workman and linked one human being closer to another" it was her conviction that she "accomplished a moral purpose which ought to reward the artist, be he a man of ever so much taste and refinement." In the same spirit she humoured the fancies of her peasant hosts to dress her up in their own costume, appears to have answered all their questions even to the invariable "How old are you ?" to have troubled them as little as possible, cooked and managed for herself and mamma, "U Undinized" in the neighbouring fountain, dug potatoes if need were, and even caught her goose, as suggested by a psant host, as an appropriate exercise and pre- iiuary to her din,ner. It is not uncommon to see a cheerful spirit of this kind combined with a clear perception of what a tourist can observe and illustrate, and accordingly she has no recourse to gazettears and guide-books, while she gives us many a pleasing picture of Norweg,ian life and manners. But to describe scenery in the manner of the authoress, so as to give its general characteristics lightly and clearly, without pedantry and confusion, iS a much more artistic and uncommon accomplishment. How often have we oeen Dewidcere4L by the quantity of details which are not translateable to the reader's eye, however definitely they are discerned by the traveller at the place described ! The notions we get of the outlines of some intricate landscape, or of its local coloar, where the unimaginable hues of the polyflossodendrons intermingle with minute varieties of the colybobula princeps is sadly disproportioned to the efforts of the writers, who, mistaking their department of art, attempt to render these particulars. Tn fact, it is more easy to work a miniature portrait in Berlin wool than to convey throngh the ear impressions which the eye alone is capable of receiving. Now, we have none of this nonsense, we are happy to remark, in this instance. The authoress keeps her technicalities for her drawingboard, and in making her light transcripts in pen and ink she attempts no more than the vehicle permits and provides for. The horror of the pass, the roar of the waterfall, the rustling of the forest, and the air of the mountain are sufficiently suggisted, and there she stops; while the pictures of Norwegian courtesy and goodwill are touched in as lightly as the effects of her colourbox. Here iS a specimen of her manner: "We3gt on splendidly. The pony ran briskly along the Golden Caley, uphiUl and downhill at equal pace, requiring no whip; the red-capped boy gaily waved the reins over our heads. The springs of the carriage were easy; the road, though undulating, of smoo,h quality; and altogether those ten miles seonned wonderfully short, when we ap. proached wbat the Norwegians call a ' station,' or spot for changing horses. I had fancied it to be a place resembling a busy Inn-yard; and having heard a great deal about the postmasters, thought they wero persons in offloial uniform, always on the watel for travellers, and who spoke a lan. guge or two minstead of which soime solitary farm buildngs,tenanted by two women, who did nothing but stare, d not promise much chance of expeditious forwarding. As this was a ' fast' station (one where horses should be in readiness) I must confess to having been rather cross at the aspect of tbings. which I much regretted afterwards, and hope no Englih will be so in future, for when the women were fairly stirred up they ran off for the post. master, a rough peasant at work in the fields, and he instantly fitted ouit two first-rate carrioles, the women keep. ing up our spirits with brandiviin and cream; and when two honest farmers cheerfuUy left their ploughingto aceom. pany us, we felt that deep confidenco in the people esta. blibed which never for a moment forsook us during the whole of our journey, and which would have made us follow a Norwegian guide round the world had he said he knew the way." "We were doomed again to he benighted ; the perpendiculer rocks advanced so closely, only leaving room for a narrow stream, that they completely darkened thevale, and shut out the small glimmering of light which remained in the sky. 1'he road was horrid, more like heaps of paving. stones thrown one upon another; and we expected momentarily to be jerked into the stream at one of the angular turns, whon the gaide proposed leaving the car, putting the things across the horse, and continuing on foot-a comfortless prospect; five miles of such walking, with a toaring cataract beneath ! The wind had begun to howl-a wolf rushed past-and in a deplorably nervous state, not knowing how many more there might be about, we groped on in the dark, tiU alight, which scemed pletced at Use world's end cheered us with hope; on reaching a plank whiHi crossed near a watermUl sonne friendly hand was extended, and we were led into a hall, where the open countenances of the peasants seated round a table drove the wolf's Image away on the spot. Whatover surprise they may have felt at seeing ladies alone in such a spot, they expressed none ; their whole endeavour was to make us comfortable. Setting the water to boil on the blazing pinewood fire, they produced the Norske brandiviin, and with sugar concocted a lmixture which even surpassed that lnsurpassable tbing, Scotch toddy,-shaking their beads, however, at any men. tion of the S6gne-fjeld expedition in prospect. The priest at Lomb had given us a letter to a farmer, who he said would take us across in safety, if any one could; and, sending for him overnight, we ordered himself, son, and two horses to be in readiness next morning at six. He made no hesitation at leaving his home and o-cupations to set off on such an expedition, though very much astonished at the sum. mons. "INext morning I did not feel quite so ready to rise at daybreak, and was lying half-awake, drowsily musing upon the patriarchal style of everythiDg at Hoft, and trans1ozting the scene to the days of Ruth at least,when a dim vision of fur caps, silver buttons, white legs, rose before me, mingled with subdued whispers, and the words, ' English, fairy, no ! take care, hush !- At length a hand was stretched forth to touch a lock of my streaming hair-the spell was broken -and opening my eyes wide I saw a crowd creep stealthily away, looking at me till the last moment, when they closed the door softly as on a sleeping babe-and all was stiL. These were the peasants who had got up early tohave a look at the wonders, English ladies, and whom they would not stare at the evening before while they were in a state of consciousness." If we could quarrel with the performances of such a sprightly narrator, it would be on behalf of that sex to which, among others, the tribe of reviewera are pi-esumed to belong. We are unable to call them the abler sex after the authoress has "1 found - UnprOteded 1emales ir, Z2V)2iay- or, the Pleasantesl Weay of Travellinq there, poming £hrio,lah Denrkuvr- and .~2veden, 'ri!h Scandi,riiqn lS/:WtchEs froin Naeture.

"It ia astonishing, if ladielj look perfectly helpless and innocent, h6w people faUl into the trap and exert themselves to serve them ;" and this credulity procures them priority at post etations, instant attention, and the best accommodation everywhere, half-price charges, and the less amiable ptivilege of laughing at those who are less fortunate than themselves. We think it, however, an unfair climax that ladies who enjoy such advantages should cut jokes at the expense of the feebler sex, who are forbidden to share them because they wear coats in addition to their pantaIcons; and if the authoress had taken a more generous view of the disabilities which, under such circumstances, attach to beards and mustachios, wo should have made her a lower bow on parting from her company. As it is, we have to remark that her kind interest in the native peasantry is qualified by a tendency, still lers uncommon, to keep one's countrymen at arm's length as natural enemies, and to triumph at the mishaps and discomforts they en counter. We have also to notice her suspicion13 and ambiguous assertion that a wife should be a companion, not a head servant, for we should hardly be disposed toaseent to this if it is meant to impugn the ordinary domestic relations. Young ladies wfho insist on their own superiority to our feeble, fussy, and irritable sex may claim more privileges in consequence than we might be willing to concede as the domeatic price of their countenance or compassionl. Tf the authoress has any "atrong-minlded" bias in this direction, wve would, therefore, recommend lher to discard it in this country with the scarlet inexpressibles, or she may remain "unprotected" to the end of her pilgrimage.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TLIMES. Sir,-Your correspondent Mr. Higgins justly observes that the most important view of the purchase question is the manner in wbich the fature composition of the army will be affected by the decision. Two classes of persons are excluded from the >x>-by the existing necessity of investing large rm-sn of money in purchasing promotion-that is, L. Young men whose parents have been able to. give them a liberal education, hut cannot provide them with a fortune in addition; and, 2. Young men belonging to the great middle class which occupies the large space in English sOCiety between the old-established gentry and clergy and the labourers and artisans. The first of these two classes is the main support of every E"nglish liberal profession eaxept the army. For one young man of fortune who does well at the Universities, and in the professions which are fed from the Universities, at least a dozen rise to distinction whose patrimony consists in carefully cultivated minds and energies braced to achieve success. It is well known that nothing so much diminishes the chance which a young lawyer has of becoming Lord Chancellor as the possession of 5,0001. Of the other it is not too much to say that, if one class has contributed more than others to make England what we now behold her, it is that which intervenes between the old landed gentry and the workpeople. The mercantile marine, the manufactures, the railroads, the industrial'system generally of the united kingdom are the result of the enterprise, the skill, the perseverance, the admirable practical qualities of this class. There was a time when this portion of our English cornmunity was as renowned in arms as it afterwards became in arts. lhe military reputation' of England was established by it in the early French wars. Its military character was cherished both in town and country, as a matter of high national. policy, by repeated acts of Parliament, enjoining the training of its youth in the use of the long bow and in other warlike exercises. This went on til the great political stnaggle of the 17th century, when the middle class in England successfuUy stemmed the wave of despotism which submerged the continental nations. A momentary reaction took place at the Restoration, and the military force of England was then placed on its present footing of being an army for the highest and the lowesf, but not for the middle class; and it has since been retained on this footing through the instrumentality of the purchase system. The only semblance of a reason for the exclusion of this class from the army disappeared when the Reform Bil was passed. Our political differences were then finally composed. The object which the middle class had in view, of establishing this country as a self-governing community, has besn accomplished; and that class has at least as strong an interest in maintaining our existing institutions as any other. Indeed, the British army wiU not be, in the full sense of the word, a constihttional army until the middle class is represented in it. The 101. householders are not the men to tarn the public force against the public liberties. The absence of this element from the army is one main cause of the unceremonious way in which the House of Commons cuts down our military establishments as soon as the pressure for maintaining them in a high state of efficiency has been for the time relaxed. The army is regarded as an aristocratic institution, which is worked for the benefit of a particular class, and it is supposed that patronage and expenditure can be kept in check only by incessant popular vigilance. If the middle class had beeu represented in the army, Mr. Hume would have felt differently about it. There would then have been a bond of sympathy and a guarantee of mutual confidence between the national force and the popular party in the House of Commons. It is absurdly inconsistent to expect that our military administration should be conducted on the business-like principlesfor which the middle class in England is distinguished while we practicaUy exclude that class from the army. What woould be the result in private life if great estates were habitually managed by their lordly owners witlhout the assistance of bankers, solicitors, and stewards? But the main effect of the abolition of purchase would be upon the ranks of the army. A higher class of motives would be substituted for the immoralities of the recruiting system. A fixed proportion of the regimental officers (say one-third or one-fourth) would be selected from the non-commissioned officers. All the administrative corps, except the central superintending body, would be filled by promotion from the ranks. There would thus be scope for every variety of qualification. Trustworthiness and a talent for business would have its reward, as weU as superior education and soldier-like spirit. The British army would become a "C reasonable" and truly honourable service, admission to which would be sought as a privilege, and removal from it would be avoided as a misfortune and disgrace. The regimental schools would be crowded. We should hear no more of Foreign Legions; and when a national exigency arose, like the Russian war or the Indian mutiny, we should be under no anxiety about the means of filling the ranks of our army. I am. hes T-AAA-O, A- AX ENGUSEMAN.
THE MILITIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I venture to call your attention to the very great inconvenience to which the officers of the mUitia regiments remaining disembodied are subjected by the uncertainty in which they are left by the Government as to the probability of their services beingpernianently required. Regiment after regiment, in addition to those first selected, is called out, and no one can form an idea whose tuxn may follow. In common with my brother officers I would make any sacrifice to assist in drilling and procuring volunteers for the army from the militia ; hut we have avocations and pursuits which it requires some hittle arrangement to relin quish, and it wrould be but fair to make known at onec whiach corps will be embodied, and those which wiUl not, 'n order that officers may shape their plans accordigy.

ILLINSS OF EARL FITZWILLLm.-We regret to learn that Earl Fitzwilhiam has had an attack of illness while staying at Marske, near Redcar, on the Yorkshire coast. Mr. Wilson Overend, his Lordship's surgeon, was telegraphed for, and left Sheffield by special train for Redcar station, on the North-Eastern Railway, where he was met and conveyed to Marske in the carriage of the Earl of Zetland. Mir. Overend found Lord Fitzswiliam in a dangerous state, but he subsequently improved, and hopes are now confidently entertained that his'Lordship will be sufficiently recovered to receive the Qaeen and Prince Consort at Wentworth on the 15th of next month, as previously arranged. It is understood that Her Majesty wil remain at Wentworth only one night. An additional gloom has been cast on tbe family circle of the nohle earl by the death of the infant son of Lord and Lady Mtilton; which took place FirP AT BRLXTOX.-Last night a fire took place on the premises belonging to Mr. Samuel Bamford, carpenter. nuider, joiner, &c., No. 5, Csrlton-terzace, Lough. borough-road, Brixton. The premises in which the disaster commenced were nearly 100 feet long, and were used as workshops, in which was deposited a costly stock-in-trade, as well as the whole of the workmen's tools and other effects. The firemen were enabled to extinguish the flames but not before the building in which the fire cezmenced and all it contained were destroyed. BOAT AcomsnnT OFF LYTHAMr.-An accident occurred near Lytham, Lancashire, on Sunday night, by which five persons are sapposed to have been drowned. The scene of the casalty is a sand bank- about a mile and a-half from the Lythnm l ghthouse, and about a mile and a-quarter from the Lytham beach. At half-past 2 o'clock on Saturday afternoon a party of five men,-viz., John Morrow, Richard Forshaw, John Holden, Thomas Green, and Alexander Whittle-left the Old Quay, Preston, accompanied by Mrs. Alice Gabutt, of Blackburn, and her daughter, iatending to sail to the Lytham lighthouse in a boat belonging to Morrow, and walkidg thence a distance of about three miles, to BlackpooL They arrived at Lytham about half-past 5 o'clock, put Mrs. Gabutt and her daughter ashore, cast anchor off the lighthouse, and four of them went to the Coffee-house inn, Marton, near Blackpool, leaving one of the company in charge of the boat. After spending aU the night at this house, they left soon after 8 o'clock the following morning, after having partaken of breakfast, and told the landlord that they were going to the boat, and proposed sailing direct for Preston at once. When they arrived at the boat, it Is supposed they found that the state of the tide would I not answer their departure home, and, getting into the boat, sailed about the coast for a few hours. Morrow and his companions persisted in their determinatioa to sail up to Preston with the midnight ebb tide. Nothing further was then heard of them until Monday forenoon, when, after the tide had gone out, some fishermen from Lytham found the boat firmly embedded In the sand on thne bak, about a mile and a-half from the lighthouse and Ianmed an-arter from the land. In the boat theyfound the bodyofohn Holden entangled in the canvas, which was wrapped aboat his loins, indicating that in his struggle for life ho must have battled with the waves a considerable time by holding on to the saiL The cause of the deplorable accident is supposed to be this :-The deceased persons, while awaiting the ebbing tide, cast oat their anchor on the wrong aide of the boat, and by the action of the tide the boat was driven rather violently against the projecting flake of t-he anchor. By this means a hole was driven Into the bottom of the boat, and she instantly filled and sank An inquest was held on Tuesday evening on the body of Holden, at the Talbot Inn, Lytham, before Mr. Mynes, who, after hearing some evidence, adjoarned the inquest to allow time to find the other bodies. THIE NO=GRAMt MuRDA-Two men have been Frrested on suspicion of murdering the boy found dead on Nottingham-forest on Friday last, and robbing him of his boots. They have not yet been brought up before the maglstrates, but doubts are entertained if the rea culprit is yet in custody. THE LATE HAavEsTs.-¶The harvest on Dartmoor is now completed, and is the bhst that has been known for many years. In the north of CornwaU also the harvest is just finished, and a more bountifal one has not been kn4wn for several years. Potatoes, although a prolific crop, appear to be very much affected wiith be disease In most parts of the wrest of England. The root crops are various. The apple crop in Devonshire is tolerably good, and more cider t an as been manufactured for the last two or three yuars will, it iS said, he mnade this year.
