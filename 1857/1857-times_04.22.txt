On comparing these rates wit, lie English Mint p rice of 31. 17s 10id. per ounce fot standard gold, it appears that gold is about 1-10th per cent, dearer in Pari than in London. By advces from Hamburg the price of gold is 4f24 per markc, and the short exchange on London is 13.4 per 11!. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mfint price is therefore about 2-lOths per cent. dearer vx Hamburg than in London. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sigvht Xs lO8Sii per cent., which, when comnpared with the Mtint par between ihe two counltries, shows that the exchange is against-England; but, after maig allowrance for charges of transport and difference of interesft, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmision of gold either way betwreen England and America. the English funds opened steadily this morning, and ultimately experienced an improvement of an eighth. Consols for money were first quoted 92; to 93, and in consequence of a few purchases on the part of the public and a better general supply of money they advanced late in the day to 93 to i, which w;as the final quotation. IFor the account they left off at 93 to A. Loans on Government securities were obtainable for short periods at 6 per cent. Bank Stock closed at 212 to 214; Reduced, 91*; Nevr Thnree per Cents., 91* to 92; India Stock, 220 to 223; Exchequer-bonds, 984 to B0; and India-bonds, 8s. to 4s. discount. Exchequerbills again improved on ?rarchases by the Government broker, and the prices were, for the June de-. scriptions, 5s. to 2s. discount; March, 4s. discount to par. The discount-market wzas still comparatively easy to-day, and in some exceptional cases transactions are said to have taken place at a fraction below the Bank terms. Foreign securities were rather firmer, but the operations continue unimportant. Turkieh Six per C ent, for the account, were negotiated at 94Ei 94, and 94p; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, at 1d0 and i. The general business comprised-- Austrian Five per Cents., 91; YBrazilian Four-anda-Half per Cents., 99; ChilianSix per cents. 102wi Ecuador new Consolidated, 14t and i; wI'exicah, for account, 23s ; Perutian Four-and-againl per Centd, for account, 77; Rlussian Five per Cents., 105; Sardinian Five per Cents., 91; Sp~anish Three per Cents, for account, 42; the New eferred 25* andy; Spanish Certificates, 6andri; and Four per Cent. Peruvian Dollar-bonds, 56. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates generally were a shade loeer than last post. The closng prices of the French Three per Cent. On the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 25c for money, and 69f. 36c. for the end of the month, showing in the latter case a further fractional decline. The discreditable practices adapted by the speciilators interested in the Russian Railway scheme have received further illustration today, and scarcely a doubt apPearS to be entertained in9any quarter that a deliberate plan had been formed to entrap subscribers by inducing respectabe persons to act unusupectingly the part of decoys. The cases mentioned yesterday are unquestioned, and, if it wereqnecessar, fresh details could be furnished wvhich wvould probably fix the responsibility of these attempts in a manner to leave no uncertainty as to their design or origin. In consequence of the exposure there has been an almost total disinclination to-day on the part of the deaiers to have anything to do with the shares, and the price of to u prenium was entirely nominal. Such as have been bought are believed to have been taken by parties acting upon orders from Vienna. One case is mentioned of a mercantile hose wrriting from D)unkirk on behalf of a friend-whether a clergyman or otherwise is not stated-to know how he could invest 20,000o.-apparently the favourite sua -inOthes shares in London. The rejoinder was that, as he is a French purchaser, his best course will be to apply for an allotment in Paris, where the quantity to be dicosed of is knon to have been beyond the capacity of the market, and where, in the unlikely event of the allotment not being granted, he can at all events obain them on the The ietters from Paris describe an uneasy feeling. The contrivance of the Government to obtain a new loan by compelling the Bank of France to double their capital seemes to have occasioned considerable dissatisfactIon, and it is potstively sated that the opinions of the Directors were unanimouly against the measure. It appears that the Bank is to be allowed increased powfers of issue, which will pro. bably lead to the circulation of notes of a denomination lower than those at present authorized.n It i mentionedethatM Mires has been fumnonedbefore the Tribunal of Commerce in connexion with complaints regarding his mode of putting forth the shares of the Roman railways. He at first announced that the unuber wouldbe 100,000, andr after large dealings had been effected on this sup-. position, a strong action was produced on the market by a notification that the number would be reduced in order that a certain proportion mright be reserved for the clergy. The commercial accounts from New York confirm the eppectation that gold remittances to tbis country willlbo resuniedin the courseofa few wee The stock-market continued heavy, and another decline of about 2 bper cent had occurred in most descriptions of railway securities, notwithstanding a considerable expansion in the paper circulation of the variousbans.a It is said that the importersof European goods have not lately been trans g a profitable business, and that the Western merchants are paying less promptly than usual, in consequence of their attention being too much absorbed in land speculations. The weather was cold antddry, and unfavourable for the growing wheat. The Canadian advices on this occasion state that the Parliament, before its adjournment for the Easter recess, had voted a subsidy of 50,000!. per annum for a weekly line of Canadian screw steamers, to sail from the St. Lawrence during summer and Portland, in 3!aine, during winter. Hitherto the voyages have been fortaightly in the surmer, and monthly in sinter. Both Houses have also adopted an Act for establishing a decimal currency, to take effect from the 1st of next January . The pubLic accounts are to be kept in dollars and cents, and all account rendered to the Government are to be in dollars and cents, with tne addition, if persons choose of columns containing the equivsa lent in the pounds, ihillings, and pence of the Halifan curnency. the coroner's inquest in connexion with the accident on the Great Western Railway of Canada had resulted in a verdict exonerating the company from blame. At a meeting of the North British Australian Company, held to-day, Colonel Oliphant presiding, it was agreed to appoint a committee of investigation, and an adjournment was consequently agreed to. The next meeting is to be called previously to the 1stlof July, and it is thought the intermediate time wil be fully occupied in carrying out the inquiry. The discussion was of a vialent and lrregular character, but as the Chairman, immdnediately the proposal for a committee was made, met the wishes of the shareholders, the details enierei into were less than might have been anticipated. The positiou of the accounts, the expenditure upon the Kawau mining property, and the general ill success of management, were the principal points urged, to which it was considered unnecessary to offer a reply, as the investigation will be immediately commenced. With regard to the sale of the interest of the North British Australian Company in the Bon Accord property, the Directors endeavoured to elicit the opinion of the proprietors, and, the majority declining to sanction the proceeding until the report of the committee shall have been completed, the question stands for the present postponed. At the annual meeting of the Grand Surrey Docks and Canal Company, which took ylace today, Mr. J. Wilson presiding, the dividend declared was 4 per cent., and 1,0001. was placedtotherewerve fund, leavirg a balance of 5,501!. to the credit of next account. The report stated that there had been an increase in the Liumber of wood ships entering the docks the last year, and that the first issue of new shares, amounting to 60,7001., had all been taken, and the greater part paid up in full, 27,0001. of the sum remaimming on deposit at interest, awaiting the completion of the new works, which are steadily proceeding. The East India and China Association have published their usual comparative statement of the number of ships, British and foreign, with their aggregate tonnage, entered inward and cleared outwards with cargo, from and to plae witbiu the limits of the East India Company's charter. from the 1lt of January to the 31st of March, 1856 aud 1857. According to the statistics of vessels entered inward the return for the port of London shows a decrea-e of 1 vessel, with an increase of 197 tons, the arrivals in 1856 having been 166 vessels, with an aggregate capacity of 100,513 tons; and in 1857' 165 vesrels, with an aggregate capacity of 100,710 tons. Tn the case of Liverpool the decreae is 9 vessels and 8,057 tons, the difference between 70 vessels, with an aggregate capacity of 53,703 tons, and 61 vesels with an aggregate capacity of 45,646 tons. Bristol exhibits an increase of 6 vessels and 1,299 tons, the arrivals in 1856 having been 7 veesels, with an ag to capacity of 3,723 tons, and in 1857 13 vessaels, ith an aggregate capacity of 5,022 tons. In the case of the Clyde there has been a decrease of 2 vessels, but an increase of 1,548 tons, the arrivals in 1856 having been 10 vessels, with an aggregate capacity of 2,692 tons, and, in 1857, 8 vessels, with an aggregate capacity of 4,240 tons. The net result of tnese figures is a decrease of 6 vessels and 5,013 tons, the difference between 253 vessels with an aggregate capacity of 160,631 tons and 247 vessels with an aggregate capacity of 155,618 tons. The principal decrease has been in the arrival of vessels from Calcutta. The statistics of clearances outward show an increase in the return for the port of London of 29 vessels and 14,754 tons, the departures in 1856 having been 163 vessels, with au aggregate capacity of 100,689 tons, and in 1857 192 vessels, with an aggregate capacity of 115,443 tons. In the case of Liverpool the increase is 47 vessels, and 43,532 tons, the difference between 89 vessel with an aggregate capacity of 69,247 tons in 1856, and 136 vessels with an aggregate capacity of 112,779 tons in 1857. The return for Bristol exhibits an increase of five ' vessels and 2,441 tons, the difference between one vessel with an aggregate capacity of 1,182 tons in 1856, and six vessel with an aggregate capacity of 3,623 tons in 1857. In the case of the Clyde there is a decrease of 4 vessels and 1,054 tons, the departures in 1856 having been 22 vessels, with an aggregate capacity of 13,510 tons, and in 1857 18 ves , with an aggregate capacity of 12,456 tons. The net result is an increase of 77 vessels, and 59,673 tons, the departures in 1856 having been 275 vessels with an aggregate capacity of 184,628 tons, and in 1857 352 vessels, with an aggregate capacity of 244,301 tons. The increare in the deprtures has been in vessels destined for New South Wale, Calcutta, Bombay, Mauritius, and the Cape of Good Hope.

STATE OF TRADE. All descriMANCHESTEB, APRsa 21. Al descritions of cloth have been more difficult of sale, and the mar et has been dhtly in favour of the b. er, especially for India and a whirtings which have do. dined about lid. per plece. There is no accumulation of stock worth naming yet, and consequentl most other clothe except those named are not quotably lowyer, though difficult of sale. Domestics are very sluggish and unsaleable, anc many of the manufacturers of this description of cloth are running their mills short time-some only three days a-week -in order to bring down the production nezerto n eali with the demand. The chief obstacle to business is the stringency of the money-market, buyers being unwilling to give high prices for cloth and pay the present heavy de mands lor discounts. In Tarns there has been a ratber better market, without chainge in prices. The Germau, and buyes for the Mediterranean, are the prsinpal puI chasers, but 30s, 40's, and 50's mule for India hAve a been in fair request at extreme prices.

BOWRIN'S SIAM.* Thee volumes wiU be scanned at the present bOnjuncture with a very natural curiosity, but with a turioity which we may fairly say will not be satisfied if they are looked to for proofr, of the vanity Md pretentiousness which are so freely laid to the .harge of Sir John Bowring. Whatever natural folbles may be imputed to him, at least they are tot apparent here, for his personal views and exploita make a very small portion of the bulky vetavo, which were one result of his mission. His V=couut of the Siamese may be open to objections on account of repetitions and malarrangement, bat It does to a very remarkable extent give prominence to the labours and researchea of his predecessors, blnd it modestly accounts for his own success in Companrion vrith their efforts and disappointmonteB. Not only does Sir John Bowring do ample justice to the earlier writers on Sia, from Camoens down to Bishop PaUegoix, by Dopious extracts from their descriptions anld dOlquisitions, but he explain the failure of former ,1sons of his countrymen without taking any tmdue credit to himself. The frustration of Mr. Crawfurd's mission in 1822 and of Sir James Brooke's negotiations in 1851, with the shortcomings In Captain Burney's treaty of 1826, are fairly referred to causes which Sir Johnadmitswere nolonger operative when he followed these negotiators. The nfluence of the two Somdetches, who had been interested in former monopolies of Siamese trade, was then in its wane. The more intelligent of the Siamese, as is shown by some remarkable anecdotes, were becoming convinced of the advantages of free Commerce, and the first and second Kings of Siam were imbued with liberal doctrines derived from their extraordinary acquaintance with Western civilization. To these singularly able personages Sir John Bowring very properly ascribes the facilities which enabled him to succeed in his object, and their capacities and accomplishments, to which we shall preeently refer, are the most interesting and prominent topic of his volumes. At all events, as we intimated, we cannot discover, from the Erst page to the last, that self-importance or vainglory which he is said, truly or not, to have manifested elsewhere. His account of Siam is not, indeed, particularly .raphic or picturesque, but it is curiously interesting. Siam resembles Egypt in its dependence on the river Meinans, which flows directly southward, and the resemblance must strike any one who observes the straightness of its course, the parallel ridge of mountains, and the sinuosities of the mouths by vhich it empties itself into the Gulf of Siam. The lower portion of the valley of the Meinam constitutes nearly the whole of Siam Proper and abounds with tropical productions of extraordinary luxuriance, the fertility of its teeming soil being annually renewed by the periodical rains and the inundations of the river. Nowhere except in the island of Java -Is Sir John tasted fruits of such flavour and size in such variety. Such a profusion of flowers either grow upon the river's banks or were presented to bim by the inhabitants that his path seems to have been strewn with garlands and coronals, while he was further amused by the novelty of wandering fish, which glide over the wet banks and travel for miles tolosethemselvesintheponds and poolsof the jungle. The population of this happy valley, together with its dependencies, is estimated at about 6,000,000 by Pallegoix, but Sir John Bowring assumes it to be less than 6,000,000. Of these the Siamese proper make about 2,000,000; the rest are Laos, Malays, Chinese, &c., the latter in the largeat proportion; and it is remarkable how large a portion of the latter, and, indeed, of the whole population of the kingdom, is congregated at the capital, Bangkok. which extends along the banks of the Meinam for several miles, and is estimated to contain 400,000 souls. Bangkok, from the description of it, must be a kind of Oriental Venice, though it is only within the lst century that it has become of such im'portance, having superseded the earlier capital Atyuthia, which was destroyed by the Burmese, and which wras not so conveniently near to the Gulf of Siam. A large number of the population here live on the water as at lenten, and the manufactures and commerce of the kingdom are here centered chiefly in the hands of the Chinese, who retain their national characteristicc, and are not confounded with the Siamese among whom they mingle. The prospects of this migratory and unsociable race, frrespecMve of the di'diculties they occasion to ourselves, are growing in interest, and we readily avail ourselves of this account of their present position in Siam. "Chinese.-The extraordinary diffusion of the Chineae emigrants over all the regions from the most western of the idlands of the Indian Archipelago, in the Straitsasettlements, in Slam and Cochin China, and now extending over a coneiderable portion of Western America, particularly in Cali. fornia, and reaching even Australia and Polynesia, is one of the most remarkable of the events of modern history, and is likely to exercise a great influence on the future con. dition of man; for the Chinese do not migrate to mingle with and be absorbed among other tribes and peoples; they preserve their own language, their ownnationality, their own cestume and religious usages, their own traditions, habits, and social organization. Though they intermarry with the races among wlhom they dwell the Chinese type becomes predominant, and the children are almost invariably educated on the father's model, the influence of the mother seeming almost annihilated. And though the Chinese frequently acquire large fortunes, great influence, and sometimes high rank as a consequence of their pro. sperity, the ties that bind them to their country seem never to be broken; and the tides of population flow Chinaward with every south-western monsoon, to be replaeed bya stronger stream when the monsoon of the north-east sends the junks on their wonted way towards the south. It Is estimated that in the kingdom of Siam there are more thau 1 500 COO Chinese settlers- in the city of Bangkok alone there are supposed to be 200,000. In fact, all the active business appears to be in their hands. Nine out of 10 of the floating bazaars which cover for miles the two banks of the Ielnam are occupied by Chinamen- very many of them are married to Siamese women, for a 6hinawoman scarcely ever leaves her country, but the children are invariably educated to the Chinese type; the tail is cultivated if it be a boy, and the father alone seems to model the child's nature and education. Yet, that strong parental affection which has been remarked as one of the characteristic virtues of the Chinese is almost invariably exhibited. Fathers are constantly playing with and carrying about their children, encouraging their gambols, teaching themto observe, pleased when they are noticed by strangers, and generally deeming their children objects of pride and pleasure. With rare exceptions the Siamese women are wel treated by their Chinese husbands. They seem to be inspired with a greater love of labour, occupy themselves more busily with domestic concerna, and generauy appear to improve under the influence of the foreign element. The Chinese not only occupy the busiest and the largest bazaars, but their trading habits descend to the very lowest articles of barter; and hundreds of Chinese boats are vibrating up and down the river, caling at every house, penetrating every creek, sup. plying all articles of food, raiment, and whatever ministers to the daily wants of life. They penetrate to and trafdc with the interior wherever profits are to be realized. As a community they are nearly isolated from the Siamese, though professing, for the most part, the same religion. They have their own temples, and carry on their worship of Budda, not according to the usages of the priests of Siam, but folowing the customs and traditions of China; and their Buddhism, as in China itself, is held in subservience to their reverence for the teachings and writings of the Chinese sages,-Confucius, Mlencius, Sze mat ze, and the ancient teachers of their native land. The signs over their warehouses, shops, and houses are all written in Chinese,in the Chinese language they carry on all their correspondence; nor do I remember an example of a Chinaman being able to write, though they almost all speak, the Slamese language. Over their doors are the camo inscriptions one is accoustomed to see in China, such as 'May the Zve felicities dwell in this abode.' The moral aphorisms, the fragments of poetry which are suspended on the walls in China, written on scrous or tablets, always in pairs, decorate the houses of the Chinese established in Siam. But the Siamese keep the Chinese in absolute subjection, and while I was in Bangkok I saw no instace ofresisce to the native authority. q Os 4nowvcr aserious insurreotion of the Chinese Population m,mn acea t"he Government, buit the insurrection w,as soon suppressed.t A'Chinese mnercbant of enormous wealth whohel athe opium monopoly, with, I -was informed, more than 90 other monopolies, nhs beon rAised to the rank of nobility, and was present among the mnltitude of prostrate nobles, dressed in the distinction of mandarin costume, when that article of the treaty was read to them which abolished the whole system of monopoly, and established free trade from the month of April, 1856. Certainly, he bowed his head in silence, but looked as if a hundred thunderstorms were eoncentrated in that proud, scouful, yet resigned ex- pres3ion. He had been told his doom at a oonSerenoe with the princi.Pal ministers; but, as the opiura mono oly the most precious and profitable of all, was preserved t him, he had the sagacity to feign a wiling resignation, and to say be wiould employ his capitl for the future in legitimate initead of privileged commerce. Though a small numbeer of the Chineee profited by the farms, the enormous majority expressed their gret delight at the emancipation wrhich the treaty provided." That Sir John himself was not prejudiced against this singular people is evident from the following passage in another part of the name volume:- *Let it not, however, be supposed that I look with any feelings but those of complacency upon the exodus of the Chinese from their native land, and their outpourings on aIU adjacent regions. I believe there is no class of settlers who, under proper control, are so likely to be useful that the very quality, the passion toraCq,Uiring wealth, Which leads them to dare all danger and difficulty, is amostvaluablerecommenda. tion. Their own habits of subordinaton,-their inborn and inbred respect for authority-their gregarious spirit, which drives them into associations of every sort, prvate and public, praiseworthy and pernioious,-only require a thorough knowledge of their character tobe turnedCtothbesta count. The Siamese themselves, however, appear in a much more amiable light than the Chinese strangers within their gates, if we may trust to Sir John's accounts of their temper and habits. His work contains various chaDters on these and similar topics, either compiled frorm his predecemors or derived from his own observations, and the inference from the whole is favourable to the Siamese and implies their striking superiority to most other Orientals. Humanity to animals is, indeed, enjoined by their religion, and the tamenews of mnaty living creatures which in Europe fly from the presence of man, and which was observed by Dr. Bowring, is hardly surprising. In more than one instance Siamese gardeners have quitted the service of Europeans, because they were unwilling to destroy reptiles and vermin. Rich men buy live fish to have the "merit" of restoring them to the sea, and on certain holydays of the month fishing and hunting are prohibited. But it is more important to learn that the condition of women is better in Siam than in most Oriental countries, that they we on a nearer equality with the men, and that, in virtue of a milder creed, they enjoy more liberty and exhibit more elevation of character, at the same time that in respect of superior docility they compare with other Siamese specimens ferce naturce. Another favourable trait is the religious tolerance which prevails, and which has beenl manifested in the treatment of the various missions, Catholic or Protestant. As regards the general spirit in which religious discussions are conducted, Sir John averm that he has seldom met with, so much tolerance s among the Siamese. it They seem never unwilling to listen to arguments recommending religions different from their own." But it is desirable to cautionthesupporters of mission ryenterpise against cherishing too sanguine expectations on this account, for the more intelligent Siamese, the King even included, hold a somewhat pantheistic theory that aU religions are true in the sense of some special adaptation to the nations who profess them, and that Buddhism is eternally appropriate for the dwellers by the Meinam. The King, who is one of the highest authorities on the subject, even endeavours to reconcile his religion and his philosophy, and " contends that there is nothing in Buddhism, properlyunderstood, whichis repugnant tothefacts established by astronomical and geological science." Of the Bhuddists, however, there are two parties, and the moral or the ceremonial precepts have superior attractions in either case. There is a wide latitude to choose from in the maxims of a religion which commence with the injunction to "kWiU no human being" and descend to the rubric that " to walk in the street without having buttoned the proper button, and to enter a boat without unfbuttoning the same button, are sins." It is a happy practical consequence of the whole that, besides the comparative gentleness of the Siamese in the relations of which we have spoken, their laves also are well treated, " as well as servants in France," says Bishop PaUegoix; that capital execution, even of criminals, is exceedingly rare, and that the bodies even of these are only impaled after death. The moral or immoral curiosities which exist under this mild dispensation are described by Dr. Bowring. Long nails indicate a decided tendency to dissipation, and their growth is encouraged with hog's fat or garlic. A certain Siamese observes that "the man who keeps long finger nails is a man of dissolute mind. His heart rides on primpness. He is the master of harlots, and desires to deck himself that he may s'roll about and talk with the women, that they may have a heart to love him. Men of this sort are few; among a hundred men there wiU be about forty." Others of the Siamese have confidence in lovephiltres, which are sold to them by their magicians. They credit the ghoul and vampire superstitions, and believe that a magician can reduce a buffalo to the size of a pea, which, being swaUowed by the person he is employed to bewitch, thereupon reassumes its former shape, and bursts the interior of the wretch who has swallowed it. Demons are believed to be the keepers of hidden treasures, and the dread of such demons and of ghosts is universal in Siam. Sir John Bowring beheld frequently little rafts of bamboo, with small images of human beings (representing families) and offerings of betel-nut, rice, fruits, and flowers, lighted with smaU tapers, the whole floating on the river for the purpose of conciliating the spirits of the waters. Curious ceremonies are performed at funerals, esDecially of women who have died in childbirth, with the view of disappointing the appropriative desires of the dealers in the black arts. Alchemy is no longer fashionable, but amulets, or talismans, are still considered so potent that if it can be proved that either a plaintiff or defendant has worn one during the proceedings in an action at law he is condemned ipso facto to lose his suit. In respect of medicine the Siamese are more advanced, for though they have much confidence in their native doctors, yet they follow a custom for the protection of the patient which might, perhaps, be introducedc with advantage into other countries, and of which the simple condition is " No cure, no pay." A negotiation is entered into as to the sum to be paid for the cure, and the amount is settled by a written contract, the doctor always demanding two wax candles for an offering to the God of Medicine, and six salungs (equal to 3s. 9d.) for the cost of medicines. If the patient's health improve under the doctors care the visits continue; if the doctor thinks the case hopeless his visitS cease, and there is an end of the contract. There are two medical schools or systems in Siam-the Indian and the Chinese-which contend for the mastery, and the following, which is a prescription for "morbific fever," is said to combine the pharmacopseia of both:- * One portion of rhinoceros's horn, one of elephant's tusk, one of tiger's and the same of crocodl's teeth, one of hear's tooth; one portior composedaof three parts bones ofvulture, raven, and goose; one portion of bison'sand another of stag's horn ; one portion of sandal. These ingredients to be mixed together on a stone with pure water. One half of the mixture to be swallowed, the rest to be rabbed into the body; after which the morbific fever will depart." But whether at the same moment the patient will depart also to the Siamese Hades we are not informed, nor is it added which of the rival systems will be held responsible. The laws of the Siamese are contained in about 70 volumes, and, as a whole, their code must be deemed superior to the Chinese. We observe that they have asimple system of pleading, that bail is allowed except in criminal cases, and that an appeal lies to the Kingin person. Their criminal coae, for an Oriental people, is not severe, for decapitation, which is its mode of capital punishment, is only awarded for treason, murder, aggravated robberies, piracy, and arson. The blemish in the administration of Siamese justice is the venality of the judges, for from the chief judge to the lowest clerk all are said to have their price. Witiesses also are incapacitated on so many grounds that there must be often a difficulty in procuring proofs of the most open transactioni. Moral, physical, and intellectual impediments are allowed to an extent which we should imagine included half the population. Many trades, even, are altogether excluded such as goldsmiths, braziers, blacksmiths, shoemaicers; and the potters are shut out in consequence of a murder committed on a virtuous man by a potter ages ago. It is conjectured that midwives are excluded because they may be called away suddenly in the middle of their testimony. Moreover, the Siamese oath, which is something in the style of the curse of St. Ernulphus, with the addition of Oriental imagery, iB adapted, as we should imagine, to scare away the rest of the population, and +" leave the judges of Siam in the enjoyment of a perpetual holy y. This interesting people is yarticularly musical, and their music e& Jnm ey play chew slo, and patronize pugilistic encounters, cock and fih fights, and battle8 of crfckets and the formic leo. They have introdued lotteries and vaccination, aud have an institution of a mock king who performs on. a grand scale the part of a Mayor of Garratt. Their government is a pure despotism, mildly administered by the accomplished brothers who are at present Kings of Siam, and whom we look upon as the most remarkaDle personages in the world. These gentlemen, up to]851, were kept out of their Royal rights by a usurper, and were so superior to the average of Europeans in the same predicament that they qualified themselves to administer the kingdom at his decease. Their learning and talents would really distinguish them anywhere, apart from the crowd of gentlemen with dynastic pretensions, and they may be said to have laid the beginning of a new era for Siam by applying the lessons they learnt in adversity. The first King might fairly claim to be made an F.R.S. for his varied qualifications, scientific and literary. He is able to calculate an eclipse and the degrees of latitude and longitude. is a profound scholar in Pali and Sanscrit, has learnt Latin from the French Catholic missionaries, and can read and write English, as we shall presently see. He has introduced into his country a printing press, with English and Siamese types, and, hving constructed the first chimneys ever seen in Siam, he is applying his geological knowledae in a search for native coaL The second King iB also an excellent English scholar, and writes a hand which would qualify him to be an engrossing clerk to an English solicitor. Ee has also studied Euclid and Newton, has read the works of Sir Walter Scott, and in evidence of his appreciation of them has called a ship after his name. The first Eing inquired about the discovery of the planet Neptune, and discussed the astronomical bearings of the English calendar with Sir John Bowring. Ee mentioned also his intention to write a history of his tines in English, for which he is not disposed to seek any assistance. The second King was solicitous about the latest news from Europe, made many inquiriie about the Qaeen and the Royal family, her age, the number of her children, whether she had gone to Paris to meat the French Emperor, Ac. Both appear to receive many of the newest English works, and both will doubtless read this book of Sir John Bowring, and, in case either of them should honour us by also reading this article, we take the opportunity here of conveying to them our assurances of respect and admiration for their characters and accomplishments. So far from these accomplislments being those of mere pedants, we find the first King capable of displaying a practical wisdom which strikinglyreminds us of Benjamin Franklin:- " A missonay mentioned to me that the King, when a bonze, and carrying on his studies in the temple to which he retreated, had gatheredaround him many young men, whom he was fond of instructing in Emropean sciences, and en. couraging them to study the prog of knowledge. He illustrated his views by the following allegory:-Two men start from the jungle loaded with the coarse articles it produces-the fibres of the hemp, for exmple; they move onwarcds, and come to a p lee where Itere is more valuable material, as cotton. The foolih and unimproveablemanpersists In carrying his coarse and unprofitable burden of hemp; hiswiser companion exchanges his hemp for the finer and more valuable material. They still move on, and come to a slk district. The fool sticks to bis hemp, the wiEe baUters his ootton for silk; and thus they reach the end of their journey, one exhausted with carrying an almost worthess and heavy load, the other having brought with ease a profitable and valuable investment." The King also is determined on a reform of Buddhism; but again we caution Exeter-hall not to be too 3anguine that this is a prelude to the substitution of Christ ian verity. Both he and his people appear to be attached to their faith, and in some particular this attachment is strikingly manifested in the midst of their cordial reception of European views in other matters. The King, in negotiating his treaty of commerce with Sir John Bowring, appointed a day for an audience which had been pronouncedauspiciousby the astrologers, and the most precious present he could make to the Queen was a tuft of hair from the tall of a white elephant, which, in the opinion of hiself and other orthodox Siamese, is one of the farona of the inearnation of Buddha. The white elephant is an important consideration in the following letter which he wrote with his own hand to welcome Sir John's arrival:- "Raj-Mondlen Hous, Grand Place, " Bangkok, 27th March, 1855. "My gracious Friend,-It give me to-day most rejoyful pleasure to learn yourExcetencysarrival here, as certamedly as your Excellency remained now on board the steamer 'Rattler' which accompAnied vnth a brig of war.

I have just returned from old city Ayudia of Siam 15 days ago with the beautiful she elephant which your Excellency will witness here on your Excellency's arrivaL "S. P. P. 9. MOrGXUrT, the King." "To His Excellency Sir John Bowrng, " Night Dr. of laws, &c, a., hc." As in many English letters, the dominant idea comes up in the postscript,-" European negotiators and European notions are perfectly welcome, but leave us, if you please, to revere our white elephants." We do not propose to give any extracts from Sir John Bowrings personal narrative, which gives an account of the ceremonials with which he was received and the manner in which the treaty was negotiated. Sufflce it to say that he encountered few difficulties, that he was very handsomely treated, and that he succeeded both in the substantial objects of his mission and in vindicating his dignity as an envoy from England. The more intelligent Siamese were already prepared to admit a greater freedom of commerce on grounds their clear perception of which is surprising. The Prime Minister himself had studied the question, and even rehearsed the discussion in which he expected Sir John would engage him. "Amnong other curious evidences of the state of his nind, I learnt that on one occasion he sent for a forei gentleman whose opinion he greatly valued, and, in the presenc e of manyJ persons, said to his adviser,- "' Now you must make yourself Sir John Bowring ;- answer me, Why do you come to Siam ?-Wo are become your neighbours; we wish to be your friends. Let us be friendly neighbours. We want to buy and to sell; we have thins you would like, you have those we want. Don't shut the door. "'The door is not shut !-Is there no boom to stop the passag of the river at Pakldat ?

" ' Howv can we do without taxes ?-You cannot do without taxes; they should be moderate, not excesive. Besides, there are articles you will not let us buy at all-rice, for instance, and teak wood. " 'Teak wood ! weThave none to spare. We want it. I wish anybody would fiad more. - There is abundance in the juge. "'- 'No! it is a great way off, far from the river. We have buffaloes and elephants-see how little they bring?You do not encourage those who come to buy. " ' Ta olf rice! Why, in China they have two crops a year.

And now the engines make it so cheap, that no one in Siam can live by making thread for cloth.- Some suffer, but far more are benefited by cheaper and better clothes. "'I don't know tihat they are better clothed.

COURB OF ALDERMEN. Yesterday a Court was held for the deptoh of public business. BIRTH OP A PRINCESS. The LORD MAYOR.-Gentlemen, since our last meetlng I have received a commnunication from Sir George Grey announcing that the CQueen has been safely delivered of a Princess. The communiation was ordered to be entered upon the journals of the Court. SOUTHWAR-K QUARTER SESSON-S. The Loby kAYOR read the folowing letter, addressed to himself by the High Baiif of Southwark: "Town-ba%l Southwark, April 4. My Lord,-Your Lordship In desired to attend a Geneial Quarter Sesiohe of the Pace appoinut to be held in and for the borough of Slouthiwark, at she COurt-hoiie, onL St. Margaret's-hill. within the mid boroub, on Thhursay,the9th dayof April, atthehour of the clock in the forenoon precisely, then and there to hold a Oourt. I have the hosour to be, my Lord, "Your Lordshp' most obedient serankt, `W. PRITCHARD, HLigh Baiiff "To the Right Hon, the Lord Masor." The LooD MAYoit said that, in consequence of receiving this letter to himself, the Recorder, 3Mr. John Clark (clerk of arraigns at the Central Criminal Conrt), and other gen- tlemen, having most important duties to discharge at the Old Bailey, proceeded to the borough for the purpose, as t-hey upposed, of holding a court - but they found that no jury had been summoned, nor had any arrangements been made for the transaction of any judicial business. Mis object in nowr mentioning this matter was, that it might be referred to the General Parpoees Committee to ascertain whether this farce, that waz enacted from year toy r, of summoning himself and the law officers of the corpoortion to the Southwark Sessions, when there was no buiaess whatever to be transacted there, might not be dispensed with. (Hear, hear,) Sir P. LAuRIE said that the existing prchtce of summoning the Lord Mayor, the law officers of the corportion, and ajury to the Southwark Town-hall, to despatch busi: ness which could not by any possibility come before them, tended to cast great ridicule upon the corporation. HE hoped that the matter would now be referred to a com. nittee, and that the evil practice would be disoontinuea forthwith. He moved that the letter of the Eigh Bailiff be referred to the General Purposes Comumittee. Mr. Alderman SIDNx seconded the motion, which was carried unanimousy. THE COMmIOE OJ POlFCE. Mr. Woodthorpe read the following resolntion, which had been passed at a Court of Common Council on the 26th ult, "That this Court expree Its surprbe and dispproval at ihe step taken by the Oummiesioner of Polise In having, without pulls vacated his ofcicalresideuce, and thus violated the couditiono hs appointment-viz., 'residense withiu the city;' and retaining a su convicton of It neoesity and lmportane, it herebyrequet theCor of Mayor and Aldermen to enforce thae msme; and require that oficer immlOlately to oceupy the residence provided for him, and report forthwith to this Court. Mr. Alderman SDNEY.-I think that the only way in which we can deal with that resolution will be to forward a copy of it to she conmnmioner, and await his reply. Mr. Alderman RuMeEiRRY moved that the matter be referred to the General Purposes Committee to consider, and that in the meantime a copy of the resolution be forwarded to the Commissioner of Police. Mr. Alderman SIDNEY seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously. THE IMTROPOLITAN SALOON ONMIUSES. Sir B. W. CABDEN presented the following memorlal, which was read by Mr. Woodthore "TO THE WrGsir HOW. - LORD M,o AND THEB CoURT OF ATLDERMENw.

Mr. Alderman H4AE said that on Saturday last ir. Alderman Wilson, Mr. Alderman Challis, and himself were sitting on the Police Committee when one of the timekeepers at the Flower-pot reported that a saloon omnibus had obtruded itself upon the stand, and that its driver had refused to move it off when requested to do so. Upon inquiry it turned out that it was not an omnibus that had a recognized time appointed to it, and the magistrates thereupon advised the representatives of the company to come before the Court It appeared that the convenience of the public had beenatly studied by the company, and he f3ir. Alderman le) trusted that the memorial would reeeive the favourable consideration of the Court Sir IL W. CAnxEN.-I thiin it right to mention that as soon as the siloon omnibuses were started the London Omnibus Com any gve instructions to their servants to drive one ommbus immediately before and another imme. ately after each saloon omnibus. So strictly has this direction been carried out that when the other day it was necessary for one of the saloon omnibuses to be taken to Drury.lane for the parpose of having a part of its spring repaired, it was preceded and followedon its way thither by omnibuses belonging to the London Company, which actually remained in front of and behind it during the operation of repairing the spring. lUpon being remonstrated with, the servants of the London Company said they had no alternative but to obey their orders, wvhich wvere " one behind and one before, wrherever you go." rr. Alderman BOSE.-Ir the event of the prayer of the memoralists being granted, will the new comnpany be amenable to sll the rules and regulations which apply to the omnibuses ot other companies or individuals? Iask the question, because when this subject was under discussion it was intimated, on the part of the new company, that if we did not appoint them a time they should tal e it. Arx. Alderman HuNPTERY.-The timelceaeprs appointed are paid by the omnibus proprietors, and if this company's omnibuses come upon the rank they must pay a proportionate share of the expense. Mr. Pope (secretary to the Saloon Company).-Of course, whatever is necessary will be paid. Sir E. W. CARDnE.-Everybody who has onee ridden in a saloon omnibus wil always be glad to ride in it aain. Although the London Omnibus Company started with the idea of giving good accommodAtion to the public, it is manifest that sucb aecommodation was not afforded. The saloon omnibus does afford every neceesary accommodation, comfort, and convenience, and it is a most delightful mode of conveyance to travel by. Mr. Alderman Rosy.-That is not quite the question before the Court, and it is not that with which we have to deal. It will be our duty, while doing justice to all parties who submit to our regulations, to see that the public convenience is properly studied, and any arrangements that may be come to vwth respect to the manner in which the increasingtrafficby omnibus is carred on mustbeof the most binding and effective character. Mr. Alderman SIDNEY.-If this matter be referred to a committee, I hope they wvil have power to confer with the law officers of the corDoration, because our orders, I am told, as far as omnibus sfands in the city are coneerned, are not made agreeably to act of Parliament. The memorial was then referred to the General Purposes Committee.

ThE AERi AxI MOBAD ?.-Paei relating to the conflBation of the territories of the Ameer Ali Morad have been published, on the motion of Mx. Isc Butt, the member for Youghai in the last Parliament. It includes a mass of correspondence on the subject. It appears that the Amoeer fraudulently altered the treaty of Nownahur concluded between himself and Meer Rooston and Meer Nusseer K2hn, so as to substitute, among the possessions to him ceded, instead of the village of "thelab, the pergunnabs of 3Reerpoor, Mathele, and Mehurkee. Tis flagrant offence was held by a special commision appointed to investigate the matter to be fully proved, and a subsequent memorial of the Meer Ali Morad In nowise shook the evidence on shich his Highnesr was convicted, and muited of a portion of his territory by way of punishment. The memorial in question is a formidable affair in point of length, occupyng 40 eae of the paper before us. The revenue obtained by the augmentation of territory arising out of the transactions with his Highness amounts to 2,61,043 rupees (net).

, THE MILTRY COMMUNIOATIONS OF ; ZTRANSCAUOSIAN RUSSIA.* A now map of the Caucasua and the contiguous povinces has been recently put out from the topographioa1 Department of the War-office. It would unquestionably bare excited much interest if it had appeared three years earlier, but at present the attention of the publie is engrosed with newer objects, and Colonel Jervs's last production is not likely to obtain so much notice as it deserves. Nevertheless, if our staff-officers are in future to be properly educated for their duties, one of the first essentials is that they should both be accustomed to the use of good maps and that good maps should be readily procurable by them; and in this view we hope that the one before ns may be regarded as the first of a rell-selected series the non-profesonal I student who consults it will no doubt be surprised at one feature which was necesary in order to pre. serve that perspicuity which in military maps is the first requisite. Although it includes one of the most mountainous portions of the world-Armenia and the whole of the Caucaian chain-no hint is given by the engraver of the existence of a single bill. Streams, roads, their quality and their length, are noted earefully and engraved clearly; but there ie none of that shaded outline of the mountain ranges which, arbitrary and uncertain as it is, gratifies the imagination in the case of ordinary maps. However, every one accustomed to use; map for practical purpoe wi be well aware that the les pictorial it is the better, and in the instance before us will desiderate nothing more than possibly the marking of the watershed between the different river systems, and the altitudes (where ascertained) of the mountain pames or otherwise important points. The one of these two features is to be found in the beautiful maps of Koch published at Berlixn in 1850, and the other is teat of Kiepert; and pro. bably the only reason for their not appearing in Colonel Jervis's map is that he wished pretty nearly to reproduce the Russian offieial document which he takes as his basis, without any great admixture of foreign matter, of whatever authority. The accurate detail of distances and communications, which are set down by Colonel Jervis on the authority of the Russian engineer offlcers, will now enable any one readily to see the extreme peril in which +he Transcaucasian provinces must have been placed during the late war, especially after the command of tho Sea of Azoff passed into the hands of the Western Powers. It is by means of these pos. sessions that Russia exercise. her influence over Persia and Asiatic Turkey. The province of Erivan, inhabited chiefly by Armenians, who are well affected to the Russian sway, and containing Ekmiadzin, the seat of the Armenian patriarch, whose inIluence is enormous over the members of his communionalloverAia,furniishesabaseofoperationsagalAs either the one or the other. The resources of the country, which is highly cultivated by a careful sys, tem of irrigation, are great; and a force might be assembled there which could with ease posess itself of Teheran, in spite of any powers of resistance possemed by Persia. Theprovinceof Shemaki presents similar facilities for the acquisition of Ohian and Masenduan, the portions of Persia which sklrt the sonth-west and south margin of the Caspian; althoughthe intense heatof this region would render it impossible for au army to traverse it except in the earliest days of spring. As for Turkey, it is enough to tay that in 1855 General Williams at first expected the enemy to advance uponErzeroumbyBayazid and. Toprak Kaleh-that is, from the base of Erivan, instead of attacking Kars. The extreme importance of the provinces of Erivan and Shemaki for the purposes of menace is therefore obvious. But the centre of government is at Tiflis, the capital of Georgia; and throughTiflis, with a very inconsiderable exception, would have to pass all reinforcements and material of war required for operations on the frontier of the enemy. The security of Tiflis is consequently a necessary condition for the security of the whole of Transcaucasian Russia. And on what does this repose?t Colonel Jervis's map fuirnishes a ready answer. First and foremost, it rests on the power of keeping up a communication with the porth of Mingrella on the Black Sea. From Tiflis to Suram runs a military road on the north bank of the nver Koura for 88 miles; it continues fpr about 40 maore through the Imneratian hils, in a perfectly friendly territory to Eviriliska, and thence 106 more to St. bicholaia on the Black Sea,-a position which the Turks surprised at the first outbreak of the war. To Redoubt Kaleh the distance from Kwkiliskaja Is about the same; to Suchum Kaleb it is somewhat more, but not so much as to materially affect the facilities of communication; and it is obvious that to any of these points nothing was easier than to bring any amount of men or stores antecedently to the entry of the allied fleets into the Black Sea. When, however, this event took place the case was at once altered. As soon as it became evident that the command of the sea rested with the invaders the Russians dismantled all the forts (17 in number) between St. Nicholaia and Anapa, and renounced the hope of communicating with their Transcaucasian provinces by the route we have just indicated. But the only alternative was either to cross the great mountain barrier, the Caucasus, or to pass their supplies down the Wolga to strachan, and thence, by means of the Caspian, land them to the south of the mountain chain, and convey them by land to Tiflis, or direct to Erivan. The difflculties of either of these routes are enormous. The former, which runs through the celebrated pasa of Ddel, deserves a somewhat detailed description. Dariel (which is derived from two Tatar words signifying " narrow way") is an opening in the valley of the Terek-93 miles from Tfiand about half-a-dozen beyond the frontier of Georgia-on the northern slope of the Caucasian range. It is not more than 120 yards wide and on either side is bounded by steep and iofty hills, the bottom of which on the east side is washed by the river, here and for some distance below an impetuous and foaming torrent, frequently hurrying along large masses of rock in its course. " The roarng of ita waves is so loud," says a traveller, " that even at the distance of 20 paces from the bank it it impossible to understand what is said I by a person close to you, however he may exert himself." Sometimes in the summer its terrors are increased by avalanches which fall from the jMquinwai, the highest mountain of the snowy range, into one of its tributaries (the Zarchdar), wvhence masses of ice are rolled into the Terek, and dam up its current. In the year 1779 the inhabitants of a village no less than 120 feet above the bed of the Terek were compelled to leave their houses in consequence of the stream, thus obstructed, having risen to their leveL. A simiar circumstance happened in August, 1808. It gives a very unfavourable idea of the anount of geographical knowledge common in Englnd that, eduring the late war, one of the London morning papers should have most pretentiously urged the facilities which Russra possessed for reinforcing her forces " in the heart of Armenia" by means of a flotilla passing from the Caspian up this torrent. But the physical dangers of this pass form the oits dificulties. For 28 miles between onthe s (fortress of the Caucasus) andeea beg, onteGeorgian frontier, it passes through tribes of mountaineers, whose normal condition is that of deadly hostility to the Russians. Indeed, it is scarcely anL ex;aggeration to say that a consi- aeraule portion of the military posts on the Caucasian line are arranged solely with the purpose of keeping this part of the road safe. In the 28 miles' space Colonel Jervis's map exhibits six diiferent military posts, independently of Vladikaukas; and Vladikaukas itself is at the head of a triangle the two sides of which are formed by a similar cordon of positions, less thickly set, extending on the western side kvir about 70 and on the eastern for nearly 90 miles. The space included between these two sides and the base (which last is formed by the river Terek after it takes an easterly direction) is a desolate steppe, entirely without water, known by the name of the Little Kabarda on the maps, although the mountaineers have no special designation of it. At its western extremity stand Ekaterinograd, on the northern bank of the Malka, and Zartchnoi, on the southern, just at the point where the Terek joins its waters writh those of the former river and gives its own name to the united stream. Here the pssage of the mountains from the north is considered to begin. I MAp of the Frincipal 2MIia?

The nearest.point to which roops could be conveyed by water caraiige from European Russia is o^hrEak on the Don. Thence, for more than 100 vents, or 70 miles, they would have had to march through a. flat. rgig:op, which on the melting of the snw in spring is entirely overflowed, and on thesubsidenceof the water becomes little else than a dried-up muiaa. The extremely level character of the *round may be conceived from the fact that two pieces of paper dropped into one of the steppe stram near Jegorlitakaja on a perfectly calm day moved only twro feet in a quarter of an hoipr. few miles beyond this tpoint the lowwatershed is passed which divides the streams w;hich fall into the Azoff from those which empty themselves into the CaspDin. Sredno-Jegorlitzkcaja, the station on the middzeJegorlik (or, as it iS loctally called, Wonutachoi Jegorlitzkajs, the station on the stinking Jegorlik), is 13 verst beyond the wraterashed. It is the frontier station of the government of Stavropol, unhealthy to the lut dogrew, ard, as might be inferred from its popular narne, has scearly any water fit to drink. The nezt station Peshchta tuaja Kapani (sand-wells), whi4h appear in Colonel Jervis's map as Pestchairokops koe, bears a scarcely more auspicious name., and, ,j fact, until arrivingat Donakaja, which i 98m miles fromT cherkask, thec ou nta neertythe aane character. From Donskajato Ekateninograd no extraordinary difficulties in moving troops would be presented by the nature of the country, but the distance is 194 miles. The advantage to Ruffif, therefore, of access to Tifls by the coaxst of MingreUa, as compared with that by Tacberkaakr and the Pss of ])ariel, can scarcely be overrated. Eu he one case the dstance is only 234 miles, thron h a friendly country, amply supplied with provisons and water; in the other it is 476 miles:* of which nearly the first 100 are through a bsi;4 waste, and as many more through mountain inhabited by an inveterate enemy, to say notkiAw of the interruptions which the snows of winter and the floods of spring would occasion in the neighbourhood of the Azoff and on the Caucasian higb]ands Had the war lasted another year itis srcelr poble to doubt that Georgia, and with Georgia the whoe of Transcaucasian Russia, must inevitably have fahIn to the allies; and that, indeed, had circumstances permitted Oriar Pasha to invade Mingrelia a month earlier, even an additional year would not have been requisite to achieve that result. From Ksbeg (at the souhemn extremit- of the Pa¶s or lariel) to Tiflis is 64 mniles.
IRRTMATION WORKS rN INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF TE TUMES. Sir,-I have to thank you for the insertion in your valuable columns of my lst comraication-on a IbjeNoo Important to India as that to which it ltes. I therein assumed as a fact that the Indian Goverument cannot, at their own expense, curry out a system of works sufficient to meet the pre"inwants of the country in regard to irriA tion. That this 2 the cae few who know anything of will be prepared to dispute. The last financial statment of the Madras Government exhibits a deficiency of 500,0O0, including, however, an outlay, under the head of Public Works, of 710,000. It is manifest that such a condition of the finanoes of the Madras Preddency will not admit of any considerable portion of the revenue being approriated to, of cultural improvement. The otr presidenies, I beieve, have no surplus revenue. At lea4t, Bombay has not, and Bengal none that she can spare fo,r employment elsewhere. As mentioned in my former letter, the attempt to rae money on loan, even to the small extent of 3,000,0001. sterling, at 5 per cent. interest, tretena to prove abortive, from the want of confidenoe occasioned by the injudicious finandal measures of the Late supreme authorities, which fell with such calamitous effect upon the publio creditor. Money might no doubt be obtained at a higher rate of interest, but such , step would be attended with the greatest hardship, indeed utter ruin, to many of those wvho were inducee by misplaoed confidence in the candour and straightforward polki of the Government to invest *eir eapital in the then istng Four per Cent. Stoclk; and it reflects honour upon the Court of Directors thAt they have, if report speaks truly, given a decided veto to such a proposition. It 2s bmted in your money article of Testerdy that a report prevags of the posibility of an Indian loan being opened m the London market, but there ae difficulties il the way which render it Improbable that such a measure will be adopted. The prospect of the Government doing much, under the circumstances I have stated, is not very encouraging. That they wrll do what they can, with the limited means at their disposal, I make no question; but the issue involves more than a matter of mere perosnl convenience. The politi.l and moral progress of a territory (speaking of the Madra Presidency alone) three times the size of England, and of a population even more numerous, is at stake. The inreased production of those taple articles of commerce of which we in this country feel so much the necessity for the supply of our daily food and the support of our great m.nufaetures, rests in the balnce Surely, such momentous interests as these shall not be permitted to give place to unworthy jealousies, a stubborn adherence to antiquated systems, or a dislike of what is new and the well being and prosperity of one of our noblest an& richest posessions postponed or sacrificed to the exploded dogmas of monopoly or the no less hurtful influenoe of self. interest. There remains the alternative of clearing the way for the application of British capital in the execution of works to which so much value attaches, and I cannot think that either the enlightened philanthropist or politician will differ in opion, thu no minor considerations of terms or of detail should be suffered to interfere with a eonsummation go necessary and importaut. The Government may with great safety to themselves afford such conditions as will tisfy the British capitalis, and still leave themselves largely bene. fitted. If they refuse to do this-if at the same time they are unable to execute the works which justice claims at their hands, and which they damit the country requires, to what conclusion sbhll we come ? Certainly not that the time ha arrived of which, writing at the close of 1853, you thus so eloquently express yoursel-"We trust to see the day when wealthy England may at last prove a blessn to the immense and most interesting population which Providence has subjected to her rule, and the poor Eindoo mnay at Providence."ndaa isero It may not perhapg be generally known that during the last two years the Madras Govermment, in consequence of the sad tale of misery which the despair of long suffering on the part of the agricultural commumuty at last brought to lght, have tried the experiment of reduced taxation ozL the land. The result has proved that India offers no exoeption to aprinciplewhichhasworked sobeneficlrlly in this eountry. In the district of South Arcot a reduction of tax to the extent of 70,0001. has led to an additionAl cultivation of 178,000 aores and an increoaed collection of 68,0001. LL other provinces similar results have followed, and the aggregte returns from the 16 regular districts of the Madras Presidency show a total inerease of 160,000. in the landrevenue alone. These facts prove what many wdll-infremed men have questioned, but which has beon long too palpable to those whe have watched the agriculture of Southerm India-tbat the incubus which has overbornetho energies oF the poople lies in exacting from them more than they have beei able to earn by theirlabour. They evince ikewise the a predation on the part of the rTots of every opening to their advantage, and a determination to lose no time in availing themselves of any opportunity of improving their condition. If such beginninp have produced suih fruits, what may we not expect when water is supplled to the thirsty soil, and the great stimulant of nature is superadded to the active instrumentality of mau? It wll assuredly not be the fault of the ryot if any spot of ground remains untilled and unproductive. Rioe an syar ne cannot be cultivated without a plentiful supply of ter With water the wrowth of these n eses of life may be extended over the length and breadth of the country. So nearly balanoed have been the production and the consumption of the former from absenoe of irrigation, that a very small extra demand, such as has arisen from the dearness of food in Europe during the last few years, ha caused the value of rioe mn Madras to advance from 30 to 50 per cent., and obliged the more indigent but industrious classes in many districts to forsake their natural sustenanoe and have recourse to other and cheaper grains for their support. Trnly, when we think of what India is and what It nght be made to thc advanocment of itself and the benefit of the rmother country, and that the great panaea for al the distres an poverty which pervades the maes of its inhabitants, and for the difficulties which beset their path In tuning the soil undt their feet to profitable account, is water,-wa ter wrhich Pre videnee provides, but which man must appl,-surey,no longer shall the Government prove an obstruction, or private enterprise be wnting in pouring forth upon these nauD3 fertile regions the gret blesding of Irrigation.

SPAN- AND MExico,-The alleged. refusal of France and England to guarantee the security of Cuba, and to demand the neutrality of the United States in case of a 'war between Spain and Mexico, is said to be the reason why the former hesitates to despatch the hostile expedition to Vera Cruz, to insist on " solid satisfaction" for the outrages coummitted on some Spaniards by the lawless followers of Alvarez. Although a portion of the Spanish press stil continues to urge the necessity of punishing the Mlexicans, no matter what explanations the Mexican envoy maymnake, the belief is entertained in well-informed circles that, notwithstanding the manifestoes of the Spanish Government and the pompous preparationa for war which have been set on foot, the satisfaction and apology which Senor atafragua is instructed to make wiUl be accepted by Spain, and that there will be no war at all. Had the Western Powcr3 agreed to the Spanish propositions with regard to Cuba, it is very probable that Narvaez vwouild have gratified the popular hate of the Spaniards ansain8t the Mexicans, and that the threatened squadron would be now at Vera Cruz; but, as the Madrid correspondent of the London Ti'nes says, " It is this apprehbnsion (Cuba) that makes the Svanish Government very unwilling to go to war with Mexico, and they would unquestionably be glad if such satisfaction were offered as theycolddecentlyaccept." If Senor Lafragua disavow, as it is said he is instructed to do, any complicity on the part of his Govornment in the ontrages committed by the adherents of Alvarez ; if he give the assurance that the guilty parties sball be punished when they are arrested; and if he state the fact that the Mbexican Government are directly interested in the subjugation of Alvarez, this will be satisfaction which the haughty Castilian must " decently accept, without any sacrifice of duty or patriotism." Should the rumour be well founded that the Spanish Government wiU pursue a pacific course' -we think they have come to a wise and commnendable resolution, and one which will be satisfactory to all parties concerned, with the exception of the priests and General Santa Anna. The latter would naturally have preferred a de. claration of w&r,no matter what rnin and injury it entailed, so long as their selfish and ambitious designs were pro. moted. In fact, they are the only psarties who coiuld gain anytbing by war. The priests might punish Comonfort and his Government for breaking down their supremacy and confiscating their overgrown and ill-gotten wealth, and very poasibly might succeed in recovering both ; and Santa Anna, to whom exile and inaction are irksome, might re-establish bis hated rule in Mexico, and gratify his cupidity a:d Just for power; but what could Spain gain, materially or morally, beyond the temporary trimnph of a popular aniiooeity, at a cost which she can ill afford, while the consequences of war to Miexico would he ruiuous in the extreme? The idea of converting Mexico into a monarchy, wvith a Spanish Bourbon for Ring and Santa Anna for his al'er eyvo, may be recommended by the ex-Dictator as a stratsAe-t to attain his own object, by euili.ting Spanish pride is favour of his scheme, but it is hardly to he supposed that any sane person believes in the realization of such a projeet. It is reported that the Spanish Mini.%s*r at Wachington has informed the Government of the United States of the peaceful intentions of the Spanish Ministry, and of their resoluti-n not to send anLy expedition against Mexico if Senor Lafragna makes the reparation which President Comonfort is said to have instructed himi to offer. Betwveen this report and the hostile tone of the Mad rid journals, expressing the unappeasable indignation of the Spaniards of aUi perties against the 31exicans, there is an apparent coDidict, which way be accounted for by regarding tbe newspaper eutsisam as got up to order to serve a political purpneeat the electionra and to divert the attention - of the people from domnestic affairs.

LONDON, WEDNESDAY, APBrL 22, 1M7. The Irish Church Education Society is the small man of ordinary life, who is always at bis neighbours to do his small jobs. The persohage is one so comm.on that a touch or two wiU bring him painfully to every experience. He is always wanting you to sacrifice your principles, your independence, your tranquillity. your money, your time, everything that You value, for some little object of his own. If you have kept as clear a course as CQro the Yo3VNsn, you must move every Board and every Secretary for his brother or his son, all the time I that your own is starving. You must take up his ridiculou3 quarrels; you must join in his foolish crusade; you must write a hundred letters to people you never saw in your life for his protMg&, whom you also never saw-a candidate for some monster suburban asylum; you must introduce him to somebody you are shy of yourself; and bestow on his amiable but indolent and empty young friend the college scholarship you have sworn before Heaven to give to the best man. When you havo done all this, and lowered yourself as much in your own eyes as in the eyes of everybody about you, the " small man" rewards you as you richly deserve to be rewarded. He abuses you if you fall in his service, and despises you if you do not. Why should he not despise you, when you have done his dirty work for him ? CICXBo, doubtless, had such men in his eye when he said that people will do for their friends what they would never do for themselves. Our "small friend" across the Irish Channel, theIrish Church Education Society, is always wanting the nation at large to do for its particular sake what it has a hundred times most solemnly resolved to do on no account whatever. The British Legislature has sworn, as far as it can swear, not to lend a hand at proselytizing, not to confound politics with polemics, not to hound sect against sect, but to leave controversy as much as possible to its own natural course. The Irish Church Education Society woula be delighted to see more money, were it only for the principle of the thing, wrenched from the reluctant hand of the Papist peasant or labourer to make his children Protestants; it would rejoice to see the British Parliament torn to pieces, and whole Sessions wasted in fruitless discussions as to the rule of faith, the principle of education, and the sacred necessity of some imaginary rule which nobody, in fact, observes. The " small man" of the British community would thus become what he always is in his own eyes-the greatest. Every other question, every improvement, everything possible, would be cast aside and forgotten, simply to obtain notoriety, a stage, and a hearing for a quarrel quite certain to lead to no positive result, and to go off in present clamour and future heartburnings. The very statesmen entrapped into opening the floodgates of the controversy would be drowned in it, or carried a good way off their legs. But what of that? The worse for everybody else, the better for the " small " man," who rises only on the diminution of others, whose highest ambition it is to be the spark of a general explosion, and who has no other way of roasting his potatoes than by setting fire to his nei,ghbour's house. The Irish Church Education Society is not a "small man" in every respect. Indeed, in many respects its very greatness contributes to its essential smallness of spirit and demeanour. It has thebulk of the landowners and the whole of the Church Establishment on its side. Not that every Irish clergyman is on its side, but every sixpence of the Church revenues is kept for the maintenance of the Establisbed Church and its doctrines. It must therefore aU count on the side of the Irish Church Education Society. For many generations the Church has had every political, territorial, and other material aid that State, landlord, college, or clergyman could give, and the present stete of things, be it good or bad, is undeniably the result of that immense preponderance of secular advantages. Yet the Irish Church Education Society still continues its shrill, plaintive cry, for that which it has always enjoyed in such excess, and yet found so ineffective. The language of its noble, Parliamentary, legal, and clerical advocates at the annual meeting the other day, and of its report, is as whining and expostulatory as if, instead of being the wealthiest establishment, for its numbers, on the face of the earth, the Protestant clergy of Ireland had been for three hundred years a proscribed mountain sect, hunted like beasts, dwelling in caves, clothed in goatskins, and feeding on potatoes. They have to report and partially account for a continued decline of revenue and scholars. The figure which most distresses them is that which represents the number of Roman Catholic scholars, somewhat less than sixteen thousand, out of the whole eighty-five thousand. This brand plucked out of the burning they are very proud of when they contemplate " the unparalleled "exertions of the Papal Legate and the whole body "of the Romish hierarchy banded together against "them," as well as " the large amount of public "money for educational purposes placed at their disposal." Here, they say, " is the United "System of Education," so much prized and longed for by our rulers, and only to be found in these discarded schools. They are very right in making the most of these sixteen thousand, for they represent the whole present case of the Society. With the greater part of the soil of Ireland in their hands, with nearly al the Peerage and most of the Lower House, with the entire revenues of the Establishment, and, with a slight qualification, Trinity College in their hands, the Protestants of Ireland must be supposed fully able to take care of their own children. They have not a shadow of a case for one farthing of public money. The whole of the question relates to the Roman Catholic children whom they may induce to attend their schools. The number of these now amounts to 15,770. Their argument is, that if they get so many with so much polemical opposition and no public assistance, they would get many more with a little of the latter; and that the State is bound to give the latter, on its own principle of " United Education." This brings the whole of this interminable agitation to a very simple issue. Let oiur readers just imagine for themselves that amount of public money which, in addition to the immense public or private resources of the Irish Protestants, would raise the number of Roman Catholic children in the schools of the Irish Church Education Society from sixteen thousand to double that number, and they have the present question before them in an intelligible shape. We do not know what estimate other people would make, but, taking the model of corrupt borough contests, and the rapidly increasing scale of bribery when once it is known to be a question of money, we should think that in order to enable the Irish Church Education Society to get into its schools sixteen thousand more children it would require public assistance to the amount of a quarter of a milion of money. This estimate we are prepared to show reasons for, if necessary, but we should think it will recommend itself to anybody acquainted with the laws of political and controversial supply and demand. Such, then, is the modest application of our "small liiend" the IrishChurch Education Society. It is that-Lord PALMERSTON, or the Premier for the time being, a man at the mercy of Parliamentary maajorities, called to account for every sixpence of public money, and charged with the difficult task of concentrating the time and labour of the Session and the interest of the publio at large on certain measures of general utility, is to throw everything into confusion and bring this empire to the vorde 'df chaos by giving the weal6h,' Church Establish~auent of irelaud a quarter of 'A million, more or les,-1eas certainly would not do it-to enable it to proselytize sixteen thousand children of Roman Catholic parents. Familiar as we are with the applications of small men-of the clasw that is always asking one to sell one's soul to get somebody else 501. &-year-we neverthelem give the palm of surpassing impudence to the demand of the Irish Church Eiducation Society. In no other case that we can call to mind is the result sO utterly disproportionate to the cost; in no other is the gain so inconsiderable, not to say questionable, and the sacrifice of money, principle, and peace sO immense. It would be more than immense, for it would be infinite. Once recognized and assisted by the State as a proselytizing Church, once able to boast of its thirty-two thousana Roman Catholic scholars, once figuring in our Edaucation Estimates at its 250,OOOZ.,-we repeat, not a farthing less woould do it,-aU Ireland would be hurled back down the precipice up which it has just painfully climbed into that pit of anarchy from which we hoped it had finally escaped. Chronic rebellion, thirty thousand soldiers, monster meetings, primdial agitations, conspiracies, altar denunciations, and a perfect torrent of abuse against the whole English race from everY pulpit, every platform, and every press in Ireland, eagerly caught up by our continental rivals and loudly echoed from across the Atlantic, would be the sure result of the policy urged, as a matter of conscience, by the Irish Church Education Society. How it would all end we fear even to conjecture. The return of a fever is always worse than the first attack. We know what the first attack of Irish agitation has been, and have no wish to rnm the risk of a second.
The British people, with a great proportion of the numbers, intellect, and worth of the IJnited States, have had to confess to much despondency lately on the subject of Slavery in the New World. We of this generation have been brought up in the creed of unceasing, undeviating progress, and are apt to feel astonishment and anger, if not depression, if each year does not exhibit some advance on the last. The abolition of Negro Slavery al over the civilized world has been thought to be merely a question of time. CxLAisox and WILmSFoncnV slew the monster among ourselves, and one of the few redeeming acts of the short-lived French Republic was to emancipate the slaves of Martinique and Guadaloupe. For years the Abolitionists have been at work in the States themselves, preaching, haranguing, and writing, with an enthusiasm which has neverfailed. Mrs. STOWn!S book made the tour of the world in a few months, and there is hardly a speech or language in which that voice of pleading for human rights has not been heard. So we in England, and a great number of those who agree with us in the New World, began to think that the long-expected time, if not at hand, mnust yet be within the range of vision. With the wholeworld arrayed in condemnation of the principle of Slavery, surely the slaveowner would be driven from his old position and his traditional arguments. It was thought the natural inferiority of the black race, the convincing argument from final causes--namely, that negroes existed on one side of the Atlantic, and good fields for cotton-planting and cane-growing on the other, the Scriptural reasoning about Loes bond servants and PnLmxxoNes runaway slave ON'SrnS, were pretty well given up, and that the Southerners would confine themselves to their one valid argument-that Slavery exists, and that it is next to impossible to get rid of it. But the philanthropists have been too sanguine in their anticipations. Whether from the violence or indiscretion of the Abolitionists, or from the magnitude of the interests connected with Slavery, or from the deep antipathy which the white Amencan feels towards every man of colour, a decisive vote of the whole nation has upheld the supremacy of the slaveowners, and confirmed their proceedings in the Far West. Contemporaneously with this great political judgment we have had the principle of Slavery asserted as essentially and universally true by more than one Southern organ, and now a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States proclaims that by the Constitution no man of colour can have the rights of citizenship. As far, then, as the politician and legislator can effect it, the cause of the negro has retrograded within the last few years. Never was there a time when the public opinion of the American people, deliberately expressed, had more completely condemned the African race to servitude, and declared the enforcing of labour to be a legitimate means of bringing into cultivation their great continent. But great natural laws make themselves felt through all the turmoil of political strife, and in spite of al the resolutions of national prejudice. The Americans have said that all men are free and equal,-meaning thereby that liberty of action and equality of rights, though not of conditions, were a necessity of a properly constituted society. This great principle seems destined to assert itself against any legislative enactments and any judicial decisions which may seem to controvert it. Americans decide that Slavery may be introduced into any part of their country,-a law. stronger than themselves proclaims that Slavery shall, in spite of temporary successes, recede before the advancing tide of freedom. Slavery treads out the compromise line, and declares that it will range anywhere from the Mexican Gulf to the British frontier. Nature, working quietly but irresistibly, proves that Slavery is essentially weak, and not only has no power to conquer what it covets, but is even incapable of holding its own. At this very time, when Southerners are all powerful in the Cabinet and in Congress. we learn that the State of Virginia, " the Old Dominion," the land of aristocratic slaveowning gentlemen, is threatened with an invasion of free settlers. The case is as follows :_Virginia, and particularly its eastern districts, have been under cultivation now for nearly three hundred years. The culture of tobacco, which exhausts the land, has been carried on by means of slave labour. The process became a losing one in many places as soon as steamboats and railways opened richer and newer regions to the planter. Consequently the enterprise of Virginia of late years has been directed to the pursuit of breeding slaves for Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and the other cottongrowing, States. Whole tracts have gone out of cultivation. Population has increased slowly, wlhile the Union has been rapidly advancing in the path of greatness. Virginia sent 23 members to Congress in 1830; she sends only 13 now. Her ancient families are getting poor. We are told that " Debt, debt ! Taxes ! taxes!" represent her present condition. Newspapers dilate on the wasting away of "the Old Dominion," its worn-out soil, 'vergrown fields, sedge patches, briar patches, Stationary population, and waning influence. Whole districts have in fact returned to a state of nature. In these circumstances it is not unnatiural that free enterprise should be directed to the old State. Why should the sturdy settler go fifteen hundred miles inland, when on the shores of the Atlantic there are thousands of square miles which wait for his axe and plough ? Already a considerable number of Yankees and New Yorkers have gone South, and now there seems to be a scheme for repopulating the State by an organized immigration. A Mr. Em THAYsa, ;of Massachusetts, has founded the " North "Amerincan Homestead Company." The shareholders ate to double their money by " the "friendly invasion of ' the Old Dominion' by a "renovating army of free white labour." A letter from this gentleman, though ultra-American in style, is sensible enough. Land in the exhausted counties cat be had for from three to five dollars the acre. This, by planting white colonies on it, can be made valuable, and the proximity of the settlement to the more populous parts of the Union will insure a fair supply of farmers. " Kentdck-y and Maryland," says Mr. TAYEin, "are already.looking with envy on the "sublime destiny of Virginia, and are inviting the "same invigorating agency of free labour to their "own borders." " Millions of acres of Virginia "land," we are told, " owned by the merchants "f and brokers of New York and. Philadelphia, will "be made available at a profit to the present ovners, who have heretofore despaired of selling it at any price." We are bound to say, however, that "the Old "Dominion!' is not unanimous in welcoming the "invasion." The ultra-Slavery press of the State is particularly warlike. " This enterprise," says a Richmond paper, "is a piratical expedition "against the peace, security, and welfare of the commonwealth." " It is a crusade against "Slavery-a propagation of Black Republicanism." If the settlement be permitted, Slavery will soon be thrown on its defence instead of being a triumphant and aggreosive power. Therefore " duty to ourselvez and also to our sister States "of the South demands that these Yaniee "immigrants under Er.r THAYER be repulsed "from the soil of Virginia. No nice techni- cality of legal form can fetter a people in "protecting their essential interests." These expressions show pretty plainly the feeling of a section with regard to the intended enterprise. But we attach little importance to such menaces. The settlers will, of course, be only exercising an undeniable right in buying a piece of ground and planting it, and the advantage to all concerned will be too plain for any act of violence to be tolerated. We may, therefore, trust to see free labour advance by its own inherent energies into regions where Slavery has had its day and failed. The principle has now been defnitively adopted, that every part of the Republic shall be opened either to the one or the other, according as the majority may determine. If the Freesoilers take their opponents at their word we have little doubt of the result. Az New York made itslf free of Slavery within the memory of men stil living, and New Jersey within the last few years, so we trust the North wil gradually push its principles in company with the progress of its hardy and adventurous sons.
The public and our military authorities are now engaged in a dispute in which each is taking the side which we should expect the other to take. The public is pushing professional Education on the Army, and the Army is throwing it off, or, at any rate, acquiescing very slowly in the necessity. This is not what we should have expected beforehand. The proverb says, "Nothing like leather." A Board of military authorities ought, according to all precedent, to be pedantically absorbed in the importance of the military art, and rigid in their magisterial claims upon the junior members of the service. But what is the fact? Why, the new scheme of Staff Education is a very grudging response to the public demand. The Horse Guards is not committed to anything more than that the old basis of appointments going on, the young men shal be required to have a smattering of the rudiments of the military art, and " a colloquial use" of one foreign language. The plain English of this is, that the Horse Guards does not want to make the Army " professio,4." There is an old tradition against it, and they will give in as little as they can. We are not to think that the Army is a profession -no, it is above such a sordid standard;-it is an order, a rank, a nobility-it is not a profession. And this is practically the idea of a great many who have nothing to do with the Horse Guards. We doubt even whether the public itself, with all the cry there is for Military Education, would quite like a professional army, such as the French have. No, there is great outcry when blunders are made, and we hear on all sides the complaint that our officers really know about as much of the art of war as they know about alebymy. But the favourite and popular image of the " dashing" young officer has not very deep ?cientific associations connected with it. The knowledge of the pocket sextant, tactics, field movements, and fortifications, does not enter much into that lively portrait of a man elegantly caricoling on a caparisoned charger on a fine summer day, his arms shining in the sun, and his feather nodding in the wind. The figure which is thus seen sparkling in the sunshine is known to be equaUy important and transcendant in another sphere-the ballroom. He is there seen in less overpowering but more refined majesty, looking liL-e a condescending divinity, and engaged in the pastime of fascinating young ladies. A whole world of 19th century sentiment and romance surrounds him, and a thousand novels every year sustain and enliven the representation. There is very little of the scientific element in such a picture as this, yet it is a favourite popular image; it captivates alike our ballrooms and, our mobs. The ghost of old Marechal VAUBAN may frown and mutter in a corner of the scene, and pronounce the splendid young gentleman a young idiot ; but his criticism is not heard. We may add that the professional standard is not much liked in this country in any department. There is a general feeling against it. Your lawyer is a divine, and your divine a lawyer. The squire guards the Protestantism of the parish, while the clergyman diligently attends the Board of Guardians. Our two rival Chancellors of the Exclhequer are both scholars besides being financiers. Sir GEORGE COINEWAJLL LEwIS translates Mller, and Mr. GLADSTONE elucidates Wcwkmnuth, and buries himself in Homeric scholia. Everybody, whatever he is, is glad to show that he is not that, but something else. Beware of insulting him by supposing that he possesses more than an average knowledge of his peculiar department. He will not let himself be treated as an appendage to a profession. He is external to it in his own eyes, and always has some centre or other to which he attaches himself wholly outside of his professed vocation, and which he generally selects on account of its remarkably wide distance from it. Wle will not, however, do the public the injustice to suppose that it is obstinately wedded to this poetical image of the young officer, or that, upon mature consideration, and after recent experience, it will go on thinking that sergeants alone ought to know anything of the art of war. All we mean to say is, that we do not think the public is prepared altogether for a professional standard in the Army. A French cavalry oflicer looks as if he never was out of his regimentals-they clothe him less like a garment than like another body. 'We naturally ask ourselves whether he was born in them, and we half doubt what we should com e to if we denuded the figure of what looks so verv like its skin. This is not to the taste of English people; they like to see regimentals worn as if they were sometimes taken off, and as if there really was a man underneath them who was gailty of occasional digressions to the civilian coetunte. And, therefore, when the question of an improvementin our Milita-y Erhi+cation is discuised caro ou'ht to be taken not to carry the profemimnal standard too far, or adopt it as the- sole--is for such an improvement. We agree in the main with the remarks - of Dr. YAVJuGHAx,- of Harrowr, on this subject, giren iin a mo; column. He protests against beginning # profesional education of the officer too so* and depriving him of the benefit of a sound pra nary gen6ral education. He is for keepin$ him4 the public school, and only vaying in one special points his plan of inctraction from | ordinary instruction of the school, and thenlett him go to Sandhurst or elsewhere for special traiu ing. This appear sensible. It wouId doubt* be a great error to educate the English ofib without a decided reference to his future pltoe~ a ISoglish ociety, and, if he is to have a]11g plaee in ociety and keep it, he must have a good general education. We must not jiR in a hurry, then, to begin his rpecial training; ^ l is not to be an offioer only, but a membeir' soeciety and with general intelligence and atu4 of mind, and he must even be this in order to be* good officer. Depend upon it, there will be ui6 real waste in giving him time for a good genbQ education.

Prince Albert rode on horseback with the Prinoe -Of Wales and the Princess Royal. The Hon. Beatrioe Bydg and Captain Du Plat were in attendance. The Prinoe went to the British Museum in the afternooz, attended by his Equerry in Waiting, and also paid a viit to the Duchess of Glocester. The Princess Royal and the Princess Alice. attended by Lady Caroline Barrington and the Dean of Windsor, 'went to Lambeth Palace in the afternoon. TheMarchioness of Ely has suocewded the Duches of Welington as the Lady in Waiting to Her Majesty. The non. Mortimer Sackvllle West has relieved Colonel the Hon. A. N.

HerRoyal Highness is in a precarious state. Their Royal Highnesses Prince Albert and the Duke of Cambridge and her Serene Highness the Prinoess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg visited the Royal Duchess at Glocester-house, Park.lane. The Hereditary Grand Duchess of Meoklenburgh-Strelit, accompanied by her son, Prince Adolphus, arrived in London yesterday morning from the continent. Her Royal Highness went to the residence of the Duchess of Cambridge in St. James's Palace, and dined with her brother, the Duke of Cambridge, in the evening. The Hereditary Grand Duchess afterwards left town for the reside&ce of the Duchess of Cambridge at Kew.
ERR MAJE2S'S WHEATI. Although sprious approbation is often more vociferous n its expression than honest satisfaction, a person habit. uated to theatrical audiences has seldom much difficulty in dist-uguishing the real article from the counterfeit. Any one can be noisy who is blessed with strong lungs or a hard pair of hands, but spontaneity defies imitation. Now, the greeting with which Mademoisele Piccolomini was received when last night she made her dibut for the season wa spontaneous in the hightest degree. There could be no doubt that the occupants of the stalls were heartily delighted to see the "pet" of last season, aod no doubt that the operatic favourite was equally glad to see themm. It was a happy meeting on both sides. With pleased couwr tenance and nimble step did the little artist trip along the 3 mountain path and descend to the footlights, and vith a sort of laughing enthusiasm did her old friends, who had anxiously waited for her appearance, hail the moment at which it actuaUy took place. Where mere admiration is kindled a wvelcome may be most serious in its expression, but there is generally something mirthful in populariy, provided the circumstances under which it is manifestod are not of a decidedly tragic nature. Accoutred as the merry tirandiWre-tbe " Figlia del Reggimento'the object of applause could be aU smiles, and her hilarity was reflected in the countenance of every spectator. She was evidently popular. The manner in which Mademoiselle Piecolomini identifies herself with the spoilt child of the " Undecimo"-the con. fident toss of the head-the dubious gravity of the march, which leaves the question undecided whether the young lady supposes that she is performing a military duty, or merely indulging in a congenial freak,are already famriliar to all who studied her peculiarities last year. Bet, although the general conception remains the same, there seemed last night a greater precision of detail than on former occasions. Scarcely a line was without its distinct meaning. Her opening conversation with the paternal Sergeant Sulphizio was conducted in an orderly business-like manner, and as she enumerated her martial vrtues it wvas wvith the air of a complacent self-approval that likewise expects acknowledgment from without. But the claim has been acknowvledged:- "Po01 er rdar sglo del selo talento " 4 vot unAninit il reguisento Sta vmandiera mt homino." She utters these words with all solemnity. To other folk& the office of vivandifre may not appear pre-eminent among earthly dignities, but to lIaria herself it is a post of high honour, not to be mentioned in terms of levity. Sbe is firmly convinced that her excessive merit has met its fitting reward. In the famous song " Ciascun lo dice," sung in the presence of the admiring soldiers, M aemoisell Piccolomini takes care to show that Maria's belief in the absolute perfection of her particular regimentis altogether genuine and unsophLsticate& She laughs with the men individually, because they are familiar friends, but for the coUective body her veneration is intense. The words of the song describe an ideal regiment, snch as the imagination could not exceed, but to showi that she aludes to no shadowy creation of the fancy .she points% fo the mortal heroes ranged in the back-gronud-" BEli d a, I" The love scene with Tonio is one of the prettiest things conceivable. She is half inclined to tenze the poor feUow, but in the midst of her prudery sbe throws such a tone of endearment into the sl words " d nia ura rag Z7, - *- 3 el ieo Si tinu cars allor ia vita "Ha bon oap to? And the coaxing attitude is so completely in accordanen with the tone that all futrther attempt at dissimulation is wseless, and off she ru-bes into the np ssioned ardour of the cabba.let It is a sad oiatter to have all this happiness broken up by the discovery of an aristocratic relative, who will not allow one to pursue one's favourite amusements, and with mosttruthful pathos does Mademoiselle Piocolo-. mini denote the distress of Mar a at parting from the brave old friends of ber youith. Sorrow breathes through every note of the beautiful air "Convien partir." It is no sentimental grief that she feels, but the downright misery of a child, which. transient though it be, cani only express itself in a hearty fit of crying. Hence every one is delghted in the second act, when, flinging down the hateful song, and renouncing all allegiance to stiU more hateful etiquette, sbe once more becomes the happy Mari% of the early scenes. Signor Belletti appeared for the fir-t time this season in the character of S'ilpizio, and sang in his us.ual artistioal manner. Signor Steechi Bottardi, who inade his d,'but M Tonio, sought to enidow the part with more than ordinary comicality, hat. no great result was achieved either by his humour or his sentiment. At the fall of the cuirtain applause broke forth in every variety of form and with every symptom of Jseartimnss, the trinmph-nt little heroine of the evening exeiting new aceclanations every tinie she re-appeared tucoll ct th. bouquets flung at her feet from all parts of tbe hous6.

FOREIGN IN.TBLIGBNoE. - FRANCE. 4& JA portion of the following sppealed In our second odiMOon of v q 9 -. (nO1M OUB OWN COBPlESPOND=T.) PARIS, APRIL 20, 6 P.3. 'The Neuchatel Conference met to-day, and went through the important operation of reading the project of arrangement between Switzerland and zrusia. It is for M. de HIatzfeldt and Dr. Kern to accept, or leave; and I suppose the Plenipotentiaries will not be sorry to get rid of the affair. The numerous official relations which Feruk :Ihan, the Persian Ambassador, has formed since his arrival in Europe will detain him in Paris until &September next, when he hopes to return to Persia. it is stated that the Commissioniers appointed by the Emperor to report on the expediency of removng the convicts from Guiana to New Caledonia Save recommended the smaaU Island of Pines for the seat of the new penal settlement. It is one of the same group, and is said to be remarkable for the salubrity of its climate. A letter from Algiers of the I5th states that the 1st Regiment of Zouaves has established itb camp at Tii-Ouzon, at the gates, as it were, of Kabylia. Tizi-Ouzoni forms, with Dra-el-Mizan, the two advanced posts which the Governor-General caused to be established last year. It is from that point that the columns will commence their march to penetrate into the enemy's counitry, and it is there also that the magazines have been established for the arny. The sale of M. Patureau's galery of paintingas commenced to-day in the large room of the Sale ides Ventes, Rue Drouot. It was attended by almost all the amateurs in Paris and by a number of artista. The room and the lobby adjoining were crowded to excess. Each lot was warmly contested, and the prices obtained are considered exorbitant. She Emperor, who last week visited the collection, declared that some of the paintings should not leave the country, but be purchased for the Louvre. The Sleep of the Infant Jesus," by Murillo, wan 'urchased for the Empress at 41,500f. Trade was particularly dull with the Paris shop. 'keepers for the first four days of last week. The weather was wet and windy, and there was little inducement to quit the house. Since Thursday, however, there has been a great change, the weather has become dry and warm, the streets are crowded, and everybody appears anxious to cast off his winter clothing. The retail dealer are in hopes of indemmifying.themselve3 during the next month for the 6e dead~ saeason. The manufacturers have received some large orders from Germany and Russia during the last few days, but not so many as at the same season last year. The stock of French goods in Russia last year was small, as the war interrupted the commercial relations between the two countries, and there was consequently a brisk demand for French manufactures; but the importations of last year are not yet disposed of, and the demand this year is less animated. The taste for French produce is, however, becoming more general among the wealthy classes in Russia, and the Paris manufacturers appear to be still confident that their exports to the Russian ports this year will equal if not exceed in amount those of last year. The accounts from the French manufacturing districts are not satisfactory. The Lyons silk weavers complain that they are this year deserted by their American customers. Letters from New York mention that the slhopkeepers in that city are sufficiently supplied with silk goods, and that they will purehase as little as possible until July next, when the new tariff will come into operation. The Paris manufacturers are suffering from the same cause. Letters from Rouen state that there is little business doing there in any branch of manufactures. The conseq1uence is that the mill-cwners are working only four days in the week. Some sales had taken place at Mulhouse of white cottons, but at very low prices. The woollen manufacturers have but a small stock of the xaw material on hand, and prices are rising. Colonial produce, especially sugar, continues to -rise. while the distillation from beetroot, to supply the deficiency of alcohol occasioned by the vine disease, considerably diminishes the home production. There is very little business doing either in the Paris corn-market or in those of the departments. Prices remain the same as last week, except at Bordeaux and Toulouse, where a considerable fall -is announced. At the last Paris market flour of the best quiiality was more sought for than during the previous week. Prices were more firm and sales were effected at 73f., ,3f. 50c., and 74f. the sack of 357 kilogrammes. The bakers, who have for a long time limited their purchases, are now forced to Tenew their stocks. The millers grind but little and mainitain their price. The supply in the stores has diminished by 2,000 metrical quintals during tie last week, but no uneasiness is excited by the present firmnness of the market, as it has hepii officially ascertained that there is more wheat in France than is sufficient to supply the consumption nntil the next harvest. The growing crops, nioreover, present a most favourable appearance throughout the country. The price of butchers' meat increases every week. The best ox-beef, which was to be had a few years since at 16 sous the pound, is Dow 21 sous, and, if we are to believe the butchers, we shall have to pay much higher prices before long. The consumption of wine, which was much reduced in Paris during the last two years, has now considerably increased, and business is brisk at the wine market of Bercy. Prices are firm, without much variation. Spirits distilled from bestroot fell last week from 128f. to 125f. the hectolitre. The c)nceasion of the railway from Rustchuk to 'arna has been granted to some Bulgarian merchants. Intelligence from Smyrna states that Admiral Lyons and his squadron had been received there with great honour by the Turkish auithorities and the French naval divi-sion. Admiral Bouet-Willaimez, at a grand fete which lie gave to the English officers on board the Pomoile, proposed a toast in honour of the English and French flags. The English Admiral replied at -some len-:th, dwelling on the advantages which must result, he dleclared, from the Anglo-rench alliance. Admiral Lyons in the evening of the same day returned the fete, and made another speech, in which lie enumerated the results obtained in the late war in the East by the co-operation of the brave allies who had Fought by the side of England. According to the last advices from the Danubian provinces, WaaUachia is ra her agitated, but Moldavia tranquil. The price of corn at Constantinople, Varna, and iBourgas had faUen.

(FRtOMi OUn OWNM COItaESPONDENT.) VIENNA, ALPnL 18. The HIIigarian Conservative party, which is almost exclusively composed of men of the *highest rank, intends to present a memoir to the Emperor wfhile he is in Hngary. The magnates qof the kingdom wrhich St. Stephen founded eight centuries, ago lament over the loas of their aneient privileges, and it is, their intention to petition for some political concessions. They desire improve-ment in the administration, an efficient representation of the country, and a provincial government 'which, uip to a certain poiut, shall be independeut fof the Ministerial departments. As you have already been informed, no concessions are likely t o .be made which are not in strict keeping with the ,established principle, that Hungary is an integral part of the united and indivisible Empire of Austri;a, and it is no longer ago than yesterday that the Emperor spoke in the same sense. It is said that the Minister of the Interior will acoompary their Mlajesties to Hungary but it is 'by nto means probable that sch viill be tie case. Th0 fact is, that Baron Bach is nof in favour with the Magyars, anid his presence at the side of his Imperial Master would not fail to produce a chilling effect on then. In order that neither the nobles nor the comntmnities may be put to unnecessary expense, the Imperial kit<hen will supply everything that is requisite for the table of their Majesties during their sojoury, ir, Hungary. The only private persons who will be honioured with a visit are the Archbishop of (Gran, the Duke of Coburg, and the Princes Esterhazy and Batthyany. Prince Esterhazy is making extensive preparations for the reception of their Maj sties at Eisenstadt, where he has a splendid estahbllhhment. His Highness has a bodyguard and a private band at E1isenstadt, but he cannot boast of having a " Kapellmeister " like the one his ancestor had in 1.760.* The papers state that the statutes for the representation of the different provinces and the municipal laws will very 5oon be published, but they ait in error. The statutes for the repiresentation of Hungary will, perhaps, be made public while the Emperor is in that country, but there is every reason to believe that the finishing touch has not yet been put to them. As to the propewed municipal laws, they have been changed at I*ast half-a-dozen times, and it is a positive fact that they are not yet to the taste of the Council of Ihe Empire. As each province or Crown land will have a separate and somewhat different " statute of representation," so will it have a separate and somewhat different municipal law. A few days since a new census law was published. Formerly the census was taken in such a Aay that the authorities knew where to find the men who were of an age to shoulder the musket, but nothing more. The census wll now be taken every six years-except in the military frontier districts-in the following manner: -1. The number of cities, towns, villages, hamlets, and houses will be registered. 2. The number of inhabitants, according to their religion. 3. The number according to their professions or trades. 4. The number according to their age. 5. The number married or sinigle. 6. The number according to their residence. it the same time statiBtical information must be given relative to the number of animals kept. The animals which must be entered in the tables are stallions, mares, geldings, foals, mules, asses, bulls, cows, oxen, calves, sheep, goats, and swine. Such terrorism prevails in Bucharest that a nonmuionist cannot venture to give expression to his opinions. The political feverin Jassy has greatly subsided, and it is worthy of remark that almost all the foreigners residinjg in the Danubian Principalities are of opinion that their union would be a death-blow to Moldavia and to the Porte. The Russian railroads are systematically " puffed " by some of the German papers, but the public declines to have anything to do with them. The Austrian press still eulogizes the Suez Canal project, but no longer with such a hearty goodwill as it did a few months ago, when there was a prospect of the shares being at a premium. Onthe 15th, the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian inspected tbe Novara and Caroline, which are lying in the Bay of Muuggia. His Imperial Highness addressed the members of the expedition, and begged of them not to lose sight of the fact that the Austrian Government had a double object in view: -the improvement of the Imperial navy, and the furtherance of science. On the 15th a new sloop of 28 gUns was launched at Venice, and it is expected that four others will be off the stocks before the year is at an end. At noon to-morrow, the 19th, the Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom will mak-e his solemn entry into Milan. The Austrian Lloyd has received a clipper steamer from England, which moves at the rate of 14 miles an hour. The vessel, which is the 68th of the Lloyd steamers, is called "the Trebizonde." The Chevalier von Wildechgo, who was the chief of a section in the Finance Department, has been made a Councillor of the Empire instead of Count Zichy. PRUSSIA. (FsOM OUR OWN cORRESPONDENT.) BERLIT, APRIL 18. According to an offlcieux article in the Zeit, this Government has caused its diplomatic representative at NWashington to remonstrate with the United States' Government, on account of the many acts of violence committed on immigrants in American ports, by forcibly pressing, or with artifice kidnapping, them on board American vessels, and thus securing their compulsory service on board American merchantmen. These steps at Washington have been mainly founded on a report published by the Liverpool Society for the Protection of Fsoreigners, which shows, among other things, that during the past year and the first month of this year 69 cases had come to the knowledge of the society of foreigners who had been compelled against their wills to serve on board American merchantmen, and who, on arriving in Liverpool, were so perfectly ruined in health and fortune as to become entirely dependent upon charity and hospital aid. Of 37 others who had been talked over into taking Amnerican service voluntarily, a further number of 13 had been obliged to have recourse to surgical aid on reaching Liverpool, in consequence of maltreatment, and out of a total number of 106 cases that had come to the knowledge of the society, only two persons were found who did not complain bitterly of the illusage received on board American vessels. The grievous malpractices in New York also to vhich immigrants are exposed from the artifices of ".runners," who hoax the ignorant stranger inito delusive purchases and expensive routes to their destination, have been repeatedly and indostriously exposed by the Government here, through the agency of an Emigration Board for the information of intending emigrants; and the sale of through tickets to American ports has been strictly forbidden in the Prussian doininions, an example which has been followed by the Hamburg and Bremen authorities. On the other hand, this government has at various times pointed out, even by its official organs, the superior advantages avaitingtheemigrant inAustraliaand Canada, where, whatever the emigrant's individual success in life may be, he enjoys the advantage of British laws and the regulated freedom obtainable under a monarchical government. It only remains for the local Government and railway authorities in Canada to show the world good evidence of their really providing well for the despatch of the immigrant to his destination, and his protection there, to obtain a considerable amount of cointenance willingly accorded to them by the authorities here. The Prince of Prussia has left Coblentz for Mayence, of which federal fortress he is Governor. After residing there tillthe2lst inst. he will proceed thence to Frankfort, and, accompanied by the Princess, pay a visit to their daughter at Carlsruhe. The whole of May the Prince and Princess will probably spend here in Berlin, at which time the spring exercises of the troops take place, and towards the beginning of June they will proceed to London on a visit to Queen Victoria, accompanied by Prince Friedrich Wilhelm. It is very probable that the bill for raising the price of salt, which is a State monopoly here, wiUl even at this late stage be withdrawn by the (Govern- ment. It stands a very fair chance of being thrown out in the Hoise of Notables, and rather than be exposed to this check, after having had their bill for imposing a tax upon houses thrown out in the House of Deputies, they will probably withdraw the obnoxious bill, and thus prevent the H[ouse making itself popular at their expense. The measure has at all times been unpalatable to the King, for not only does it disproportionately increase the burdens of the poor rather than the rich, but it is to a certain extent a breach of an implied undertaking, made when the tax was reduced some years back, that it should never be raised again. Several portions of the loaves of bread which gave rise to such strong suspicions of poisoning at Hongkong have been forwarded to Baron T%iebig, at Munich, for analysis. From the circ-Aistance that such a distant auithority in chymis.f" has been sought out, one so perfectly aloof froidall local and political sympathies and antipathiA, one may conchlide that it is the friends of A' m who are desirous of corroborating the verdi.-of the English jury at the hands of the Germa alyst. itTSSIA. (mRo-& OUP. BERLIN CORUPO DONT.) BERLIN, Apsm 19, If one mi<nt venture to form an idea of public opinion it; St. Petersburg fom casual expre6sions let fal)*incidentally to gther subjects in tha press, onepfould be led to cnclude that tha Qdiwed "' In the year mttibWg w a the.Jdof %iho $sterhaby's "ohapeL"' portion of the public, who have wome idea of what is passing in Europe and the entire non-Russian world, is beginning, now that the very smncere satisfaction atthe return of peace has had time to lose somewhat of its intensity, to feel that that peace has been purchased at a very heavy sacrifice of prestige, and to entertain a very strong desire, if possible, to recover some portion of the halo that once surrounded the Russian name. The late war is already too far past for them to reflect whether Russia -was in a position to prolong the conflict in the hopes of regaining her lost ground. In all manifestations of opinion, however, where Government influence prevails, or where a knowledge of Government principles and professions exists, we find nothing but self-gratulation at Russia having been compelled, though by a bitter lesson,togiveuptbefalse and delusivepolicyofaggression, and direct her energies towards internal comolidation and improvement. However jealously and suspiciously the rest of Europe is bound to watch the conduct of Russia, it must be admitted that as yet no indication has become patent of any other intention being entertained hy her present Ruler and his administration than to give an Easternly direc. tion to the expansive and absorbing tendencies of the empire, while striving to attain solidity and improved internal resources by more facile intercourse with the West. TheclassofmindswhichIfirstdescribed as having already forgotten the sacrifices and privations imposed on the country by the war, and who now dwell exclusively on the sacrifices the peace has cost, find willing allies in that tolerably numerous class of blind enthusiasts who were always for continuing the war and deprecated all approaches to peace. The freedom, however, that is now accorded to the expression of personal sentiments in private prevents these two species of discontent from attaining anything like dangerous dimensions; and while, on the one hand, the reforms so assiduously pursued by the Government tend to occupy to a great extent the minds of the former class, those of the latter find an ample opening for their energies jn the operations in the Caucasus and the organization goint on in Siberia. What information reaches us of these plans there is very scanty, and our knowledge of those regions is so very much more so that we can hardly apprehend and digest what does come to us; but, from all that one reads and hears of what is going on there, one is perfectly ready to believe that Russia will, very shortly, be in a position to exercise fully as great a pressure on China from the land side as the maritine nations can already from the seaboard. I believe I have already pointed out that there is a great tendency in the Russian press to apply to China the picture of " L'homme gravement malade," which formerly was given out as the portrait of the Turk. A dictum of the Northern Bee, a few days ago, with regard to England does not evidence the same amount of perspicacity and correctness of view. With reference to the result of the recent elections it says:- * "This passing over of Cobden, Bright, and others in the elections shows us how powerful the hostility against Russia still is in England; they std make Cobden feel the consequences of his opposition to the war now ended, and that too after the lapse of so long a time. That must be a nice sort of a peace that we have with England, when public opinion, which influences everything there, cnmnot even yet pacify itself," &O. The celebrated writer on political economy and statistics, M. Tengoboraki, died at St. Petersburg on the 11th inst., within a very few days after his return from Copenhagen, where he had been engaged in connexion with the treaty for the redemption of the Sound Dues. The Jouwncs de St. Petersbourg thus aunounces his decease in the number which has arrived to-day:- ' We have just been informed of the sad news of the death of M, Louis Tengoborsld, Privy Counclilor and mem. ber of the Council of the Empire, 'who expired in this capital this morning, at 8 o'clock, after a short illness. The works on subjects of finance and political economy published by this high functionary have gained for him a reputation thathas extendedfarbeyond the limits of our country. His death deprives the Emperor of an enlightened adviser, whose eminent talent were of great utility to his Sovereign and his country." The winter, which made its appearance in Rusia unusually early and with unusual severity, subsequently became unusually mild, and has at length taken its departure unusually early. You have already learnt that the ice began to move on the Neva on the 14th inst., the wind being at the time south-west and the thermometer shovdng 4 degrees Reaumur. On the day following the ice cleared off from the Revel Roads, the wind being at the time fresh from the south, and the thermometer showing 7 deg. Up to that time there were no merchant vessels in sight off Revel. In the south, as might be expected, the winter began its retreat still earlier. In Taganrog the roads began to free themselves from ice, March 13; in Kertch they were already open on the 11th, and trade and navigation already active. The Russian steamer Hussar had at the end of last month commenced plying from Odessa to Cherson and Nicolajen. The Austrian steamer Metternich had already opened the communication with Galatz; and further steamers for the Wolga were said to be building in some numbers. In the last week of March a portion of Odessa, the main Oherson road in the fatbokurg Peressip, was flooded by an incursion of the sea, which had broken down the dyke; a vessel laden with grain, intended for Constantinople, was washed ashore and wrecked. Mr. Matthew, our ConsulGeneral, arrived in Odessa on the 21st ult. Colonel lwanine, of the Etat Major, and General Tschrikow have set off for iars for the purpose of co-operating withEnglish, French, andTurkish Commissaries in the settlement of the Russo-Turkish frontier in Asia. A party of 28 Turkish Tatars, who were endeavouring to smuggle some grain across the frontier from Alexandropol (Gunri), on the 17th of February, were surprised by a snowstorm, and such of them as were not frozen to death fell into the clutches of the Russian frontier gauard. On the 1st of February the Schapzugens endeavoured to avail themselves, as usual, of the Kuban having frozen over to disquiet the Russian posts on the right bank, and crossed over to the number of about 500 men strong, in three parties. The Cossack riflemen were, however, vigilant, and received them with such a brisk fire that the first party fell back on the second; the consequence of this concentration of weight on one portion of the weak ice was that it gave way, and the greater part of the attacking party perished in the icy waters of the Kuban.
M. PATt1EAU 8 GALLERY OF PAn1TGS.-The sale of the fine collection of paintings of M. Patureau, which the Emperor thought of suffcient interest to visit on Saturday, commenced on Monday at the Hotel des Ventes, in the Rue Drouot, M. Pillet being the auctioneer. A cert3ain number of tickets of admission had been given to persons enjoying a certain celebrity as connoisseurs, but had the room been of four times greater capacity it would still have been crowded. As, however, all the places were numbered, no confusion ensued, and the proceedings went on with great regularity. At a quarter to 3 the doors were openod to the public, and a tremendous rush took place.

THE WIVELISUOMBE MUBDBB. TAUNTON, Api'tn 21L This morning, at 8 o'clock, Thomas Nation suffered the extreme penalty of the law in front of the Somerset County Gaol, in this town. The prisoner, it will be recoUected, was convicted upon very clear evidenee at the recent assize for this eounty of the murder of John Aplin, a farm labourer, living at Chidgeley, near Wiveliscombe. Tha crowd assemblod consisted of from 6,000 to 8,000, of whom nearly half were women, the whole being of the lower classes. But few of the inhabitants of Taunton were present, and the crowd for the most part was composed of rustics, among whom were many of the gipsy tribe. The authorities had judiciously kept the bour of execution secret, and it having been announced by some of the local prints that the execution would not take place tiU noon the attendance of spectators was smaller than had been anticipated. The scaffold was erected at daybreak. The prisoner, who had slept soundly with but short intermissionduringthe night, rose early, and was visited by the chaplain, the Rev. R. 31ant, and subsequently by the nnder-sheriff Mr. J Nicholetts. At 7 a.m. divine service was performed in the gaol chapel, which was attended by the convict and all the prisoners in the gaol. At the conclusion of the service aU the other prisorers were conducted to theircells, and Nation remained behind to receive the sacrament. This ceremony over, the prisoner, accomoanied by the chaplain, the governor (Mr. W. Oakley) and several offices of the gaol proceeded to one of the wards, where Calcraft, the executioner, performed the operation of pinionirg the pisoner. During this process one exclamation only escaped Nation who said to Caleraft, " Don't hurt me; I can hardly breathe." At this time the wretched culprit appeared to be suffering great mental emoton Quickly recovering his former self-possession, the pro. cession, headed by the chaplain, reading the burial service, and accompanied by the governor and other officers of the gaol, moved towards the drop. The prison-bell, tolling the knell of a living man, strack out as the turnkeys mounted the platform, followed by Calcraft, next to whom came the convict, who walked with a firm step. The prisoner was immediately placed under the drop, and his head and face were covered with a white cap by the executioner. The rope having been adjusted and made fast to the beam above Caicraft and the turnkeys withdrew from the platform. The chaplain continued reading the burial service; but at a g*ien signal the bolt was withdrawn, the drop fell, and, after a few convulsive struggles, the sentence of the law was fulfilled, and the murderer was dead. The body hung for an hour, and was then cut down, and in accordance with custom was interred within the precincts of the gaol. The crowd dispersed almost as sooa as the life of the wretched culprit was extinct. Notwithstanding the ministrations of the Rev. R. Mant, the chaplain, have been unceasing since Nation's conviction, and at the prisoner's own request he has been visited by the Rev. - Berey, the clargyman of bis own paiinh, Upton, the Rev. J. Ilewellin, of Wiveliscombe. and the Rev. F. J. Smith, incumbent of Trinity Church, Taunton, the wretched man disregarded the solemn and earnest exhortations addressed to him, and died without making any express confession of his guilt. He admitted having perpetrated other crimes, as numerous, he said, as the hairs of his head, but he denied to the last having been the murderer of Aplin, and accounted for several of the evidences of his gullt by plausible, but unsatisfactory statements. The exhortations of the clergmnen were seconded by the fabber and brother of the prisoner, but produced no effect upon him. A memorial, addressed to the Home Secretury by Mr. Taunton, the prisoner's solicitor, praying a reprieve and commutation of the sentence on various legal and other grounds, was forwarded last week. To this Mr. Waddington replied, on Saturday last, that Sir George Grey bad communicated on the subject with Lord Chief-Justice Cockburn, before whom the trial tookplace; that his Lordship was satisfied that the verdict was In accordance with the evidence and left no doubt of the prisoner's guilt; that Sir George Grey saw no reason for interference, and that therefore the law must take its course. The resalt of this application was made known to the prisoner, but, although al hoe of life was thus cut off, he persisted to the last in eclaring his innocence of the crime for wbich he was condemned to die. With a solicitude characterstic of criminals of this clamS Nation addressed letters to his brother and other members of the family, pointing oat the evil effects of bad company, and expressing a hope that his dear sister would meet him in Heaven. He also made gifts of some of the publications of the Religious Tract Society to his brother. Of his guilt of the crime for which he suffered, however, there was neither moral nor legal doubt; and despite of his penitence for other undivulged offences Nation quitted the world without the poor atonement of acknowledging the justice of the sentence which consigned him to the gallowvs.
PueBnc MoNMsMsS.-By the removal of a house in Great St. Helen's the south transept of the ancient conventual church of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, is now visible. It is in very rough condition, having been partly covered by the buildings latel pulled down but is very interesting. An opportunity is now presented of seeing this relic of antiquity, but, we fear, not of preserving or restozing it. It is very much to be regretted there is no public board or department to which an appeal can be made on such occasions. In this instance an edifice of great antiquityand interest, which would be eagerly preserved elsewhere, will be hidden from sight, and exposed to destruction from the new buildings being run up against it, whereas the site might be purebased for a moderate sum, and the church be put m good condition. Some time hence this will, perhaps, be tbought of, and then not oDly the site but the building will have to be acquired. In the immediateneighbourhooa, and, indeed, in sight, is Crosby-hall, the lease of which is now for sale, and it is proposed to form a subscription for its purchase, to secure the building for public purposes, and to rescue it from those chances of alienation and destruction which have been already so unfavourable to it. As the suin required is 6,000. or 7,000., it becomes questionable whether the amount wiU be realized. We recommend the committee for the purchase to apply in this eme to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, who have been latel selling Crown lands, and who have fumda to reinvest. Whey can justifiably invest in Crosby-hall, by way of mortgage or purchase, as it is 4 properky which will yield a rental, and tbey may make conditions which will iseure the building for public uses and not prove burdensome to the reveuue. If the Commissioners of Woods and Forests have no funds they are justified in appropriating, then, perhab an application to tbe Treasury and Exchequer Bil Commissoners may be successful in obtaining a loan for the purchase, on condition that the property shall be t settled to publlc uses and the principal be psia off by I instalments, Btie are twvo legitimate oppottunities for ; 2escning. wds of *ntiquity and of arcbiteA l interis* an,d yet for wai of the funds, .which *ould be availszble i~t Bratib. epohniie may b est-itZX%r. 9
!VEE GR,PAT 4L4N1!TICrBksJAIN 'TR)EOAA4. iVABL. -- About a mile or so below GleeaxdlWfstazds the factory o Messrs. Glass and Elliot, X lwhe**great aubesoesin able by wbhih it is hoped to connect Xngland with Amnea$ j in rapid course of completion. Tb, rolls of wire, tons of hemp yarn, and xinguLarlooking dOtms from the Outt&. Percha Company, which aro inoesantly pouring fatothe works, betoken the presence of *n ur%ud e kind d ranufacture, and this idea is quito borne oiA by a me glance over the preisies themselves. The firt objeet whiuhL attracts the viitor's attention on entering the yard is tbe vast bulk of cable already completed. On each side of the path are two large circular docks or pits, in which about 600 miles are piled away in four massive coils, each 35 feet in diameter. It appars so manageable and oo suppe as the men drag it from the building in which itis manufactured that it is difficalt to realize the fact that the greater part of its bulk is iron wire, or that a light and alight looking rope of that kind is intended to form a perpetual medisui of communication under the 3,oo mgles of one of the deepest and stormiest seas in the world. Such, however, is the result which it is hoped to achieve, though whether it will do to or not is quite another question,and one full of doubt and difficulty. Before entering further into the subject we may as well mention that the whole cable is being constructed in two equal portions-one-half being made at Messrs. NeWalVs works at Birkenhead, and the other at Messrs. Gls sad Elliot's at East Greenwich The reason for this subdivision is that it was quite impossible for one manufactory to complete such a gigantic undertaldng within the allotted time. Each firm is bound by oontract to have 1,250 miles ready for shipment by July, and as many miles more as they cau get completed in that time. Already at the two manufactories about ];200 miles have been made. Glass and Eliot produce at the rate of 70 miles per week, but with an additional machine in course I of erection they will in a few days be able to increa thst amount to 100 miles. W*helieve both firms expect to have about 1,400 miles completed within the period spwecfied In their agreement;. The interest with which the progres of this great work is regarded on both aidesof the Atlntic will excuse oGtr giving a brief description of the various pro- ! oesm through which the cable passes in its course towards completion. The conducting wire through which the electric current Will have topaw consists of seven No. 22 oopper wires twisted into one strand the thicknes of a To. 13 wire, or about 1-16th ol an inch. This, I we beheve, is made by the Gutta Percha Cot-r pany, or at al events coated by them with three folds of gutta percha, which increases the diameter of the whole to three-eighths of aninch. Iithisformitisdelivered at themanufactories, coiled on wooden drums in two-mile lengths, with A short piece of the copper conductor left out at each end for the purpose of joining. As these arrive at Greenwich the ends of the conductor are carefully brazed together, bound round with gutta percha, and so joined to I the entire length of. the cable, which, all in one piece, is going through the different stages of manufacture in the various floors of the works. One' end of the cable is con- nected with a sand battery of 240 cells, which maintains a i continuous current through the whole, in order that i tho connexion and insulation of every neW tWo-mile length may be scertained with the galvanometer as each piece is joined. The workman, therefore, who joins the ends, being in connexion with the current, is obliged to be insulated from the floor with thick pieces of i gutta percha under his feet, to prevent his receiving severe proofs of the perfection with which the current is carried through. The wire thus coated and joined is then wound offto the " serving" machine, where it passes up the centre of a horizontal wheel on which are placed five bobbins, each of which is supplied with mauy hundreds of yards of fivethread yarn soaked in a mixture of pitch, tar, oil, and tallow. As the wire moves slowly through this the bobbin wheel revolves at the rate of 375 times a minute, spinning the five strands of yarn tightly about it, so as not to leave the smallest interstice. It passes from this through a gauge, which shows its diameter to be 9-16ths of an inch exactly, and the electric current with which it is in connexion proves by the needle of the galvanometer that the connexion and insulation of each fathom as it moves off has been uninjured by the " serving" process. It then only remains to " close" or bind it ap in wire. In this operation an enormous amount of wire is consumed daily; indeed more is wanted than all the wire drawers in England can supply, though to do so, they are now tasking their powers of production to the very atmost. Of the amount required our readers may judge by the fact that,when completed, the Wholo cable will contain enough wire to encircle the globe nearly 16 times, or nearly to reach to the moon and back again. The wire used for closing the outside is No. 22. Seven of theee are twisted into one strand, and 18 strands we twistedround the cable. The strand machine in which the seven wires are placed revolves 450 times per minute, binding the seven into one strong compact.strand, the same diameter as the conducting wire-viz., 1-16th of an inch. Each of the strand machines, worling night and day, spins 98 miles of wire into 14 miles of strand. There are 21 machines at work, which thus every 24 hours convert 2,058 miles of wire into 294 miles of. strand, which suffice to cover about 10 miles of the cable. After the strand is spun it is wound on to bobbins, and, having been carefully oiled and passed through a number of gauges to insure its being of tho requisite diameter throughout, the bobbins are placed in the closing machine, which is, of course, similar to that used for serving the yarn, but very much larger. By the revolution of 18 bobbins round the cable the 18 strands of wire are woven round it so as to form an almost compact metal cams. When theirgreat sizeand weight are taken into coDsideration these closing machines revolve at fearful rapidity, and the centrifugal force sometimes causes the massive bobbins to fly off, carrying everything before them. Fortunately as yet no casualties have occurred. The cable thus completed s drawn from the " closing" machines at the rate of 30 feet per minute through a gauge of five.eighths of an inch diameter, and then carried by revolving wheels through a tank of hot tar, issuing forth into the yard as fit as ever such a cable can be for its submarine duties. In the yard, as we have already said, it is coiled away in huge piles ready for shipment, each day's labour adding some inches to the height and bulk of the already ponderous masses. The half of the cable made at NewaU's works will be ship -d in July on board the Niagara American screwfriga_j, the longest and largest vessel of its class yet built. She will be accompanied for the occasion by the Mississippi frigate. The line made at Greenwich will be coiled on board the Agamem:non, which will also be accompanied by one of our largest steatn-frigates to assist in laying down. The four vessels will proceed in company to the centre of the Atlantic, where the ends of the cable will be carefully joined, and each ship will make the best of its way to its own shores, the Niagara steaming to Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, near the Peninsula of Avaion, and the Agamemnon to Valencia Bay, coenty of Kerry, on the south-west coast of Ireland. By this method the whole cable is expected to be laid in a week or 10 days at most. Five miles of the cable, where it joins in the ce tre, will be made of steel wire, to enable it to bear the great strain at starting. For 15 miles from the coast of Ireland it will also le made of immense strength and thickness,to insure it from 'ijury from ships' anchors. The same precautions are also to be adopted at the other extremity at Newfoundland, though only for five miles' distance from the shore, as the water there is very much deeper. It is intended to sink tho cable across the extensive plateau or bank formed by the course of the Gulf Stream on its northern side. The greatest depth here is 2,100 fathoms, or nearly two miles and a half. The average depth of the whole route is 1,400 fathoms, or a little more than one mile and a half. The direct distance from Valencia to Newfoundland is 1,690 geographical miles, so that between 400 and 500 miles of kable are allowed for " slack," and casualties. The Atlantic cable, of the construction and ultimate destination of which we have thus given an outline, is beyond all doubt a beautiful specimeu of manufacturing s-ilLu It possesses several essential requisites. Its cost, we believe, is only 1001. per mile; its weight only one ton per mile. It is contracted for to bear a strain of 3 tons 2 cwt., but it is stated to stand 4 tons with safety. Its speoific gravity is between three and four, its diameter is small, and it is as flexible as an ordinary rope. These are great advantages, but the sets off on the othor side are numerous and most important. In the first place, there is no wire for the retmrn current, and the conducting wire itself is ridiculously small (1-16th of an inch in diameter), when it is considered that it is intended to cary a current for nearly 3,000 miles. The latter is a most s-rious fault; so also is covering the outside with so fine a description of wires that three months' rust will entirely destroy them. Bat the greatest fault of aU is that, in our judgment, the whole cable is constructed on a wrong principle. In a previous article on the subject of submarine telegra. phic communication we pointed out tho errorr, which have already led to the destraction of so many cetbles, and the simple manner in which they are remed.ed by Mr. AUen's patents.

AN AMERECEA Vl-YI OP LOAD' PAZxlffz7TOR'$ (From the-New Yor-k Courier cd'Enquire-re, Will Palmerston beat? One cannot help taing a deep interest in the contest, even without refeence to the politiW cal questions it decides. The prompt, unconquerable spirit With which the Premier, when prosrated by the overwhelming combination of his antagonabt in the Hous of Commons, went forth to the country ta- give them battle there, and the fact that he is combating, almost Bisigihbanded, a corp3 of the very stronget men in AR Englkasd who, having no common agreement in anythingelse, yetrvia with each other in the determination todisablehim,naturahL excite a lively interest in his favour. No public ma inEMhg-: land, not even William Pitt, ever had to- struggle againjs such tremendous odds. The Tory champions, the Conservative champi'ons, the Whig champions, &ad the RadioaL champions, Lord Derby and Disraeli, Gladstone antL Graham, Lord John Russell and Grey, Cobden and, RbebuckW are all against him r And yet he not only stana his-ground, but he fights with a dashing vigour and self-possessed confi;7 dence that plainly denote he is bent upon victory. It is indeed a rare sight-this ehl veteran 7yeaes eof age, for40 years a member of Parliament, and a membei of almoeP every Ministry within the memory of liting- men, thu5' challenging his combined foes and plunging inbo the fierce; confQict of a general election with all the fire and- energy of youth; in fact, with a fire and energy which his youth lknew nothing of, for up to-middle age Lord Pahnerston exhibited: nothing but indolence, apathy, and heavy-paceod mediocrity, It is almost impossible to associate old age with Palmerston as be now is. There is not so nimble-handed, ao3 sure-eyed, so ready, so fearless a political gladiator in alIt England. Nowhere is seen sauch dexterity as his in touching vulnerable points with sarcastic venom, in mldng awfeinv oft argument arnswer all the purposes of a real home-thrmst, or: such agility in skipping about to avoid being hit and ir guarding himself against attack. The high spirit and' briliant skill of the old veteran in the face of so many adversaries cannot but enlist a certain personal sympathyon his side. But there are stronger considerations in his favour. Fir*, apart from the Chinese difficulty, the Palmorston Ministry has been eminently successful and popular. Its resistance of the premature proposals of peace made by those who ha4 held office during the first year of the war, and thevigour and determination with which it corrected the deplorable mismanagement of that year, and prosecuted the. siege of Sebastopol until the great stronghold fell an&P Russia humbly sued for the terms she had before haughtily repeled, gave that Ministry A prodigious claim to the grati-: tude and attachment of the British people. Its policy, and( the unshaken firmness with which it held to that policy,,. alone saved England from humiliation and dishonour.. The English people wil not be likely to forget the unflinohing courage and constancy of that Ministry in spite of al thei opposition that could be raised against them in Parliameent by renegade colleagues, in spite of every species of polit5cat discouragement, and in spite of a military resistance the' protracted obstinacy of which can hardly be paralleled inr the art of war. Up to the time of the attack by Six JbhrrBowring upon the Chinese the Ministry was in the highest degree popular and strong. It is not prohab1e that the suaLority of the English people regard that attack with favour, but they cannot help bearing in mind that it was made without instructions- from the home. Government, and by an official who received his ap.- pointment from a previous Administration. And; again,' they will not be apt to consider the questioh in. its originat shape. They will now hardly ask whether the original' attack was not precipitate and uncaUed for, so much ax whether, the attack having been made and the war tuallyr raging, the war shall not be conducted to a point that shalt insure security for the future, which could not be realizedshould the Chinese people seethe English Government overanxious to make peace, and tamely retreating from a stand it has once taken. The British people, though their agente. in China did not perhaps, as they should, " beware of entrance to a quarrel," wii yet, we think, take up with- the remaining advice of old Polonius, and belng in, "Bear itthat the oppopermay bewar of the" Another consideration that will operate strongly in favourof retaining Lord Palmerston as the head of the Covernment is the undeniable fact that not one of his many opponents has any real hold upon the popular heart at large, and that the Government could not be placed in The hands& of any one of them with any assurance of permanAncy. Tbs. very causes which have so signally contributed to the late. popularity of Lord Palmerston have detracted. from theirestimation. No mistake that the-Palmerston Ministry mayhave made in respect to China can affect the opinion entertained of the universally greater mistake of its adversaries in respect to Rassia. Hatred to Russia stiU remaiuns the dominant feeling of the British people ; and among all British statesmen there is no embodiment of that feeling to be found like Lord Palmerston.

2'B MUBBAIN, OR CATTLE PDAGUE. (Ri31O OUR VYNA C0MOIlWMf) On the outbreak of " catarrhal Affection of the lunos" those medicines which tend to reduco inflammaLtionl or the activity of the vital1 power are always employed in Austria. The ailing anirmal must be kept at home in a warm, aixf, clean stall, and an lectuary with sml dose6 of salt and gentian or ormwood administered three or four times a-day. he backs of the aialmust be washed with warm water and rubbed quite dry with wisps of straw. The food must be some greenmeat easy of digestion or good hay - the drink some mucilaginous fluid i which has beeD allowed to stand in a warm place. As soon as the alvine discharge has becomie more plentiful and the respiration freer the quantity of salt must be diminished, and elecampane-powfder, fennel, sulphur, and a fewI drops of oil of turpentine added to the eleetuary. The turpentine acts on the kidneys, and increases tho secretion of urine. Good hay, with oatmeal, and now and then a dose of the above-mentioned medicine, must be given for a few days after the catarrhal affection of the lungs has ceased. LI there is any tendency to putrid catarrhal fever, care must be takento prevent too great anaccumulation of food in the stomacb, the digestion must be aided, and the skin excited to action. The sick animal must be fed with scalded hay, potatoes, horse-chestnuts, and dosed with aromatic and balsamic medicines, conibined with camphor. If the inflammation is very severe and the breathing greatly oppreesed blood may be taken in moderate quantities, and mild purgatives given. At the outbreak of malignant and catarrhal fever, and more particularly if there is a determination of blood to the head, bleeding in the neck is absolutely necessary. Poultices made of common salt, vinegar, and clay, may be applied to the head and neck, and the whole body washed with vinegar or strong lye. If there is obstinate constipation, injections of salt or soap must be given. The internal remedies employe4are several dosws of ssltpetre-each consisting of 1 an ounce-which must be given every two or three hours. If doses, each consisting of two or three ounces of salt with half a drachm of tartar emetic, are subsequently administered, a marked improvement wl in general take place in two or three days. If, however, the malady makes urther pro&reBs, and the animal loses strength rapidly, tome remedies must be employed, and particularly the sweet spirits of nitre (spirit. nitri dulc.). If there is a great looseness, columbo root, with opium and small doses of rhubarb, must be given. If any typhoid symptoms should be observed, camphor and i,alsamic medicines may be tried; "but if malignant catarrhal affection of the lungs is in its third stage hardly one animal out of 10 can be saved" In the first stage of the complaint the flesh of the animal is innocuous; at the beginning of the second the sale of the meat is not prohibited, but no one is allowed to kll and sell the flesh of cattle which have reached the third stage of the malady. The medical police of this country does not consider the disease known as " malignant catarrhal affection of the lungs" contagious. The " lung disease" combined with typhus is not only a more fatal complaint than that above-men. tioned, but it is sometimes contagious. " If," says a learned and skilful veterinary professor, " the lung disease combined with typhus is to be cured, it must be attacked while the animal has its full strength and vigour." If the patient, being of robust constitution, and of middle age, has at the beginning of the malady a violent and dry cough, and fiery and inflamed eyes, from five to eight pounds of blood must be taken without loss of time. If the violence of the symp. tomns does not abate, the venesection may be repeated, but proper attention must always be paid to the constitution and age of the animl In all cases a mixture of turpentine, laurel oil, and cantharides powder must be rubbed in behind and below the shoulder-blades, and a seton, which has been anointed with the salve in. question, must be passed through the shoulders (withers is probably meant). M. Pey recommends that the whole of the back, beginning from the neck, should be rubbed with an ointm^~nt composed of turpentine oil and laurel oil, of each an ounce and a half, and of strong spirit of sal-ammoniacM spirits of camphor, and powdered Spanish lies, of each half an ounce. Before the salve is applied the wkole body should be well brushed or rubbed for half an hour. To clear the bowels clysters co-m posed of three or four ounces of common salt and camomile-tea should begiven everytwo or three hours. Mashes, with saltpetre, sal-ammoniac, and flowers of sulphur in them, may also be given, Some years ago a M. Merk asserted that a decoction of hemlock was a specific against the complaint, but the Viennaw physicians and veterinuay surgeons of the present day do not appear to be of the same opinion. If the complaint is in the second stage camphor, valerian, asafcetida, sulphur, and sulphuret of potash must be usd. Should an improvement take place less powerful medicines must be gradually substituted for those last mentionod If, on the contrary, such unfavourable symptoms as difficult respiration, violent cough, increasing emaciation, &c., continue for some time, the best thing that the agriculturist or grazler can do is to go to no further expense either for medicine or food. The sanitary measures taken by the medical police in this disease are the following :-The herd or farm is strictly examined, and all those auimals that cough are put on the sick list, and must be kept apart. As the " lung disease"' is believed to be contagious, not only the herd in which it prevails, but also the men who tend It are kept from communication with the surrounding farms, bamlets, &c. Instead of being driven out to graze, the cattle are fed on the premises, and it has been observed that a change from green to dry food always produces a good effect on the animals which are stiU healthy. The sick cattle have their own attendants, who are not allowed to go near the other stalls, and a healthy animal is never allowed to dk out of a pail which has been used by one that iS unwelL. The carcases of the cattle which die must be buried in a very deep pit with the straw on which they had lain. If the cattle are skinned, the skins are for a time to be put into a lime-pit. If the disease assumes a very malignant form in any place, a cordon is drawn round it, which is not raised until six weeks from the time of the last death. The stalls or stables in which sick cattle have been kept are always scrupulously scoured, the various implements cleaned -with strong lye, and the cribs, mangers, &c., washed with a solution of chloride of lime. Some time must elapse before the convalescent animals can safely be allowed to join their fellows. Of the treatment of the real murrain, or cattle plague (RBnder Pest), there is nothing more to be said than that the best and most economical method is to knock every animal on the head as soon as he is attacked by it. The "l ser L iirre," as it is here called, has invariably been brought into the country by cattle coming from Podolia, Beasarabia, or the Danubian Principalities, and we continually read that the importation of beasts from those provinces is prohibited. As soon as it is mnown that the plague is raging on the other side of the frontier a cordon is drawn, which is not rAised until the disease ha entirely ceased. If this Government finds it necessary to have a number of beasts killed in order to put an end to a contagious diseaw, th e proprietor zoeceives- l -ha from the State; but the sum is so ridiculously small that many sick cattle are driven away and sold to the next beat butcher before the authorities are aware that the murrain has made its appearance. If a butoher on killing an animal finds it to be diseased and does not inform the police of the fact he is liable to be fined 41. for each offence. If he an- nounoes his discovery he only receives 51. as au i4demnification for his loss. The "cWser," Q third stomach, of cattle which die of the XWa or steppe murrain is invariably diseasod. on the outaide it is generally covea with livid Tots, and in the inside is found ruminated food, not in a pulpy m , s it ought to be, but in the form of ^ dry, dark-green, coarse powder, which is pesedin beire the " leaves ' of the " ldser."* F e fourth stom ch is always either highly inflmed vr gangrenous. During the Ruso-Turkish war in 1827 and 1828 RPsian herds driven into Silesia brought the murrain with them., which caried off 30,000 head of cale in Hungay, 12,000 in Gallicia, and 9,000 in M3oraia. Acoording to a very moderate estimate Xde by I Faust, the ateppe murrain had at the end oite lA oentury camied off 28,000,000 head -of wtJe in Germany. AwPOW4 Wad_ C. ur4 el it " d~ rdsis*~
MILITARY DUCATION1 AND PUBLIC SCHOLS. The folloinR letter lis been addresed by Dr. Vaughan, of arrTOf, to an ofiicer concerned in military education: *-Dear Sir,-I sn deeply interestedin the questions re. ferred to in your letter and in the accompaying papers. I wish I could hope thAt anything which I might renasrk upon them would be worthy of your attention. The only thing which I oan attompt without great presumption is to oxpress tho results of my own observation and experience in a few leading particulars. " L I feel very trongly the evils of any vsatm which necessitates the premature withdrawal of boys from public schools, in order to subject them to a special and private, course of preparation for the army. The army, the public schools, and the individua alike xuffer from this-the first and third, positively, by a harrow and superficial process of training; the second, negUvely, by the subtractio of a useful element. "if there be any professoio for which a public shool offers a salutary discipline, Assuredly it Is the army. The habit of regarding oneself, and of flding onesdf trted, as only ose member of a body, in the rules and interests of which self must be to a great degree merged; the necessty of submitting to authority, even when that authority is exer. cised neither courteously nor, perhaps, considerately; the practical experience of varieties of temper and opinion in those around and above one; the correction of false notiont (often formed and fogtered in childhood) of dignity and selfimportance; the insensible formation of the tone and man. ners of a gentleman, which is so generaly the result (even in cases of little early advantage) of a public education; these and many other things which might be enumerated make it of the utmost consequence that the publio school element should be etrong-I might almost say predominant -amongthe offioers of the English army. "And it is very important (though not always taken into account) that this publio school education should not end too early. Its chief benefits are found in its later stags. So far as knowledge is concerned, no one will doubt this. But it is trae in other and even more important respects. Haits of self-oontrol in point of language end manner, of deferenoe to authority and condderation ror equals, not to mention what I consider to be of the utmost importanoe in refereno to the training of officersthe responsibility thrown upon the elder boys of a public school with regard to the conduct of their juniors-aro al acquired gradually, and often slowly; and a boy who leaves school at a low point in it will probably have filed to gain them. " 2. On the other hand, I deprecate the formation of an isolated militay seCtio In a public school. If boys destined for the army are to stay at a publio school till they go up for examination for their oommisions they ought to stay there as ende participants in the education as well a socdety of the school, and not be put into a position of marked difference-a school within a school, for exAmple (as sometimes proposed), into a separate boarding-house, under a separate tutor, with a totally distinct department of study, &c. The advantage of their remaining at a publio school is dependent upon their being mired up in all its oompetitions and associations, though there may be no harm in their having some private instruction (out of school hours) on special subjects saitable to their future professon superadded to that which forms the staple work of the schooL Thus, at Harrow the militay pupils dhe in all the cladic studies, examina. tions, Ic., of the rest of the school, with the single exoep. tion that, instead of verse oomposition, they have extra instruction in mathematics (besides a we ekly lesson in forti fication and mnilitary drawing), the marks which they lose (in examinations for removes, &o.) by the absence of verses being compensated by extra papers in mathematics. They ar thus enabled to keep or improve their relative places among their schoolfellows, and to retain to the ful their interoet in every part of their studies, 'while they remain at Hlrrow. " 3. From these two considerations-the Importance of retaining military boys in publio schools, and, on the other hand, the undesirablenessof severing them from the regular work of the school-it follows, in my opinion, that the preliminary examination for commnlssons must eithor (I) be fixed at a very low standard, or lwse (2) be mide general enough to embrace all the ordinary studies of a public sohooL " (L) To the former alternative there seem to me to be obvious objections. It gives a contemptible aspect to the qualifications for the army. It enoourages early idlenes, and late cramming. It makes boys neglect the studies of scheol, and rely upon a brief speial effort to carry them through at last. It is entlrly fallaclous as a test of capa. city or of dUligenoe, and dstroys all stimulus to high proficiency. I can understand, indeed, that it may be neoessary to mention certain things in which entire failure would be a disqualification in iminine for a commission. Bad spellug, bad grammar, very bad writlng, Ignorance of arithmetio-perhats of the elements of algebra, and of a book or two of Euclid-might come under this head. These things are easily defined, and would never be construed into more than negative conditions. This is a very different thing from professing to define generally the minimum of knowledge required for a pass. It Is one thing to say 'Certain things ars fatal,' and quite another thing to say, 'Certain things are enough.' " (2.) The second alternative is to open wide the subjects of examination, so as to embrce, with equal favour, aU those on which a public schoolboy has professedly speat his time. " I can have no hesitation in preferring this latter a_ter. native. Assuming, as I surely may, that more special military instruction can be provided for in the interval between pasing for a commission and actually entering upon regimental duties, I cannot see why a young man should not be examined in the first instantc upon neutral ground, to ascertain bow far he hs profited by the education he has had, rather than how much he has been able to do in spite (or, at all events, beside the mark) of the system under which he professes to hava been trained. More often than not, a boy who has cultivated classics successfully would succeed also in mathematics or military scienoo when his at. tention is turned to that study. At all events, one who has well used the means of improvement which he has had is more likely to make a good offlicer, or a good anything, than one who has not, even though the latter may have contrived by a brief course of cramming to reach a certain modicum of marks in a speial subject or two of examination. "'Under present circumstanoes, with the prevalent impression that a boy going into the army does net requirmuch knowledge of clasics, the military pupils in a public school are generally to be found low in the schooL calculating upon making up by spedcl preparation in mathematics or military science during a few weeks or months before going up for a commission for a constant neglect of that which has been professedly their chief study at school. It would be a great gain to the army and to themselves if it were known that what is required for a commisson is a diligent and well-spent boyhood; the army would then be officered, in part at least, by the best instead of by the worst of our public school pupils; and I doubt not they would be found in two yars after passng for their com' miesion at least as good, even in their special professional attainments, as other young men who had made these at an earlier age their one object. "Let, then, the topics of the first examination range themselves under the most general heads of classics, mathematics, modern languages, and history; to which, if it be thought desirable, might be added some elementary trial in drawing and in the principles of fortfidcaton,to such an extent as a boy at school might be supposed capable of purs1uing these twvo last-named subjects aS an accomplishment rather than a business. Let the candidates do what they can in each of these branches of examinstion, It being provided that in each there be elementary sw well as more ad- vanced questons. Let the total number of marks obtained by each candidate in each subject, as woll as on the aggregate, be publicly known, snd lot the order of merit decide the order of appointmenttoprovisionalcommions. From this point let that special training commence (at Sandhurst or elsewhere) which is to quafy for professional duties, and the result of which, on an examination at the end, say of two years, is to decide into which branch of the servioe (if any) each individual is to be admitted. " On this prlnciple, a public schoolboy destined for the army will feel throughout his school-life that every day's attention to his appointed work at school is telling directly upon his profesdonal success, De not attempt, I would say, to define beforehand what he must know in order to pass the first examination for the army, but try what he does know, and judge from that whether he gives promise of doing well what he will have to do hereafter. " 4. I am not sanguine, however, as to any great prospect of improvement in the aitinments of candidates for the army, unless, to some real extent, A principle of competition be introduced into every branch of tho serice. If it were once vnderstood tht the promise of a commision meant only a permision to compete for a commission, or, in other words, a nomination for the list o1 candidatesJ if the lis of young men thus nominated for Comiions were always avowedly larger than the number of commiJdon to be given, so that a boy going lp to compete mud be among the ftst two-thirds or threeoiurth of the candidites (in order of merit) to secure his sucoess; then the result would be quite otin-boys would work at school, and the gsandud both of our publlo schools and of the army would rims In proporUon. XTwY (s m my m 16 to 18, eefont17 to 19t sat be allowed to each candidate for this competition; examinstions might be held twioe in each year, so that eah nominated Cwadidate would have four chanes allowedhim; if he did not como witian the limit of ucoess the first time, be Mtight do so the second or the third; only let the criterion be A certain measure of sucoes in a competition, and not a certain minimum of knowledge, to bo judged by a fixed (or perhap 4 by a v%nable) stsadard. " Nor would any injnuryrest to a young manws education from a failure (even if final) to secumr his commission. As he will have been examined in the sabjects on which he wra I engaged at school, so he may return, time after time, to school to resume his work there, without having lost a day upon prsuits therm useless He might mltimately adop. another profession without being one whit lews well prs. pared for it than if he had never competed for a commis zion. But, even if ultimate failures were not more f,o quent than atpreen still there would bo added the grea; stimulus of gaining a commisdon earlier or later, within tt, prescribed limits of age, and higher or lower in point of merit on the list of suooessful codidate. " 5 I have but lttle hope of boys at public schools obtain ing commissions in the Engineers or Artllery (on the presest ssem of a competition open, in the case of those branehes of the service, to the whole country), unless such an amount of attention were paid during their school-life to mathematics and some other special subjects as would bo quite incompatible with their continuing the full classical and general routine of their education. But if the plan suggested, I think, in the paper forwarded to me war- acted upon, of having but one preliminy training, a; 8andhurst or elsewhere, for all departments of the serviceEngineers. Artilery, and the Line-I have no doubt that many public schoolmen would, after a year or two of that special discipline, be found qualified for the moro scientific branches of the army, and none the less so for having deferred their more special training till a good foandation of classical and general knowledge had been first laid. "6. It must not be supposed that I overrate the import ance of literary ascompred with other attainments in a cndidate for the A. But I have yet tolearn that boy is likely to be more gentlemanlike or more manly for being idle and i norant. No doubt many moral and physdeil qualities are indispcnsable to the perfection of an oficer. But as moral qualities ca hardly be discerned by any test, so there are very easy tests of the physical, the due application of which may here be presupposed. Indeed, I question whether it is a frequent oocurrence that a boy decidedly deficient in bodily health and activity should destine himself for the army. And, At all events, it is with the intelloctual part of the question that -,re are at present concerned. "7. Nor, again, would I desie to pitch too high the intelectul standard itself. But I see no fear of this The question rather -supposing that the very same clas of men are to enter the army who enter the army now-how n they be most effectually induced to make the most of such abilities as they possess, and of such educational advantagesasaregiventhem? AndIamoonvincedthatthiseili best bs done (1) by having them examined, not in xpecial subjeot prepared for the occasion, but in such subjects as their boyhood hsg been professedly sPent in studylng; and (2) by their being stimulated by at least a moderate ystem of competition to desire to get a high place among those who may have been educated In the same way, and are now candidates for the same profesdon. If the number of nominated candidates were to the number of commissions actually competed for but in the ratio of threo to two, and If the names of those examined were afterwards published In order of merit, I believe that the effect upon the early education of our future offioers would be immense. " any other topics suggest themnelves for remark; but I have no time to enter upon them, and perhans I have already said too much. My ardent desire to see the military education of the country plaod upon a sound and practical basis must be my excuse for responding at so much length to your hind request for my opinion.

ELDUCATION? ANZD CrIM. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIES. Sir,-It would throw no small light upon this mn. portant question, so soon to be diwussed doubtless in the new Parliament, if you would allow a place in your columns to oorrespondents qualified to give an intelligent view of the subject from their oonnexion with education in its practical bcarMigs. With this object, at east, beg to offer to you the following oontribution upon one of its various pha e-its iunice upon publio morals, and espe. aIlly as it regards crime. L Pnblic opinion, as represented in the late Parliament, seems to be divided on the subject into two distinct cases of sentiment; theoneregardingextendedrecular educationLasa sort of panacea, the other viewing It with feelings rather of apprehension. In both the probable result of any action of the Iegisature seems to beexsggerated; foE, judging from the past, the speed of Parliament in social matters Wll scaroely ever overtake the growth either of the number or the wants of the people. That a great extensiou of secular knowledge would prove in the maiu a great benefit to the country, there can bo no reasonable doubt; but that it would have concomitant evil results, numerous and dangerous, appears to me at least no less certin. An augmen tation of the national resources must always follow the increased sill, spirit of enterprise, and increased power of individuals, while, as regards morals, education causes an abatement of the grosser vices aud crimes in the population, and an increase of intelligence and activity for good purposes in the religious portion of the community. The evil effects to he expected are dissatisfaction with natural position, affectation of a higher olass, the creation of artificial wants and consequent embarrassments, with an increrae of certain crimes aga property; and, as regards religion, a greater measure of Irreverence for its authoritative teaching, and of positive infidelity. The expeience of the country of late years has been of this kind. The people as a whole have advanoed a stage or two In refinement aud the enjoyments of intelUectual life. They have sensibly less pleasure in brutal sports than the last generation. They have become more Intelligent acoessories of public justice as jurora ani witnesses, and are less easily deluded by mischievoua and crafty demagogue But, on the other hand, it cannot b3 denied that there has been, contemporaneously with thi general improvement, aud plainly from the increased power which knowledge imparts, a growth of some most serious evils; for instance, a vast circulation of licentious aud infidel publications, and an incease of such crimes as forgery, embezzlement, complicated fraud, ingenious imposture, and of tricks in trade amounting to crime, although not aWays punishable by law often not a whit less heinous; in some cases, indeed, mucn more so, as in the adulteration of food and medicine. These may be considered the exceptionable reslts of advancing civilization, but they are so many and so important that one may well be excused for having some misgivings on the subject, or at least for :kot being over sanguino in expectation of results. ppily, in England the institutions of our religious and civl polity are such as commend themselves to a people acquirng knoxwledge and intelligence, being founded in truth and justice; otherwise, the effect of increased light and power of thought. would be to unsettle all things, and to endangerthe existence of both. The free and constitu. tional Government of England and the scriptural religon of England have nothing to fear from the powers of the human understanding, however enlarged, or however closdy brought to the examination of their merits. 2. Now, to speak specifically n;bout crime, rs influenced by education. It is constantly insisted upon by the advocates of extended popular educetion that criminals as a class, are deplorably ignorant, and the statistics of prisons and statements of many chaplains are quoted in attestation of the fact. This is notornously the case. But the inference from the fact that ignorance is a fruitful source of crime IS not fairly drawn unless it can be shown that igno rance iD exclusively characteristic of the criminal class, and this has never yet been done. For my owtn part, I do not believe that the criminal class, especially convcts, are a whit more ignorant than the noncriminal in the same walks of life. As regards convicts, who are thehighest c)sass of criminals, I am satisfied, if they w ere catechized, as chaplains o-xmiue prisoners, along with as many honest coatheavers, miners, farm labourers, factory operatives, or even artisans, they would come rather better out of the examination. However this may be, it is certain, at all events, that ignoranoe marks the lowost order of crime far more than it does the highest. I have studied this aspect of the question for many years-painfully from real lifo-andl have no hesitation in aTrming that the worst elass of criminals (I do not mean the most brutal and savage, but the most injurious to society) have been men of above the average condition of mental powers mnd educational advantages. I speak of such men as "putters up' of robberies, receivers of stolen property, trainers of thieves, impostors of all sorts, propagators of infidelity, leaders of Chartism, and suchlike; and this experience Is borne out by such general facts as the following:- The average number of prisoners under summary conviction cliassedby the inspectors of prisons In their last report as having " little or no education'1ia 95 in the 100 (leaving out the fractions). In the cases of convi:ction atv the assires and sessions it is 90 in the 100- while of convicts it is but 80 in the 100 at the most. It is more han probable that if the sessions and assize cases were distinushed, the number of uneducated would be found lesa in h asize oonvictions than in those of the sewsions; for this indonbtedlyIs the fact as regards convicts who are chiefly condemned by the higher tribunal of asie; the nurmber of men having "little or no education" in this prison (exclusively devoted to convicts) having been at no period of itH history more than 80 in the 100, and oftener muoh less; we have set It down above at 80. I have further classed our convicts, and have found that the proportion of men doomed to petual exile or perpetwu pensl servitude (man of w am had at thefirst reoeived sentence of death) " having little or no education" i only 5l in the 100; and of the men on wat is alld the " double penal list,' consisting of convicts sent back to sparte onufinementc for further probation ad punshbmet it; conseqeance of outrageous conduct and rimes eftbo gtoueatkin&iX the pi,oportfon falls to 28 in thelOG. Of ihs XetI mayb aU.Zed tht they had, by long ImprisOn. et in paoIa wh,r acita eihoe;ms.e r emplcyod advanced considerably from their original giatus in know. ledge. This is in great mesure trco; therefore all I shsl of these is, tha'i the secular oducation of which they eviaenty availed themselves did not produce in them real moral improvement anymore than the religious instruction under wbich they were placed, but which they notoriously deqplsedL The conclusion in my own mind from such facts, a welr u from general observation, is that education only changs the eharacter of crime- that it improves the intel. lect, but doe0 not reform the fisrt ; that it is an immense boon to those who have good moral principle, or even good common sense, but an injury to those who have neither rendering them more mischievous and more incorrzible wrhen they do fall into crime, and more miserable. It ilso aniniaztbytheirmesr3totheEltate, ocinferringtheinerLmeof power,whichshouldbeforgood, butisonlvforeviL Amostimr portant part of the question of extended popular education seem to me, therefore, to be, how beat shall education be promoted so that more good and less evil shaU result from it ? own solutionof thequestion is, thatgreatercare should bh en in selecting the educator, whose mission is of so mach hnportanco; next, that education should not soar above the orinary rquirements of the pupil nataral sttion in life (allowance being made for exceptional cases of extraordinary talent); and lastly, that it ehould be directed more to the training of our peasantry for industal and domestic purpoe than for the display of talent and the ostentation of pubIlo ;amination, and especiaUy s regards females, ooncerning whom, I fear, society haa lost more than it has gained by the march of intellect and the refined civilization of late yeas. It is to be lamented that the national statistics are not of so much use here as they might easly be made. It woald be mani esty of great importance in the discus iion of this most important question to have reliable tatis. tics, collected on one uWform system, in at least the Poor Xaw Department, the coivict service, the general prisons of the country nd the general registration or censn3 of the people, in which now the plans for collecting atistics of owledge are diverse AschemeemanatingfromtheCommittec of Privy Council on Education, accompanied with a request to the heds of these departments to require it to be aoted upon by their sbordlnabest would prodace this uniformity, and then more certain conclusions miht he come to from the greater number and the ear correctnes of the facts of the case. S. Ia conclusion, I would venture to tbrow out one or two practcal suggestons. * The education of the people is principally in the hands of the clergy of the established church, not only as regards religon and morals, but also sewular knowled6 ; a distingaishink honour, truly, but a dist Oic in volves tremendous responsibility. For ae the people retrograding in knowledge snd virtue? We must take to ourselves m chicr the blame. Are they advancinIn these respets I We are entitled to but little praise for the improvementis, after all, very scant compaed with the opportunities for the moral and educationita welfare of ourcoonutrymen which, it must bh acknowledged, woe poses, and auredlv7 "to whom much is given from them it shall be required.' But I amnot going to read a lecture to those who are my betters In every sense upon their responsibilities. My attempt is rather to call the attention of the cler to one paticular in their ministrations in oonnexion with my aublect which I have not seen noticed-I mean the educational infRcence which the services of the church, when rightly performed, have upon the people who frequent them. Every such erTice i, in fact, when viewed in this iht, a weehy lemson to the less educated of every parish in the English lnguage, both in reading and correct pronunciation. Some adult persons do thus actually teach themselves to read. In a parish of which I onoe had chare I knew a sailor who taught himself to read vezy intelligently from knowing only the very first rudiments, by attending to the prayers and readngs of Holy Scriptre in the church on the Lord'sday whenever he was in port; and I have known many prisoners who have acqUIr more knowledge in redgby this method than by the les froquently recurring h of the prison schoolmaster. Further, when the church service is rightly performed it conTeys Instrauction in singing and musnc, and just of that sort which may be carried ia tDhe memory home, there to be joined inb all, parent and children, with the happiest effect; and iti a constantly recurring opportunity, of course, to the pain3-taking cle man by which, securing the attention of hearers generally attached to him personally) by 'well-selected iscourse and happyr illustration, h:e may improve their powrers of under standing and enlarge their stock of knoowledge, as well as icnfluentce for good, under the Divine blessing, their wrhole Nothing is easier, of course, than to turn this picture of a church service into too pleasant ridicule by the actual contrast, so frequently still to be met with throughout England, of indistinct, hurrled, school-boy reading of our beautiful Liturgy; of sermons 'oarren of thought, of aru mnent, of illustration-of everythmnS, in fact, likely to lnterest the hearer; of parish clerks wno Iike thae sermons of the good man in the pulpit, seem alstys to belong to a bygone age; and of the barbarous muic of the villae choir Bu, after all, these are hut exceptional ceasese and happily they are on the decrease, although there is too much room for improvement still on all bands. The get object of the ministry is, ot coure infinitely hiher than the mere cultivation| of the taste or enlightening the understanding of the people; but this higher object can plainly not he attained unless the people in. the fist place can he got to listen, and thcn,then you get them to church, unless they be interested, We read that "the common people beard our Lord gladly, and so they nowr listn -ladly to all his servants who, in humnble Imitation of their Diince Master, illnstga and enforce btrut by exaples fom real life and nauril common objects; and wrho ut the isame time command respect by tbeir lives. And certainly, unless the clergy keep ahead of the advancing intelligence of the poie, supposing it to rec.kw further stimulus, they il slhylose at last their nantaeground, to the gret ihjry,slIbdieve, of the country as well as of religion. We hae aledy lot too mu our hold of themases L,et us in time correct our errors in the matter of our discouxrses if need be, choosing rather to combat real gigantic evils, deplored by all, than the mistakes of our brethren within and w/ithout the church; or,i if not the matter, at least tlie mnansr and style of our teaching. Mr Sprgeonhere is teachingnus a very useful lesson, have accomplised a reb anatngbnftto the country at larg I have not had the advantage of hearing this nowr celebrated man, hut I perceive from his published sermons that, like Wesley and Whitfield and all who have ever succeeded in arresing the attention of the mams to the voice of religion, he uses the lanuge of the people-the Rnglish tongue; and is copious and often felicitous in his use of both Scripture illustrations and t}ose of common experience. The universities ad our bishops' eaminations mnight do much, but personal study and practice on the part of the clergy themselves'will do more to effect improvement in our general pulpit miniistrations, especiall if a longer probation for the full exercise of the ministry were required in the officeof the deacon, andif thislow/erorderwereextensively enlarged by the admission of men having good natural gifbs, sounda piety, and the knowledge of Holy Scripture, though not always able to proceed to a university degree. TEwe established church has no lack of learning (no church in the world has ever had so much but university learning evidently does not qai;bs for teaching the mas, and for this reason, among othersit makes the teacher use a sort of Latinized .Blnglhsh which does very well for the educated, but wthich the people do not understand. "I wonder," said King Charles tL to the learned Dr. Owren (upon hearing that he had been to hear Bunyan preach), " that you wvould go and hear that tinkrer preach, and you so learned a man." "Sire," said the divine, " I w ould give all my learning to be able to preach lie that tinker. Assuredly, at al events, the church could afford to give up a great part of her learning in exchange for the enviable atof attracting the people to church, and then securing their attention by suitable discourse to the great lesmons of our holy religion " in al1 things that pertain unto life and godliness." l have the honour tobe, Sir, Your oh,Alieu* -s JOSEPH HINdSkrxT.

A SHITVs ORC w STARvED To DxA -The insurance clubs of the north-est ports and the owner of the bark Palarmo, of South Shields, have received all the information that is likely to transpire of the wreck of that unfortunate vessel and the loss of her unfortunate crew and passengers, a portion of them by cold and hunger. The vessel belonged to Mr. John Cleuph of South Shiels and was commanded by his son, Mr. William Cleugh. She left lMemel in the middle of January, and besides her ordinary crew before she sailed there were shipped on board of her George Gibson, Joseph Bell, George Storey. and John Wislop, shipwrecked seamen, belonging to the Halcyon, of Hull, who were returning to England, passengers ; so that when she left Memel for England ahe would have from 15 to 2D hands on board. She pa2sedElsinore on the 31stof January, and no more was heard of her until last week. On the 14th of March a veesel, dismasted and waterlogged, was boarded off Norway by a pilot. Her decks were swept, and she was a perfect wreak, but on searching tho forecastle, and among the deals with which she wa laden, he discovered the oorpses of six seamen who, to all appearance, had perished of cold and hunger. The vesse wa subse. quently got to Battlen, 15 miles from Bergen and an attempt was made to diseover her name. The master and chief officers appear to have lived in a round-house upon the deck, but the sem that had swept over the unfortunato bark had washed away overyvestige of the house, and had carried away all tne ships papers and boats. Itwas therefore impossibletomake out the name of the vessel or herport. On one of the bodies, however, on English Prayer-book wa found, which had evidently been used by the poor mariner in his hour of extremity. Upon it was inscribed " James Bell, Slot-street, Hull, 1840.' A eertificato signed by the British Consul at Memel was also discovered u another of the bodies, which, from a correspondence that has taken place with that functionary, it Is PUt beyond all doubt is the same certificate granted to the shipwrecked men put on board the Palarmo beforeshesailed from Memel and that the waterlogged vessel is theunfortanate brkr. It is supposed that the principal portion of her crew was e--roet off her deck in the feaful gale that raged shortly after she passed Elsinore, and that, the provisions and other stores having been washed out of her along with the roundhouse, the poor fello fow d dead on board had perished of cold and hunger.

CHINZSZ zMIGRATION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMNS. Sir,-About a fortnight ago, while in Egpt, I happened to see In your paper of March18 a letter aigned " Thomas IL GLadstone," giving a most deplorable and heartrending ccount of the sufferings of Chineo emigrantawhile on their voyage to Cuba, and during their subsequent servtude ir Fthat isand; and concluding by expressing "exoeeding anxiety to know whether such fightful crimes and sufferig did not also prevail in the British West India possesciona" Now, Sir, I think that concluding pargrph oon. tains a somaewhat illiberal Insinuation, and as an employer of Chinese labour in Trinidad, and one who hs had opportuniL ties of obeerving the state of Chinese emigrants in Trinidad xs well as in Cuba, I deem it somewhat incumbent upon me take up the gauntlet which Mtr Gladstone appears to have thrown down to the Wet India proprietors I have had opportunities of seing ooloured and servile races under more vaid crumstane than have fallen to the lot of most men, as I have been three times in the West Indies, and have visited almost all -the British, Frenob, Danish, and Spanish Islandl. I have also been in the Bepublio of Venezuela, and twioe throaghout the length and bredth of the United States, in Bermuda, Madeira, the Cape Verd Iu.ndo, Sierra Leon,, the Cape Colony, Natal, the interior oountry beyond the Vaal River, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and RusBa; and amid all the modifications of freedom, apprenticeship, avery, serfdom, and avage. dom which I have witnessed ehere is nothig to oompare with the frightful oondition of the Cuban slaves. Even Mrs. Stowe's descriptions (which I oonsider exaggerated as regards the United States) fall fa short of the horxible realll in Cuba. I do not believe that such a state of matters existg, or ever did exist, anywhere else. I quite agree with Mr. Glad. stone, so far as my observation extends, that the state Of the Chinese coolies imported into Cuba nominally as free labourers is actually worse, if possible, than that of the slaves. They are sold by publc auction on their arrival, and they are worked, under the whip and the pistol, in the same gangs as the sives, for N7or 18 hours a-day, seven days in the week. They are penned up at night, hundreds of men together, like mules or oxen, in gaollike bhrracoons, and guarded by ferocious bloodhounds, kept on every estate for the purpose. I fully believe with Mr. Gladstone, that they are literally worked to death in a very few yean I Very different indeed is the state of the Chinese emigrants conveyed to the British colonies, for there, I need hardly explain to Mr. Gladstone, there is no such thing as "e lling emigrants by auction." They get good wages for eight or ten hours' work a-day for dx days in the week. They have comfortable cottages and gardens; hospitals and medical attendance are provided for them by law, and they go where they please, and work for whom they please, throughout the colony. It is found impossible to get a proportion of women with the emigrants, as it is oontrary to the law for women to leave the Celestial Empire, but the Chinese, I am glad to sy, ae beginning to intermarry with the Creole population.. InTrinida,dwe have found these people most useful andexcellent labourers, and I may add that theystand the climate there quiteas well as the negroes, They are also most contented, and being very i-dustrious people ae accumating money fast. With respect to the ill-treatment of the Chinese on their voyage to Cuba I know nothing, but I can safely aeert that this practice of converting them does not exist on board of shlpg chartered to convey emigrants to the British colonies. In 1852, while on a sporting expediition in South Africa, I inherited somepro perties in the West Indies, and being desirous of getting there with as little delay as possible I esteemed myself fortunate on my return to CapeTown inprocliringa passage on board the Hydrabad, of 850 tons, conveying coolie emigrants to Trinidad. Being the only white pasenger on board, and consequently somewhat at a loss for occupation and amusement, I frequently accompanied the master and the sur geonbelow vwhen they were making their rounds through the ship, andI also paid considerable attintion to the treatment and management of the coolies on board, and I am glad to say they were welifed, well cared for, and well treatead l every respect, and the utmost attention was paid to their health and comfort by the master and by the surgeon. The number of men, women, and chidren on board this large ship ws only 330, so they had abundance of room below, and they came ou deck whoerever they pleased; indeed, so trict are the regulations about their accommodation that I was informed by the masterthat if he had been conveying British soldiers to Calcutta he would have been allowed to carry a considerably greater number. Several of these emigrants had been a ae-on or two at the Mauritius, and could speak French, so that I was enabled to hear from their own lips that they were com. fortable, and well satisfied with their tretment They had also a very correct idea of what their position in Trinidad would be, and I can assure Mr. Gladstone that none of them were possessed with such frantic ideas as that "t there were rivers of gold" where they were going, any more than that there were "rivers of rum" and "mountains of sugr," asis said to have been the popular belief in this country in the early days of West India colonization. Their most sangaine expectations were simply that after working at good wages forfive ye rsthey would be sent back to their native country free of expense, and with a few hundred dollars in their pockets, which would enable them to pass the rest of their lives in comfort and independenoe Very many coolies, to my knowledge, have returned to the East with 400 or 500 dollsrs saved during their few years' residence in Trinidad; and I entertain little doubt but that many of my fellow-passengers (whotIme has just epire4) have boeen enabled to do so also. I trust I have been able tD satisfy Mr. Gladstone that the state of the Chinese emigrant in Trinidad differs Tery considerablY from his position in Cubs, and I regret very much that when so near to our West India colonies so accurate an observer should not have satisfied himself by personal observation of the facts of the case, instead of indulging in vague insinuations a to the probability of the existenoe OD the free soil of the British West Indies of the horrors and atrocities which he describesasM exising ins Cnba- conuntry where not only slavery, but theslav trado, ii floarlahing in full vigosr.

TO T2E EDITOB OF TEE TItES. Sir,-The writer of a letter agned " A Traveller," which Appeared in The Times of this morning, seems to be ino. rant of the fact that the members of the old clubs, mcn as White's, Brookee's, Boodle's, &c, are not the proprietors of the club-houses. There is in every case a proprietor, or landlord, to whom each member payvs n annual subexiption of 10 or 12 guineas, besides the price of anyJrefreshment tht he may take, obtaining in return the Bse of the houso, furniture, servants, &c. The members of one of these clubs have no more to do with the house, as a building, than the inmates of the Clarendon, or of Mivart's, have to do with the hotel as a building. The members of the now clubs, such as the Atheneumn, the Carlton. the Reform, the United Service, &e., are themselves the proprietors of the house and of everything in it. Great praise is unquestionably due to them for having contributed to the embellishment of London by the erec tion of the buildings referred to by your correspondent, but no blame is imutablo to the members of the old clbs for not having pulled down houses which do not belong to then even for the purpose of building handsomer ones on their site. Of the elevation of the Travellers, which your oorre. spondent criticizes, I wll only say that it is generilly ad. mired, mnd that Sir Charles Barry looks on it as one of his best works. I am.

A Nzw Usx Fyou TE FEmL SmX.-Our oorrespondent on board thelUnited Stated ship John Adams, in his letter published on Sunday, remarks that the natives of tho 'Marquesas Islands in the Pacific, with whom he had been saying, are in the habit of wooing the &Laest damsels they can find, wedding them, and then eating them up.

Every medicol man will vouch thit the flesh of female mammalia is less wholesome than that Of males. We fear the people of the aresa" st be injuring their health b their nwrholesome diet. The most curious feature in the business is that there is a large body of Christian misonaries on the islands, many of them from this country. We are not led to suppose, indeed, that these reverend gentlemen are in the habit of lunching off their tender spousev, nor even do we hear of their accepting invitations from the native chiefs to partake ef a nice wife ham, or a rasher of young girl broiled with breadfrit. But they are there, and from the popularity of these repasts it is evident that the missionaries know of them, and cannot prevent them.

Is it, Sir, absolutely nzcessary that every rare bird which unfortunatelv finds its way to our parks must be " stoned v or " kiUed ?; I suppose that some persons feel a pride in having such achievements chronicled in The Times. I hope you will allow me to say in The Times that other persons regard with disgust that brutal and idiot instinct for salughter which appears to be constantly aiming at the extinction of species. I am not a Manchester man. I have no objection to foxhunting, deer-staliang, or partridge-shooting, but I do not see why we might not now and then spare a golden eagle or a " female specimen of the harle quin duck, which did not even offer to fly when stones were thrown at her."

THE CANADIAN SBAT OF GOVERNMENT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As you appear disposed to ventilate the abovenamed subject, I trust you will allow me to confirm the opinions expressed in your columns this day by your correspondent "Ego." There cannot be the least doubt of the natural jelousy existing betweeu Upper and Lower Canada as to the selection of the site now rending. The objections to any situation on tho Lakes as long as Canada desires to remain an independent country are obvious, when it is remembered howv powrerful a neighbour she has on her border. The superior wealth and importance of Upper Canada give her a strong caim, if not to priority of choice, at all events to equality, when consulting the convenience of the two provinces, which would not be the case if Quebeo or Mon. tireal wFere selc^ted. This question engaged much of my attention when travelling in Canada, as I then clearly saw the evils of a moveable Government, and the distress brought upon Kingston by the total removal of the seat of Government from that city. At that time I had no conception of the question of a permanent seat of Government being referred to the Iome authorities, but the advantages of Bytown (now called Ottawa) were so obvious that in a workI published on Cuoa, trhe UJnid States, and Canada, three years aMo, I find the following passage, which will prove the impressions pro. duced in my mind on the spot * "No place was ever better calculated for the capital of a sreat count1.

CbTTON SUPPLY.--A numerous meeting of merchants and manufacturers was held yesterday after. noon, in the Manchester Town-hall, for the purpose of forming an association for the promotion of the growth of cotton all over the world. Mr. Cheetham, MP., wesided, and amon'the genUtleen present were Mr. adfield, M.P., Mr. .. Phillips, M.P., Mr. Bazley, Mr. M. Ross, Messrs. J. Pender, E. Ashworth, and J. sin son. Thechairman, in some lengthened observations, descri the present position and prospects of cotton cnltivation in all parts of the world whence it was now obtainable, and the urgent necessity for increasing the supply by the removal of all legislative impediments, and by every possible encouragement. Mr. Bazley, in moving the first resolution, said he believed no sonnd principle was violated by the formation of this association. Assuming a call of 61. per annum, though he did not anticipate so much as half that amount being levied, from the owner of a 40-hosi power steam-engine, for the purposes of the association, such a contribution would be pro tably invested in endeavouring to get rid of an 7zaction which must now amount in excessive crice of e raw material to 5,0001. par annun to that individual. (oear.) We were now paing not LUs than 10,000,0001. per annum more than should be paid for our cotton if the supply were unfettered. The resolution was for the formation of an association, to be called the Cotton S ply Association, to encourage by all practicable means th, owth of cotton in our colonies and other countries, by diffsing Information, supply of machinery, and every possiblhremoval of legislative impedimnents.

It appears that tile theatre was erected under the superintendence of the lat, well-known architect, Mr. Samuel Beazley, at an outlay of 50,0001., independently of the purchase of the land, which cost 8,000C., and it was added by the auctioneer that "no expense had been spared to carry out all that ingenuity could suggest from a thorough knowledge and experience of the requirements of this particular cla of building and to accomplish, for its size, the most perfect theatre in London." The pit will accommodate about 300 persons, and there are eight private boxes on the first tier; the first circle contains 18 boxes ; the seoend circle has eight private boxes, and sitting room for about 120 per. sons: the gallery wiU accommodate about 230 persons, and the slips 60. The private boxes are capable of containing four, six, and eight persons each, and the entrance to Her Myaestys box is most conveniently arranged. Ib was exPlaine by Mr. Robins that the scenery, curtains, and theatre fittiagg, looking.glassee, chandeliers, the wardrobe, and all articles usually denominated " properties," were to be taken by the purchaser at a fair valuation.

];rA3W BPOBT. cotmT nvEflr7 ArN,u - PAnX v- o!nnume (Before thc LoBD C01O -f= LORD JUSTS of A a LORS JUTICE IMS'sWaS an appeal froM a decree of' Vice-Chancellor Stuart. The bill was filed for specific performance of a parol arement entered into by the defendant to grant the laintiffaeleae for 14 years of farm. at Milford, near Saliaury. It appeared that the plaintiff was let into possession of the farm on the 3d of January, 1855, upon an agreement, accrding to his allegation that he was to pay 21. IOL per are for the 200 scres of ;Wich the farm was composed. The draught agreement containing the terms now sought to be enforced were not formaplly aproved by the defendant untLI the 12th of Febrry l5, and. this occurring after the plaintiff was in possession of the farm afforded ono of the grounds of opposition to'specific performance. The contention, however, on the part of the plaintiff was, that the draught terms had been in the defendant's posession for some time before the 3d of January, 1855, and that the possesson given on that day was in pursuance of such agreement. One of the gounds of defence was an allegation that the cultivation of the land by the plaintiff bad been so injurious that the Court would not enforce specific perforniance of an agreement to grant a lease, in which a forfeiture had sl-ready occurred by breach of the covenant. The evidence, however, on this point was of a conflicting caracter, nor wa there any distinct testimony that the draught terms had not been in the defendant's possession from November-, 1854, the date of their being reduced to writing by the plaintiff's solicitor. The Vice-Chancelor made a decree m conformity with the prayer of the bill, and ordered the defendant to pay the costs. The defendant now ap~ andMr. TowNszie, as it was an appeal from the hole decree, opened the plaintiffsa c ase. MrBacon, Mr. G. . ird, and Mr. Toulmin appered for the appellant. CThte ILoiu C1Th?NCxLtOR delivered the judgment of the Cout,an sad hequestion raised by the bill was entirely one of fct. After a careful consideration of the evidence, he had no heitat in comi to t nusion as a jury. man that the defendant put the plaintif i o"f the land on the 3d of January, 1855, having C.edocumet now sought to be enforced in his bands at the time, and that the terms therein expressed were those upon which he put him into possession. What took place in the March following, when the defendant formally approved the draught agreement, was merely an acknow ledgment by him of the terms on which he had let his farm. 'There must, therefore, be specific performance of that agreement, and the defendant must pay all the costs. As to the question whether there had been a breach of the covenants, that must be decided by a court of law. Appeal dismissed with costs.
VICE-CHANCELWWnaITTRv A-- r. o1 ISANBY V. TRrWlR (Before Ftcd- ChancaUor Sir W. P. WOOD.) The Court was occupied during the whole day with the opnng of this case, which is a suit instituted by the p ntif, a labouring gardener at Louth, In Lincolnshire, claiming to be entitlea to very large estates in the county of -Northumberland, which have been in the possesdon of the defendants or their ancestors since the year 1783. Mr. Rolt Mr. WiUcock, Mr. Warren, Q.C., and fr. LocoIk Webb appeared for te plaintiff; the Attorney. General Mr. Cairns, and Mr. Toller for the defendant. The plainti's case is not yet ooncluded.
COURT O0 QU1JES'S RIN(14T W C- A. A - BUSINESS OF THlE OMT. JUlmngs tn Banco, before Lord CnABEr, and Juiicu WIGHTU. RRT,F_ _A. %9 E In Tne Course Of the day, Lord CAMPBELL sid, it would be for the convenienoe of the bar to state that the case of " the Queen v. the VioeChancellor of Oxford," which stood at the head of the Crown paper would not be taken to-morrow (this day), but, border or t Coui, it would be postponed till next term. Lordship observed that in the rating of public buildings the Court had a sort of leIlative power, and it was therefore necessary that there should be a fuU Coart ; and, as Mr. Justice Colerndge, whose presence was desired by the Court, could not attend till next term, the case would stand at the top of the Crown paper for Trinity Term The Court this day took the cases in the speca paper. THE VESTRY OF ST. PANCRAS V. M5ORGAN. This case came before the Court upon a demurrer to the declaration, which raised the question whether the action wouldlie. The pLalntiffs were the vestry of St. Pancras, and they sued tho defendant to recover the amount of contribution to which he was liable under the local act, the 6th and 7th of Victoria, in respect of repairs doneto a carniage-road adjoining property of which be Xr. M. SmrraE, Q.C., on the part of the defendant contended that the action oould not be sustained. It was a general principle that where a new obligation was imposed by satute, and a special remedy was provided, thatremedy must be pursued, and an action would not lie. In the pre. sent case it was enacted that the expenses were to be paid by the owner of the property, but where he failed they were to be paid by the occupier, and deducted out of the rent. Where the occupier made default, the vestry could levy the amount by distress on the goods of the occupier * but it.,was provided that the occupier should not be required to pay more than the amount due for rent. Mr. D. D. KRA-,ex (with whom was Mr. Quain) contended that under the 6th and 7th of Viesori and the several sections of the 57th of George II, chap. 29, the vestry had the power to bring an action for the amount due; and that this remody against the owner was likely to be more effectual in procuring the necessary funds thah the unoertain and dilatory mode of obtaining it from time to time, by driblets, from a migratory class of tenants. Lord CAIPBE said he was of opinion that the action could not be sustained. It was a general principle that when by Act of Parliament a new obligation was imposed, anD a special remedy was provided, the party who wlqhe to enforce the obligation must pro. ceed by the special remedy. Here an entirely new obligation was thrown on the owners of houses to pay for the repairs of the carrnge-way, and a special remney was provided. By the 86th section the expense was tobe paid bythe owner within 60 days after notice, and in default t was to be recovered "as hereinafter mentioned." The 87th section went on to say that it might be paid by instalments: and then the 88th section enacted that in case of default the amount might be recovered from the occupier, and, if necessary, by distress. There was then a proviso that the occupier should not be required to pay more than the amount of rent due. Thus a specia remedy was provided. His Lordship did not think at this was a "ratW or "assessment" within the 57th of Geore III., chap, 29, o as t be recoverable by action. Upon the whole, his Lordship was of opinion that, s there was a new obligation imposed, and a special remedy was provided, that remedy must be pursued. The action, therefore, could not be sustained, and judgment must be given for the de- blr. Justice BREme Was Of the same opinion. Judgment for defendant.

Mr. MAUDE now moved on behalf of the plaintiff to set aside this verdict, and for a new trial, on the ground that the damages were insufficient. The action was brought by executors on the covenants of a lease of a mill and premises at Chertsey for dilapidations and for rent. The premises had been allowed to get out of repair, and had been surveyed by two architects on the part of the plaintifii, one of whom assessed the sum required to put them in proper repair at 1271, the other at 119h They had also been surveyed by two persons on the part of the defendant, one of whom assessed the damages at 694., and the other at 631. 15s. Asum of 7 was also due for rent. The jury bad not divided between the sum claimed by the plaintiffs and the sum which the defendant said he ought only to ray, but had assessed the damages at half what the defendant said he ought to pay, one of the jurymen afterwards saying. as their reasou, that they thought that the defendant looked like a respectable old man, and that they had therefore found for him as they had done. The damages found were quite insufficient to put the premises into a proper state of Tre BLORD CmsE JusneC said, if the defendant would consent to pay the lowest sum at which the damages were assessed, the Court thought the plaintif ought to agree to acceptthat. If not, the Courtthought justice had not been done, and there mustboe a rule siis for a new trial. Bat the pro. posal the Court suggestEd should be made to the defendant, and the Coart would vr'hbably hear no more of the matter. Rule ni.si accordingly. TXTLEY V. EASTON. This was an action for an alleged infringement of the plaintiff's patent for " improvements in machinery for raising and impeling water and other liqnids." At the trhi before 3Mr. Justice Willes, without a jur, it was ured on behalf of the plaintiff that by two disclaimers he had reduced his claim to a means of increasing the action of a centrifugal pump by causing the liquid to enter the wheel on both sides. The defendants contended that this invention was not new; that as long ago as 1835 Mr. Hales hadmade and sold pumps and propellers on the same principle. At the trial a verdict was directed for the defendants, leave being reserved to move to enter the verdict for the plaintiff. A rule having been obtained, Mr. Knowles, Q.C., Mr. Hfidmarch, and Mr. Macrory on a former day showed cause against the rule M r. Collier Q.C., and Mr. Chance now appeared in support of it. The CouRT took time to consider its judgment. CAM1PBELL V. CORLEIY. In this case, it will be remembered, the defendant Corley had been secretly married to the mother of the plaintiff. an old ladyupwards of 80 years of age, and, upon'the death of the plaintiff's mother the defendant took out administration, and also instigated certain persons to file biUs in Chancery against the plaintiff and his trustee, claiming to be next of kin to Mrs. Cambell, upon the gpound that the plaintiff was an illegitimate son. The plaintiff afterwards brought an act1on against the defendant for malicously, and without probable grounds, instigating these suits, and also laid a claim to compensation for being, compelled by the defendants wrongful conduct to file s bill against his own tIrstees to enforce his right, and on the trial at Guildhall in Trinity term last a verdict was found for the plaintiff Wmill 7001damages.

Mr. IL Chambers, Q.C., aud Mr. Joyce appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Hawkins for the defendaut. This WAs an action brought by the plaintiff, as widow of an old man wno had been killed by a horse belonging to the defendant, to recover corn sation for the injury which ahehad sustained by reasonorher husband's death. About 20 of the relatives of the deed were joined in the action, but, as it appea that no one but Mrs. Blakehad in truth suffered pecuniarily from his death, the learned counselfor the plaintiff su ted to the j that they should give the sum of 11. as dges in respect of that portion of the claim, and that they should apportion to tie widow the substantial sum which they might award. The facts of the case were ry simple On the 12tn of January last, about half-past 4 il the afternoon, M1r. Blake, a man 74 years old, was crossing St. John's-street, Clerken we, when a horse belonging to the defendant, who is a grooer in theneighbourhood, which horse was trotting quietly down, a a policeman who was caledsaid, "wmth the intention of being harnessed to his cart," knockedhim down. He ws carried first to a publichouse and then home, where he was put to bed, and eventually, onthe 2d of February, died. There appeared to be no doubt, although it was not strictly proved, that his death wa caused by the accident; but as the sargeon who attended hir, a Yr. Whitton, was caled on his subpeena and did not attend, his absence was commented upon with great effect by the learned counsel for the defence. It seemed, too, that the deceased enjoyed a pension of a guinea a week from the Carron Company, in Thames-street. Mr. EAWEINS, in his speech to the jury, urged that no proof had been adduced that the death of the plaintiff's husband had been occasioned by the negligence of the defendant's sezvant, who was running alongside the horse at the time of the accident; that Mr. Blake had himself contributed to the accident - that it had not beea proved that he enjoyed any pension to which he had a legal claim; and that no medical man had been caled as witness for the plaLintiff. Mr. Justice Winraass having summed up the whole ease most caefully, Tne jury found a verdict for the plaintif dmages 50l., to be allotted thus -491. to the widow, Uf. to the 2urelatives, according to tbe provisions of the Act. The remainder of the day was occupied in trying an action of trass brought by a retail aoeesemonger against a Wholesale cheesamonger, the details of which were toally without intuest.
COURT OF EXClMEOlURR Thrqn&v Av.- 01 Trnmnq - - (Siings in Banco.) Mr. EDWIN JAmS, with whom was Mr. Lush, showed ase against a rule to dischre the defendant out of the cwtody of the Sheriff of Berkshire, upon the ground that he had been illegally arretd on a c. a at the suit of the plaintiff The affidavits on which the rule was obtained showed that the paty b; whom the arrect had been effected was not the officer to whom the writ was direted, that person being at the time of its execution some 24 miles distant- and, seCondlY, thatthe arrest in itself was Mlegal by reason'of the howse of the defendant having been broken open in order to gain accss to the defendant. In answer to &ese affidavits others were now read by the learned oounsel for the plaintlff giving in some respects a different version of the mode in which the house of the defendant had been entered from that given by the defendant himself; but not denyng that the offlicer to whom the writ was directed, and by whom or in whose presence alone the same could have been legally executed, was absent. T he COUT, therefore, without calling on the other side, rrade the rule absolute in its terms. Mr. JAMS hoped that the Comrt would ihnpose terms on the defendant, and prevent him from bringing any aciion. The COURT could not do that unless by consent. .r, HOGoiNs, with whom was Hr. Huddleston, for the defendant, said that he could not enter into any terms. Mr. JTAs.-Then, the rule will not, of course, bo made absolute with costs. The COWuT.-No; If the defendant will agree not to bring an action he can have the rule made absolute with costs; otherwise it must be made absolute simli4ter Mr. HOOGI&-The rule wzas moved without costs, and that is what we wish for. The CounT.-Very well; the rule will be absolute as prayed. Rule absolute accordingly. WEBB V. VarGHT. Mr. Bovm moved to review the taxation of costs, on the ground that the Mster had allowed too large a sum to the arbitrator for his fee under the circumstances of the case. It appeared that the arbitrator went from Brighton to Hastings to hold the award, and that he arrived at i o'clock, when he had a view of the premisPe snd terminated the reference at 3 o'clock, no evidnce p ving been adduced before him. His fee was 40 guineas rhereabouts, and was made up of three days, at 10 guineas per diem, 5 uneas for the view, 3 guinem for drawing the award besides the costs of stamp and stationer's bill. From this ccomunt the 3Mster had struck off 10 guineas for one day ; but it was submitted that even then he had allowed too much for the arbitrator's fee. The COURT granted the rule ri
ARCHES' COTTR.T TlPnV AV A -- 91 D3NISON V. D1TeLr (Befmv. Xr.TnTmnn-nQn? I 2ne argments in this case were resumed by Dr. Sprns following Dr. Bayford on behalf of Mr. Diitcher. The ADMnAVPY ADvocAiT, in reply, said it was without precedent that those proceeding against a clerk should be unable to make up their minds as to which date to fix upon as the commencement of the proceedings. His learned friends could not make up their minds whether to select the date chosen by Dr. Lushington, namely, the notice to appear before the commissioners or the service of the articles. It showed tht the case was involved in the greatest obscurity. It was not true that everything had been done by the party promoting the suit vwhich might have been done. No proceedings had been taken between the 10th of January and the 5th of t, 1855. It had been said that when a suit was brought to this court by letters of request charges might be introduced which were not lid before the commissJoners, but that was not correct. According to Dr. Bayfiord's position, when the report of the commissioners was filed it ws uncertain whether the suit had commenced or not, because he said that if the suit went to the Court of Arches, then he admitted that the citation was the commencement of the suit; whereas, if it went to the bishop, then the notice to appear before the commissioners was the commencement. It had been further conter,ded that the service of the arcles was the commence. ment of the sit. The articles themselves were silent except as to the offence, and were dead in law until the party charged received a notice to appear before the Court. The accused person could not answer the articles until the notice had been served upon him. It was said that the I! oceegs were preliminary-preliminary to what ? Wny, the institution of a suit; andif preliminary to the institution of a suit, how in common Cigc and common sense could theybe the commencement of a suit ? Though he (the Admiralt7 Advocate) had thought it his duty to press this objection, and if he were unsuccessful in it he might press others, yet it was only right to his client to say that he obtained with reluctance his permission so to do, because his cient was satisfied that when the merits of the case came to be examined, not only would he not be found to have contravened the artidles of religion or to have shown disloyalty to the Church of which he was a member, but if any dout could be entertained upon it, the subsequent discovery of Bishop Guest's letter showeed that, whether his construction was the correct one or not, it was an admissuble one. Dr. D PAx having also been heard in reply, The learned JuDGE said that he would deliver his opinion on the point argued on Thursday next.

He said he could explai the matter. He decined to give his ad. dress. 'Wites searched him at the sttion, and found U sovereigns on him.

Anrow inquired whether the person who had chargedthedefendentl assaultinghim, as described, was The constable re lied that he wu not. Mr. AnyoLD asked whether the defendant was intoxi. cated ? The oonstable thought not. He appeared then as at the present moment, and his impression was that he was of unsound mind. Mr. ARNoLD felt there was too much reson to fear that such was the cae, and remanded the aocused until this day, in the hope that his friends might come forward, or that thscolice might learn something about him. Heis escriled as a surgeon. Benjamin RichLzdson, Thomas Woodworth, and Emmanue Barker, the first two pries of the Soot Fusileers, and the latter of the Col ima=uGuards, werecharged witha series of despte taaults and serious conDficts with the police It appeared from the lengthy evidenco adduced that Richardson conducted himself in A very offensdve manner in the rvate passag Of MrC.

Hathway, seeing the imminent peril her huband was in, seized the belt, when the defendant strack her several blows about the hewd with his fists. The police rere sent for, and Richardson taken into ctody, hen the other defendants and a third sldier, not in custody, came up and attacked the police. An indescribable riot ensued, in the course of which the soldiers took off thedr belts, and after a serious Sh,r Richardson was rescued, but wa subs uently appre dinthenihorodhe e beeqeny henued in eighbourhood. The other two defendants having taken shelter in a publichougo the police waited out. side til a guard was fetched from the Wellington baracks, whither they were taken in custody, and produced at this court yesterday. On their way to the brracks Woodworth rushed away from the guard and again asulted the police. Richardson pleaded drnkennems as an excuse, and the others said it was altogether a nmsake respecting them, as theyThadnot left the publichouse for hours before the guard came in and took them. mr. AnxoiL observed that this was one of the most sEriOUs cases Of the kind that had ever oome before him. As Woodworth and Barker wa they were innocent, he would remand the case, to give them an opportunity of bringing evidence. He, however, remarked that Barker was proved to have aaulted the polioe on his way to the barracks. WOQSE?PSr r.--Willam Wicks, a thick-set bargean , was charged witx the following scandalous out- % Fanny Badcos^k, landlady of the Marion Arms at Hackney, whose head was bandaged, her voioe almost inaudible from exhaustion, and who was obliged to be seted and supplied with water during her examiiation, stated.- On returning home on Saturday evening I notioad some very improper oondugt going on between the prisoner and somae women who were standinR in front of the bar. I had noticed the same conduct between tbem before I went out, and now expressed my surprise to my husband that he should not have checked it. The prisoner used some disgustng language, and asked me what business it was of mine. I had not spoken to him, but now told him he had much better go home to his wife, and threatened if he did not dedst to tell her of his behaviour. The risoner on that called me two most dieputahble epithets, anudfeeling exaerated at them I thrl ath pint pothd inmy hand, but which did not strike him. He then called me by more disgusting Appellations, and I threw another pot and a tin can at him, but neither struck him, and, if they had, they couldnothxvehurthim. Iwasthenturningtoenter the bar-parlour when the prisoner seized a quart pot, which was standing on the counter with some porter in it, and lung it at my head with such force that it cut m temple open. I staggered gainst the bar, felt myself instantly oovered with blood, and on reaching the honse of a neighbour entirely lost my senses. I bled very much and was taken to a surgeon, who dressed the wound, but I still fel very weak and exhausted, and intend on leaving here togeo, to the hospital My husband was present all the whie, but did not interfere for my protection, as the prisoner and he are always together. SergeantTownshend.-Her husband treats this woman very badly, and has himself been charged with asulting her. He is not here now, and said he should not trouble himuself about it, and that he wished the prisoner had killed her. On her being conveyed to the surgeon's he said that the temporal artery wa cut through, and that it was surprising the woman as not killed on the spot. He could scarce y stop the blood, and thought erysipelzs was likely to supervene. Mr. DEYNCOURT.-.A she wishes to go to a hospital, let it be so, as it may be better for her, but see that she is conveyed tnere in a ctb. Williams, 102 N.-I was called to a house in Pritchard'srow, where I found the complainant smothered in blood. I told her husband, and he said it served her right, and that it would be a- good job if the erisoner had kiiled her. I then went to the house of the prioner, who looked out of window, but refused to open the door, and upon my threatening to break it open wore he would shoot me. directly after heard the noise of a ramrod being forced into a gun, and a female voice saying, "For God's sake don't." I thought it not safe to ent*,hbst watched outside, and he promied to surrender xkftizq, if I erns for him. Sergeant Townsben&--I akwjard got admitted by an old lady and took the p ws who idmitted the assault, but said the prosecutrixs hd attacked him first, and that he was intosicated. In the room I found the gun I produce, which I believe to be loaded, but cannot get it unscrewed. Powder cormes out at the nipple, and I can feel the shot, I think, with the ramirod. John Ravaling, a labourer, gpve a similar account of the transcion, but said that one of the pots throw^n by the prosecutrix struck the prisoner on the arm. He was standing about nine feet from her, picked a pot up, threw it at her, and it struck her on the head in such a manner that " she bled wonderfully, all down her bosom and on to tbe counter. She appeared not to know what she was about after that. Procutrix was in a passion when she th the measures at the prisoner, which she did one after the other - but, of course, a woman could not throw them with such iorce as a maun." A certilicate was put in from a surgeon named Morgan, describing the inunries received by the prosecutrix, who was conveyed from the oourt in a cab and the prisoner was remanded til that day week, with liberty to put in substantial bail, the m9lstte at the same time giving directiens that the woman e husband should at the n examination be in attendance. CLERKXNWEL.-The sitting magistrate requested our reporter to acknowledge the receipt of the first half of a 51-note, No. 96,718, from Peter Pickwick, for the poorbox, an acknowledgment of which was requested in this journaL.

NOTES ON THUCYDIDES.* It is not so lon1' ago since Mr. Cobdeli made his celebrated compsxiAson between "all the volumes which ThucydVies had ever written" and a single nnumber of thiX journal. The reult was, of course, eat in C,ur favour, and the public may have mesgined titat in this coutntry at least Thicydides a doub,ed up for all future time, after the manner of that no less celebrated sheet of paper in which, Ps in ' figure, the same hon. gentleman crushed the p,ower of the Russian empire. But, though Sebas'topol has fallen, the mightof the Muscovite is still mcknowledged from the shores of Nova Zembla to 'the Caspian, and, notwithstanding the withering sarcasm of Mr. CobdeN Thucydides seems to be endowed with a strange vitality, for he has once .more reappeared before an Englisn public in -the excellent edition of an Oxford scholar, Mr. Sheppard. The truth of the matter is, that were Mlr. Cobden's zntellect as much distinguished by breadth and com.pass as it is by force and intensity, he would have been able to perceive that both The Times and !Thucydides occupy their own place in the republic -'of letters, and that each of them occupies it with credit to itself and benefit to the world. .A man more liberal, and, because more liberal, -more wise than Mr. Cobden, the late Dr. Arnold, 'himself an editor of Thunydicles, has explained the reason why:- " The peried to which the work of Thucydides refers belongs properly to modern, and not to ancient history. The -state of Greece, from Pericles to Alexander, affords a poli"tical lesson more applicable to our own times, if taken all together, than any other portion of history which can be named anterior to the 18th centary. What is miscaUed -ancient history is the really modern history of the civiliza'tion of Greece and Rome." It would be easy to illustrate and confirm this statement, but our readers will, perhaps, take the a*uthority of Dr. Arnold for the fact-the man, .perhaps, of aU his contemporaries most fitted to pronounce a judgment. Thucijdidest then, we may presume will continue to be read despite the disct7m of Mrx. Cobden, and we will venture to say that !he reading would be accompanied with profit to some of our legislators and litterateurs. We should be delighted to believe that no greater nonsense will ever be talked upon the sutbject of "capital punishment than is to be found in the admnirable speeches of Cleon and Deodatus. The principle of non-intervention is not likely to receive mnuch better illustration than is to be found in the policy of Pericles, the reckless aimrs of Alcibiades, -and the folly of the Sicilian expedition. The " right of the strongest," that good old principle cf freebooting morality, has seldom been argued with more -'ffect than in the Melian Conference; and if lessons of warning are required, and Communists would learn what phenomena of social life are likely to be exhibited when the fountains of the great deep of society are broken up, where could they more fitly read the records of an actual experience than in the far-famed pages which depict with such painful fidelity the results of the Corcyrian Sedition ? :For these reasons, therefore, we repeat Thuteydides -will be read, and, if he is to be read at all, we are constrained to admit that he should be read not in the spirit of journalism, but in that of thoughtful and accurate scholarship. He hlimself has told us that his work is a " possession for oever," and, though we see that Mr. Sheppard objects, and with reason, to the accuracy of -the translation, we presume that he has no inclina'tion to dispute the fact. We are glad therefore to perceive that thoughtful and accurate scholarship .x8 the distinuishing characteristic of Mr. Sheppard's -work. No difficulty is passed over; everything appears to be carefully weighed, and the reason -asigned for every decision. Even in those cases where the reader may not assent to the conclusion -at whichtheeeditors have arrived he cannot but admit that it has been elaborately formed. No oppor-tunity is lost for inculcating general principles, and -the editor more immediately responsible for the -scholarship appears to be a very decided disciple of Professor Conington, or rather of the doctrines laid -down in his inaugural lecture by the learned Pro-fessor respecting the right method of editing a classical author. Due credit is assignedto allprevious labourers in the same field, both English and foreign, and a very full acquaintance with the late German literature of the subject is evinced. Of .-their most distinguished predecessor in this country, 'the late Dr. Arnold, the editors speak in tetms of gratifying respect, though they admit that in the strictly critical portion 'his work is deficient. It .would be injustice to them not to state that in this particular their volume exhibits an immense advance. Nor have Dr. Arnold's own speclaliMs of geography and history been neglected. They seem to have written up to the existing state of knowledge on these subjects, and are therefore in a position to contribute information wnich was beyond -the reach of the most able and industrious editor 25 years ago. We wish well to this edition of Thucyddhles and .ahall look anxiously for its completion. Mr. ShepLard is a gentleman of varied accomplishments, and .bears a high reputation at Oxford as a University preacher, and in other capacities. The present work -must certainly add to his reputation for industry, '-.iscrimination, and scholarship. Ble appears to have selected a worthy coadjutor, and where there is so .nuch merit on either side let both divide the palm. Partnerships are not generally, to our tbinking, -very successful. We remember some time ago the *programme of a "C Christian edition of the classics," -by two distinguished gentlemen, wherein one was 'to furnish the scholarship and the other the piety. Neither rose to a very great elevation, and we scarcely admired the effect of a p?pyrnreas pannuties ,of moral sentiment glittering among the sombre patchwork made up from Bentley and Orellius. The present editors must avoid anything of the kind. We fancy that in, parts of the second book 'we discover some meagreness in the "strictly critical portion," and some portions of the first are less full in geographical detail. Let us also impress upon -them the value of a carefully constructed index to the whole. * NZots nz TiucydidY,, by John G.

FAILURE OF THE MAINE LIQUO? LAW.-There was once a time, and that not many months ago, when to 'doubt the complete efficacy of a Maine Law as a cure for .'drunkenness was sufficient to arouse the indignation of a sertain class of temperance reformers. To our mind the idea of putting down intemperance by legal compulsion seemed -from the first one of the greatest delusions into which even Brother Jonathan had ever fallen ; and all who tra-elled in the State of Maira im the days when the prohibi*ion law sa in its pristine vour bore testimony that it -Was systematically evaded, and had only introduced a system of organized and unmanly hypocrisy. Every year, of ,course, tended to break down even the external observance ,of tbe Act, and in proportion to the restraint which bad for some time been imposed on the drinklng habits of the people seemed the excess in which intoxication was at length openly indulged. The failure of the hlaine Law is now admitted and proclaimed by an authoTity who willUcarry couviction into the minds even of the 2nost determined abstainers, Mr. Gough, the oelebrated ,teetotal orator, in a letter rcceived f rom him a few days -Ago, says, " The Maine Law ie a dead letter everywhere," and adds that " more liquor is cold than I ever knew before in Massachusetts, anL in other States it is about as bad." :In the same letter -Mr. Gough speaks of " the present universal failtre of the law to produee the desired results." ft is to be hoped that this bitter bid salutary experience of tte American temperance absolutiswill havesome effet upon a similar pwty in tbis country. The Forbes Mackenzie Aot was a Maine Law in a sllsai way. It was in the estimatijn of many of its supporters onlr the first step toa snore complete ne"sure. That Act is rapidly going ihe way of its exsiuplar in the Uuited States, and it is to be hoped that the admission of Mr. Gough tvil he the effect of disposing many who have hitherto defea4eol it tooth and ea4 to a timely relaxation of some of its provisioDs. Regulation of the traffic to come extent, of conrse, titr must always be, but it is vailL to expect the spread of temperance and the formation of 4ober, manly habits, or sasuyhing more, indeed, than mere extornal order, from legal reerictions or police arraDgements, It is to a different instrtapentality altogether- namely, to education *nd to moral and religious culture, that we must Ieelk for a zeformation of the abbts of the people; and we wuind entreat the tempsranen xeformers to throw themselve3nniM.rvedly into the ms,ovement for the improvement, the icrease, and extension of schools, and the diff,ssion of in. .elJPctual attinnuents and eojoj uus.ts among the masses of Ca pSeppl,~ 91ow Ytai

Lionel Gisbormes C.E., respecting a design for the embankment and: improvement of the Thames of which he is promoter, and on a memorial from Messrs. Loder, Jackson, and Bird, the promoters of an wnudertaking for the "1Formetion of an Emabankcment on the North Side of the Thames, between Southwark andi W.estminster-bridges, and for the construction of a Rtailwzy and other Works." The foilowing is the report of the committee: 11Your Coosmittee have to rpeort that, in compliance with the In. structiona of the Bo&Td, conveysed to them boy the reslution of the 4th ofApril, Isis IND. 23). referring. lo them a communication, from Mrr.

Loder, Jackson, and Bird. the premotet Of an umdertaking for the, 'fomation of an emank. ment on the north side of the Thames, between Southwark and Westmtnste bridges, and for the construction Of a ratiway and other works,' ttsey have attentively considered the wnitten statements ad. dressed to the Board npon the subject of the above schemes, and have carefullyexamine-d the plans, setions, and drawings which have been laldbefore them. Mr. Giaborno has also attended them, and, in addition to the informatiou contained in his written exposition, has entered into detnllod explanations on the subjent of his design, and oral extianations have also been furnished by Mr. Bird with reference to the other scheme under consideration, Before examining the main features of the two mea-ures wbhic have especially engaged their attentioni, your Committee deem it tin. Portaus to define certain IeadngobjeotE6 to which they consider that every measure of Tktamies embankment should be mqainly dlr,,eted They ar of opinon that the embankment of the Thames should be carried out withx reference to the following objects : "L To improve the Thames as a navigable river, having dna regazd to the safety of exisiting bridges "2. To IncreAse the 'wharfage accommodation, aud improve the means for the shipment aud delivery of goods. "3. To improve the Thames in a saniitry point of view. "4. To remnedy the present unsightly condition of the banks of the ThAMes, and afford facilties, by means of architectural embewtsinnent, for improving their appearneo. " 5. To open upsa new thoroughfare between the eastem and western parts of Louedun. " 6. To facilitato the coostrmction of a low level intercpting sewer. "It Is estential that your Committee should point out to what extent both or either of these schemes referred to accomplIsh thes objects, and I,,r that purpose it becomes necessry briefly to describe their leading features. 11It is proposed by the plan of Mr. Gisborne to build qutay walls on both tides of the Thames, the effect of which will be to confine the waterway of the riTer to a width of 700 feet, the width sanctioned by thieBoard ofAdmiralty for the new bridlgeat Westminster. For the accmmodation of the present wharves, floating bas:ns wil he coDnstructed of a minimum width of 100 feet, to be providedK isth enirances to admit of theifngveesand egress of barges and o ther craft, and to. remain open at least three hours each tide. " On the ground obinine d by fillIng In, to a height of four feet above hIgh-water marlk, between the river wall and the fleeting basins, certain works are intended to be constructed on either side of the river. "The quay wall on th e Middlesex Bide is in extend from Wesinsin. ster-bridge to Londo2s-bridge, and wil be 21 feet above Trinity high. watermark, to avoid the necessity of drawbridges over the entrances to the tidal basins. At that love I and as far as St Paul's wharf it Is Intended to hars a covered esplanade for foot passegers The esplanade will be next the river and 20 feet in width, along which the ground for 00 feet back will be lot for building, except at particular points, where buildings would be objectionable, such as Whitehallgardens, the Temaple, do. It appears by the drawings anid report that the buildings are intended to be 70 fort above the esplanade and 91 fort above Trinity high-water mark. Parallel with the esplanade, and extending from Hungerford-bridge in London-bridge. it is proposed to construct a. railway. "'Next ths railway there Isto bea gtreet, Tarying from 90 to 40 feet in width, commencing at Westminster andtermlnaticg near St, Paul'; which street is designed to pass under each of the present bridges and have approaches to the main thoroughfares. "The remainder of the embankment, having an average width e'f about 65 feet, will be lot for building ground, sultable for large stres do, Capacious cellars are proposod to be form ed under the esplanade: railway, and road, which will connect the river with the stores next the floating basins, and ar intended re afford facilities f or unloading barges. " QpoosIte Whitehiall, the Temple-gardens, do., and In other parts, the quay wall is to be built only four feet above Trinley high-water mark, and the esplanade, railway, &o.. are to be carried on columns 25 feet apart, eo as not to exclude the view of the river, or interfere with existing wharves beeweon a polIat near st. Paul's and Londonbridge, and for this distance an additional width of about 40 feet will be added to the presentwharves. 11On the turrey side the quay wail is to extend from Lambeth Palace to London-bridge. for the greater part of which distance it wil be about 21 feet in height above Trinity high-water mark. "Next the river a road 70 feet wide will be formed, alosjg which the ground is to boe appropriated to the erection of large stores, shops, &o. " At each of the bridges lilai proposed to divide the road inito two; one half forming an approach to the bridge, the other accommodsttrg the through traffic and psasing underneath. "Ceilaro simailar to those on the Middlesex ride. and appropriated to like purposes aro to be constructed under the road onL this side of the river. " The promoters of the plan stain thst it will afford peciular advantages for the construction of a portion of the low level sewer, formiog part of the scheme of mainx initercepting drainage on the north side of the river. "1It is stated that the works can be executed for lees than £20,060,0, and it is calculated that the annnal ground-vents of shops warehousor, wharves, do,, w-ith the receipts from the railway, wil amount to £10O3,030. "The promoters offer to apply to Parliament for a private Bill enabling them to car.y out their objects, if this Board will guaanutee them 4 per cent, uponL a capital of £2.000 000. secured on the Metropolitan rates; the guarantee in take eflecet only or. the completion of the works, and to be limited to making uD a net revenue equal to 4 per cent, upon £2,000,00, In case the revenue derivable from the ground-rents and railway should prove insufficient; the enjoyment of the ground-rents by the comPany to be limited to 00 years, and half the surplus profits beyoud 5 per cent, to be handed over to this Board In furtherance of public improvements. "The objects ot the Thames Embankment and Railway, eas appear by the statem3ent signed on behalf of the promoters end by tbe explanations of Mlr. Bird, are to construct an embankment and other works, comprising floating and tidal decks on the north gids of the Thames, between. Southwark and Westmimter bridges, and to form a public road and footwvays to be carried ensa viaduct alo ng that part of the embankment betweeni Whitehiall-place soid Char iug-croes, and Chathamn-place, Blsckfrlars having oosamunjoations with come of the streets leading out of the Strand. It has also for its obJect the laing down of a railway, at a low level, within tho line of embankment from Queenhithe, nea Southwark-bridge, to UMebancter-buildings, near Westminster,brldge.; and aqueducts are in be carried over the railw,ay, to ailow of the ingreess of craft from the river. The plan originally included an extension to the Greycoat EHospital, near the new Victoria-street, to join the WestMinster Terminuns Rtaway; but, In consequence of the abandonment of a large portion of the atter scheme by its promoiers, letIs understood that this part of the under-taking Is relinquished or suspended, " It Is urged by the laromoters that an interceptiog sewer might be advantageously erected, In counexion with theo works of the embankrmont, at a gre.tly reduced cost, as the dams which must necesamrily be used for the constructionx of the embankmenat would. for a considerable portion of the distance, be available for the construction of the sewer. " The estimate for the contemplated works Is £583,770, and the promoter, look to the railway as the source from which their profits are to be derived. "With regard to the first of the conditions al,ove suggested-namely, the improvenient of the Thameis as a navigable river, having regard to the safety of existing brldges.-your Committee have to observ that neither of the schemes referred in them exactly coincides with the line of embankment laid down by Mr. James WValker, and which litli understood was approved by competent authority ; but they are of OPinion that, provided the width of waterway be not diminished below that now existing at the narrowest part of the river, a little above London-bridge-viz.,700 feet-the variations in the designsebefore them are not suach as iujurionsly to affect the navigation. "It may also be elated that by the line laid downx by MTr. Page, and approved after long examination, by a6 committee of the HEouse of Commnons, it was intended to narrow the waterway of thxe river to a greater extent than Is proposed by either of the schemes whichb have been referred to your Commnittee "As regards the criterion soel up by the second of the above conditions,-namely, increaaed. wharfage accommodation, Improved means for the shipment and aeliveryv of goods, and the means of acoers for barges,-they consider WaI. Gisboeme's plan superior to that of Hessrs. Bir, Loder, atnd jackson. Th: asn or deck sbsown on the latter plan are deeper than th =qudct hich lead to therm, a feature which the committee regard as objectionable ; but as cash of the scebmer before the Board contampla-tes the covering of the mud banks, they would, In this respect, both bebIeneficilalInsa sanitary point of viewv. "With reference to the fourth condition, that is to Fay, the improvement of the appearance of the river banks, it Is in be obgerved chat, as by Mr. Gisboeme's plan it is prop'eed to erect building!s in somae n- stance 91 feet above high-water and 70 feet above the esplanade, your Committee consider that this would involve ass obstruction to tightand air, and form an objection to Mr. Gisborne's planwhich does not apply in the plan of tlessrm,Bird, Loder. and Jack-son Both schemes, in proportion to their extent, satisfy tne fifth condItiou-namely. the opening up of a new thoroughfare between the eastern and western portions of the metropois, " And both schemes present equal facilities for the sccomplishment of the sixth object-namely, that of facilitating the construction of a low level intoerepting sawer. " Your Committee think -it necessary to add, that, in their opinion, the promoter3 of each of the desisns under discussion have prejudiced the efficiency and value of those deig ns as werka of public utility by seeking to render them commercially remunerative; an d they consider that the public advantage should be the primary object Ina workof such maguninde and of so pecuUlar a character aa the embankment of theThame3. All which your Committee submit for consideration. J. THWAITMES BENJAXIN DIXO()N. JOSIAE WILKINSON", Mr. WRIGTr said it would he in the recollection of the rnembers of the Board that two schemes on the emb inkment of the Thames-one from Mr. Lionel Gisborne, C.E., and another from Messrs. Loder, Jackson, and Bird-had come before the Board about six months ago, and these schemes had been referned to the Conmmittee of Worksband Improvements for their reports. Beth these plans hi been before Parliament, and the promoterr of them werea about renewing their application, but Her Majesty's Government had recommended that before doiFsg so they. should submit the plans to this Board for its approval, considering that the Board ought to have -A voice in carrying out this great improvement. He ,tought that the Board ought to he very much o-liged to Her Majesty'a Government for having taken that c0urse. The committee had carefully examnined both p)us, and had drawn up a report so amnple that, he.need qti nake any observations upon it. That report 4ad been Wit pff from tume to time in consequence of more urgent blipe,es, but ia consiidering it the committee had -laid down six general principles which they believed iyere of the Vtn)ost importance in dealing with this questionL In the first in8tance ;hey considered that any plan which miglt be adopted should havo for its chief object to improve the Thames as a navigable river, having due regard to thq safety of the existing bridges. The scondobject-wasto increaso the wharfage accoamodation and imnprove the means for the shipment and delivery of goods. He felt assured that every one wbo was in the habit of passing up and down the river must be impressed with the convictoit that the present mode of receiving and transshipping goods 'was anything but satisfactory or desirable. A number of piles were also driven into the bed of the river, which were advanced day by day, and were at all times very objectionable. The next object was to improve the Thames in a anitary point of view. As to the fourth proposition, he thought it would be little short of sacrilege to interfere with the banks of the Thames. unless they couLd improve its architectural appearance. Iet them recoUect the beautiful buildings that were erected on the banks of the river at Paris, andthen consider what could be done onthe banks of the Thames if these improvements were carried out. As to the opening o. a new thoroughfare between the eastern and western paets of London, this embankment would form a roadway for heavy traffic in that direction t a trifling expenoe compared with the widening of the Strandand Fleet-streetor Oxford-street. The last proposition was to faCilitate the construction of a low. leve[ sewer. He had always advocated the formation of such a sewer past St. Paul's, so that the buildings there mightnot be endangered bysewerage works. Itbehoved the Board to carry out the sewerage question, and by all mens in their power to force on with it the Thames embankment. He concluded by moving " that the report of the committee be a prveL" r. B. DIXOX seconded the motion. Mr. LXsiE disapproved the plan of the committee, be. lieving, as he did, sat it would be better to let the thing alone. He had lately received the report of Captain Burstall, and, having read it, he found that at the very place where there was the greatest scour in the river that was preciselythe spot where Mr. Giaborne and other "tinkerse wished to narrow the stream. AlI such propositions, he considered, were founded on erroneous calculations and inperfect information, and as an iRustration of that he might refer to the state of the river Clyde. Engineers bad been torturing the flow of that river for 90 years, and the original width was 450 feet. It had since been narrowed and dredged, but it was now proposed to extend and throw back the banks of the river Clyde to what they were 100 years ago. Mr.Leslie then read a lengthycorrespondence which had passed between hini and the Lord Provost of Glasgow and the engineers of the works on the Clyde on this subject, which, he contended, justified him in opposing any similar embankment of the Thames. Mr. Bnnro v said, if he understood the main question, it appeared to him not to require much discussion at that stage. The report of the commnitte did not approve any particular measure for the embankment of the Thames, but sugested whether certain features should be considered ntue first instance. Mr. WARE thought that the report should be referred back to the committee, with a request that they should consider it in connexion with Captain Burstall's report. He hould move that as an amendment to the original motion. Mr. Hows seconded the amendment, and thought it would be very desirable foir the Board to have before it the result of that investigation. Mr. TuRNER said that, although he had not received the report, he had seen an abstract of it in the newspapers, and he believed there was nothing in Captain Burstall's report that would render it necessary for the Board to pos4ne its decision upon the report before it. The report ofCaptain Burstall set forth the increased scour of the river in consequence of the removal of old London-bridge, but neither of these plans would tend to increase that scour. They would keep the water at a more regular and uniform depth, and they would have as much water as they had before. He hoped the Board would carry out the report of the committee. Major LYOy said, having received the report of Captain Burstall, he could say that there was nothing in it to prevent the Board from coming to a decision as to the report that day. Mr. Deputy HARRiSON said he felt satisfied that it was possible to embank the Thames, and the expense alone had prevented proceedings for that object being adopted. Ea was firmly convinced that it was possible to embank the Thames, and at the same time to improve the navigation. As to the state of the river Clyde, he had been up and down it several times, and he was prepared to assert that the embankmnent of that river had been highly successful ; and, although it was proposed to set back the line of the river to its original width, that was not through any defect in the embankment, but had been rendered necessary in consequence of the greatly increased traffic to the city of Glasgow. Therefore he strongly supported the resolution. Mr. OrFop said, as this question had been before the committee for a whole year, he was therefore opposed to sending the report back to them. The C(Ar iN2 put the question, when there appeared, For the amendment - Against it ... 25 Majority .. .. .. ... 22 The original motion was then pub and agreed to. Mr. WkiGnZT then moved- "Tbata the control of the banks of the Thamestovestedinthe (rown or the corporation of London, or both of them. Her Majesty's Government and the oorporation of London be immediately cocnunucated with to ascertain It tboy wil undertake to carry out the embank. meset of the Thames between Westminster and London bridges, or if they wil loin with this Board In carrying out the earne." Mr. WILaXnsoN seconded the motion. Mr. Lusui opposed the motion, believing the Government had nothing to do with it. The CHcAimTN put the motion, whieh was carried by a majority of 17 to 1. A discussion then ensued on the alterations proposed in the bylaws, but it was devoid of public interest. The following finanoial statement was Laid before the Board:- 3alance in hands of treasurer, 13th April, 1857 .. £3 301 3 5 Checks drawn, but not presented .. .. 1,073 16 5 Available balance .2227 7 0 Amount of deposit account. 65,000 a Total general balance . . £7,227 7 0 Some routine business was then disposed of, and the Board adjourned.

THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK. TO THE EDITOBi OF THE TIME. Sir, -I have just seen your paper of the 18th, in which there is a speech by Mr. Roxburgh in the Court of Bankruptcy, in which be gives details of an alleged conversation which his client, Mr. Frond, states that he had with me. I lose no time in stating that this pretended conversation is a pure fabrication. It is from beginning to end an entire falsehood. I had no conversation of any sort whatever with Mr. Fraud, of whose existence I had no knowledge till I saw his name in your paper; and if be ventures to make such statements in an affidavit, I shall take such proceedings against him as I may be advised. I am, &c. H. D. MACLEOD. Apnl 2U. The following is the statement complained of:- " Air. ROXBURG}I.-Yes, Mr. Crafurd. Mr. Froud called again on Friday before the bank stopped, and saw the manamng director, Mir. Macleod, who told MIr. Fioua tbat he had been connected with the bank from the formation of it, and handed a printed balance-sheet to him, which was said to represent the true state of the affairs of the bank. Mfr. Froud said he would take it with him and consider it; at the same timae he said he heard that they were about to make another calL Mr. Macieod said, 'No; they would never make another call.' Mr. Froud aluded to the application for shares, and Mr. Macleod stated that as soonx as they were at the lowest, the directors were about to buy them all up (a laugh), and that they would rise as fast as they had fallon (laughter); and, as a proof of that, one of the directors had purchased shares at 401. per share the Friday before the bank stopped. As Mr. Froud was going from the bank, Mr. Macleoa took him by the hand into the bank, and asked him if he wanted to buy upshares (laughter): andthatoneof,thedirectorshadbought shares at4OZ. ner share and that person might go to a broker who had shares to sell. Mr. Frond unfortunately did so. These are the facts which I shall prove by the evidence of Mr. Froud, as the circumstances under which be took the shares in the bank. I shall also ask you to use upon this proof the evidence that has been given in this court by Mr. Esdaile and by Mr. Apsley Pellatt in reference to the affairs of the bank at the period to which this proof is directed, and then I shal ask to be allowed to prove for a sum of 5001., as money had and received by the bank of Mr. Froud. on the ground that he has been induced by fraud to take the shares, that the contract is wholly void on she ground of fraud, and that Mr. Froud is entitled to recover back his money. That is the evidence I propose to give to'day-the evidence of Mr. Froud, Mr. Esdaile, and Mr. Apsley Pellatt. With reference to the drawing account I apprehend there will he no difficulty. Aks to that, I apprehend the assignees will make no difficulty if the amount stated is correct. Under these circumstances I submit that Mr. Froud is entitled to prove for the amount of the 5001. received by the bank, and I need not call your attention to the cases wichhaveheld that where a party has been induced to take shares in fraud he is entitled to recover back the money he paid for those sh That was decided in the case of 'Watner v. Sharp,' 'Burns v. Fennell,' and several other cases."

THE CONSCrsIPTIo2Tr IY EGYPT. TO THE EDITOR OF TE[E TIMES. Sir,-Until the ambitious career was checked on which hfohammed Ali entered after having won the position of Vieeroy of Egypt, the drarghts which he relentlessly made on the population to procure soldiers for the prosecution of his schemes was such as seriously to cripple the resources of the country, and are stili remembered by the people with dismay. It is natural, under any circumstances, that a conquered race, long governed by a military rule, without the slightest approach to kindness or conciliation, even if they are too heavily burdened or too deeply degraded to think of systeinatic resistance, should, not without many a pang, allow the flower of their sons to be dragged from them by force, and added like so many cattle or chattels to the possessions of their oppressors If this be a natural phase of such a system in its ordinary application, how much the more as referring to the time of which I speak, when the lot of the Egyptian soldier was bitter indeed, and when once torn from his friends he was from that moment lost to them forever, without achance of theirlearning aught of his fate beyond the miserable certainty that he would perish in thovs Syrian wars where life was so prodigally thrown away, in which they could have no interest, and the very object of which they knew not? It is not surprising, therefore, that the fellahen, should have regarded being iacluded in a levy as the greatest possible curse; and so inveterate was then their repugnance to be impressed, that young men and boys by hundreds had the forefinger of the right hand cut off, or an eye deprived of sight, so as to render them unfit for military service-practices not yet altogether disused. The present Pasha, whose strongly manifested desire to increase his troops, and his lavish expenditure upon them, have induced an outlay which it is now found necessary to curtail, has greatly ameliorated the condition of the soldiery. They are now wel paid, weU fed, wel clothed, and, I am assured, well treated. StiL the people are not less reluctant than before to be obliged to furnish men for the ranks; and although those who ar aeized are said after a short time to become reconciled to their new life and to enjoy its superior comforts, every effort of ingenuity is made by bribery, where practicable, or otherwise, to be saved from the dreaded -Nizara. This, no doubt, is in a great measure owing to the existence of feelngs such as have been alluded to, to the sad recollection of the past, andto the complete isolation for life from home and fiends which impressment is still, although not necessarily, held to imply; but it is very clear that another very suIL cient reason presents itself in the harsh preliminaries for procuring recruits oonstantly enacted before the whole country, which are calculated to arouse hatred and distrust. It is not likely to be enticing to successors that the conscripts when chosen are chained together like gaUley.slaves, and so sent down the river in crowded boat loads; nor is the step which immediately precedes this more alluring, for the clumsy arrangement of assembling for the purpose of selection all the men within certain ages, at, to many, the distant capital of the woidiredh in which they live, often requires compulsion, which is unfortunately put forth in a most ignominious, not to say cruel manner. As an illustration of this feature in the life of the native Egyptians, I may describe what has been occurring here within the last few days. It happens that the Pasha, who has lately disbanded a considerable force, has ordered a small number to be raised, to conist of the best men procurable from the districts in which the levy is to be made. The M1fooderah of Esneb, a large tract of country, has to furnish, it is stated, 200, and of these the proportion that fails upon the village immediately surrounding this house is one. In order, however, that this one man may be selected, all between the ages of 16 and 20, amounting to upwards of 50, were commanded to repair to the town of Esneh, a distance of 40 miles. Last week the time for their departure arrived, and a smaU party of askar, a sort of military police, if the name be not completely degraded by applying it to them, came to see that they went. These askar are chiefly Arnants from Albania and Ronmelia, or Turks, or half-breeds, in which the blood of either of those races is the preponderating element-and, search where you will, more ruffuanly looking fellows wiU not be easily found. Nor is their appearanee belied by their deeds and character. They are unhappily alowed an amount of license in their treatment of the peasantry whieh a eonquering army in a hostile territory might well be reprobated for exerCsing, and the cqwardly manner in which they bully the helpless people, defying simple rights of property, caunot but excite one's -indignation. Were the Government firmly so restrain their excesses, or, better still, to sweep them from the country, substituting in their place a more creditable constabulary, the fedaheen- would be relieved of one great curse, the retentien of which, however subduing to the governed, it can hardly be argued with reason is essential to secure internal repose. When the party of these ask-ar, or soldiers, five in number, approached the viUage, the majority of those who had sons of the prescribed age fled with them quietly to the mountains, or concealed themselves in the inmost recesses of the larger tombs, arranging that their wives or other relatives should bring them food and water by night. As soon as the soldiers arrived the Sheikh of the village was required to set about his duty of collecting the young men and boys specified in the list drawn up by the authorities from clas. sHied, but apparently inaccurate, enumerations of the population which they possess. By the end of the day he had gathered together nearly 20, and four or five women, the mothers or wives of others who had fled, and they were all placed in a sort of guard-house for the night, under charge of the soldiers. About S o'cleqk, when it was quite dark, the moon not having yet risen, and light douds obscuring the usually brilliant stars, a fierce msaie' suddenly arose immediately outside our courtyard. Guns were fired, men were yelling defiantly, women screeching, and dogs baying. In an instant the gate of the yard became the scene of the row; one party, as the noise seemed to indicate-for it was impossible to see from the window-having rushed inside, shutting the door in the face of the others, and holding it fast against their thrusts and blows. Conceiving the cause of the I whole to be that some of my workmen, wvhoa the soldiers wished to seize, had taken refuge in this heedless manner, we went down to insist on a more pacific arrangement, or the transference of the fight to other ground. The assailants, however, had already retired and the assailed were maklng the best of their way out with the greatest alacrity. I then and subsequently learned that the squabble was of an entirely different nature from what I had supposed. It appeared that about sunset the Sheikh had gone to the house of a man named Baroor, in his absence, and brought away two of his sons. Baroor, who probably intended flying with them to the Desert, was indignant on his return to find them gone, and thought himself peculiarly insulted by the Sheikh having kept them as prisoners in his own house, instead of placing them in the regular manner with the others wbo were similarly circumstanced. Accordingly, he coUeeted his brothers and cousins, to the number of twelve or fifteen, and came to attack Sheikh Lasum, who lives in a range of tombs close to the wall of our courtyard, and who, chancing to be passing at the time with some of his friends, was driven inside the gate in the way I have mentioned. The guns, which belonged to the Baroor party, were fired more to strike terror than to do aetual mischief, and indeed only one charge, as I have ascertained, contained a buUet, which was fired in the air; but there can be little doubt. as in fact the leader avowed to me, that some against whom I I 'fancy he had an old enmity, or who in any case are hated ax al shWkh-bedld, are, in consequence of their swindling. extortionate exactions, would have been kiUled if opportunity had offered in the moment of anger. But, although the expedition happily failed to accomplish the revengeful object in view, it had another effect which probably was not contemplated. The soldiers who were established at the gnard-house, about 50 yards off, no sooner heard the shots and the struggle than they shouL dered their muskets and decamped, leaving their prisoners to take care of themselves, who instantly fled to the hills Nextmorning the discreet gaolers returned, accompanied by the governor of the district, the Kasheff, who sent a messenger to inform the fugitives that if those who were ordered to go to Esmeh, did not come back, and that within 48 hours, their cattle and sheep, if they possessed any, would be seized, and their houses given up to be spoiled and pillaged by the soldiers. With hardly an exception, this brought them all down from the mountains, and the threat was not put in execution, as it had been in several instances in an adjoining village. Wishing to see in what manner it had been carried out there, I went next day to one of the houses, as if for another purpose; and, although the whole place was not by any means reduced to ruin, there was every evidence of rapine in a small hoard of corn strewn upon the ground, a handmill broken in fragments, water and other jars, almost the only furniture-if the word is .applicable in a fellah's dwelling-smashed in pieces, and every little mud-built keepingplace rifled, and its door -burst open or torn from its fastenings. A sight like this was nufficiently melancholy, but what could be thought of the sore and swollen hands of the wife and sister of the owner of tbe house, who, in consequence of his having concealed ismself with h£s sons, were beaten with a stick, not simply ,n the cowardly anger of tlew soldiers, but in presence of the Kasheff, on the savage principle that, to save them the. pnen would come and give themselves up. With regatd to the feelings which proceedings of this kind are likely to exdte, while reason and humacitv are equally shocked, it is only fair to remember that oms. thing ought to be allowed for, the 'bharacteristic unconci. liatory ppirit of Eytern rule, and that it may be said with some truth of the people of Bapt that long centurie of serfdom have deadened their nen8ibilities and produced a degraded nature which rendeis them difficult to m&Wge without strong compulsion. But, with whatever justice it might be urged that it ih necesry to deal with them firmly, it is impossible to witness without abhorrence the mode of procedure employed by the executive in cUes like that described. On the day the young men set out for Esneh the villae was left nearly empty, for their fathers and others of their male relations went with them, while numbers of the women followed for a short distance. It had been promised by the Kaheff that the disobedience which they at first contemplated should be overlooked in the event of their departure within the given time; and it had even been arranged that the night attack of the Baroors was not to be mentioned to the Moodir; but, when before him, one of that party inmau. tiously accused Sheikhi Isum of bribery, who recriminated by telling what they had done, which opened up the whole story, and secured from two to four hundred strokes with the stick for nearly every one of them, except the leader. When the controversy began he adroitly saw to what it might lead, quietly withdrew from the divan, and got fairly away ere his name was cailed for punishment, Nor having escped at the time, will measures be taken to call him to account again, extraordinary as it seems, after tha Others have sffered so severely for an act undertaken at his instigation. The order of the oonscription had, of course, reached the Kasheffl and so had been mado known to the people some days before the occurrenoe which I have described. In the interval I had earnest prayers from some of my workmen, beseeching me to do what I could to save their sons from being taken; but I could only mak-e one reply-that I would not interfere in the matter at all. .1 was satisfied that I could not do so with justice, and I also felt that even if I had desired to exert any influence in individual cases, it would havo been most unbecoming for me to attempt to obstruct in their ordinary ourse the operations of the Govern. Xnet, as I could only have done so in consequence of possesing the very authority detived from the Government itselL For nearly similar reasons the foregoing narrative might be regarded as ungracious, and with some justice, were it supposed to be the text for denouncing a Government firom which I have received, it may be as an official affair, the facilities of a Firman It i, of course, impossible for any one familiar with a better state of things not to regret that any portion of mankind should be ruled with such deep forgetfulnessofthefundamental principle, that the endof all government ought to be the production of the greatest amount of happiness to the governed; and it is equaUy impossible not to see that a vigorous recognition of this truth on the part of the legislative power in this country would reform, it might be with some difficulty, an unprincipled and corrupt executive under which the People are crushed down. But these are questions with wbich I wish to have nothing to do, and I merely proposed to exhibit an episode in the life of the native population. With regard to all countries, the condition and manners of their inhabitants form one of the most interesting subjects for illustration; and if in the description of features of this kind a Govern. ment should appear to disadvantage in its dealings with its people, that is its own affair. If any reprehensible system on which it acts is deliberately adopted as part of its scheme, it cannot complain of publicity, neither can it expect secresy if unprepared to defend its procedure ; for the open details of the internal policy of a country are the property of all.

THE WASHINGTON EpIDBEIC. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The account in yoar paper of the Uth inst. of the recent epidemic in Washington city and at the National Hotel may be made most instrzxctive if rightly considered, or-as there maybe disputes as to what is right-if the points named are discussed. With your leave I purpose offering some general remarks on the subject. To do this I must quoto pretty liberally from the account as published. The city of Washington gener ally, but the National Hotel in particular, were visited with the epidemic. "The disease was diarrhcesa of an unusuaUy obstinate type, ccompanied frequently by severe colic, always by marked and sadden prostration, and generally by nausea and other symptoms indicating exceeding weakness and sensitiveness of the stomach." "- The disease first made its appearance in January, at a season when gaiety and dsipation in Washington were at ful tide. The hotel was full, containing some 400 or 500 guests. The building is old-fashioned, awkward, and not well arranged for comfort, convenience, or perfect ventilation. Frequently the guests complained of the foul air in the passages during a foggy day. StiL, sccely aybody thought of fearing an epidemic as the result of any apparent cause." The several theories of poisoning I wil not discuss. Disease in excess, in any form, has generally been attributed to poison at all times and in all countries, from the earlest historio periods to the present day. The poison doctrine is most ably disposed of in tbis case. The defective sewers' theory is no doubt the correct one. It is stated that : "The sewerage of Washington is generally very good. The main sewer, however, ranning by the National, has very little fell to the canal, which is the common receptacle of the sewers' contents; much solid deposit entering the sewer remains there until a flooding rain washes it out. These deposits evolve large quantities of mephitic vapour, which, of necessity, must escape somewhere. In former years it escaped by the gutter openings into the sewer, placed at the street corners. Last autumn these were modified by the insertion of stench-traps, which prevent the escape of the noxious vapour into the streets, and compel it to seek other outlets. This it finds ordinarily, although with difficulty, at the point where the sewer debouches into the canal; but when the outlet there is closed, there is but one other direction in which it can find outlet, and that is by the house connexions with the sewer into the hotel itself, where it poisons the air and sows the seeds of disease among all who are subject thereto." "A high tide" or " a freshet" closes "the mouth of the sewer ' a south wind blows directly into the mouth of the sewer. There had been " high tides," " freshets," and " strongsouth winds" during the epidemic period. The conditions underwhich the epidemic prevailed appear to have been as in the order narrated- L The season, January or mid winter, with variable weather and extraordinary changes of temperature. 2. Much gaiety and disipation in Washington. 3. Four or five hundred people at one time occupying the National HoteL 4. The National Hotel is old-fashioned, awkward, and not weU arranged for comfort, convenience, or perfect ventilation. 5. A main sewer from the city of Washington runs by the National Hotel, has very little fall, empties into a canal not far distant, contains stagnant refuse deposit ; the mouth of the sewer is at times blocked by water; at other tumes it is open and the south wind blows direct into it. ARl the street gulles had been trapped the autumn previous to the oubreak of disease. We have here in these five statements the principal conditions connected with the epidemic as detailed. The facts relative to the water are not noticed, as it is quite clear the water supply, however defective in quality or otherwise, cannot be made to bear the blame. Bad water should, if possible, be avoided, or improved by filtration or by boiling, and water which "relaxes the bowels of aU strangers going to Washington" cannot be good. This the Washingtoians -will no doubt look to in time, and they should also consider that bad water may be rendered worse if collected, stored, and distributed by defective apparatus; good water is greedy of impurities and is rapidly contaminated If exposed to foul substances or to the action of foul air. The conditions, as given, may be recapitulated, and I then propose to offer some general remarb not only applicable to Washington but to other places. The season when the epidemic now under consideration broke out was mid-winter (January). There was much gaiety and dissipation. The city, and the National Hotel in particular, were crowded, the sewers had been trapped, and the outlet had either been blocked or exposed to the indraught of a strong south wind. The sewers contained foul den,y,t. kpidemics appear to obey no easily recognized general law. Cholera rages under the burning sun of the tropics, and amid the ice and suows of Russia and the north of Europe. Pop,ulation in crowds is the only constant single necessary condition for excessive mortality. In the swamps and jinglesof India the arid plains of Asia and Africa, the heights before Shobastopol, or in London, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, Paris, Copenhagen, &c., epidemics rage. The first condition is people; all other considerations of stratification, climate, season, course of rivers, and temperature are very subordinate, as may be shown, and one of the remedies much advocated (sewerage) can have only a partial effect. In Glasgow and in Copenhagen exoess of ease (fever and cholera) is found to prevail in the attics; in London and in Liverpool, on the low levels and on the ground floors, or in cellars. The attics of Glasgow and uopenhagen, and the ground floors of London and Liverpool, house masses of the poor. Sewers and drains may improve any place, but can have little beneficial effect on rooms 50 feet above the surface. Less crowding, better i ventilation, and general cleanliness are required here. Washington cannot be " well sewered" for the following reasons:-The sewers retain deposit, this deposit gives off foul gases, the outlet is most objectionable, the gulies have been recently trappd, and we are not informed that any adequate means oft ventilation had been adopted. To trap foul sewers is a delusion and a snare; trapping does not diminish the gases generated, but it may force them, in geater volumes, into houses, if connected by drains. m winter, houses connected with foul drains, foul sewers, and foul cesspools are liable to become more unwholesome than in summer; as the in-door temperature draws the foul gases with the force of au air pump from the foul drains. An inner temperaure of 70 deg., with an onter teniperature of 30 d&g., gives a Aifferenoe of 40 deg.; and as warmiair is lighter than cold air, tbere Isarush from the externid totbeinternxa byevery crack andcranny.

But we are acquainted with certain oonditions which agvate epidemics, which add strength and fatality to th& sbrtlepoison,whateveritmay be; and ourch,misted6* certaln electric and other changes during tCe prevalenice c epidemics. It Will, however, be fatal to prtgreu, as itwiil be contray to facts and truth, to attempt to fasten he6lera to any one cause, or to say that any one set of means will, prove a remedy. Bad water is no doubt unwholesom%e, huthe worst water does not produce cholera Foul sewers a injurious to health, but the foulest ewers have exied foryears without generating choler Defective ventilation destroys health, and medical men say confined air, bre and rebreathed, produces fever and cholera. Thi m true; but how is it that cbolers is independent -of and all of these causes? And how is it that likecauses do not in al cases produce like resuItg?' The answer may be difficult, but that is no reason one. 'should not be sought. So far as our experience yet goes, - may safely'say that low and wet ubsoil, foul sewers, high rate of temperature, overcrowded rooms, and defective ventition, tend to produce disee in excess at all times, and to giTe strength to any prevailing epidemic; but we, have no evidence to prove that they create an epidemic, or that their removal will prevent an epidemic The life orman is in the atmosphere-the ordinary atmosphere, as we know it. Certain terrestrial conditions may tant the atsnosphere and render it unwholesome to breathe, or its tenperature may be above or below the medium ol robust health. here temperature the reason nd instincts of m may guard aggainst, but that subtle something which from time to time gives an epidemic char cter to the breath of heaven may neither be accounted for nor controlled Thee remarks ae e only thrown out to prevent rash conclsons, hasty works, and subsequent disappointment. Sani works are recommended at present as the be-alland' endalthey are not. Sewers and drains are necessary, but ventilation and many other things must not be neglected. Sanitary works on a grand sale are contemplated not only for the British metropolis, but also for other citie* throughout the civilized world; great mistakes may be committed, as expensive works may leave much evil untouched., Take London, for instince; plans involving an expenditurof millions of pounds sterling are before the public; if passed, they will be years in completion, and may never befinished. All the great sewers opening into the ames. have open mouths, up which the winds blow, driving foul gases into the streets, courts, and houses, to the injury of the health of thousands. A few hundreds of ponnds would remedy this evil, but the Board of Works lack the r ca} coommon sense to do it. Again, ventilation of foul sewers and drains is necessary, the only ventilation provided is at the surface of the streets, over which the traffic passes, andt where by diffusion the subtle and foul gases may do most harm. There is not one ventilating shaft specia;ly provided with gas consumers in the whole metropols. These workci might be done at once, and cheaply. W ith regard to the recent outbreak of disease at Washington there can be little doubt but that it arose from * concurrence of causes-foul sewers not ventilated externalto the houses, overcrowded tenements; gay living, whichmeans excesses in eating anD drinking, with broken rest;. variable temperature, probably wet feet and wet clothes neglected, and an epidemic atmosphere. A water which is injurious to strangers must be injurious mare or less to the residents, and would have its share in the nischief. The remedy will be-sewers of an improved character, with a better outfall, protected from flooding and the ingress of wind; full and free ventilation external to the houses; full and free ventilation of all hotels and dwellinghouses ;'and, if possible, water of a purer character should be supplied. AU waterclosets should be against outside vwalls, having full and constant ventilation from and to the external air. Watercloset drains and cesspools within buildings must be injurious. arge hotels, old and defective, wi1l ever'be liable to excess of disease if overcrowded.

MR. LAYAnD'S FAnpwEuL ADDRESS.-Mr. Layard,. in his farewell address to his late constituents at Aylesbur baving referred to the severance of a Political connexion of nearly five years, says,-" It naturally grieves me to find that majority of theelectors have pronounced me no longer worthy to represent them. I should grieve still more hadI reason to think that their confidence had been withdrawn on account of any neglect on my part of their interests, or of any vote of mine in the House of Commons. I may assume without presumption that the result of the recent election in to be attributed to other and far different causes, and that it affords no index of the true feelings of a majority of the eonstituency. Together wisth many other men known aw the ablest, the most independent, and the most truly Liberal representatives of the people, I have been deprived of my seat in Parliament. It behoves the Liberals of Aylesbury, as it behoves many other Liberal constituencies, to reflect calmly, now that the excitemeent consequent upon the dissolution is passed, and to inquire whether too much has not been sacrificed to a MLinister who has been invariably op. posed to every measure of true reform, however moderate, and has ever failed to justify the confidence of those nations which have trusted in him for the support and defence oE their liberties. Responding to the appeal made to them by Lord Palmerston, the constituencies of England have removed from the roll of the House of Commons many of those historic names which will be as landmarks in the annals of our country. To effect this result every means that the influence of Govcrnmentcouldcommand have been. brought to bear. It is no dishonour to suffer vith Cobden, Bright, Gibson, Clay, Cardwell, Otway, aud a host of others, who have ever been found on the side of the people, and. have been intimately associated with almost every recent measure for enlarging their liberties or coentributing to their welfare. I cannot believe that this state of things wi long continue; and I feel convinced that when the country ha recovered from the delusion into which it has been betrayeeZ the very exclusion of these men will lead to important. results, and will mainly contribute to the success of the cause of progress and reform." CmRUFSs EAUGRANTS.-Copies of commiunications to or from the Foreign-office and other departments of Her MAjesty's Government on the subject of mortality on board the ship Duke of Portland, carrying emigrants from China, have just been published by order of Par* ment.The Duke of Portland sailed from Hongkong with 330 (not 500) Chinese emigrants bound for Havannah, and 130 died on the vovage from fever and suicide, the remainder (200) having been safely landed. A rigid inquiry into the circumst?nces was instituted by the Government. Another vessel, the John Calvin, lost 122 out of 297 colonists. No blame attaches to the masters of either vessel; both thip,s had experienced surgeons and ample accommodation. A fatal disease manifested itself on board the Duke of Portland, and soon became epidemic. The causes of the sickness are traced to the quality of the tater, andpytothe smoking of opium in excess The Local iarine Boarat (Cornhil) re unanimously of opinion that no blame attaches to the owners or captains, or to any one connected -with the ships. It appears to the board that the mortality on board the Portland was much aggravated by the great beat and unusual leDgth of the voyage (150 days), causedby the sailing of the ship in an improper season, one month, at least, later than she ought to have done-to enable her to get down the China seas. The Chinese emigrants gave much trouble on board; they made frequent attempts totake the ship, and the captain never lay down in bed without a cutlass at his belt. Mr. D. Ludgat, the surgeon the ship, states that a low typhoid fever was generally pI, valent among the low class of Chinese, and was brought oa board by them at Hongkong. The sickness was attributed. to improper food used by themselves, such as onions amd pickles. The habits of the Chinese were very filthy. The coolies died from debility and affection of the liver and. lungs, and exhaustion arising from the seeds of the disease. The disposition to commit guicide Ta most romirkable. An explan ation has been demanded from Sir J. Bowrng by the Colonial-office relative to the number whicha the above vessels were legally qualified to carry. THE DpxP SPA FISRENG.-It is a remarkable circumstance arising from the network of railways that nowintersects the kingdom that fish is nearly as dear in the towns on the Tyne and Wear as in Birmingbam and othez inland towns situated a considerable distance from the se ; the fact being that those latter towns are connected by ralways with fisbing communities employed in the deen sea fishing; whereas, Sunderland, Shields, Newcastle, and the other towns in the county of Durham and Northumberlnd depend for their supplies principally upon the fishing zi ages on the coast, whope inhabitants, with scarcely ar, e_ception, fish only some 10 or 15 miles from the coast in smal cobles, and who also, in rough and stormy weather when the winds blow from the north and east, are unablefor veeks to pursue their avocation, and idle and stve oh tho shore. The Dogger Bank is about 60 miles frms the Northumberland coast. Upon this bank there iv an inexhaustible supply of large fish, such as hiig and cod but the ground cannot be fished, exoept by large dkegi oabt, which, of course, with the necessary tackle, are aeme. what out of the reach of the Northumberland and Durikm fishermen.
