FORBBIGN INTELLIGEYCE. FRANCE [A p6tVou of the following appew"d iE our second ediUOnffSitnr: v-1 rizOM OUR OWN COB03SPONDRI;T.) yFAA , .tIDAY, NOV. 20, 6 r.x. M.. Fould's visit to London is supposed to have reference to other objects besides the financial crisis and the situation of the Bank. The Minister of State may confer with the Governor of the Bank of EnglRnd on the best means of reducing the rate of discount in both capitals, but public rumour gives himn another mission, and this mission relates to the l)anubian Principalities. We are told that he is to confei with Lord Palmerston, and, if possible, come to an understanding on this troublesome subject. Several days ago It was stated that, after some difflieidty, a plan had at last been found, on which there was the least difference of views, which was the most likely to be unobjected to in its general terms, and which vill please all parties. This project the Reprenentatives of the foreign Powers have employed their time in preparing, so as to present it to the Congress almost on the first day of meeting, with a fair pro- spect of its being accepted. That a good deal of I attention has been given to the question, and that it has been discussed between the Emperor and his diplomatic visitors during the sojourn at Compiegne, is very probable, but that matters have arrived at the point alluded to ie, I think, incorrect. The Danubian question is one of much diffliculty, and the difficulty does not so much arise from the fitness or unfitness of the Moldo-Wallachian population for representative institutions as from guarding the rights of the Suzerain coneurrently with reforming the administration. The Prusian and Russian Ministers have been questioned on the viewrs of their Governments; they have maintained a reserve, and merely declared that no resolution had been comae to, or was likely to be come to, until complete Information was before the Congress, who would no doubt decide for the best. There was little necessity to consult Austria or Turkey, and the avowed opposition of these Powers to the project of the French Oovernment for the political union of the Principalities was, as we I have seen, avenged by the exclusion of their hapless Representatives from the festivities of Compipgne. The Emperor, or his Minister, took up the question with unusual ardour; the Moldo-Wallachians were encouraged to regard the French Emperor as the special protector of their liberties and independence; and Baron de Talleyrand's original instructions were, if ieport speaks true, to keep that enthusiasm at boiling point. The French Commissioner very probably improved on the lesson, and the MoldoWVallachians were soon in a state of fever. The situation at last became inconvenient-the Roimans appeared disposed to pass all bounds, and to give much trouble to their protectors, and the heEitation of Prussia, Uge suspicious silence of Russia, the divergent views of England, and the avowed disqosition of Austria and the Porte, rendered it pronable that the Emperor of the French, wtho was to be in the eyes of Europe the moderator of the "situation," 'would be left alone. The Emperor did not conceal his forebedings on that point; he intimated his wish that the Governments intereeted should send instructions to their Commissioners so to frame their repo.tsto the Congress on theproceedings of the Divans as to facilitate a modificationof his views on the union of the Principalities. The Emperor could plainly see he had gone too far, and that he would not be supported in the Congress. The Ministerial press was ordered to prepare the public for the modification. The Constitutieon2 and Pays performed the duty as tenderly as posible. The istructions of one of the Governments to their Commissioner at Bucharest were that he should never lose sight of the articles of the Treaty of Paris touching the rights of the Sultan and the integrity of the Porte. If the Divans voted a resolution for the union of the Principalities,their self-government, and their government by a foreign hereditary Prince, well and good-nothing could be better; but in doing so it should never be forgotten that the Sultan, the recognized Suzerain of these provinces, had a voice inthe matter. If his Highness accepted all or any of these resolutions, so much the better for the parties concerned; but that acceptance was an Indiapensable condition, and this must never be lost sight of. The aame resolution of the Congress which called the Divans to express their wishes provided for 'the authority and the integrity of the Porte. Inttructions like these, it is said, were sent to its Commi6sioners by one of the Goveinments on whom, I believe, the Emperor most counted for support. If this be the case, we need not wonder at any change he has undergone. It would be curious to know precisely what the Emperor thinks now about the vitality of the Turkish Empire-whether it has ever crossed his mind that the Sultan was " sick" past recovery, and that the time was not far off when he raight step into the Emnperor Nicholas's shoes. The Presse publishes a letter from "A n Englishman residing in Paris," complaining of a statement made some evenings back by the Pays relative to the capture of Delhi, and in which that journal expresses its astonishmuent that the English journals should have passed over in silence the massacre of women and children which took place there. After eakin generally of the massacre, the langnage of ePays, which appeared to us at the time to bear so little the mark of correctness that we refrained from giving the article, ran thus:- " When the olty was taken bodies of cavalry stopped all the issues, and prevented any one from leaving, and all were put to death. That lasted three days, and the number of women and children who perished ona that occasion was 317."1 The writer who addresses the Presse on the subject repaes as follows:- " The Ecglish press is unfortunate enough not to possess the wondrous souroes whence the Pays so often derives its Information. It appears to me, however, that these as' sertions would have aquired infinitely greater value had the Pays deiged to make known whence it obtained the preise number of 317, and how the corps of cavalry, which only consdsted at moat of 1,000 men, could, while pursuing the fugitives, have blocked up the issues of a city measuring two miUes in length, 1; ia breadth, and b. miles in cironmference. Yet, admitting the correctness of the number of 317 killed (but of whioh the correctness may vell be doubted, as even the loss of the English arrmy is not yet officilly known), how can the Pays prove that they were masWacred ? A town is bombarded for six days, and when attacked the streets are defended inch by inch, and y t astonishment is felt that 317 women and children were kled. As cannon-balls, when fired, do not go precisely where it is wished, there would be a much greater cause for astonishment had it been the contrary." The writer then quotes several passages from the Indian papers, which, in giving an account of the capture of the place, state that the women and children were everywhere protected when met with. He gives, in particular, passages from the Bombay l^imes and the Laltore Chrotnicle, and then quotes the official despatches, which testify to the great number of women and children who came from the city, and were received and taken care of by the assailants. Lastly, the writer proves, from General Chamberlain's despatch, that the English officers exerted themselves with success to put a stopto the acts of license which are inevitable on the storming of a great city, and concludes by denouncing the article of the Pays as being nothing else than "a calumny." Lord Brougham has arrived in Paris.

M. Guizot, who Is absent from Paris, was represented by his son, ML William Guizot. M. Thiers was unable to attend from indisposition, but all his family were present. We observed, besides several ladies of rank, the Duke de Montebello, M. Dumon, and many other former Ministers and public functionaries holding office during the reign of the late Louis Philippe, eeveral senators and members of the present Legislative Body. The press and the bar were repreBented by their most eminent members, among whom we recognized M. Dupin, former AttorneyGeneral at the Court of Cassation. As the chapel is small it became necemsary to perform several mauses, in order that the crowds in attendance might attend the solemn office. Many ladies of high rank, who found the chapelfull on their arrival, knelt in the open air, though the day was cold. A number of operatives from Neuilly, with whom the lamented Duches was a great favourite, likewise attended. The Chapel of St. Ferdinand was built by Marie Amelie, Queen of the French, as an offering of expiation on the spot where the late Duke of Orleans zo unfortunately lost his life by a fall from his carriage. Dr. Scrive, who acted as Physican-General to the Frencharmy during thelast war withRussia,hasjuast published a book which contains a painful account of the loss and sufferings endured by the French troops landed in the East, but particularly by those engaged in the siege of Sebastopol. Of 809,278 officers and men sent from France during that short war 200,000 entered the hospitals, and were treated professionally, 50,000 for wounds received in action, and 150,000 for diseases of various kinds contracted during the campaign. The first troops which embarked in France were attacked with cbolera which followed them to Athens, Gal. lipoll, Varna, and the Dobrudateha. That scourge appeared to suspend its attack for a brief period, while the French in conjunction witfh their British allies gained the victory at the Alma. On their arrival before Sebastopol the cholera again attacked them, and the receptions in the military hospitals during the month of January, 1855, amounted to 9,000. They were chiefly treated for cholera, scurvy, froetbites, and wounds of every description. Typhus fever shortly after set in, butwas quickly checkedby the energetic treatment adopted by the French physicians. The health of the army was better during the spring of 1855, but the cholera reappearedin July and placed 4,500 men hors de combat. Typhus fever set m again and added to the mortality. On the 8th of September Sebastopol was taken by the allied armies, but, nevertheless, between the 1st of September, 1855, and the 1st of April, 1856, of 145,120 French troops under arms in the Crimea 48,000 entered hospitals. Dr. Scrive says that the scurvy prevailed at this period, the constitution of the men being Impaired through fatigue and privations. The doctor further adds that the most disstrous period of the campaign, in a medical point of view, was during the months of February andMarch 1856. A violent typhus, engendered by the infection of the heaps of refuse in the camp, struck down more than 19,000 soldiers at the end of the campaign, notwithstanding the precautions adopted by the medical staff. It Is said that the number of sick in hospital in proportion to the force under arms was never so great in any former campaign. Of the medical staff 83 physicians or surgeons fell victims to their devotedness-" an enormous figure," observes the author, " when one reflects oa the Bmall number employed." The French fleet likewise suffered serious losses from sickness.

In the fourth leader of The Times of Saturday, the 14th inst., it is said that the British Goverament has come to an agreement with Austria " to send all its telegrams by way of Ragusa to Alexandria, if the Imperial authorities will make a submarine telegraph between those two cities." Such a convention was on the very point of being concluded, but authentic Snformation has this morning been given me that Her Majesty's Government has at the last moment expressed its resolve neither to bind its own hands nor those of its successors. It would have been a sad mistake if the British Cabinet had pledged itself to make use of but one line of communication with India, but still the idea of constructing a telegraph between Dalmatia and Egypt ought not to be relinquished. By the little map of the "c Existing and Proposed Communication between England and the East," which is at the top of Keith Johnston's recently published map of India, it is to be seen that a cable could easily be laid down between Ragusa and Alexandria, but Austria positively refuses to do this without receiving some remuneration or indemnification from England. The language used here whenever tho subject is touched on is to the following effect: -" Austria does not need telegraphic information of what is passing in India, but England does, and It is therefore but just that she sheuld contribute something towards the construction of any submarine telegraph which may be made to Alexandria, or agree to pay a certain annual sum for the transmission of her despatches. Should she refuse to do either the one thing or the other, Austria will, as a matter of course, have nothing at aU to do with the matter." Such are the seitiments of those persons on whose good will the construction of a submarine telegraph between Ragusa and Alexandria must entirely depend. A day or two since the long expected order for the reduction of the army left the Emperor's Cabinet. Some time may, perhaps, elapse before the exact contents of the Imperial ordinance become known, but the reduction in the cavalry will not exceed 6,000 men. It Is not probable that the artillery will be much reduced. The fourth battalions of the 62 regiments of the line wu e be entirely done away with, and many o f the een forming the third battalions will also receive an indefinite leave of absence. No estimate of the number of men to be sent to their homes can yet be given, hut it is stated in financial circles that the expenditure for the army during the military yea r 1858 (beginning November 1st, 1857) Is not likely to exceed 100,000,000fl. The Austrian commercial world is in great distress, and several respectable firms would probably have fallen had they not been propped. The prices of raw prodcce declinedaily,nda mney mone iscae tsarthat maanufacturedrgoods finds bt few wholesale purchasers. The ubjoi ned extract, whi ch is from the Ost-Deeuthce Post, shows that there isa commercialas w as a monetary crisis here: "Hala the wool which was sent to the last Pests fair re. malned unsold, and there was little or no demand for maann factured and half-manufactur red goods, twist, yarn, &c. The manmufacturer, who for some time held back h is goods bebause he had not confidence In the persons who wisheg to puchause, now sees his magazines overstocked with things which he cannot sell at any price. The only consolation is, that as soon as the present stagnation is over there will, a x a mnatter Of course, be an unusually great demand for all kinds of manufactured goods. The best possible proof thit colnmne* is At a stadsbti is, that the bil portfo :lo of the Bank is not bso large by 6,000,00oas t was it the mouth of October."o The Austrian Bank has lent 1,000,000of for three maonths to the TriesteBourse Deputation, which will employ ft lu l discounting local bills of exchange. We learn from Prague that large quantities of silver have during the last few days been exported to Germany,, and it appears very zWwat a that such should be the cas As long as the rate of discount of the Austrian Bank is 3 and 4 per cent.I lower than that of other countries it will pay well to export silver, and the fact must be perfectly well known to those persons who a few days since counselled the Minister of Finance to leave the rate of discount at 6 per cent. & financier states that M. Pereire, of Paris, has written to one of his correspondents in this city that the French Bank would like to borrow a certain sum from the Austrian National Bank, which, as you are aware, has now very nearly 10,0OO,000. in silver in its cellars. That the Imperial Government is not likely to authorize the Austrian Bank to lend money to its French contemporary need hardly be said. General Baron Mertens, the military commander at Trieste, gave a grand dinner in bonour of M. de Lesseps on the 15th inst. The Austrian officer wished M. de Lesseps success, and the latter, as a matter of course, drank the health of the Emperor of Austria The next toast, which was also proposed by M. de Lesseps, was " To the health of Ris Majesty the Sultan Abdul Medjid, and to the regeneration of his empire by means of commerce, industry, and the great works of civilization." It may be observed that the fndefatigable agitator In favour of the Suez Canal project speaks as if he were certain to obtain the necessary firman from the Sultan. He is already on his way to Constantinople. TUR}KEY. (moM O OUR OWN 0ORRM3oxD=T.) CONSTATINOPLE, Nov. iL Last week has been ratber poor in news, but not in feasts of reconciliation. Everybody has been dinig with everybody to celebrate the advent of the golden age, and everybody seems satisfied except the creditors of the State and palace and the French Ambassador, who still keeps aloof from the Grand Vizier. He has not been to pay him the nisit whichaccordingto etiquette every foreign repreeentative pays to a new Grand Vizier. He has only sent his first dragoman, and he transacts now all business through the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is by rightst the only channel of communication between the Foreign Ministers and the Turkish Government. In olden times, when the intercourse with foreign Powers began to extend, the PReis Effendi, and later the Dragoman of the Porte, were expressly appointed for official communications with European Aimbassadors, and it was rather dangerous for any other official to have much to do with them. From whatever grounds the French Ambamsador tries to put again into force this obsolete rule, it would be very desirable that he should be imitated. It would be an advantage for Turkey as well as Europe. We have ween different foreign influences prevail in Turkish Councils. Every great Power has had its share, some more and others less but al had it; at any rate, they boasted of it. tWell, and what has been the result of these influences? That almost everything which was attempted in order to please the prevailing influence has either now been completed, or else has become the caricature of the thing it was intended for. The change in the prevailtng influence is not sufficient to account for this result, as it stands to reason that had the Turks recognized something really good in any reform which was proposed they would probably have kept it up. We must seek for another cause of such an indifferent result, and I don't think this is difficult to find. It is simply that the Turks are neither weak enough to yield to nor strong enough to resist foreign influence at home. Whenever anything is proposed they don't dare to refuse, in order not to offend an Ambassador whom it is always unpleasant to have for an enemy. Without, therefore, inquiring much into the proposition made, and not unfrequently against his better convictions, the Grand Vizier or any other Minister agrees to follow the advice. The Ambassador or Minister writes home of the signal triumph which his influence has gained, and of the wonderful results which the adoption of his scheme is going to have on the destinies of the world in general, on those of his own country in especial, and on those of the Turkish empire in particular. Every one is satisfied-the Ambassador with his despatch, his Government with their Ambassador, the Turkish Minister with his own cleverness; and the result of all this is that after a month or two everything is forgotten and new proposals take place, are again Joyfully acoepted, and again just as soon forgotten. One would be almost inclined to believe in a private uliderstanding, so invariably does the thing occur. AT any rate, Bo much is certain-that many of the Turks take the advice merely with the view of giving to the Minister or Ambassador who tenders it an opportunity to be approved by his Government, and they don't think themselves in the least bound to carry out what they promised. For instance, all those Europeans who have by degrees been accepted by the Turks in one capacity or another at the recommendation of their respective Ambassadors complain that they are not allowed to do anything. Of course, the Turks when they accepted them never contemplated that they should do anything; they thought they would please some Ambassador by providing for a countryman or cllent of his. Whether right or wrong, the Turks have the idea that they can do perfectly well without advisers, and thus they are unfortunately under the impresSion that their advisers do not care so much about them as their own advice. It would be worth trying whether under these circumstances the policy adopted by the French Ambassador of conining himself entirely to his necessary official communications with the Minister of Foreign Affairs would not be the best. Experience has, I think, amply proved that continual interference has led to nothing. If advice is required let the Turks come themselves and ask for it. And just at present they are not a little in want of good advioe. The exchange is so high that money intercourse between this place and Europe has almost ceased. As much as 157 piasters to the pound are asked for good biUls of exchange in London. For all the money which Government has to send to Europe it has to pay this rate, while all the payments which are made to it are made in piasters which ought to have the value of 110 to the pound sterling. " What next?" is the question which everybody puts to himself? and the plan of consolidating all the debts and of issuing paper money is again under discussion. The plan, as far as I can ascertai, is to consolidate all the floating debts of the xovernment and the palace, as well as the paper money; the only exceptions would be the loans in Europe and the debased currency knovn under the name of " Beshliks." Treasury-bonds, bearing 6 per cent. Interest payable in gold, and guaranteed on some of the revenues of the Government, are to be substituted for the floating debt thus withdrawn. The first thing which strikes one IB the arithmetical question,-If the exchange on London is 157, if the Government paper current in the country and bearing as much as 10 per cent. interest is at 25-30 discount, and if the loan guaranteed by the Western Powers is at 80-83, at what price can the Turks expect to issue a new species of Treasurybonds bearing 6 per cent, interest?g The people who proposed this consolidation flatter tLhemselves that the payment of the interest in gold and the guarantee of the payment on some of the revenues of the State wil make people more favourably inclined towards this than the old paper. The idea is, to say the least, very naive. If the Turkish Government were to promise to repaythe Treasurybonds with 10 instead of 6percnt. interestin a year, nobody would take them. Why? Because nobody would believe that they would fuilfil what they say; or, in other words, they have no credit, and aU paper money operations turn on that. It is incredible that with all the dear experience the Turks have had they don't see yet that paper is paper. However it may be turned and changed, it always reflains the same, and ez nihio nihJifit. The more such illusory operations are going on the dearer they wiU have to pay in the end, besides the tariffs to which they must submit daily on the exchange. Aknother thing which I cannot quite understand in' the plan is what is to be substituted for the pa!per currency. Here scarcely anything eLse is seen i the daily transactions of shops and bazaars. No doubt, there is a good deal of gold and silver in the country which might be expected to come out, but it has been hidden until now, because there is no confidence. The Turkish Government paid away, for instance, about 4,000,0001. of the second loan in sovereigns over the country, but it never gets a penny of this money back in gold. The revenue farmers pay at Constantinople overnment paper, and the revenues of the provlxicee, whicb are not farnedj are sent through some baker or other, and arrive likewise in paper. The Government, unless it refuses to take its own Treau~-bends a moneyw which, of coure, would imne. diatelytake away all valueo from them, may depend upon it that the only diference which the consoli- dation will introduce will be that it ivill get Trea-' surv-bonds instead of kaim6s and sechinis, aud that 1 it v;ill have to pay a frightful price for tlhe gold with which the interest is to be paid. Thus, according to my oplnion, instead of getting out, they will rather get into difficulties by these plausible palliatives They mnst find money or aredit somewhere to help them, and they will never be.able to do without foreign caspital and foreign mnagement. SARDINIA. (FROY OUR OWN CORRgrPONDSN-.) TURIN, Nov. 18. This is the most anxious and, as it has turned out, most important day of the elections, but it will hardly be possible to communicate by this post the reult of the contest even in the two Turin colleges where a second ballot is to take place. The complexion of the returns received ap to yesterday evening was much the same as that of the preceding ones; that is to say, the clerical or retrograde party-the Conservatives, as they call themseives-have continued somewhat to improve their pxition as compared with that they held in the ialt Parllament. It is evident that both in the elections definitively decided and in those. which have to be repeated there are names and numbers unwelcome to the Liberals, the length of whose faees has perceptibly increased since Monday m6rning last. They do not expect a majority against them, but they evidently fear that the minority may be dangerously strong. Perhaps they overrate the peril, even as they before were too confident and secure. Disappointment often makes the over-sanguine unduly despond; and to-morrow, if things go vell to-day, the quicksilver may again mark the fever heat of triumph. It i to be presumed that in theprovinces, as here, the supporters of Count Cavour's Government have been making the most of the two days' interval between the first and second elections. There can be no doubt that the clerical party has done so. In fact, its operations might almost be traced in Turin by anybody who waa much out of doora during the two beautiful days that have just passed. The churchmen were abroad in numbers, and were everywhere to be seen, ilding, with silent celerity, in and out of houses. lthey struggled hard when their cause was scoffed at as hopeless, it is not surprising that they should do their utmost now that their efforts have been rewarded by at least a glimnmering of success. Eowever much opposed one may be to their objects, and averse to the means they employ to attain them, one caunot but recognize, and almost admire, the earnestneas and tenacity with which these men pu-sue their purpose. They have, moreover, a great advantage in the exceUence of their organization. Whatever the result of these elections may be, the Liberal party in Piedmont, whose aspirations and virtues have gained it so much sympathy in Europe, will assuredly have lost some little of its prestige by the evidence the contest has afforded of its imperfect preparations, and-as contrasted with the zeal and energy of its opponents-comparative apathy. Even if the retrograde party proves stronger initheChamberthan can reasonably be anticipated, it would, I think, be wrong to takethis as proof of a reaction in the feelings of the country, and especially in those of the intelligent and educated clsses. AR that it can fairly be said to prove is over confidence, leading to supineness; and it must also be admitted that, while the majority of the Ministers are liked and respected, there are one or two of them who are far from being popular. If we suppose the case of the retrograde party proving sufficiently strong in the new Chamber to put the Government on some measure or other (by skilful tactics and combination with the extreme left), in a minority, we may, I think, take for granted that Count Cavour would make another appeal to the country before resigning. He would certainly not be justified in doing otherwise. If the new elections did not strengthen his hauds, it then would be time enough (and far too soon for the good of Sardinia) for him to give up the Bower he now so ably wields. A less Liberal Minfitry would then be formed, and, although its existence would probably not be long, it would have time to do much harm. But this is supposing an extreme case. I am persuaded that the great Liberal party in this country, although it may for a moment have slumbered, wil prove true to itself and to the reputation it has won for good sense and love of liberty. It is surely not at the moment when we hear expressions of general gratification at the liberal movement in Belgium and of sympathy with the cause of Rouman emancipation that the Piedmontese will allow their own progress to be arrested. Second elections take place In at least half the colleges. NWe have about 90 decisive returns from the first elections. Among these 90 deputies there are 28 of the retrograde party. Della Margherlta, the man who, according to the imprudent predicslons of his opponents, was scarcely to get in for one place, is returned for four-his former college, San Quirico, having elected him. A number of priests have been retulrncd,-so many that people say it wvill be easy to have mass celebrated in the Chamber. Count Ahfonso Della Marmora, the gallant Generalof the Crimea and the skilfulorganizer to whom Piedmont owes Its army, has been rejected by Paucalieri, the place for which he sat in the last Parliament. A Count Asinsr, a retrograde candidate, has been preferred, perhaps on account of his name, by the asini of that college. Fortunately, the College of Biella has shown better taste, and has returned Della Marmora. RALF-PAST 3 o'cLocx. The two Liberal candidates in the 6th and 7th colleges of Turin have been returned in the second elections, Messrs. Miglietti and Brofferio. Count Revel's defeat is considered a great triumph. Turin has done Its duty to the Liberal and constitutional cause. We have only two returns from the provinces, but one of them is important-that of Signor Rattazzi, the Minister of the Interior, who has been elected by a large majority. EXPLOSION AT MAYENCE. The powder magazine of the Federal fortress of Mayence, on the Rhine, blew up at 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the 18th instant. The magazine was rsituate nearthe Gauthor Gate. The number of persons killed and wounded is very considerable, but no official list has M yet been published. Three churches have been seriously damaged. The shock was felt at Wiesbaden, on the other side of the Rhine. A supplement to the Mayence Gazette says-" The Ganthor powder magazine has jus.t exploded with a terrible report. The upper part of the town, the Kaestrich, and the Gaustrasse, are in ruins. The Church of St. Stephen has been destroyed. This terrible disaster has caused the deaths of many persons, and deprived numerous families of home and shelter. The whole town is in a state of consternation.' Travellers, says the Cologne Gazette, who have just arrived from the scene of the catastrophe state that the magazine contained 75,000 kilogrammes of gunpowder. Not only have the windows In every part of the town been broken, but even in the surrounding villages. Enormous blocks of stone from the rampartz have been carried to an incredible distance. It is dangerous to walk In the streets on account of falling houses. The explosion was distinctly heard at Bingen. The IMupeniance Bel.e has the following " Aterrible explosion has just taken place at Mayence. The damage is estimated at more than a million of florms. According to credible information, two Austrian and nine Prussian soldiers and 14 'civilians were kIlled; 74 Prussiau and 94 Austrian soldiers and 300 clvilians more or less dangerously wounded." Since the above was written we have received the following details:- " MAYENCE, Nov. 18, 4 r.r. " A fearful catastrophe occurred about an hour since. The old prison tower at the Ganthor, which had been conrertedinto a powader mgazine, has exploded. A great numbe of persona ,n the addnityhave been killed. The Church oF St. Stephen Ir a heap of ruins; the Evangelical Chnzch Is alro much damaged. In the citadel the soldiers wrez at dril when the explosion took plwce. A great nunmber of themware wounded. The so-called School of English Young Ladles Ls destroyed, but the Inabitants are saved. One-half of the Gau.street and the Old Gstricht, with l1Ei shop are in umins An enormous block of stone fell oni the roof of the Caf6 de Panrs, and orushed through all the storles. Shells are continually bursting near the powder mngazine, and no ons is allowed to approach too near." Gelneral Bonin, the Vice-Goveraor of Mayence, bas sent tho two following despatches to the Prince of Pzwia:~ of JuAYENi.CE, Nov. 18, .5.25 P.M. "At 5 minutes to 3 this afternoon the powder magazine of Fort Martin, near the G-n-thor exploded. It contained j about 200 owt. of powder. Ma4y lires hbave been lost. Two Etreetg have been completely destroyed. The danger is not yet over. Shells are ontinually exploding. Two othor, powder magazines full of powder are near at hand. " 7.35 23 "The danger is over. Temporary roofs have been con-' structed over the other powder magazines, and every measure of precaution has been taken. Seven dead bodies have been taken out. SEventeea soldiers are dangerously wounded and 70 slightly." A letter from Mayence dated the 18th of November says,- " The telegraph will, doubtless, have informed you of the catastrophe which this day hs befallen this city. I live in the (au-street, in a solidly built mnsdon. I was writing in my room, when I felt a terrible shock, accompanied by a terrifio noise; at the same time all the windows were smmahed to atoms, the doors were thrown off their hinges, and my books and papers scattered about the room; brickg fell out of the walls. A dense smoke and dust poured in through the windows, and prevented me seeing what had taken place. When it cleared off I saw the roof of St. Stephen's Church riddled like a sieve; modt of thehouseswre in the sme condition. All the inmates of my house rushed into my roomin a state of alarm. Mfost of them were hurt and bleeding; I only then peroeIved that I had been hurt in the hand and ws bleeding. We soon heard that the powder magazine had exploded. I went to the door and found that the other side of the treet was in ruins; the street was filled with groans and lamentations. The military were taking away the dead on stretchers. The gaspipes having beea damaged the whole city was soon in darkness. At the Carmelite Church a wall from seven to eight feet It thickness was reot as;uder. Seme heavy guns were thrown into the air like sicoks. Some of the Federal troops were ercising at the time; two Anstriias and nine Prussiang were killed on the spot; 95 Austrians and 34 Prussians were wounded; 18 dead bodies of civilians have been taken from the ruias, and 300 are dangerously wounded. The military autborities have taken every measure to afford relief to the sufferers."
nhe NEW MAIL CO/SA&fUXAATJIOAV ciml INDIA. (Flrom the 7,rm Iij, Aeoording to theneow regulations for ihe improved mall communication with India, mails will be made up in the General Post-offloe for-Bombay, vid Marseilles on the 2d and 17th of the month, and for Calcutta, vid Warseilles, on the 9th and 25th of the month. The packet will leave Bomibay with malls for London, vid Marseilless on the 9th and 24th of the month- and from Calcutta with mails for London, tid MraeWes, on the 8th rnd 22d of the month. The Mediterranean packets will leave Alexandria for Marseilles with the Indian mails on the 7th, 11th, 22d, and 27th of the month, and arrive at Maeilles on the 2d, 12th, 16th, and 27th, and suck mails will reach London on the 4th, 14th, 18th, and 29th of the nonth. The mail will reach Bombay from London, vU Marseilles, in 26 days, and Calcutta from London, i4 Xaselles, in 36 days. Nearly the same periods of time respectively will be occupied In the mails reaching London, vid Marseilles, from Bombay and Calcutta. The new arrangements will commence at Bombay on the 24th proximo. The Caleutta packets will touch At Kidgeree on the homeward pyage. There can be no doubb that the Trieste steamaers will ran In connexion with each arrival at Alexandria, zad acoording to the present speed ef those steamers we should get telegrams of Indianr news from Trieste on the 1st, 12th, 16th, and 27th of the month. But a the telegrams of Indian news, via Marseilles, will reach us on the 2d, 12th, 26th, and 27th, the former tele. Lgans will often be superseded unless the speed of the rieste boats is improved. When the telegraphi oommunication between Calcatta, Madras, and Bombay is uninterrupted, we shall have telegraphic news from all parts of India by every arrival at harseilles, that is, four times a month-viz., on the 2d, 12th, 16th, and 27th of the month, as before stated. This newa will be alternatelr 24 and 34 days old. The only additional work which wi devolve on the Peninsular and Oriental Company in consequenoe ot thin modification of their conct will be the running of a steamer to and from Alexandria and Marseilles rid falta four ttimes a month instead of twice, and the calng at Kidgeree from Calcutta. According to the old oontract the packets left Bombay on the 3d and 17th of the montb, and Clcutta on the 10th and 24th of the month. It was arrnged for the 3d and 24th boats to arrive together at Suez, and for the 10th and 17th boats to arrive at that port also at the same time. Calonita being nearly 2,000 miles further from Suez than Bombay, this differenoe of time in leaving the two Indian ports was absolutely necesary in order to time the two packets together at Suez. But to carry out the new arrangements and bring the Bombay and Calcutta packets to Suez at different times, it is necessary to destch the packets from the two Indian ports almost at the same time. Thus, instead of leavig Bombay or Calcutta on the 3d, 10tb, 17th, and 24th of the month, as has hitherto been the case, by which a week intervenes oGnveniently between each departre, the packets Iwill for the fuztur hare to leaLve Bombay or Calcutta, on the 8th, 9th, 22d and 24th of the month, as has been before ebeerved. Now, these are certainly not such convenient times for departure from the Indian ports as the former ones, especilly consoidering that Calcutta can be united by telegraph to Bombay; but there Is no help for it. A dis. advantage of the old plan was, that the packets, owing to the length of the sea route, the difference in the speed of the steamers and casualties, sarely ever arrived at Suez together; and then one mail was kept wating for the other at Alexandria. The advantage of the newp plan is that as soon as a mail Arrives at Alexandria, no matter whether it is from Bombay or Calcutta, it Will be immediately sent off to Marseilles. It will be seen from the above satement that there wiU be only two mal packets a month to and from Suez and Bombay; and two to and from Suez and Calcutta, the same as at present. There will also be only two communications a month for the present to and from Southamp. ton and Alexandria, and to and from Point de lAle and Hongkong. The following are the mailrounte tables, accordiLg to the new arrangements, viz. - OUTWARD INDLt MAIlS Bombay DespatcL.-Leaves London on the 2d and 17th of the month.

THE EASTERN CoAsr.-Some serious shipping disasters, attended with the loas of eoveral lives, occurred ladt week off the eastern coast. The Anglo-French Company's steamer Ernestine came in collWion with a schooner, supposed to be lden with grain, but name unknown. The schooner sank almost immediately before asitance could be rendered to her by the crewof the steamer, and before any of her hands could be saved. The bark IAddesdale, of and from Shields for Aden, grounded on the Longsand, off Harwich, duriDg a thick fog. The llves of the crew and pUot were saved, but they were compelled to abandon the vesseL The steamer Triton, from London for Great Yarmouth, came in collision with a barge laden with stone, and the wife of the master of the be and three children were drowned. The brig Colony, of Whitby, from Shields for London, sank in coming up the river at Great Yarmouth, havngpreviously sustained much damage from having been in collision with the Babes, of Jersey. Mr. Gildon, the rnate of the Colony, was drowned. The bark Pearl, of and from Sunderland for Carthagena, got on the beach at Sherringham during a very thick fog, but she was subsequently ase off gain withott having sutained material damage. The fishing logger Sallors' Friend came In collisdon with the Phoenlx, of and from Sunderland for Calai The lugger 'was a good deal damaged in the collision, but has been brought into Great Yarmouth harbour. Six of her crew jumpod on board the Pheenix, and were also landed at Great Yarmontb. The lugger Rosemavy, of Lowestoft, was run into by the b-g MUargaet Cook, of Great Yarmouth. Six of the lugger' crew jumnped on bord the brig, and were landed at South. wold; the logger ws afterwards brought into Loowestoft harbour. Captain Bde, of the sloop William and Ann, of Harwich, reports that, while off Orfordness, he saw a laden brig running up on the port task (east-southtcast) and a light brig running on the larboard tack.

IRBLAND. (PROM OUR OWN ORIroLwNDmM) DUBLIN, SATURDAY MOniORMX, PROSEqUTION or TaE PEIESTt. The Eventing MAiii the old organ of the Cons. 6ervative party here, without undertaking the defence of the Irish Attorney-General from the combined attacks of gtuasi friends and open foess considers that so far the learned gentleman has acted straightforwardly in the performanoe of the bidding of the House of Commons. He hm done his duty, ton, in accordance with precedent, for ib is the customn to conduct prosecutions of this particular kind by e-oficio information. The Macil then quotes the following passage from Cole ort Crimraac Infoinations "' Although the Attorney-General may, i1 he i:alnks ft; exhibit a criminal information c-ofid for any misdo. me4mour wh.tever, yet in practice he seldom doe so eypnt when directed by the House of Commons, the Lords of tge Treasury, or the Commissioners of some public department, or where the case is of a very serious nature." Thia rule, it appears, was reduced to practice by Sir Frederick Pollock m 1841, when, by order of the House of Commons, he proceeded by, evofficio informatlons to prosecute a person named Long for bribery ht the Cambridge election. The prosecution now pending against the directors of the British Bank is also by ex-officio information, though instituted, not by direction, but at the suggestion of tha House of Commons. The Freeman's Journal asserta, in reference to the expedition of dragoons to Ballin1 robe that all that parade might have been spared by dropping a line to r. Conwray, intimating that a warrant lay for bim at the residence of some atipendiary magistrate. The fact, howrever, haps pens to be that a " line" wras wrritten to Mr. Conway by the Crowii Solicitor on the 4th of November, callig upon him to enter an appearance in cour by his attorney, and when that intimation was disregarded another "line" to the following effect was sent to the rev. gentleman:- " 45, Jildare-street, Dablin, Nov. 7. "Rev. Sir,-In referenoe to the letter which I addreasa to you on the 4th inst., intimating that, in pursuanoe of the order of the House of Coammons, it was intended to exhl. bit an information against you in the Queents Bench, to relation to certain tranactions connected with the late electiou for the county of Mayo, and suggesting that to save you any unnecessary inconveniencoe yoU should instruct our attorney to enter an appearance for you, and put hioself i' coamnunication with me, I oeg further to apprie you that the information has been this da rfiled, and tha it willnoor be my duty to issue a Bench warrant aainst you, and senad it doawnfer execution in due ourseo The object in issuing a Bendh .4rraft is to enforce an appearance to the informa. tion and puttlug in bail; and I have to informu you that yow may prevent the necessity of having the warrant executedi by instructing an attorney to act here on your behslf. Rev questing your immediate attention to the subject, " I remain your obedient servant "WM. KY3 EIIS, Cro'wn Solicitor." It was only when this second summons failed, and when it was intimated through the public journals that the action of the Sheriff would be made the occasion of a scene at BaUinrobe, that the Dragoons were put in requisition, and with what result is by this time pretty wellknown. The health of the Rev. Mr. Ryan, the second traverser, is sid to be any. thing but good, and that last week his state was so precarious that he required constant medical attendance. Hls solicitor has entered the requisite appearaace for him at the Queen's Bench-office, and was furnished with a copy of the information, which, although containing but 10 counts, is of most forrcidable length. TraIE LAn rAMiUn QUnaNSTOWN. Advice from Cork contain accounts of a meeting of the creditors of Messrs. James Scott and Co., of Queenstown, which was held on Thursday at the office of their solicitor, Mr. Thomas Jameson. Between 60 and 70 persons attended, either personaUy or by their representatives. Mlessrs. Philip and George Scott were also present. |" Mr. Edmund Burke having been called to the chair, "hrr. Jaineson laid before the meeting a statementi of the present financial circumstances of the firm. The total liabilities amounted to 129,Â¶3761., of which the secured debts were 47,6791., leaving a balance of 81,6971. unsecured The available assets amounted to 109,2251., which, deducting the secured debts, 47,6791., left 61,5464 to meet the unsecured debts, amounting to 81,697t. There thus appears to be adeficit of 20,1511. The assets were made up as follows:-Ships, and freights due thereon, 53,0001.; houses, 44,6001.; other property, 11,62'.; total, 109,2251. The house property is liable to two mortgages. for10,000t. to the Provincial Bank, and 4,0001. to a firm In this city,with v. contingent mortgage of 5,0001. also to the bank, The ships ar liable to mortgages of 8,0001. The house propertyisletatan annual rental of 2,5701, and includes some of the handsomest parts of Quesentown. The failure of the firm i3 stated to have resulted from that of the Liverpool Borough Bank, together with the general pressure of the moneymarket and the depreciation in the value of shippint. ir. Jameson then sAid he was authorized on the part of Messrs. Scott to submit the following proposition to the meeting:_ T ' That thle property ahoul& be placed in the hands of trueeo. ana that the creditors should take cooeptanes for a comDonton of s1 6S in the pound, Payable ia three instalments, at Intetralx of 6. 14 ans 18 montbh.' " The statement wvas roeeived favourably by the creditors; several of whom declared their entire confidenoe in the honour and integritd of the firm, insomuch as one of them suggested that the Meesrs. Scott should be peraitted to worik the concern themseives without the intervention of trustees, but this proposition was at onco refused by the Messmr. :cott themselves. " A committee of inspection was appointed on the sug. gestion of MIr. Jameson, with power to employ an ac. countant to examine the books of the firm and asoertain the correctness of the statement as to their liabilities and assets. Should they report favourably the creditors expressed them. selveS ready to accede to the proposed arrangement. "A second meeting will be held in w week to recoeive the report of the committee." THE RcaNT RUN UTPONh Tr IRISx HANKS. The following is extracted from the monetary article in the Dublin Evening Post:- "Evon before the time we had anticipated there m indi. catons of reaction in Ireland; and the London jourls anzounce the return of a portion of the exta supplies of gold with which the Irish banks had had the prudenoe to provide themselves as Eoon as the indications of panic had become apparent. We had expressed our opinions with confidence, because we were thoroughly satisfied that mercantile business generally had been, in latter years, conducted with remarkable care, and with acomplete avoidance of those specu. lative operations which so often end in disaster to all concermed. Unreflecting peeple have said that our safet is to be attributed to the decline of trade in Ireland; but this is a serious error; for trade has been increasing with our progress in wealth and prosperity. It is, however, a trade not forced by inflated credit, but regulated by natural demand and sustained by legitimate resources. Knowing this, we felt it to be our duty to the country to discountenanoe the wild excitiement that led to the run upon the banks in various parts of the south, and often to demonstrate the danger of that most mischievous and senseless panic among a portion of the peasantry. Most fortunately, common sense has once more prevailed ; the panic has entirey oeased in almost all places to which it had extended, dying out. The banks have inourred som.e cost and trouble in consequence of theosuddenness of the increased demands upon them; but they will be well compensated by the useful lesson afforded by the result, proving the readiness with which their amplo resources can be made available whenever the peasantry allow themselves to become the victims of senseless apprehensions. It is stated in some of the provincial journals that the markets for agricultural produce have become depreciated during this effervescence about the banks; and this is one of the evil conseouenoes, However, experience of this kind may be useful in mducing people to act with more prudence hereafter. We must add that there ws no pre. tence for yielding to the panic in Ireland, because it was well known that the country has boeen steadiy improvin, that trade is in a most healthy condition, and that credit. ws never, perhaps, in so sound a state. Here, at the close of the panio, there is not a single filure connected with the trade o Ireland, and we hear of no complaints, as regarda the banks, of the withholding of legitimate accommoda. tion."p ENCU-MBEREDD ESTATEs COURT. The extensive estates of the late Marquis of Anglesey, situate in the county of Louth, were sold yesterday at the Court in Henrietta-street.

COMMISSION OF LIEUTEAANOY FOR THE CITY I ~~~OF LONDON. The Right Hon. the Lord mayor attended at Guilhal on Friday last, and opened the new commission of lieu. tonancy. There was a very large assemblage of commissioners, most of the Aldermen being present, Directors of the East Ind3A Company, the Bank, and the South Sea-house. Several of the deputies, and many of the principal merchants and bankers of the city, as well as members of Parliamont, were also present. The swearing in of members occupied about half an hour,when the eommission was read, and Mr. Henley Smith was reappointed clerk. Messrs. Bossaiquet, the bankers, were appointed agents to the Rloyal London Militia, The Committee on Head-quarters and Vacant Commisslons ras appointed, as was also the Audit Committee. Mr. Jennings was reappointed architect and surveyor, aud Mr. Neale messenger. Questions were asked as to why the Royal London Militia had not been called out, as had been the case with other regiments of Mlilitia. The COLO'NEL, in reply, stated he believed that a very fair selection had been made, taldng one regiment from each county and those which had done such good service at Malta, Gibraltar, and Corfu during the late Crimean war. The Tower Hamlets had been selected for the London district, and he understood that so soon as Lord Panmure had disposed of the regiments now being embodied a further selection would be made, pro. bably soon after Christmas, and that the Royal London would be included in the number. His oflicers -ware so anxious for active duty that one of his lieutenants had raised 100 men, and at his own expense sent them to tlin sevy. -Lnau omcerzaa been gazetted to a commission and was now doing duty in a line regiment. His men were equally desirous with the officers of serving their country. He had permitted upwards of 100 men to join the Tower Hamlets rather tban remain in idleness. Recruits were coming in so fasb that he had no doabt be vrould have his full complement of men before the regiment was called out. He deolared a vacancy for the majority, one captain, two lieutenants, and two ensigns. Several applications for commissions were laid before the Court, and it was referred to the Committee on Vacant Commissions to examine the testimonias of the several candidates, and report upon them at an early Court. The Colonel said he was anxious that the vacant commissions should be filled up as early as pos. sible previous to the regiments being embodied. The cornulittee was ordered to meet on Friday next, at I o'cloek. Mr. JPsN1iNGS reported the head-quarters as nearly finshed; fiies had been lighted for some time in the armouries, which he bad no doubt might be occupied at Christmas-certaizly by New Years-day. This beini the first Court since the holydays apd the issuing of thio new commaision, a great deal of routine business wae transacted, and the proceedings lasted till a late hour. A2dvevteaieii."

STATE OF TRADE. MANCEESIER, Nov. 2L The xmnjort 7 of commercial men speak in a more hopeful tone of tbe r of trade this morning, but we have still a BUeptisilol of business. If we had a thorough remtorati-,", 0.1-1fidence there would still be the difficulties inte-rposed by th. srate of the money-market, and thosc diffi- ulties are still piessiig very heavily upon this district. It iS not easy to re.dize the thorough prostration of trade, and few peopl r,coll- ot a blow of the kind having taken effect in so short a period before. The number of people in idleness aud all at. *e reduced to destitution in Lancashire is amost past belief. There is, however, a feeling that the critis wiU nml. be of long duration, but that, with the abundant supplies of produce from all quarters of the globe seeking a suarko-, an industrial community will not long waste tbe eniergies necessary to secure a share of it. The more sauguine commereial people anticipate a thorough resumption of the cotton trade soon After Christmas. BIRMLNGRAKf, Nov. 2L The stoppage of the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire BaDking Con pany, which was announced in The tIneV of Tuesday, followed by the suspension of several extensive manufacturing e6tablishments, has been the absorbing topic of the week, ln our last notice of the atate of trade. while we represented appearxaces in South Staffordshire to be upon the whole satisfactory, we did not coneal the fact thatconsiderable apprehension was entertained as to the future of the iron trade. l:ver since last quarter-day Amnerican orders have been few, and latterly almost entirely suspended, but this absenoe of Transatlantic trade, during the period to which we refer, has been more than oounterbalanced by increasing demands for the home trade; while credit, since the disasters which occurred in 1855, was considered to have been satisfactorily re-established: This delusion has, hLwever, been dissipated, and at present a anic prevails throughout the iron districts. There seems to be little doubt, notwithstanding, that the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Bank will resume payment in the course of a few days, andpresent calarities be thus in some dogree materially mitigated. In the midst of the confusion consequent upon the exclting events of the week, we have been anxious to obtain reliable Information as to the real condition of the iron ranufacture; and we learn that, although there is a considerable falling off in the Amnerican export trade, home requirements are moderately good. Certain desoriptions are offered at slightly lower quotations, but first makers maintain quarter-day prices. It is difficult, however, to say, under present circumstances, how long this firmness will be sup. ported. We have no wish to excite unnecessary alarm, but the suspension of several manufacturing establishments in hich severalthousands of workpeople are employedisfraught, particularly at this season of the year, with the most serious consequences. Hitherto, however, the opezatives have conducted themselves in the most orderly manner, and the best means have been adopted to maintain the peace of the district. The commercial and manufacturing interests of Birming}a are quiet and generally less depressed than might have '-an expected. Itmay be premature to oongratulatethe .own upon its escape from the disasters which have fallen upon other manufacturing communities, but as yet we have heard of no defalcations, and, although unquestionably business is slack, oredit has been hitherto weU maintained. The American bouses are doing little or nothing, but they ttate that their lut advicee are more encouraging than those previously received. Adverses rurnour have unfavourably affected one house, but their transactions are understood to be too limited to be of serious cousequence to the general trades of the town. The brass foundry busiuess, if not partioularly active, remains steady. No alteration has been declared In the -price of copper, and none is likely to occur while the demand continues after the present rate. Most of the workshops employed upon useful articles continue, in-ful work, and seem to be little affected by absence of Americau orders and the monetary pre8sure. The lamp manufacture is brisk, and the Government Tower work, In oonnexion with the East India contracts, as might be expected, is active. NOTINGHA.M, Nov. 21. * There has been no improvement in the lace trade during the week. The home market, which at thig season of the year is usually flat, remains in a dull state; and for the American market, which at this period is generally brisk, there is next to nothing doing. Manufacturers continue to exercise great caution in producing goods, and stocks are light. Silk has a downward tendency. In hosiery there is next to nothing doing. In all branches the trade is deplorably dull, and no improvement is looked forward to until after Christmas. At the 21st annual general meeting of Moore and Robinson's NottinghaTashire Banking Company it was reported that the profits of the bank for the year had conslderably exceeded those of former years ; and although the directors deplored the difficulties at present affecting the manufacturing interests of this district, they congratulated the propietors that where trade had been conducted upon sound add healthy principles, comparatively little inconvenience had accrued from the monetary crisis created by the suspensions of payment connected with America, that had Lately taken place. A dividend of 12 per cent. free of income-tax), the addition'to thereserved fund of 2,001. (on account of premiums upon the sale of abcout 700 reserved shares), and the revaton of a lare sum, as a provision for doubtful debts, was agreed upon. LEICESTER, Nov. 21. There is very little alteration in the hosiery trade, which is exceedingly depressed, and the operatives are suffering a good deal from the present commerobi panic. In the meantime manufacturers are produoinggoods only to order, and thus keeping down stocks. Tne high rate of discount and the suspension of the Bank charter have not so much Influence in this as in many manufacturing towns. The wool-market Is dull. In y&ns there is a reduction in price, and spinners are working less hours. LEEDS, NTov. 21. It is a matter of considerable satisfaction, in these times of commercial and monetary panics, to find that the woollen cloth trade of this town and neighbourhood, though greatly depressed, is not sinking deeper and deeper in gloom. There is, it is true, but little demand for either the home or the foreign trade at present, and the manufacturers, with a caution which Is both commendable and cbaracteristic, are mostly running their works short time - yet with these unfavourable circumstances, there is genera1 contentment among the labouring population, and manufacturers and merchants are for the most part manfully meeting their engagements, and cheerfully looking forward to a change for the better. The tone of commerCial feeling has certainly improved during the week. The panic which prevailed in other towns is gradually subsiding, and a good effect natarally follows here. Notsthstanding the constsnt demands upon the Bank of England (as testified to daily by the city article of Tlhe Times), there is a general hope that, with the increased privilege already granted by the Government, the Bank will be enabled to give every necessary accommodation In all cases of legitimate trading. It is probable that there will not be much amendment in trade before the close of the year, but some expectation is felt that the early assembling of the two Houses of Parliaiment, when the condition of the nation will doubtless form a primary cause of discussion, may have a beneficial effect and give ahealthful impetus to the wheels of commerce. As these reports have ofton of late stated, all parties operate with caution, and purchases are made but to suib immediate wants; but there are some fair orders in hand and nearly completed in this locality for South America, also goods for our own army and striped liste for the China trade. These, of course, have employed and are employing some manufacturers and dyers nearly full time. To-day's markets in the cloth-halle have been very quiet, a very small bulk of goods having been sold. Indeed, manufacturers and merchants appear to meet at the halls rather as a formal matter than to do any real business. The feeling of the trade, we may state in general terms, was one of caution, bnt bonAfnl and trnstine as to theN fntnre. With this quiet state of things, and so little actual demand for cloth, it appears rather anomalous that there should be an improvement in the price of wool. Alluding to this the Leeds Intelligencer of to-day remarks:- " Good wools, esuea a3 are employed In this district, show an In. creaed firmness In price, the market being strengthened by the operations of foreign buyr. It Is stilt urged that the seucrity of the finer wools mnust prevent any reduction In value, but ' swaity' I a compartive terra, and depends quite as nunch ou the demand as on the supply. If the de nand for the next twelve month, ahould equal tbat of 1855 and 186. and the whole of our machinery be kept folly employed, then, undoubtedly, there will bcea scarely, and rotbhng can preent an advance In prioes. But if a reason of compartive depree. sion Is betore us at home, and the etate of the American and AutraUSaa marketa seriously affects our export trade, the eupDli will sihf^e foe osr require nents, and may perhaps exceed them. The prospects for 1858 are an open question, but, without tsking any gloomy view, we inorlle to think tbht the trade of she next six months wlU be de. cidedly below au average." As to the condition of the great bulk of the worklng population here, there is no doubt it is much better than tbat of a corresponding class In Nottingham, Preston, and some other large manufacturing towns. As a test we may mention that the numboer of poor relieved by the Leeds Board of Guardians last week was 12 loss than in the correspondlng week of 1856. Having referred to the working population in the aggregate, and also spoken of the general condition of the hands engaged in the eloth trade, it may not be out oi plar.e to quote the following observations, as to other branches, from the Lied,, Mercury of to-day:- "Tha laxtrade hmbeen good In Leeds for some time pOast, but during the current week the principal firms hase, as a matter of prasetee, reduced thetr working time to fve days a-week. " The silk trade ih exoeedivgly depreseL. The mlis In thls branch of manufacture are not working more than balf-tine. "The iron and machinery trades are seldom so soon affected by depreealoa as the textile manufactoes; both branohea of there inrortoat trades hwe continued good nearly to the present time. The forges are In full work, and many of the prinocipal roachine-makers are making tnU time * In a few ctbera, as orders now lu hand are oompleted, the hauds are reduced, altnough fuU time is continue. "The leather tr%Ae is also mode'ately weU sustained. Some oonElderable Government Ordern gfre good employment La the establIshments of some of %ke Drinelpal tarners znd shoe mauufacturers " The building trades are, perhape, sweU off as unal at this season ofthe ear.

The mercantile dlsorganization In Amerioa has forced I one manufacturer in this locality to ask for time to meet his engagements. The person alluded to is Mr. Edwin Hemingway, Brooklyn Mill, of Mirfield, manufacturer of carpets, blankets, rugs, &o. He has been doing a large buginess with Amerioa. A saeetin of his creditors took place on Wednesday at the Royal otel, Dewsbury. There was a large meeting-about 60 oeing precent. A statement of his affairs waS reade by his solicitor, from which it seemed bia llabilities were 23.0001., and the approxdmate estimate of his assets was about 38,0001., ahowing a surplus of 15,0004 The assets'conaist of manufactured goods, raw material, mill and plantk &o. Between 8,000. and 9,000. worth of goods are in America,-in his agent's hands. The stoppage hia been caused in consequeuce of his not being able to get money from America. A proposal was made t pay the creditors in full by three instalments, and in the meantime his estate to be placed in the hands of trastees under a deed of inspection, and this propoaition was agreed to. HALIFAX, Nov. 21. The market has been very quiet to day, and little busine-s has been done inany department. There is noreduotion in the price of wool, while ic is difflcult to maintain the late rates for worsted and yarn. Most of the mills in the town are running short time, the average being scarely two-thirds of full time. For many years past Measre. Crossloy, carpet manufacturers, have been so basy that they have foand it ecessary o put np one mill after another, till the works have attsined gigantio dimensions; but within the Ist few days they have also had to commence running ahort time, in consequence of the almost entire suspension of their extentive trade with the United States. NORWICE, Nov. 2L The shoe trade of this city continues more prosperous than might have been anticipated. Several countermands of orders have been received, but as large arreara have to be brought up there his been no cessation of employment at present. Probably, however, there is depression in store. It is stated that some of the manufacturers of the neighbourhood have begun to work short time. DUBLIN, Nov. 21. The Castoms' receipts for the week to Tharsday, the 19th of November inclusive, were 16,7742. against 17,645. last week.

RAILWAY IN2LZLIGENOR. WATERFORD ANn KrT.TRNwV The report of the directors of this company states that the receipta for the half-year ending the 29th of September last amounted to 11,0361., and the working expenses to 5,0601L leaving a balance of 5.976L The receipts for the corresponding half-year of 1856 amounted to 9,986!, the expenses to 4,7181., and the balance to 5,2611., showing an increase in the latter item of 7081. From the balance of 5,9761 is deducted 3,3631. interest on Government loan and debentures, leaving 2,6121. To this is added 1,1271., the balance from theformer account, making thesum to the credit of revenue 3,7391. In addition to this favourable result the working charges, which in the preceding half-year amounted to 33 45d per train mile, have been reduced in the past half to 29-93d. The sums paid for the accldellt at DunkAt, and carried to suspense account, amount to 5,7394, which wll be increased by a few trifling items yet to be arranged, when the whole matter will be submitted to the proprietors. The relaying of the line has been completed, and the permanent way and rolling-stook are in good condition. The joint accounts between this company and the Waterford and Limerick Company have teen submitted to arbitration. With regard to the sums borrowed from the PubliU Workg Loan Commissioners the report states that the amount to be provided for annually, under the modi6ied arrangements, including interest for the repayment of the loan, insat present 9,9941, and after the year 1869 (when the commissioners' first advance of 83,000?, wlll have been paid off) it 'will be reduced to 3,258I. Asum of123,000!. was originally borrowred from the Pablic Works Loan CommisSioners, which has been reduced by subsequent payments to 101,7181. Every exertion has been made by the board to meet the instalments payable to the commissioners, and with some success, as 21,29821. has actually been repaid, andthe whole itterest to the present date has also been discharged. There i8, however, a sum of 5,9171. now due, and a further sum of 93,9941 will fall due in the course of next year. The commlssioners have intimated their intention to seize and sell the line by public auction, and it has been with some difficulty that further proceedings have been stayed until aEter the meeting of the shareholders on the 26th inst. The whole c apital authorized amounts to 599,0001, of which 584,1471. hlad been raised, leaving 14,S21. to be raised. The capital account showfs that 584,1471. had been received, and 582,4301. expended, leaving a balance of 1,7171. SEVERN VALLEY. In consequence of the difficulty of obtaining money it Is proposed to abandon a considerable portion of the line already authorized by Parliament, and to confine the cun. struction to that part of the scben,e extending from the intended junction with the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverbampton line at Hartlebury, near Kidderminster, to Broseley, in Salop.

LONDON, MOVDA Y, NOVEMBER 23, 1857. It is long since America has had to pass through such difficulties as at present beset her. The unbroken prosperity, the uninterrupted progress of the New World, has long been a subject of pride for the Republicans and of reproach to the monarchies of Europe. Indeed, America has been so fortunate as hardly to have had a history, in the modern and somewhat sombre sense of the term. While France, and Germany, and Italy have been convulsed by revolutions; while Spain has lost ships, colonies, commerce, name, and dignity; while even England, though growing rapidly in material and moral power, has had to fight her way through wars and insurrections and "strikes," through the obstinacy of party and the prejudice of classes, America has seen the way clear before her, and has had only to build and occupy, to plant and reap the increase, to educate and receive the blessings of education. Indeed, so few have been the trials of the Republic, so easy and assured its onward march, that the people have become weary of their very happiness. Much of their occasional irritability, particularly towards England, much of their desire to turn every conversation into a channel which shall draw forth some compliments to America and ber institutions, much of their encouragement to Filibustering and such like excesses, arises from a feeling that the country's history is hardly great enough for her. Prosperity is not a sufficient substitute for glory. It is not enough to conquer the wilderness, to build vast cities where the Indian and the panther wandered within the lifetime of men still yolng; the A merican people seem to tire of this monotonous and uneventful prosperity, of the ever unclouded sky above them, and the unbroken smoothness of the path they tread. Such an event as the enforced idleness of multitudes who depend on their labour for their daily bread is something new on the American continent. We who have had in times past to suffer from such calamities, and who have even now great numbers among us who in age or sickness have no resource but public charity, can well feel for the misery with which the population of the Atlantic cities is threatened. The Irish and Germans, who form the majority of the labouring class, are hardlymore provided against the storms of fortune than their brethren who remain at home. They earn more and spend more; they are incomparably better off thau in the villages of Connaught or Suabia, but they have hardly in the first generation contracted habits of saving and hoarded enough to carry them through a winter of bankruptcy and suspended works. The American papers announced a few weeks since that some 40,000 men would be without occupation in New York, and that a great outcry, and perhaps a general rush southward, would be the result. By the last mails we have a description of the scenes which are now represented in the ' city. "Hunger meetings" have been held, in which banners, bearing in several languages the device " Work or Death," were carried in procession, and the multitude has been addressed by orators who proclaimed the duty of the comrnmunity to provide work and food for its members. It may indeed be a mockery to preach political economy to a starving man, but still it is certainly true that the knowledge and capacity of the working classes very much influence the arguments which are used on such occasions. In this country the artisans, even in the very depth of their distress, seem to acknowledge the true cause of it. We hear little abuse of the rich, little talk about the tyranny of capital and the rights of labour, and never an incentive to violence or spoliation. But it cannot be forgotten that the American cities contain a population which has been educated in other principles, and is not accustomed to let its acts lag far behind its desires. From the Parisian workshops, from the democratic districts of Western Germany, from Switzerland and Italy, have gone forth bands of emigrants who have notions of property very different from those which native Americans learnt from their English progenitors. The right to work, to food, to luxury, to happiness has been preached by philosophers and attempted to be realized by statesmen in the largest capital of continental Europe within the last ten years. The spirit and the doctrines which have been suppressed in Paris have free play in New York, and we cannot but fear that if extreme distress were to come upon the continental emigrants and their impulsive Irish brethren scenes of violence might follow which would require the serious interference of the State. That this interference would take place promptly and effectually cannot be doubted. We have no fear for the peace of New York and Philadelphia) nor for the speedy restoration of employment and wellbeing. The worst of the crisis is already past, confidence will soon be restored, the vast produce of the West and South will bring wealthL into the country, the merchants who have faUen wiU spring up again with true American elasticity, or their place will be taken by others; mills will reopen, work will be resumed on ships and houses, in docks or in brickkilns, and in another twelvemonth the panic and starvation of 1857 will be forgotten. Bat stll it is possible to look at things too much in the mass, and in our confidence in the community's strength to overlook the sufferings of individuals. We cannot but sympathize deeply with those who seem likely to undergo a term of great distress. That the benevolence of the prosperous may Ibe counted upon to relieve the want that will surround them is probable enough; that AIs powers may be equal to the task is our sincere hope. From the event, however, it may be permitted to deduce a moral, or rather a principle. The destitution of the Atlantic cities will remind the Americans how much their social condition is tending to similarity with our own. Hence, when they hear of poorhouses and begging and " strikes" in the old country they may leain to look with more indulgence on their neighbours and with less presumption on themselves. The fact which all recent history is teachingr us is the supremacy of economical over political laws. Forms of Government have, no doubt, their effect on mankind. Far be it from us to say of Governments " That which is best " administered is best." Liberty of speech and action can alone make nations permanently great; political slavery must produce in those subject to it many of the vices of slaves, and a rule which sustains itself by force and secrecy must have its hour of downfall. But ff political institutions influence all that makes life worth having they hardly touch life itself. Still less can such differences of government as distinguish England and America produce the great dissimilarity of the working man's condition on the two sides of the Atlantic. Wherever the population is crowded and the occupations are dependent on traffic there must be periods of distress and disturbance, in which angry passions are nourished and the lessons of common sense and experience are forgotten. The Northern seaboard States of America will probably have in their turn to struggle against many of the evils with which this country has so valiantly battled, and, though they will enter into the field with greater advantages than ourselves, yet their watch must be unceasing and their resolution firm. There is, however, a power in the Americans of amalgamating the races thet come among them which gives assurance that they will succeed even with the most stubborn materials which Ireland and Central Europe can produce.
At Warminster the other day Mr. Srmi-Ey l-itaBEiT gave the public the benefit of his official experience in some interesting remarks on the subject of recruiting. As regards the present urgency of this subject, we have before explained to our readers that the replacement of the Sepoy army in India by a dominant European force need by no means entail any such expansion of our military establishments as might, perhaps, at first sight be apprehended. For our estimates in this respect we have the best possible guidance in the events which have recently transpired. Take the most trying emergencies to which it is conceivable that our rule in India could be exposed, and see what force is actually required to meet them. Suppose an assembly of insurgents 2,000 or 3,000 strong, well armed and well disciplined, suddenly menacing the tranquillity of a distrlct; we know by the experience of Dinapore and Benares, and by the exploit of Major EYRE at Arrah,that a couple of hundred British soldiers would be perfectly able to disperse them. Take a stronger case, and imagine an organized body of 15,000 or 20,000 natives in arms, intrenched in a strong city, and supported by the stores of one of our own great arsenals,we know that 3,500 troops can drive them out headlong, notwithstanding all the resistance they can offer. As the most extreme example of all, imagine an en:ire province in insurrection against us, exasperated by our occupation of its territories, and presenting in disbanded soldiery, fanatical zealots, and rabble marauders, a mass of 50,000 fighting men,-it has been proved i' Oude that 500 Europeans can maintaiui themselves against the whole armed population, aud that 2,500 more can cut their way through aU opposition into the very centre of the country. Combining all contingencies together, and giving a broad expression to the results before us, we can say with perfect confidence that 25,000 British soldiers can hold Hindostan iu defiance of the most formidable rebellion which it is possible to anticipate, and that a moderate addition, therefore, to this force will answer all the purposes required. It is, consequently, impossible to maintain that the control and protection of India by British instead of native troops will be a task beyond our means, especiaUy as the aid of native levies will still be available to a large extent, though in a very different form from that hitherto prevailing. Nevertheless, although we do not regard the demand to be thus created as threatening us with any extraordinary or embarrassing obligations, we readily admit that for some time to come recruits will be much needed, and that Mr. SIDNEY HxBprBtR's observations were very opportunely delivered. Besides keeping the Army of India up to its proper strength we shal l have to replace by fresh battalions the regiments thus suddenly draughted from our shores. The rapid and satisfactory progress effected in this work has already been learnt from the mouth of the PRInnI MINISTER himself, and so far, therefore, we might be well content. The statistics, however, produced by Mr. SINEmY HimBERT tend to confirm the views we lately expressci, and to prove that the military service o' the CROWN is still, probably, not regarded with that degree of preference which its terms do really deserve. Of 1,000 recruits enlisted, it seems that 462 are Englishmen, 3G6 Irishmen, and 158 Scotchmen. These proportions, as Mr. HEFBERT remarked, show that England does not contribute to the military force of the country in a ratio representing that of her population, and the result, we presume, must simply express the fact that Englishmen of the class in question being better off on the average than Irishmen or Scotchmen are not quite so ready to accept the sergeant's shilling. But this conclusion amounts to nothing less than the assumption that military service is a service adopted as a last resort, when nothing else offers, and that a recruit for the army represents a lad in some strait or other, who becomes a soldier under the pinchings of discontent, if not out of pure compulsion. We fear such an opinion would not be without some foundation; in fact, the calculation made by some of our authorities, that recruits would come in more quickly when the harvest was got over and the pressure of winter began to tell, pointed to some such principles of reckoning. Yet we concur entirely in Mr. SIDNEY EHaBETa's assertion, and the experience of all employers of labour will, we are sure, bear us out in the remark, that the ranks of the army provide a better position, better treatment, better pay, and better prospects to the unskilled or but moderately skilled workman than any other kind of engagement generally open. The nominal rate of pay-although even this is superior to that of ordinary field labour in some counties-does not decide the whole question. To estimate the conditions of the service fairly the actual results shonld be taken, and these results show, in the place of an ill-paid, illodged, and hard-worked peasant, a well-attired, well-trained man, impresed with a due respect for himself as well as others, testifying in his very carriage to the dignity of his profession, and supplied in all respects with every advantage which reasonable expectations can desire. A soldier, it is true, earns but 7s. 7d. a-week in i money, but for 4id. a-day out of this sum he gets a pound of bread and three-quarters of a pound of meat of exceUent quality, and all his cooking is done for him. He has a good lodging weU furnished, he has the use of a library, opportunities of instruction, and mredical attendance in sickness. If he educates himself and behaves himself properly he has the chance of rising to a still better position ; and aU this he gets permanently, without any risk of "short time' or dismissal, without any favour, upon his own first application, and without the need of any previous training to qualify him for the engagement. We know of no such terms obtainable in any other employment. It has been thought that the system of "stoppages," by which the soldier, though receiving ani undoubted equivalent, finds himself deprived of the money earnings on which the terms of his engagement had induced him to calculate, may have tended in somne degree to impair the attractiveness of the service in gcneral. We are quite ready to believe that arrangements of this sort often prove a source of dissatisfaction, and in the army itself they are perhaps chargeable every now and then with some troublesome results. A correspondent lately ascribed the desertions from the 9th Regiment in Canada to grievances of this description. But we very much doubt whether the great mass of the agriculturists or artisans, from whom 90 per cent. of our recruits are derived, have ever so far acquainted themselves with the subject as to be impressed with the consideration of these drawbacks. We suspect that any indisposition really felt towards military service arises from utter ignorance of the truth of the matter, combined with the effect which certain lingering traditions of bygone times may still exert, and which the occasional urgency of our demands may seem to confirm. Considering the terms offered to unskilled labour in other directions, we cannot but believe that the army would soon command its share of candidates if the conditions of the service were but accurately understood. As it is, indeed, the patriotic spirit of the population, stimulated by the excitement of the crisis, has provided us with an ample supply, and it is well known that our resources in this respect invariably increase with the duration of the trial. As the Crimean War went on we obtained recruits in abundance; it was only under tEe first sudden pressure that we experienced any difficulties. As a matter of course a large damard of any kind, abruptly and urgently made, would be likely to find short supplies, but this disadvantage can be always guarded against by the prudent maintenance of a reserve. After that we think it would prove quite sufficient for the purpose if the actual conditions of service in the British Army were brought to the knowledge of the population in general. These terms must always be kept upon a level with those generally offered to the class of applicants likely to take service. At present, taken altgether, we believe them to be above this mark, and we are convinced that if they suffer in estimation,3 it is not so much from being insufficient or ill-devised as from being unknown, or, as Mr. SrnEY HERBERT expressed it, underrated.
The liability of the Indian Empire -to pay its own expenses by no means depends on financial considerations. If the local Government were impeded in the re-establishment of its authority by pecuniary difficulties it might possibly be necessary for the English Treasury to come to its assistance by temporary advances of money or concessions of credit ; but it is useless to inquire whether a great country can pay the cost of its own disorders or misfortunes. The question could never have arisen but for the connexion of India with England, and under native dynasties the inhabitants would have had to pay and to suffer for many wars and rebellions in the place of a single mutiny. In the early part of the present century European kingdomis inferior in wealth as wel as in population to MDadras or to Bombay found it possible to maintain large armies of invaders, and at the same time to pay enormous sums to the cnquering Government. In a single year the mutilated territories of Prussia were muleted by France in contributions equal to the whole revenue of India. In aU such cases nat-ons find the means of satisfying the demands which are enforced by justice or by superior power. In the present instance it is satisfactory to know that the burden may be borne, if not without inconvenience, yet without permanent finaucial derangement. Sir C. TREVELYAN, in h's evidence before the Committee of 1853, called a4tention to the surplus existing in the Treasury during some intervals of peace. The Burmese War dispoced of Lord ASin_ERsT's accumulations; Lord AucKri NaD spent more than Lord WILLIAr BExTnNcaC had saved; but many of the conflicts in wvhich we have been engaged have proved to be profitable investments, not only by direct acquisition of territory, bu' through the dectruction of form'dable neighbours, and consequent relief from the expensive vigilance which they imposed. In time of peace the revenue has proved itself moderately elastic, and there can be no reason to doubt that even the existing sources of taxation will gradually become more productive. Between 1834 and lSol tbs gross revenue of India had increased by no less than seven mill:ons, of which less than three millions were due to the newly acquired territories in Sclnde, in the Punjab, and in some other districts. Two millions of the augmentation arose from the opium cultivation; but after aU deductions nearly three millions remained to prove the growing productiveness of the country or the greater efficiency of the fiscal administration. The transib dues, abolished in 1836, had yielded a net revenue of more than 600,0001. During the same interval the debt had grown from thirty-nine to fifty-two millions, showing a large diminution of liability in proportion to the means of discharging it ; yet in those seventeen years the Government had carried on two campaigns in AffghaniLtan, one in Gwalior, one in Scinde, and two of great severity in the Punjab. Now that foreign enemies are no lorger to be feared, it may be hoped that the suppression of the mutiny will be followed by an unprecedented continuance of tranquillity. It is true that during the period to which reference has been made there was in the majority of years a deficit amounting, on the whole, to nearly twelve miUions; but the cost of the different wars far more than accounts for the inadequacy of the revenue. A Government which is only indebted to the extent of two years' income cannot reasonably appeal to the charity of England. The utmost extent of liberality consistent with the duty of Parliament would be the extension to a portion of any war loan of the guarantee which has been granted to holders of India Stock. Before even this demannd is conceded proof should be afforded that the native capitalists have withdrawn their confidence in the only public stockl with which they have hitherto been familiar. Only tro years have pas.sed since Lord DALHOuIsr efficled a reduction (f ijlterest from five to four per cent., and, although the policy of the measure has since been ztrougly questioned, no better proof can be given of the credit attached to the name of the Government. The hoards which have been laid up during the panic will, to a great extent, be forthcoming on the termination of the troubles which shook for a time the native faith in the fortune of England. If, however, it should be found that the aid of a guarantee is, on the whole, expedient, every care must be taken that the contingent liability is not converted into actual payment. Even if it should appear that the Indian Government is temporarily unable to raise a five per cent. loan, it undoubtedly possesses abundant means of providing the interest on any debt which it may contract. The larger portion of the amount will probably be advanced by members of the community which must eventually bear the burden. The accounts of late remittances to the East, as well as the known balance of trade for many years, zufficiently prove that of all commoditiea India possesses the largest comparative supply of specie. In some form there can be little doubt that the present crisis will ultimately strengthen- the Supreme Government, and the most vigorous Administration is in general the most economical. Sanguine politicians are already speculating on the saving to be effected by the annihilation of the Bengal Army; bat one English soldier costs as much as five Sepoys. At the present moment the relief to the finances is not even proportionate to the diminution of the military force. Many disarmed regiments are nominally doing duty on full pay, although they are not merely useless, but at the same time burdensome and dangerous. It is reasonable, however, to assume that the GovanRwoa- GENERAL and ComrMADE:a-Iw-CHiE have already devised measures for removing so singular and troublesome an anomaly. It is, perhaps, fortunate in one sense that the TJndian difficulty has coincided with the commercial panic at home. With discount at 10 per cent. there is no danger of any precipitate liberality on the part of the Government or of the House of Commons. The prophets of evil, who announced a general rebellion of the native population in July, are consoling themselves in November by declaring that the Government of Calcutta is bankrupt, and that not an elephant nor a bullock will be procurable without an immediate remittance from home. Happily, there is no reason to believe that any immediate pecuniary assistance will be required. But in any case the cost of borrowing or spending must fall on those for whose exclusive benefit it is incurred.

REPRESE,-TATION OF FINSBUY.-We are authorized to state that the reports respecting Mr. Duncombe's health which have lately appeared m a portion of the public press are without foundation, and that the hon. mem. her will not only be in his place at the meeting of Par. liament, but that his health is at present far better than it hrs been for some time past. MR. MECHI o02 AGBICuLTuRB.-At a meeting of the Coggesball Agricultural Society on Thursday ilst Mr. Mechi in the course of the evening rose and said an allusion had been made to his year of office and his return among them. They had all great duties to perform, but he assured them his heart came back with delight to the pursuits of agriculture and the varied objects of interest which it presented to the obeerver. He could not help comparing his position 14 or 15 years ago with what it was now. He then was considered little less than an impostor -or the promoter of some wild and visionary schemes, but be knew that he had strong prejudices to encounter, and that the truth would prevail. For instance, wben he put up a steam-engine, it was thought the most absurd act wbich he could perform; and now he had the gratification of seeing his neighbours possessed each of his steam-engine, and he heard of one gentleman in Chelmsford having as manyas 13, which he let out upon hire. The farmer bad row found itto his interest to cast away the filail, which cost Is. . as an instrument for thrashing his corn, and to uee a irachine which cost 3001., as, notwithstandin the enormous disparity in expense, the steam engine would produce a cheaper result. The other day he went down to Wandswortb, with Mr. Caird and Alr. Morton, to see a sebeme of railway adapted for agricultural purposes, patented by Mr. Halkett, by which he promises to plough land at a cost of Is. 7d. per acre, hoe it at Is. 3d., and get in the harvest at ls. per acre, carrying the mnanure &o.. of the farm at Id. per ton per mile, leaving a margin for the interest of the cost of railway, which could be adapted to the farm at a cost of 241. per acre. By this scheme he might plough his land by night as well as by day if he pleased, and if it were necessary for the production of a good crop that the land should be brought in contrat with tbe air they would see how important it was to have a long fallow. Mr. Mechifurther desoribedthenature of this implement, and expressed his opinion in favour of its practicability. With reference to the appropriation of sewage manure to the soil he said Professor Way had been sent to Milan for the purpose of examining the drainage, so as to adopt some scheme for saving the sewage of London, which was of immense val ae, but which now ran into the Thames and was entirely lost. He believed the difficulty presented was merely a test of scientific skill, and that it only required some mechanical contrivance to accomDlish the object. There were yet many things which might be done by agri culturists to great advantage, bat he could not forget how much some had done, and tbat there was one gentleman present who every year burnt at least 1,000 tonsof earth into ashes whichb laid unon heavy clay land, greatly increased its fert ity. His experience of French agriculturlits convinced him that they were not behind themselves in point of inteligerce, but he was also convinced of the vast superiority of Englishmen in point of capital and means, the cry of France being, "Where is the morey to come from?" Upon the qvestion of thin sowing he was glad to find a great change of publc opinion in favour of the adoption of such a plan ore bushel per acra was enough seed upon his land, and, though he would not lay that down as a principle, he wvould recommend them to try it, and he was certain of the result. He begged again to thank them, and be hoped that his frends would, as far as practicable to them, carry out any suggestWoa which he might have thrown out.-Essex and West Suffolk Gazettc. RESTORATION OF HiGiAm FERRBBS CHURCH.- As It may be inferred from the notice respecting Higham Ferrers Church which appeared in our paper of the 19th inst. that sufficiert funds bad beeu raised for the comple. tion of the wiork, we beg to state that the estimated expense is 6,0001., of which sum 3,2001. has been raised, leav. ing a eeflciency o' 2,8001. The great cost is attributable solelj to the immense size of the building. WAGES OF AoRICI'LTURAL SERVM&rTS.-The annual "statutes" for the hiring of servants in husbandry are now being held in various parts of Yorksbire. Owing to the depressic-' of prices of agricultural produce which has pre. vailed for sonre time past farmers have offered low wages, particularly for men and boys, whlch have not been very willingly or very generally accepted, and many farm servants are out of work. There is, however, ample employ. ment for the greater part uf them, and they will doubtless find places as soon as thev accede to the terms offered. The wages of agricultural labourers have all been reduced. During the range of high prices tbey were in receipt of half. a-crown a-day, or ISs. per week, wheat being SOs. per quarter. They are now receiving 3d. a-day, and in some instances fd. a-day less, the average price of wheat being about 50s. per quarter. THiE NEW ZEALAND GOLDFIELDS.-News had arrived In Nelson wbich created a very great sensation. It was to the effect that Ellis's party, consisting of eight men, had with two toms and a cradle got out of the Slate River nine pounds weight o! gold In one day. It was also stated that another party, consisting of three men, had got from the Dry River three pounds weight of gold in the course of ore week. The statement with respect to the nine pounds weight had been confitmed by a letter addressed to Messrs. Connell and Ridings, of Sydney by their merctntile friends in Nelson. Notwithstandin the incle nert state of the weather, rain had descended within a few weeks to compensate for the long drought of summer aud autumn. Success at the diggings is steadily increasing, and by every arrival of the local steamer successful diggers were returning with well-filled bags of the precious metpl. The accounts which they were giving of their goad fortune were iadecing others to go over and try their luck; and, as the crops were now pretty wel sown it was expected that another fortnight or three w ee would see onehalf of the adult malepopulation of Blind Bay diggin gold at the Aore-e. We also hh of new fields being aiscovered and worked, which shows clearly that the gold extends over a large tract of country. Up to the latest date the value of gold disposed of in Nelson Is upwards of 10,0001., but the quantity wh:ch his, in addition to this, found its way to Wellington or elsewhere there was no means of ascertaining, nor the value of that, which must be considerable, remr5ning in the hands of the diggers, Astralian and Ntw Zealand GaztUe.

EXTRAOPIDINARY CASF.-At the Avlesbury County Court, on Friday last, an important case was heard, and the facts involved the point whether the owners of hulls are permitted to turn them out without taklng proper care that they could not break through the fences and herd with other graziers' stock. The plaintiff was Mr. Sen?or, of Broughton-hall, near Aylesbury, a magistrate for the county, and a well-known grazier; the defendant being Mr. Self, the manager of the London and County Bauk at Aylesbury. The action was brought to recover the sum of 191. 19s., for damages from the negligence of the defendant. It was alleged that the plaintiff had, at great trouble, secured a pure breed of Devons, which were depasturing in a Geld adjoining Mlr. Self's grounds, in which was a bull, which trespassed on the plaintiff's grounds, and associated -with his stock-im consequence of whlch the plaintiff said a most valuable heifer, the produce of the bull which had won the prize at Norwich, and had rever been beaten, and a cow which he had bought of Lord Macclesfield, was in calf. He (plaintiff) said it was important that his stock should remain pure. He said he was offered 30 guineas for the produce of the heifer which was the cause of the action; but, owing to Mfr. Self's bull having committed the trespass, he sold the heifer anid calf (which ought to have been worth 401.) for 171. lOs. The witnesses stated that Mr. Self's fences were very bad. Mr. G. L, Brown, barrister, for the defence, contended that the case had nothing to do with the breeding of cattle, bat was merely a little bit of private quarrelling. It was said that -there was an assumed likeness between the calf and its su,pectad sire; but there was no daguerreotype, ana of course no likeness could be proved, lie contended, therefore, -that there was no proof that the plaintiff had sustained .iamage at the defendant's hands. He called upon the jury to give the paintiff the smallest conceivable coin ia uiJ satisfactioa for any conceivable injury hehad sustained. Various witnes-e3, including Mr. Gadsden, the extenalve auctioneer andvaluer, and Mr. H. Phillips, the well-known dealer of Thamse, were called on the part of the defendant, and they swore that there was nothing extraordinary in the breed -of the plainti's stock, and that the heifer and calf were not worth more than 171. or 18. Otber witnesses swore (In -OppOsition to what bad been urged on the part of the pbaintiff) that the defendant's fence3 wiere in good condition. His Honour, Air. C. Temple, summed up at great lengtl. 'noe jury retlred, and, after being absent about half-au. ,hour, found a verdict for the plain tiff,-damages Is. Imnmediately the verdict was announoed the court, which was densely crowded throughout the whole five hours the case lasted, rang with a shout the like of which has never, perhaps, been uttered there on any such occasion. It was, nowever, of course, suppressed by the officers and the Judge. CRYSTAL PAACE.-HALF-CBROWW DAY, Saturday, Nov. 2L-Admissions on payment, 452; ditto by season #ickoto, 1s3*5 tatg vIAtor8, 4*797.
AMERICA. LIVERPOOL, Nov. 2L. By the British and North Amaerican Royal Mal steamship Persia, Judkins commander, we ame in receipt of advices from New York to the 11th inst. She has brought $605,690 92c. specie on freight and I 69 passengers. On the 12th inst., at 9 20 a.m., in lat. 40 36 N., long 69 24 W., the Persia passed the Royal mail steanship Arabia, hence for New York. The fo11owing telegram from Chicago had created a great sensation, though the information was not considered very reliable *- " Mr. Williamson, correapondent of the St. Paul'r Timss, writing from Payutzac on the 26th ult., says that a report had reached there that 500 United Sates' troops, supposed to be a detaohment of the Utah expedition, had been at. taoked and killed by a large party of Teelowan Indians near Missouri river. Mr. Williamnson believes the report." Sorne of the papers, referring to the above, suggest that the Indians may have been instigated to attack the troops by the Mormons, or that they were Mormons disguished as Indians who committed the massacre. The demonstrations of the " unemployed" at New York had assumed a serious aspect, and occasioned much uneasiness. The "rowdy" elements were par. ticularly distinguishable. The Government had taken steps to check any outbreak by posting military at the Custom-house, Sub-treasury, and other important points in New York. One of the principal speakers at the largest meeting held was a Swiss woman, named Rank-, who talked at some length, and said she had come to offer her services " like Miss N ightingale going to the Crimea." She enunciated the idea that the nmob ought to make " friends of the editors," and counselled the avoidance of riot. The mob had divided into two parties, a split having occurred owing to the violent opinions of seine of the leaders. On one occasion, wben the appearance of the mob was rather threatening, the Mayor maustered what force he could, and a Brooklyn fire-engine took up a prominent position, prepared the hose, and caused the dispersion of the crowd. A deputation which waited on the Mayor was promised employment on some public works. The Board of Common Councilmen in a report on the state of distress among the labouring classes ascribed much of it to the large immigration of persons who remained in the city, instead of moving to the interior. The Board of Aldermen in their report condemned a proposition of the Mayor's to issue stock and purchase large quautities of food with the proceeds, to be sold at cost price to labourers on public works. Not content with reporting upon the immediate matter at Issue, the Board went into the question of the "present c2;sis " as follows:- "Your committee cannot permit the present opportunlity to pass without giving their views in refereneo to what is called the I present crisis,' and in endeavourlng to show by what they deem conclusive argament that the reWlsions ln trade, the depressions of aDl descriptions of labour, the apparent scarcity of money, and the various other causes which have conspired to bring about the presenat distress and suffering which are said to exist among the labouring and certain other classes of our citizens, are but temporary, and that in a short time, from the nature of existing oircumstances, the country will assume its wonted prosperity, and trade, commerce, and manufactures agatn resume their allotted spheres of usefulness, and confidence again take the place of the universal distrust now pervading all classes of our community. A comparison of the present revulsion with that which paralyzed the country in the year 18:17 will be amply sufficient, your committee believe, to satisfy the most sceptical that the present is only a temporary embarr'Esment. At that time ths whole country was impoverished. From Maine to Tezai, which latter was not then ours, we were dependent upon Europe for the very grain we used to support life-ar d we could only pay for it in specie and cotton-the first of which articles was immeasurably scarcer than now, as was also the second, for the reason that the absolute production of silver and gold amounted then, and for 180 years previous, to only $50,00, 000 per annum, through the -whole world, whUe daring the past 11 years it has amounted to $150,000,000 per annum, of which we have had more in proportion than any other nation. So much for the specie, except this, that iEngland and Russia, prior to 11 years since, owned in respect to the IJnited States specie as 10 to 1; nowv we are nearly even with them. Our cotton was even scarcer than specie, for the United State.' Bank had undertake to control the whole of our cotton crop, both that i-. hand and that coming forward, and from the foreign ad-,ances made to that institution, and others concerned v-.ch it, we found ourselves with a vast portion of that -deicle of payment in the hands of foreign owners. Fs-, three years previous we had had short crops, and whetn the crisis overtook us, in the midst of what was caled the ' great land fever,' the price of labour feil at once to Its lowest mnargin, while the prices of all the necessarJes of life were maintained at a high point, and even rose above it. The great labouring and artisan classes were reduced almost to beggary. That this was not consequent upon the 'great land fever' speculation is plain enough when It is known that lands in Maine, tour years afterwards, were sold and bouglit profitably at prices above the highest po;nt of speculation prices during the 'land fever,' and the same is certainly known of property in this city. The South at that time was perfectly bankrupt. " Look at the contrast. To-day the foreign debt of the United States is absolutely less than then. The South is not only out of debt, but absolutely rich. She owns her own cotton, sugar, rice, and tobacco, and adds nothing to the burden o0 indebtedness. The North is in debt, but the Immense surplus of her productions from harvests hitherto entirely unknown are amply sufficient to meet it all, and yet the prices rule lower than at any period for four years. " Then, again, the vast majority of our indebtedness is of such a character as really to amount to little. It is railroad loans, and these once confined to therailroads themselves, in the hands of their creditors, nearly all of our debt is ' wiped out.' The suspension of all our banks is a most fortunate circumstance, and it is to be hoped they will not resume until they are beyond the necessity of another suspension. The bank currency vwill thus be equalized throughout the Northern States, and exchange will be as abundant within 60 days between the East ead West, and rule at as low prices, as in any prosperous year. " Another erroneous idea is that luxurious living, extravageant dressing, splendid turn-outs and fine houses, are Ithe causes of distress to a nation. No more erroneous impression could exist. E2very extravagance that the man Of $100,000 or $1,000,00:) indulges in adds to the means, the support, the wealth o' 10 or 100 who had little or nothing else but their labonr, their intellect, or their taste. If a man oi $1,000,00X) spends princpal and interest in 10 pears, srd finds himself beggared at the end of that time, he has actually made 100 who have catered to his extra. vagaroee employers or employed, so much richer by the division of his wealth. He may be ruined, but the nation is better off and richer, for 100 minds and hands, wth $10,000 apiece, are far more productive than one with the whole. "The great truth apparent in all this criss, Is that It is simply what is called a ' panio.' It is universal dli. trust-every man doubts his neighbour's means, and has his doubts returned. The moment confidence returns men will look into each other's faces and feel ashamed that they allowed this panic to disturb the public mind to the extent it has. "T'he distress is merely temporary and urgent because so many have been suddenly thrown out of employment ; but ainTle provision can be made for the deserving at all times, ana the public may rest assured that the Common Courcil will tnke such measures as may be deemed needfnl in the premises; but the unemployed must forbear until such pro. vision can be made, and remember that the peace and good order of, society must be maintained throughout the orisis.,' In conclusion, the board pointed ouit some public works on which the employed might be engaged. The city comptroller had advertised for $100,000, as an ingtalment of $250,000 which was to be appropriated towards the employment of the destitute. The Navy Department had received despatches from Captain Sands, of the UJnited States frigato Suaquehamna, reporting that he left Plymouth on the 3tith of September, and, on passing the Straits of Gibraltar shaped his course along that portion of the coast of Barbary ';nown as the " RUff Coast," for the purpose of showing the United States' flag, as the Inhabitants were, with good reason, suspected of being piratically disposed. On nearing Cape Aqua a body of men, with horses and a few canoes, were observeed on the bluffs above. The ship was cleared for action and Captain Sands landed and brought four Arabs on board, from whom he endeavourod to gain some Information as to what these demonstrations meant. Captain Sands then made a drawing of the American flag, -which he shorred to the Arabs, tellng them that all attacks upon vessels carrying that flag would be severely punished. The visitors were also shown the ship's batteries and engines, and appeared to be deeply impressed with what they had seen and heard. A young woman had given herself up at New York to the police, and volunteered a statement- " That she was one of the girls calling themselses ' the Chain Gang.' Sbe stated thae the object of the gan wasto throw vitriol on obnoxious persons, occasionaIly stab a per son byway of amusement, and commit other ontrages. Vbe told the ofecer that a short time snce she killed a child of hers by stuffing cotton in its nostrils. 'The Chain Gang' held nightly meetings, and were consulted by various per. sons who desired them to act for them.", Heavy frezhets had ocourred in the Genesee, Susquehanna, and other rivers, occasioning great damage to bridges, dams, &c,, and in some places washing away railrray tracks. A t Phiadelphia on the 7th, in the Court of Commohi Pleas, an attachment was asked for against the property of certain well-known brokers, who, it was alleged, had been concemed with Mr. Aibone, the laWM President of the Bank of Pennsylvania, in using the funds of that institution. In the aiffidavlt lr. Ailibone Is accused of having " ab3conded to a foreipu country with ovez $2003000 of the fund5 which the depositors believed he intended defraud7 ing the institution of." Some time since the Ministers of Guatemala and Costa Rica at Washington addressed the Scretary of State, requesting bim to prevent a renewed invasion of Nicaragua. Walker, the Filibuster had replied by protesting as the " rightful and lawful executive of Nicaragua" against any interference with him, and denying any intention to offend against the rneutrality laws. Advices from Hayti to the 23d ult. report that coffee was beginning to arive at Port an Prince freely, and sold at $150 (EHaytian currency) ; logwood, $70; doubloons, $225. At Aux Cayes coffe was also arriving in sufficient quantities for the season, and was selling at $120 to $125; logwood, $50 to $75. According to the New YoT7h Conmeriol and S'ippig Lint things fnancial and commerial remained pretty much in statu qTo, with perhaps a very little better feeling. "Money," it says.- * Is pouring in upon us from all quarters, with but comparatively little going out, while we are positively doing an rnmense bnsiness in the way of exports of our leading staples; let we seem to ba standing in fear of something, we know not what. It is ttine that the elastio spirit, of which we have so often heard as a national characterlstic, began to exhibit itsel." Really prime business paper continued scarce, and all such was In demand both at bank and note brokers' offices at 15 to 20 per cent., according to maturity, &c., while very good endorsed netes were selling at 24 to 36 per cent. Sterling exchange was gradually Improving, and good bills -were more easy of negotlation. The quotations on London were 6 to 9 per cent. ; on France 5f. 25c. to Sf. 32ic. Domcstic exchange showed an Improved feeling. Stocks were irregular, and the tendency at the close was towards lower prices.

The Bank statement for the week ended the jth exhibited a more satisfactory result than the former ones. It showed a gain of over $3,500,000 of speoie, an increase of $500,000 of loans, and an augmenltation of deposits to the extent of $4,500,000. The current week had opened w.dith a rising specie average. The following is the Bank return: The New York Times, alliuding to the accumulation of foreign goods in the bonded warehouse at New York, says:- " It svwells the total now in bond to $37,421,882. This l?rge sum in the apparent debt of the country to Europe is m no sense properly due. The goods have not been taken for consumption, nor will not be at anything lAke the orgiM nal invoice cost. They mostly belong to the foreign manu. fe-turer, represented by his factor or agent here, and ia the present condition and prospect of the Amerloan market they will not fetch over 60 per cent. or three-fifths their value, if so rmuoh, ineluding tbe custora daties to be paid on tl-elr withdrawal from bon2. There Is nearly as much more of foreign goods in private store in this city awaiting a market." The suspension of (. and A. Ives, private bankers at l)etroit, is reported. The New York Expr?ess, under the heading ' Better times Comring," says:- "The Unlon Mannfacturln, Company of Norwalk, and LounBburry, Bissel, and Co., whose works have been suspended several weeks, have recommenced operations. They employ a great rumber of hands. The tool factory, in Greeflueld, Massaihnsettq, which has heen closed for some weeks, has again been opened and commenced work. The Rensselaer ironworks will be going again in about two weeks; they employ 350 men. The Albany ironworkswere to commencs operations this veek." The Bank Comptroller of Tennessee had made a call upon the Free Banks for an additional deposit of 10 per cent. in bonds, as security to the note holders. The New York Courier and En quirer reports that the commercial advices fromn the interior were elmost entirely without exception favourable. The money-markets of Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and Cincinnati, had decidedly improved. In the West generally exchange was more abundant, and the rates were less exorbitant. "This," says the Courier and BEuirer- "Will have a favourable influence on New York by making collections less difficult. It is almost an unmistakable evidence that produce is being more freely shipped to the East. For somue time the prices of produce In Baltimore have wairanted larger shipments than to any ether port, and this, in connexion iIth the large premium at which New York exchange is held in Baltimore, has rednced Baltimore and Philadelphia oebcange to par in the West generally." The rates for money at New York had slightly declined. The banks did not extend accommodations beyond those who had an undoubted right to call on them for ald. The Courier and Fmuptirer says that the shipment of gold to Europe should not be taken as evidence that the current of exchange has turned, but rather that the excharnges are irregular. We shall receive rmore specie from Europe for some time than we shall export, and this. in addition to our receipts from California, will make us stronger in this line than ever before, The New York Custom-house returns for October showed a substantil c decline in the Imports of merchandise, as comparedwith the corresponding period of 1856 anld 1855. The Ne.Z; York Shipping List, alluding to the returns, says:- " Thus it will be seen that the commercial revulsion has already made itself felt, though a more marked effect will probably be discernible in the retusas for the ourrent month. For the calendar year so far the hmports are largely in excess of the two preceding years, but if the entries continue, as at present, light, the year's Imports will be but little above those of 1856. We should not omit to note one important feature in this connexion-viz., the large falling-off In the reeeipts for customs, ca ised partly by the deorease In Imports and partly by reduced duties, under the modified tariff of the last session. A Governrment loan is regarded by many as inevitable. It is quite certain that whatever may be the extent of a favonrabte reaction in our financial affairs dming the ensuing fiscal year the revenue will not meet the expenditures.

The present accumulation of country notes would be carried by the city banks until the 1st of May next; one-fifth, however, to be taken up each on the 1st January, 1st of February, let of March, 1st of April, and lBt of May. Interest at the rate of 0 per cent. to be allowed after the 1st of December. The proceedings were understood to look to an early resumption, provided the arrangement was aggraeable to the country banks. It was understood that several of the bank presidents were in favour of resuming specie payments on or before the lt of January, but they were largely in the minority. The hardware merchants of New York had adopted the uniform standard of four months' credit, to commence on and after the 1st of January next. The importers and commisIon merchauta of Philadelphia had concluded to reduce the tern- of credlt two months, and were selling goods on tlioFi term2J bnut the jobbers had not yet come into the arrangement. The demnand for ashes waa good and the receipts light. Pot, $7 25c.; pearl, $6 S0c. There had been more inquiry for cotton for export, and, owing to the continued ackwardness of the receipts at the shipping ports, prices had advanced to 13c. for middling Uplands, and 13jc. fo, ditto Gulfs, In the face of a slight appreciation in freights to Liverpool. Flour had been irregular, opening lower on the 7th and reacting subsequently to the prices of the previous day. The receipts had continued to be large; but owing to the steady demand, both for home use and export to Great Britain, there was but little accumuLWtion of stock. "Owing," says the Shiing and Corn mercial List,- " To the lateness of the fall, it is now almost a fixed fact that inland navigation will close upon a Bmaller stock than weo bxve been accustome6d to enter the winter upon oi late years. Notwrithstanding this hs the season that the railroads leading to the seaboard are overwhelmed with bread. stuff freights, it is remaried that they are at present carry. ug bat a comparatively smLl quantity. This is accounted for by the tact that forwarder have not sufficient money to pay the freights." The quotations were, per barrel :-State, common brands, $4 80 to $4 85; State, straight brands, 4 85 to $4 90; State, extra brands, $5 to $5 20; Michigan, fancy brande, $4 90 to $4 95; Ohio, common brands, $4 90 to $5 10; Ohio, fancy brands, $5 20 to $5 30; Ohio, fair extra, $5 50 to $5 90; Ohio, good and choice extra brands, t6 to $6 75; Michigan and Indiana, extra brands, $5 to 6 50; Genneasee, fancy brands, 65 30 to $5 50 ; ennessee, extra brands, $6 to $7 50 souri, $5 75 to $8; Canada, $4 90 to $6 70. iVheat was without quotable change, except for the commonest qualities of Wisconsin and 1llino;s, which were one to two cents lower. The demand had contin-ued active mainly for shipment, so that the receipts, though large, had been nearly all absorbed in the exports. There was almost an entire cessation of business in iron. Prices of molasses had slightly improved owing to the good demand for home use. Crude turpentine was quiet; spirits of turpentine had further declined. Common rosin was in moderate request. Pork was rather firmer; beef dull. There was a pretty active demand for sugar from the trade and refiners, and the business had been large, but prices continued depressed and favoured buyers. There was scarcely anything doing in tobacco from first hanlds. There was more activity inl freights, the offerings of flour and grain for Great Britain being large; to Liverpool, for grain, 8d. in bulk and 9d. in ship's bags; flour, 2s. to 2s. 3d. per barrel; cotton, o-32d. to 3-16d. _~~~~~n
IJ1je INDIA AND CRINA MAILS AND IPrASSENGEBS. SOUTHAMPTON, Nov. 2L The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Indus, Captain R. W. Evans, arrived here this morning, wIth the heavy portion of the Calcutta and China mails, irn charge of ldeutenant Lloyd, R.N., Admiralty agent. Her sailing dates are :-Alexatdria, November 7; Malta, 11; and Gibraltar, 16. The Indus had fine weather as far as Gibraltar, and thence to Lisbon thick, with hard squaUs, heavy rain, and much thunder and lightning. She made the Needles about 3 o'clock this raorning, but the fog -was so dense that she could do no more than feel her way slowly so that she did not get up into dock till 10 a.m. Tnis steamer brings a total of 104 passengers, sad on freight 14 packages of specie, value 22,500 dollars, gold value 11,600U. sterling, 2,130 bales of silk, 51 cases of shawls, and 114 paekages of general merchandise. At Alexandria were Her Majesty's ship Tartarus, the Russian screw frigate BalkAn, and the Russian brig of war Pheloktisz. At Malta were Her Majesty's ships Royal Albert (flagship of Admiral Lyons), Hibsrnia, Conqueror, Centurion, Princess Royal, Vnlture, Wanderer, Vigilant, Boxer, and Harpy. At Gibraltar Her Majesty's ship Curlew. The Peninsular and Oriental Comapany's steamer Ripon, with the outward India and China mall of the 4th, from Southampton, arrived at Gibraltar shortly after 11 p.m. on the 9th, and resumed her voyage to Malta and AlexandrLa at 10-30 a.m. on the 10th. The Tagns arrived on the 14th, In 6 days 16 hours fromn Southampton, calling at the Intermediate ports. The Dutch brig Cornelius, vAith a cargo of barley from Trieste, bound for Valparaiso, went ashore off Panta Mala at 1 p.m. on the 13th inst., but was got off again and towed Into Gibraltar Bay on the following morning by the Earl of Lonsdale steamtug. The British steamer Tiber, Captain Wardell, 6.1 days from Liverpool, with general cargo for Gibraltar, Palermo, Messina, and Trieste, arrived at Gibraltar on the 14th. Exchanges at Glbraltar were quoted as follows on the 14th inst. :-London, 90 days' date, 502; Paris, ditto, 5f. 35c.; Marseilles, ditto, 5f. 36c.; Genoa, ditto, 5f. 37c.; Madrid, eight days' sight, 15 dis. ; Cadiz, ditto, par; Malaga, ditto, 9 dis.; Sevi11e, ditto, $ dis,; Alicante, ditto, A dis.; Valenda, ditto, .

His Excellency General Don BIas Pierrard y Alceda, appointed by the Spanish Government second In comamand in and over the dependencies of the Philippine Islands, embarked on board the Ripon steamer at Gibraltar on the 10th inst., accompanied by his lady and two aides-de. camp. There are a few persons from the disturbed districts (principally ladies and children who have lost their husbands or their fathers) among the passengers by the Indus, but nothing caling for speoial notice transpired respecting any of them. Mr. Alderman Firnis (the late Lord Mayor of London) and his indefatigable lady were in attendance, as well as the local authorities, but happily no case requiring relief was discovered. The next steamer due here wlth passengers from India is the Ripon, Captain Dandas, on the 4th proxlmo.
THE LATE FATAL ACCIDExg rN IHuxTLG.-A inquest was held at the Old Star Inn, Baruby Dun, on Fri. day afternoon by Mr. W. Marratt, coroner, on the body of the Hon. Martin Hawke, who sustained a fatal accident in the hunting field on the previous afternoon, as reported in Thee Times of Saturday. From the evidence adduced at tha. inquiry it appears that at the time of the accident the hounds were in full chase and the pace very severa. The fox skirted the vilage of Bramvwith, and led a ortiorn of the field over a lpiece of newlymade ground wa recently stubbed up plantation about six yards -wide), which had a fence on both sides. Mr. Stanhope Hawke, brother to the deceased, cleared the double jump, and his brother, who immediately followed him, got safely over the first fence, but, instead of going straight on, the ground beinr lght and bad, he rode down the strip of land and put his horse at a line of posts and rails drawn with larch tree boughs. The horse succeeded only in getting his forelegs over the rails, pitched his rider off head foremost, and then turned over upon him. Mr. Stanbope Hawke and others, who witnessed the accident, speedily pulled up and released the sufferer from his painful position, and had him removed to Bramwith-hall, whence be was afterwards taken to the house of Mr. Newsome, of Barnby DLn. Mr. Russell, surgeon of Doncaster, shortly after Attended thse unfortuntte gentleman, and, after cuttlng off his clothes, found that he had three ribs broken on each side, the broken ends having ruptured the lungs. He was aslo very much bruised about the head and face, and his left arm was broken a little above the wrist. T)Fe deceased never spoke a'ter the accident, but he moaned very much, especLally as he was being removed from the field and conveyed from Bramwith.hall in a canlage, with a view to get him to Doncaster. The deceased's horse, after it was raised up, followed the hounds for four or five miles without a rider, taking aU the leans with the foremost of the field. The fox was eventually run to ground in a sovgh at Hatfield, the chase having lasted 55 minutes, over a strong and awkward eountry, with which the deceased was not weU acquainted. Mr. Martin Harvey-Hawke was third son of the third Baron Harvey-Hawke, by FrAnces Anne, daughter and sole heir of Air. Stanhopo Elarvey, of Womnersley-park, near Pontefract. His father assumed the surname and arms of Harvey in Addition to those of his own family. The deceased gentleman was horn in 1806, and was 52 years of age. -e -was unmarried. The first Lord Hawke was the celeratd Adira of hatnamewhobeat the French fleet inerthe Westndiesa inf 1747, lanmdin1759achieved a decisive vctory over the French ileet, for wvhich he had the thanks of Parliament and a pension of 2,0001. a-year. Hle was ereated Baron Hawke in 1776. Theremains of the decease gentle. 3can were rewroved on Saturday to Womereleyforinterment. The jury returned the following verdict :-"We find that the deceased, Martin Harvey-11awke, was lled by a fall from a horse whiie hunting."

I BRB BISHOP OF OXFORD ON CHUROH MISSIONS AND THE INDIAN EMPIRE. An able lecture on the sub-jct of Church missions, with especial reference to Tndiax was delivered on Tuesday evening at ReAding by the Bishop of Oxford, The popalarity of the right rev. prelate is so great in this part of the country that people ilocked to hear him, and the spacious hai was s0 thronged that hundreds were unable to obtain admission. The BISHOP having remarked that he had been requested to speak on the subject of Church missions, especially as connected with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, said,-In entering upon thia wide field I think we ought first to take a few general considerations into account as to why it Is thae -we ought to be a missionary people at all; why we ought not to be contented with having our own blessings at home, and trying to make our own people better-and God knows there is work enough to be done in that way to occupy a whole generation-why ,we ought not to confine ourselves to that, and why we should, instead of doing so, be endeavouring before we bave become perfect at home to try and carry the know. ledge of Christ throughout the world. The first reason is a very simple one. It is this-God's way as we found it in the beginning of the church, when the holy Apostles, ful of the goodness of the blessed spirit began to work, was not that it should be made perfect at home, but that it should be spread everywhere at once. And that reaUy to a ChrLstian man is a sufficient answer. We find that the first apostles, when there were a great many evils to be overcome ia the church where it had been already planted, instead of waiting till those evils should have been corrected, spread themselves over the face of the whole earth to bring in the masses who had never heard of the faith. And the reason for this was Plain enough. Never in any way are we to auppose that even the Gospel of Chrlst itself will bring all who hear It Into the fold. On the contrary. Yon know perfectly well that our blessed Lord has left to you an universal rule that even where the Gospel was preached lit is, comparatively spealdng, the few whom it possesses so thoroughly to make them new men; whereas the majority, from the love of this world, reject it in its purity. Therefore if we were to wait, knowing that, it never could spread at alL But, on the coitrary, every new place in which it is preached, where it lays hold of a certain number of souls in its power, is to become a new centre, from which it is to shoot forth into the darkness. Just as when boys take the burning wood which they have lighted, and in the darkness strike i' agaist romething. and you see the sparks flashing and spangling, and shooting themselves into the thick darkne_s around, so it is with that light of the church. It is to strike against heathenism, to dash its sparks of life on every side around into the thick blackness, and it is, where It lights upon congenial hearts, to do even as those sparks do-to light up another fire, which fire in its turn is to be a new centre, fromi which centre again is to be cast forth into tbe darkness again until at last the Gospel has been preached to all nations under Heaven. Now, you see that this is the begining. And then not only have we here in this, as they of old, the pattern and the example of the first church, but we have the distinc v words of our Lord, because He foresavr all these difficulties, He knew that man would be slow to believe. He knew that the few would be gathered together. He knew-who better than He who wept as He did over hard-heerted Jerusalem ?-He knew the hardness of the beart of man, and the difficlby of bringing It to its true peace. And therefore He laid down the rule " Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature." And therefaoe, observe, we come to tWe conclusion-that whereever His gospel is planted there It is the duty of those who have received it-even though as yet at homne it has by no I means asserted Its undoubted supremacy-it is yet the duty of those who have received It to pass on that word of truth to those who have as yet known it not. And I think, my friends, that it always appears to me to be a very remarkable argument, because It shows the oneness of the God of nature with the God of grace. I think the whole of nature around us, when we corne to read it in the light of Christianity, is a sort of parable expounding its truth to us. There is nothing good, there is nothing great, there is nothing living that the God of nature has given us in this world which does not by the very law of its own being impart itself even in its own existence a condition and law of existence to all things that are round about it. Look at the sun; what does it do? Fancy the sun In the firrament not imparting lIght, colour, and life, 2ud all the means of vegetable lsfe to everything in this world. Fancy such a thing. And what have you fancied? You have fandced the extinction of the sun because while it Is the sun God has sent it to rule in the natural heavens it must by the very law of its being impart itself, and its colour, and its light, and its living I influence to all things that it can reach in this universe (applause). Look at the stars which spangle the sky. Look at the moon waiting the interval of the sun's rays to cast its glory on this planet and those who dwell therein. Look at the fountain of water which breaks out from the sides of the hill-look at that water as it sparkles and descends down the hill side, breaking from rock to rock-look at that water murmuring and dancing along its pebbly bed, and ask yourselves why It is thst it is unlike the water that is dammed up in some deec sepulchral pool, covered with weed and scum, and avoided by living creatures, because of the pe tileutlal vapours that are bredfrom its unclean breast. (Applause.) Why is the differenee? Because the one is imparting to every animal, every bird, and every vegetable thing which is nourished round about its track, and the other is beddedup in its own obdurate selfishness and imparts itself tonothing. And so It is if you examine It through nature. What is the growth of the corn bat the same law -life imparting its influence to all which can be profited aud fed by its increase? And so I say the law of nature bears exactly the same stamp with this law of grace, both of them coming from the same God and the same Lord. To have is to impart. There Is no secret for preserving it In Its purity but this one,-spreading, increasing, thxasting itself forth, ministering to their souls, giving of its own plenty, falfdlingthe wordof the great Lord, "Freelyhast thou received, freely do thou give." Here, my friends, is thevery beginning. A Church of Christ founded anywhere must, if it is to keep for itself the pure faith of Christit must be an imparter of that faith to those who have not got it. It is planted in the world for t-his purpose. It is under the action of this, its original charter, it is bound by this as its great original condition, it nrust give as the condition of keeping this what It has received. And now then, to come from this general proposition to the history of the particular effort -with which we have to do. You may ask, how was it possible, whereas the religion of Christ was planted in this kingdom of Great Britain so many hundred years ago, that this society can only date, at the f uthest, 200 years back ? A grave question, and one worthy of being answered. Why, brethren, this was the reason :-In this country, as you know, until a comparatively recent period, a part of that great western Christianity, which ouly in Rome bad its centre, had spread itself over the west of Christendom, Now, among the many corruptions o, that western cburch at that time, this was, perhaps, the head and very much the cause, in one way, of all the others-that earthly ambition had continually tended to gather up in the City of Rome, in the bishops of Rome, aud in the hierarchy of Rome all tbe power of the Christian Charch wbich owned in any degree subjection to Rome. It Is quite impossible to conceive anything more clever, more asLute, more exhausting to the powers of the human mind, then the mulblplicity of means, touchiog family life, tmching political Lie, touohing civil life, touching the civil law of nations, touching, of couse, pre-eminently ieligious life, than that whole series of expedients, and rites, and arguments, and facts, and arragements by which RIone hrd continued to draw to itself, as the only lIvlng centre of action and of thought, all the energies of every peop!e that had subinltted themselvos to her spiritual domination. (Loud applasse.) It was very mech, indecd, like what you see in the autumn time, when you may perceive a vast, intricate web banging frora the side of one tree down to the shrub below, every one of. those single threads conducting to the same central point, and that central point with one single thread from it eleding to the place where that cunning insect which has divided the whole eits ready to bring its presence by an almost omnipresent readiness to every part of that great web, so as to sairo aS its own prey that which coumes into any portion of it. (Loud applause.) That is the history of what Bone was. I don't mean to say that there were not those connected with it who were in many respects good. There were. We never do the cause of truth good by undervaluing the other side. In times of great barbariby-in times when robber chieftains disputed with tyrannous subjects the command of all those western kingdoms, no doubt there was often a shelter for the poor-a shelter for the oppressed, and a shelter for learning and virtue under this vast colossal ecclesiastical power which had been raised up, and at that time was the only opposite influence to the violence and oppression which had spread itself so widely over the earth. But we are here to deal with one particular point. The effect of this is to show you that Rome had drawn to itself the whole machinery for discharging its great duty on the earth-the evangelizing the world. Every thing wvas to go forth from Rome. Tbewhole machinery was there. There was the body which governed every attmpt in every part o. the wiorld to send oat a mission to heathendom. Itwas the centre of themighty web. There could not come efrom the Enalish church, nor from the French church, nor from the Belglan church, or any other espcial church-there could not go forth any such efforts, because each one of those who was moved to such efforts was bound to go with those desires to Rome,as the fountain hesd, to receive from Rome his mission, and to go forth from Romre. Aye, and remember that the people of Great Britain were just as much possse by that belief as any other part o. the world, that every great appeal went to be settled at Rome, that every earnest man who was desirous to convert the heathen was drawn to Rome if be was judged worthy of the work, in order that from Riome he might be sent forth, And you w11 see tha5 the wrlole machinery was moved from the extremity. It was just like the little finger of a man endeavouring to think for itself whether it should go a journey to Brighton; if it did take such a step, unquestionably it would be crushed and severed from the system. And so would a*ny English Christian if he dreamt at any time of devisimg such a scheme as this without going back to the great centre; the only result would have been that he would be cut off from the eat system. (A laugh and applause.) Then when itpleased in His infinite mercy to grant that a purer light of a restored faith should rise np i this our land, when our fathers under the most Wonderful leading of the providence of God shook off that vDe yoke which for so long a tirme had failed all our religious endeavours, the very lust of one of the most proffigate and tyrmnous of our moarchs that ever ruled, by God's wise and bleased Providence becOme the occasion of favoring the true haty love of a purez faith, which at that time was slumbering in the breaos of tkosads of bis subjes. The powerof the ing did no more do it than does the pitchfork you put into some smoking heap which tbos moment you move it is ready to break uto,&famue-I say the Klingno more cause that break. ing forth Of the purer faith than the pitchfork ausd the bursidng forth of the flame. The fire had been tL-re sleeping, it Is moved, and then it leapr, up'with its thousand tongues and illumina.tes the dawknssa of the s'ky. It was the pitchfork which moved the mass, and allowed the shuinbering firn to declar itaelf. But mark what followedl. There came first of all years of struggle for the new reformed and perfect churoh, The fies of Smithfield every now and then broke out, seekisg to destroy the bodies of those who beld the truth, and from their fire lighting in the darknes55 roundesprang the puer repetition of the one great bri!ght light of Ch.-Mt's faitlu Then after that there was tha mighty revolution In the other dIretion, and the country was torn asunder by a return to the absoltute and lawless form of religion, whichi resented all fixed faith and fixed morals, And would have wasted itself in the barren assrtion of the duty of indivlduaIs to be a church in themselves instead of assmbling togethier under the faith of Christ's word and Christ's teaching. And thes great waves rolling upon the strad, first one and then Another, in their blackness occupied not only the civil and temporal hut the whole religions mind of this country for generations of men, until they had come clear, as things do come clear, by the settling down of the dregs, and the exhaustive process, by wbich it had, As it were, cleaed itself, As we know things do clear themselves'wheni they ferment and cast the scum at the top and the dregs at the bottom, and the good, solid, sound liquor comes out In the midst. (Applause.) And so it was with this people of EnglAnd. -and then it was that they began to look around, anfdthey found this, that they had no mission, no way of teachlinz the heathen man, that they were spreading thte gospel nowhere. And why? Because, mark you, the mnachinery was at Rome; they had never been used to do anything fOr themselves. Anid so when we were cut off, when we were severed fronm that old Roman connexion, aUl the missionary agency which hitherto we had been akble to use was cut off from us by the saine bolow which severedl us from the corruptions of that greatly superstitious bd.Anid so there was to be formedl again for us as a churh, a new machinery throuigh which th-is work of Christ was to be carried out. It was riot until about two oesittries ago,when this nation ha~dso settled down from all those vast turmoils and difficulties which belonged, first of All, to the old superstitious faith, and theni to our wrenching ourselves fromi it at the Reformation, that the minds of good people bega to tutrn to the need of this external exertion. And thefis beginning of it was among a few pious laymen In the church of England. I am bound in Justice to say that the mnovement began with the laity rather than 'with the clergy. One mnan especially, of noble birth-all honour to him as a philosopher and as a Christian-a man ahead of his generation by many degrees-Boyle by name-he was the original suggester of the Christian Knowledge Society, which was the first beginning of any movemuent in this our reformed land, among ay set oI'r denominaio.n of Chitans for ' spreading the truth Among the heathenx peopl abroad. His Lordship then proceeded to trace the h.ry of the Christian Knowledge Society, the Gospl Jrpaato Socliey, and the Church Mlissionary Society, al o .wih had spruxng from the same parent stein. Their various labours Were glanced at, and ithe history of the church of England missons was brought down to the present century. His Lordship said he did not proposee to deal with any other societies than those he had mentioned ; the field ofltho church was occupied by them ; they had a distinct vocation for their ministry, anxd could work At home with perfect unity. He intimated that he did not approve any other missionary societies coornected with the church, because he believed those in question were sufficient for the work; they had their machinery in full operation, whereas, in the establishment of other societies there was only a waste of that money in paying secretaries and agenits, rent of house, stationery, printing, and advertisements, and deputations, whichi oughit to go towards the great object of spreadingtruth abroad. His Lordship thenL proceeded to ray, -And now let uLs turn to that part of the world which fills so many hearts at the present time-the great peninsula of Irdia. Men used to talk of it as possssn a population of 150,000,00, but the recent attempts of our overnment to esimate the ppulation have shown that we cananot estimate it at less than 180,000,000, and it is very probable to all thoughtful minds that there are 200,000,00 in that great peninsula, Hindostan. I ask yout is not that a field large en,ough for us? 'Why, we raise in the church of Englandfo these two great societies something like 200,001 a-yea*rl. Two hundred thousand a-year, and 200,000,000 of people to whom to preash the gospel. And remember, lth Glospel is to be preached, men muzt be sent, and they must be supported, and there must be books and means of transit. Therefore you sae our endeavours are, as it were, buat a dlrop in the ocean of our wants, if you take but that one country into account. BuLt you may add to that the -whole of Africa, New Zeala-nd, the labourm that are requisite among the few remaining North American Indianz, and miany other placs. We have thiewe colonies and dependencies, from whksh as centres of light, from whichL as garrisons of faith, there ought to go forth onL behalf of England and on behalf of England's Church a message of salvation, and ~he ministry of thLe Word convertinig the heathen to the faith of C.'arist. Well then, m3y friends, here is the great call to suoport this society, and here is the great field for it to labour in. its instruments are those of the church of Eng. land, and nothing else. It belongs to no peculiar colour or view in it. It takes the greatest care that its agents shall he the colour of the chzurch of England. (Loud applause.) Insetod of leaving to any commaittee, who may represent this or that colour, power of choosing missionaries, it leaves to the two Archbishops of Canterbury and York- and the Bishop of London to name from year to year clergymezn of the church of England-to be its missionaries, in order that there may be no possibility of its giving a sectional or inarty tone, hut that it may represent the church of England as it ts-be it in its strength or in its weakness, be it as it was of oldin itslanguor, orhbeit asit ianow, thankc God, in its awakenin)g strength, (Applause.) It seemis to; mthatiissacl necessary to add a word, to show you tha Itbeong t evryChristian member of the church Of Engandto o smetingto help us in the church. And surly f eer her wa atime when God himself took up thstext and preached to man on it, it was at this momentit was; with regard to our colonial empire; becauise you can-. not have read those judgments that have come upon us inL any other light than this. My friends, if you come to con-. Isider that now for 100 years we have possessed that empire, and we have as yet done very, very little for our God_nay, that we have used it as a means of political advancesnent, that we have used it as a mneans of gaining wealth for our own land at home, of providing for our own children, of making ourselves great among the people of the earth,and if we were swept off that maighty peninsula to-morrow' we should scarcely leave behind us, in any part of it, a mark, or tract of our having been a Christian people, that one thing alone condemns us. And if you go into the detail of the history, the condemnation only becomes more signal and black. The one ruling feature of our whole admninistration in this respect as to doing anything to encourage the faith of Christ or to spread His truth has been a most unEnglish timidity. (Loud applause.) More un-Enslish, becaiuze whereas In all other respects new we speak our mind, we say, " Let what will comje of it, we will speak our minds." (Loud applaase.) But we have not spoken ouar mrinds about that; we have held our tongues about our being believers ina Christ. Nay, I Pm afraid we have done more.We have been building our might to a great degree upon the basis of heathenism. We have showni, as I think, unworthily for a Chrietian nation, respect for many of the very worse formns of heathen Idolatry in that laznd. (Appla-ase.) What do you thinkof such things as these-of our having sent in the name of the king on the throne cloth fromi the looms of Leeds to offer as a native offering to the accursed idolatry of Juggernaut ont its most solemn day? How could heathen people douibt hut that we mnean' to do honour to that idol? How could we make them beieve that Christianity was for them as well as ourselves their beller faith when they saw us as~ curin idolatry in its wrorst forms? gi,sc at athsdpriving a corporal in the East India Company's sexvice of his rank and potting him out of theo regiment because he had been converted to Christianity, one of the best soldiers in that army, one whom most respected, and one whomn his heathen fellow-couutrymen desired to see conatinued among them after. his conversion, butt whom, vwith ani extraordinary timidicty, we relusedl to allow to return, lest any heat-hen man should he offended atbhishaving become aChristian? What do you say to our so dealing -with a noble Christian genxtleman, who had gone outt to head outr troops in onie of our Preidencies upon the express condition that he should never ha called upon to psy honeto idolatry-I mean SirlPeregzine Mai' lazd ? Bocause hTe refused to allow th e altar of thxeir detestable idol to remain with the troops, or to be longer saluted by them, he was obligedl to give up his.command and retunm to England, as though he had commnitted some dishonograble action, instead of allowing that he had done one which entitled hhu. in It,; consequenres 'to take his p lace among Christs confessors, upon the vesy margin of the nohie army of His martyrs (Louid applause.) Here has been our folly, our mistaken conduct. Many of you knowv something of caste in India, andi perhaps some of you do not ; therefore for your information I will say a few words on thesnuebject. Caste in India Is this :-ln tueo first p lace it Is distintyareligious difference ; that is the baad ofit. It assumes as its foundation this first great lie, and a. mest poisonous lie, that God has not mnade all mena of one blood, but tbat men are In their original differ. ence sospe made to serve and othiers made to govern. HlisLordshipwventfully into the distinctions observedlbetweeu the Brahmius and the Sudra, and then proceeded to sayCan you conceive any schbeme more vile than that miiserable uoLtire ? Tse peop'e of India were divided. by it. They were led to hate one another as only the Evil One could havie led men to dream of being. Surely you can conceive what our conimard ought to have been-to throw every discredit we could, consistent with truth and honour, on this miserable distinction. But what did we do ? We built on that very caste distinction the fourdation of our Indian power. The Bengal armiy was ordered to recruit only from the Brahmin race, in order, as we thought, that It might be a more trustful body. That was the Idea. But how has God fulfilled the old trad!tion of His people, that when, instead of leaning upon Him, they leant upon Egypt for support, It should be as wheen a man leaneth uion a staff and it runneth into his hand and plerceth him I Hiow has God, through this Brahicinical superstition, allowed these people to rise agains' us in their heathen fury and darkness, and ferocity and bloodshed-those whom we thought to snake through that heathen superstitlon the Instruments of our getting their bretbren in subjugation I Now, then, I say, if this is so, and really I beHeve It,---for we might carry it out further by ma utlltude of detailswhatis plainer than that the Chrigtiarn mind of England ought to rise tndertbe.edisters, put the true interpretation oon. them, and say this is the cause of England's disasters, that England hzr been false to England's faith and timid of arofring England's God ? (Loud a plause?) And, my friends, you may do so In a mesure through this very so. clety.

MWiNPY-MARKBT and CITYINTELLIGRB CE. Saturday Evening. The English funds opened this morning at the fir prices of yesterday, and, owing to continued investments of sums which the public are withdrawing from other channels, a further improvement subzequently took place. After regular hours a relapse was caused by a report of a fresh banking difficulty in the north, but although the name of the establishment was unhesitatingly mentioned in all quarters, nothing transpired up to the close oF busines to justify the statement, the London agents of the bank In question being without the slightest intimnation of any default having occurred. The fact of the Bank of England having sent a supply of sovereigns to one of its northern branchee In the morning was cited in confirmation of some new alarm having arisen, but the remittance was merely such as ismade at stated periods in the ordinarycourse of transactions, and had no connexion whatever with any prospect of approaching disaster in the rneighbourhood. From the boldnem of the report, however, it seems scarcely possible that it can have been altogether unfounded. Should it prove to have been a fabrication, every effort should be made to trace it to its source. Consols for money were frst quoted 89i to J. From this they advanced to 90, and the closing official prices were 894 to 90 for money, and 90i to i for the 7th of December. At a later hour there was a fall of nearly a quarter per cent., bargains being entered into at 90 for the account. Loans on Government securities were readily obtainable for short periods at lower rates, and the recovery of mereantile confidence made further progress notwithstanding the serlous features of the Bank return. The improved feelIng is to be attributed almost entirely to the absence of additional diffieulties in London during the past three days, and the liability to an extension of panic has still been such that the principal banking institutions would have incurred a grave responsibility if they had suffered any mn1ehi;f to take place which was fairly preventible. On the whole, however, with one or two exceptions, there has been no disposition to narrow conduct of that description. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 88a to J; New Three per Cents., 881 to J; India Stock, 212 to 215; India Bonds, 46s. to 35s. discount; and Exchequer-bilLs, 14s. to 10s. discount. In the course of the afternoon the news was received of the Persia from Now York h'aving brought back 120,0001., or exactly half the amount she took hence on her outward passage. It was likewise announced that the New York banks were still adding largely to their specie, that they were discounting more freely, and that stocks were rather higher. There has been an active demand for foreign securities and a general advance has taken place; Turkish, however, closed slightly flatter. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 98 ; Chilian Six per Cents., 101.; Danish Five per Cents., 102; Mexican, 18g and #; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 75; Portuguese, 43i ; Russian Five per Cents., 105i and 106; Sardinian, 89 ; Spanish, for the account, 411; ditto, New Deferred, for the account, 25i; Turkish Six per Cents., 87i and 88; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 97k; for the account, 97ft; and Belgian Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 95k. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 90c. for money, and 66f. 95c. for the end of the month, showing in the former case an improvement of about an eighth. About 400,0001. of Australian gold and 10,0001. of gold coin were sold to the Bank to-day. The Peninsular and Oriental Steamer Indus has brought 16,1001. While the Persia was coming in to-day with 120,0001. from New York the America started with 22,0001. for that port. A final decision has been obtained against Mr. Edmund Denison, M.P., and his fellow-directors of the Great Northern Railway Company, in their attempt to repudiate the rights of the preference shareholders, so as to throw- upon them the losses from the Redpath frauds. Of the exhibition made by Mr. Denison throughout the affair the public need not be reminded. A sufficient example has been enforced. and no public man is henceforth likely to commit himself in a similar way. But the opportunity must not pass without attention being called to the illustration the case affords of the wrongs which directors having con. trol of public companies with millions of capital can at any time inflict on individuals upon whose claims they may choose to trample. In the present instance justice happens to have been obtained, because a few persons -were found aufficiently bold to encounter the necessary outlay. But ninetimes in ten people under such circumstances submit without a thought of redistance, and even on this occasion it was at one period understood the contest was about to be abandoned. Every one saw that the moral question was clear, but the prospect of success against opponents w.ith unlimited funds, determined to take advantage of every technicality of the law, and to carry the struggle from court to court so long as there was any power of continuing it, seemed almost hopeless. If the cause had been that of a single shareholder, redress would, of course, have been impossible. The question, therefore, arlseswhether Parliament should not make provision for a compulsory and Inexpensive arbitration in every such case, allowing the arbitrators, If they see fit, to refer it to the regular courts, the company then paying the expenses on both sides. Subjoined is an abstract of the railway intelligence of the week :-A meeting of bondholders of the New York and Erie has been held to devise measures for preventing the foreclosure of the property. This step is threatened by an American creditor for 260,0001., by which he would obtain control of a line that has cost nearly 7,600,0001. Strong disapprobation was expressed of the system pursued by the directors of executing mortgages without the consent of shareholders, and creating a large floating debt. A committee was appointed to negotiate with the board upon their proposal to raise 600,0001. to clear off outstanding liabilities. A dispute has arisen between the Taff Vale Com- pany and the ironmasters and coal proprietors of the district upon the charge for carriage of coal under the new Act. At a meeting of the Monmouthshire the dividend declared was at the rate of 5 per cent. The receipts for the past half-year show an advance, but the worldng expenses have increased 2 per cent. from exceptional causes. The reserve fund now! amounts to 9,2501. A special report of the North British has been issued upon the measures prepared for the session of 1858, the most important being the Hawick and CarLisle Junction Bill. At a meeting of the Great North of Scotland resolutions were passed in accordance with the report. The principle adopted by the Board with respect to branches Is to make none themselves, but to subscribe to any that may be proposed by the inhabitants of the districts where they are needed. The directors, acting on this principle, intend to support the Formartine and Brechin line by a subscription of 60,0001. An agreement has been entered into between the Stirling and Dunfermline and E3dinburgh and Glasgow, which will put a stop to the existing litigation. The sie of the Blackburn Eadlway to the Lancashire and Yorkshire and East Iicaahire Companies has been agreed upon. By * Pliamentar return lately published It sppears that the total amount raised by shares or loans for railway purposes was 307,594,0861. at the end of 856, while the total length of line opened for traffic was 8,710 mile. Some difficulty has arisen in the private liquids. tion of the affairs of the London and Eastern Banking Corporation, which has led to its acceptances, to the amount of about 17,0001., being refused payment 'o-day. The liquidation was being carrled on by the aid of advancea from the Oriental Bank, but some shareholder of the London and Eastisr has petitioned for a winding up in Chancedry (although it is said he was originally one of the consenting parties to the other arrangement), 'and th'e Oriental Bank have consequently been advised not to lend any further assitance. The petition is to be heard on Tuesday. Amid every movement connected with this concern, the suspicion arises that Colonel Waugh and his infamous confederates wil Btill contrive, through some legal chicanery,to escape all punishment. The following information respecting the mining business of the week is condensed from the Mining ,Tournal:- The mining share-market has been more active than fur some weeks pat The demand haa been chiefly for small speculative shares, but good progresive mines are also Iiquired after. The dircttors of the Devonshire 'Great Consolidated Copper Mining Company have db cared a dividend of 8,1921., being 81. per abare.

'Thejudgment of the Vice- c rllor was to the effect that the plainti1ii and other holders of preference stodk were entitled to be p'al dividends 'out of the profits realized by the coanpany from the 30th'of June, 1856, before any payment of dlvid6nds to the hollers of' 6e-' ordinar original stock, XX A.oik or the B stock, oat of such profits; and that A peipeatual' unctionu bi ed to - restrain the defendanti from Wdclaring or paying any dlvid dend upon the ordinar?_ original stock without regard to the rights'of the preference stockholders to be paid in priorttyJ' their dividendl from the 3Sth of June, 1856.

From this decision the company, on behalf of the'ordinary shareholders; appealed. The other facts df' t4e case sufficiently appear in the ]Lord Chancellor's 'Judgiient. 3Mr- Daniel, Mr. Calrns, Mr. Speed, and Mr. Turner appeared for the preference shareholders; and the Attorney. General, Mr. Rolt, Mr. Denison, and Mr. R. Clar'ke (of the common law bar) represented the ordinary shareholders. The LoRD CE1cuiLo. now delivered the judgment ot the Court, and said that the Important question to be determined turned upon the constraction of several Acts of P4. liament, as there vere no facts in dispute betweeh the par-. ties. The company was formed in the year 1846 by Act of Parliament; the works were proceeded with, 'calls' were made, and' lage"summ of money subscribed for carrying on the undertakdng. Previous to the year 1849 certain shares of the company had become forfeited by reason of the calls not being paid, and the directors made a report to thbat effect, and at the same tirhe~ recommended that there should be issued in lieu of each' forfeited share (the number of which was therein stated to be 26,534) two scrip shares of 12. lOs each; that tho'se 121. 10s. scrip sharem should hane credit for 21. l(h as a deposit paid thereon, ind should bear interest or preference dividend at the rate of 51. per cent per annum in perpeuinty. On the 7th' of June, 1849, an extraordinary general meeting of the company was held to consider the report of the directors, and a resolution was come to c6flrxdhgg the forfeiture of the 26,534 shres, and authorizibi the directors to sell or dispose of them by cancelling at their discretion, and in lieu of thent to issue scrip shares of the amount and in the manner pro posed by the report of the directors It was, however, considered doubtful whether the resolution oould be carried into effect without the aid of an Act of Parliament, ahd: probably that doubt was well founded, and, consequently: enabling clauses were introduced into an Act relating to the company vhich was then pending before Parlisment, and which recelved the Royal assent on the the 1st of August, 1849. By the 25th section it was enacted that in Ae, case in which It should happen that the market price of shares which might be forfeited for non-payment of calls should be such as to render it impossible for the company to seU the same so as to realize a sum equ4al to the arrears of cals due upon the same, it should be lawful for the company to cancel the same shate; and to issue so many new sharesy and of such nominal aumount, as they might think fit, provided the capital to be represented by such new shares should not, in the whole, exceed tho capital represented by the unpaid portion of the shares whioh should be so cancelled, and any such cancelling of forfeited shares and issue of new share sinceRhe 5th day of June then last, in accordance with the now e'ated provision, were thereby confirmed. By section 26 It was enacted that it should be lawful for the company with the assent of three-fifths of the votes at any general meeting, to guarantee the payment of divi. dends not exceeding in any case 71. per cent. per annum on any particular shares which the corn. pany might by any of the thereinbefore recited Acts bi authorized to issue in preference to the payment thereof on the ordinary shares of the company, and upon such term s as should be by the resolution of such meeting defined ; and it was thereby provided that any such preference shate3 which should have been then already issued by the company should have a preference or priority of dividend over ths shares so guaranteed as aforesaid; and that all preference shares should have priority of dividend according to the date at which such shares should have been issued. The proviso In the lattor part of the 26th section was introduced ez mcjori cauteld, it being a rule of Parliament to insert such words in any Act extending the power of a company, lest per incuriam injustice might be done to the rights of other parties. In pursuance of the before mentioned resolution, and in conformity with tha terms of the Act of Parliament, now shares were issued tu a large amount. This was the first creation of preference shares. As In many sdmilar undertakings, it was found necessary to raise more money for the purposes of carryinu into effeot the objact of the company, and accordingly from time to time Acts of Parliament were obtained, enabling the company to issue fresh preference shares ; and, although the words in the different Acts were not predsely the same, theintentandmeaningof thomwereIdentical. In1851au Act received the Royal assent by which it was enacted tha, it should be lawful for the company to raise, by creating new shares, in addltion to the sums of money which they were already authorized to raise, any further sum of money not exceeding 750,0001., to be applied In completing the undertaking of the company. The fifth section gave power to the company, with the assent of three-fifths of the votes at any general meeting specially convened for that purpose to guarantee the payment of dividends not exceeding in an? case 71. per cent. per annum, In preference to the paymena of dividends on the ordinary shares of the company. By another Act, passed in the year 1853, the company were empowered to raise by the creation of new shares a sum of money not exceeding 750,0001., to be divided into shares of 101. each. and to bear and receive dividends at the rate of 41. lOs. per cent. per annum in preference to the payment of dividends on the ordinary shares of the company, subject to a power in the company to redeem the same, upon six months' notice, at a premium of 101. per cent., as sanctioned by the resola tions of the general meeting of the company held on the 26th of August, 1852, and confirmedbya subsequent meeting. The last of the A ots of Parliamen t, giving the company power to Issue preference shares, received the Royal assent on the 2d of July, 1855, and It was therela enacted that it should be lawful for the company to raise, b oreatlag laew shares, any further sum of money not exoeeding in the whole 1,000,0001,, to be applied in oarring 6n the undertaking of th e o mapany. By the 4 th section it was enaoted that the holders of th e sid, u=r,e should be entitled to the payment of fixed dividends imorn at the rate of 51. per cent. per annum in preferenoe to the payment of dividends on the ordinary shares of the company. In pursuance of all these Acts of Paliameent preference shares, if they might be so called, were issued by the company, and the certificates for each issue, though not in exactly the same form, were suabtantlay the same. T Tli certificates for the first preference stock were in thbei terms: -" 51. per cent.

Th9se rights were; as far as the preference shareholders were cqncerned, a half-year's dividend on their stock according to the rate menationedir their certicates, provided there had been a dpclaration of. dividend at the preceding half.yeaTiy heefDg, ;t ,he present case there had been no such declaratfot of dividend, and therpfore the preference share, holdeis *oula bc entitled to a year's dividend unless there Wau 4ythinQ the Aet of last seion which took away suchriglit. The irst aid second sections of that Act did iot touch'the question. The third section, bowever, enactedc - "That It any balatce should remain of the aid sum of Â£243,923 6a. td. after smch applcation theref as hetreinbefore dlPeeted, it shotld'be lawfal forthe dfrectoMs and they were thereby requei oepa, ly syuchbtalaeas Â¢Xfar asthe same wouldextend ia p- Ing to the proprietorsof the several csae of preference shares or stock .the dlivcendA to which they woul havd been entItled out of the seUd &um of Â£-14.9 O 5s. 8d., If the samne had beeu deslLred and apportoned ae dilvdead at the half.Yearly meeting of the 12th of Mareh, It was contended on bebalf of the ordinary shareholders that tho effect of this claus was to confine the right of- the preference shareholders to dividend upon their stock for the half-year ending the 31st of December, 8u6, o the balance that remained after paylng the losses lncurrd through Re<dpath's frauds, bat what foundation `was there'for s^dhanargument ? Ee (theLord Chancellor) would nedt say that if the Act had expressly provided for the case in that way it could have been considered unjust, as the Act itself waa.professedly a compromise. Therefore If the egislature had distinctly stated that such surplus should be divided between the preferenoo shareholders, and be conetidered as payment to them of their half-year's dividend to the 31st of December, 1856, it would of course be cted tpon. Buttthe Legislature had sid nosuchthing. Presuming he wasright in holding that the preference shareholders were entitled to a whole year's dividend in July, 1857, irrespctlve 9f the'Act of last session, he was clearly of opinion that .snich right had not been taken away from them by that stitut,. It was a maxim in law that no rights of individuals could be taken away except by an express eunactment to that effect. The only object of the third clause was to appro priate the surplus, if any, after payment of Redpath's frauds, in the same way as if a general meeting of the oompany had appropriated it; and it waa impossible to suppose that the right of the preference shareholders to a dividend was to deped u,pon an accldent whether or not there should be any surples-a circumstance which was quite uncertain at the time of the passing of the Act There was, therefore, nothing in the Act to deprive ht preference shareholders of their right to a whole year's dividerid on their stock since the 30th of June, 1856, the date of thblastdeclarationof adivldend. Thispoint was all that particularly concerred the parties to the present suit; but the decree itself went furtber, and declared that the preference thssreholders were entitled to be paid alU arrears of dividend at the rate specified in their certificates, without being limitea to one year, before the ordinary shareholders could receive any dividend whatever. It became necessary for this. Court to consider whether that declaration by the Vice-Chancellor and the consequential directious were correct, and, after much consideration, he (the Lord Chancellor) had come to the conclusion that the decision of the Court below was quite right. The contention on behalf of the plaintiffs was that they were entitled to carry over any arrears in the payment of one dividend to the next division of profits, whenever it might occur, until the vhole of their fixed intetest had been paid; while, for the defendants, It had been argued that the preference shareholders could claim no more than the division of the profits among them so far as they would extend, and had no further claim if such profits turned out to be insufficient TF at was not so ; for although the word " preference" was an equivocal one, and did not define the rights of She shareholders, yet it could hardly be said to be inaccar,te, as it meant that a certain class of shareholders were to bave some preference, hut how far such preference extended must be ascertained by other means. It had been said that dividend was ez vi termini, and could only aeply to the fi.nd from time to time apphcable for division. Now, in strict lauglnege, what the sbareholders were entitled to was not dividend, but a share of a dividend, and in construing the various Acts it must be interpreted in this, its secondary meaning. With this view he had come to the conclusion that the Aots had given the preference shareholders a permanent charge for their stipulated interest on the profits of the company, and that the ordinary shareholders were entitled to nothing until such stipnlated interest was paid in full. The strong ground upon which he relied for the correctness of his conclusion was, that if it were not sotheLegislature would have placed the interest of the directors in conflict with their duty to the sharebolders. The 122d section of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act enacted that, "before appropriating the profits to bo divided among the shareholders, the directors might, if they thought fit, set aside thereout such sum as they might think proper to meet contingencies, or for enlarging, repairing, or improving the works connected' witl the undertaking, or any part thereof, and mlght divide the balance only among the shareholders." It must often be a nice question to determine what sam the directors ought to set apart under this authority, and the way in which it was exercised might have the effect of exhausting one half-year's profits, and by that very outlay materially increare the next half-years. If, therefore, the rights of the preference shareholders were llmited to the half-year's profits it would entirely depend upon the directors whether they received any dividend or not-a state of tbings never intended by the Legislature. Wheu, ther.- fore, it was seen that by one construction of the Acts the diectors might be placed' In a position where their duty would be antagonistic to their interest, and by the other construction such an anomaly would, be avoided, he had no hesitation in holding that preference shareholders were entitled to be paid the rate of interest stipulated for in their shares, not simply out of the profits existing at the time when the dividend was declared, whetber sufficient to pay them in faull or not, but out of auy fund applicable to dividend whenever there happened to be one. By this construotion there would be no inducement for the directors at one time to set a side too large a sum to meet contingencies, or declare a dividend whenthe amount out of which it to be paid was too smalls and therefore upon all points he agreed with the decisiou of the Vlce-Cbancellor, that the plaintiffs were fully entitled to the relief asked for by their bil If, however, he had besn of a different opiinon upon the last point, It was beyond all doubt that the preference sharehoelders were entitled to be paid a year's dividend out of the profits to July, 18U7, and therefore the appeal must he dismissed, with costs. The Lords Justices MNIGHT B BuuC and Tusi-M al5so delivered judgments entirely concurring with the Lord Chancellor. Appeal disiissed with costs. * IcOROBSO N Y. EBARL D O ON.

Mr. ANDEssoN, who appears with the Attorney-General and Mr. E. F. Smith for the plaintiff, ocoupled the entire day, and has not concluded his address. (Before VTie-Chancdor Sir J. STUART and Mr. Justice CRESSWELL.) MARRIAGE AT ALTONA WITE A 3lEOrASED wFE'S SISTER. BROOK V. BROOK. The hearing of this case, involving the validity in this country of a marriage in 18M1, at Altona, In SclIeswlg. IlIostein, where such marriages are said to bevalla oi a ,In ti his deceaed wife's sister, was resiamnd. Thb ques. UIoI arses betw-een the children of the late Mr. Biook, of Xelthiim-ba, ieiv Adecmalad, on the one band, anu tho Crown on the other hand, as to the right to a share of the 2e03 and personal estate of Mr. Brook, bequeathed by him to a son by his marriago wIth his deceased wife's sister, such son sarviog died sinc the death of Mr. Brook. The case was opened on Ftid*y-by Sir F. Xelly. Ir. MALNS following Sir F .Eelly, for the plaintiffs, said tbat ita cAse of this klnd, where a statute mad an act unlaW. ful, it was nooessary that the provisions of the enactment 'shotld be express, in order that they should attachto British subject elsewhere than in England, Wales, or Ireland. In the Sussex peerage case, 1I Clark and Flin., 15n, 151, Lord Broughana held that the marriage of the Duke of Sussex was void, because he thought the words of the Royal Marriage Act, 12th George IlII, cap. 11, were clear, and added that be thoughtIt was necessary they should be clear in order that they niight aceumplish the objet of that At. " I say this," said his Lordship in that case, " becauso It is not a sufficient ground to hold that thie purpose ig clear unles the words are suffident to accomplish that purpose, otherwe the Act might have been nugatory. It was so in the case of the General Marriage Act (26th George IL, cap. 33). It waa quite dear that that Act was intended to prevent minors from marrying without consent unless with the publication of banns, and yet, notwithstanding tbat, by going to Sootland, a very short journey, the parties intended to be affected by the Act-namely, wealthy persone-could easly accomplish the purpoee and defeat the Act. My opinion is 'that if that Act had used the same phraeology, and had rendered the parties Incapable of eontracting matrimonT, we should never have heerd of 'Crompton v. Bearcroft (BuRars 2Visi Prius, 114) fup holding the validity in this country of the marrige n Scotland of an English minor without the oonsent of her guardlanl." If, then, the language of the Bioval Marriage Act had not been larger and more oomprehensive than that of the Marriage Act 26th George IL, c. 33, the former Act would, in Lord Brougham's opmion, have failed of its effect in the SusseX peerage case. It was no answer to the argument on behbalf of the plaintiffs to say that if this marriage were upheld by declaring the children legitimate the Act of William IV. would be eaiy evaded. for the Marrisge Act of George IL had been evaded as easily by parties going [to Scotland. Even asuming that it was the intention of the Legielature to prohibit marriges of this description by nglishmen wheresoever solemnized, they had endeavonred to accomplish their purpose by language so imperfect that opinions had been given by most eminent and experienced coenselthatthe Act did not apply out of EnglandorIreland, and that by going abroad as Mr. Brookhad done,andmarrying a deceased wife's sister in a place where such a marriage by the lex loci wasgood, b a marripge would be upead in this country, tnd the legitimacy consequently of the issue 'which was the fruit of it never for a moment questioned. IIn considering this case it should also be borne in mind that itwas one of affinity, and not of consanguinity, between which jurists bave always drawn a marked distinction. Mr. Justice Story in his Oonflict of Laws, sec. 115, aid:"The prohibition has also been extended in England to the narriage between a man and the sister of his former deceased wife, but upon grounds of Scriptural anthorit it has been thought very difficult to affirm. In may, and, indeed, in most of the American States a different rnue prevails, and inarriages between a man and the sister of his former deceased life are not only deemed in a civil sense lawful, but are deemed in a moral, religious, and Christian sense lawful and exceedingly praiseworthy. In some of the States the EDglish rule is- adopted, Upon the continont of urope meost of the Protestant countries adopt the doctrine that such marriages are lawful." The learn.ed counsel concluded by contending that the Act di4 notpreate any personal disability on the Part of Englishmen, wherseover they nivht be, whether abroaa or in tbis country, to contract such mamages as that the validity of which was now disputed, but that its operation was confined strictly to marriages celebrated in England, Waleo, or Ireland. Mr.G. L,Russmi., alsofor the plaintiffs, said thatit should not be lost sight of that it was not now asked to recognize the marriage of Mr. Brook with his second wife as between the parties to that marriage, and that It was not a case for the restitution of conjugal rights; but that it was a case in which the status and legitimacy of the chlldren of that narrisae -was caled in question after the death of their parer,t4 But for the Act of William IV. the question in this cue could not have arisen. Even if the marriage had taken )lace in England the question after the death of the paerits could not have been raised but for that Act. That position could not be questioned. The point was whether the marriage not having taken place in England, but haviDg taken place since the Aot of William IV. in a country where by the lez loci such marriages were legal, would be valid by the law of England. The learned counsel then referred to "Scrimshire v. Scrimshlre" (2 Hagg., 395), "Dalrymple v. Dalrymple" (ibid, 54), and other cases in support of the proposition laid down by Lord StoweU in "u Rding v. Smith " (2 Hagg, 390) in the following terms :-"It is true, Indeed, that English deci. sons have established this rule, that a foreign marriage, valid according to the law of the place where celebrated, is good everywhere else." There was no case in which a marriage which was good by the law of the country inwhich It was celebrated had been held to be invalid by the courts in England. If, then, it could be shown, as it had been in this case by the oertificate of the Chief Clerk, that the mar. riage was good where it was had that was enough, Thereason of that rule had been very well anunoiated by the late lr. Justice Story tConflia of Laws, sec. 121) as foilows: -" The ground, however, upon which the general rulo of the vali. dity of marriages according to the lex loci contractus is maintained is easily vindicated, It cannot be better expressed than in the language of Sir Edward Simpson, already cited ( 'Scrimshire v. Scrimshlre,' 2 Hagg Consist. H.. 395). All civilized nations allow marriagve contracts. They are jun-s gentium., and the subjects of allrnations are equally concerned in them. Infinite mischief and confusion must necessarily arise to the subjects of all nations with respect to legitimacy, succession, and other rights, if the respective laws of different countries were only to be observed as to marriages contracted by the subjects of these countriesabroad; andthereforeaU nations have consented or arepresumed to consent, forthe commonbenefit and advantage, that sueb marriages shall be good or not, according to the laws of the country where they are celebrated. By observing this rule few, if any, inconveniences can arise ; by disregarding it infinite mischief must ensue. Suppose, for instance, a marriage celebrated in France according to the law of that country should be held void in England, what would be the consequences? Each party might marry aueW in the other country. In one country the issue would be deemed legitimate, in the other iUegitimate. The French wife would in France be held the orly wife, and entitled as such to all the rights of property appertaining to that relation. In England the English wife would hold the same exclusive rights and character. What, then, would be the confusinn in regard to the personal property of the parties, in its own nature transitory, passing alternately from one country to the other ! Snppose there should be issue of both marriages, and then ahl the parties should become domiciled in England or France, what confusion of rights, what embarrassments of personal and conjugal relations must necesarily be created !" Ee would admit that incPst would form an exception to the rule laid down by Lord Stowell, in " Ruding v. Smith ;" but such a marriage as that in question was clearly not considered in. cestuous by the greater portion of Christendom ; for in the Papal States a valid dispensation would be granted, in order to enable parties to solemnize it, and could it be supposed that the Pope would grant a dispensation for the commission of incest ? Mr. Justice CRESSwVELL.-If these marriages were not voidable before tbe statute of WUliam IV. on the ground of incest on what ground were they voidable ? Mr. RUSSEL6. --They were clearly not voidable on the ground of Incest ; for, as the Act of William IV. rendered valid all marriages of that nature which had boen celebrated before the passing of the Act, that Act would bavo the effect of having rendered valid incestuous marriages if such marritges were previously voidable on the ground of Incest. If they were before voidable as being incestuous, the Legislature had said that those theretofore celebrated should, be valid, and had thereby sanctioned incestuousmarriges. If the Legislature had intended to create a personal incapacity on the part of Englishmen wheresoever they might be, it would have used words large enough for that purpose. On referring to other Acts which were in pari mal.rid, different and more comprehensive lanruage was used than that to be found in the 5th and 6th of Williae IV., cap. 54. That was the case witt the Marriage Act of the 25th of Henry VIIL, cap. 22, which in the 4th section enacted, "Thatno person or persens, subjects or resiants of this realm, or in any of our dominions, of what estate, degree, or di&nity soever they be," shall thereafter marry within certain degrees of relationsbip. In two Irish Marriage Acts, the one the 4th of Williama IIL, cap. 3. and the other the 2d of Anne, cap. 6, sswell in theRoyal MarriageAct of thel2th of George IL. cap. 11, equally comprehensive language was used. Could it be said that the absence of language equally comprehen. sive from the statuto of Wiliam IV. was unintentional wben it was found that wherever the Legislature wished to give effect to an intention they could find language to express such intention ? Mr. Blmsley, Mr. Cleasby, of the common law bar, and MIr. Pemberton were also beard for the son of Mr. Brook by his first marriage and other defendants in the same in. terest with the plaintiffs.

The other counts were alternutely specific and general, the 12th and last count being a general count for conspiring by false pretences to cheat and defraud several persons named of divers sums of money. The rules grantod rere for particulars to be given of the general counts; and a rule obtained by Sir F. Kelly on the part of Mr. Stapylton salted also for further particulars of the overt acts set out. Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, Mr. Welsby, and Mr. J. Brown appeared for the Crown; Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., and Mr. Aspland for the defendant Eadaile; Mr. Hugh Hill, Q.C., and Mr. C. P. Kennedy for the defendaut Brown; Slir F. Kelly, Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Coleridge for the defendant Stapylton; Mr. Serjeant Shea and Mr. Keane for the de.endant Alderman Kennedy; Mr. IL Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Sleigh for the defendant Vailant; Mr. D. Seymour for the defendant Cameron; and Mr. Lawrance for the defendant Macload. When the case was called on, Sir F. TussiGsR said he wished in the first instanoe to explain to the Court how it was that the Solicitor-General was absent on this occasion,lest it should be thought he was neglecting any duty which properly belonged to him. Doring the vacancy of the office of SoliCtor-General he (Sir F. Thesiger) had been applied to by the Attorney-General to conduct these prosecutions, and of course he at once consented and ssumed the responsibility. When his learned friend the Solicitor-General was appointed and found him in that position he in a very handsome manner deolned to interfere. He (Sir F. Thesiger) was therefore anxious that there should be no misunderstanding as to the cause of the Solicitor-General's absence, and that It should not be supposed that he was neglecting any paxt of his duty, which he admirably performed. Lord CAMPBrzL said that with that explanation the Court was perfectly satisfied on alU the points. Sir F. TulGsCsR said that although there were several rules, he should argee them all as one case, though it would be neoessarv to draw some distinctions. The rules called on the Attorney-General to show cause why he should not give a particular statement in writing of the charges intended to be made in support of the general counts, and also of the false pretences alleged in the 12th count; and there was another set of rules of a larger description, whichsoaught a description of the overt acts set out in the special;counts. If the Attorney-Goneial had thought that the defendants would have any difficulty in understanding the nature of the charges made against them, so that they might come prepared to meet them, he would have granted the fullest particulars, so that justice might he done. Bat he felt that the defendants were asking for that which they did not require for the purpose of their defence, and therefore he thought it ought not to he granted. It was difficult to distinguish the extent to which the right to apply for particulars in cases of this kind went. It was only lately that particulars were given at all, and that arose since the case of "Rem v. Gil " (2 B. and Ald., 204), in which it was held that a count for a conspiracy of a very general description was good. In that case the count charged that the defendants unlawfuUy did conspire and combine together, by divers false pretences and subtle means and devices, to obtain and ac. quire to themselves, of and from P. D. and G. D., divers large sums of money, of the respective moneys of the said P. D. and G. D., and to cheat and defraud them respectively thereof, to the great damage, &c. The Oourt in that case held that the conspiracy 'was the gist of the offence, and that the offence was complete, though the dofendants might never proceed to any overt acts. The learned counsel read the judgment of Abbott, C. J., to that effect. He then proceeded to discuss the question as to what particulars a defendant in a case of conspiracy was entitled to have, and he laid down the proposition that he was only entitled to know the sort of conspiracy with which he was charged, and not the specific facts by which the charge of conspiracy was to he enupported. It was manifest that a geueral count gave no Information as to the sort of conspiracy to be proved, so that the party could not come prepared to meat it. The Court: therefore said that when the conspiracy charged was of such a nature that the party could not tell what he was to come prepared to meat, the Court wrould confine the proaecutor by requiring him to give particulars. Here the 12th count w as in general terms. Lord CPu'nunL.-And my brother Crampton has ordered particulars of that to he given. Sir F. TIIBSIGB raid that was so. The test vas this. Did the information on the face of it convey to the defendants a sufficient specification of tbe charge of conspiracy which it vwas intended to establish against them 9 and was the nature of the conspiracy so pointed out that the prosecution could not, at the trial, proceed for a different conspiracy ? The defendants had no right to know the means of proof or what the evidence was that was to be offered. The defendants had made no affidavit that they did not know the nature of the charges, and that they could not come prepared to meet them ; therefore the Court must see upon the face of the counts themselves whether they did not give sufficient information to the defendants to enable them to meet the charges. Reliance had been placed by his learned friend (Mr. Edwin James) on the case of "I' v. Hamilton" (7 C. and P., 448). In that case the count for conspiracy was framed in so Tague and general a form that, under that count, any conspiracy to defraud and cheat might be established. But in this case it was different. The second count of the information charged that the defendants conspired to publish and represent to the shareholders of the bank that Its affairs had been during the half-year ended June 30, 1855, and then were, in a round and prosperous condition, they well knowing the cont'a7ry, with intent to defraud the said shareholders, &c. It was not necessary to give the particulars of the acts done by the defendants in puruance of the conspiracy, for the overtacts were the eviderce,or, as observed by Mr. Justice Buller, in " R. v. Ecclee' (Leech's 0. C., 274), they were the means to prove the charge. The case of B. v. Hamilton" did not reach this case, for there the counts were all general In that case Mr. Justice Littledale had ordered particulars to be given, and a summons was taken out for further and better particulars, and then br. Justice Littledaile said that he ought not to compel the prosecutor to state all the facts, but that the particulars sould give the ame information as a speclia count. Coupling the authorities together, the learned counsel oontended the first count would have been good without any overt act being laid, because, as Mr. Justice LUitledale sid, the overt acts were the evidence of the conspiracy. But in this cas the second count was the same as the first count, only omitting the overt acts. It was true the party ought to be prepared to defend himself by knowing the nature of the conspiracy, which he conld not be if the count were as general as in Gill's case, for almost any conspiracy could be given in evidence under that Court; but be was not entitled to know the means and acts, for they were the evidence by wbich tho charge was to be proved. The Court would see that in this case the conspiracy charged was of a defined descriptionthat it would be impossible to direct the evideneo so as to roveanyotherconiray. The count chared *the de- fend-nts with conspiring to misrepresent the aairs of the bank to the shareholders with the intent to deoeive and defraud tbem, so that if the defendants required more they required, not a specification of the charge, but of the means by which It ws to ho sosainpd.

-- CO66 T OF EXCHEQUER, SATURDAY. Nov. 21. NEw TRsL PAPER. V L-ULA DEATIK INSUPRA2IC VnAThIANV (.UiMmas tfl Banco.) Mr. M. C IAiBEBS, Mr. LvsH, and Mr. F. SmiTH showed cause against the rule for a new trial in this case, which bad been granted on the ground that the verdict which passed for the plaintiff at the last Maidstone Assizes for 2,0001. was opposed to the weight of evidence. It appeared at the trial that the action was brought by the plaintiff, Who is the widow of James Shilling, as the administratrix with the will annexed of Thomas ShiUling, the father of her late husband, to recover 2,0001. on a policy effected with the defendants for that amount. Some time before his death Thomas Shblling had been in reoelpt of relief, but, that having been refused, he had lately taken up his residence with his eon James, who was a comparatively wealthy man, and carried on business as a builder. Soon after the old man came to live with his son, proposals were made for his insurance from accidents with the defendants, and, as we understood, policies for 2,000L1 were effected, it being clear that the son wastheactingman in both transactions, he havirgaid, when speaking of his intention to insure his father's life, that he "should go in for 2,0001." The death of the father and son, for they both died at one and the same moment, and from one and the same cause, took place under the following circumstances --The son, having occasion to go to a stone quarry which was near to the railway and the River Medway, took his father with him, and, though the pony bad run away on a former occasion, left the old man alone in the gig at a gate in a lane, with the railway on one side and the open river on the other while he went to the quarry. While there he was cautioned as to the dangerous situation, and he left to rejoin his father. About that time a train came by, and the pony must have taken fright immediately on the son entering the vehicle, for nothing more was heard or seen of the father or son or pony or gig till the next day, when a search having been instituted the gig and the dead bodies of the men and pony were all found in the river, not far from the gate. The widow having sougbt to enforce the policy on the life of the father, whd had made a will in his son's favour, the office had resisted judgment on many grounds, but chiefly on a plea alleging that the policy was a wager one, effected by the son for his own benefit on the father's life, in which he had no interest, and as such was void in law. The jury having found against the defendants on this and on other issues of a more technical character than this, it was now argued in opposition to the rule that tlat finding was arrived at on a natural, proper, and reasonable view of the circumstances of the case; that the son had a clear interest in the policy as he had undertaken to support his father, who, bemig infirm and ruptured, was liable to accident, and one of the provisions of the policy secured to the asursed 71. per week by way of allowance in the event of any injury short of death occurring. No man could possibl have contemplated the extraordinary and appalling death of both father and son. Those tragical circumstances prevented the plaintiff from showing what private discussion ad arrangements might have existed between them on this subject, or much might have been disclosed which would go to disprove the plea of the defendants and satisfy the Court, as the jury (a lal one) had been, that the whole transection was bond fide, It was therefore submitted that the Court ought not to interpose and grant a new trial. Mr. Serjeant Shee, Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. Bushby were counsel for the defendants, but were not c;lled upon to support their rule, 'lhe CHIEF BARON, who had reported that he was disa tisfied with the verdict, stating that the Court was unanimously of opinion that the verdict could not be allowed to stand. Rule absolute for new trial. (OS'Wings at NfS Pliu, before Mr. Bamn MAnR-m ani Common Juies.) BATEMAN V. MAYOR, &Q., OF ASITON-UIiDHR-LYNR. This was an action brought by the plaintiff to recover a sum of 2021., for work and labour, and for money paid for the defendants' use. The defendants pleaded never in. debted. Mr. Monk and Mr. Crompton Hutton appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. H Hill and Mfr. F. Spinks represented the defendants. It appeared that in 1835 a company was established and incorporated for the purpose of supplying the town of Ashton-under-Lyne with water. The town of Ashton. under-Lyne lying near Manchester had participatod in the prosperity of its parent, and Its populatfon and the numn of its manufctories had increased to such an extent that in 1854 the supply of water furnished by the Colnpany was inadequate to satisfy the demands made upon it'.' In thatyear the commissioners of the town of Staleybridke gave notlce of their intention to apply for an Act to enable them to supply the town of htoa-under-Lyne with a sufficient quantity of pure water, and the municipal cororation of Ashton-under-Lyne also gave notice of their lntentlon to apply for an Act to enable them to purchase the existing works of the then company. The company in self defence determined to aipply for an extension Act, which would enable them to draw water from a stream called the Swine Shaw-brook, eud thus prevent any other company being established to their prejudice. They accordingly gave notice of their intention, and instrKcted the plaintiff, rhe eminent waterwork engineer, to take the necessary steps for preparing the plana for the proposed extension, and to have the plans when repared lth egraphed and printed, The pWlntiff accordi ngly had the land surveyed, drew the requisite plans, and sent them to Measrs. Blackllock and Co., lithographic printers at Manchester, for the purpose of their being hthographed and printed. The requfite number of plans having been pregared were deposited at the usual places, Before any Bill' was introduced Into Parliament an arrangement was entered to b which the Stal-eybridge Commissioners undertook not to *pply for their bill, and the municipal corporation parehased the company's works and engaged to discharge all the company's liabilitiUe The plaintiff thereupon sent in his account against the compary, amounting to 47in, to the municipal corporation-the present defendants -who paid him immediately. That acoount, however, did not include the charge for lithographing and printing tbe plans. Messrs. Blacklock and Co.'s charge amounted to 2021., the sum now sought to be recovered. The defendants having refused to pay the demand the present proceedings had been instituted, This case having been proved by evidence, 2ir. H. SIiL said that the case would turn upon the construction to be put upon the words of the Act inoorporating the original company in 1835. He apprehended that the company had no right to enter into any contract vwhich involved an extension of their works. The Act men-. tioned certain placeswithin whichthe company were entitled to supply water, and contained a clause forbidding them to exceed those limits. The bill went on to say that the dividends payable to the shareholders should snot exceed 76 per cent. upon the outlay, and that if there were any surplus income ater paying the shareholders 7i per cent. the oharge for supplying should be reduced proportionally. lUnder these circumstances the inhabitants of the town of Ashton-underLyne would have been injured by any extension of the district to be supplied by the company, as their surplus capital would then go to pay for the new works, instead of roducing the rates payable by the inhabitants of the distrlit mentioned inm e Act. The Bill proposed to be applied for by the compan in 1854 was for the purpose of condderably extending the district to be supplied by the company, and therefore any contract they entered into with regard to that Bill was iUegal, and no action would lie against the defendants for any claim founded upon such a contrat. Any inhabitant of the district might bave applied for an injunction directly he saw the advertisement con, taining the notioe of the application to Parliament for the extension. L.. further objected that as the debti of tha company were directed to be paid out of the borough fund the proper proceeding would have been to apply for a mandamus, instead of bringing an action. Mr. Baron MARTN said it was very hard if the law wva that an Act of Parliament which empowered a company to make certain works and to pay a certain dividend prevented them applying for a new Act for the pYirpose of enabling them to make those -works more complete, and that they could take advantage of it to defeat the claim of the person who had done work for them. He would only put one question to the jury-Was the company justified, under the crcunistances of'the case, in applying to Pazliament for 2the company was justified In so doing Mr nMAxRTL.-Yerdiet for the plaintiff for 2021,' I will give no encouragement'tO such defences.

The case would therefore stand over. THE QEM V. cLOSs, This was a case from the Central Criminal Court The first count stated that oxe John Linnell, of RedhW i: the ont~ of Snzrey, an artist in painting of get ability and weU known, had painted a large and 'aliiable picture, whereon he had painted his name, to,denote that the picture had been painted by hlm, and that Closa, being a dealer in pictures, and intndin to cheat and defraud, did keep a certain copg of the said picture, on whicn copy he unlawfully painted and forged the name I John Linnell,' 'with intent to denote that the copy was an original." The second count charged " that thejirisoner, wtll knowing the picture in his possesion to be a copy, and that the name on it was forged, wilfully, falsely, fraudulently, and deceitfully expoed it for Fale, and' did seUl and dispose of it to one HIenry Fitzpatrick asE a genuine picture, with intent to cheat hnd detaud." Tire third count charged " that the prisoner did, vith intent fo defraud. dispose of the said copy 'witvhAe n uine so forged." The jury found the prisoner guilty on the second and third counts, and acquitted him of The false pretence. Mlr. M'IiNTYRX submitted that no indiotable offence was disclosed in 'the counts upon whioh the prisoner was convicted. The statute did not apply, and by the common law the prisoner was charged with a cheat; the means therefore by which the cheat was effected ought to have been set out. A mere false statement to a private person did not constitute a cheat; there should have been a conspiracy of a public nature or a forgery. The mere writing of the name of another person was not a forgery. The forgery must not be of the Dame only, but of the whole picture. It a man made a gun like Manton's, and put on it Manton's name, that would not be a forgery of the gun. Mr. Justice ERLE asked if the man put on it "John Manton, 163, Piccadilly," would he not be guilty of an offence ? The CiixJIUSTiCs asked if it must not be a cheat which affected the publio. A forgery of something which was intended to defraud an individual was not sufficient. Mr. MIsNyxsE said the jury had negatived the false pretence. There was no case which went the length of saying that the writing of another man's name was a forgery at common blw. The prisoner was not charged with uttering the name, but with uttering the picture. Mr. METcAiaFE supported the conviction. The juil had found that the name was forged, and that the prisoner knowing that, had uttered the picture. A person need not be shown to have been defrauded. The CRIEr JUSTICE said that judgment would be given next Saturday. THE QUEE V. WATSON. It appeaed that the prisoner had advertised for a partner; this was answered by the Rev. Mr. Irvine, and the pri soner then made a false representation to him of the state of the business, in consequenoe of which Mr. Irvine advanced 500L, and then found that all that had been repzesented was false. The prisoner was indicted for obtaining moneq' by false pretences. He was convicted, as the Chairm anof the Sessions had told the jury that if they believed Mr. Irvine they mnst find the prisoner guilty. The quesion was wbether thiS was a false pretence. Mr. Bolwer now appeared for the prisoner. Mr. DASEET said that he and Mr. Stephenson had appeared at the trial for the prosecution, but that he wau not now instructed.

At the request of the nsaster of the Bee the Whitwell came to her asistance, but the two tugs were unable to get the bark into port, and while they were endeavouring to do so the tow zope of the Bee broke. The bark thereupon dropped her anchor, which dragged, and as the salvors alleged she was in peril of being driven upon the south Tocks. The two tugs then endeavoured to take her out to sea, asa signal had been made that she could not enter the dock, but were unable to succeed. They then hailed the Gipey King, which camae to their assistance, and the three tugs took the bark out to sea. The owners of the -bark resisted the demand on the ground that this was an ordinary towing case, the vessel never having been in such peril as the salvors represented. They asserted that the tugs were thrown off directly they had taken the bark out to sea, and that the Bee had claimed and received nothing beyond the ordinary charge for towage, which was, the? contended, all to whlch the two other tugs were entitled. The value of the bark had been estimated by the salvors at about 6,0001., and 161. had been tendered to the two tugs and rejected. * Dr. Amrms and Dr. Twiss argued the case on behalf of the salvors; Dr. JTExNR and Dr. DEAm; for the o,wners.

Mr. Devereux. was called as a witness this morning, ;ad swore that the insolvent in May, 1855, deposited the jewels with hin as security for advances to the extent of 801, and hat nothaving seen or heard of the insolvent for some time, he (Mr. Devereux) about 12 months since sold the jewels for 741. The witness produced several papers, one of which, containing a list of the jewels deposited, was signed W. Iangfeldt." and admitted by the iwsolvent to be in his handwriting. Two letters and an informal transfer of a vemsel to Mr. Devereux, signed in the same name, were also produced, but the insolvent, while admitting that the signatures were very like his own, swore that they had not been written by him, and, npon his attention being called by the learned Commissloner to the faot that the paper purporting to transfer the vessel bore an impress of the very singular seal and coat of arms which he had adopted he stated that he could not account for the circumstance, but he was certain he had not written the documents produced. Mr. Commissioner PMrLLips, after c-omparing the sggnatures to the disputed papers with the admitted signature of the Insolvent, expressed himself as clearly of opinion that the handwriting was the same in each instance. The insolvent pezsisted that the jewels had been deposited with mr. Deverenx for the purpose of sale, and not as security for any debt. He adhered to his statement that they wvere worth 6501., as he had paid 5501. for them to ifess. Wilson and Co., of Colombo. He had them valued by a Mr. Taylor, of Bristol, but he forgot vhat the valuation was. The learned CommissroNER thought It was important to know what the valuation of Mr. Taylor had been, because if that gentleman had placed a low estimate upon them, the Insolvent was not justified in the statement in his schedule that*O they were worth 6501., and were available for his oreditors.

Hlecould not, in the fir8t place, forward the stamps to the woman. beCause AIA was mos-. undeserving, and did not merit sympathy, and, in the econd, he could not allow himself to be the channel of oonveylng contributions to persons whom he had in the exercise of his duty felt bound to commit to prison If the address of " C. H. M." was forwarded to the court the stamp should be returned, bat if he did not hear from the donor within a week he should consider it was left to him to apply the amount to the general poor fund. In the early part of last week Timothy Bagley, a Lame Irishman, presentng a miserable Picture of poverty and wretchedness, was chred at this court with breaking windowrs at St. Luke's workhouse, Chelsea, when, in consequeneo the statemeat he then made, hewas remanded, and M Eagles, relievlng officer of the parish, requested to On the aocused being brought up for re-examination, Mr. ARNOLD, addressing Mr. agles, who was now pre sent, aid that the man in his defence had stated that he had broken the windows because he had no place to go to. He had applied at the workhouse. and had been referred to bim (Mr. agles), and when he went to him, as directed, the door was closed in his face, and his statement unheard. Being refused relief he broke the windows. Mr. Eagles said the prisoner called on him at half-past 6 in tho evening and said he anted a night's lodging, wben he told him that tramps were not admitted at St. Luke's Workhouse, a notioe to that effect being posted up. He did not know what was termed shutting a door in a man's fade. He listened to his statement and gave him an answer, and did not consider he was bound to remain at the door as long as the applicaut pleased to stand there. Mr. ARowLD suggested that, although tramps were not admitted Into the house for a night's lodging, they should be reieved if destitute. Mr. Eagles did not think so, except in cases of sudden and urgent necessity, of which the present was not one. The man was going about from parish to Darish, living upon the public, and had only left Shoreditch Workhouse tht morning. Mr. ARxoLD asked where the poor feolow was to go; he wa san Irishman, a cripple, in England, destitute, and wanting relief, which he surely ought to get somRewhere. Mr. magles said that persons of his description would not. remain long enough in any one parish to be removed, but as soon asthey found that wais about to be doue wrent sonI- Mr. ANxoLD intimated that, although that might be so, and there might be some difficulty in cases of this description, it did not justify a refuni of rehlef. Xr Eales said that the order that no tramp should be adm.ited nad been made by the parochial board, and was' carried out, exoept, as he had described, in sudden and urgentcases, by those under them (the board). MKr. AMoLD did not think they had any right to say they would refuse relief - it the tramp was admitted for the night the law gave tie authoritiee the power to exact from him a certin amount of work, and in the event of refusal to take him before a magistrate for puishment. The first and paramount questlon was, was he entitled to relief? If so, and they did not choose to take him into the workhouse, they were bound to give him the relief his neoessity required out of it. If the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, was right in refudng tramps relief, every other pish would be justfied in doing the same, and what would become of the class of pauper termed tramps who, accordi to the showing, would not be entitled to reiief any- Mr. Eagles said that the polioe had orders not to bring ordinary tramps to either his house or the workhouse. Mr. ALxOLD apprehended that the parish authorities had no power to give any orders to the police. Ar. Eagles complained that his house was nightly beset twith tramps. Mr. ARNOLD did not wonder at it if they were refused relief at the workhouse. It was the duty of somebody to Inquire into and relieve cmes of necessity. The present defendant seemed to have committed the offence with which he stood charged from the absolute necoessity of gettingAniMht's od.ng Be both went to the workhouse and to him (Mr. Eagles). Was he destitute? If so, hewas entitled to relief. Hie the worthy magistrate) begged it to be understood that be did not interfere with the authorities about the pro. pnety of the order in question, but, if they thought fit not to admit tramps, they could not make an order to refuse relief. The defendant had had somo days' imprisonment, and wa now discharged. WORnSEm-sTR=.-Mark Nicholas Powles, a young man of very respectable connexions, was charged with the following offence, founded on anActof William IV., and by which, as stted by Mr. Stuchbhry, of the City Solicitor's offioe, he had rendered himse liable, if convicted, to transportation or two years' imprisonment. On the 18th of last July two journeymen taUors, named Nathan Houtman and Davies Gould, in the servioe of an outfitter named Lynes, in Shoreditch, were charged at this court with forging two orders for the payment of money, with Intent to defraud their employer, and after several examinations were committed for trial at the then next sessions of tho Central Criminal Court. The mistrate consented to accept bail for the prisoners' M ure appearance, and the persons who so presented themselves as beiug jointly and severally liable for Houtman and Gould were a Mr. Abraham Sax, of Church-street, Minorles, glazier, and the present prisoner, who represented himself as ceing Mr. Thomas Powles, of Portland-terraoe, Victoria. pk-road, hosier. At the trial Houtman did notsurrender, fact, had escaped altogether, and, this giving rise to inquirles, their result was the present charge being preferred by the corporation against the prisoner; in support of which Mr. Barzillai Wood, the assstant clerk at tnis court, was called, and formally proved that on the day referred to the two men mentioned were charged with this forgery, and that the prisoner and Mr. Sam tendered themselves as baU in 201. each for each prisoner, were accepted, and, the accused being thereupon liberated, the acknowledgments of recognizanoes were signed by the magistrate, and delivered in usal form at the Old Bailey. Mr. Hollick Tickell, clerk to the Clerk of Arraigns at the Central Criminal Court produced the recognizaiices returned in that prosecution, and Carter, a sergeant of the cit force, deposed to being present at this court when the pisoner and Bax offered themselves and were accepted as ball for Houtman and Gould, and he saw them acknowledge the recognizances in the customary manner. On his attending at the August sessions of the Old Balley Houtman was called, but did not appear; he had never therefore been tried, but had absconded, for he had not been able to find him since. Deeble, a constable of the H division, who had been concerned in thc case of Houtman and Gould, stated that he had known the prisoner for some time previously to hSq becoming bail in this case, and knew that his name was Fowles, bUt had since scertained that bis Christian names were Mark Nicholas, and not Thomas, which was that of his father. He made inquiries about the prisoner, and about two months ago fotud that he had been committed for three months for some offenee to Holloway Prison, where he visited him, and Immediately identified him as the person who had become ball in the name of Thomas Powles forGould and Houtman. He toldhim that only one of the men he was ball for had surrendered, and he replied that it was a very bad job, but that he was only, as he thought, ball for one, Hyward, one of the court offioers, on receiving this information, obtained a warrant, by direction, for the prisoners apprehension, and took him upon it on the term of his confnement at Holloway Prison expiring. Mr. Thomas Powles, the prisoner's father, whose poition was most dutressing, stated that he was formerly in business as a hosier, but had for some time past retired upon hIs pro. erty and resided at Portland-terrace, Victoria Park-road. lae did not attend at this court on the 18th of JTly to become bail for anyperson, norhad he authorized any one to appear for him; he had not the slightest knowledge of either Gould or Houtman, and the prisoner, whose name was Mak NicholsPowlea, not Thomas Powles, never rnentioped an thing to him aboutbecomin bajl for any one. In fact, the arst Intimation ho received about the matter was contaned in a letter forwarded to him by a solicitor in Bow. lany-ippXtg him that Houtman had not appeared t the tr L e of his bail.

Jervis and Colonel R, N. Phillips, in command of the respective battalions, The troops belonging to the respective depots having been formed in review order were inspected by the commanding officers, after which they broke into companies and defiled past In slow and quick time. The appearance of the troops and the execution of the various manauuvres gave much satisfaction to the inspecting field officers. A very handsome silver teapot, bee-ing a suitable inscription, was on Thursday evening 13xst presented by the nonomamissioned officers of the dep6t battalions at Chatham garrison to Sergeant-Major Alexander Reid, who hm for upwards of 20 years filled the situation of chief clerk in the provisional battalion offices at Chatham, and who is now about retiring from the service. The testimonzai was presented to Sergeant-Major Reid by a deputation of upwards of 70 non-commissioned officers belonging to the garrison as a mark of the high respect and esteem in which he has been held duriug his long connexion with the provisional battalion. Recruiting is going on actively at Derby. The 5th Dragoon Guards, 37th Foot, 63d Fcot, Grenadier Guards, Royal Mszues, and the Rifle Brl5-P ie have each received additions, about 2C03 men having been lately enlisted in those regiments.

The - Agiers, 91, sister ship, is being expedited for the pendant at. Portsmouth as much as posslble; there will be no diffic-rlty in manning a fleet if commissioned, the guardsbips being full of continuous and general sexr ice men, to the eitent at Portsmouth alone of about 2,000 (collectively), above their own complements, and more are being added daUy by the ships paying olF. The Jason screw steamship arrived at Cowes yesterday morning from New York, en route to Bremen ; she landed 'her maUs and proceeded. The Echo steamtug embarked at Portsmsuth Dockyard, on Saturday night, detachments of the Gth, 45th, and 50th Regiments, and proceeded with them to Cowes, where they landed and marched to the Dep6t Battalion quarters at Parkhurst; they were followed yesterday by other dotachments of the 6th and 50th, wbich were conveyed across the Solent by the Comet stsamtug. The Briliant, 20, Captain J. A. I'aynter, which was paid off at Chatham on Saturday, has been in commission about 18 tnonths, having been fitted out in May, 1856, to join the squadron of Rear-Admiral A. Fanshawe, C.B., then Commnander-in-Chief on the North American and West India station. On sailing from England the Brilliant proceeded to Halifam, from whence she was ordered to the West Indies for the purpese of craising among the Windward Islands to assist in the suppression of the slave trade. Dnring hercruise, which extended over about 20,000 miles, the Brilliant visited Barbadoes, St. Thomas's, Grenada, Trinidad, and the other West India Islands. While cruising off Dominica the Brilliant succeeded in capturing a slaver called the smeralda, supposed to have been a Brazilian slave ship; at the timeof the capturethe schooner had upwards of 60 slaves on board, the whole of whom were liberated in Jamaica. Duringthe time the Brilliant was in the West Indies the crew were exceedingly unhealthy, and the mortality on board very great, 34 men and the chaplain having died at Grenada from yellow fever, which seized nearly 100 of the crew. Two able seamen, named Henry Lewis and William Morgan, were accidenraly killed on board by falling from aloft. The Brilliant having been ordered to return to England sailed from the West Indies early in September last for the purpose of being put out of commission. By the new arrangement ordered by the Admiralty the whole of the crew were on Saturday last paid off by Mr. E. J. Giles, the paymaster, in the short space of 1 hour and 40 minutes. On being paid off William Street, quartermnaster, was recommended to the Admiralty for the siver medal and gratuity for long service aud meritorious conduct.

Andrews, paymaster of the second class. A new marine engine boiler, pateanted by Rear-Admiral of the Blue John Jervis Tacker and Mr. Georgeo Blland, chief superintendent engineer at Sheerness Yard, has been under trial for some weeks past, the trial being uaperjated by mir, Joha H. -Lwgley, hpetQg of machinery, on board the Edinburgh, for the stsam squad. ron of reseUe The advantages the patent boiler possesses are, doing away entirely witih the tubes now used in tubular boilers, generating a larger supply of steam with a less quantity of fuel, and not being subject to the derange. ments in heavy weather at sea like the present boilers. It is reported that the Admiralty have greuted permission for one of the large class gunboats at Sheerness to bs fitted with a boiler of the same description as the one now under trial, and she is to proceed to sea for a series of days in company with a gunboat of similar class, having the pre sent tubular boilers fitted, in order fairly to test the effect in a heavy sea way. The following appointments have been made at the Admiralty:- Ileutenant Edward Stubbs to the Alert; Lieutenant Rawksworth Fawks to the Alacrity ; Lieutenant W. F.

REWARDS POR GALLANT CONDUCTAT SEA. One of those Interesting ocourrences which have latterly b^sn of gratify:ng frequence at the Liverpool Sailors' Home -namely, the presentation, through the Local Marine Board, of rewards to merchant captains or seamen for gallant conduct at sea-took place on Saturday afternoon. 'The members of the Local Marine Board who were present were Ur. S. R. Greaves, in the chair, and Messrs. Tomlin. son, George Kendal, John Lockett, and James Smith. The recipients of the distinction were Lewis Whiteway, master, and J. C. Beer, mate, of the bark Dennis Brundit, of Liverpool, who were to be presented with large silver medals, forwarded for that purpose by the Board of Trade, for their gallantry and intrepidity in rescuing the captain and part of the crew of the ship Walter Mancaster, of Whitehayen, wrecked on the rocks near the port of Chanaral on the 27th June. Captain Whiteway was not in attendance, having to meet his owner in the country; but the mate, Beer, was present and received the medals. Mr. Greaves, in introduoing the proceedings of the day, said there were two duties imposed on the local marine,-one the very unpleasant one of inflicting l)unibhment for what was happily an exceptional offence and a decreasing one, that of misconduct on the part of masters of the British mercantile marine; and the other the always gratifying and pleasing duty of rewarding meritorious actions, wbioh he was delighted to say were on the increase. He then referred to the evil of drunkenness connected with the mercantile marine,-a habit which rendered nugatory the most valuable qualifications of a master, as alike affecting the safety of his ship and cargo and the interests of his owners, who at the least were subject to severe contingencies, but whose risks were great indeed when obliged to intrust their pro. perty into the hands of men who in foreign seas, by the terrible vice of drunkenness, lost their own self-control, and were consequently in an unfit state to carry a vessel eafely to Its destination. While it was their duty to investigate such cases of drunkenness it was gratifying to be able to re. port that during the past six months they had had no occasion to enter upon an inquiry so painful, while in the previous sin months they investlgate no less than 10 such cases. On the other hand, the pleasing duty of rewarding merchant cap. tains had kept pace with the decrease of that which was censurable, for during the pastbalf-yearsix testimonialshad been awarded from various Governments, against two in the previous Six months.* He (Mr. Greaves) did not like to make invidious distinctions when the Board of T'rade and others high in authority awarded medals and other marls of an honourable nature, but justice com. ccUed him to state that in the case before them, Captain Whiteway and his mate, Beer, together with the second mate, whose life paid the forfeit of his humanity, and the whole crew, had displayed an amorut of gaUant bravery which he had never seen surpassed. The ship Walter San. caster, of Whitehaven, left the port of Chanaral on the 27th of June last, and she was soon after discovered on the rocks exposed to a tremendous roll of the sea, of which only those who had witnessed the phenomena of the Pacific ocean could form any idea, and which rendered a wrecked| vessel very difficult to approach. In this position the Walter hlancaster was porcelved by the bark Dennis Brundit, from I Lfverpool, and a Chilian bark, the HelMne, commanded by a Frenchman, whose conduct on the occasion was worthy of all praise. These twro vessels immediately lowered their boats and endeavoured to reach the wreck, but they could not get near her on aecount of the terrible rolling of the sea. From the wreck a boat was launched containing the captain's wife and 10 other persons; but It was speedily swamped, and the captain's wife and sin of the men were drowned, although the mate, Beer, pushed on with his boat at imminent danger. Se succeeded, however, in rescuing four men, and placing them on board his own vessel in safety. The boats were then compelled to return to their ships, the captain of the wrecked vessel, who, with a portion of his crew, remained by her, being promised that they would remain by her all night, and renew their humane efforts in the morning. When morning dawned the mate (Beer), although finding that the only means of saving the lives of those on the wreck was by risking hlmself and his men, pushed boldly through the surf, when his boat capsized and the second mate anid three men were instantaneously enguled. The mate himself succeeded in passing two oars under his arms, and he was kept afloat two hours and a-half, during which time it was beMeved on board the bark that he also was lost. When picked up he was in a state of insensibility, from which he was recovered only by the skill displayed by a foreign surgeon who was on board the Dennis Brundit as a passenger. "To such a man as this brave mate," observed Mr. Greaves, "who had not shrunk from the gravest dan. gems, they could not do less, while presenting him with a silver medal, than also accord to him their heartfelt thanks." But to return to the wreck, from the leeward side of which the captain and the three remaining seamen had in the meantime launched a rudely constructed raft, and having got on to it aLlowed it to drift from their doomed shi. hey were perceived by Captain Whiteway, who gallantl; put his vessel forward and succeeded in meeting the raft and saving those four lives. It was for these brave deeds that the Board of Trade had been pleased to grant their silver medals to the captain and his mate, accompanied by an expression of their Lordships' sense of their gallant services. IIn the irst six months the presentationa were-a gold Chrone. meter froma the President of the UYnited States to Captain Joseph
RECRUrIINO IN T}IE LivEBrooL DIsTRIcT.-Recruiting has been going on in this district up to the last Indisn news with unprecedented vigour; but during the last few days the zeal has somewhat abated. It is a fact worthy of note that at the time when the gloomiest news was received from the East, and when the hardships of the soldier were fresn in every mind. the applications for en. listment were at their height. This anmply illustrates the genuine martial ardour diffused among the people. The recruiting officers also say that at no formuer period was fhe proportion of weU educated and likely young men so nume. rous. Their proportion is now about 80 per cent, as con. trasted with the uneducated. This may be accounted for by the depressed state of trade, by the pleadings of the press for Justice to the private soldier, and by the effebts of improved and certain systems of education. From the 26th of August to the 15th of November X,325 recruits passed the Liverpool district recruiting-office, being an average of 277 men a- week.-Liverpool Jowu2-a. DAltrIG ESCAPE.-On Saturday morning a convict, named Thomas King, alias Kelly, made his escapa at Obatham in a very daring manner. For several weets past large gangs of convicts from the new convict prison recently erected at Chatham have been em. ployed in repairing the Government roads at Chatham closely guarded by warders, all of whom are provlded with a loaded rifle. On Saturday morning, about 9 o'clock the convicts were employed stone-breaking in the military road, when King asked leave of his warder, a man narscd Jackson, to be allowed to retire for a few minutes. Permission having been, as usual, granted, he was followed by Jackson, when the convict made a sudden dart through the railings near the soldiers' burialground at the foot of the lines, and, although fired at and followed for some distance by Jackson, succeeded in effecting his escane. Shonk, a olice- constable, and several of the ether warilere, followed Kng, but, although it was broad daylight and hundreds of persons about, he succeeded in gaining the woods at the out. sldrts of the town, where al traces of im were lost and, notwithstandinig numbers of mien were aliday Saturda'y and yesterday engaged in searching for him, his retreAt could not bediscovered.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIM.&S. Sir,-In a letter from my son, who was present at and took part in the asaault of Delhi, I find the ollowing statement; it has not been mentioned, as far as I can observe, in any other letters, and it may perhaps contain an explanation of the charge in some of the French papers on which you commented yesterday. " Delhi, Sept. 26. "I am sorry to say that we lost a good many raen at first, owing to the large quantity of liquor which the Sepoys had left purposely in the houses, and with which many of the Eutropeans became intoxicated; and were out off by the zebels conoealed in the houses." What can be more probable than that in one or two instances this diabolical device was discovered, or ineffectually attempted, but promptly avenged ?

Sir,-Some of your recent articles on matters connected with the mutiny in India, and the principles on which our future government of that country should be conducted, are so true and so foroibly expressed that it is presumption to endeavour to add to their force; still, as the opinions of one who has passed his life in India, with better opportunities of knowing what takes place behind the scenes than many men, may possibly be of some little account, I hope I may be permitted to support the sentiments you have so ably enunciated. The leading defects in our Indian Government are the selection from home of incompetent men for the chief sitions, utting by those of tried and proved capacity in ,anthe systematic ignoring of a fact you at least have had the sense and manliness to proclaim-viz., that the white man and the dark man are not equal. The incompetency of the men selected for chief command in India is of two kinds-the first and rarest case being that of able men, their abilities neutrallied by inevitable ignorance or rendered mischievous by self-will; the second, or more ordinary case, that of men known to be unfit, but who require to be provided for. Ans I required to name instances ? It foJlows from the nature of such appointments that the exercise of powers confided to suoh hands is viewed with doubt and suspicion, and rules and restrictions are framed and zealously enforced, hampering and destroying the usefulness of any reasly fit and good man who finds himself inchief command, repressingall energyand fostering medioority. So we see worn out and incompetent men occupying positions of trust, both because of the want of will in some case8, and of powerin all to remove them, until some over act of mischievous unfitness (Meerut, Dina. pore, and Cabul are only types) has proved to all -what has logben known at head-quarters. The second great error is the mi8chievous delusion that the white and the'dark man are euaL Whether they are so in the sight of God, or why He has chosen to make them of different natures, are matters which He alone in His inscrutable wisdom can solve. Sufficient for us is the fact that they are no more equal, and no more to be governed by the same rules, tbau the man and the ape. We have, under the guidance of amiable enthusiasts and frothy declaimers, for loDg thought- it right to ignore the fact, and now that we have ruined the West Indies and nearly lost the East (to say nothing of the Cape) it ins8urely time to pause and to consider whether it is nlotpossible that those who know most of the dark portlon of humanity may not, after all, be right when they decline a!cknowledging them altogether an men and brethren. It would take a volume thoroughly to discuss these points, but it would not be difficult to show that the want of sound disciplie in the Bengal army, which, whatever may have been the exciting causes, alone permittod those causes to take effect, is immediately and directly traceable to those radical defects in our Indian government, and that until they are amended no other reforms will avail. I have only one word to add. The officers of the Bengal army have shown to the whole world that, wbatever may have been the defects of the system in which they have been trained, they. are not to blame; a nobler body of men never wore the British uniform, but they have been for years insulted and overborne, authority and power to reward and punish taken from them, while their men have been pam. pered and taught to set them aside; they have been placed beyond the control of the superior minds, and have acted after their brnte natnrps_.

TO THE EDITOR OF' TÂ£H TIMES. Sir,-On the 4th inst. you inserted a letter signed "Justitia," and headed " Smoking in Rallway Carriages," which contained the following passage:- " On Friday last two ladies and two gentlemen took their places from York to Leeds in a first-class carriage (No. 5) by the 3.30 train. In the next compartment of the same carriage were five gentlemen, two of whom were directors of the North-Eastern Rafilway. Their names can be given. The moment the train had left York cigars were lighted, and the parties continued to smoke, in spite of a remonstranoe addressed to them at Milford Junction through one of the porters, till the end of the journey." I am fully aware that in stirring times like the present petty grievances mnust give precedence to matters of great pub) o interest, but, having waited a fortnight in vain, I now feel that I have a just right to ask for the insertion of this letter, giving the most unqualified contradiction to the above charge. I not only assert that no directors of the North-Eastern Raiway smoked on the occasion alluded to, but that no one smoked i their presence; and, further, that no remonstrance of ary kind w as addressed to them on the subject; and I call upon "Justitia" to give the names of the offending parties, or, failing this, to give his own, that the peublic may form their OWn estimate of the weight to be attached to any statement of his In futsure. I am. Sir. vonr most obeclient. sa,-va,,e -T- R. TF MTPRO%N Chairman of the North-Eastern Railway Company. Norffh-Eastern Railway, Seoretary's-office, York, Nov. 20.
THE SLKASESE EBAssY.--The crown brought by the Siamese Embassy is a high conical cap of gold filigree, with bands of gold and enamel running round it, and ornamented with a few jewels. In general appearance It is not unlike the triple crown of the Pope; and, as it is intended to be worn, it is made exceedingly light. The "umbrellas" are apt to suggest very undignified notions to our minds, as presents from one Sovereign to another; but they are very different affairs from our umbrellas. Our readers must imagine a golden stick, an,d on it a fiat shade, or umbrella, of gold tissue; above it, on the same stick, and at some distance, a smaller shade, and then again a smaUer, until they taper to a point; they are aU of gold tissue, and are standards emblematical of Regal di ity, beinglas such planted before the throne at Siam. lPhe star is more like a very small, but boldly projecting, shield, studded with beautiful jewels. A conchshell of great beauty ornamented with precious stones is among the presents. The ring is a massive hoop, set with a variety of stones aU of the same size; among them is a very fine cat's eye.-Courit Journal. ScoTuH BANKs.-Since lit week a very iIUportant change has taken place in the podtion of the Scotch banks which had suspended their business. A vigorous attempt is being made by the proprietary and also by the depositors of the Western Bank and the City of Glasgow Bank to enable them to resume their business. If such an arrangement could be made, it would undoubtedly prove extremuely beneficial to all concerned, and would prevent sacrifices to a large amount. If it were only with a view of liquidating the present extensive engagements of those bauks, or of contraeting their liabilities within moderate dimensions, in the expectation of gradually acquiring again the confidence of the public, so as to render it possible to raise new banks, either out of or in continuation of the present ones, the success of the efforts which are now being made would be a great gain to the public. Everyone knows what differance it makes in the faclity of settling accounts and curtailing the transactions of a business which is still going on, and which has every prospect of continuing, compared with one whieh has been brought to a close. In the resumption of business by these banks, they would, however, be deprived of their cireulation; and this event would not therefore, even if it took place, supply the void which has been created in the Scotch circulation. The 12th section of the Act of 1844 provides :-" That if any banker in any part of the United Kingdom who, after the passing of this Act, shall be entltled to issue banknotes shal become bankrupt, or shall cease to carry on the busineus of a banker, or shall discontinue the issue of banknotes, either by agreement with the Governor and Company of the Bank of England or otherwise, it shall not be lawful for such bankrer at any time thereafter to issue anY such notes." Now, we think, in the face of this provision of the Act, it is impossible to contend, as we see some do, thal~ these banks have not forfeited their right of issin noe.Btee though this may be so, it would be a disadvantage to them far less thau at first sight may aDpear. 'What was their business? Together they issued -notes to the extent of 807,1.11., but against which they held coin to the amount of 443,2321., leaving the uncovered circuLation of the two banks, upon which alone they obtained any profit, only 1 363,8701. On the other hand, the aggregate amoant of the deposits in the two banks exceeded 9,000,0001., upon whieh they derived a large profit, by the difference of the interest which they allowed and that which they received. The trath is that there is a great popular error as to thi sources from which the banks in Scotland derive their proft; and nothing has been more exaggeratsd thaa the advantages which they derive from their paper circulation. The whole amount of the circulation of Scotland uncovered by gold very little exceeds 3,000,0001., and, even allowing that a profit is derived of 4 per cent. upon it, the net income to all the banks from that source would be but 120,0001. a-year. The deposits of all the banks are understood to exceed 45,000,0001., and, supposing that they derive a profit of only 1 per cent. between the interest alowed and the rate at which it is employed, the profit derived from this source would exceed 4U0,0001. after allowing a fair margin for an unemployed reserve. We trust, therefore, ehat those who are attempting to resuscitate the banks in question wiU not be deterred by the fact that they may find that under the law they have lost their right of issuing notes. There would even be some advantage to those banks, until they had, by a period of prc.dent management, again secured the confidence of the public, to refrain from the issue of notes, even if they had the ri4ht, and to confine themselves to the business of deposit and exchange only.- 2Economist.

TIA BANK BETURNS, (From the Economi,l.) A reference to the Bank returns will show tbat, under the letter issued by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Bank of England, the issues upon securities kad on Wednesday night exceeded the statutory limit of 14,475,0001. by 2,000,OO01. With this issue the Bank had a reserve in the head establishmen't and all the branches of 1,552,6861., while the deposits, public and private, had risen to 19,440,0461., the private deposits alone being 13,959,1651., showing an increase of 1,023,8211. upon those of last week. la the bullion there Is a decrease of 686,4121. of Government securitiesa decrease of 3,037,0001., and of pnvate securitiesanincreaseof 4184,0001. These are changes probably more remarkable than any which ever ! before occurred in any one week. To pass over the addition of 2 000.0001. of Government securities to the issue Department as arising from a well known cause, the most remarkable features are the large increase in the advances to the public, the decrease in the Governmuent securities, and the ncrease of private deposits. At first sight it appears aingular tVnt at such a time there ehould be an increase of deposiss. Bat it will be observed that this increase has been about 1,000,0001. in the week, making in thelastfortnight about 2,000,0001, Nobetter proof could be furnished of the extreme prudence and caution upon which bankers and others have been acting in strengthening their reserves. On the other hand,the publichave certainly not been inconvenienced by these private hoards; for wbat the bankers have deposited the Bank of England has freely advanced. In the sLugle week the discounts and loans of the Bank upon private securites have been increased by 4,184,0001, at a rate of 10 per cent. as a minimum. The Bank has also, in order to aid the demands for trade, largely disposed of Government securities. It will be observed that the decrease under this bead is close upon 3,000,0001. -of whiz h, however, 2,000,0001. has been transferred to the Issue Department, leaving 1,000,0001. as having been sold. There has rarely been a week in which so much stock bas been disposed of, and yet the price has scarcely been afrected-which shova to how great an extent the public are investing in the funds. It will be observed that the notes in the hands of the public have increased by 1,223,0001. caused In the main by their being taken Into the country, in order to strengthent the reserves of country banks. But the changes in the Bank returns durirg the last seven weeks have been so remarkable that they are well worth a careful comparison and consideration.

It is true that about 2.000,0001. of that decrease has taken place since the foreign drain was in a great degree stopped, and has been caused chiefly by a demand in Scotland and Ireland. The Government deposits, which on the 10th of October stood at 10,560,0001., have been reduced to 6,407,0001., being a difference of more than 4,000,0001., of which onehalf has been transferred to the Issue Department in exchange for notes, and one-half has been sold in the market. It is remarkable that, in the face of such heavy sales, the funds have maintained their price so well, and this is more remarkable when it is known that, in addition to these large Government sales, bond fide transfers to the public as investments have been made in the same time to an amount exceeding five millions; so that during that period the purchases by the public have exceeded seven millions. The advances by the Bank upon private securities, in. cluding discounts, have Increased from 22,898,0001. to 30,299,000M, or by 7,401,0001. The amount of these advances on the 10th of October was larger than they wereupon an y former occasion, and yet in the present week they have increased by the large amount we have named. It is, however, proper here to remark that a large share of the business has been thrown upoi the Bank during the last fortnight, in which the great portion of the increase has taken place, owig to the comparative suspension from business which has taken place in other quarters. The private deposits, including those of bankers, amounted on the 10th of October to 9,667,0001. ; on Wednesday last they were 13,959,0001_, showing an increase of no less than 4,292,000/,, a great portion of w hich consists of the deposits of bankers, who, being desirous of strengthening their reserves, have materially curtailed their transactions, and have been content to keep large balances in the Bank unemployed. What they probably could not well do with safety the Bank of England could. If it were not for the facts, that a large portion of the drain of bullion which has taken place during the last fortnight has been for internal, and not for foreign demand ; that the exchanges are now all favourable to this country, and such as are likely to lead to an early return of much of the bullion that has already been shipped; that in Scotland and Ireland confidence is so far restored that a considerable portion of the gold sent thither may soon be restored to the Bank, a considerable amount having already arrived from Scotland since these accounts were made up; and, lastly, that considerable arrivals from Australia are now taking place, and that others may soon be looked for,-we should be disposed to view the condition of the Bank, with its reduced amount of bullion, as being far from satisfactory, and as indicating the necessity for some further rise in the rate of discount. As it is, with these favourable prospects it iS to be hoped that the present insufficient reserve will, without ang new restriction, be increased considerably by a return of gold and the subsidence of that state of anxiety and distrust wvhich have added not a little to the pressure caused by the events of the last month. * r __ .~~~~~~~~
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,- I think it is Lord Bacon who says of honours and promotions that they are " the cheap defence of nations ;" and this is illustra ted as a truth by what " poor Salkeld's" brother officer writes of him-that "the red riband has been better than any medicine;" adding, " I am sure I would have given my left arm for it." Now, this red riband, with its "cheap" little Victoria cross, was conferred by General Wilson, with a soldier's heart, the moment it was earned, and hence its " medicinal" value. Truly, it may help to cure the gallant sufferer. In any case, its value is enhanced to himself and to his friends by the promptness of the award. " Bis dat qui ceto dat" would be a good heading for the Gazette. The country wiU echo your opinions on the rewards of its faithful Indian servants. We sre indeed "doing' Delhi, Lucknow, and Cawnpore " cheap" if Tuesday's Gazette be not only va small instalment; but cheaper than all at present is the relief of Arrah. I thought I must have overlooked some late Gazeac, recognizing the services of the officerwho withless than 200menretrieved thedisasterof Dinapore, defeated above 3,000 mutineers underKoorSingh, delivered our beleaguered handful at Arrah, followed the rebel chief to his stronghold, dispersed his force again, burnt his palace, and took his guns; and on a third occasion-all within a few days-entirely destroyed another body of rebels against whom he was sent. We are asking at the clubsand perhaps some of your readers can explain it-why is not Major Vincent Eyre promoted or honoured, after receiving " the thanks of the Governor-General in Council," and I fancy, also, the strong recommendation of the Commanderin-Chief in India ? This offioer has since taken his part in the relief of Lucknow, and is, of course, sharing the uncertainties of the desperate service which was to follow. Should he fall, it wi be surely doing it too cheap to tell his ghost in the Gazette what he would have been made had he remained a little longer in the lesb. lsae that Major Eyre and General Nicholson were fellow-prisoners in Affghanistan, and Nicholson was then only an ensign. Having earlier sub. sequent opportunities, the latter fought his way earlier to well-merited rank and honour. HIas not his comrade now at last rnade a tolerably good use of his ftst chance ? And should not the merits of each affair be dealt with as they arise, so as both to do justice to the individual and to encourage the mass? I have seen many letters from India warm in admiration of the relief of Arrah, and the press of this country has not been slow to say, " WeU done!' Let us hope that official routine will overtake Major Vincent Eyre within a moderate time. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, SAGITTA. I

THE WRSTEBIV BANK. TO TEI; EDITOR OF THE TIBES. Sir,-I am a plain man-I fear a very simple one. Be lieving in the annual reports and statements of the diremsors of this bank, and the dividends of 9 per oent. per annuum, professedly paid out of profits, I invested by far the greater po; on of a small forttue realized in the course of business for more than 30 years in the purchase of shares in the bank at upwards of 60 per cent. premitnm-that is, I paid above 801. per share, the par price being 501. I now find that my shares are worth nil, that all my money invested in this bank is gone-nay, that the remnant of my little fortune is in jeopardy and liable to be seized or sequestered to make good the deficiencies of the bank. This bank there are reasons for thinking must have been rotten for years past. If this has been the case, what I want to know is, if the innocent shareholders who, like myself, wero inveigled by the delusive reports and balance-sheets of tho directors, have not a claim for relief against the directors ? or should not the whole liability fallon the directors, if they are able to stand it? It is something like high treason to speak truth or comnmon sene regarding this bank. The cry is that the shareholders are worth far more than the liabilities; that they areentitled to the utmost confidence of the public ; that the transfer books are closed; that there can be no escape by any shareholder of his fuU share of liability by sellUng his shares; and that there is not the slightest doubt the bank will resume business in a very short time. On the faith of these statements the depositors of the bank,at public meetings, have resolved toaltow their depositg to remain for the period of two years at 5 per cent. interest, the sum of 101, being payable Immediately on each deposit to all who may require the same. The idea is held out that the depositors are safe because the transfer books are closed. The depositors have conI sented to two years' delay after the 1st of January, 1858; in that time howr many individual shareholders wiU hAve sold ir mortgaged their private estates, and emigrated, or taken " leg bail," and so escaped liability to the depositors ? Are there not some putting their houses in order even already ? Have the large shareholders and directors of this bank,whose united wealth is adequate, we are told, to all the liabilities of the bank-above 8,000,0001. I-put themselves under legal prohibition against making away with, or securing to themselves those princely estates which many of them have bought with the depositors' money ? Have letters of inhibition been applied for and obtained against all the shareholders of this bank, preventing them from saving themselves by the sale of their estates, or turning their property as fast as they can into cash and running away from the rack and ruln which threaten them? In the course of these two years how many shareholders will be bankrupt ? now many wiU go into the GazeUc just to save themselves from their lability for these deposits? I would direct attention to the Act 21st Victoria, cap. 54, passed last session,-Are the directors of the Western Bank not amenable to this law? As to resuming business, how can the Western ever re. some business in the face of the 7th and 8th of Victoria cap. 32, sect. 12, to which I direct attention ? It has " ceased to carry on business," nad " discontinued the issue of notes," and, according to this Act, "it shall not be lawful for slch bauk at any time thereafter to issue such notes." This Act applies not to banks in England only, but to all banks "in the united kingdom." There has been no specific statement furnished yet regarding the affairs of this bank. Perhaps there has not been tuwe to prepare a statement of the kind. But before we can judge at all it is necessary we should understand,1, the amount ofdeposits under 501.; 2, ditto above 501.; 3, notes outstanding; 4, bills rediscounted; 5, balances on open account due by bank; 6, salaries, &c.; and, on credit side or assets-1, bills discounted (good), -; 2, ditto (bad or doubtful), valued at Â£-; 3, "marginal accounts," or accounts overdrawn, Â£-; 4, Government securities; 5, other securities, both real and personal; 6, bank buildings, branches, farniture, &c. And we should know who are the parties who have got advances on " marginal aecounts"-a new term in the cabalistic art of money and banking aX it is I am, Sir, your verv obedient gCA-i SCRUTATOR.

THE EXETEB-HALL SBRVICES. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-The effect of the prohibition imposed on the Exeterhail services by Mr. Edouard is, as appears from The Tirnc of Thursday, that they will now be conducted by Dissenting ministers; and may God speed therm in EO far as they shall preach the Gospel of Christ. But such is the effect of the prohibition by Mr. Edouard. Now, what does Mr. Edouard say to this? The reason assigned by that gentleman for the prohibition was, that by means of those services lasb spring certain churches in the neighbourhood suffered loss and were dsma ed and that like causes wquld again be productlve ofTie effects. Now, does Mr. Edouard's apprehensior, relAte to those particular churches only, or to the church of England generally, and as such^ In plain words, does Mr. Edouard mean that the Exeter-haU services, as conducted last spring, damaged, by their attraction, the congregations of those partlcular churches, or damaged, by the fact of their being held in an unconsecratd building the church of England generally, and aa such? If the former is his meaning, then the zaatter of moment viith Mr. Edouard is, not how can the greatest number of ignorant and perishing souls be Instructed and saved, but how can the greatest number of individuals be brought to his own and a fAw other particular churches. To reconcile this with the object of that Gospel of which he himself professes to be a preacher I leave to Mr. Edouard himself. But if the latter be his meaning, then what does he think of the wisdom of the course ho has adopted? Exeter-hall will now be filed evening after evening, not merely with thousands of Dissenters, but with thousands also of members of the church of England, listening to the ablest of Dissenting ministers, and receiving at their lips that spiritual food and instruction which, but for his prohibi. tion, would have been administered in the same place by 'celergymen of his owvn church instead I Who, Sir, nowr Is the damager of the church; who is casting her ministrations into thebackground, and giving needless prominence to those of Dissentors? And yet such are the men who bosut of their Churoimanship} and are ready to denounee others as enemaies of the estab,lishment.dytdeonethrasn- One word more. It is triumphantly asked, "Why are not these services held in St. Paul's Cathedral or Westrinster Abbey, instead of Exeter-hall or other unconseorated places 1" It might be sufficient to reply that, were Itso, the probabiaty Is that half the people who are induced to attend the hall would not be disposed to attend either the cxthedral or the abbey; or that, if they did, half would not, from the structure of the buildings, catch a word of the preacher's address. But a better reply is this,-Will. the authorities in the cathedral or abbey alow such services as were conducted and sanction such preachers as were heard at Exeter-hall last spring ? If so, let them forthwith invite those preachers, er others of similar sentiments, to take their places during the coming Sunday evenings in those consecrated buildings. But, if not, then, Sir, there needs no other reason for Exeter-hall being employed, or any other hall, where the Word of God, which is the power of God unto salvation, may, without let or hindrance, "have free course and be glorified."

THE AUSTBA'IuA OVERLAXD MAAm.-An unhappy fatality seems to await the Australian overland mail service. The unfortunate disaster which has occurred to the Emeu steamer, with the homeward mails of September from the different colonies, again throws the postal intercourse into Irregularity, forit appears that she is rendered quite unfit to return with the October ouatward mall, and which must necessarily wait for the arrival of the Simlna, so that the October "nd November bags will leave Suez together, while it is equally possible that the missing September letters, per Emen, will come forward with the October advices, per Simla which will be due at Suez November 23 ; and It is possible that telegraphic intelligence may be received next Thursday vid Malta and Caglarl. It will be remembered that the Emea went out from England to take tho place of the Oneida, and, strange to say, she likewise, on her first postal trip between the Australian colonies and Suez has been dlabled, and is unseaworthy for the present senr ice; so that until she is enabled to resume her position, or another steamer is despatohed from 13ngland to take her place, the service to and fro must be subjeot to disarrangement. We understand that one box leÂ£t on beard the Emen, supposed to contain newspapers, proves to be letters. The whole of the mails, with this fortunate exception, are with the Arab packet boat, and among which are no less than 11,000 registered letters, the delay In the receipt of which, in these times of monetary pressure, may be ofmore than usual, if not of serious, consequence.- Mining Jour-na4 of Nov. 2L1.
EXETZR HALL. Last night the firat of a series of Sanday evening rellg[ou services was held in Exeter.hall, under the auspices of i influential body of Dismenters in the metropoli4, havlng proi disely the s ame object in view as those instituted in th summer of the present year, with the sanction and approig of both the Archbishop of Catterbury and theBishop of Loix. don, but to the resumption of which, as is well known, * stop was recently put by the incumbent of St Mchael'4 Burleigh.street, Strand, inwho eparish this"unoonsenter building" happens to be located, acting on a strict legal right with1which the law nvests himn. The energetic and benq volent movement,therefore,whichemanated fromtheChurc; of England with the view of bringing under the influenoe ot the Gospel a large class of the inhabitants of this city wh* habitually absent themselves from all the ordinary places of worship-which reeived the direct countenance of some of her most distinguished laymen, and the asdstanos ot some of her most eminent divine, and which, so fAr u 1f went, was attended with con derable suaooerowis notf it seems, destine t areed rthongh it be earried on hi othmer hands thanethose bluh which itoginatedy The ReveWr Brook, minister of the Baptlstcapel anoBlomthingcoudbho preacber selected to ofhicatthendthe occasion. The doorplwer opened a' 6 o'clock, but long before thathoura crowrd of wvells dressed people had assembled inl front of the hail, and whorn aduniealon was obtalned thehbuilding was speedily fillod in every pert. Dense though the crowrd was, nothing could be more creditable than the order and decorum with which the people ascended the stairs leading to the hall and took their seats. The admission was wholly free; there were no reservedseatg, not even on the platform; no money coUection. Tkeservlcs as on the formeroccasion, were announced to be for the benefib of the working classes, andpersons accuatomedtoattendplaoes of worship were requested not to absent themselves fromt them, lest they might occupy room intendedfor thoso whons it was specially designed to instruct and edify. This hint, we apprehend, was not acted upon to the fall, any mor* than in summer, when the Church of England servioee were held in the same place, and when peers of the realm Cabinet Ministers, and distinguished mesmbersof Par1iamnen were to be seen among the general audience. Mr. Brook took his sea' on the platform shortly after 6w aocompanied by Mfr. A. Kinnaird, ALP., Mr. S. Mlorley and several other gentlemen, and the service commenced a thebalfhonr. Itis anoteeworthy circunmstance, and creditable to the minister and all concerned in the arrangementsas indicating a desire to divest these ministra.. tions as much as possible of everything like sectarian feeling and to make them a substautial contirnuation or those Wlvhch had gone before-that the hymns and ritual used in the servlce last night were precisely those adopted at the Sunday evening services of the Church of England held there in the present year. It is, perhaps, the first occasion on which a Nonconformist minister- except amoDg the Wesleyans, where the practioe is not uncommon-has used the Litasny of the Church oC England and several of the prayers contained in its ritual in conducting a religious serv:ce. The circumstance is significant of an increasing spirit of religioua toleration and a desire for a hearty co-operation,r if not for union, among some at least of the various sections of the Protestant churob. In one part ot the Litany, indeed, Mr. Brock introduced words to which. no one could p)ssibly object, not even, we imagine, the most rigid Churchman. In the intercesdon, begin. ning-" That it may please Thee to illumiuat( all bishops, priests, and deacons, with true knowledge and understanding of Thy Word; and that both by their preaching and living they may set it forth and show it An. cordingly"-be added, after the word " deacons," "pastors, ministers, and missionaries of the GospeL" At another period of the service he put up an extempore prayer anal read elected portions of Scripture in much the same way as is customary in Dissenting cbspels. He afterwards preached a sermon from the 15th chapter of the First Epistlet to the Corinthians, the 3d and 4th ver&es-" For I delivered unto you, first of all, that which I also received; how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, an( that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, accoilung to the Scriptures." The discourse for earnestness, novelty, aud felicity of ilustration, and vigour of deliver, was far above the ordinary class of sermons, and was listened to throagb out with the most marked attention. Touching the resumptior of the Sunday evening servioest by clergymenof theChurchof Englaud,it issmid, ontheauthow rtty ox an evening paper, that the committee for conducting them have recently been making arrangements with the view to their being held In St. Mhattin's hall, but that the Rector of St. Paul s Church, Covent.zarden, within which Varish that building is situate, has interposed the same objection as that taken by Mr. Edouart. of St. Michael's, Burleigh-street, to such services being held In Exeter# balL _
THE LATE RIOT AT LEWES. TO THE EDITOR OF TEiE TIMES. Sir,-It was my earnest wish not to have been compelled to take any public notice of the disgraceful riot whicl& occurred at Lewes on Wednesday last on the occasion of the funeral of a Sister of Mercy. A rery incorrect account, however, having appeared, I am sure I may trust to your sense of justice to permit me to state the facts as they reaUy occurred. It pleased God to take to himself one of the Sisters at St, Margaret's Home, East Grinstead, on Friday the 13th. She died from tho effects of scarlet fever, caught from a caso which the sisters were nursing. On her death bed, having appointed the Superior of St. Margaret's and myself her executors, slAe expressed a wish to be buried in the family vault In the churchyard of her father, the Rev. John Scobell, incumnert of All Saints, Lewes, and that her funeral should be conducted in the way which she consideredl the most Christian. On mentioning these wishes to her fatber on his arrival (which did not take place till after her death), he immec diately acquiesced in both, expressed his willingness that she should be followed to the grave by the other Sisters, anm charged himself with all the arrangements at Lewes, includ ing the prcparation for their reception; he also engaged tl-at the bearers should be respectable and trustworthy men. Contrary to what would have been our wish, and much to our inconvenience, he asked that the funeral might take place in the evening. It was therefore fixed for 5.30 p.m. On our arrival at Lewes the usual procession was formedi.e., lest anything extraordinary should be thought to have been attempted-the bier preceded, myself and the Sistars followed; the only thing beyond an ordinary funeral being a wreath of white flowers carried by an orphan child from. St. Margaret's (unless, indeed, I need mention a white pall, but so trimmed with black as to be perfectly inconspicuous in the twilight. The churchyard lies, I should tbink, about a handred yards from the station. Before reaching it we were joined by gx. Scobell himself and three membersof hisfamily, who rocesded to take their places between ourselves and the bler. The service in the church was read by Mr. Hutchia. son, of West Firle; the uproar, hooting, and yelling in the churchyard-most evidently preconcrted, and that witb considerable skill-being quite alarming. VWith some diffli. caity we made our way to the vault;* it is not attached to the church, butisholowed out of a kind of bank on the north side of the churchyard. Mr. Hutchinson entered the vault, and the service was there concluded; the mob every moment growing fiercer and more threatening. They made way, however, for Mr. ScobeU and his family, as wel as for Mr. Hutchinson. As the former was passing I stepped up to him and said, IMr. Scobell, you see how threatening the mob is; will you not protect the Sisters?" He bowed, and passed on; and that, be it remembered, when his daughter had died in their arms only five days previously. While this was passlng the lights were either extinguished, or so flashed in our faces as to make a confusion worse than darkness. There was a cry of "Do your duty ! Now the performance is to come off." and a rush was inimedi. ately made upon us. The imapression of all of us is that some at least of tho bearers and light-men were the ring. leaders of the mob. But the strangest part of all was that men, certainly in the garb of gentlemnen, could stand by and see ladies dashed this way and that, their veils dragged off, and their dresses torn, and, far from rendering the least assistance, could actually excite the dregs of the rabbla to further violence. I was myself knocked down, and for a moment, while under the feet of the mob, gave myself up for lost. We were borne along into the street, Mr. Scobel having quietly gone home, and tak-ing no further interest in the matter. Some of the sisters took refuge in the schoolmaster's house; some, with myself, in a little public-house caUec the King's Head. Round this inn the mob soon gathered, and were with great difficulty prevented from breaking in. At last, by the advice of the pollce, I made my way across rdens and over walls to the station. A larger force havimg b een now Â£t together were sent back wlth a fly to the King's Read; and thusr after some hard fighting on their part, we were enabled to return to East Grinstead by tho next train, the rabble besetting the station to the very Nlow, Sir, your readers may draw their own conclusions as to the constitution of a Lewes mob-a mob only too no, torious in the annals of lawlessness. A lady who had actu. ally laid down her life in the cause of the poor Is burie4< according to her own wish, in the church of her father, with that father's full acquiescence; is followed to the grave by her executors and by the ladies in whose arms she died; no demonstration is made which could excite any popula, feeling, and the result you have seen. It is onlY right that I should mention the great prompti, tude and kindniess of the schoolmaster, and alo of the railo way officials-a kindness which the Sisters of St. Msrgaret's; on their errands of nursing have invariably experienced. I see It stated in a paper of yesterday that I had attempted at the vault to read some additional prayers at the conclu. sion of the service. This is absolutely and totally false. ere is not a shadow of truth In it; and I should have beern the very lastto have for one moment contemplated so I remain. Sir. vonr. nbh,'Ma,4. ct I J. MI.
