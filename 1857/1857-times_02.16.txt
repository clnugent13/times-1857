One especial feature of the Soclety's work is the great assistance wbich it has ren.-red to the parochial clergy inL the important duty of visiting their :~rorriirisblouers froun house to house, and by the formation of local visiting Oommnittees to draw closer the bands of Christlan sympathy and love. Another strikingly beneficial result of the "~stem carried inoe xetb the Aswetiation is the increased number ofPrvdn Societies and Penny Savings-banks, and the extrardinary amount Of wu.uny deposited by the working classes of the metropolis. I must ever feel, a deep intereet in the succes and progres of the AssOcatton.

EArnest Appeal ;o the Public.-tet
In the winter ofI185, in a thickly populated district at the east end of Reothual-green, a Sunday school was commenced In an tipper room, whore a few poor ebiarun were brought together from the sftrocts. and, with tIre help of my sisters and othLer teachers their number gradually increased, until the room was densely crowdLed.
Thousands of children in this neighbourhood were quito neglected, spending the precious hours of Sunday in playing about the streets, and mining with evil company. Many of these have found a happy home in our school, and, through kind Christiian insluenos, blessed byr the grace of God, have been rescued from destruction, and ace now walking in those ways (f wisdom which are "plensaniness and peace.',,
The numnbers of children having increaed'to such a de:ree, and the health of the Snperiteudert and some of lbs teachers having become Impalredfrom the unhealthy closencesos o room o crowded, an offer was made by the curate of an adjoininig district of the use of a large building in the neighbouirhood, and this offer was gladly accepted. There the children assembled, from the summer ot 1864 till that of 1186, when the building was required for other purpo6es. The children bein thu sudenl derive ofthei sc Oolhuse hoave since then

Rooms have been rented, furnished, and stocked, sat .very conrsiderable coot, and the &saociatlon is proving a boon and a blessing to the neighbourhood, its object being to afford a resort and placea of instrection in the evening for the young mnen when their work is finished.
lt will at once be seen tha5t in order to maitetan this School and Association, it is absoluteiy necessary that a permanent building be provided as soon as possible, and undter the trying and unexpected circumstanoes in which the SchoGol Is iplaced, the President, teachers, and other intereted in this uzenul workr, now eanestly appeal, to Christian friends to aid them in erecting a school-housje for the instruction of the children on week dare as well as Sundays, in this dark and neglected loaIy,weethe population is wrapt In a perpetual winter of wither.
spotof the preset Rchool anid Assoclation has devolved upon tDhePeiet who hat masintained them from the commencemenit, at acsalotequal in amount to the expense of the building now required.
After much negotiation, a most eligible site has been obtained in P'eel-grove, Old F'ord-rood, and thids Appeal is now made so those who look with interest and pity upon tSie population of the parish of Bethnal-green), which, among Ito 90.880 inhabitante, numbers 20,8000 children, who form an ample field-too smote alasl for the meet strenuo)us efforts of EvangelicalChristians of all denominatioTns, The urgent want of such a school, both for Carrying on our present work and for giving increased accommnodation to the miasses of neglected chidren around, promote the friends of this populous distrit to ask for that liberal assistance which is so imperatively needed for the benefit of thiose "who cannot plead for themselves."

Murder and Highway Robbery in Surrey.
MURDER a-nd HIGHWAY BOBBEIRY in SURRZY.,
On Saturday afternoon informatior was received at the Metropolitan Police-station in Scotland-yard of a murder, accompanied by robbery, on the highway between the viHlages of Nutfield and Warwick-town, in Surrey, * draper named Ovenden having been shot with a pistol on his return from Godstone, and robbed of between 41. and 5U. The circumstance has occasioned a good deal of alarm not only in Nutfield, near swhich village the occurrence took place, bnt throughout the whole of the district. The fol-
(owing, as far as we have been able to obtain them, are the particulars of this shocking affair :-Mr. Ovenden had bean to the village of Godstone gn a busiress visit, and was returning io his light cart to Warwick-tawn. About a-qsarter to o o'clock, while proceeding on the road to Notfield, be was accosted by a pedestria, whom he overtook on the road, and wvho asked him for a lift in his cart, stating that he was going to RedhilL The man was dressed as a labourer and had every appearance of being one, and Mr. Ovenden complied with his request. He was accordingly taken up into the cart, and they pssed tbrough Nutfield on their way to Redhill. They had not, however, gone a very great distance from the former village when they arrived at a very dull and lonely part of the road, and 3fr. Ovcnden, from whose statement the information here given has been obtained, was surprised by the man, who was a tall, strongly built felow, suddenly turning towards him and denwandmg his money or his life. At first Mr. Ovenden thought that he was joking, but he was soon fatally undeceived by the man takir- *ut a pockct-pistl and pointing it towards his breast. Still Mr. Ovenden did not apprehend any serious danger, and not wishing to part with his money endeavoured to make it appear that he thoaght the whole affair was a joke. The man, however, assumed a determined aspect and persisted in his demand, and, on Mr. Ovenden, who was now seriously alarmed, refusing to comply, the vilain at once fired the pistol, the bullet of which was lodged in the left breast of his victim, L little below the shoulder; Mr. Ovenden,stillhavingthereinsinhishand, fell to the bottom of the cart, the jerk puling the horse np. The cowardly ruffian then proceeded in the most deliberate manner to rifle the pockets of the unfortunate man, takig from them 41. m 'gold and about lOs. in silver, with which he made off across the country, leaving Mr. Ovenden in a senseless stato at the bottom of the cart. This occurrence took place about 5 o'clock in the afternoon in broad daylight. About a qu&ter-past 5 o'clock Mr. Ovenden, who had been stunned a-d partly paralyzed by the effect of the shot, came to himEelf, and found that he was bleeding from the wound in his shoulder. He managed to stanch the bleeding with a pocket; bankercief, and although much weakened by theloss o7
ntrivd to reach his home at Warwicktown, where hatonce gave information to the police of the attack which bad baeen made upon him, and at the same time lodged in the hands of the police a very accurate description of the fellow who committed the assault. He of course received every medical and surgical ssistance, but on examination it was found that the wound was of a much inore serious character than had at first been imagined. On reaching home he was in a most depressed condition, and, in fact, almost fainting. He was immediately put to bed, but, notwithstanding every attention, information - reached yesterday the Metropolitan police-station thst he expired on Saturday morning. Mr. Norman Wilkinson, a magistrate for the county of Surrey, on hearing of the condition in which the unfortnnate man was, took his dying deposition, in which he gave a very complete description of his assailant. The intelligence received at Scotland-yard by electric telegraph of the death of Mr. Ovenden was accompanied by a handbill offering 1001. reward for the apprehension of the person who committed this atrocious act, and who, froai the evidence already obtained by the pollce, was seen by a party of labourers at a later period of the day asking his way to the villago of Godstone. The following is the descrption of the man taken from the deposition of Mr. Ovenden:-"About six feet in height, light figure, but having large bones, very sallow complexion, high eheek bones, and very hollow in theeceeks near the mouth; dressed in a close box cap, fitting tight to the head, and a short navigator's smockfrock n'uch enmbroidered." The pistol with which the murder was committed was found lying in the bottom of the cart covered with blood. It was an ordinary small pocketpistoL Since the commission of this murder the polce have been unceasing in their exertions to apprehend the fellow, but up to the present moment have been unsuccessful, although it is thought that from the very full description given of him he cannot long eape detect ion.

The Widow Allsop.
THE WIDOW VALLSOP.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIM.
Sir,-I shal feel mr.ch obliged if you will, at your earliest convenience, give me a place in your paper for this letter, it concerning a matter of public interest.
On the 10th inst. you published [in our report from the police court] a letter from Eliz Ailsop, the consequence of which was that a large number of letters have been sent to me containing money for her.
At the time I mentioned Mrs. AiUsop's case to your reporter an officer had been sent to her residence, and I was much impressed in her favour; but I have since had good reason to believe that I have been greatly deceived, and an attempt has been made in your police reports to Stop any more of these letters; but this having failed as they continue to come from all part_ of the country, I saU feel greatly obliged if you will allow me to take this mode of requesting that no more money or letters may be sent for Mrs. Aillsop. I reserve all the money, together with the letters, for the present, and vhen the case is completed the public, through you, shall be informed of the result
But there is connected with the subject a matter that has pwined me much. I allude to the attacks that have been madeinsomepapers upon his RoyalHighness PrinceAlbert, and it is belonging to truth and justice that they should be contradicted as soon as possible. I have reason to know that his Royal Highness distributes his charities with a liberal hand; but surely he would not be doing his duty to the ublic if he were to distribute with an indiscriminatihn
hand; and I know aLo that Mrs. AUlsop petitioned as early as 1848, and that according to the directions laid down for the invariable guidance of those intrsted with the distribation of the charity of the Queen and the Prince, Mrs. inqired case *ppearing to be one deserving assistance was inquirunto in aud her petion as reported upon by the Mendicity Society, for whose valuable aid in the recommendation of deserving cases and the detection of imposition the advisers of the Prince are under great obliga-
This petition was the first of a series of begging letters which has continued ever since.
The Mendicity Society made a long report in 1848, which states, among other matters, "That she is living in a common lodging-bouse, and derives her support entirely from begging, which she systematiclly pursue3." Then follows a very bad account of her habits.
And now, Sir, I rpoeal to you whether, after the unfavourable result of this inquiry, it was not the imperative duty of the Prince to refuse to attend to her many and reputed begging letters.
But I wishing to give her every chance, am allowing her to prove, if she can, that she ever had any sons under the circumstances she states. In her petition to the Prince there is no mention of any sons killed at Cabul - nor is there any mention, in her petition to the Queen, of any sons in the Crimea. And I have communicated with several clergymen who have known her for years, but who never heard of these sons.
Can there be a doubt, Sir, as to the line of duty to be pursued in this case ? and yet his Royal Highness is to be attacked for the course he did take. Surely, the authors of these attacks will see how untrue and unjust they are.
Pray, Sir, excuse the length of tbis letter.
I have the honour to be your obedient servant.

COLLEGE OF DENTISTS.-On Saturday evening the
COLLEGE OF DENTiSS.-1On Saturday evening the
inaugural meeting of the members of this college was held in the concert-room, Hanover-square, which was crowded by all the leading dentists of the metropolis. The chair was taken at 8 o'clock, andthe secretary having read letters of apology from Lord Stanley, Baron Bramwell, and other distinguished personages, the inaugural address was delivered by the president of the college, Mr. Robinson, who was received y the meeting with continued cheers. After referring to t e ongin of the college, and the unanimity and satisfaction with which it had been greeted by the mass of the profession, the speaker went on to detail the rise of dental surgery, a practice for which be claimed a most remote antiquity, and which the discovery of both false and stopped teeth in Egyptian sarcophagi sufficiently proved. Bet though the ancients deserved treat credit for the attention which their authors show them to have paid to the subject, it was not till the end of the 16th century that the dental art began to be studied with the care which its iraportance deserved. Many treatises were then pinted, and an attempt was made to classify the diseases of the teeth by Fouchard, who was justly considered as the father of modern dental science, and who pointed out the indications which the teeth, in common with the adjacent parts, furnished of the general state of health. From that time such rapid advarces were made in the stady that in 1772 the great John Hunter did not consider it derogatory to his reputation to give the profession the result of his dental investigations in his great work on the Natural History of Teeth Their Transatlantic brethrern had also done much in the wall-s of dental rhysioloRy and patlaology they held a high place in the pro ession and had establishe colleges, though not without struggling with the same difficulties at the outset which they themselves had had to overcome. Much had been sad about tbeir wish to adopt the plans of the Americans, especially with respect to their colleges, but their only object was to give to professional skil in this country its rightful pre-eminence, and to crush the charlatanism which, in so many instances, had preyed uponx the p-ablic health and purse. He believed the result which their labours would achieve would he to give such an elevation to their professional charact3r as would command for thie diploma of the Collcge of DenissofEgland the respect of that and every oethe onr where dental science was practised. On tth motion of Dr. Roberts, seconded by Dr. Bate, the thanka of the meeting ere pased by acclamaition to the President, who brnefl expressed his acknowledgments and read a list of the course of lectures to be delivered ir the ensuing session. The meeting then proceeded to examine the various preparations connected with dental surgery which were displayed about the room in sufficient profuson to appal the stoutest nerves. Long row of cold, bright instruments made the non-professional spec. tator cold and nervous, and every dental blemish in his syMtemn to twinge with sympathetic agony at sight of the bluut determined.looldug forcps, which seemed constructed so as never to let o. Clever preparations of skulls were there in which all tose il-conducted little nerves that go to consttute a " raging tooth" were laid bare and exposed topublic scrutiny and indignation. The wals, too, were grin with dreadful sketches of aU 1' the ils which teeth are heir to. One of those lively pencilings showed the hack tooth of a megatherium-a dental monstrosity about the size and shape of an ordinary wardrobe, and which, as it never could have been " extracted," we pre. xume was only done to show the sllM with which it might be "drawn," The proceedings of the evening terminated early,

The Financial Statement.
THE FINANCIA STATEMBNT.
(From the EcOnomist.)
Alfter the discussions which took place on the first night of the session, the public must be agreeably surprised at the amount of the estimates as now presented to Parliament for the War Dopartments. On that night arguments were founded and charges made on the assumption that in the second year of the peace the country would stiUl find itself gaddld with an expenditeur for those departments amornting to not less than 25,000,0001. Now, however, that the truth is before the country, we find the amount to be just over 19,900,0001. But this includes a sum in round figures of 600,0001. for the Coastguard, which has been transferred from the Customs' department to the Admiralty during the pest year, andanothersum of morethan 900,0001 for the postal packet service, which cannot be regarded in any sbape as an expenditure of the War Department. Deducting these two sums, we have tFe real cost of the army aud naval departments reduced to 18,410,000l.
But though much progress may have been already made towards bringing down the expenditure for these great serTices to that of the ordinary peace establishments, yet unfortunately the war bas left behind it the usual disagreeable legacy of an increased annual charge upon the finces of the country in the form of back reckonings to be cleared p, and of certain additions to the interest of the public debt Compared, however, with former times, these assume in the prezeut instance a very modified shape. At the end of the French war, which lasted from 1792 to 1815, with but short intermissions, the increase which took place in the capital of the national debt exceeded 600,000,0001. sterling, involving an additional annual charge of fully 20,000,0001 During the late war the entire amount raised by loans in every shape was 41,000,0001. Of this 26,000,0001. consisted of an addition to the funded debt; 7,00D, 00.L of Exchequer-bonds, redeemable t specified periods, and 8,000,000l, of Exchequer-billk It is true that the whole amount authorized by Parliament to be raised was 44,000,0001., but of the last borrowing power given by Parliamnent, in the shape of an issue of Exchequer-bills to the amount of 4,0,0001., the Chancellor of the Exchequer has exercised it only to the extent of 1,000,000l, thus reducing the expenditure of the current year by 3,000,000w below what appeared probable at the close of last session.
Let us now examine how far theme obligations of the war must affect our expenditure during the next few years. Parliament and the public, animated by the persuasive eloquence of the late Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gladstone), began the war with the virtuous determination that, as far as was practicable, the expenditure of each year should be paid out of the income of the year, The income-tax was increased; the malt duty,ithe sugar duty, and other Cus. toms duties were also increased; but an increase of taxation does not at once result in an increase of revenue paid into the Exchequer, while, on the other hand, the expenditure of a war is urgent and immediate. Under these circumstances Exchequer-bonds to the amount of 6,00,0001. were disposed of, avowedly as an anticipation of future taxes. Of these bonds 2,000,000l faU due in May next; 2,000,0001. in May, 1858; and 2,000,0001. in 1859; the remaining 1,000,0001. of bonds, issued subsequently, faU due in 180 Then there is the interest of the 26,000,0001. of funded debt and of the unfunded debt, which may be putdown at 1,400,000. a-year. But the simple interest is not all. In consenting to add to the funded debt Parliament, acting in the same wise spirit which had animated its first efforts to raise the income of the year to anx equivalent of the expenditure, deliberately decided by a large majority that at least a provIsion should bo made for redeeming an equal amount of the permanent funded debt within a reasonable period, Accordingly, by the act granting the loan of 16,000,0001, it was provided that after the war a sum of
,000,000. should be annually expended in the reduction of tiedebt. Similarprovisions weremsertedin the acts granting the two subsequent loans of 5,000,0001. each, by means of which every trace of the late war wiU be removed from our financial accounts in some 16 years.
But, in the meantime, these remnants o: the war, belonging just as much to it as the war taxes which we have paid for the last three years, will bear somewhat heavily upon the finances of the country, and especially during the next four years, when the bonds are in course of payment. In tho next financial year we must, for example, rovide for 2,000,0001. of bonds falling due in May, and almo for the increased charge to the funded and unfunded debt, which cannot be less, including the sinking fund, than 1,650,0001. more; here, then, we have a war expenditure of 3,650,000. to meet in the coming yerr. Next year we shall have a similar claim, and the further piyment of the sinking fund in addition, which wiU make a war expendituro of fully 4,900,0001. in 1858-9; and in 1859-60 we shaU be exposed to a sinilar expenditure. After that year the traces of the war will rapidly become less onerous, and, as at the same time a large amount of terminable annuities swil fall in, there may in 1860 be a fair opportunity of an extensive reduction and remodelling of our taxation.
Such is the substance of the case presented to the Uouse of Commons last night by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The actual war estimates have disappeared:-The portion of the income-tax imposed for the war he entirely gives up, and brings it down to the rate at which it stood in 1854 at the commencement of the war, The rate of 7d. in the pound, with which 12 years of profound peace, but of great fiscal reforms, had made us familiar is to be continued three years longer. In 1860 Parliament wiU have the opportunity of again dealing with the whole question, as lr. Gladstone provided in 1853 that it should. But when Mr. Disraeli talks of the compact of 1853, by which the incometax, terminating in 1860, thould be reduced first to 6d. and then to 5d. in the meantime, it was not contemplated that we should have to encounter aRussianwar; and it was just as much a breach of any implied compact entered into in 1853 that the income-tax shonld be raised from 7d. to 16d. during the war, in place of beinE reduced to 6d. as provided by the act of 1853, as it woed be now to continue the income-tax at 7d. for three years in order to redeem the obligations of the war, in place of allowingit to drop at once to 5d.
But the priniple adopted during the war, by which the new taxes were raised, was that direct and indirect taxation should each bear a part. According to the actual provisions of the acts as they stand, the increased tea and sugar duties would have been diminished one-half in the comimg year and one-half in thefollowingyear. Sir GeorgeLewis proposes that, in place of their terminating in two ye3rs, the reduction shaU be thrown over fouryears; and by this means the same principle wiU be maintained, of redeeming the obligations of the war partly from both descriptions of taxes. But there 5s another reason which has influenced the Chancellor of the Exchequer. At the presert time there is a great dearth of sugar. The stocks in London are 43,700 tons, as against 73,400 tons two years ago X and, with regard to tea, the unfortunate war with China threatens to limit our supplies much below the ordinary quantity. A reduction of duty under such circumstances would therefore be of little benefit to the jmblic; the loss incurred by the revenle would mairly go to add to the profits, already very great, of theholders and importers, rom these twofol considerations,-first, the obvious fairress of distributing the burdens left by the war in justproportions among all classes, but in a way not to be mch felt by any, and next, that any present considerable reduction in the duties on tea and sugar, from the peculiar circumstances of the market, would be no relief to the general consumer-the ChanceUor of the Exchequer appears to be fully justified in the coesrse he has adopted; nor wiU any one object to a reasonable delay, provided nothing be permitted to interfere with the ultimate reduction of the tea duty to Is. the pound, and the sugar duty to 10s. the cwt. And those are the points to which the proposal of the ChanceUor of the Exchequer ultimately leads.

Retirement Of The Lord Chancellor.-The
RMREsx-IrT oF T}IE LORD CsaAzcELuou.-The grand difficulty of the Government moves the sympathy of its friends, and it has caled up a rather curious speculation. The apparent piecessity which lies on a Liberal Ministry to have Lord Cranworth as Lord Chancellor revives a belief in predestination, and confirms the Mussulman idea of fate.
hose who are less inclined to yield to the superstitious despondency naturally induced by the faets cannot forberr the more irritating inquiry, How it is that there should be such a phenomenon at all. We have the official head law reformer rendering law reform impossible. That Lord Cranworth's desire for law reform is sincere we all believe. How, then, can we account for his actions? Ought we not to have a special commission dc Can. cdlario vnqitrendo I He introduces three bills to amend the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and he is the first to raise a question as to the propriety of this provision or of that omission. The Peer who is most obviously bound to move an amendment on tbe bills, if not to move that they be read any day six months, is Lord Cranworth. Under what fatality does he introduce what he condemns, or damn with inevitable defeat what he desires e is so impartial that his convictions go one way, his conduct the other. He is so devoted to law reform that he can be content with nothing but an impossible perfection. The inquiry might extend to the question whether the Lord Chancellor most wishes the success of his own bills or otherwise. But there aLre yet larger questions. Ys there no vigourawong the law reformers, that they must submit to be estopped by this obstruction ? Is law reform to be arrested in order that the country may be blessed with a Cranworth for its ChanceUor? The inevita'sle effect of placing him on the woolsack was as well known as the effect of putting a cork into the neck of a bottle. There is therefore some higher fatality. How is it that the Liberal Administration of the day must take to itself that particular law lord? It wiU destroy the Government if it goes on. How, then, to rescue the Government ?-that is now the practical question. Can the country only get rid of the Cranworth Chancellorship by removing tho Palmerston Administration ?

INEFFICIRMT LEGISLATIO.
TO THE EDITONR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Allow me to direct your attention to the following facts:-In July, 1852, Mr. Clay was elected member for HulL In Mfarch, 183, he was unseated for bribery and treating, the committee reporting that corrupt practioes extensively prevailed at the election. In April the House of Commons addressed the Crown to appoint a commission to inquire into the alleged corrupt doings at the last and at any former election. Thereportof the commission waspresented in 184, and measureswere introduced topreventarecurrenco of this corraption. Only one of these bills passed the House of Commons, and the House of Lords was induced to rescind their standing order against receiving an biUl so late in the session on the ground that, unless the bill became law, no writ could be iasued for a new election at HulU and four other delinquent boroughs. This bill is the 17th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 102, "An ActtoConsolidate and Amend the Laws relating to Bribery, Treating, and undue Influence, &c.," which consolidation and amendment were to continue for two years, and have since been extended tiU the end of this current session. The election for Hull took
lace immediately after the passing of the act, and Mr. Watson now Baron of the Exchequer, was elected, on 'whose eWevation to the bench Mr. Clay was again returned. It is a singular tribute to Parliamentary skiU and discretion that this gentleman's eligibility should have been Specialll conferred on him by an act intended to stigmatize him. ,
this 17th and 18th Victoria had never passed he would have been disqualified from sitting for Hull during the whole of this Parliament by virtue of the 5th and 6th Victoria, chap. 102, sec. 22, repealed by the more recent statute. The Legislature intended to extend the disqualification for treating to include bribery and undue influence. Nowv since bnbery formerly wrought disqualification only for ther return procured by bsiberyt and since the offence of undue influence was first defined b this consolidating statute, the clause infficting disqualfication for either or any of these offences cannot be interpreted as merely declaratory, far less as retrospective. Mr. Clay's disability was incurred under a statute since repealed, and, since he has not transgressed theprovisions of the repealing statute, his seat is unassailable. Whether tis result was intended by Parliament is anotherquestion; statutes must be interpreted to say what they mean, not what they are meant to mean. It was promised last session that this " Corrupt Practices Pseveniton Act" should be referred to a committee this session, to inquire into its operation. If the fruit of such deliberation be another bribery bill, may we hope that it will not be framed so as to confer immunity for offences which it designs to punish?

How Ships May Be Lost.
HOW SHIPS MAY BE LOST.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Under the above title you did me the honour to insert, a few weeks since, a letter in your world-wide columns. I complained that incorrect charts were habitaally sold and habitualy used, and I specified a glaring case of flagrant error. In consequence of that letter I have received many comnmunications,-somo of them of great importance and extreme courtesy, others of gross insolence and gross ignorance. I have been requested to specify the char' complained of- but, as I wish to injure no ship, no shop, and no person, i have declined all allusion to particulars, which might be used as advertising puffs by opposing chart-makers, whose own productions may, for avght 1 know, be as incorrect as the others. But I have endeavoured to fathom the real reason wvhy the beautiful charts prepared by the Admiralty are not sold by chartseUers, and I think I have discovered it. If this be worthy of your favourable notice, I beg leave to state precisely what I conceive to be the reason - and, as a ship's crew and passengers, to say nothing of the property, may be actually dependent on a proper chart (for I recently sailed with a man not a seaman, who had been obliged to take charge of a brig and to navigate her, in consequence of the master being exhausted with five days and nights upon deck), it inay not be unworthy of The Times to notice a circumistance in which orphans and widows a'e not altogether uninterested parties. A few days since I went into a shop in the largest seaport of Scotland, and asked to look at a eart of the west coast, with the intention of purchasing. I was shown a chart of the Hebrides, for which I was asked 8s. That chart-the one commonly sold and used -is so incorrect thst the fifth degree of west longitude runs through the centre of the Island of Arran, whereas on. the Admiralty chart the same Hne of longitude clears tho island altogether. This fact I publiely assert, and will produce the charts i! necessary-namely, that the ordinary chart of the Hebrides used by ships and yachts has the fifth degree of west longitude rmnning throuzh the Islaud of Arran, and that on the Admiralty chart the same line goes outside of the island altogether. But, to know that a chart is incorrect is one thing, and to know the reason why it continues to be sold is another, a different, and perhaps more difficult thing, and therefore I would endeavour to explain this important fact. In this shop the salesman was an intelligent young man, and I asked him if he had no otber charts. "Oh, yes," he replied, and pulled out a large drawer. This drawer I saw, and in it saw many bundles or rolls of paper. "W What are those, if you please," I asked. " Oh, those are only cbeap things, from 2is. to half-acrown." "Will you aUow me to see them ?' I said. And, teeing them, I saw that they vere the Admiralty charts which were despised for sale because they were so cheap. And this I believe to be the real and true reason for erroneous cbarts being stiUl sold. They are pressed upon the purchaser because there is more profit on them, whereas the Admiralty charts are scarcely to be had for asking, because it is not the intention of the shopkeeper to sell them if he can sell tho others. This is the genuine explLuationof thecontinued abuse; and, thoughGovernment interference should be avoided by aU means, if possible, this case murst be regarded as a case of maritime police, requiring correction, exactly as if a druggist were seling
isonous articles under the form of medicines. It must obsened that this is not a question as to whether there are or are not good and correct charts ready for a purchaser, but whether there are or are not bad and incorrect charts habitually offered for sale, and sold. knowingly because there is a much larger profit on them.
-No remarks I have made on this subject could possibly be construed into the slightest reflection on the splendid labours. of Captain Robinson and the other officers who produced. the AdmIralty charts.
I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant.

THE AUSTRALIAN MA,I.-SOUTHAMPTON, Feb. 14.-The European and Australian Royal Mail Company's steamship Columbian, Captain Pender, which left this port on tho 14th ult., arrived off the island of St. Vincent s at 2 a.m. on the 23d, thus making the pa ge from the Needles in eight days and seven hours. Her average speed througbout was 12 knots per hour, and on three consecutive daya the runs were 315, 310, and 300 nautical miles. The weAther at Porto-Grande vas very unfavourable; stron winds and dark oloudy weather, with rain. Rollers ha: set in with a violence which had only been experiencedonce before during the last 20 years. On this account great diffictlty was experienced in coaling, and the Columbian was detained four days. She sailed thence for Australia on the 27th. The passengers were alR well, ind expressed themselves highly satisfied with the ship and all the arrangements on board. The ship on leaving had a total stock of 1,400 tont of fuel on board, and it was intended that she should proceed direct to M1elbourne, without calling an
more on the way thither. The mails of the present month will be conveyed in the Etna steamer, of 2,215 tons and 500 horse-powear, wihich is to leave Southampton on the 24th inst., and proceed to Alexandria, whence they will be carried overland to SUes; after this the mails by this route will leave Soathampton on the 12th of each month.
CO,6uis A1ND CONSULAR LW.-On Saturday afternoon a meeting was held at the rooms of the Law Amendlment Society, under the direction of the Mercantile Law Committee of the United Kingdom, to consider the laws relating to consuls and consular duties. Lord Brougham presided. Mr. E. W. A. Tnson, Chancellor of the Austrian Consulate, read a paper on the subject of consular law. tracing down the office and the enactments connected with it from a remote period. The paper entered with care into aU the laws relating to consular duties, and the recent responsibilites attached to the office by the power to solemnize marriages, administer vvills, and discharge notarial duties. The varied and exteneive powers given to our mercantile representatives in the Levant and China were also dwelt upon, with the laws which prohibited consuls enga&ing in trade, and the manifold irregularities and impropneties which arose frdm a breach of the latter wholesome rule. Mr. Tuson recommended that in all cases the grounds upon which a British consul resided in foreigu countries should be clearly defined and laid down, as was the case between France, Belgium, and tho United SSates; that under no circumstances a foreigner should be permitted to act as' British consul, nor any be alUowed to engage in trade. The consular Cldcs should be trained for the performance of their duties by study in the Consular Department of the Foreign-office, by the preparation of a well-arranged code for their instruction, including the chief provisions of the Mterchant Shipping Act. He strongly objected to the present system of appointing half-pay naval and military officers or bankrupt merchants. The nobe president, in thanking MIr. Tuson for his able paper, expressed his entire concurrence in the systerm of training for consular duties which had been suggested, and also in the necessity for prohibiting our consuls from enga gin in trade or commercial speculations, Clu the moio ofMr. Ewart. M.P., seconded by MIr. Headlam, \LP., the thanks of the meeting were voted to Mr. Tuson for his paper, whick was refcrred to the attentive consideration of the Mercantile Law Committee. 3fr.

THE ELECTIONS.
(FROMx OUR OWIT CORR1ESPONDMYT.)
DUBLIN, SATURDAY MORrNLG.
The strength of parties in the House of Commons is not likely to undergo any change as far as the result of the Irish elections is to be taken into account. Bandon borough, true to its old traditions, has umnistakeably pronounced against the attempt to open its gates for the admission of Liberalism, even in the most diluted form, and has ayain chosen a member of the Bernard family as the fittest man for the situation. Mr. John Bagwell will probably enter Parliament as the successor of Captain John O'Connell, and, having, cast aside his old Tory principles, will, of course, honestly adhere to the new creed, and take his stand in the ranks of the more advanced Whigs. Downpatrick exchanges the Hon. Mr. (now Lord) Hardinge, moderate Conservative, for Mr. R. Ker, who professes pretty nearly the same political creed, but is on somie questions (the religious, for instance) rather in advance of his predecessor. In Limerick county there will be no change, and the new President of the Board of Health wiiU be free to enter upon his duties in the middle of the ensuing week. The retirement from the representation of Londonderry of Captain Bateson, by many degrees the most popular of the Irish Derbyite members, coupled with the fact that failing health has been the cause of hiz abandonment of Parliamentary life, is sincerely deplored by aU parties here. There will a brisk and, probably, c]ose contest for the seat thus left vacant. A letter from Londonderry says:-
" hIr. Bateson, who has sat for this county during several years, is a stanch Conservative, and a man of some note among the ranks of Lord Derby's supporters. Under the Administration of that nobleman he was a Lord of the Treasury, and discharged for his party those useful Parliamentary duties which Mr. Heyter now so efriciently performs for the Government of Lord Paliserston. No official address has yet been published, but from letters which have been appearing in the local papers, as well as from other reliable indications, it is known that Sir HerveyBruce, of Downhill-house means to try his fortune on the Conservative side. There is scarcely room to doubt that Sir Hervey will come forward, and should he do so he will in all probability have for his opponent Mfr. S. M. Greer, the defeated candidate at the last election. The hon. baronet seems to depend very much on the landlord interest; but at the same time he is not inimnical to a fair adjustment of the existing differences respecting the land question. His polities are Liberal Conservative. He is pretty sure of receiving the unanimous suppart of the county gentry, although among them there is some slight diversity of opinion as to the propriety of Lr. Bateson's resignation at the present juncture. Sir Hervey Bruce is also understood to hold a high position in the Orange institution, which circumstance must insure him an important share of the elective suffrages in a county like Londonderry. Hlowever, he has on two occasions, I believe, unsuccessfully contested the borough of Coleraine, for -which Lord Naas is now the member. A third candi. date is spoken of in the person of Mr. Robert Peel Dawson, of Castledawson, son of the late Right Hlon. George Robert Dawson, Chairman of the Board of Excise. Mr. Dawson is said to be of the LiberalConservative party, with rather more demnocratic views of tenant-right than are generally entertained by country gentlemen. There is, however, hardly a chance of
is contesting the representation at present. One thing is certain, that the contest-if contest there he-between Sir Hervey Bruce and Mr. Greer will be of the keenest deserttion, supposing the fact of nearly the whole of the available names being on the registry to he any indication of the value attached to electoral nghts in this county."
THE CIRCUXLOC-TI(0N OFFICE.
Alludinz to the cost of some 5,000,0001. for the conveyance of troops which appears in the year's estimates, the Diei,liss Mail narrates the following anecdote apropos of the military goods traffic question:-
" Some two or three years ago (during the war) it was thought necessary to convey some military stores from the Tower to Queenstowin for embarcation there. Those goods were carried in waggons from the Tower to Euston-square terminus, thence by railway to Liverpool, and thence by steamer to Dublin. They were carted through this city to King's-bridge terminus, brought along the Great Southern and Western Rtailway to Cork, and thence to Queenstown, we believe, by water. The expense of this miode of transit was, we have been informned, 81. l0s. per ton. At the very same time a steamer sailed for Cork, from Hartley's steamwharf, London-bridge, regularly every Thursday, by which those military stores mnight have been conveyed into Queenstown harbour for 30s. a-ton. The very smallness of this fact but serves to demonstrate the greatness of tise stupidity which regulates the performance of the public service. When the officials saw so indistinctly what was before their eyes on the Tower-wharf, what measure of acuteness is to be allowed for their vision of things occurrirg at Malta, Constantinople, and Balaklava ?"
ATTEMPTED AS5SASSINATION.
The following communication appears in Satotders's Newsletter of this morning:--
" Ballinasloe, Friday Evening.
It is with deep regret that I have to report the disturbance of the tranquillity which h2as hitherto reignel throughout this district. Yesterday evening Mr. George Harrison, who occupies the extensive farm of Dromlagagh, under Colonel Maberly, arrived here from Dublin, where he had been on business, and, having been met bv his own servant and car, proceeded homewards, having a distance of about five miles to drive. On arriving within about 200 yards of his own house Mr. Harrison observed that the horse was attracted by something on the way, and called to the servant to drive on. The driver having applied the whip the animal moved suddenly towards the side of the road, and at that moment a gun was discharged by a man who crouched behind a large holy bush at a short distance. The gun used had a flint on the lock, and, a vivid flash having proceeded from the pan, Mr. Harrison distinctly saw the man on one knee taking deliberate aim at him. For. tuna'ely, the sudden movement of the horse saved Mr. Harrison's life, as the contents of the piece must have passed behind himi. The would-be assassin immediately decainped, and Mr. Harrison not being armed did not attempt to follow him, but drove with all speed to his residence. This day he came into Ballinasloe, when an inquiry on oath was held by Mr. A. C. Montgomery, R.M., with the view of taking steps to bring the offender to justice. While I write MIr. Patrick Sweeny, S.I., with a detachment of the constabulary from the Ballinasloe station, is proceeding to the scene of outrage, and will scour the country for miles round. Mr. Harrison is an exceedingly inoffensive man, and is much respected by all who know him. It is therefore difficult to ascertain any reason for this attempt on his life. Having made some inquiries I find that Dronilagagh is part of the St. George property, and was purchased by Colonel Maberly in the Encumbered Estates Court. The principal part of the property was leased to Mr. Harrison, a farmer from Northumberland. It was resolved to remove five smaller tenants, wvho were old occupiers, Mr. Harrison actirig as agent to Colonel Maberly. These tenants were two years in arrears last May, but the Colonel had no desire to act harshly, anid accordingly it was agreed they should give up their holdings on the lst of May next, receiving each a gratuity in hand of one year's rent for leaving. They had been duly evicted, but the decrees were not put in force, they having agreed to the terms specified. Suspicion rests strongly on one man, who used, a abort time since, threatening Language for having been reused potato ground. Of course it is impossible to identify any individual, but it is hoped Government will hinsea reward for such information as may lead mbithe of the of the intended ttssa n."helprehe
THIE IRISH: IN AMIERICA.
IThe subjoined exutract from a New Orleans letter, published in one of the Linerick papers, must be ionsidered, if true, as a notice to quit for the timely information of all Celts who may be ambitious of sohe rights of citizenship under the shelter of the *United States .
"I mustsaytoyoa that for an Irishmnan this is no country nny more. Hostiity to him and to his holy religion is now
te order of the day with numbers of fanatical Americans. In a word, insolent hatred and deep prejudice have led some of them even to murder poor and unoffending men. It is not safe to go out of doors after dark; a perfect reign of terror has prevailed here during the last three months.
Hitherto, to witness a riot was not thought of; but, God help us every morning the news or the question is common -, Whno was kIlled last night ?' The most respectable of the
Irish families here speak of emigrating to the Brazils or Buenen Ayres. One word more: this is no country for an
Irishman any longer. I am sorry to acknowledge it."

EXCUIIBEvDIB ESTATES COMMISsION.
It is announed this evening that the appointment of Chief Commissioner, in succession to Baron Richards, has been conferred on Mfr. Serjeant OBrien, M.P. By this quite unexpected arrangement a vacancy will be created in the representation of the city of Limerick. The salary of Chief Com-
nissioner is fixed at 3,0001. a-year. The selection of the learned serjeant over a whole host of candidates has failed to give anything like general satisfadion.
TIPPERARY BANK ELIIGATION.
The struggle between the creditors and the shareholders having virtuaUy terminated in favour of the former by the abandonment of the Parliamentary bill of settlement, the floodgates of litigation are to be again opened in the Dublin law courts. It appears that an intimation has been given to all parties concerned that the appeals from the decision of the Rols' Court, including-the celebrated case of Ginger and the other English shareholders, the hearing of which was postponed pending the fate of
the biU in the House of Commons, are again sst down in the Chancellor's list, and, that they will be
argued as soon as the state of business in that court will permit. About the fir8sbweek in March, it is thought, the Tipperary Bank dramg will be repro-
duced, first in the equity and shortry afterwards ia all the other courts.
PREROGATIVE COURT, SATURDAY.
PIMTEST OF A CATHIOLIC CLERGYMAN AGALNST BEING
SVORN UTPON THE PROTESTANT VERSION OF THE BIBLE.
The csse of * Keefe v. Flanagan" having been called
Dr. WILEY stated that the Rev. Mr. O'Farrell, of Upper Gardmner-street, wvas in attendance for the purpose of being examined on the part of his (Dr. Wiley's) chient, but that the rev, gentleman, having scruples as to b.ging sworn on the P rotestant version of the Bible, considered that ho should be allowed to be sworn on his own Bible. ie (Dr. Wiley) apprehended that under the 1st and 2dof Victoria the Court not only had power, but wps obliged to administer to a witness an oath under the form which he considered most binding on his conscience. That act was framed forthe purpose of respecting the religious scruples of persons, and of allowing theni to be sworn in the manner most satisfactory to their consciences. It provided that an oath should be binding which was administered in the form wFhich the party swvorn conceived to be most binding, and that a person might be indicted for perjury in case of false swearing, as if all the usual forms were observed in taking the oath.
Judge RADCLIFFE,in giving judgmenton the point raised, said that he considered he was not at liberty to yield to the application to allow the rev. gentleman to be sworn on his own Bible. The rev. gentleman believed that the usual form of oath, if taken, was binding. Catholic archbishops and bishops, and other dignitaries of the Catholic Church, were every day sworn, without any objection on their part on the authorized version of the Bible. The scruple of the rev. gentleman in the present case-which, if it were a scruple, would no doubt be shared by all of his churchamounted only to this, that he would prefer being srvorn upon the Douay version of the Bible. In his (Judge Radcliffe's) opinion, the rev. gentleman was bound to take his oath on the authorized version of the Bible, and he would direct him to be sworn accordingly.
The Rev. Mr. O'Farrell then took the book, observing that he consented to be sworn lmder protest, because he felt serious scruples as to being sworn on a version of the Bible which his church would not allow him to receive.
The oath was then administered in the usual form.

Sacred Harmonic Society.
SACRED HRBMONIC SOCIEfTY.
There was a great deal to commend unreservedly in the first performance for the season of Mfr. Costa's Eli; but, on the whole, the progress made since last year hardly came up to expectation. Occasionally, indeed, and especially in the execution of some of the choruses, a retrograde movement was noted, which caused no little surprise among those able to discern how comparatively easy is tho music of Bi viewed in conjunction with that of many oratorios and other sacred compositions familiar to the patrons of Exeter-hall. It would be worth another rehearsal (of the chorus alone, we -mean-the band and solo singers were admirable) to remedy a falling-off not exactly creditable to the members, whose veneration for their accomplished conductor is notorious The honour recently acquired (and so weU merited) in the Lobgesang and Athalie of Mendelssohn, the Requiem of Mozart, and the Stabat Afatsr of Rossini-all, except the last, much more elaborate and difficalt than Eliought not to be lightly periUed. The Sacred Harmonic Society has advanced several steps in the estimation of judges, owing to some imusually good performances this season, and it behoves all who have its welfare and reputation at heart to use their inpuence in the establishment of such discipline as may place retrogression at least beyond the sphere of probability. The motto of the society should be " Excelsior." It has now attained a position which justly entitles it to be considered the foremost institution of its kind In the world. 'Under these circumstances it cannot anticipate the more lenient criticism which other societies of less pretensions look for and obtain. The Sacred Harmonic Society maynow be almost regarded in the light of a national institution-amateur though it be. During the process of years it has expanded from an insignificant knot of choristers into a formidable bodycorporate, uniting aU the elements of musical performance on the grandest possible scale-in short, not merely an advantage, but a necessity to art. When the comn miittee engaged Mr. Costa to. direct the rehearsals and performances they threw down the gauntlet to public opinion, and invited searching criticism no less than honest praise, Under these circumstances the society cannot afford even to repose upon its laurels, much less by going back to incur the chance of forfeiting them. If there are defects in its constitution that tend to cramp and fetter the executive department they must be investigated and done away with. We have reason to beieve that such defects exist, and that unless they are successfuly (however gradually) eradicated, perfection in choral singing, which should be the chief aim of the society-since the chorus is at once its boast and distinguishes it among the great musical institutions of Europe-must be abandoned as unattainable. A few chance performances of uncommon exceUence (the result. no doubt, of uncommon vigilance) are not enough. Every performance, allowing for the slight fluctuations inevitable in all such undertakings, should be up to a certain standard of exceUence. The single performance of Elijah this season, though generaly effective and good, was not precisely what the first night of the Lobgesang and Requiem, and what both occasions on which .&aa ie and the Staoat were given, had led everyone to expest. The execution of Mr. Costa's Bli was in many respects far less satisfactory, and, as the errors and shortcomings were traceable to the chorus,a strict examination into the faUings of that veryimportant department-whetherthose failingsbe constitutional ormerely incidentaland adventitious-is indispensable. Soonerorlater,iftheSacred Harmonic Society isresolved to maintain its position,such a step wiMl be taken, and the minutes of theinvestigationacteduponwithuncompromislng energy. What we have said, then, must be accepted as an earnest of regard for the society, and of interest in its continued and increasing prosperity. It has created a taste for the loftiest compositions of the masters of the sacred style,-a taste which yearly becomes more fastidious. The arduous task of keeping pace with the improved knowledge of the pubUc, and the exigencies arising from such an altered condition of things, devolves upon it, therefore, naturally enough. The growth of the Sacred Harmonic Society is one of the artistic phenomena of this busy ageand now, in its rips maturity, it can no longer be encouragedinprattling like a child, but must speak with the clearness and emphatic vigour that belong to manhood. lt has set itself a task, and must not shrink from its complete accomplishment.
Without going into details we maybrieflystate that thefuU pieces with which connoisseurs felt most dissatisfied was the scene of the " Ungodly Revel." Here the marked distinction intended by the composer to aid his hearers in separating the denunciations of the priests from the boisterous saturnalia in which the sons of Eli are engaged with the women outside the Temple was by no means clearly indicated, so that the effect, instead of being dramatic and suggestive, was confused. The most striking piece in the oratorio-the fugued chorus in G minor, " So persecute them with thy tempest," in the scene of the "invocation" (where the march of the Israelites occurs), suffered equally from want of precision and from waverin
intonation. These were the most noticeable instances of faulty execution. It is unnecessary to particularize others after the general remarks we have made above. But to proced to a more agreeable duty-that of praise. Te choruses presenting least to criticize were the " Amen" in "Blessed be the Lord," which went with Mater precision than its companion fugue at the end of
art I. Hosauna, Hosanna in the Highest 1"), although that was not without some fize points of execution ; the two chorales (I" How mighty is Thy name," and "0 make a joyful noise"), in both of which the subject of the overture appoars-in the first as a bass, in the second as a treble part; te round, or canon, in C (" The Lord is good"), and the chorus of angels in A dat ( " No evil shall befall thee") which were rendered with admirable delicacy of tone. These were good enough to redeem much that was less efficient. The overture and all the accompaniments were played to perfection by the band; and f rowasmith exhibited his accustomed vigour at the organ, giving the soft introductory prelude that ushers in the overture with excellent judgment, though now and then (perhaps, however, the organ and its " mixtures," which " mix" ungratefully with the orchestra-not the organist-must be rated) a little too obstreperous in the full choruses.
The principal singers-Madame Rudersdorff, Miss Dolby, Signor rBeletti, Messrs. Montem Smith, Thomas, and Sims Reeves-performed their duties in a manner that calls for unqualified praise. Signor Belletti, who has made sensible progress in his pronunciation of the English language, gave the invariably solemn recitatives and airs of Eli in a highly artistic and expressive style throughout. Mfiss Dolby sang the morning and evening prayers-two of the most melodiously beautiful and graceful inspirationstu the oratoriowith a perfection of taste that elicited general admiration. Madame Rudersdorff was entirely successful in the joprano music of Hannah, more especially in the air " I will extol thee, 0 Lord," which she sang with a feeling and animation that brought down thunders of applause from the audience, The applause, indeed, was more frequent and unrestrained than we can remember at any previous concert of the Sacred Harmonio Society. When Mr. Sims Reeves had terminated his superbly energetic performance of " Philistines, hark, the trumpets sounding ! " it assumed the character of an uproar, and did not cease until the singer rose (after as much hesitation as was becoming) for the purpose of repeatis it, which he did with undiminished vigour.
Ithe audience could only be made to understand the strain on the physical forces which this extraordinary piece entails-be the lungs of the singer ever so much tougher than the lungs of ordinary moathey would be less unmerciful, and refrain from imposing upon him the very arduous task of going through the whole of it twice-au act of despotism which must be denounced as utterly selfish and inconsiderate. The second tenor part was carefully sustained by hlr. Montem Smith, and in that of the second bass Mfr. Thomas, who had little to sing but declamatory recitative, distinguished himself meet favourably. MEr. Costa, on entering and quitting the orchestra, was greeted enthusiastically.
Eli is to be repeated on Friday week.

Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MONBY-MA1RKET and CITYINTELLICEBCE.
Saturday Evening.
The financial statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was received this morning with satisfaction, and Consols opened at the final price of yesterday, but the Bank return was less favourable than had been anticipated, and the tendency to a continued pressure for money, coupled with a specalative sale of 200,0001. stock by a broker supposel to act for persons possessing French or Russian information, caused themarket to close with a heavy appearance. The first quotation for money was 93i to {, and for a short time there were buvers at 93t. There was then a reaction, and the last operations were at 93, to ..F for money, and 93Q to 94 for the 5th of March. The news from India, Persia, and China contained little to alter previous prospects, and it had no perceptible influence on prices. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 217k; Reduced, 93i to 94; New Three per Cents., 94i to i; Exchequer-bonds, 98& to a; India Stock, 218 to 220; India Bonds, is. discount to Is. premiumn; and Exchequerbills, Is. to 3s. premium.
In the Stock-Exchange to-day the rate for short loans on Government securities ranged between 5 and 6 per cent. In the discount-market and at the Bank there was a sustained demand at fuU terms.
Foreign stocks were generaUy weU supported, and a fair amount of business took place in the principal descriptions. Turkish Six per Cents. for the account were purchased at 94i, i, and 95; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, at I 01 and J. Bargains occurred in Venezuela, at 371; New Granada Active, 22i ; the Deferred, 6i; Mexican, for money, 22 ; and for the account, 22i; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 80; Portuguese Three per Cents., for money, 44; for the account, 44 ; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., small, 97; Spanish New Deferred, for account, 24h and ~ ; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 99 and 98k.
The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 50c. for money, and 68f. 55c. for the account, showing no alteration, except an increasein direct as compared with speculative purchases.
The late gold arrivals from Australia seem only for a moment to have checked the demand for gold for exportation. There was a withdrawal from the Bank to-day of 32,0001. On the other hand the receipt has been annolmced of 9B,1381.,-namely, 5,6381. by the Avon from the River Plate, 14,5001. from the Peninsula, and 75,0001. by the Persia from New York. The latter, however, is almost entirely for Paris.
The telegraphic accounts from India to-day present no variation in the rates of exchange at Bombay and Calcutta, except, perhaps, that the tone is a little less unfavourable. Under these ciroumstances, it is expected the next mail from this side wMl take out about 500,0001. From China the dates are to the 30th of December, being a fortnight later than those previously received. At Canton the exchange was 4s. 9d., showing no alteration beyond an advance of id. At Shanghai there had been a further decline of about 3i per cent., the quotation being 6s. 9d. The inducement to ship silver to that port is therefore considerably diminished. The exports of tea to date were 37,000,0001b., and of silk 29,200 bales. Transactions in siLk were limited, owing to the high prices. Purchases of tea continued at Foochow. The arrival of a commissioner from Pekin to arrange a settlement of the difficulty with England was expected in about five weeks; meanwhile Admiral Seymour was abstaining, as far as possible, from further operations pending the receipt of instructions from home. Despatches had lately arrived concerning a revision of the treaty, but it was believed they were of a nature rather to increase than to solve the existing perplexities.
The intimation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the duty on tea, which, under the act of 1855, was arranged to be reduced from Is. 9d. per lb. to Is. 2d. on the 1st of April next, and in the following year to is., is now to experience a diminution of only 2d. per annum during each of the next three years, and of 3d. in the following year, so as to delay its reduction to ls. per lb. until 1861, caused great excitement to-day among the houses interested. The analogous step with regard to sugar did not appear to create a great impression, but the stocks of tea are unusually large, and the market is proportionably sensitive. A public meeting of importers and dealers is therefore to be held on Monday. As the country had properly insisted upon the reduction of the income-tax, and the Chancellor was consequently compelled to keep his other resources as much as possible unimpaired, there does not seem any ground for complaint at the manner in which he has thus secured nearly a million that would otherwise have been lost to him, and hence the dissatisfaction of the trade must be rather with the way in which they have been taiken by surprise than with the policy of the measure itself. It was indispensable that the money should be raised from some quarter, and it is difficult to see a mode less likely to create disappointment to the people at large than that of dealing with an article already exposed from political causes to contingencies that may render a limitation of consumption desirable, and on which, moreover, there was no necessity to impose new burdens, but merely to diminish for a short time the extent of an approaching relief. With respect to the absence of any warning as to the intended change there is also little to be said, since in all matters involving the possibility of speculation a Government must be entitled to credit for keeping its plans entirely secret. The proposed opposition, therefore, would seem in every respect unreasonable but for the fact that the Government, in reply to questions addressed to them a month or two back, stated the 1st of April next to be the precise date at which the reduction to Is. 2d. would take place, without reminding the inquirers that this, like all other points of revenue or expenditure for the coming year, would be open to the reconsideration of Parliament. Even here, however, although it would undoubtedly have been well if the trade could have been prevented from falling into a hasty assumption, it is not clear that there is room for blame. When the answers in question were given the agitation against the income-tax had not approached its climax, and the Chancellor probably had calculated only in a partial degree on the surrender to be made; but, waiing that plea, he may urge that it was the duty of the Government to give only a literal answer to a literal question ; that any allusion, however slight, to the possibility oE modifications would have been liable to interested interpretation; and, finally, that it was not their business to remind commercial persons that every fiscal settlement must always be liable to disturbance, to meet any change in the annual requirements for the service of the State.
The tea-market to-day was without any decided change. The news from China was considered favourable for higher prices, but was counteracted by the announcement regarding the duty. In common congou transactions to the amount of about 5,000 chests took place at ls. Ojd.
The railway meet;ings of the week have presented some facts of interest, and have included those of the Great Western and South-Western Companies. The report of the Great Western has been adopted, and the dividend confirmed at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum; a ballot is, however, to be taken on the question raised with regard to management. The principal discussion was in relation to the proceed-
ings or the committee of eonsultation, and the regulation of the coal traffic. According to the report of the London and North-Western Company, the profits of the half-year exceed those of the corresponding period by 39,9631., and the directors are consequently enabled to recommend a dividend at the rate of 5Z. 10s. per cent. per annum. The directors of the North-EasternRailway recommend that dividends be declared on the Berwick stock and shares at the rate of 41 per cent. per annum, and on the York stock at 31per cent.per annum, leavingbalances of 11,0l51. and 4,2421. to be carried forward. The Leeds revenue acount shows an available balance of 14,5681. The dividend of the London and Blackwall Railway will be at the rate of 3e. 6d. per share, the amount for distribution standing at 19,3021. At theLondon And South-Western meeting the dividend at the rate of 61 per cent. per annum was carried, ind the report was agreed to. The points referred to in the course of the debate were the proposed introduction of the broad gauge from Salisbury to Southampton, the law charges, and the satisfactory development of general traffic. The dividend recommended by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway is at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum. At the meeting of the Rhymney Railway Company the report detailing progress was adopted, and it is statel that the construction of the works is beiag
expedited with all despatch. The agreement between the directors and the trustees of Lord Bute was sanctioned, and the former were authorized to borrow 30 0001. on debentures. The directors of the East ]ancashire Company propose to pay a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum. A majority of the shareholders of the Mliddlesborough and Guisborough Railway have empowered the board to lease the line to the Stockton and Darlington Company, or to make arrangements for an amalgamation, at a guaranteed dividend of G per cent. per annum for 1,000 years on a capital of 96,0001., with an optionl to purchase. The report of the Cork and Bandon Railway states that the directors are in a position to pay a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum for the half-year on the No. 1 preference shares, and. interest at the rate of 6 per cent, on the No. 2 preference capital, leaving a small balance to be carried forward. Progress has been made in liquidating the debts of the company, and the directors regret that the increase in traffic has not been more encouraging. The dividend of the Dublin and Droheda Company is proposed to be at the rate of i} per cent, per annum. At the Mid-Rent meeting the report was agreed to, and it is announced that the traffic since the opening has presented satisfactory results. The proposed extension to Croydon is approved by the shareholders. The report of the Sittingbourne and Sheerness Railway states that the works have been commenced, and an opinion is expressed that the original capital will be fuUy adequate to carry out the entire undertaking, including branches to Queenborough Point and the dockyard at Sheerness. The dividend of the Glocester and Dean Forest Railway at the rate of lls. Sd. per share has been declared, and the report adopted. The income for the half-year, including rent from the Great Western, amounted to 6,6341., and the balance applicable to dividend, after the payment of expenses, was 6,0751. The report of the *Vhitehaven, Gleator, and Egremont Company shows a dividend at the rate of nearly 9 per cent. per annum.
Accounts from St. Petersburg to-day mention the publication of the ukase for the Ru3sian railway scheme. It agrees with the partioulars already given the only new feature being a line to the Prussian frontier atEonigsberg. The capital is to be equal to 45 millions sterling in 201. share3, the whole to be expended in ten years. The amount of the first issue is fixed at 12 millions.
The arrival of the India and China mail at Marseilles was announced in the course of the day, and the letters are expected to be delivered on Monday mornimn.
The Emigration Commissioners have advertised for vessels to carry emigrants to Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, to be ready for passengers between the 31st of March and the 7th of April.
The annexed information relative to the progress of English mining adventure is condensed from the Mining Xour2ml:-

With regard to foreign mining the following is the only paragraph worthy of extract:-
" The St. John del Ray Mining Company have received advices from Brazil by the Avon, showng the produce of gold in the month of November to be 26,588 oitavas, from 7,217 tons of stone stamped, yielding a profit of 2,5971. The ChancellorsviDe Freehold Gold Co mpany have further adviees from their superintendent. He writes:' Ihave placed all the force on the old workings on the sonth vein.

Coptsin Dixon U.N., Captain Farrer, H.C.S., Mx. Andrew Johnson, aond' Mr. W. Gaussen. The secetary presented the accunts, by which it appeared the average daily number of boa-rders durIng 1856 was 221; the total amount paid for board being 30,262 lOs. l0d. During the same period 40,363 12s. Ild. was remitted to the friends of sailors living in the country; and since the establishment in October last of the Semanlas' Savings Bank, under the management of the Board of Trade, 2,5644 4s. has been deposited therein. The instituttion contains beds for the accomrmodation of upwards of 300 boarders, and on several occasions within the last 12 nionths tbe whole of these have been occupied, so thst a great many sailors were unable to obtain admission. This would almost seem to justify the conclusion that another Sailors' Home in the neighbourhood would find a field of usefulness. With regard to the Destitute Sailors' Asylum, the secretary's repr showed also a large increase in the number of inniates; the averae daly nuLmber relieved during last month being 72; and the total ntimber for the year 185 1,453. A large proportion of these men arrive at the asylum in a weak state of health, and ani of them in a destitute condition.

Divorce And Testamentary Jurisdiction.-
DIVORCE AND T AzNTARy JuRISDI{ION.. The Lord ChanceUor's biUs on wils and divorce cases have been printed. Their purport will have been gathered fronm a perusal of the recent debate in the House of Lords The testamentary jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Court the Prerogative Court) is abolished, and the " Court of Probate" eEtablished to exercise the jurisdiction instead, to have the same powers throughout England as the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. One of the Vice-Chancellors will be made judge of the new court, and any other of the equity 'udgee may supply his place in case of absence An appeal will li
to the Court of Appeal in Chancery, and thence (or immediately, without so appealing) to the House of Lord fro
all orTers or decrees of the Court of Probate In the Court of Probate the rules of evidence in common law courts are to be observed, and issues may be directed to common law courts. The second measure, the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill, abolshes theexingjursdiction of theEecledasticalCourts,andestablishesa"Courtof MIrriageandDivoroe," so called. The judges of this court will include the Lord Chancellor, the Chief Judges of the three Common Law Courts, and the Dean of the Arches, three to be a quoram. The Dean of the Arches (who must always be present) will be called the "Judge Ordinary" of the Court, and have full authority to hear and determine all matters, except petitions for dissolving a marriage. The new Court is required to act on the "principles" of the old Ecclesastical Courts. A wife whose husband has deserted her for the space of two years may obtain a divorce B men89 et thoro, and in such cases alimony will be Awar4 to the bereft lady. Husbands and wives who cannot

The wife thus divorced wiU be considered, as to propery, u fme sole. Of course the parties may hereafter cohabit, but no suit may be preferred for restitution of conjugal rights. If the wife commit adultery, or the husband commit incest, bigamy, or adultery, with cruelty, a petition for dissolving the union may be presented to the Court, and the Court, if satisfied, may ,sssolve the marriage; hat in this cas, also alimeny may be ordered for the wife at the discertion of the Court. When the time allowed for appeal expires the parties will be free to marry agai, as if the prior marriage had been dissolved by death. An ppeal will lie to the House of Lords from the decision of the new Court,

The report of the directors of this company states thak the accounts for the half-year ending the h1st of December last again show an improvement in the traffic receipts, with baet a relatively smiall increase in working expenses. The receipts amounted to 932,82M1., against. 903,897T at the corresl,onding period of 1855, showing an increase of 29,4324, or o 26 per cent. The expenditure amounted to 455,7711., against 450,1001., including in both cases 26,2001. rates, taxes, and Government duty, and 55,0001. for renewal of 1he permanent way, showing an increase of 5,6711., leaving ,he net receipts 477,0571. against 453,2961., and the increase of 23,7611. in the net receipts as compared with the corresponding period of 1855. The permanent way and works hiave been properly maintained, and a considerable amonr,t expended on renewals. The rolling stock has likewise been kept in a thoroughly efficient and improvine condition. The disposable balances on the Berwick and 1vork revenue accounts, after paying all preferential charges, amount to 265,SE351. and 64,5931. respectively, and the directors recomnmend that dividends be declared on the Berwick stock and shares at the rate of 4i per cent. per annum, and on the York stock at the rate of 31 per cent. per annum, leaving balances of 11,0511. and 4,2421. for the next account. The Leeds revenue account shows an available balance of 14,5681. after paying the dividends uipon all classes of preference shares, which will enable the directors to discharge the wbole of the remaining arrears of dividend, amounting to 14,341t. on the preferential stock of that sec. tion, and leave a balance of 2271. to the next account, Heavy coke trains having passed over the Bishop Auckland biranch daily for some weeks past with perfect safety, the directors are satisfied that there is no necessity for further delay, and the sanction of the Board of Trade for its immediate opening has therefore been asked. The directors have made application to Parliament for power to construct a bran. h up the Lanchester Valley in connexion with the Biop Auckland branch, 13 miles in length, the estimated cost of which is 120,0001. It will pass through a valuable coalfield, at present wholly unworked, termmating at the extensive works of the Conside Iron Company. Also a bil to amalgamate the Hartlepool Dock and Railway Company with the North-Eastern Company. The Hartlepool shareholders are to continue to receive their fiKed dividend of 8 per cent. per annum until the expiration of the 31 years' lease on the 1st of July, 1879, and from that date they will become proprietors of an equal amount of ordinary Berwick stock, and take dividend accordingly. The other bil relates to the cancelling of certain shares which the Berwick, York, and Leeds companies previous to amalgamation had power to create, which either remainad unissued or had been forfeited, and to create in their stead a similar amount of North-Eastern shares or stock. The directors state that the result of a thorough examination of the stock and share departments has been to satisfy them that the whole of these offices are in a sound and satisfactory state. The capital account shows that 14,259,5351. had been received on shares, and 6,645,8911. on loans; total, 20,905,4261. The amount expended on the Berwick capital account was 11,357,9901. ; on York account, .1,868,5221.; on the Leeds capital account, 2,657,6911. ; on the malton capital account, 320,6261. ; and on thejoint capitalaccount, 882,8561.; total 21,087,6851., leavingabalance against the comnpany'of 382,2591. The revenue account for the half-3 ear ending December 31 shows that 932,8281. had been received, and 455,7711. expended, leaving a balance of 477,0571., out of which 272,3391., or 571 per cent., is allotted to the Berwick shareholders, 156,9511., or 32-9 per cent,, to the York sbareholders, and 47,7051., or 10 per cent., to the leeds shareholders.
NORTHERN AND EASTERN.
At the half-yearly meeting of this company, held on Thursday, at the Bishopsgate station, A[r. Pat^rinn in the chair, the umal dividends on the 5 per cent, and 6 per cent. guaranteed shares were declared for the half-year ending the S1st of December last, payable on the 25th inst.
ROYSTON AND HITCHfT.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Thursday at the office, St. Helen's-place; Mr. W. Reed in the chair.
On the motion of the CURnIM.tN a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per anlnum was declared on the consolidated stock of the company, less lAd. per share of G1. 5s. each for the expenses of management.
Sir g. W. CAiDZaN said that the expenses of management cost them between 5001. and 6001., which he thought was too much, considering that they had merely to receive the guaranteed dividend from the Great Northern Company, and to issue dividend warrants to the shareholders. He believed that an agreement could at one time have been made vwith the Great Northern Company, and could no doubt still be made with them, to take the entire management of their affairs for about 2001. per annum, and in lieu of their existing stock to give them a guaranteed stock in the Great Norther. Company. By iseans of such an arrangesient they would save about two-tlhirds of the present cost of management, and raise the value of their shares in the market fully 10 per cent. He proposed that a committee should be appointed to confer with the directors on the subject.
Soine of the shareholders having expressed their approval of the proposition,
The CtAIMsIiAN said they would require an act of Parliament to enable them to relinquish their staff, and place the management of their affairs in the hands of the Great Northern Company. He was opposed to the proposed arrangement, particularly as several of the present shareholders had invested their money, relying upon the integrity of the present management. So far fronm the proposed arrangement raising the value of the shares in the market he thought it would have the effect of depressing them. By such an arranggment they would be placed in a similar position to that of the East Lincolnashire Railway, which. he believed, had lost some thousands by forgery of transfers. He was supported in his views on that subject by the whole board, and he thought that no advantage would arLie from the change.
After somie discussion Sir R. CARDEN withdrew his motion, stating that he would take the necessary steps for convening, by requisition, a special meeting to consider the proposition.
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairulan.
SALISBURY AND YEOVIL.
The report of the directors of this company states that the Exeter Extension Act was passed in July, 1856, soon after which the South-Western Company commenced operations at( Crewkerne. HIoniton, and other places on their line. The arrangements for working the Yeovil Railway by the South-Western Company have niot yet been filnally concluded, hut both companiies have agreed to leave the question of difference to the decision of Captain Huish. Havieg been advised by their engineer that a modification of the line at Sherborne, as projected in 1846, would, in many
espects, prove advantageous to the company, anid having ascertained that no opposition would now be offered to it, they wilL, with the sanction of the shareholders, proceed wvitl thlat portion of the bill, as well as with that relating to the fixing the course of the line and the site of the station at Salisbury. The earlier or later period of opening the line will much depend upon receiving facilities from the landowners throughout, and the directors anticipate the cordial cu-operation of all in endeavouring to secure to the district as soon as possible the benefits of railway communication.
The renort of Mr. .T, Locke, the engineer, states that at all ppints where pos.ession of land has been obtained the cuttings have been comLuenced, and about 120,000 cubic yards of earthwork between Wilton and Gilliugharn have been removei. Land is required in various places, and the contractors are now prepared to proceed wherever it can be furnished to thieni,
The capital account shows that 62,0651. had been received and 32,8f11. expended, leaving a balance of 29,2031. The co-hiany is authorizedIto raise 400,0001. on shares, of which the London and South-Western are to subscribe 100,0001., and to borrow 133,3331.
BRADFORD, WAKEFIELD, AND LEEDS.
The half-yearly meeting of this company -was held on lriday at Bradford, blr W. Firth in the chair.
The Secretary baving read the report,
The OssolAx stated that the total receipts on capital accrunt up to the 31st of December last were 143,5541.
the expenditure %as 142,1471., and the balauaei in banker's hands 1,4:(71. The item of calls in arrear at that time was 7,176&. Since then, however, 3,8791. had been received, so that the arrears no- anmounted to 3,z981., and he believed they would speedily come into the hands of the company. The loans taken up on their borrowving powers were 49,6501. according to the report, but they now ainounted to within 3,31 (i. ot tihe full sum- G0,0001.-they were enabled to bolrow, and the item of 5,8871. prepayments of call addtd to these swmis had enabled the directors to carry on the works of the comupany during the past year 'wli, vigour. The expenditure had necessarily been large. a.n the directors had passed a resolution nmaking a ra of 21. 10s. per shinre, wvhich they thought would carry then: on untkl the line was opened. The contractor had stated that by the 1iG of June he would hand over the line to tLe directors ready for opening. Arrangements had been iriade with the Greoat Northern and the Lancashire and Yorbshire cowlpanies for working it, and with the Leeds, Bradford, and Halifax Junction company for using a certain poirtion of their line. He concluded by moving tile adoption of the report.
hlr. G. AN DEWFON seconded the motion.
TL0 CIIAemrylAN, iii reply to a question, said that the original tine tixed f.,r the opening of the line was the lst of April next, and therefore it would only be delayed two months.
The report was unanimously adopted Eight directors and two auditors were elected. It was arranged that the general meetings in future should be held quarterly, and a vote of tlanks to the chairman and directors terminated tho proceedings.
MANCHESTER, SIIEFFIELD, AND LINCOLNSHIRE.
The Barnbley and Penistone branch of this conipany was opened on Thursday ior traffic. ANlthough the branch is only eight nudes long it is a very important link in the main line of conimunication, s it shortens the distance to Manchester by seine 30 miles, and so strongly was it opposed that the PSarliamentary expenses incurred in obtaining the bill amounted to 80,0001. The works on the line were heavy, in consequence of its taking a direction through the large hills known eathe backbone of nland. At about 12 o'olock a speal truin from Manchester conveying a number of the airectors, arrived at the Barnsley station, which was gaily decorated, as were also several intermediate places on the line. The directors and their guests dined together in a large marquee, Mr. T. X. Barker, of Sheffield, in the chair. The csual hopeful and comnplimentary speeches wrere delivered, and it was stated by a director of the An°nlo.French
SkuComp~any that they wrould in all probability bce large cusonnrs orBarneley coal, of which they bad already taken from 70,000 to 80,000 tons to France.
SOUTH YORKSHIE.
The report of the directors of this company states that the gro6s revenue earned in conmexion with the railway and eaai during the balf-year amounted to 68,5901., tand the total expenditure to 28,9521., leaving a net balance of 39,6381., vhich added to 1001., the balance from last half-
year, gives a total of 39,7391. available for interest and dividend. The charges for interest on debentures and nrortgage debts amount to 16,9271,, and the fixed rents to 4,741!., saking a total charge of 21,6681., leaving 18,070l. for dividend, which, after paying that on the guaranteed shares, v ould yield a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on the ordinary shares, leaving a balance of 7121. The gross revenue receipts for the half-year (68,5901.) exhibit an increase of 10,7771., or 18 6 per cent., over those of the corresponding period of 1855, and have been earned at a total expense of 28,9521., or 42 5 per cent. on the receipts, being 53-2 per cent. on therailway, and26*8 per cent. on the navigations, -which respectively includes aU the charges incurred during the past half year. The coal traffic by railway exhibits an increase of 7,0911. as compared with the corresponding period of 1855, although the rates obtained have been on a reduced scale to meet the competition in the var ous markets. The quantity of coals carried wvithin the same poriod has been 418,639 tons, against 270,485 tons, showing an increase of 148,154 tons or 54-4 per cent. The investment on the part of the company in vessels for the export trade from Grimeby was limited to 25,0001., and had yielded for the past half-year 6 per cent., with a considerable reserve, amounting to rearly an equal percentage, wbile the tolls derived from the coals exported were an additional profit, and yielded in the last balf -year a gross return of 2,1821. Only five out of the nine steamers are at present at -work, but in the course of the present half-year the whole will be available; and, even assuming that the exports were limited to 100,000 tons annuaUy, it would bring exclusive of the dividend upon the 25,000!. sub. seribed to the capital, a gross return of nearly 7,0001. The satisfaction expressed in France at the quality of the coals was great, and their character as a steam coal may bh considered as established in that country. The company has been called upon to pay the Dearne and Dove Canal purcbase money of 210,0001., fixed by the original act to be liquidated on the 2d of January last. Instead of adding the whole of that amount to the debenture debt of the company,the directors propose to caU up the unpaid capital, amounting to 186,7551., and this step wil enable them to convert the company's shares into stock. 'The capital account shows that 2,293,1051. had been received, and 2,258,5101. expended, leaving a balance of 34,595!. The revenue account of the railway ahowed that 39,6861. had been received during the half-year, and 21,2031. expended leaving a balance of 18,482!. The receipts from the navigations amounted to 28,9041., and the expenses to 7,7481., leaving a net profit of 21,1561.
MARYPORT AND CARLISLE.
The report of the directors of this company states that the receipts for the half-year ending the 31st of December last amounted to 27,5001., and for the corresponding period of 1855 to 26,6511., showing an increase of 8491. The expenditure for the half-year aumounted to 11,9661., and for the co responding period of 1855 to 13,1141., showing a decrease of 1,1481. During the past half-year a caving has been effected in the consumption of coke, and the general expenditure has been reduced. The rolling stock has been maintained in an efficient state. The relaying of the permanent way has been proceeded with, and the doubling of the line commenced. The balance for the half-year, after carying 3,5081. to the credit of the renewal fund, amounts to 8,9131. The directors recommend a dividend, at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, upon aU shares, both original and preferential, to be paid on the 6th of March, subject to income-tax. The report of Mr. Dees, the engineer, states that upwards of 141 miles of single lIe have ben relaid with heavy rails, an 14 miles of the line between Aspatria end Leegate has been doubled; the continuation of the doubling of the line up to Leegate, a distance of three miles, wiiU shortly be completed. Preparations are being made to relay five miles more in the next half-year. The capital account to the 31st of December showed that 476,6621. had been received and 501,7231. expended, leaving a balance against the company of 25,0611.
EDINBURGH AND BATHGATE.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Edinburgh on Friday, Major Shairp presiding.
The report stated that the balance found due to the contractor under the UphaU contract submission had been consigned in bank in terms of the arbiter's award. The contractor had since raised an action of reduction of the decreets arbitral pronounced in the submissions, which action the directors considered groundless, and had given instructions for its being defended and brought to as speedy a termination as possible. As a portion of the debenture debt would be due at Whitsunday, the directors were now advertising for loans to replace the amount, which, from the undoubted nature of the security, they expected to effect on favourable terms. The directors recommended a dividend for the half-year at the rate of 4s. 9d. per share.
The report was adopted, after some explanations, stating that there bad been a reduction in the dividend since last half-year of 9d. per share owing to the higher rates of interest now paid on the company's debenture stock. The rate of interest paid by the company had within a short time increased from 34 to 5 per cent.; but the directors intimated their expectation that they vwould negotiate the new loan on more favourable terms than they at present en).ioyed.
The dividend was declared in terms of the report, and the meeting separated.
For sometime SOUTa WALES.
For some time past the company and the trustees of the late Lord Ailford have disputed the value of 17 or 18 acres of land at the terminus of the company's line at Neyland or Milford Haven. The trustees estimated it at 50,0001., but the railway company refused that sum, and the question was submitted to arbitration which has just been decided in awarding compensation at 9,060l.
ULSTEIL
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Wednesday at Belfast; Mr. W. Coates in the chair.
Mr. BROrITTONao the secretary and general manager, read the report, an abstract of which has appeared in !lVe Times.
The CIIAIRsAsN stated that the share registers had been strictly examined, and found to be perfectly correct. He then moved a formal resolution for the adoption of the report and the declaration of a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, less income-tax, payable on the 18th inst., which was seconded.
A long discussion ensued, in which Captain Gray, Mr. C. A. Stewart, Mr. Smyth, Mr. Patterson, and Mr. Allen took part, in the course of which it was stated that the original share capital of the company was 600,0001., and the borrowing power 200,0001.; they had subscribed 20,0001. to the Portadown extension line, and still, after many years. they had not yet raised the whole of their share capital, bat they had exercised their borrowing powers, and had a floating debt of 36,0001., which it was intended to pay off.
The motion was carried unanimously.
Dr. LYr?q was sorry to observe that the direetors had stated in their report that they would give every opposition in their power to the projected Newry and Armagh Railway.
The CHAIRMAN said the proposed line was only a few miles shorter than the existing line, and they could take the people to Aniagh at a cheaper rate than they could reach it by the proposed line.
On the motion of the CHAirXAAN, a resolution authorizing the directors to borrow 50,0001. for the extension line was carried.
A discussion of considerable length eiisued, in reference to the Belfast and W est of Ireland scheme, in the course ofbwih
Mr. MORELL proposed a resolution to the effect that tbhematter he left in the hands of the directors.
Captain GRAY moved an amendment, to the effect that +he directors be requested to take such steps as they may be advised for the recovery of the balance due by the Belfast and West of Ireland Company.
On a shoxv of hands the amendment was lost, and the motioni proposed by Mr. Morell was carried by a large majority.
A vote of thanks to the chairman, directors, and general manager concluded the proceedings.
MADRAS.
The report of the directors of this company states that the first section of 65 miles of the South-West line from Madras to Arcot was opened for traffic on the 1st of July last, and has been since at work uninterruptedly. A further opening of the line will take place in April to Vellore, a distance of about 82 miles from Madras; and by the lst of October next it is expected to be opened as far as Goriattam, 15 miles further. By the middle of next year the board are led to hope that the railway will be conipleted to Salem from Madras, and by the end of the year to the Mlalabarcoast, a distance of 450 miles. The system on which the construction of the railway is carried on, Nyith. out the intervention of contractors, has continued to work satisfactorily under the able direction and charge of the ehief engineer and his assistants. The first three districts, coinprisiDg a length of 72 miles from Madras, are now so far comipleted as to adniit of a close estimate being formed of their cost. The line is here laid with rails of S41b. to the yard, a siiigle line, but with bridges for a second line of rails; the earthwork for the first 25 miles is also constructed for a double line. There are in this section two handsome granite bridges of 56 and 26 arches respectively. The amount of earthwork may be below the average of the line generally. The entire cost, including stations, a due proportion of the charges of superintendence, of Indian and English management, of the cost of the Aadras terminal station and workshops,- tele-
graph, and maintenance of way for one year, but exclusive of rolling stock, may safely be taken at 6,0001. per mile. The first 65 nihles of this section of the line have, as before stated, been in work since the 1st of July last. The traffic returns received to the end of November give the followving results for the five months:-Receipts, by coaching, 59,619r., bv goods 45.128r., total 104,797r. ; working expences,
5.5 COr., or 52 96 per cent. ; balance 49,297r. The receipts from passengers have remained nearly stationary, owing to the development of this branch of traffic being impeded by the want of due accommodation and facilities being given
to the public in the times and number of trains, and the want of roads to the stations from the towns and highways of the coantry. These causes being now, however, in course of removal, the directors expect soon to hear of a considerable extension of the passenger traffic. While the goods traffic had already reached a rate of upwards of 50,000 tons per annum, the railway up to that time had neither obtained a large amount of the traffic comingfrom Salem and other districts to the westward, nor almost any part of the extensive trade in salt from Madras to the interior. The tTaffic manager's staff is reported as efficiently and economically organised, and the hoard lcok with confidence to the development of the
traffic under improved arrangements, The capital account to he31s o Deemershos hat2,130511. ha been received, including 104,284 intehrestt 2from .the Ead Inaia Compny, nd 1342,601 expnded incudig 104,524!. interest paid tlotheshoareheoldenrs,leaving abalance of

The report of thudretrsothscm nytatecha
lies were anrveyed and levelled from Kurcee to Bydes!ah, the plans and sectiona of which reached the bar in August last; but it appeared to be thought neces-
sary by the local authorities in India to cause still farther surveys of alternate lines to be prosecuted-from Kurraches to the Indus, in the vicinity of Hyderabad--with the view of arriving at a terminal point by a route which shoLuld present the greatest amount of commercial advantage and the fowest difficulties of construCtion, and also with a view to the future extension of the railway. The directors fally entertained the expectation of being able to report to the proprietors at the meeting on the 18th inst. the decision of the Government of Bombay as to the direction of the line. Ilniiediately upon receipt of official intelligence of this fact, no time will be lost in taking the requisite steps to insure the speedy conimencement of the works. Thirty miles of permanent way material have been already shipped, a large portion of which has arrived in safety at its destination, and the despatch of a further like quantity is now in progress. Application has been nade to the authorities for sue co-operation and assistance as would enable this company to place a fdotilla of steamers of improved construction on the Indus, so as to connect the railway from Kurrachee to Hyderabad with the one from Mooltan to Lahore and Umritsir. Besides wool, wheat, linseed, and other commodities, cotton of excellent quality is produced on the banks of the rivers of the Punjab, and will, doubtless, be largely exported as soon as the necessary facilities have been provided for conveyance to the port of shipment. Since their last report the directors bave deemed it advisable to form a company under the title of " the Panjab Railway Conupany," the prospectus of which was issued and the shares apportioned in the early part of last mouth.
The capital account of the Scinde Railway shows that 332,441L. had been Ireceived, including 13,3651. on account of interest, and 112,6701. expended, including 13,3651. interest paid to proprietors, leaving a balance of 219,7711.
THE LONDON NECROPOLIS AiND NATIONAL
MAUSOLEUM COMPANY.
The annual general meetlng of this companywas held on Saturday at the station ian Westminster-bridge-road, at which Mfr. T. Dalin presided. The company has its cemetery at Woking, consisting of 400 acres of enclosed land, easy of access fronn the South-Western Railway. The directors, in their report, state the number of shares to be 14,936, the calls on which have all been paid except on 20, whieh the meeting declared to be forfeited, subject to the power of the directors to restore them on due application by the holder. The total amount of capital is 17 ,1521. ls. 4d., but this has been somewhat increased since making up the account. The total expenditure on capitalaccountis 1.55, 3021.3s.1d. The liabilities ofthecompany at the present time for money borrowed and debts contracted amount to 17,3991. 2s. Against this there are assets amounting to 6,2941. 17s. 6d., leaving a clear balance against tbe company of 11,1041. 5s. 6d. The company has expended 8,7931. Is. 7d., part of that 4alance, in the purchase of land, nuder the powers given them by the act of 1855. The number of acres so purchased is 1,800; and the directors have obtaned the certificate of the Board of Trade, empowering them to sell about 1,200 of those acres, being surplus land not required for cemetery purposes, and from the sale of which they expect to denve a considerable profit. The receipts from funerals in 1856 amounted to 3,6771., being an increase of 19 per cent. on the receipts in 1855. The interments ia 185n6 were 2,426, showing an increase of 25 per cent. over those in 1855. The directors complain of the apathy shown on the part of the Government in enforcing the provisions of the Metropolis Burial Act for suppressing the abuses of the old system urued in many ox the metropolitan ceme. teries; but the Under Secretary of the Home Deprtuent has intimated to them that it is his intention during the present session to introduce an amended bill which w;.11 effectually put an end to the practices complained of. If that intention should be carried out, and those wholesonme estraints which are maintained by this company in their cemeteryshould be imposed upon other cemeteries, the dimotors anticipate that the balance-sheet, instead of showin- a deficit, will in future years present a considerable profit, and that the shareholders might then reasonably expect a dividend, for which they have hitherto looked in vain. MIr. W. F. A. Delane and Mxr. H. Wilidnson. twoof the retiring directors by rotation, were re.elected. Mr. roll,h t t.ird retiring director, at his own request, was not reap; . -i

The Yorkshire Press And The Law Of Libel.-
THE YOR1;SrIstE PRESS ANTD THE LAw OF LiBEL.- The proprietors of several of the newspapers Published in the county of York have transmitted the following petition to Parliament:-
"That they bave seen with surprise and alarm the decision of the Court of Queen'e Bench in the case of 'Davison v. Duncn,' which was heard on dermurrer in that court in Hilary Term nVow last past and In which it was laid down that the pubhlication in a newspaper ol a report of the proceedings at a public meeting would form the ground of sn action for libel against tho publsher of such newspapea, and that she fact that such report was jit, true, faithful, correct, and accurate. and had been printed and Dublished without malico. con-
Dtituted no defene in pomnt of law. That while Your Dpetitionera do not . uestion the correctniess in point of law of the decision of the Court in 'pDavison v. Duncan,' they submit that an alteration of that 1hw is imperatively called for, both in the intereste of the publio and of the publibhera of newspapers, That it appears to your petitioners that the public have a right to expect at their hanidr, as publishers of a newspaper, accurate reports of public meetings in which they may feel deeply interested, but which they have not been able personaUy to attend, and that any law which tends to abridge that right must operate injuriously upon the whole community, by suppressing informatUon on political and soctal matters. That the
"ublishers of newspapers must, under the present Etate of the faw either altogether forego the publication of the proceedings of pub c meetings, or must. in determiuing upon what matter may be
ibellous and excludin it from their columns, exercise an amount of lega knowledge whlc loew of themn possess, besides undergoing an immense and in the vast majority of casges an Irmpradctlable amount of labour in personally cerusing and expurgating all reports of suich meetings. That while yoptr petitioners fully admit the sacrednes of private chater. Geradits right tothe fullest protnotion, so far as may be compatible with the pubinterest, they submit that the remedy of a person whose character or conduct miay be attacked at a public meeting ought to be limited to the utterr of the offensive words, and ought not to be extended to the innocent publisher of the nespaper in wnhich they may afterwards be reported Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your hon.

TaE CONVALE-S3CENlCE OF GEORGE HoL:tyot .e The friends of Mr. George Holmes wil be tified to learn thabt the bealth of that interesting maoefactor is perfectly restored ; and that in all respects he is quito as well as might be expected. It is impossible that we could have any more convincing proof of the mingled justice anud humanity of the step which sent out George Holmes to breathe the fresh air of his native district. Already we erceive what a weonderful obange for the bettor has taken
lace in George's health, He who a fer months ago was hclared to bo in a dying state from disesed r ver and lungs is now, thanks to the humane consideration of his custodians, in E perfect health." As yet, however, the late invalid has given but insufficient evidence of his convalescence; and we are inclinedto believe that the tender anxiety of ther nedical authorities have led them to exaggerate the favourable syynptoms of the case. The stealing of fowls, is, indeea, a low walk of art, and scarcely worthy of George HolmeS when in the fullvigourof manhood. ButCwe iavenotdoubt his genius will vindicate itself by-and-by-e. We must re-
tember, as some sort of extenuation for the paltry nature of the offences of which Holmes has been guilty since his liberation, that the change of ait has scarcely had time to produce its full efAects, We trust the magistrates of Bradford will interpose no obstacle in the way of a thorough
ca-rrying out of Sir Geor're Grey's pleasing experiment. A little more fresh air and liberty are yet required to bring the liver and lungs of Heolmes to their normal condition, and their ful m turdering pitch, And until the health of
tolmes is perfectly restored we insist upon no attempts L~eing made to deprive him of liberty. It particularly concens the viting magistrates and the surgeon of York Castle to take care that no one meddles with their iroteg6 as log as there is any reason to beliave that hi-, biliry and respiratory organs are in the slightet degreo af fected.-Yionhshoiveence.
OLIFFORDT'S INVENTION For, LOwERING BOATS AT SKt.-Tbe sbipowners and seamen on the east coast of Scot. land have taken up the subject of Clifford's invention for lowering boats at sea and held meetings at the principal
ceaports to petition Parliament to make itS u ompuso

STATE OF TRADE.
MANCHESTEP, FEB. 14.
There has been a moderate increase of bn.iness in yarns, and a little more doing in cloth; but in the latter sales have st been of inconsiderable extent. Longeloths and T cloths have met with a rather bettr marketfor the Mediterranean ; but the sales have been principally for that quarter. Printing cloths have sold rather better ; bat the improvement hsbeen too alight to give a stimulus to prices. The longcontinued declinie in 40-inch shirtings for India and China has caused rather more attention to be directed to them, and 36-inch shirtings are also in a little brisker demand.

BIRMINGHAM, Fzss. 14.
There is no material change reported in the state of the
iron trade. The dehnde for merchant iron of all descriptions improves, and prices of best mine pigs are weU maintamed.
The recent advances which have taken place in the prices of tin have moat injuriously affected the tin ware manufactnre of Birminghara and Wolverhampton- Works £which were recently busily employed working overtime are now but moderately engaged during the day - and a further advance of 4s. per cwt. upon common and 2s. per cwt. upon refined tin whi-ch was announced in the early part of the week is likely to cause a still further depression of this
iprtant branch of local moanufacture.
The principal brasafounders continue to be fnllyemployed in executing orders received bore the recentrise incopper; but this rise has completely uSettled the market, and very few homne orders have ince been received.
The demand from abroad is steady. and promses to improve. There is still great difficulty in procuring the necessary supply of copper. The smelters, finding a ready Wae in other marikets at improved rates, have for the last three months Tery sca entily lied this town, which usually consumes about one-thr of the total productiona. The deficiency has been made up out of the stock in hnprd, whih is now nearly exhausted. Several of the lamge con SurC s, ioxnseuec of their inability to procure material, have aee ompepulltedd to work short time.
The ironfoEders of the neighbourhood are generally in fair work, but the partial sspension of the London Works at Smethwick has thrown a gloom over that neighbourhoosl Great hopes were entertained that the works would have been arined on under the deed of inspection prepared in November, but the appearance of the names of Sir Charles Fox and Mr. Henderson in the laress on Friday night has at once put an end to all such illusory expectations. For some timne ast the works have been kept on for the completion of old contracts, and on Thursday Mr. Commissoner Balguy gave permission to pure the bme course, with a view to benefit the estate. These contracts will, however, be speedily completed, and then these extenesive works wiul be entirey closed. At one period about 1.400 hands were employed upon the premise, and these, to gether with out-workers engaged in their own shops in the neighbourhood, maude a aggregate of upwards of 2,O00operatives employed by the firmf. Fortunately-,the resent partial revival of trade has, however, caused the failure of goessrs Fox and Henderson to be less severely felt in the neighbourhoodl than it otherwise would have been.
The chain manufacturers in the neighbourhood of Cradfley and Stourbridge are busier thlau they have been for some time past, and the men engagec in one or two large establishm.ents t have struck for an advance of wages.
The annual meeting of the Dudlcy and Westbromwich Ban'king Company lha been held. A dividend of 5as. per share, or at the rate of 10 per cent, upono the amount aetually paid up, was declared.NOT GEA,FB14
A good deal of business Is daily being done in the laco
branchles, though there is no excessive demaand for any particule class of goods, coare plain nets excepted, or from any particular quarter. The concurrent and general operatioms kf the various classes of buyers kedet al hands active. Tha. ;erinr,a continue to make selections, as also do the CniU skdi- sha. Homne buyers arc purchasing a lttle, and good o eres continue to arrive from the United States. The
mtity of lace goods now annually shipped to America is Tr inus. Next week ig expected to be a usy one for the co,ne market, especialy if the existing fine weather should continue. The home houses are low in stock, and, as no marked change in fashion seems likely to require clases of goods different to those recently in demand, and as prices are rising, and must rise higher still, no doubt they wi lay in stock as heavily as they ca be supplied at existing rates. The ening of the budget has crea a favourable fooling. The reiin of so large a proportion of the income-tax muast give a great stinulus to the home trade.
There is a continued goode demand for every description of cotton hosiery, and framework-knitted goods generall; hut the high rates of raw cotton in Liverpool have again gnse an upward tendency to the prices of yarns in tios market. Spinners are requiring full rates, and in some instances a further avance. Manufactutrers, therefore, are perfeetly easy about selling the little stocks they have remainin on hand, as they have scarcely any yarns purchased at otual prices, and the advances which will be re-
~irdupon goods maade of yarns bought now will be somethigfearf uL In fact, all, classes of framnework-knitted goods, whether in cotton, wool, spum sik, or thrown se ,
mnust at once be advanced from 10 to 20 per cent, in price, or manufacturers wil be compelled toatp their machinery How far this wil affect future prospects it is difficult to foresee. At present stocks are unprececentedly light, and the wholesale hoyses in London and Manchester have not laid in to their usual extent, in the hope that goods would be lower. Their anticipations, however, are reversed, and now their selections cal only be had at fully advanced rates.
LEtCESTEa, FEnB. 14.
The hosiery trade continues fiat, manufacturers for the most art working to order. In goods of a fancy descrip tiona mtere is a fair amonnt of business; the sok thrau
seo is tolerably active. Worswte yarns are extremely dear, and spinners do not press the material into the market. Wools are higher, and it is expected they will soon reach 6Ss. per tod for farmers' lots. LED,FB14
The cloth-markets have been active, buyers operating freywhere they could mieet with goods to suit them. The stock, however, are very low in tho cloth-halls and in the hands of the manufacturers, and prices are advancing. Inthe prent state of the tradewith regard to wool manufascurers are moving cautiously ; and while they will not selltheir present products at quite sotlow rates as they woulcdhave done a month ago, they do not appear willing to give any material advance on the current rates for wool. A few of the smaler manufacturers in this district are curtaiing their productive powers, as they find it almost impossibloe, with the continually advancing state of the raw material, to secure adequate remuneration. Both wool and cottoniare now extensively used in the West Riding, and any change incthe price of either is felt in the seats of both the woollen and the worsted manufacture.
The great budk of the manufacturin operatives in Leeds and the surrounding district are wei employed, and the samenmy bei said of the artisan clmses.tin the locomotive ei e traded the depression which prevailed towards the close of the year has to some extent given way, and since Christmas there has been a decided improvement. Soae orders have been given out, but, the "shren'being previously very slack, there has been a good deal of "cutting, " and many of the orders have been taken at a low figure.
BRADFORD, FEB. 14.
The worsted trade is tolerably aetive, though not to say brisk. All descriptions of wools suitable for combing purposes obtain fsu prices, the advices received by staplers from their agents in the ountry intimating that an advance is demanded by the growers; but the marked fimness in rates limits operations to those quantities positively requirea for immediate use. Many purchases have, in fact, been defered until the ruling prices during the ensuing sales have been definitively ascertained, as it is anticipated by the trade that a further enhancement in the raw material will take place. Clothing wools and noils are in limited supply, aind al offered are sold at fully late rates, while in sore cases an advance is realized.
In the yarn trade there isa somewhat active inquiry for home consuption; and heavy contracts are given out at higherprices than those current during the past,nth. The or for shipping purposes is more evely than of late, as the stocks in the hands of the export houses are becoming low; but buyers cannot yet be induced to give the figures re uired to replace materials at the present market value, anl in consequaence business is restricted. Cotton wares manifest ratherimore firmness, with a fair demand, especialy asnregards doubled yarns; the lower numbers of singles, both mule and water twist, are notoouito so brisk.

The weather has been changeable. The young wheats, stinm the disappearance of the seow, are lookding well~ they hare received a cheek, but this will be productive of benefit.

A week of fine dry weathaer has enabled the farmers to get their laud ready for epring Sowing operations. Wheat in some places looks rather dull after the late frost, but, generally speaking, the plant sttands thick and regular on the ground,
The state Of the whea3t trade in this locality continues Inanimate, The trifling advance obtained at the close of last week has niot been mnaintained, 6and only the best dry qualities have shOwn any degree of firmsness Notwithstanding the heaviness of the trade the growvers still make free deliveries, esPeciallY of the secondary ond inferior rurss B3arley has fluctuated in value; the matlturg season is nowr getting oni, and buyers are not so eager to purchase, in consequence of which price have had rather a drooping tendlency.

At toda' market there was a liberal show of wheat, with a marked 'Preponderanrce of damp and indifferent samples, There being a good attendance of buyersto th trade in the best dry qualities was rather brisk, but without advauciug prices, holders findtng that any attempt to do sohImediately checked sales.

A mnost encouragi1g Change in the weather has occurred, and it has given quite an impetus to field operations. Land is being ,reparel to receive spring corn, and where work is forward a good deal of Talavera wheat has been Bowen; sorne barley and oats have been got in by a fewr farmers, who tad the good fortune to have had ploughiug done before the frost set in. The young wheat plant, ftom having for a short timo been covered with suow, looks remarkably well and bealthy.
The corn-market to-day vas again supplied on a liberal scale, and there was a great itnprovemeut in the eonditIon of the generality of parcei Trade was slow, and eventually a reduction of 2i. was accepted for the best and nniddling qualities; but as for the inferior sorts they were diffliult to dispose of, even at a deeline of 3s. The price3 obtained were-White, best, from 64s. to 72s. ; intermediate qualities, 5is. to 64s.; inferior, 503. to 5Ss.; bert red. 60s. to i6S.; secondary rorts. 56s. t, 6Ss.; and inferior, 50S. to 5DS. There was a scantiness in the supply of malting barley, it was sought after with some degree of readiness, and last week's terms were supported. For distilling and grindiug samples there -was only a daU sale, and where transactions were pressed a desline of 1t. took plae. Mealdtg barley realized frOm 469. to 60e.; distillng, 33. to 43S.; ane" grinding, 33s. to 3s. An inquiry for seed oats made business rather briak forthis article, and reaUy good sorts fetched fuily iate terms. old oats, Poland, fetched from 263. to 30s.; new, 26s. to Ms. ; TartAry, from its, to 24s. There was a moderate showv both of beans and peas. the demand for which was slack.
The millers round this district have reduced their price Is., making a total decline of 4s. witbin a fortnight. Households are now seUing at 49i, and seconds at 45s.
The,trado In the local markets ha3 exhibited further depresson. On Monday, at Abingdon, sales in wheat were slow at dul prices. At Aiton, on Tuesday, the best qualities were 2s., and inferior 3s. to 4s, lower.

ROCHESTER, F.n. 14.
The severe frosts have been followed by mild, open weather, whieh has given an impulse to farming operations. Reports coutinue to arrire from the variou districts of the healthy appearance of the young wheats, which have receired a beneficial check. The face of tho country looks promisiog. At the local markets a great many samples of Inferior wheats havo been offered, in most Instances at a redtiction of from Is. to 2s., the previous damp weather haviug deteriorated the quality. Good samples have ruied firm, and generally met wvith a ready eale.
At this oornmmarket there wzas rather limited supply of wheat, but a fair number of factors' samples. Trade on the whole was fiat, a great many parcels being decidedly of an inferior condition, which caused tho trade to be Isacive, buyers holding off for a reductiou. The few good samples offered for sale were readUly caught up at last week's rates Foreign held firm. There was a mcaderate show of malting barley, which was fium; the dem3nd for grinding was slack, at a reduction of 6d. Oats were dull and In a drooping cDnitiou; and aU Lent corn geuerally Is. lower. The foUowing were the prices :-Wlite wheat, new. 6Os. to 63s.; red ditto, 63s. to 69s.; malting barley, 423. to 46a.; grinding, 363. to 39s.; oats, 22s. to 2is.; beans, 36s. to 38s. ; gray peas, 3ay. to 3s.

ZO2VDO, MOXVDA Y, FEBRUARY 16, 1S57.
The great Income-tax question is settled-that is to say, the " war ninepence" is given up-nine millions of taxation are taken off, and a corresponding relief is in store for all those classes whose suffering under the pressure of the accumuiated impost found recently so audible an expression. When we add to this aunouncement that a surplis qf almost a million is reckoned upon at the conolusion of the next financial year, although taxes to tae amount of nearly 12,000,0001. in the whole Ore to be remitted, we shall have described the most esmential features of the new budget. As the Income-tax, however, is now to be introduced
to one more fresh phase of existence, its case will deserve the attentive consideration of the reader.
As a matter of fact the " war ninepence" is a misnomer, for at present the actual reality is a "w ar tenpence," and it would have become after April next, if the rate of taxation had been continued, a " war elevenpence." Ninepence, as Sir C. LBWIs observed, represents the difference between the actual tax and the tax subsisting at the commencement of the war, but it by no means represents the whole additional burden which the war has occasioned. The fact is, that from long and patient endurance we have come to regard 7d. in the pound as a natural or "normal" impost; as something which could be got out of us without unfairness, and which would give us no title to kick or grtumble. When we turn, however, to figures, and look carefully into the national accounts, we find that but for the war the Income-tax woould have stood from April, 1855, not only not at 16d., but not even at 7d. in the pound. In 1853 the impost had been stretched upon the wheel by Mr. GLADSTONE, and doomed to a lingering death; a limb of it was to be shattered in 1855, another in 1857, and in 1860 the coup de gr-ace was to descend, and terminate its existence altogether. But the execution of this sentence was so greatly muodified by the war that some of the results have been almost lost sight of. " The C sevenponce" was carried up before it had time to fall down, and while we gazed at its ascent we forgot thau it ought actually to be descending.
The proposal, therefore, of the CHANcFLLOR of the EXCllEQUER to take off the 9d., but to continue the rate at 7d., does in reality still leave an addition of 2d. in the pound to the Income-tax for the three years to come. Had affairs taken their course without disturbance the impost tnroughout this period wvould have stood at 5d., besides having decreased to (d. in the two years immediately preceding. In reality there never was exactly such a thing as the "war ninepence." The actual excess of rating due to the war was in 1854 7d., in 1855, 1Od. (viz., 2d. added to the former extra 7d., and Id. retained, which in the natural course of things should have dropped off), and in 1856 10d. still. Hlad the tax been continued without abatemen. the excess would this year have been 1Id., a second ld. being maintaiaed, the deduction of which in 1857 was a condition of the regulating scheme. As it is, according to Sir C. LBwis's proposition, the extraordinary rate will be 2d. The additions mede in 1854 and 1855 will be taken off, but the subtractions assigned to 1855 and 1857 will not be made. Adopting the convenient reckoning of a milion sterling produce for every penny of the rate, we shall find that the contributors to the Income-tax paid in the shape of war duties, over and above the amounit of the tax as ordinarily levied, 7,000,0001. in 1854, 10,000,0001. in 1855, and 10,000,0001. in 1856, while they wil have to pay on the same score 2,000,0001. in 1857 and the like sum in each of the two years following.
Again, let the reader look for a moment at the whole course which this tax ha' run. It was imposed in 1842, avowedly as an extraordinary resort, for three years only. lt did not at first yield so much as a million per penny, the 7d. in the pound producing somethingover 5,000,0001., but not more. Sir ROBERT PEEL'S original demand, then, upon property and income was 15,000,0001., or thereabouts. Now, what have property and income actually paid? lnstead of 15,000,0001. they paid upwards of 55,000,0001. before the yield of a million for a penny began to be established in 1854. At the rate of 7,000,ooo0. per annum produce since that time they have paid 21,000,0001. more, making 76,000,0001., aU which was for the current and ordinary necessities of the State, the improvement of our financial system, and the better adjustment of public burdens. Besides this, they have paid, as above described, 27,000,0001. towards the special expenses of the war, and during the next three years, according to the proposal before us, will pay 21,000,0001. more, of which 15,000,0001. may be a-lded to the ordinary and 6,000,0001. to the extraordinary branch of the account. Reckoning, then, with the CHARCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, that the whole cost of the war has been'76,000,0001., andassuming that the extra 2,000,0001. of Income-tax during the next three years is mainly connected with war debts and obligations, it appears that property and income will have paid upon the whole 33,000,0001., or something approaching to one-half of the entire war outlay, besides having contributed six times as much to the general improvement of the finances as was at first required and proposed.
After such an exposition of facts, we think it will surely be allowed, not only that the " war " ninepence " has been fairly taken off, but that property and income will have paid a very respectable share of the taxation of the country when the final period of their relief arrives in 1860. Be it observed that, though the " war ninepence " is taken off, the "war twopence " is still left on; so that the 5d. which was promised in 1853 is to be 7d., and to remain so. It is very remarkable that there has never actually arrived any remission, suspension, or alleviation of this tax from the moment of its first appearance until now. It was never described as renewable, but it was alvays renewed; it has been increased twice, but it has never been diminished; even the prospective reductions of Mlr. GADsroTwE are now abolislhed, and the 7d. is to maintain its vitality to the last, as something beyond which we may easily get, but below which we cannot fall.
We oflfr no objection, however, to the retention of the Income-tax at its criginal rate for the remainder of its term; in faob, throughout the protracted controversies upon this question we have contended not against the use, but the abuse, of direct taxation ; not against the tax itself when invoked as a mighty engine in the emergencies of war or the occasional embarrassmeiits of peace, but against the confusion between substantial property and precarious income which the piinciples of its assessment involved. The 6,000,0001. extraordinary still remaining to be levied is set down by the CnAscor.r.o
of the EXC-EQuEl partly to the accolnt of obligations arising out of the war, and paitly to that of other taxes remitted during the period-so that in either case the tax would be discharging its
special and appropriate functions. That there are some 'who would maintain a larger amount of direct taxation is very probable, and that others, on the contrary, will murmur at the amaount retained is equally likely; but, upon the whole, we think the adjustment acceptable enough, and we at least reap this advantage, even if it be a sorry one, from the pressure of our recent burdens,-that the alleviation is sure to be grateful, although its measure may not be full. " The effect," said Sir C. LEWis, " will be, that nmore than a half of the tax " wtill be r ernitted during the en.Suiug year." There is the simple secret of our satisfaction. We get rid of 9d. out of lGd., and the relief is so sensible that we do not stop to remindl ourselves of the 2d. more, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, would have gone the same way.

The remarks of the CHANCELLOR of the
The remarks of the CHANCELLOR of the EXlcHEQIULR on what may be called the pecuniary incontinence of the House of Commons touch a very extensive, a spreading, and a deep-seated evil. There is no check or limit to the extravagance of a body which constitutes itself the jealous guardian
of the public purse, and, what is more, the protector of the taxpayer's pocket. This is a country and the present is an age in which all classes, from the nobleman and the merchant to the labourer and the artisan, would be greatly beholden to anybody or any institution that would give them the example of an economical and well ordered expenditure. That example they do not find in the House of Commons. HER MAJTAsTy sets an example which may some day be more appreciated than it now is, and some of the leading noblemen and merchants of the country follow it. But the custom rtms the other way, and the House of Commons has fallen into it. Let us see what justification the CUxiCELLoR of the ExCHEQUER has for this complaint, made, let it be observed, to a body of gentlemen always crying out against one tax or another, and seeing the best reasons in the world against every tax in its turn. After explaining why the estimates for the military and naval services Etill are, and wiU continue to be, very much higher than they were before the war, the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER announces that the Estimate for the Civil Service, too, will this year be half a million more than it was last. This is owing to four items, one of which wil be repeated in an aggravated form for a good many years, and the remaining three are perpetual, and with the probability of aggravation. The first instalment for the new public offices is modestly fixed at 80,0001., and the country will probably have to pay about that sum annually-sometimes a good deal more-for the next 20 years. The national contribution to the county constabulary begins with 146,0001. a-year; the extending operations of the Committee of Council require an addition of 129,0001. to the vote for education; and the House of Commons, having generously undertaken to pay the fees of everybody who brings an action or defends one in the County Courts, has to pay for that object out of the pockets of the non-litigant population 180,0001. a-year. These four items make up 535,0001., and the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQJER proceeds to show that a number of other claims made, and some even admitted, may easily involve o like addition to the estimate every year. Deducting the 80,0001. for the public offices, the three other annual charges amount to 455,0001. a-year, equivalent at 3i per cent. to a capital of 13,000,0001., and representing that addition to the burdens of the country.
But what we wish to observe is not the amount, -though thirteen millions of moneyare by no means a trifle-but the rash and unprincipled way in which these things are done. There are few questions in which there exists greater diversity of opinion, or on which the House of Commons has less made up its mind, than the subjects respectively proper for national, local, and private expenditure. It might be imagined from the talk of our legislators that a particular jealousy was exhi. bited towards the persons, and places, and classes, and interests desirous of discharging their own burdensonthe shouldersof the public. But withoutplan or forethought, without much intentional benevolence, and apparently with an unconscious disregard of its own continual protests, the House of Commons is voting away more public money for education, county constabulary, and cheap law. Every session for many years-and this year it will be the same-the House has solemnly refused to establish a system of national education. It wil have no regular system; none that shall reach those who most need it; none that shall bring the education actually given fairly under the oversight of the two Houses of Parliament, of any responsible Mfinister, or of the local authorities. The present is a left-handed system, and it may be said that the right hand knoweth not what the left hand doeth. Yet, while the House of Commons is saving its conscience by al sorts of salvoes, it shows no reserve in its grant of money, which will soon amount to a million a-year. Very few members could give any account of its application, of the teaching to which it contributes, or of the condition of our schools. Few could name half a dozen of the books in use. This would require some inquiry or thought. To go on year by year adding to the grant requires none, and that is aU the House of Commons does in the matter. It acts like the careless Churchman asked by some Roman Catholic or Dissenter to contribute to some questionable object. He says, " Here, take "the money, but don't teU me what it's for." But is this the right course for the British House of Commons?
With regard to the next vote, that for the county constabulary-it's done now, and we gave our voice for the measure. Without the bribe of national aid the country gentlemen would have thrown out the bill. Moreover, we are satisfied that the police is a national affair. But the odd thingisthat the country is not so satisfied. The country gentlemen are not satisfied. We much question whether the House of Commons, if fairly appealed to, would give a full sanction to the principle largely compron ised in this act. Confessedly the transaction has been accomplished by a species of bribery, which we conceive not to be a proper mode of expenditure, and to illustrate the wanit of principle betrayed in the application of public money. As for the 180,0001. in aid of cheap law, the grant was made with very little consideration as to its probable effect in multiplying frivolous and vexatious suits, and one great practical inequality it inevitably creates. The House of Commons may make litigation equally cheap to all parties as far as money is concerned, but it cannot make time equally cheap to all parties ; it cannot make it as little inconvenient for a Minister to absent himself a whole day from Downing-street, or a merchant from the city, or a gentleman to defer an important journey, as for a huckster, or a servant out of place, or any other small personage, to lose a day here instead of losing it there,-at the tap nearest the County Court instead of some more usual place of resort. The inequality in this respect is already so serious that many people, includina respectable firms in this metropolis, have come to the resolution of never defending a County Court case, their loss of time by attendance being a more serious evil than the pecuniary victimization they
incur by not appearing in court.
As we cannot now go into the principles of public expenditure as largely as we should wish, we will only add one example to show what the representatives of an industrious and thrifty people can do, with hardly a thought about the matter, and without any scruple as to the proper line between public and private expenditure. The House of Commons has recently sanctioned a survey for Scotland on the scale of 5 feet a-mile, and it is now being carried on with coltour lines every 2f5 yards. It will give every Scotch proprietor, at the public expense, a better map of his 1,000 or 2,000 acres of moor than is possessed by any English gentleman who has not gone to great expense for such a purpose. It will faithfully record an infinite variety of crags, depressions, gulleys, water-channels, scrubs, tufts, &c., only visited by wild game, and an oceasional sportsman in pursuit of them. A great number of the objects to be recorded, such as huts, fences, an d road s, are in the process of destruction, and will soon only
survive in the map. It will be more than a third of a mile long, atid will cover about 40 acres. Of course, it will suspend all private surveying ia Scotland. One proprietor, by the moderate
payment of 1,5001., has obtained an immediate application of the act to his own estate, so barren and thinly peopled as to make a survey almost ridiculous; and it is estimated that the sirvey of thatestate alonewillcost the public 35,0001. The | survey of all Scotland wiiU not be completed in less 'than thirty years, and WiU cost more than a million.
Over thousands of acres it wiiU cost more than the value of the land. To the public at large it will be perfectly useless; it cannot be comprehended in any portfolio or book; and, even supposiDg the tourist to obtain a few sheets, he would find that at the ordinary rate of posting he passed in half an hour out of one sheet into another. The map made can never be homogeneous; its several portions will not be contemporary; one portion will represent the country as it is in 1857, and another as it wiU be in 1880. It wiU contain villagges, homesteads, paths, and other features that no longer exist, and will give in their native savageness districts which before the completion of the map will be covered with human habitations. We give this as an example of what the British House of Commons did the other day, and may do again any day. It is never safe from financial escapades of the most costly character, and the more it saves by pinching and paring and cutting down salaries already beggarly enough, the more ready is it at any hour to fling away the ten years' candle-ends and cheeseparings into some such abyss as this survey of Scotland.

It is fully believed in Berlin that the King of
It is fully believed in Berlin that the King of PRussxA, now he has got his partisans out of the bear's grip, has not the smallest intention of keeping his part of the implied bargain. He has not, so it is said, the most distant idea of giving up that airy nothing-his right over the canton of Neuchatel in return for the prisoners. The whole story is so absurd that it can scarcely bh discussed with becoming gravity. AU Europe has been set in commotion about the King of PRUSSIA'S honour, and now he refuses to keep his honourable understanding. " Only let the Neuchaitelois " give up the prisoners," said the ingenuous Monarch, "1 and then Europe shall see, and the "descendants of TELL shaU see, what I am capable "of in the way of generosity." Has not this declaration pervaded the political atmosphere of Europe for the last four months? Have not the diplomatists of France and England been running backwards and forwards for we know not how long, like the two foolish old Generals at the military clubs, who when a duel is impending write memoranda to each other every five minutes, and endeavour to persuade the belligerents not to stand so stiffly upon the point of honour-not to thirst so madly for gore? We cannot say how far our French friends have comramitted themselves, but the English PREMIER, it appears, knew his man too weU. He declined to give any guarantee to the Swiss, or to make himself responsible in any way for the conduct of the Prussiau SONEREIGN on any given contingency. The event has proved the soundness of the decision. The KLNG has got his partisans back, and now he refuses the qu'id pro qo, under the pretence, doubtless, that no document under his hand and seal can be produced against him. All that was done was to disseminate throughout Europe the belief that if the prisoners were given up the claims would be resigned. Every act of the Prussian Court, every phrase of Prussian diplomacy, has been directed to this end. It was in consequence of this that the public opinion of Europe at length took a turn, which, if not actually unfavourable to the Swiss, was at least in favour of their making the required concession. Everybody knows that the canton of Neuchatel is and has been for many years past as essentially Swiss as Sussex is English, or Normandy French. We are not ignorant, moreover, that the misguided men who rose against the public authorities in the chief town of that canton-or, at least, their leaders-were in close intimacy with the Prussian Court. The revolt broke out in Neuchatel, but the strings were pulled from Berlin. It has also been asserted throughout-although t'he point is, of course, beyond our knowvledge-that if the prisoners had been brought to trial revelations of the most unpleasant kind as to their connexion with Prussian statesmen would have been made in open court. It was very intelligible that the King of PRUSSIA should wish to put a stop to all this mischief, and to do so with as little loss of dignity as possible. He succeeded. The Swiss werejostled and hustled, and coaxed and worried into acquiescence. It seems one of their agents understood a phrase in a sense too favourable to his own views. The French EmPXRon again threw the great weight of his power and position into the adverse scale at a most critical moment, but he appears to have done so on the understanding that the point in dispute really was the point of honour. In common with the rest of the world he was mistaken. Honour and the King of PRUSSIA throughout all this affair have been a thousand miles apart.
The whimsical thing about the whole affair is, that if nothing more is done the King of PRUSSIA is no more ruler of NencbAtel than he was twelve months back. Supposing from this moment forwards the Swiss Cantons refuse to take the smallest notice of himself or his agents, what can the King of PP.USSIA do? True, he may try another " mobi" lization" and endeavour to recover his rights real or supposed by force of arms. But this time he must carryhis threats into effect, or he will make the Prussian name the laughing-stock of Europe. Now, is he prepared to face the consequences of such an act-the results of such a policy ? With the whole publicopinion of Europe against him-withAustrian statesmen smiling behind his back at the complaisance with which he exhausted the strength of his people and resigned the leadership of Germany into their hands-would the Prussian SOvEREIGN really go and knock his head against the Swiss mountains? We doubt it. The result, then, is, if nothing is done, that his sovereignty in Neuch&tel remains a mere nullity-a zero-a Twefth-night toy. There cannot that we know be the smallest objection raised to the fact that the tiWular Prince of NEUCH-rEL should continue to bear the name in his place of exile at Berlin. It might, perhaps, be wiser and in better taste to adhere to the incoanito of the King of PRUSSIA ; but if the Prince of NEuciitTEL, within his own four walls, chooses to caU himself by this name, we know not who is to prevent him. He might in the same way trench on the dignities of the King of SAntDimiA, and style himself King of Cyprus and Jerusalem,-either course is open to him, and with perfect impunity. Our own Sovereigns were silly enough to retain the title of Kings of FRANcE until the Peace of Amiens, but we have never read that either they, or the people they governed, were much benefitted by the assumption. It was, however, something to call one's-self Kingof FRANCE. If it was an imposture it was a gigantic one, and might be taken as evidence of an aspiring mind. But, had the Kings of EXCLAND insisted upon bearing the title of some beggarly district in Prussian Poland, to which they could not in case of need have despatched a corporal's guard without the certainty of bringing on a general war, we should have said the ambition was but a paltry one. This is pretty much the case of the Prussian SOVEREwIN with the little insignificant canton of Neuchatel. It is divided from his real dominions by the territories of two or three independent Sovereigns. It brings to the Prussian exchequer no revenue. The KI-C
never pretends even to govern it as a province or dependency of the Prussian CrBowN. His connexion with it always has been in times past, and must ever continue to be a source of mortification to him. The people don't want him. If the Emperor LoUis NAPOLEON is by the people's choice Sovereign of France, then the King of PRUSSIA, by the people's choice also, is wt Prince of NEuCHITEL. Had he been simply Prince of NEucUrxTE he would, probably, have been residing for some years in the New-road, or at St. John's-wood in a genteel cottage residence. He happens, however, at the same time to be King of PRUSSIA, and, if not warlike himself, at least the chief of a powerful and well-organized army. The King of PRUSSIA has a fancy in short to be Prince of NEUcn:kTEL. If the desire ever attain larger proportions than those of a wandering fancy the Prussian people must find the blood and pay the bill.
It may be that those philosophers are in the right who talk of the equal distribution of happiness among human beings. Here now is the case of a monarch who stands fifth in power in Europe, with a people under his hand largely susceptible of drill and lectures and decorations, and raps with the paternal staff. He has three or four palaces to live in, which, if not exactly delightful to the English eye, at least please him. He can tinker at creeds and rate his Chambers as he pleases-so patient are his theologians, so much enduring is his Parliament. Surely, such a position would appear to possess certaia latent elements of felicity ; but not a bit of it. There is a spectre behind the bed-curtain-a MORDECAA at the gate. The KmG can't have a Swiss toy which he covets, so he assumes the attitude of JOB, and apes his discomforts, without the patience which rendered the position of the Patriarch just endurable. It i. the same story in private life. Go and stop with a rich proprietor in the country, who owns more land within a ring fence than the eye can take in even from a good point of view, and you wiUl find that the burden of life presses heavily on your friend on account of some squabble with another rural thane, or because he is at war with the parson, or because somebody nine years ego shot his favou-te bull when that interesting animal was making a clean sweep of the turnpike road; but somehow justice was never done in the case. These thoughts and recollections bumn like fire in the human brain, just as his Neuch&tel grievance vexes the King of PRUSSIA to death. How cool and comfortable would that Royal personage feel in the morning when he awakes if ho would just make up his mind to throw off the burden altogether.

To-day the ATTORNEY-GENERAL for Ireland will
To-day the ATTORNzY-GENEBRAX for Ireland will move the expulsion of MIr. JAMES SADLEIR from the House of Commons for not surrendering to the warrarts which have been issued against him for complicity in the frauds of the Tipperary Bank. Such a proceeding is, happily, rare in o-ar Parliamentary annals. Eight years ago the seat for the county of Limerick was declared vacant on account of Mr. SnTH O'BRnm having been adjudged guilty of high treason, but the presen' is an act of a more judicial kind, since the House will be caUled upon to expel a member who has not been legally convicted of any offence. The judgment will proceed on the ground that flight or concealment affords proof presumptive of guilt, and that therefore it is the duty of the Commons to take the game couYse as if the offender had been duly convicted in a court of justice. The sooner the Legislatare is freed from the dishonour of 3Ir. JAMES SADLXIR7s membership the better, and the House of Commons in allowing the last session to pass over without proceeding to expel the delinquent has given quite sufficient proof of forbearance. The last necessary act is now to be accomplished, and the fraudulent cause of such wide-spread misery is to receive all the condemnation which it is in the power of society to express.
The past two years have certainly been prolific of most serious and saddening mercantile crimes. Men of the highest standing, of seemingly stainless character, and, in some cases, of almost saintly reputation, have been found to have been for years in the practice of the most systenatic and heartless fraud. We have had religious embez7lers, philanthropic connivers at forgery, felons of taste, edrcation, and public spirit; but of one thing the country has reason to be satisfied-they have almost all received the due punisliment of their deeds. Wlhatever may be the defects of our law, it has descended with terrible force on the heads of STRAHAN and PAUL, DAVIDSON and GoRDoN, RoBsoN, REDPATH, arcd the rest. Judges and juries have done their duty, and it has been shown that if in the present day the desire for wealth and enjoyment draws men into crime the community is still determined to allow no mistaken lenity to interfere with the just expression of its reprobation. But in one case it must be allowed that the arm of justice has been powerless. The men whose evil doings came to light on the failure of the Royal British Bank enjoy comparative immunity, while their innocent dupes, the crowd of shareholders and poor thrifty depositors, are alone punished. Yet what distinction can common sense and common morality make between the cabal of which Mr. CAMERON with his private book was the centre, and the pair of brothers, one of whom died that fearful dceath on Hampsteadheath, while the other is a fugitive, and perhaps a beggar in some foreign land ? The fraud, the hypocrisy, the merciless disregard of the calamity they were bringing on hundreds were the same in both cases. But, unhappily, the law provides no penalty for such reckless dealing with other people's funds. The House of Commons, however, is allowed by law and custom to exercise an equitable jurisdiction in such cases. Conduct known to be dishonourable, though not legaUy punishable, has been often taken cognizance of by the House when charged against a member. The expulsion of the clief delinquents at the period of the South Sea bubble is a well known instance. Mlay not the House, therefore, allow itself to inquire into the allegations against Mr. Jonx M'GREGon? He has been notoriously concerned in transactions which bear a close resemblance to the doings of JOHN and JAaBs SADLEIR, and, though he has not like them laid himself open to a criminal prosecution, yet there is sufficient reason to examine whether he be a fit person to sit in the Legislature of the United Kingdom. WVe trust the session will not pass away without some notice being taken of the scandalous details relating to the management of the Royal British Bank.

LABOUR IN CANADA.-The despatches from
LABOrR IN CA.ADA.-The despatches from Canada, just issued bythe Colonial-office, amply corfirm all the previous accounts as to the growing prosperity of that province, and the demand Which existsfor labour. This is particularly the case in Canada West, more especially in the newly settlcd districts. XIr. lIawke, the Government emigration officer at Toronto, says:!-" I apprehend no difficulty in disposing of aUl emigrants in se-rch of work who may come to this section of Canada. As to skilled labourers aiid good farm-servants, male and female, there is every prospect of their finding employment at good wages.
ouses are being erected in almost every town and village, and as the farmers have enjoyed an unusual degree of prosperity for several yeats past, farm improvements and extended as weU as superior cultivation have become universal. I am therefore of opinion that all mechanics, such as blaclcsmiths, wheclwr2ghts, carpenters, bricklayers, masons, tailors. shoemakers, &c, as well as agriciltural servants, who may seek employment in Canada West will be able to obtain it, and that f.rmers will fiud farmls suited to their means, and, if prudent and industrious, wivll be sure tn s acceed."

ArroiNilmimrm.-Baron Martin has been added to the Royal Commission for inquiry into the statute and common law courts and the courts of assize, in tho room of Baron Alderson, deceased. The commissioners meet every Saturday, under the presidency of Chief Justice Lord Campbell, to hear evidence, and to decide upon the subject of their labours. Although they have come to no decision respecting the number of judges in the commonlaw courts, it is under. stood that the present judicial staff cannot besafely reduced. The business of the assizes is much more lik-ely to be increased than dimuinished. In fact, we are likely to have a general gaol delivery three times a-year. This view is fortited by the appointment of a new baron of the Exchequer, after it liad been foand that the court was full of business. and that it was not expedient to send a commissioner on circuit instead of a judge if it could be avoided in time. Mlr. Serjeant Channell has therefore been appointed the new judge, instead of being s,nt on circuit as a commissioner only. The law comnmisaion have exaiiined several of the judges, and are about to examine the Authorities and representatives of Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham, &c., who are anxious to have the assizes held in those places.

(FPRoMI OUR OWN COBRESPONDENT.)
{{BOMBAY, JAN. 16.
"Letters from Bushire down to the 30th of De-cember have arrived. Up to that date no attempt to recapture the place or to annoy our troops had. been made by the enemy. They were reported to be mustering in considerable strength at no great distance, but nothing had yet been seen of them, aave by a reconnoitring party of cavalry and horse artillery, who caught sight of a body of horsemen, 'which rapidlyvanished. Rumours of an intended 3ttack are, however, rife in the camp, and our little force considered itself in a position to receive and repel it. One regiment, the 20th Native Infantry, held the town, the remainder of the force occupying an intrenched camp upon the plain in the neighbourhood of the wells and the redoubtfromwhichthe Persians were shelled out by the fleet on the morning -of the 10th. The health of the troops is said to be generally good,i but the 2d Europeans had a large number of men in hospital. At present the climate is pleasant enough, the thermometer ranging from 40 deg. at night to 80 deg. in the sun at noon. And so this first instalment of the Anglo-Indian power is biding its time within the intrenchments; -4ile day after day the great ships which conveyed it are spreading their canvass to the northerly winds in quest of reinforcements. Those arrived, the advance will commence; where to end and by what enemy to be impeded time will show. Teheran and -a Perso-Muscovite army are current words in the imouths of men.
"A second division for service in Persia is accordingly being organized in Bombay to the very fullest -extent that the not over-strong army of the western Presidency is able to afford. General Orders, rewodelling the staff of the whole force, appeared yesterday in the Governnent 0azette. Sir James Outram, as you are aware, com.mands, with the rank of Lieutenant-General. General Stalker drops to the command of the 1st -division, at present under his orders at Bushire, which will be strengthened by the remaining squadron of the 3d Ligl?t Cavalry. The 2d diviSion is given to Colonel Havelock, brother of the ' fair-haired boy' of the Peninsula, who fell in the -charge of the 14th at IRanoniugger, and himself a distinguished soldier in Burmah and in Affghanistan, at Mlaharajpore and on the Sutlej. He succeeded Colonel MIarkhamn as Adjutant-General of the Queen's forces in India-an appointment which he now vacates. The division under his orders 'consists of two brigades-the first composed of the 78th Highlanders aud the 26th Native Infantry, the second of the 23d Native Infantry and a strong battalion formed of the light companies of the regimnents not ordered on service. The Highlanders marched from Poonah some days ago, and were halted at the top of the Bore Gbaut till the transports should be perfectly ready to receive them immediately on their leaving the railway station. Their future comrades of the 26th passed them from Satara while thus encamped, and were received by the Scotsmen with hearty cheers for ' the Cameronians.' The regiment thus playfully designated, after the corresponding corps ini the Royal army, is encamped on the esplanade here, and
nill be inspected by the Commander-in-Cbief this evening, preparatory to embarcation. The -ing of the Highlanders came down by train yesterday, and was shipped at once; the other follows with all despatch. Their senior Lieutenant-Colonel, Hamilton, commands the brigade. The 23d Native Infantry, from Rajeote, will embark, as the 3d Cavalry did before them, at Porebunder, and the light battalion from Bombay, to which point the various companies that wMll compose it are rapidly -converging. Colonel Hall, nowv brigadier at Poonab, will command this second brigade. Colonel WVilson, K.H., of the 64th, succeeds to the brigade vacant by the death of Colonel Stopford.
" The cavalry will be augwented by two corps, -each in its own way superb,-the 14th Light Dra goons and the ]st Scinde Horse; the latter are 800 strong, the former probably 650. The Dragoons
will take ship here, and the irregulars at Kurra- I chee, upon which port they are nmarching from Jacob- I abad. Colonel Jacob takes charge of the whole
cavalry division, Colonel Tapp and Colonel Steuart! of the 14th commanding the iwo brigades. The i artillery reinforcements consist of a field battery! -from Sholapore, and the 4th troop of Horse Artillery from Kurrachee. There are also to bedespatched, 'with a view to service in the defiles that lead up to the platean of Shiraz, two mountain trains, each -consistinig of eight 12-pounder howitzers, and six 5Jinch moitars. Batteries of this kind have been for some years in use among the hills on the Peshawur' frontier, but are now for the first time prepared in the arseiil of Bombay. In the engineer de-
partment the Government are forced to borrow i from Ma0dras, and a steamer left the harbour yes- I terday t., fetch a detachment of Sappers and Miners I from that Presidency. A Land Transport Corps is I organizedl under a director and eight assistants. Colonel Lugard, of Her Majesty's 29th, a soldier of great Indian experience and a most estimable man, is appointed Chief of the Staff. The heads of the Adjut:int and Quartermaster-General Depart-
ments (Younghusband and Wray) bear a high | character for activity and intelligence. Assistant! to the latter is Ballard, of Silistria, the subaltern C.B., and on the rolls of the army are several other officers who served in the late war against Russia, either with the Queen's troops or with the Turkish Contingent. One other project for increasing our strength in Persia remlains to be noted-the employment of irregular horse to be raised among the tribes of Turkish Arabia and the Persian seaboard. To what extent it is contemplated to carry out this schemne I am not aware, nor, very probably, is it definitively settled. Rn'iour even goes as hiigh as 15 regiments, bh;t I have not yet heard of appointments for more than tllree at the most, though I imagine we may expect to hear of about sIX. All appointments are made by Colonel Jacob, many of them under reconiniendations from General Outram. Three bt*ngal officers thus nominated leave for Kurracheo this evening to report themselves to the Colonel, and others of the Bombay army will speedily follow.
"Sir James Outram, with his personal staff, Colonel Lugard, and other officers, went on board the Senauramis last night, and sailed for Buslhire early th;s morning. The Persian prisoners, who had been detained in the Assaye till they were somewhat weary anld querulous, have been sent up to Ahmednugger in charge of the captain and first lieutenant of the shil) and a military escort. On their way they stopped at Poonah, were visited by the authorities, anlt1 fc'{ed by a wealthy Parsee. At Ahmednu-gger, whiere a house is secured for them, they will he under the charge of the judge of that station.
" Such being the efforts of the Bombay Government to display upon the skirts of the Persian empire a force of respectable numierical strength, we are all anxiety to know whether any portion o-f the powerful army cantoned in the Punjab and on the Affghan frontier is to be employed in striking a blow at its heart. This question has doubtless been Well ventilated during the past f rtnight in many a noteworthy discussion betweeu Sir John Lawrence and his guest Dost Mahotmied, for his guest the Ameer actually is, or very lately was, having arrived at Jamrood, in the Peshawur Valley, on the 1st. 'When he left Cabul does not appear, but letters from that city of the 22d of December speak of his having been then heard of fromn as far down as Jellalabad, on his vay
to the Engl,h ffl rontier. The CifCmisoe had been some time waiting for the arrival of his visitor, aud on heating of his approach sent a con-
siderable force four miles mnto the Khyber Pass to meet and escort him. A similar mark of respect -was paid to Hyder Khan when he came down two years ago to sign the treaty, and the officers of the escort, as one of them described to me the other day, vre interested and excited by their ride into the ja-s of the terrible defile. Onthe 3d, as I read in the Delli Gazette, the meeting took place. An imposing force of two troops of horse artillery, two field batteries, and a moiuntain-train, four regiments of cavalry, and six of infantry, three of
them Euglish, formed a lane from Jamrood to Sir Joha Lawrence's Durbar teat. A.s
the Affghan cavalcade came down the lane Colonel iEdwardes, Commissioner of Peshawumr, and the xmlta-.y officers advanced to meet it. At its head rode Saadut vhan, of Lalpoora, the powerful and ofttimes troublesomne chief of the Momunds, now on his very best behaviour. Behind him appeared,
plainly attired in the nai2onal "choga," an old man, worn and wizened, but with his beard dyed a fine black. This was the Ameer of CabuL A likeness of the Dost, taken in 1841, may be seen in Sir A. Burnes's Cabid. It is from a drawfug by a Bengal officer, and is pronounced by Sir Alexander to be an excellent likeness. In his train was seen a litter slung between two ponies, in which was carried a notable prisoner of the Dost's, not to be trusted out of his presence, the ex-King of Balkh. Arrived at the Durbar tent, Doet Mahommed was received with a Royal salute, and the troops formed in column and marched past in review. Sir John and he then proceeded to open the conferences; but our news only coming down to the day after the meeting we as yet know nothing of what has passed at them. It may be easy to guess what the chief will ask for -it is less so to know how much the commissioner is empowered to grant. But if an advance through the passes is decided on, it must soon be known here. Of Herat we only hear from Cabul, whither the information was sent by Ryder Khan at Candahar, that the Persians are busy strengthening the defences, mounting fresh guns, and laying in largestores witha view to further advance intoAfrghanistan. In the direction of the Bolan Pass, or Soutiern Affghanistan, we learn that a portion of the money and ammunition sent to the Ameer by that route had reached Quettah. And of the Khan of Ehelat it was reported at Shikarpoor that he had told the English that he was both wiling and able to defend the Bolan against any attempt of the Persians to penetrate it. This answer it is quite possible he may really have given to Captain Green, who, as I have before mentioned, was lately desp.wtched to him on a political errand, and who, with his mission, as we may presume, fulfilled, is now on his way down from Kurrachee to join his own regiiment, the 1st Scinde Horse.
" The principal item of news from Madras is the death of Mr. Bushby, the Resident at Hyderabad, an able officer in a difficult and important situation. He was seized with an apoplectic fit on the evening of the 29th of December, and expired the next morningr. It is not yet known whom the Governmont of India will appoint as his successor, though the names of several leading Bengal civilians are mentioned. In the meantime Mr. ThornhilU, Mr. Bushby's first assistant, is in temporary charge of the Residency. Coincident with the death of the Resident wve hear of tbe adoption of a measure which in aU probability is partly due to his enlightened counsels. Salah Jung, the Nizam's Minister, and a great friend of Mr. Bushby, has succeeded in obtaining his master's sanction to the abolition of slavery throughout his dominions.
"Dr. Straker, C.B., Physician-General to the Bombay army, died this morning, and while I write I hear the " Dead March" in Saul, and the tramap of the funeral party attending his remains to the grave. The deceased officer, who had been upwards of 33 years in the service, served the Sikh campaign of 1848-49 as superintending surgeon of the Bombay column of the army, and was present at Mooltan and Gujerat.
"Trade in the import-market is improved and active; in the export-market transactions are limited. Freights have declined considerably, and are quoted to-day at 21. 10s. to 21. 12s. 6d. per ton to England. In the money-market there is no change. Exchanige on London, 2s. 24d."

"A few troops are, after all, to be despatched from this country to China. A European regiment has been ordered down from Dinapore; a native infantry regiment wil be sent from Singapore; and the Ceylon Rifles are already on their way. This force will probably be inereased. The total destruction of Canton, whieh had commenced when our last letters left China, will render the quarrel internecine. Sir John Bowring wiU have to contend with all the force which the MIandarins can raise in the southern provinces, and it is difficult to imagine whence forces can be obtained except from India. Atthe same time a large force is collecting at Umbalah, ostensibly to form a camp of exercise, but reaUy to be prepared for any emergency which may arise beyond the frontier. A still larger force is said to be required for Persia, and the Government is almost at its wit's end for troops. I must again point to the danger which these simultaneous demands involve. The Government has never at any time more than three disposable European regiments in the whole empire. Every other regiment moved leaves some province without Europeans, and consequently without any force to control the Sepoys, or meet a danger to which they are inadequate. It is true we can recruit our native ranks as easily as ever-could add 50,000 Sikhs to the regular army in six months. But they canuot be disciplined without officers; they cannot be sent into action without Europeans to support them, and there are neither Europeans nor officers to spare in the country. This is no exaggerated representation. It is a pressing end imminent danger. Even the Government of India, strong as it really is within the country, cannot maintain three foreign wars at once without some addition to the army. If the English Government will not allow us more regiments, it will have to provide wben it is too late against the consequences of its own indifference.
" In this momentary lull, perhaps you will permit me to recapitulate the events, the thread of which, even in this country, it is difflicult to retain.
" After the death of Yar Mahomed of Herat his son became so unpopular that the sons of Shah Kamram, the ruler whose place Yar Mahomed had usurped, began to entertain new hopes. They were living in Teheran, and, aidedbyasmallPersianforce, they contrived to obtain possession of Herat. This event, which occurred in November, 1855, was the origin of the first story that Herat had fallen. The Persians, as you may remember, declared that the transaction was merely a quarrel between Affghan clans. In June, 1856, Esan Khan, General of the Heratee troops and the recognized leader of the Soonies, contrivcd by stratagem to expel the new ruler and his allies. He pred;cted an emeute in the city. The Persians, who were probably not above 2,000 in number, encamped outside,taking with them the puppet they had setup. Esan Khan immediately shutthe gates, and from that time to his surrender exercised uncontrolledpower in Herat. The Persians, finding themselves tricked, sent for reinforcements, and laid regular siege to the town. Esan Khan seems to have held out with sufficient courage. He wrote, however, in vain to Dost Mahomed, who had undertaken more than his strength warranted in Candahar. His provisions, and perhaps his money, began to fall short. He owed no allegiance to anybody, and at last he oflbred to surrender if his life were spared. The Shahzadeh in command not only promised life, but the permanent possession of Hlerat as a vassal and a sum of money. He accordingly surrendered the city on the 23d of October. The money was paid, but the Persian general, on entering the city, picked a quarrel with the Khian, and placed him in confinement. A force was then despatched in the direction of Candabar, the latest movement of vwhich we have authentic intelligence. It will be obkerved from this brief statement that Esan Khan was not what would be caled in Europe a traitor; he fought for his own hand, as most soldiers do in the East, owing allegiance, if to any body, to the Ameer Dost Maho ned, whom he apparently tried to assist; also, that the Persians have in this instance undisguisedlly conquered Herat for them-
selves, and not as the allies of an Affghan pretender.
" Your Bombay correspindent will give you the detaiLs of the Persian expedition with a minuteness 1 cannot hope to rival. 1 content myself, therefore, with adding the few facts which have not yet reached Western India. Of these the most important is perhaps the Governor-General's order on the occasion-

" It is understood here that 5,000 men are immediately to be despatched to Bushire. It is reported that 15,000 more will follow as fast as they can be collected; but this is not quite so certain. The extraordinary order given to Sir James Outram to levy troops in Persia itself is considered true, and is generally supposed to indicate a determination to annex. The secrets of the Foreign Department are, however, so closely kept, that there is little current beyond surmises. One fact, however, is admitted. The Persian expedition is not a demonstration, but the most serious war in which the Government has been engaged for the last six years.
" The Penal Code has been read a 'second time. It must be published three months before it becomes law, but there will be little further delay. It is substantially Macaulay's code revised and, perhaps, amended, but not increased or altered in outline. It contains 20 chapters, each subdivided into sections. Each section contains the general definition of some crime, then a particular definition, then a list of exceptions, and then certain imaginary illustrations, which are to serve as precedents. It is very short, and certainly simplifies the existing law to an astonishing degree. The Friend of Imlia declares that onthefour great Indian difficulties-murder, perjury, dacoity affrays, and the right of self-defence, it will be found an improvement on the existing law. The code, however, introduces but few new principles. The most notable of these are first, in the law of affrays. Aiffrays in this country somewhat resemble what in Ireland are called faction fights. The law is so weak, and the courts so dilatory, that a landholder who thinks he has a right to a bazaar sends armed retainers to take it; his rival defends it with his armed retainers, and a dozen lives are frequently lost. There is a class of men, amounting to many thousands, who live by hiring themselves out for these fights. It is no use to punish them, for evidence is never procurable, and no money is spared in their defence. The Code, therefore, pro-ides that the landlord who seeks or accepts any advantage from such a fight sball be liable to an unlimited fine. The clubman, moreover, may be imprisoned simply for engaging himself as such. The regulation is too weak for the evil, which can only be suppressed by an act rendering the carrying of lethal weapons, or iron-bound clubs, a p6aal offence. 2. In the law of perjury. Any man bearing false witness against another, with the view to convict him of a crime, will receive the punishment his victim would have received if tLe charge had been true. The punishment, however, is not to exceed seven years' transportation. Perjury, of course, is equally a crime in all cases, but the rule strikes a native as the perfection of jastice. 3. In the law of marriage. The Legislature has made adultery a penal offence. The natives have long corAplained of our remissness in this respect. We punish them for killing a rival, and refuse to punish him ourselves. According to the Koran death is the penalty of adultery, and the principles of the Koran permeate all modern Hindoo'sm. In the Punjab Mr. Temple was compelled to insert a clause in his code inflicting two years' imprisonment on the adultesar, or the population would have taken the law into their own hands. This penalty, increased it is said to five years, is now to be the law of the land."
CHINA.
HONGKONG, DEc. 30, 1856.
The London mail of the 10th of Nc-vember arrived here per steamer Madras on the 24th inst. The steamer Formosa leaves to-day, carrying a mail to meet the semi-monthly Calcutta steamer at GaUe. The Madras will carry the outward mail of the 15th of January.
At Canton the foreign factories have been burnt to the ground. The fire commenced about 11 p.m. on the 14th inst., and, although every effort was made to arrest the flames, it proved utterly useless, and all the houses were destroyed, with one exception, which has since been gutted by the Chinese. It was the result of a well planned and executed scheme on the part of the Chinese. The fire broke out simultaneously at different points, and was aided by combustibles, fire balls and rockets, thrown from the suburbs. Many Chinese houses were also burnt.
Mr. 0. T. Lane, of the British Consulate, was killed by the falling of a wall during the conflagration.
No attack was made by the Chinese, who appear to have been quite content with burning the houses, by which act they themselves will be the eventual losers. Most of the houses were vacant, but much valuable property has nevertheless been destroyed.
Our marines and bluejackets exerted themselves to the utmost in saving property; but the spread of the flames -was so rapid that little could be brought away. Shot and shell were thrown from the Dutch Folly during the fire, in order to prevent large bodies of the Chinese assembling near the scene.
Two companies of Her Majesty's 59th Regiment were present, and they are now strongly intrenched in the garden. The clubhouse and church, being detached from the factories, remain intact, and are excellent quarters for the troops.
Our fleet holds the riser as before, and Admiral Seymour has hoisted his flag on board l er Majesty's steamer Niger, at archor off the gardens. Our position is thereore stronger than before the fire. No active measures of reprisal have yet been undertaken, the admiral being apparently determined to wait until troops arrive and enable him to commence operations with vigour.
One of the small postal steamers was attacked between Canton and the Bogue on the night of the 22d inst. by a large fleet of mandarin junks, and
nad a narrow escape from capture. The pilot and one of the crew were killed, and two others wounded. A lorcba, which she was towing, had to be cast off, and was captured, provinrg a rich prize, as she was laden with goods and valuables, removed from the Canton warehouses at much risk and expanse. Before being cast off her crew were taken on board the steamer. T'he junks then retired uD the shallow creeks with which the country is intersected, anid where the draught of water is too small for our men-of-war. Gunboats are very much required.
Mr. Cowper, sen., a British subject, father of the enterprising owner of the Whampoa Docks, has been kidnapped, and no trace of him has yet been obtained.
Some attempts have been made to injure our ships-of-war by sending down on them boats filled with gunpowder, but no harm has yet been done.
Some rebel bands have lately taken possession of a large village near Whampoa, which was their head-quarters in 1854. Although calling themselves rebels, they are mere banditti, and their object is plunder. 'They have been warned against interfering.
At Hongkong there have been no disturbances, and measures have been taken for the public safety. The police force has been augmented, and a picket of the 59th Regiment is stationed nightly nearthe Chinese quarter. All Chikese xe required
to carry a lantert after dark, and between 10 p.m. and daylight none we allowed to move about without a pas. To the respectable portion this is no h,'rdabip, and they are quite alive to the benefit the)' derive from protective measures.
The foreign residents are to be sworn in to-day as special constables, and a fire-brigade is to be organized .fromn among them.
The following circular letter from the United States Commissioner explains the present position and attitude of the Americans here.

His Excellency Peter Parker, Commimaoner of the United States of America to China, &c., referring to the notice of the 9th inst., hereby makes known that the reply of the Imperial Commissioner to his Excellency's despatch of that date was received last evening, and that, with the semblance of a desire to maintain friendly relations between the two countries, the same disposition to evade obligation, misrepresent facts, and erroneously interpret treaty stipulations which for years has characterized the correspondences of Imperial Commissioners still obtains with his Excellency Yeh; the resumption of trade to any extent a the port of Canton during the existence of the local
ties is not encouraged by the tenour of the communication now received, and means more ample than those now at command will be required to meet the emereency of the public interests of the United States in China, and the satisfactory and proper adjustment of the relation ef the Five Forts is an event yet future.
"f By. order,
" S. WELLS WILLIAMS,
" Secretary of the United States' American Legation.' The Viceroy Yeh has shown no desire to arrange matters; indeed, it is said that his power is now overruled by the train bands brought in from the country for the defence of the city.
Many rumours are in circulation; the only one I think worthy of mention is a report in the NortL China Berald that a High Commissioner has been appointed by the Emperor to proceed to Canton and arraDge matters to the satisfaction of the British, even if the concession of all their demands should be necessary. I am unable to trace any foundation for this, however.
Trade remains entirely suspended.
Exchange here on London, 4s. 81d. to 4s. 9d.; on Bombay, 215rs. to 21irs. Very little doing. Freights quite nominal. The Herculean and Wagoola, from Liverpool, are our only arrivals.
At Amoy some alarm has been occasioned by powerful pirate fleets cruising in the neighbourhood. Hler Majesty's steamer Sampson has gone up the coast in consequence. The Chinese soldiery had become mutinous, their pay and rations bein in arrears, but the mandarins having satisfied their demands they returned to their dlaty. Markets for imports were over-stocked. The inquiry was moderate, and prices declining.
l'oochow advices are to the 19th inst. Tranquillity prevailed. In tea there was no change.
Shanghai letters are to the 23d inst. All remained quiet, and nO app?rehension w as felt.
i Shirtings hud been sold to a moderate extent.
In silk 'a fair business had been done. Arrivals are 70,000 bales; settlements, 66,000 bales, leaving 4,000 bales on the market. No. 3 Tsatlees are quoted $345 to $350; Taysaams, middling to fair, $260 to $265 ; inferior, $230 to $235; China throwns, $355; for other kinds we have no quo'.ation.
In tea there is no change to notice. Dealers ask extreme rates. Three vewsels had sailed for London.

The Bank of Bombay hav decrd d a dividend at the rate of 8 per cent. rer aTunum for the past half-year. Securities of all descriptions are flat and dul of sale.
JiTPOrs.
A very favourable change to a considerable extent is perceptible in our import-market, both iu gray goods an yamns; stocks seem to have been reduced, and d&alers seem to be making purchases at advanced prices. The business transacted durng the past fortnight might be snid to have been to a considerable ef.snt. Grwy shirtings up to 71b. are in good inquiry, 6Alb. to 71b. are scarce and in great de nand at advanced rates. Gray long clo hs are not inquired for, but are steady at las' quotations. Gray domestics are in good demand. Gray T-cloths are in good inquiry at a slightly advanced rate. Gray jaconots and Madapollams have advanced one anna, and are in moderate inquiry.
Bleached and Fancy Goods.-These goods, of cartain de. scriptions, have also participated in the advance in value to be noticed in the gray goods.
CochineaL-The market is firm, and the ruling quotation
is 2r. 4an.
Spirits.-Brandy, 1,550 dozens at l1r. per dozen, 500 dozen at 12r.; 700 hogsheads of brandy at 2Yr. per gallon.
Cotton Wool.-.After the departure of the last mail this staple declined iu price, but since the arrival of the Overland Mail of the 11th of Jaruary it has again come up to our last quotations. We quote Broach at l20r,, Dhollera at 117r., and Oomrawuttee at 114r. per candy.
Pepper.-The market in this article isfirm. We quote tBhhuscole at 93r. ; of Mlalahar there is no stock available in
Hemp.-The following are the quotations:-Calicut, 42r. to 45r.; Concau, 37r. to 3Sr.; and Ghatee, 30r. to 31r. per candy.
Oil Seeds.-Linseed is in good inquiry at 4r. 11a., aud rapeseed is also in fair demand at 4r. 13a.
Coffee.-The stocks bave been taken up, and we quote Mocha at 10Qr., and Malabar at 7 ir.
Opium.-The demand for the article has lessened, and our present quotation is 990r. per chest. The Rajah of Cochin takes about 1,281 chests on board.
Tonnage.-The rates of freight have declined to 21. 10s. to 21. 12s. 6d. for London and Liverpool, at which the quotations continue steady.
Exchange.-Previous to the arrival of the English mail first-Class paper sold for 2s. 21d, subsequently 2s. 2Ld. was submitted to, while local lblls and documents sold at 2s. 21d. to 2s. 1~~~~~~~~~~atzs 2d Court bilLs on Calcutta, 60 days' sight, 9S2. Madras, 30 days' sig-ht, 9S:5.

THE CALCUJTTA MARKiET, JAN. 8.
Since our last issee under date the 2-2d alt. w e have been in receipt of the London mall of the 26th of N'ovemberlast. The first intelligence reached us on the 23d ult. by electric telegraph from Bembay. On the Slat the Bombay ddSk put US in possession of a portion of the mails, and on the 2d inst. the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship
entinck delivered her packets. The nature of the advices from England, so far as they relate to the state of the markets for Indian produce, being more favourable, greater activity has prevailed in our prod.ice-market dorimg the
pass rortmglte, and enhanced pArices have been paid forsome of our staple articles, although but for the linited supplies operations would have been on a larger scale.
Mr. Lindsay's screw steamer Tynen-outh arrived here vi4 the Cape on the 5th inst., after a passage of four months. The cause of the delay has not been explained. We have also heard of the arrival at Madras of the steamer Robert Lowe, belonging to the same owner, and she may therefore be looked for here daily.
In indigo we have had less competition, and the public sales show a slight decline in prices. Very little has been done in sugar for want of supplies, and a further advance has taken place in value. Operations in rice have continued on a large scale at advancing figures. An excellent demand bas prevailed for saltpetre, at steady figures. Little doing in raw silk, but silk piece goods are in a better
position. Jute had been in very active request at considerably higher prices, but buyers have been less sanguine the last few days. Oil seeds command fair attention, but, the market is rather eas;er. No alteration in lac dye or shell lac. A better inqiry has prevailed for castor oiL
We regret to report aless favourable state of affairs as regards our sinport-market, which has continued vesy inactive since the despatch of the last mail. In British cotton piece goods and mrule twist transactions have been limited as the season for large purcbases has already passed, and the accumulation of stocks in the upper and north-westerm provnces prevents dealers fzom operating. Gray shirtings have been sellng to a moderate extent at unaltered prices. Little doing in white, aud figured shirtings have been in less demand and value lower. Gray Madapollams command fair attention at previous prices. in Turkey red goods a slight improvement has taken place. Prints and chintzes not
much wanted. The market for mule twist remains depressed, and sales very inconsiderable. Metals have continued without animation, and in some instances lower figures hbve been accepted.
Money Market.-The symptoms of money becoming less abundant are gradually gaiug ground, thQugli during the
week under review our ltket his not become tighter. In the Bazaar captta2i3ts ate kl'Okitg out for higher rates of interest. The Bank of Bmpjl on the 24th unt. raised ita rates of interest and diecot Z-per erut. all round. Its rates are at present 6 per oent er loana ar ed by deposit of Companfs papera, ad 7 percent. for diantn rvate paper. Advances on depoeW of opium papers an t;ll being made in the bazaar at 8 per cent. per annu7n, and it is very probable that higher rates wi be paid afterthe nezt opium. sale. We insert below the usual statement et liabilities and assets of the Bank of Rengal for the week ending ou the 31st ult,, which, as co,'npersd with the statement of the 17th nlt., given in our Ilst, shows a decrmase iPx the amormt of cash from Comnpany's rnpees 129,03:,25,-7-6 to Company's rupees 108,O12,357-10-1:-

Total Co.'s rs. 3.9R@6,479 3 10 Shares.-Bank of Bengal shares have linproved, and are now quoted at 6,500rs. to 6,525rs. A dividend of 125rs. a share, or equal to 6 per cent. per annum, on the original stock has been declared. Bengal Coal eompany'sshares have depreciated since the declaration of tuo last dividend, and we havejust heard of a sale at 1,300rs. each.. Calcutta Steam Tugs have likewise slightly declinei,.and may be quoted at 1,125rs. to 1,150rs. In other jcint-stock companies' shares we have scarcely had any alternlion.
Government Securities.-A limited business- has beets done at steady rates. We caunot notice the slightest altsration in the value of all descriptions of securities, which have ruled throughout the fortnight at 16r. 2a. to 1a. 4i. Cornpany's Fours, 17r. Sa. Sicca Fours, and 0.6.0 to (l-1080 Cons pany's Fives. In the 3.1 per Cents. nothing doiag,.and the rate is nomninally 35 per cent. discount.
Exchauge on London.-Our market continued steady for some days, first-class credits having been placed at 2e. 24d.
and documents at 2s. 23d. per rupee. Some sib months' sight bis received from China by the Fiery Cross were likewise sold at 2s. 2jd., and a small amount of bank bills at 2s. 2 5-16d., but the last two dayg our rates hava had a downward tendency, with sales of credits at 2s. 2jd., and of some local bank bills at 2s. 2'd. These might be considered the closing quotations. Treasury and post biUs are quoted at 2s. 11d. The transactions, on the whole, have not been very large.
Freights.-On the day the last mail closed large engagements for Great Britain took place, but sinCe then we have had less animation, in consequence of the advancing prices of produce in our market. Oar rates have ruled almost the samo as at the date of our last, although in certain instances large reductions were acceded to by ships on the point of comnpleting their loading and clearing from the Custom-house. The engagements during the last week have been rather few; but with the commencement of the year we have reason to believe an improved aspect of .-fairs will be witnessed, and we hope to swe onr anticipations realized. In charters, also, business has been to a limited extent. For Mauritius, China, and thfe Australian colonies we have had A fair amount of transactions. ForAmerica advanced rates have been paid, and one ship has been " retailed" during the past week. For oth6r parts of the world we have not had much doing, and the rates remain unaltered. During the present and next mnnth arrivals of ships are expeoted to be large, but the dem.rnd for torunage for varsons quarters might prove adequate at this season of the year, and thus tend to maintain, if not to enhance, the existing rates.

TO THE EDITOBR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Is nothing to be done for the unemployed artisans ? Your suggestions for their emigration are unattended to. The Government makes no sign
Perhxps the Government is right not to take the initia. tive, but it may fairly be called upon for aid in an emergency like the present. Many thousand workmen are on the brink of starvation in London, while independence and a hearty welcome await them in Australia. Surely their relief is a national object. Is it too much to expect that "he Government should give them a free passage?
Could not the Goveignment, the Emigration Board, and the public combine in carrying out some such plan as the following
1. The Government to provide ships. 2. The public to provide outfits.
3. The lEmigration Board to select the emigrants.
The Emigration Board, folloring their ordinary rules, would preient the emigration of unfit persons, and afford a guarantee to the colony that none were sent out but those whose services were required there.
The experse of on'fits might be met by a subscription. There is no want of sympathy for the starving artisan, whose kit has been reduced to the lowest ebb-it only needs to be properly direcied. Let public attention be drawn to this subject and I am satisfied that an appeal for help would be lberally answered. A committee might then be formed, and tvo or three practical men be appointed to manage the 'work of furnishing oatfits for those approved by the Emigraton Board.
But first the question must be asked of the Government, Wll you give these people a free passage 9

The Criminal Law.
THE CRIMIINAL LAW.
TO THE EDITOR OF TE3 TIES.
Sir,-I have waited a few days to see whether any public notice would be taken of a remarkable trial before Baron Bramwell, at the Old Bailey, on the 6th inst. None such having been taken, as far as I know, perhaps you may not deem it out of place to do so now. A yo lng man, who had just come out of Winobester Gaol for a robbery at Aldershott (not mentioned at the trial), was arraigned for a most heinous offence on the strongest evidence, direct and circumstantial. Rarely, indeed, is it possible to obtain such corroborative testimony in a case of this lind,-testimony which could not be shaken by any subFequent act of the prosecutor or accused. He was found guilty, and sentence of death recorded against him. After passing sentence the judAe bethought himn of sending an offlicer to ascertain whether a statement made by the prisoner and denied by the prosecutor was true. The officer, on his way to test the fact in a cab with the prosecutor, learned from him that he had lied on this roint, which had nothing whatever to do with the case use , an why the boy should havo told a lie seems vholly unintelhgible. The jury who tried the case were not discharged, and the judge recommended them to reconsider their verdict on theground of the lie told b
the prosecutor, which did not affect, however, the truth of the evidence given on other points, still less that of the policeman and surgeon who had corroborated him. The jury at once brought in a verdict of is Not Guilty,': in spite of the protest of the counsel for the Crown, who denied the power of the judge to submit the case again to the jury, The prisoner was liberated next day, and the prosecutor ordered to be tried for perjury. To the latter course there can be no objection, for every magistrate of any experience must regret the difficulty of preventing and punishing perjury, which occurs every day. There is hardly an assault cse tried where there are witnesses on both sides in which perjury is not committed on one side or the other. It is often very difficult to say on uhich; bat when a judge is satisfied of the crime being committed, surely he ought to have summary jurisdiction to punish it, instead of sending the caze to a jury, who almost invariably acquit. In the present case there is no doubt about the fact, and the boy will probably be found guilty; but, althoogh from some unaccountable cause he has lied on a mnost immaterial point, no one, I think, connected with the case has the slightest doubt of the prisoner being guilty of the capital offence. The liar, nevertheless will probably be severely punished; the other turned loose on society an innocent and ill-used man, to do likewise.
I should like to know by wvhat authority the prisoner was again arraigned, and under what act of Parliament. A guilty man once acquitted caunot be again dicted; he would plead autrefois scqsir, and his plea would be good. As usual, therefore, the law is in favour of the guilty man; but what that law is is a mvsterv to

Statue To The Late Lord Hardinge.-Mr.
STAMTU TO TRY, L&TE LOiD HARD GcrE.-Mr. FoleY has finished the model lhe was commissioned to maike for this fine monument, and the castings from it have been completed at Birmingham bv Messrs. Elkington. Judging from the model, as a whole it is unquestionably owe of the most successful and artistio equestrian figures we have seen for some time. The horse is not a failure (rare praise for an equestrian statue nowadays); but, on the contrary, is full of lfe and fire and dignity-powerfully given, vwithout exaggeration or straining for effect, with his feet and tail well disposed to avoid the recurrence of many points go displeasing to the eye of taste. At the same time, notwithstanding the care and skill with which tho charger has been executed, the gallant veteran has the distinctpre-eminence, and we only regard his p awing Arab as the throne worthy of the rider. His Lordship is in the uniform of a General, with a short cloak falling off the left shoulder so as to display his decorations and the limb which was maimed at Liguy. His mild, benevolent countenance is turned with a half smile on the spectator, and the lively-shaped head is left without the disfigurement of a cocked hat. In fact, the difficulty of the modern dress has been so sucoessfully grappled w;th tbat it appears not oDly pleasing aud martial, but even picturesque in its effect, and its outlines are bold and strong, without severity. The sword in the fgure is different from the zegulation sabre, yet it is no artistic creation, but a copy of that always worn by Lord Hardinge, which was made for Napoleon I., purchased by the Duke of Wellington, and presented by his Grace to the hero of the Punjab. The figure, which is colossal in its proportions (14 feet high), haa been cast from guns captured during the Sik-h war. It is te3 be erected at Calcutta, where the subscription was raised ,on the return of his Lordship from the Punrjab.

The King of Prussia and the Canton Neuchatel.
T7he KING G PRJ, .SrA and the CANTOIi d The K NE bt_, hA TEBL.
(FROM ov-R oww M- %MPODEN-T.)
BERLIN, FEs. 9.
In my yesterday's letI r I 'id with reference to Neuclhtel my belief, based on inlo.2nation I had received, that the vie-nrs zad intentions et the King of Prussia donot at present point in aDy wayOi War
a cession of that principality, but rather to a re:tntion of it under such altered circunmgtances as sha1
preclude the probabie recurrence of such compL;a -- tions as have arisen there on various occasions since* the year 18145, tbe period when the Federal SwissGovernment was admnitted to skare with the Pri4m of Neuchatel in- the administrative government of the territory in question.
An regards the prcwention of future complicatione with Switzerland, the King' viewrs, I nmderstand._ point to a return to the purely monarchical relatioo that existed between.the principality and its Prince' previous to 1806, up tor vhieh time, wvhatever thenature of Neuchatel's relations and alliances.withl certain cantons of Switzer3and m.sy have beeni, therem is no trace to be foumd in history of anything like a elaim on the part of Switzerland to any share in thesovereignty or governmnent of the principality. It, was at the Congress of Vienna that this relation, to Switzerland was first intrnduced, for the purpose of enabling the Swiss authorities,, the imxnediate neighbours of France, to ap2ly prompt means of defence in cast that Pcwer, which for more thanm 20 years had kept Eurape in disquizt and war,. should attempt again to invadr- Germany, and to. this end avail itielf of the one weak point of the coteraminous frontier, whish war hitherto dependent for its defence on a distau4 Sovereign. Tor-emedy this evil the then hrng, of Prussia and the Emperor of Austria propose the introduction of. that mied relation to Switzzrland which has since, led to- a number of very inconvenient complications. It was with the sa:ne view of strengthening the common frontier against France that. the Prussian territory on the left bank of. the Pihine was increased' and rounded off that the. Austrian provinces in the Netherlands were incorporated wvith Hblland, and that Bavaria was invested -with that- portion, of' territory which extenda from the Prussian fortress Saar-Louis eastwards to the Rhine, and known- as the Bavarian. Palatinate; thus Holland, Prus3ia, Bavaria, and Switzerland were constituted so many posts forobservation- and defence against revolutionary and Imperial, France. It is averred here nor that the necessity wluch called for-that policy has long since passed away; France is no longer republican and' revolutionary, and l'Bmpir-, c'est la pixd. Europe looked on quietly when Belgium ceparated itself from Holland in defiance of the treaty of Vienna, and has since then sanctioned the separation; the King sees no-reason why Europe should now interpose any objection to Neuchatel's being relieved from that epicene relation toSwitzerland, the neces-
eity for which no longer exists, and which- has produced only evil in the territory subjected to it.
The prosecution of these views will form only a repetition of the steps takenby t:AelateKing in 1832-4, hut which, although they had, as it is said, obtained. the assent of the great Powers of Europe, were! frustrated by the opposition of the Swiss and their refusal to negotiate for the withdrawal of Neuchatel from its federal relation. The present position, however, is so far different from what it was then. that Switzerland has in the meantime repudiated.
the bond on which the relationof Neuchatel to itselfwas based (Pacte Federal, Aouit 17, 1815), and assumed another in 1848,which has not yet attained the recognition of any State at alL. Looked at from this point of -view, the Swiss Federal Government has forfeited by the events of 1848 the rigbts in Neuchatel which were accorded to it in 1815, and the consent of the Great Powers of Europe were given to the views here sketched out; there is now no legal obstacle to prevent the Princeof NeuchAtel from vindicating his rights to an undivided sovereignty there by any means in his power.
As regards the prevention of any. future complication of Prussia with other Powers of Europe on account of Neuchatel, the returnr to its formermonarchical relation would disturb nothing in the recognized neutrality it always enjoyed, even before its admission into the Helvetic Confederation. Friedrich Wilbelm IV., as Prince- of Neuchitel, would propose to rule his principality solely by and through native NeuchUtelois; to appoint no Prussians to bear office there; and as no- revenue in former times was ever withdvawn thence, so also hewould continue to apply it only for the advantage of the said little land. Neachatel wonld thus become in familiar language a private pocket property for the House of Hohenzollern-Brandenburg, to be visited and petted in times of prosperity, and to befled to as a refuge should evil days of revolution or invasion ever overshadow this country again.
I mentioned, further, in my yesterday's letter that, according to what I hear, the King, although he may at a later period recognize the expediency of renouncing his sovereignty over Neuchatel, will, as long as the present resolutions hold, under no circumstances, and on no termns, cede it toSwitzerland. These resolutions will surprise those only who are unaware of the long series of vexations and insults that have been put uDon hiln by the various successive Governments of Switzerland in 1847, 1848, 1850, and in last autumn; theseare of a nature and extent (although- little or no mention of them had come into the French and English press) that no man having blood in his veins, let alone Royal blood, could in the King's place be moved by other than deep indignation, and this feeling has doubtless been enhanced by a consciousness of his utter incapacity, consistently with the principles he has always profes-ed, of righting himself by mili'sary force.
Assuming that there is no sufficient power at command, on the part of Europe, to compel the King of Prussia to cede his rights to any particular State, it will strike every English politician as expedient to leave the attempt alone, and let him recover his principality as best he may, either by negotiations with Switzerland or by the award of a conference, or by force of arms. For if he is to give it up, and Switzerland is not to be the assignee of the principality, it is quite evident that France alone would come in for the reversion ; she is the only Power that, next to Switzerland, would attach any value to it, and is, moreover, at the same time strong enough to take possession of it when once the right is assigned her. France has already been mentioned in Court circles as the only Power to whom en) dernier ressort Neuchatel could be made over in case the King sbould be prevented from retaking possession of it, or from keeping it when once he bas got it; and, unexpected as the intimation may be, the idea has. by no means been scouted. The Emperor Louis Napoleon has within the last 12 months " gained golden opinions" in the highest circles bere. When be was only President of the Republic he offered no opposition to the Prussian troops putting down the insurrection in Baden, which it was expected he, would do. Only lately he offered a free passage to the Prussian troops through the eastern corner of France wbenever the King should find himself compelled to occupy Neuchatel by military force; and in the whole conduct of the lave negotiations, as far as is known here, he has conducted himself so loyaUy that he has quite disarmed the traditional deepseated animosity of the Prussian Court against France.
How the Emperors of Austria and Russia are lik-ely to express themselves with reference to the King of Prussia's ceding the principality of Neufch&tel to the republic of Switzerland I need not point out. The position- of the Emperor Louis.
Napoleon will probably preclude him from offering any advice on the subject, since he is mediator between ,the two parties ; and our own Court ean have no interest in selling the inheritance of the future Crown Prince of- Paussia deprived even of this little, territory.
Small as t)e affir is, you see it is one that will not easily be set straight.

(A portion of tho following appeared In our second edilion of Saturday:-1
PARIS, FRIDAY, FEB. 13, 6 P.M.
The Monite7r has the following announcement: - " The Emperor will, on Monday next, at 1 o'cloeck, open in porson, in the SaUe des Mar6chaux, the legislative session of 1857, and receive the oaths of such members of the Senate and Legislative Body as have not yet gone through that formality. AUf the persons caUed on to form part of the cort6ge of their Majesties, as weu as the Diplomatic Body, the Cardinals, Ministers, Marshals, Admirals, Deputations of Grand Crosses of the Legion of Honour, and the officers not belonging to the Imperial households, wil enter by the staircase of the Pavillon de Flore; and the members of the Senate, of the Legislative Body, and of the Council of State by the stair. aeo of tho Pavilon de l'lorlogo. The persons who are to be present at this ceremony must be at the Palace of the TaILeries at half past 12 at the latest, Salvoes of artillery will announce the commencoment and the conelusion of the ceremony."
People are already speculating on the speech from the throne. It will, it is said, announce the probability of a pacific solution of the Neuchatel question, as also the settlement of our dispute with Persia. Much reserve, if not complete silence, will be maintained on Naples. It is doubted whether any allusion will be made to a new French loan.
Two or three days ago circulars were sent to the diplomatic agents announcing that Paris is to be the seat'of the Conferences on the Neuchstel question, and negotiations are going on in the meantime, so as to render more speedy and certain the settlement of it.
On the subject of the Danubian Provinces I am informed that a communication has been made to the Emperor by the English Government of its opposition to the union of those countries.
The M1oiteur de la Flotte contains the following:-
" All the arrangements for the evacuation of Greece by the alied troops having been made beforehand by Admiral Count Bouet-Willaumez, it is thought that the embarcation of all the men and stores may be completed by the 15th to the 18tb inst., and that the troops will have reburned to Totulon by the 1st to the 3d of March. The French expe. ditionary corps in Greece amounts to 1,800 men, consisting of marines, marine artillery, and half a squadron of Dragoons, au under the superior command of Admiral BouetWillaumez, who at the same time commands the French naval division of the Levant. After the departure of the troops Admiral Bouet-Willaumez will remain at the Pireus, having his flag on board the Pomone steam screw frigate.'
A letter from the Romagna, of the 6th instant, gives a fresh example of the anarchy which prevails in the Papal States. For some years past many of the Pope's subjects have been arrested by the Austrians, imprisoned, tried by court-martial, and convicted, the Papal Government maintaining the poor wretches in prison. Since the amnesty published by the Emperor of Austria the Austrian authorities have ordered the discharge of the prisoners who are in prison under sentences of courtsmartial. The Papal authorities have resisted this order, which is, in fact, an act of sovereignty exercised by the Austrians in the Roman States, but the Austrian Generals were peremptory, and the Roman authorities submitted, but with the worst g,race possible. For instance, the prisoners detained in the Castle of Paliano received the news of their liberation, but, in place of simplv setting them free, they were carried in chains to Rome, accompanied by thieves and assassins, in open carts, exposed to the severity of the season. They must have died of cold and hunger but for the charity of the Gendarmes who escorted them. Having arrived at Rome, they were placed in a dungeon, and it was only after some days that the Government resolved to discharge them. It is believed that the assassins of the unfortunate Count Lovatelli have lieen arrested.
The Grand Duchess and Regent of Parma has liberated the political prisoners in the Duchy, on condition that they shaU expatriate themselves beyond the seas.
The Journal des Debats of Wednesday contained some remark-s on the strictness of the regulations which in England prevent British subjects from wearing foreigu decorations unless conferred for services in the field, and it points to the contrast presented in this respect by France. France, an essentialy military nation, placing, if not in theory, at least in practice, military glory above all other fame, yet grants her highest distinctive signs of honour, her crosses, stars, medals, andribands, to those who have not distinguished themselves on the field of battle,and she permits her citizens to accept similar honours from foreign Govemments; while England, an essentially commercial nation, esteemingthe services rendered to science, industry, and civilization farmore than military excellence, will only permit the latter to be rewarded. It may beawise policy to prevent aninvasion of foreign decorations, accorded indiscriminately to men devoid of any known merit, and many of whom perhaps hardly know the geographical position, and still less the history, of the States whose insignia they display, yet there are cases where the strictness of that prohibitory regulation may with advantage be relaxed in favour of eminent civilians. Militarv merit is not the only merit which a country like England should reward or allow to be rewarded in this way. Where men of acknowledged excellence in the arts and sciences, of European celebrity, and whose services have conferred vast benefit, not on one country, but on mankind at large, are presented with a testimonial in the shape of a riband or a cross, the permission to wear it wouild hardly diminish their loyalty to their own Govemnient or affect their patriotism. One can understand objections in the abstract to such things as decorations at all; but so long as they subsist, and so long as human vanity attaches value to them, there is no reason why the ruiles of common justice should not at least be observed. There is not much intrinsic value in a bit of metal or enamel worked into a cross, and the inch or two of riband which is displayed at the buttonhole may be purchased for 10 sous; but, in spite of all that can be said, men will, whether in a sarage or civilized state, attach importance to these things. It is certain that there are few of these institutions in any country which have been more abused than the Legion of Honour, yet the croix d'honneur is still prized by the soldier and the civilian, as if it had never been prostituted to favouritism or lavished on corruption. Under the Restoration every effort was made to bring it into disrepute; and to avoid the penalty attached by law to those who wear insignia to which they have no title many wore the leaf of a flower in the buttonhole, which, at a distance, resembled the riband of the croix dh1 me1o-. In addition to the vast numbers on whom it was conferred by a Governnient that omitted nothing to throw discredit on every institution of the Imperial regime, a perfect c.-rnucopia of crosses was indiscriminately poured out utider the Orleans dynasty; they were lavished on favourites or given as bribes to deputies and electurs. The distribution has been, no doubt, amp!e unider the present reign, and there are not a few who stalk about with red ribands and stars wwhose sole merit is political apostacy or servility. I have been assured, however, by an eminent manufacturer of those articles, that. all things taken into c- nsideration, the abuse is proportionately les undir the present reigime than under the former Governnient.
It is, I believe, merely a regulation, and not a law, which refuses to British subjects the privilege of wearing foreign decorations; but, whatever be thought of the principle of that rule, exceptions
might be made in the case of some very distingituished inoividuals; moreover, the regulation is not invariably adhered to. Prince Albert, to begin with, is a Knight of the Golden Fleece, and probably of many other orders of chivalry, and I am not aware that these multiplied honours have been conferred for distinguished services in the field. The Kings of England, as Sovereigns of Hanover, were wont to confer the Hanoverian Guelphic Order on numbers of persons, British subjects. No objection has ever been made, though it will not be pretended that it was not, in point of fact, a foreign order. The Emperor of the French conferred on a few British subjects the decoration of the Legion of Honour on the occasion of the Paris Exhibition; they are not authorized to wear it, because their services, however useful to society at large, were not of a military nature; as if the merits of such men as Brewster, Stephenson, Faraday, and others eminent in those arta which promote human happines,mwere not eqpal
or far superior to several who have received such honour under the pretext of " miitary services!" bn1eiwpe the exceptions to the general rule in 4zvogr f hose civilians of acknowledged merit, the utsnoet atriotnee mnight be observed, The services
for which the honour is conferred mightbe carefully exanined, so as to preclude the possibility of favouritism or interest having anything to do with it. The authorization of the British Crown might be exclusively granted to the comparatively few who can show substantial claims, and there will be no fear of abuses. The Monitew of yesterday contained a decree granting the Cross of the Legion of Honour to two persons at Honfleur, one a mariner and the other a custom-house officer, for saving under appalUing circumstances the crews of two English vessels, who but for them would inevitably have perished. These are acts the rewarding of which all wvill applaud. Had those persona been British subjects who had rescued Frenchmen from certain death, Ifhardlythink that the same honour conferred by the Emperor would be thought excessive, or that the authorization of the British Government to accept and wear it would be attended with any mischievous consequences. It has been remarked, that they who in Parliament always strexuously and invariably resisted a less exclusive distribution of honours to the veterans who fought and bled for England in the great wars of the present century were precisely those whose breasts were coveredwith decorations from almost every crowned head in Europe.

It has been stated that the Minister of State, M. Fould, was recently charged by the Emperor to inquire into the wants of the population of some of the southern departments, both as regards food and work. After fulfilling his mission in the departments of the Landes and the Hautes Pyrenees, he was taken ill at Tarbes, and was unable to proceed to the Haute Garonne and tho Gers, which he had also been charged to visit. In consequence he summoned the Prefects of those departments to him at Tarbes. The Prefects gave him a full account of the situation of the respective populations, and he afterwards, in the name of the Emperor, presented one with 6,000f. and the other with 8,000f., for the relief of the most necessitous families.
At the moment when the Empress was yesterday crossing the public garden of the Tuileries to go into the reserved part a young man rushed out from among the crowd and threw himself on his knees before Her Majesty. He was immediately arrested, and, being found to be labouring under insanity, was sent to the Prefecture.
A letter from Toulon, dated Wednesday,announces that the Grand Duke Constantine, High Admiral of the Russian Fleet, is expected there within a few days to visit the docks and the arsenal. The fleet is to perform various evolutions ou the occasion. Great activity is displayed at the Mourillon to have the steamship of the line Fontenay and the frigate Foudre ready for launching on the arrival of the Grand Duke.
The heavy snow which bas fallen on the mountains in the Var has driven numbers of wolves down to the plains, where they have committed great destruction among the flocks of sheep. The shepherds adopted a stratagem to accomplish their destruction. They injected the dead carcass of an ass with poison, which the wolves devc-ued, and six of them were found dead the following day.

A letter from Milan of the 10th inst. contains the particulars of an occurrence which took place a few days previous at Mivantua, and which has created an unpleasant sensation both at Mantua and at Milan. A young man named Bianchi being at the theatre, and not approving the performance, began to hiss. An Austrian officer told him that if he did not cease he should turn him out. Bianchi retorted, and a discussion ensued, which ended in a challenge. The duel was to have taken place next morning, but in the meantime Bianchi was arrested by the police, and the officer, having gone to the ground, and not finding his adversary, withdrew. After a day's imprisonment Bianchi was liberated; and, having entered a coffee-house, he met the officer, who loaded him with abuse. Bianchi replied, and the officer attempted to drawv his sword, but the young man knocked him dowrn with his fist.
The matter would have ended there, but seven other Austrian officers cname to the assistance of their comrade. Bianchi caught hold of the officer's sabre, placed himself against a wall, and defended himself as well as he could. He would eventually have been massacred, but a number of civilians rescued him. The municipalitv of Mantua has sent a deputation to the Emperor to request His Majesty to adopt measures to put an end to the insolence of the Austrian officers.
The official journal of the Two Sicilies of the 4th inst. publishes a Royal Ordonnance, dated Naples the 9thof December last, and countersigned by the Ministers Murena and Troia, by which the moral and religious direction of the central prisons of Salerno, Aquila, and Potenza is confided to the rev. fathers of the Society of Jesuits. A Jesuit is to have a deliberative voice in the Council.
The Piedmontese Gazette of the 11th inst. publishes an angry artide in reply to the MiZan Gazette, in which it reminds the Austrian Government of all the sacrifices Piedmont made for Austria in the year 1790, and how perfidlously the House of Savoy
was treated in return, and of the contempt which the Eouse of Austria has shown for treaties whenever it was her interest to violate them. as in the case of Cracow.
The mlasn Gazette replies as follows to the article of the Ho%itmWr relative to the affairs of the Danubian Principalities .-
"The article of ths rench official organ defending ths. union of the Principalities thwarthevjiew, of Austriaand Gret Britain, who had declared thenmseles in favour of a

and England are not Powers to allow themselves to be readily turned aside from their plans, or to fail in their ob. aervaace of treaties.

VIENNTA, FEB. 11.
It is said that the p resent poicy of the Austrian Government in the Loinbardo-Venetian kdngdom "tih a consequence of the influence of Sardinea;" but such anassertion could hardly have been made if what has been doing here during the last few months had been known. Long before the Emperor left Vienna itwas resolved that changes should be made in the administration of more than one of the Crown lands of the empire, and quite as much wil be done for Jungtary, the neighbour of Turkey, as has been done for Lombardy, the neighbour ef Sardinia. In a word, the Austrian system is about to undergo some modification, but it would be wrong to suppose that either the influence or the example of ardinia has had any effect on the resolutions of the Emperor. In the month of November last the Austrian Government confidentially informied the French and English Cabinets that a general amnesty would be granted when the Emperor went to Italy, and it is a patent fact that the clemency of His Majesty has given as much pleasure to Eer MLajesty's Government as it has given annoyance to the Turin Cabinet. A shoit time since Monsignore Amici, the Prolegate of Bologna, conclsded a convention with Austria, in which it was stipulated that in future onlytraitors and robbers should be subjected to military law; but it is to be hoped that the occupation of the legations of Bologna and A ncona-which has now lasted above eIght years, and must have cotathe Papal Government a very large sum of money-will soon cease. The occupation of Parma is said to have cost that little duchy no less than 4,000,000f. When Austria, many years ago, offered military assistance to Naples, the King, who recollected what the Austrian occupation had cost the State in 1821, exclaimed, "I should prefer a locust plag,ue to an Austrian auxiliary corps."
A few days sinceat e Hungarian committee which was formed for the purpose of making the necessary preparations for the reception of the Emperor waited on the Archduke Albrecht, the GovernorGeneral of Hungary, in order to report progress. When the Archduke expressed his hope that their Majesties would be received with enthusiasm the committee replied that the Hungarians, being a loyal race, would feel themselves honoured by the visit of their Sovereigns. As the evasive answar did not satisfy his Imperial Highness, he requested the committee to state clearly and unreservedly what were the real sentiments of the nation. I cannot exactly repeat the words used by the spokesman of the party, but the sense of what he said was, that as his nationality was dear to every Hungarian, the interference with the national schools and the attempt te force the German lang,uage upon the people had produced an extremely unfavourable impression. It is also stated that something was said about the new marriage laws, but my private informant, an UJltramontanist, was either unable or unwilling to give me any information on the subject. The Archduke, who probably expected to hear a very different report from a committee composed of the most conservative and loyal men in the kingdom, completely lost his presence of mind. A general amnesty for the whole of the Austrian empire is, I am told, now being prepared at Milan, and it is very probable that such is the case, for it would be extremely bad policy to keep Hungarian and Austrian political offenders in prison now that their Italian brethren have been liberated. It is very generally stated that the Archduke Stephen, the ex-Palatine of Hungary, who has been living at Schaumburg since the year 1848, is about to return to Austria. As you will probably recollect, the Archduke Stephen was here suspected of being too good a Hungarian and too lukewarm an Austrian.
We learn from Rome that the necessary preparations for the reception of the Dowager-Empress of Russia have already been made in the palace inhabited by the Russian Embassy. It is believed that Hler Majesty will leave Nice on the 20th of March, and go by steamer to Civita Vecchia. The Crown Princess Olga of Wultemberg and the Grand Duke Constantine are also expected at Rome.
The Vienna Volksfreund, which is one of the organs of the Ultramontanists, has the impudence to assert that Salvatore Angona, the murderer, is " an agent of the Protestant propaganda." It must, however, be observed that those Catholics who refuse to believe in the dogma of the Immaculate Conception are now considered Protestants. There is a strong impression on my mind that there is about to be a great convulsion in the Roman Catholic Church.

BERLIN, FEB. 12.
About the beginning of this month Austria first, and then Prussia, forwarded identical notes to the Cabinet of Copenhagen pressiug for an answer to their last remonstrances, which have lain now some months unnoticed. The Danish journals had for a long time past been announcing every week or so that the answer had been sent off, but nothing has been heard of it in Germany as yet. The answer was, duriing the Neuchatel complications, uniformly described as refusing any hearing to the German Powers on the subject of the maltreatment of the German duchies; but it appears now as if, during the last alterations to which the document has been subjected by the coUeagues of Herr von Scheele, the entire draught had been laid aside with a view to another tone aud tenour being adopted.
It is only very gradualy that the careful readers of even the inspired press here are arriving at the knowledge of what I reported to you a week back -via., that the intention of the Prussian Govemn-
ment is, whenever a conference meets on the subject of Neuchatel, to show cause why the oting ought to
be restored to the full enjoyment of his rights of sovereignty over that principality, not only as they were before 1848, but also as they were before Switzerland received any share in the adminis-
tration at all. The form of words which is used to shadow this f orth is-
"The object of the conferences will be to obtain for Neuchitel a -legal and rightful position, recognized by all parties."
The quesestion of the Union of the Da ,ubian PrinciPalities this Government professes to treat for the present as an open question.
Dr. Wichern, the founder of the Raues Haus
in Hamburg, the prototype of our Ragged Schools has just entered the Prussian service under circumstances highly flattering to him; he will in future
devote his winters to Prussia, reservimg his summers for the continued care of the iustitutions he has
raised up in Hamburg. Hs first task in Prussia wll be to make a tour of inspection throughout
the kingdom, after the conclusion of which the reform of prison discipline, which has been long on the tapis, is to be entered On.
In the matter of the Sound Dues it would appear as f this Government intended to raise a loan for the purpose of paying off its whole quota at once ; by this course the country will gain the whole advantage allowed by Denmark for the anticipation of the payment, and at the same time offer a safe investment to its own subjects, instead of paying the inteftst to a foreign Government. In this country,
which is supposed to be so poor, there is always | money to be had for Government seeurities; it is I only for industrial speculations that money is not
forthcoming.
Baron von Branow presented his eredentialr to the King at a special audience the day before yesterday, and on the same day Baron von ileyendorff left here for St. Petersburg,
SWITZERLAND. The Suisse contains the following
The Swiss journals, which entertained the greatest con fidence in the prompt solution of the question of NeuchAtel' begin to share the fears which we have expressed with ro' gard to the affair, and to complain of the little progres3 made in the negotiations. The Bund itself dwells on the strange language employed by the journals and letterd from Berlin, which is of a nature to cause doubts to be entertained of the disposition of Prussia for an amicable arrangement of the conflict. The same letters deny that Prussia has ever entered into engagements with any Power whatever to renounce entirely her rights over Neuchatel, in return for the unconditional release of the Royalist prisoners; they declare that Prussia simply said that by the releasd of the prisoners it would be possible to enter into negotiations on the abandonment by the King of his rights, but that nothing positive was promised on the subject. We may remind Prussia that henceforth it will not be with Switzerland alone, but with France and Switzer. land, that she vdll have to deal, if she should refuse to subscribe to the promises made by her to the Emperor of the French."

At a meeting of the Nashville Railroad Company held at Louisvile on the 15th ult. it was (says the Louisvill Journal) divulged for the first time that nearly $600,000 of. the bonds of the company had been misapplied by the company's agent in London.
cThe bonds," says the Journal,-
" Were issued three years ago, and carried by the then president of the company to London for negotiation. Not succeeding to his wishes at that time, they were left in the hands of an agent, the brother of the chief engineer of the road, to be negotiated, under the direction of and en such terms as should first be approved by the company, for iron for the road. It appears that the agent, in gross violation of his trust, used a part of the bonds in the purchase of a steamship, or some other vessel, for the avowed purpose of freighting the iron that should be bought for the company. This vessel he chartered to go to the Crimea, and she was lost on the voyage, and, as it would appear, without insurance. When caUed to an account he alleged that the vessel was the company's, and the loss theirs. What amount of the bonds was used in this transaction is not known, or what has become of the balance of them has not yet been discovered, as no satisfactory account can be ob. tained from him of their disposition. A committee of stockholders has been appointed to visit London, and to take proper means to recover the bonds and to prosecute the agent."
John Lawler, a soldier, had voluntarily confessed to the murder of a young woman at Rathdrum, Ireland.
Advices from Mexico to the 20th of January report the suppression of the insurrection at San Luis Potosi.
There were rumours of an insurrection at Puebla. At NewYork trade, in consequence of the severity of the weather, was dormant. There was an increased demand for money, and, although rates were not niateriaUy changed, the market was evidently firmer. The current rates were 8 to 9 per cent. for prime two or four months' paper. The bank statement showed an increase in exchange. There was a pretty large business for the Persia, and some of the bankers raised their prices for sterling bills to 9 per cent., but without sales. The market closed flatly. There was rather more movement in cotton, and, owing to the falUing off of receipts, prices had advanced lc. Flour was dull. Grain continued inactive. Iron quiet. There was a good demand for tobacco. Freights without important change. There was an increased supply of tonnage, and a good demand existed,
At New Orleans, on the 3d inst., cotton advanced one-eighth per cent. Freights quiet.

Fearful Smash Of An Express Train.-
FE:ARFUL S3MASH OF At? EXPRESS TRAIN.- SHIELDS, Saturday night.-Great alarm was causedhere last night by the report that the coming express train on the Newcastle and Tynemouth branch of the North-Eastern Railway had run off the line and maimed several of the passengers. ;The report was correct, and, though the casualty was fearfully alarming, probably never was there such a small amount of personal injury with so extensive destruction of property. The 4 45 express train is run upon the Tynemouth line to bring the merchants, brokers, and shipowners who have been engaged on Newcastle-quay aU day to their seaside residences in the evening. Yesterday when it left the Central Station in the latter town it had about 20 passengers, and it ran at express speed until it passed the village of Percy Main, when the driver of the engine began to puU up for North Shields. Within about a quarter of a mile of North Shields, and a few hundred yards of a bridge that crosses the turnpik-e to Newcastle, the rails are somewhat uneven, and trains jostle and shake in passing.- By an unhappy coincidence two old carriage-, formerly belonging to the York and Berwick Company, were next the engine, and when the train was witbin about 300 yards of the bridge an axletree of the firsb carriage snapped, and a fearful scene ensued. By the concussion the body of th. first carriage was torn from the springs and pitched upside down across the opposite pair of rail, and the other carriages, some on and some off the line, ran towards Ahe bridge, the second carriage rushing against the parapet wall and rearing on end, knockiDg great sbones at the same time on to the turnpike below. The coupling-chain connecting the engine with the train fortunately snapped by the sudden jerk occasioned by the axletree breaking, so that it ran away and left the carriages, and, the speed having been taken off them previously, the carriages went no further than the wall. Several persons who saw the accident ran to the assistanceof the passengers, and those in the last carriages were got out with little more injury than the shock from the conession. But on proceeding to the lirst carriage, which was capsized a papsenger was extricated who appeared to be seriously hurt. He proved to be Mr. Oswald Ietchon, thibrd clerk in the North Shields Custom-house. He was an invalid, poor fellow, and had gone up that morning to Newcastle to see his brother for a little change. He was badly cut about the head, and one of his arms is broken in two places. In his delicate health his case is critical. A Dutbh merchant was taken out of the same carriage, much out about the head, but his case is not verv serious. Two ladies, Mrs. and Miss Green, of Wihitley, were also taken out of the second carriage la good deal injured. Sir Jobn Fife, of Newcastle, happened to be in the train, and he inlmediately attended to the wounded, who were removed to their homes as speedily as possible. Sir John has seen Mr. Detchon to-night, and he is doing as well as can be expected. The carriages were broken Up in an astonishing manner by the accident, and workmen were engaged some hours last night in removing the wreck. There is no doubt that the two first carriages, which appeared to be old and worn out, were unfit to travel express speed, and some complaints had been made previous to the accident with regard to them. It was a fortunate tbing that the connecting chain between the engine and carriages broke, else the whole train would most likely have been precipitated on to the turnpike below.
TEB LATE HEivy GAiXs.-From returns made to the B ardof Trade it appears that the numbers of wrecks, strandings, and collisions on the coasts and in the seas of the British Isles during the awful gales at the beginnin of last mouth was 340; and the number of persons who st their lives was 186. But it is, nevertheless, a verv gratifying fact that the number of lives saved on that giast occasion, chiefly by lifeboats and tholife-preserving apparatus, was 662. ln thi2 good work the lifeboats of that valuable society, the Bwoyal National Lifeboat Institution, performed a very impcortant paut, The lare number of lives thus raved already shows howr much suffering can be spsed by wrelldirected efforts in the preservaton of human life in cases of shipwreck.

The Peninsular Mails.
THE PENINSULAR MAILS.
SOUJTHI&MPTON, FEB. 14.
The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship M1adrid, Captain W. J. Tregear, arrived this morning with the mail
from the Peninsular ports, in charge of Lieutenant Pearson, R.N., her dates of sailing being-Gibraltar, February 5; Cadiz, February 6; Lisbon, February 9; and Vigo, February 10. She did not communicate with Oporto. The India mails left at Vigo by the Colombo were also brought home by the Madrid, in charge of Lieutenant Morris, R.N.
This steamer brings 33 passengers (of whom 13 are first. claas), 20 packages of specie (value 14,4931. sterling), and a cargo consisting of 58 chests of oranges, IL8 barrels and cases of lemons, 186 bales of orchila, 24 eases of dates, 5 casks of wine, 20 cases of eggs, 3 eases of animals, and 25 packages of general merchandise. She had strong breezes from the north and west, with heavy squalls of hail and rain.
The Lisbon letters are of the 9th inst. The Rouse of Deputies was still engaged in the debate upon the reply to the speech from the Throxe, and there was no doubt that the division would ultimately prove favourable to the Cabinet. The uinisters had declared to the Cortes that no Cabinet crisis existed in consequence of MI. Loureiro's re. signation, and that Count Lavradio's expected arrival from London had nothing to do with Ministerial arrangements.
The Lisbon exchanges for three months are quoted:London, 531; Paris, 540 to 538; Amsterdam, 41 ; Hamburg, 47; and Genoa, 526 to 525. On London, paper was over at 53k, and money at 534. The other rates were also falling. Some transactions had been made on Hamburg, Paris, and Genoa at quotations. The Stock.market was quoted-Portuguese Three per Cents., registered, in demand at 45k to j; Coupons, 44 to 441; and Deferred 241 to 24i; Bank of Portugal Shares, with dividend, at 517 to 520 railreis, in demand; as also Bank of Oporto Shares, at 19 to 20 per cent. premium.
A strong gale from the south-west was experienced at Lisbon on the night of the 8th inst., with thunder, lightning, andhail.
The Madridpassed the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Ripon on the 9th, off Cape Boca.
At Lisbon :-Her Majesty's ships Duke of Wellington, James Watt, Sanspareil, Exmouth, and Princess Royal; the French line-of-battle-ahip Austerlitz, and the usual Portuguese fleet.
Her Majesty's steamers Colossus, Conflict, and Caesar had left for England; the Sanspareil and Exmouth were to leave in a day or two.
The Gibraltar datesextend tothe5th inst. Exchangeson the 31st were quoted as follows :-London, 90 days' date, 50g . Paris, ditto, 5f. 32c.; Marseiles, ditto, 5f. 32c.; Genoa, ditto, 5f. 36c. ; Madrid, eight days' sight, 3 dis.; Caliz, ditto, par; Malaga, ditto, par; SeviUle, ditto, q dis.; Ali
cante, ditto, ; dis.; Valencia, ditto, i dis.; Barcelona, ditto, s dis.; Spanish pillared dollars, 93 to 10 per cent. premium; Carolus, 33 per cent.; Mexicans, 3 per cent.
The British bark Agenoria, A. Jackson master, from Constantinople for Cork, put into Gibraltar on the morn. ing of the 3 Lst ult., having been in collision with the French schooner FAise on the 24th, off Cape de Gatt. The schooner bad a cargo of barley on board, bound for Malaga. She sank when about 100 yards astern of the Agenoria, with a boy on board. The master of the Elise was unfortunately drowned in endeavouring to make for the bark, but four of the crew succeeded in getting on board and were taken to Gibraltar.
The British brig Vixen, from Cardiff, bound for Stora, put into Gibraltar on the 1st inst. with stanohions and bulwarks carried away.
The French brig Mlathilde, Captain Contel, from MarEeilles for Senegal, with a cargo of brandy, wine, rice, &c., was wrecked on the night of the 17th nlt., during a terrific storm, at a place called Baigal de Staigu, to the north of the island of Mahon. The vessel went to pieces, and all the cargo was lost. Only one sailor was saved out of the eleven persons who were on board the illf ated vessel, consisting of the master, crew, the owner of the cargo (M. Pons de Grosand), and his son.
The Portuguese brigantine Africano, Captain Duarte, with a general cargo for Bissoa, sprang a leak when five miles off Cape Spartel, but fortunately she fel in with the Dutch brigantine Vrow Maria, which took her in tow to Gibraltar-bay, where she sank astern of the American ship Sea Queen.
The British brig Marion, laden with wheat, which had put into St. Sebastian through stress of weather, was dashed to pieces against the new mole of that port on the night o the 21st nlt.
At Gibraltar, on the 5th inst., was Her Majesty's ship Curlew.

THu WESTmINSTSR BELIS.-The largest of the four quarter bells for the Westminster clock was cast last week at Norton, near Stockton, the birthplace of the great bell. It is pronounced to be of the intended note B, a fifth above the great bell, and an octave below the bell which was lately cast of similar metal by Me3srs. Warner from the same pattern, but of half the size and one-eighth of the weight, for the cast-iron clock, with the Westminster clock eseapement, made by bIr. Dent, of the Strand, for the Queen at Balmoral. The diameter of this bell iuslx feet exactly, and its weight wiUl be a little under four tons; it will therefore rank next to the great clock bels of Lincoln, St. Paul's, and .Exeter, and above those of Canterbury and Glocester, and oonsiderably above the tenor bells of the largest peals in England-Exeter, St. Mary-le-bow, and York Minster.

(Before the LOBDS JUSTICES OF AFPE'AL.)
The facts involved in this case were reported some days since in T7e Times. It came before the Court by way 'of appeal from a decision of Vice-Chancellor Wood granting an injunction to restrain the company from compulsorily taking the land of the plaintifQ, a landownier, containing 4 acres 2 roods and 24 perches, for the purpose of digging clay, in order to perform the works of the company, across Vinegar Middle. The appeal was argued by
3r. POLT and M1r. SCRRAOE for the company, Mr. DANIEL, Mr. T. STEVENS, and Mr. BENTINCIK for the respondent.
Their LoRDtusUPS coDsidered that the three special acts of Parliament passed for empowering the company did not enable them to take the land in question for any such pur. pose as they contemplated, and that therefore the appeal must be dismissed. The costs of the whole proceedings in this court and be'ow must be paid by the company, the appeal motion be refused, and the injunction made perpetual.
EX PABTE SAMUEL, rx RE SAM CEL.
Mr. CLEMF-NT SWVANSTON addressed the Court in this cape in support of the appeal of Mr. Lyon SamueL At the conclusion of his address
Lord Justice E-NIGHT BRUCE said, the application had been exceedingly well argued by this learned gentleman, and that indeed it could not have been better argued.
The circumstances under which the appeal was presented were very shortly these :-The bankrupt was the owner of certain valuable diamonds and jewelry, and before his bankruptcy he entrusted them, oralleged he enitrusted them, to a Mr. Diamond, and subsequently recovered part, and left the remainder with that person, and also lent him 3,0001., or thereabouts, to enable him to buy a forest somewhere in Moldavia from a Prince Schinass, but took no security for the money, although Diamond offered bills of exchange for the amount. The greater part of this statement was gi-ven by the baxlrupt in his examination before the commissioner, who remanded him to prison, adjourning his last exammation sine die. Re now petitioned for a reversal of the order and for bis discharge, and that a day might be appointed for the final examination.
Mr. Swanston and Mr. Clement SwanstOn were for the appeal. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Peteridorff (of the common laW bar), for the respondents, were not called upon.
Lord Justice KNICUT BRUCE and Lord Justice Tt-R-tim Coicui-red in thinking that the view of the commissioner was correct when he stated that it was impossible for any man in the possession of his niental faculties to believe the story w.hich the bankrupt had told regarding the disposal of the property in question, and that it was equally impossible to show that the assertion was untrue. The question was whether a rational human being could believe that story, and their Lordslips considered that no rational man could place the slightest reliance upon it. That the diamonds were ever delivered to Mr. Diamond was not an improbable story, nor was it an unfair inference that, if delivered at aU, they were so delivered for a fraudulent purpose. The story, however, of the disposal of the money to Diamond for the perpose sworn to by the bankrupt was plainly incredible, and
ad not a sbadow of foundation in truth. The consequence was that the petition must be dismissed with costs. EX PARTE MARCUS IN RE Tl}E ROYAL BRITISr BA NK.
Mr. BACON applied for and obtained leave to move for permission of this Court to appeal to the House of Lords against the decision of the Lords Justices dismissing the petition of Mr. Marcus to annul the adjudication in this case.
Their LORDSIIIPS gave leave to move on Tuesday morning.

In this case the information 'was filed for the purpose of having it declared that the claim of the Lord of the Manor of Stoke Newington to lev-y fines on the admission of trustees on the Court rolls as copyholders of certain charity lands in the parish of St. Mary, Stoke Newington, was unfounded, and of having a new scheme settled for the administrauion of the charity. The estate in question is worth about 3501. a-year, and the value is increasing. The income has always been applied to the repair and ornamentation of the church of St. Mary. In 1846 part of the parish of St. 2M rywas constituted into a district parish called St. Mathias, and in settling the new seheme the parochial authorities of St. Mathias claimed to participate in the income of the charity, a claim which was resisted by the parish of St. Mary.
His HONo,uR held that the parish of St. Mathias was not entitled to participate, but, under the circumstances, he should direct that the costs of all parties should come out of the charity funds.
Mr. Bevan appeared for the Attorney-General; Mr. Loyd, Mr. R. Palmer, Mr. Selwyn, Mr. C. Hall, and Mr. Brown for the other parties interested.

Mr. BAILY appeared in support of a petition in this suit, aslkng the sanction of the Court to purchase the schoolhouse and premises conaprising the Free Grammar School at Cheltenhamn, of 'which the president and fellows of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, are trustees. This charity was founded by deed by one Richard Pate in the time of Queen Elizabeth, and the premises are at present held upon lease, with a right of pre-emption to the college, who were alleged to be in possession of large property in which they were interested, as to two-thirds for the benefit of the charity, and as to tho remaining third as owners; and it was now proposed by sale or mortgage to raise money to make the purchase of the schoolhouse, &c., upon an affidavit that such purchase would be benefioial.
Mr. WicsEEs, for the Attorney-General, said that it appeared to him the only order which could be made at present was to approve the sale, and adjourn the matter to chambers as to how the purchase-money was to be raised.
The VICE-CHANCELLOR asked whether it was well estab. lished that the Court had jurisdiction to raise the money in the way asked? I
Mr. WzcKxxNs said that there was no doubt upon that point.

IN RE TUE ROYAL BRITISH BANK.-EX PARTE WALTON
AND RUE.
Mr. GiFFARD resumed the arguments on this adjourned summons on behalf of the executors of Charles Walton, 'who claimed to have properly transferred the shares belonging to the testator, the question being whether the terms set forth in the deed of settlement and charter of the bank with respect to the proceedings necessary to effect a transfer of shares had been complied with. It appeared that seven daya' notice was necessary under such deed and charter, and that the consent of the directors should be given to reconiuse and sanction such transfer. In the present case it was contended, on behalf of the official manager, that no consent of the directors had been given. It appeared that the practice had been for the transfor clerk to arrange all transfers, and there only appeared to have been nine entries of the consent of the directors having been obtained during the whole progress of the business of the bank. 'The transfer took place on the eve of the bank stopping payment, but it was now contended that the matter stood exactly upon the same footing as: an ordinary partnership. Where the matter was within the duties which the directors had to per. form, and other parties altered theirposition in consequence of some act of the directors, neither the company nor the directors could set up any charge of neglect on their part and the directors stood, 'with reference to the worfd at large and the people dealing with them as ordinary partners-" Bargate v. Shortridge," 5, House of Lords' Cases, 297 ; "Eastern Counties Railway Cornpanyv. Hawkes," ibid .381. If this transfer 'were held inyvlid, the effect would be that the executors of Mr. Walton would be liable to an action at law, and to repay the 7001. which had been paid for the shares to the nersons to whom they had transferred the shares. Any tracsaction within the power of directors, whereby another person was induced to alter his position, they were botnd Dy, and so was the company. The transfer therefore was valid, and the transferrees were liable as contributories. There was a difference between shareholders in a bank and shareholders in other 3ompanies under the Banking Ace, 7th and 8th Victoria, chap. U13, sec. 7.
Mr. BAILY and Mr. W. MORRIS appeared for Mrs. Hue. She was the holder of five shares, wbich were sold for 131. per share by her broker, in the ordinary way of business, on the oth of August last. Notice was given to the transfer clerk, and he filed it, and gave out a form of transfer, and the trnsfer was executed, and the purchase-money paid on the 30th of August. Mhrs. ue attended ameeting of shareholders on the 1st of A-ngust, and it appeared that the seven days' notice was waived. The usual practice when brokers sold was that, although the transfer clerk could do every. thing else, registration required the sanction of the direc. tors.
The case is stiU proceeding.

The plaintiffs in this action were Messrs. De la Rue and Co., the well known manufacturers of envelones, and the defendants, Messrs. Dickenson and Co., ere - entlemen engaged in the same department of manufacture he action was directed by tbe Court of Chancery to try the question whether the method of making envelopes adonted by the defendants wss an infringement of the lain patent of 1845, or of that obtained by hin in 184& It ap. peared that prior to the year 1845 envelopes were made n the following mamner :-A piece of paper, cut by a machine into the required shape, was Iaid upon what was termed a beda-viz., an oblong-shaped shallow box, A beavy plate, called a " plunger," was then made to de. cend upon the p%per, and forced it into the box. The
iaper was thus creased in an oblong sbape, and being taken out of the box it was folded by hand and gummed so as to form an envelope. On the 17th of March, 145, ,I! eours. Edwin HUIl and Warren De la Rue took out a patent for improvements in the manufacture of envelopes, and this patent embraced certain additions to and improvements of the above process, whereby the paer when creased was alo folded by the machinery. Thi was effected in the following manner :-Theu"blank t was laid uponvthelbox and pressed down by the " plunger;" h "plunger" was then raised, leaving the paperatthe bottomiof the box withais four fla s standing up verticaUly. By means of "caws" m a revolving axle, four triangularshiped metal folders attached by hinges to the sides of the box, were then made to fold down in succession upon the flaps of the envelope, and thus the "flaps" of the envelope were pressed down one aftr the other in the same manner as if they had been folded by the hum an hand. The bottom of the box was then made to rise and lift the envelope till it met a pair of ingers, which carried it off and deposited it in another place ready to he gummed. The claim made by the plaintiffs in their patent of 1845 was for the improvement which consisted in their so arranging nachinmery that the flaps of envelopes might be folded as above described. The next object was to perform the operation of gumming by means oi machinery. This was effected by Mr. c arren De la i ue's patent of the 19th of December, 1849. In his specification he stated thab he claimed, first, "the iap ly gm or cement to the flaps of envelopes wchartte faolned fy machinery on to each other in such manner that part of the process of folding of the flaps is performed before and part after the application of the gum or cement," and he also claimed "nthe appeiationx of gum or cement to the flaps of envelopes by apparatus in the
anner of suface printing, in contradidinction to the application of gumr or cement direct from a fountain or vessel contapining the fluid gum or cement." The mode in which the plaintiffs' two patents operatedl wasillustrated by setting the machine in motion, and so manufacturing envelopes in open court, the machine used for this purpose being the identical machine exhibited to the publichin the Great Exhibition of 1851. It manufactured about 40 envelopes in one at inute. The complaint now made against the defendants was that they had infringed both the plaintiffs' patents-the first by adopting a mode of folding the envelopes which was substantially the same as that patented by the plaintiffs on the 17th of March, 1845, and the second by adopting a mestod of applying the gum which was substantially the same as that natented by Mr. Warren Do la Rue on the 1thh of December, 1849. It appeared that on the 2 bth of August, 1849, a Frenchman named Ammdoe Frandois Remaod bad taken out a patent for "imaprovements in machinery for folding envelopes, and in the manufacture of envelopes," and the defendant had, been induced, in November, 1850, to purchase the patent of Remond for about 3,0001., on the assirance that it could be workedl without infringing on the plaintiffs patents. Remond's claim consisted, ftrst, of so "arranging machinery that paper suitably cut may be fed by atmospneric pressure into a machine capable of folding the same into envelopessa
afnd, secondly, "of causig paper cd into an envelope folding machine to be hel or pressed into a desired position bymeans of atmospheri pressure, soas to facilitate the folding of the flaps." Remond's method was this,-the shaped paper was laid on the "box" and pressed down by the "plunger," according to the process commonly used apnd adopted by the plaintiffs, but, instead of the folding by means of triangular-sbaped folders, as under the plain if'p n Remond adopted this method,-the " mthe bt o bng perforated, the passilng ack of the plung l pa r b ing thn mox itha the flaps standing upright mhie the ap were in thin statestrams of atmosephertsc air wher madetopass through the p erforated ides of thepbox so as to hold the aps of the envelope in a position inclined inwards, eso that, in the second motion of the plungar it shall cause al the flaps to be folded at once, the nteior and under surface of the plunger beingsuitably formed to cause the flaps to succeed each other iat he pro
order." It was contended, on the part of the plainr , that Remond in his patent did not claim anything more than-finrt, so arranging machinery that paper, suitably cut, should be fed bi tmoseric pressure into a machine capable of folding the amme into envelopes; and, secondly, calusing it to be held or pressed into a desired position by means of atmospheric pressuie, soas to facilitate the folding of the flaps. There was no claim at all made in Remond' patent for any new foldingapparatus ; and what was described io his specification, ut not claimed by Remond as his invention, wan not any novelty at all, but was in fact the same as the plaintilh foldiig apparatus. The process was substantially the same, "athe interior and under srace of the plunger" in lre. mood's p toet being nothing more than the metallic folders of theplaintifrs' patentofa 845. The process, itwasstated, wa nothing more than a mechanical equivalent andacolourable
imitation of the plainti' procewss. Severalpscientificwitnesses, " experts" as they are termed, were yesterday examined in support of this view of the case, including nessrs. Carp-
ntiel, May, owper, De il Rue (the plaintiff), and mchard. To-day several witnesses were caled for the defendants, in. cluding or. Newton, Ma. Aplegath (to whom Lord Camp-
lcel paid a handsome compl ment for the services rendered by him to the public, which his Lordship said we all en oyed), Mr. Dickenson (the defendant), and Mr. Edward Woods. These gentlemaen stated that in their opinion, Remond's invention was totally different from the plaintiff
and, in fact, had notbing analogous in it. With respect to thsecond question in issue, it appeared that the defendants had adopted a method of agpplying the gum to the envelope which was not claimed in Remond's specification, but of which the plaintiffs complained ts an infringement of Mr. De la Rue's patent of 1849, in which he claimed
cthe appiication of gum or cenent to the flaps of the envelopes by apparatus actin In theomanner of surface-printing in contradistinction tthapplication of gum or cement direct from a fountain or vessed containing the fluid gum or cement." In De la Ruie's machine there was a metallic rim which, having taken a certain quantity of gum from an endless apron Passing through a fountain of liquid gum, was made to trave forward and print the envelope withigum while in the proes of being folded, and the defendants had adopted the meth of raising a similar piecs of metal ndiubt fm the thoutalidy of gum, and printing it on the under side of the envelope before it was folded, and it was contended that this was a colourable imitation of Do la Rue's patent, which he described as "hthe application of gum to. the nla of the envelopes acting in the manner of surface pinting, in contradistinction to the application of gum or cement direct from a fountain or vessel containing the fluid gum or cement. pA good deal of evidence was
given on this point, and defendants showed that "surface printing was where the colouring or otherdimatter wa taken from a suface and afterwards printed on cotton, rslk, woollen, paper, or oilcloth, and that, in the defendants' process The gum was not applied "in the manner of surface printing," but by a piece ofa metal direct from the fountain, instead of by a sponge, as had formerly been used. It is but right to say that, whatever might be the case in regard to thecdefendanrts aehdine being an infringement of the plaintiffs' patent5 it seemed to be admitted that it was a very meritorious machineoand much more simple in its construction than the plaintiffs', and more effectual in its operation. The trial having lased two whole days,
Mr. Serjeant BYnassurmmed up the evidence for the defendants, and
Sir F. TAESIGER replied generally upon the whole case.
Lord CAmPBELl then asmed up the eviadence to the jury, and, in so doing, stated that there were two questions for their deciion-ion., whether the defendants hao infringed either or both of the Plaintiffs' patents. There was no doubt as to the validity of both the plaintiff patents; and the only question was whether either or both orfthem had been infringed. Thiat was a question of fact for the jury anda it was with sincere satisfaction his Lordship left that qustion to their decision, as he had observed that they had attended to the evidence with the greatest attention, as -well as to the able speeches which bad been addressed to themn by the learned counsel on both sides. Hlis Lordship said th question he should leave to the jury would be; whether the defendants' process was isubstantially the same as the plaintiffs'; or, whether any part of the process used by the defendants was substantially the plaintiffsa' process;for, if it was, the plaintiffs were entitled to a verdict. His' Lordship then went minutely through the various points in issue, and called the attention of the jury to the evidence of one of the principl witnesses on each aide, as bearing upon those points. &- Lordship advised the jury not to be carried away with the idea that, as there was great maerit in both, they should both remain as they were - but they must say whether or not, in their opimon, the defendants process was substantialy thu same as the plaintiffs'.

This was an action ucon a bill of exchange for 501., alleged to bave been drawn by one Ailler and accepted by the defendant, for the accommodation of a person named Wright, who endorsed it to the plaintiff. The defence to the action was that the acceptance was a forgery.
The plaintiff, who is a respectable tradesmag, is a trunkmaker at the corner of Coventry-street and the Haymarket; the defendant is a clerk in the General Post-office, and it appeared that the plaintiff had received the bill from Wright in rxcbange for 241 5s. in goods and the rest in cash; that Wright had told the plaintiff that he wanted goods for his brother; and that before the plaintiff took the bill, as he had never seen Wright before he went to his house to make inqniries about him. In order to prove the handwriting of the
efendant, Mier, formerly a clerk in the Post-office, was called for the plaintiff, andswore positively that he saw the defendant accept the bilL This witness admitted, on crossexamination, tbat he had gone through the Insolvent Court and that he used to be a betting man. Another witnems (Go-ald, now a commercial traveller, but who stated that he had been a clerk in the Post-office) said he thought the acceptance was in the handwriting of the defendant, and positively swore that he bad seen the defendant acoept another bill for 251. in one of the departments of the Post-office. It appeared, on cross-examination, that this witness also bad been through the Insolvent Court. Two other clerks in the Post-office (White, who stated that he had been clerk 39 years, and Gardener, who said he had been clerk 20 yeaes) said they believed the handw-riting to be the defendant's.
Forthe defence the defendant bimself was called, and swore that he had never accepted a bill of exchange either for 501., 251., or 601.; and, on cross-examination, said he had acceptedl one hill, and one only, for 151., on or about February 25, 1855. This witness was subjected to a long cross-examination. Among other things it appeared that his salary was 751. per annum, and that in 1856 he had banked with the Royal British Bank, and some cancelled checks of that bank were submitted to the jury for comparison of the handwriting.
X brother-in-law of the defendant, and seven or eight otber witnesses, principally clerks in the Post-office, expressed their opinion to be that the acceptance was not i- the defendant's handwriting.

The plaintiff is a baker in Bermondsey, whose father is possessed of several houses in Snow's-fields. The defendant is. th, proprietor of Bctls ifeiss, and this was an action to recover damages for a libel on the plaintiff which appeared iu tha t journal of the 27th of September last, in the shape of a letter, sig,ned - Robin Hood,"wherein the author, after descanting upon the hardships of the law of distress, proceededto illustrate his subject by the following narrative:-
"But leaving the question of right or wrong as it stands, I wil briefly refer to a case of such unmitigated cruelty recently perpetrated under the sanction of the law of distress, that, I think, if generally known, it would, in the language of Antony, make " the very stonesto rise and mutiny."
The affair, as related to me, was as follows :-My informant, in company with another person, having occasion to pass through now's-filelds, Bermondsey, in the afternoon of Saturday, the 30th of August, was attracted by a crowd in front of a dwelling belonging to one Curling, a baL-er in the vicinity, and occupied by a widow woman, who, by hard work and earnst efforts, had endeavoured for several years to support herself and two children; but, despite her industry, had unfortuatelyfallen into arrear with her landlord. The amount due was 31. 2s., and, at the moment my informant passed, the broker of the landlord was clearing off the entire property of the family to liquidate the demand. A mangle, by which she had maintained her children had been seized and sold, as weP as every article of furniture, except the bed upon which shelay spvehlvssand dyin,. This was required also, and it was insisted she should be moved from it. The barbarity of the act was so glaring that an individual present offered to pay 21. 2s. off the debt at once, and the poor neighbours undertook to pay the balance if a few days were allowed them to colleet it. But the offers were rejected, the work of destruction had commenced ; ' the law allowed it, and the landlord willed it,' and, moreover it was the broker's vocation and interest to seize all. Astretciher 'was sent for, the dying woman was lifted from her bed, placed upon it, and carried off to Bermondsey workhouse, where, in a few hours, she was placed in a pauper's shell and consigned to the grave.
" Here was a ease of murder as complete as if the wretch of a landlord and hs hell hounds had plunged a knife into her heart- a detah wantonly accelcrated-a ruin mercilessly determined on. Her children were yet to be disposed ofthe oldest of them, a boy of fourteen or fifteen, had oasession of the key of the house after it had been gtted by the Bermondsey Shylocks, and was advised by the neighbours to retain it. AS it was an object of the landlord to get possession of the premises, he offered the lad 1Os. to surrender the key, placing the money upon the counter before him ; the poor boy distressed, hungry, and homeless, consented to the bargain, and laid the key down by the money, when both were instantly seized by the ruffian or his wife, and the child was turned out of doors with half-a-crown, instead of half a sovereign. Here is fraud heaped upon cruelty. Should it not cry for vengeance against the oppressor of the widow and the fatherless ? Should not a law that sanctions such atrocities be instantly crasedfrom the statute book- I"
To the declaration the defendant pleaded not guilty, and that the hbel was trne in substance and effect. From the evidence of the plaintiff, his mother, a nurse named Smith, thebroker who made thedistress, and two medical men connected with the parish and the infirmary, it appeared that Mrs. Smith, the tenant alluded to inthelibel, had occupied a house under the plaintiff's father at 7s. 6d. per week, in Snow's-fields, for many years sincoher husband died, and that her eldest son Was 14 years old. As a means of eking out her scanty funds the widow kept a mangle, but for about seven or eight weeks before the 30th of Augnst last she fell into arrear with her rent, and moreover fell ill, so that she was confined to her bed and ultimately became bedridden. In thisstate of things akindneighbourandnamesake came to nurse the sick woman,and she, observing that she was sinkig, that her house was overrun with gossipping neighbours, who used her mangle for their own purposes, and, mocreover, that her little property was gradually disappear. ing, went to MIr. Curling, the plaiatiff, and made known the state of things, suggesting that if a distress were not put in there would very soon be nothing left. Upon thisM. Curling wrote tohis father; and on Thursday, the 28th, by his mother's directions, be' signed an authority to their breker to distrain for 31. 2s., but at the same time expresay enjoined him not to enter thebhedchamber oecupiedPby the tenant, or to touch any of the things in it. On that day the surgeon of the union visited the sick woman, and he determnined to remove her to the infirmary as soon as she was able to bear the change; and on Saturday he ordered her to be removed, as the only chance of sparmg or prolonging her life. On that day the broker, who had received the plaintiff's directions, removed the goods which he had seized, and they, oh the Siae, realised the rent all but Is. When he was removing the goods aneighbour stepped forward and offered 21. 2s. to redeem them, but the broker said he could not accept it, After the goods were removed the eldest son put a padlock on the door, and placed himself in communication with the plaintiff's mother on the Monday, when she agreed to give 1im 10s. for his mother's fixtures and Is. for the pdock, but claimed to deduct 7s. 6d. for the additional wee.s rent.

During the creditor's examInation of the insolvent a person named Guy handed to Mr. Towne a paper containing several statements, respecting which the creditor put questions.
The insolvent denied upon his oath that he had ever gone by any other name than Goulding. He had never been convicted at the Old Bailey, nor had he been in the policee under any other name than his own. lie had been in the police force in 18M, hut resinned. b hsCuti

The insolvent, upon loolding at the schedule, said he could not explain it. He rememberei nothing about it, and had never gona~ by that name.
Mr. Guy waa then questioned by the Court as to his motive for interfering, and admitted he had done to on account of the insolvent's conduct towards him in giving him into custody upon an unfounded charge, froom which he was discharged by the miagistrate. He was informed that the insolvent had been convicted, and that he had been in the olice as Gadsden.

MJrIDLESEX StSSIO1vS &turdacy, FC. 14.
(Before AMr. PAIsEY, Q.¢., Assistant-Judge.)
Henry Kent and John Pearson were brought up for judgment. Kent was convicted of having stolen 1801b. of Cavendish tobacco, the property of his master, a ,ghter. man1 from a barge on the river, and Pearson of feloiously receiving the same.
The AssISrAM-JUDGE said it was proved in evidence that Kent had been the constant associate of persons who carried on a systematic plan of robbery unon the river, several of whom had been convicted, which, in addition to the ircumstance of his being the servant of the prosecutor when the offence was cormmtted, made his case a very serious one, and he felt it his duty therefore to sentence him to six
p rvitude With respect to Pearson he thought u sseamuch more lenient sentence, after full consideration, although he was convicted as a receiver, and he should order that he be kept to hard labour for 15 calendar months.
Joseph Chubb Martin, convicted of a robbery from the person, after a number of previous convictions, was sentenced to six years' penal servitude.
George Harper, a lad, who was found guilty of stealing lead piping, wvas sentenced to three weeks' imprisonmsent, the nrst and last weeks to be solitary; and Richard Eagle. stone, marina storedealer, found guilty of receiving the same knowaing it to have been stolen, was sentenced to six years' penal servitude.
James Baker, a sailor, was indicted for unlawfaUy assaulting and wounding Thomas Stanley.
he proscator was a professional singer, and it appeared that on the evening of the 21st of January he was at the Jolly Sailors pnblichouse, St. George's-street, St. Georve'sin-the-East, where the prisoner was also, with several of his shipmates. A quarrel took place among the latter, and the prisoner left, and soon after returned with an open knife in his hand, declaring he would have his revenge on somebody, and seeing the prosecutor, who had not said a single word, standing by himself, he rushed at him with the knife still in his hand. The prosecutor hed up his right hand to ward off a blow; he sustained a wound, from which a good deal of bleod 'dowed, and the prisoner was given into custody.
The jury found him Guilty, and
*The ASsstsTA?T-JL)E now sentenced him to nine months' hard labour.
John Beens surrendered to take his trial uonan indictment for assaulting Ann Mosley, and for forcibly entering a certain house.
Mr. Ribton was counsel for the prosecution, Mr. Mfetcalfe for the defendant.
The charge of assault against the defendant arose out of n forcible entry of a cottage tenanted by the prosecutrix, under these circumstances:-The husband of the prosecutrix built six small houses in Constable-aUley, High-street, Horton, oneofwhich, that nowmorepartioularly in question, was called " Mosley-cottage." In the early art of ast year that was let to a person named Lofthouse, who relinquished the tenancy in October, and it was taken possession of by Mosley, who continued to live there until his death, which occurred soon afterwards. His widow remained in possession, claiming the cottage a her own under his wilL The
roperty, however, had been mortg ed in 1845 to the qaitable Provident Association, a bsequently to a solicitor. The interest of the association was ssigned to the latter, and in 1856, the property not being sufficient to Ray offtib principal and interest, it was sold hy public auction under the covenants of the mortgage deeds, aud the present defendant became the purchaser. Some proceedings were taken against Lofthouse, who was then in possession, but they feU to the ground, and when the prosecutrix was the tenant he went and took forcible possession; the furniture was thrown out, and blows struck The learned counsel for the prosecution opened his case that if the defendant had a rightful claim to the property there was a simple mode of obtaining possession legaUy, and he had no right to go and by force turn out the tenant in possession of his own accord. The deeds proving the defendant's title were produced in court. He
ad remained in pssession.
After the case had been gone into it was arranged that the defendant should plead * guilty" to two counts of the indictments, then to take the proper legal steps in the matter,
The AssisT xT-JuDGE directed that possession should be restored to the prosecatrix at 4 o'clock on Monday, and the defendant was bound in a recognizance to appear next
Mr. hTCAjX said his client was in possession of the five other cottages, and he held them under the same titl3. There was no question as to the property being his.
Mmrs. Cobbett, a lady not altogether unknown in all the superior law courts, was present, and seemed interested in the case, but for what reason was not stated. She expressed a wish to be heard with reference to something which was stated in court by Mdr. Metcalfe, on Thursday, when the case was being mentioned.
The CO1mT could not hear her.
Mr. hlETcALFez said he mentioned on Thursday thatXrs. Cobbett had something to do with the matter. The learned gentleman produced the folowing letter, which he had received from the Qaeen's Prison :--

From information obtained by the police, it appeared that the prisoner was well known to Arthy, the man who personated sO many noblereen and gentlemen, and defrauded so many tradesmen by that plan.

WESTIMyNSTER.-In the case against Mr. Betts, a butcher at Knightsbridge, for assaulting the police, which had been adjourned that the depositions might be prepared to send it before a jury, Mr. David Power attended on behalf of defendant, and, without in any way t 'npromising his witneses, expressed defendant's deep regret as a man of high respectability, at having, while under the influence of liquor, come in any way into collision with the
oiace, and entreated the magistrate, if he felt he could, to ulwith it summarily,
Mr. ARNOLD firmly refused to yield to the application wbich had been conveyed in the most conciliatory terms. Be observed that, if the evidence of defendant's witnesses was trustworthy, the constable had grossly misconducted himself by doing all he could to provoke and irritate a drunken man in the first place, and by groesly exaggerating and misrepreeenting the facts in the second. The case was of extreme importance to the general administration of justice in polce-courts. The charge was very serious in so far as, according to the constable's statement, the assault upon him was utterly unprovoked, and was about, from its character, to be visted upon defendant by committal for 10 days, which would mostassaredlyhave beencarried into effect but for the conflicting testimony subsequently produced. He was bound to say he felt so much doubt that he should send the case before a jury, to decide which party should be believed.
The case was then formally completed for the sessions, the defendant's recognizances being extended for his appearance.
Wosslr-smExT.-Charlotte Sabine, a wnman of ladylke appearance, dressed in deep mourning, and attended by a nurse carrying an infant, was charged before Mr. D'EI-cou;T with obtaining money under false pretences,
Ellen Kensuy, a housemaid, said,-I know the prisoner who gets her living, I beheve, by telling fortunes. Last night, about 7 o'clock, I went to her residence, and asked, as I was instructed to do, for "the good lady." I was shown upstairs, and waited in a room upon the first floor for some time, when I told the attendant that I was in a hurry, and I was therefore shortly after shown into the drawing-room, where I found the defendant. I said I wished to have my fortune told, as indeed I had said to the attendant at first. Defendant produced a pack of cards, or part of a pack, and told me to cat them. I said I did not know what she meant, and the defendant showed me how. I cut the cards three times, and she laid them out in a row and began telling my fortune. The principal things she told me were, that my mother was abont to dio shortlv that I shoald then have much money, but that I shoudd
a mother before I was a wife. She told me shameful things besides those, and likewise said that my mistress owed me money, and that I should have a great deal of trouble in getting it.
Mr. D'Er-coUP.T.-And is it true that your mistress owes you money?
Witness.-No, I am a servant, but my mistress eoes not owe me anything. When I left I gave her a shilling, vhich had been previously mark-ed by the police.
Sergeant Evans, of the G division.-By direction of Inspector Cole, to whom complaint had been made, I attended last evening at the prisoner's residenco, and when the last witness had left I went up to the first floor, having also obtained admission by asking for "the good lay." I did not tell the prisonerl .wanted my fortune told, but proceeded to busness at once by accusing her of tolling fortunes. She said " Yes, I do ee a few friends now and then, but I make no charge." I aaidd"You have just receivod a shiling," and she said, " XYes, here it is; she would not take the change." Both the rooms I saw were very well furnished, and I conveyed her at once to the station.
Mr. Docoroy Young.-I am a surgeon in Old-street, and the prisoner, upn respectable references, engaged my drawmvgroom floor. A person whom she alleged to be her husband was occasionally seen, but it shortly after, to my
bi reat an ae, came to my knowledge that she was in the n t of toig fortunes, and, as that was a disgrace to the neig=hbourhoo, and calculated to seriously affect me in my profession, I conslted the police about it, that I might get rid of my lodgers as speedily as possible.
Mr. D'EYicouRt.-Had she many visitors of this description ?
Witness.-Oh, yes, I have known as many as from 12 to 15 persons cal daily; they were mostly ladies, and obtained ad on to her on these visits by asking for " the good ld ." When I let her the apartments I let them to her =uainshed.
The defendant, who kept incessantly weeping, and had frequently called out that the proceedings had been taken agaist her unfairly, here became much excited, and exclaimed, " Mr. Young sent the girl with the shilling to do mean injury. It is nothing but spite; he wanted to attend me in my accouchement, and directly he heard I had engaged Mr. Love he proceeded in this way. I am a married woman, living with my husband, have four children, of whom the one in court is the youngest, and that is but one month old. We have been locked up in a ceU all night."
Mr. D'EYNCOURT.-But what do you say to professing to teU fortanes, and receiving a shiling of the first witness ?
Defendant.-Yes, I did tell her fortune, and when she was leaving and gave me the shiling I told her " Now, my good garl, it you cannot sare this don't give it to me." I was then about to give or change, bu she said " No, I may want it told again, and that will pay for both." I wish my nurse to be heard,
Rebecca Newton.-I have nursed the defendant, and this is the baby, of which she has been confined only a month, I last evening let inthe first witness, who ask-ed for " the good lady," and I heard her say that she wanted her fortune told. I neither saw nor heard her fortune told. I waited outside the door to show the girl out, as I do all vidtors.
By Mir. D'EYNCouRT.-I have known many persons, perhaps dozens, apply for " the good lady" in a day, and I thought that most of them had come to visit her in her illness.
Mr. D'EyvcousT (to the defendant).-Where do you come from?
Defendant (sobbing).-I come from Norwich and my husband from Portsmouth. I should not have done this but for his illness He is afflicted with consumption, and has been both in the Brompton and Victoria Park Hospitals,
Mr. D'EYNCoUT.-YouLareliable to be imprisoned for three mouths' as what is termed a rogue and vagabond, and,-
Defendant (clasping her hsnds).-Oh, forgive me; I never did an injury to any one. I meant no harm, and PI never do so again.
Mr. D'EYNCouRT.-Very preat mischief is done by persons pursuing such a course of life as you admit that you have practised, and there is no doubt whatever that many persons m this district have parted with their money to you in this foolish and credulous manner. I shaU send you for one month to the House of Correction, and, had it not been for lour recent illness, I would most assuredly have sent you ror tre
The defendant burst out crying very bitterly, promised notto repeat the offence, and begged for a more lenient decision but the magistrate refused to alter it, and she was removea to the cell, still in tears. Mr. Young indignantly denied that there was the slightest foundation for the motive the prisoner imputed to him.
TAIrs.Chsrles Lambert, alias Delafosse, a mnsician, aged 40, and wearing a moustache, and Elizabeth Lanbert, hlss wife, a thin, careworn-looking woman, about
te same age as her husband, were brought up on remand before MKr. SErLvy; charged with stealing four cases of draw-^ing and mathematical instruments, the property of gentlemen studymg at the Military College at Addiscumbe. in
There was another charge against thie female prisoner of robbing her ready-fvaied lodgings, No.4, Hannibal-road, Stepney, of sheets, pillows;, blankets, and other property, upon which charge she was arrested and examined on Friday afterno, but that case, from some cause unexplained, was not entered into on Saturday.
The prsoner said that what his wife did was done entirely under d directions.

was doing so Porter rnshed into the private bar-parlour and fel down, apparently in a fit. He struggled, Licked, and foarned at the mouth, and the landlady, Mrs. Rix, had much trouble in saving a table covered with glasses from being capsized. As Murphy and Rayner went into the bar-parlnor under pretence of rendering assistance a scene of great confusion ensued, and in the midst of it a large drawer was opened, and the caahbox, containing a 501.-note, four 51-, notes, and 281. 10s. in gold, was taken out. Mrs. Rix called out, "My cashbos is gone," and Murphy dropped it near where Porter was lying when the theft was discovered. The Man in the fib was taken into the taproom, and recovered directly, and the vigilance of Mxs. Ux prevented the men carrying out their nefarious design. F,rter and Murphy were at once given into custody, and Rayner tendered his services to the proseoutrix to give evidence against them, but he disappeared before the parties reached the station-house. He was arrested on Saturday by Deeble, a police-constable, who said, " I want You for stealing a eashbox," on which the prisoner observed, " Oh, I suppose I shall get the same punishment as they, and am as innocent asthey.' He was positively identified by 3M
Rir and by a young woman named Mary Blaney, who said the prisoner worean imperial and full whiskers on the 9th nt. Te imprialhad dsapp are iad his whiskers had been greatly thinned. p1 hikt
I The prisonerin defence said,-I resemble the guilty party.
Mr. SELFE.-How do you know you resemble the party f you were not there?
The Prisoner.-The women have told barefaced falsehoods. The man had no imperial, and not full wlhiskers.
Mr. SZLFE.-Don't make such assertions as these, if you were not there.
The prisoner was committed for trial.
Mr. SELFE has received 5s. from a " Poor Governess," Torquay, and 2 6dO. from " E. C.," for the poor-box.
L MIB -Edwin Thompson, Mary Anm Sage, and John Hyde, who have been in custody since the middle of December last on a charge of being concerned in an extensive robbery on the premises of Mr. Edward Harris Rabbits, a boot and shoo manufacturer in the Wal worth-road, and stealing therefrom boots and shoes to the amount of 1201., were tmaly examined before the Hon. G. C. NoBTo2. The prisoner Hyde is a man of considerable property.
There is a curious incident connected with the robbery wbich is supplied by a ersn named William Child, who had been a city officer, but who seems from his own account to be a sort of poNee agent. This person said, " On the eveninSof the 1Oth of December (the night of the robbery) I saw t n prisoner Thompson, and in the course of conversation he told me there was going to be a crack in the Walworth-road, at a shoo warehouse. Isaid, 'How are you going to manage that job I' He said, ' They are going through theroof andwdrop down into the warehouse. They wanted me to be an insider, but I would not, because I had worked there, and if I was to get nailed I should get copped.' I asked him the name of the place, but he would not tell me. Ie said it was to have been dono before, but they could not get a drag, and that there were three of them in it."f
The prisoners were commaitted for trial

(FROM OUR OWN 00RMSPONDWT.)
NE W YOMRK JAN. 31.
b4r. Buchanan, the President elect, is at present I -*naking a short visit to Washington. He arrived 'there on the 27th, and took up his quarte,rs at the National Hotel. It is understood that he is taking a general survey of political parties in situ, and arranging with Mr. Pierce for assummng possession of the White House on the 4th of Moxrch. He has abundance of visitors; and, it is said, hears *' patiently all suggestions concerning the new Administration ;" but is very oes d on the subject, and generally puts "a damper upon obtrusive counscl.' He will return to his heme at Wheatlands, Pennsylvaniv, next week, anrd there, assisted by his latest observations at Washin-ton,-of which, as ;n old politician, he had before a thorough and intimate knowledge,-he will appoint his 'Cabinet. Mr. Buchanan's caution on this matter lias completely baffled political speculators, and they Ahave lately quite ggivent up their prospective con-structions of the new Administration.
The business of Congress has been interrupted ;or two days by the sudden death of a member of -the House of Representatives who had acquired an -unfortunate celebrity. Mr. Preston S. Brooks, of South Carolina, died suddenly at Brown's Hotel on 'the evening of the 27th. A cold, from which he -was recovering, was followed by croup, a violent attack of which terminated his existence in 10 minutes. It is the custom of the American legislature to adjourn on receiving information of the death of a member of either House; *a series of cloges are pronounced by the personal and political frierds of the deceased, and resolutions passed, expressing the regret and sorrow of the two Chambers. Mr. Brooks's death was announced in both Houses on the 29th. In the Senate brief addresses were made by Mr. Evans, Mr. Llunter, and Mr. Toombs; in the Lower House, by Mr. Xeitt, lMlr. Quittman, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Clingman. The one fatal act that made Mr. Brookss name known to the world-the assault on Mr. C. Sumner in the Senate House-could not be alluded to on such an occasion by his friends; that the friends of Mr. Sumner were silent -was a matter of course; but a Mr. Savage, a Southern member, was ill-advised enough to introduce the Esbject everybody else avoided, and to speak of that iunhappy incident with the most -decided admiration. He compared it to the assassination of Cesar by Brutus in the Capitol, a deed, .he said, that has ever since " been approved and applauded by the world." There is great peril in this system of obituary orations unless they can be managed discreetly; it requires much tact to avoid -what is not fitting to say, and the lives of fierce political partisans furnish abundance of material for -omission. Any step beyond the line of pious generalities is unsafe; and, as Mr. Savage was not among the nunber of the friends of the deceased member who it was arranged should speak, his display is strongly condemned on all sides. It did not provoke any rejoinder, or a scene mioht have ensued that would have gone far to put an end to the custom of delivering such orations altogether.
The United States' steamer Illinois arrived here on the 28th from Aspinwall with mails and passengers from California. The British mail steamer Thames arrived at Aspinwall from San Juan del YNoate on the 19th, and enabled the Illinois to bring some further intelligence of the state of affairs in Nicaragua. Before the Thames left San Juan accounts had been received that W'alker, who was last heard of at Rivas, had been compelled to abandon that place and take refuge at St. George or San Jorge, a little town on the shore of the Lake, -opposite the Island of Omotepe. IHe is there shut in by the Central American forces, with only 500 men and destitute of provisions, and with no meaas of obtaining them by water, as all the aiver and lake steamers have been captured. This is the Costa Rican account, and describes Walker's position as desperate enough, though not much more so than was supposed to be from the last reports. Some further details are given of the expedition by which the forts on the San Juan and all the river steamers were seized. It appears that Spencer was only the agent employed to cmrry it out; it was -planned by a Alr. Webster, an Englishman, and managed with such complete secresy that, when the body of troops commenced their march, only three -persons in the Republic knew their destination-Mr. Webster, President Mora, and Mr. Anderson, an :English merchant in Costa Rica. It also appears that Walkerwasenabledtosend aforcetorelieve Henningsen from the trap he had got into at the Guadaloupe church, and that Henningsen hiinself only escaped by the blunders and squabbles of the allied commanders, in whose hands the miost evident chance -of success is liable to turn into failure. When Henningsen was burning and demolishing Grenada with 400 or 500 men, the Central American force, 'inder Zavala and Belloso, was 1,700 men. After
lenningsen refused to surrender, during his retreat to the shore of the lake, though the shattered remnant of his force was reduced to little more than 100 men, Zavala wished to storm his post and decide the matter at once; but Belloso refused to do it. There was a quarrel between the two generals, and Belloso coolly walked off with the 1,200 troope of his command (the Sau Salvador contingent), leaving Zavala with only Z00 men. This was " one of the things of Spain," by which Walker has been so constantly assisted during the whole of his career. It accounts for the otherwise inexplicable fact of the assaults en Henningsen's positions growing fainter as his strength visilsy diminished, and for his final esc4pe with only (60 men out of the 500 he had at Grenada. This was not all; Zavala, deserted by his ally, sent for General Canas, who was at Ri vas -with 600 men to reinforce him, and on his departure WaLkerseizedthe place andkeptit for sometime, but has now been compelled to abandon it, it is said - on account of disease and the want of water, the wells being poisoned bythe number of dead bodies thrown into them. He is now at San Jorge in much the same position as Henningsen in the Guadaloupe Church, his chief hope being in some inconceivable blunder on the part of his enemies which may extricate him. If -one rumour brought by the present mail prove correct, it seems as if the desertion of Belloso had been proraptly punished; his *sudden death by cholera was reported; but it was believed he had been shot by sentence of a courtmartiaL There are fierce feuds and hatreds between -the Central American fictions, which late events have increased, as the " Chomoristas" accuse the Leonese of beiug the cause of the destruction of Grenada by inviting the Americans to Nicaragua. The agent for that republic in New York, a Major Bradley, in a public notice -denies the truth of the above accounts; he says they are false and manufactured here; but, as some -of the details are confirmed in letters that are certainly not home-made, the contradiction ir not worth much. The intelligence, discouraging as it is, did not prevent the -usual number of recruits sailing by the Tennessee .steamer on the 29th.; they were collected by the usual promisee of land; grants and other unknowm advantages. The Tennessee also carried some arms, ammunition, e'nd stores. On this occasion the Federal auathiorities, with very un-expected vigilance, are-sted seven or eight persons on the charge of enlsting men "to go beyond the limits and jurisdictio-m of the United States," -and issued warrants against 16 others. Some of those in custody have bee_ released on bail, but one 4of them, a Colonel Faben4. formerly the American -commercial agent at Greyto-rn, refused to give any,
an order to Drn2g the question to an issue sooner, And is now in Eldridge-strfet gaol. No attempt was made to prevent the departure of the vessel, -which ill1 thu3, in all probability, convey some acceptable pupplies. Walker's friends ,ought to look on the tardy- interference of the United
States' Marshal as a bad omen. Nothing of the kind was attempted while he wag in prosperity.
The peril to which the States -of ;Spanish origia are exposed fron such invasions has hastened a movement of defence againlst them. The republics of Chili, Peru. and Ecuador have firmed a treaty of alliance, or a kind of confederatioe for internal
improvements and externam defence. The independence of each State is stringently proteted, and no internal commotions are to furnish a ground
of action to either of the other contracting parties; but by the 15th article all invading expeditions against either of the three States, not authorized by a regular foreign Government and under commission from them, vill be eonsi&ered
piratical, and any persons taking part in the'm
treated as pirates or banditti. The several Stateo ore to contribulte in fair proportions to the expense
~of xeelsting such inroads on the common territory. he ti aty is an anticipatory defensive league of
three iSpanish South American States against Fili-
busterism * the group of republics north of the isthmus o{staen is uow F compelled to form the
same kind of coalition, very imperfectly, in the midst of war. The League wil, probably, be joined by Brazil; and its adoption will at the first favourable period, be urged on the independent Spanish States on the northern division of the continent. This germ of a confederacy may nict have any very immediate expansion; but it marks the first decided movement towards reunion
since the great convulsion that broke up the vast 1 colonial monarchy of Spain into mstlch numerous fragments. Walker may really hav had a mission, if not the one he believed in.
The papers are filed with wanouncements of 'wreck and disaster along the wkole of the American coast, and every mail adds to the list. The storm of the 19th of January and the heavy gales that succeeded it appear to have extended from Maine to Floridaandhalf wayacross the Atlantic. The Canadianjournals are makingmerryover the outcryraised by the New Yorkers about the nine daya' burial of their State under snow and the consequent inconveniences. Canadians, they say, would have thought it amere passing shower; but those hardy Northerners-those next neighbours of Greenlandshould recollect we lie at the gateway of the sunny South, and are not inured rega. larly to such visitations. It is the caprices of this more soutbern latitude that perplex the people, who have to defend themselves periodically against the heat of the tropics and the cold of Siberia; they may be buried tunder seven feet of snow after a summer alarm of yellow fever. No season is steady to its character. Winter in Canada is a firmly enthroned despot, sure of his power and holding his sceptre firmly. You may be confident he wiU descend to no undignified trickery, and there is comfort in the security under him. Winter here is more the Oriental tyrant, with a disputed throne and doubtful authority, iickle and treacherous, no one knowing what he may do next-the most insufferable kind of despotism. He may overwhelm us with an avalanche, suspend all human life for the better part of a fortnight, and lower the thermometer to a point almost impossible to believe inr; then suddenly produce a January thaw, wet enough to cover everything with ice if it freezes, and then resume the thawing process, and carryit on till weare half leg deep in a black mixture neither quite snow nor wholly mud, through which New York is wading dismally at this moment. These changes are not fancied; they have all occurred within the past week.

NEW YORK, FEE. 4.
The Cunard steamer America, that was to have sailed from Boston on the 28th of January, was frozen into the harbour, through the solid ice of which a channel 12 miles long had to be cut for her, from the wharf to the open sea. The operation delayed her one day, and she did not leave till the 29th. The City of Manchester, a Liverpool and Philadelphia boat, on arriving at the latter port on her last trip, found herself frozen out. The harbour of Philadelphia was closed by the hard frost, and the City of Manchester had to put into New York. These mishaps to the harbours of two other States were not deplored at New York as deeply as they ought to have been; they were taken as the text for a little self-congratulation on possessing the only great harbour on the coast not affected by the rigour of winter. But winter was not over, and on Saturday last, January 31, as if to rebuke us for triumphing over our neighbours, the Collins steamer Atlantic was stopped by the ice, and did not get to sea till the following day, February 1. She had not to be cut out from her wharf certainly, but met a Seld of drift ice at the quarantineground which she could not force her way through, and was compelled to wait till it dispersed. Philadelphia might, it is said, have been kept open if the merchants had made the same exertions as those of Boston, who employed steamers to ply day and night in the channel to prevent the ice fixing, and resolved at any cost to open a way for the steamera to Europe. In this respect the Bostonians showed grcat spirit, and fairly conquered the obstacle. New York has had no need to make such exertions by sea; but on shore the state of the city shows that a little of the same activity on the part of the public would have prevented a great deal of suffering. It is perhaps lucky the harbour did not freeze up, for, to judge from the general apathy as tol any measures iof protection, no effort would have been made to keep it open.
The thaw of the last day of January has been succeeded by a sharp frost, and except where the shopkeepers in self-defence clear the walks the city is a cake of ice.
The Persia, which sails to-day, bringps only two days' later news, the Atlantic ha, tken an extra mail made up during her detention. The two days have not been prolific of events. The winter is evidently still supreme in the interior, and everything is suspended, like the music of Munchausen's horn. We shall hear all together as soon as we have a permanent thaw.
3Ir. Buchanan left Washington yesterday. The expectants are reported to be, on the whole, very disappointed by his adherence to the doctrine of " non-committal" as to his appointments. He was subjected to a good deal of pressure, but nothing satisfactorv was elicited. The only point on which he expressed a decided opinion is described to have been the weather; he coincided with several parties in pronouncing it "detestable." His great difficulty is to find a successor to Mir. Marcy as Secretary of State. The public would be very well contented if some old personal and political differences could be got over so as to allow Mr. Marcy to remain. He kept the present Administration from going to pieces, and is personally popular and respected ; but there are so many claimants of office under a new President, though drawn from the same political party as the old one, that a double term of possession is almost an impossibility. Nevertheless it is rumoured that Mr. Buchanan has considered whether it is quite an impossibility in Mr. Marey's case. His retaining his post would relieve the President elect froma much embarrassment.
TheSenatedebatedthenewtreaty'withEnglandyes- terday forthree hourswithout coming to any decision. Treaties, and the question of accepting or rejecting them, being a part of the executive function of the Senate, are discussed in secret session. Strong doubts are expressed whether the treaty wil obtain the support necessary to ratify it.
Political matters have been superseded in interest in New York by one of those terrible murders that stand out with awful distinctness in the annals of crime. The last steamer probably brought the announcement, as the first details of the deed were published on the morning of the lst; but the account could give no ideaof the excitement that has since extended over the whole city. A Dr. Harvey Burdell was found during Saturday, the 31st of January, dead in his room, at 31, Bond-street, strangled, with 1l
stabs in different parts of his body. The murder must have been committed in the night of Friday, the 30th, but no alarm was heard in the house. There had been no forcible entry, and, as no property upon him or in the room was touched plunder could not have been the obIect. The
deceased was a surgeon-dentist, in good practice; he was wealthy, and the house, in one of the best streets in the city, was his own. As suepicion from the first did not extend beyond the house itself every inmate of it was put under arrest as a beginning, and the coroner's inquiry, although it
has not yet fixed the guit on any one person, has revealed a state of things in that one dwelling unrivalled in any roinrce. Burdell was the owner of the house and lived in it, butt was not its master. He had in an evil hour become acquainted with a " watering-plaoe" widow named C unningham, cruising at Saratoga znd elsewhere, to whom the wealthy baehelor fell a prey. He installed her in the house, first as a lodger only, next as tenant she established tAere a lover, who became lord of the establishmext, and two daughters, one of whom introduced a lover into the pre. mises also. While living in the house the widow brought an action against the doctor for breach of promise of marriage, whfch he compromised by a written promise of constant fiendship," andsomething moredefinite-.a lease of' tAi house. Then comes the m ost extraordinary pirL of the transactions. A few days after the aet,on was put an end to the widow procured soi?S man to perso.iate the doctor, and to thlt man, whoever he was, was regularly married in October last by the Minister of the - Dutchl Reformed church. While obtaining, as far as the law
and registerd are concerned, the position of i3urdell's wife, he, quite unconscious of the singular fraud, lived on very bad terms with her and the whole of the inmnates she had gathered ronnd him; there were constant quarrels, and gradually he felt such fear and hatsred of the woman, or some of those about her, that he expressed to a friend his terror that something would happen. He said, however, he was always armed, and would "rough it out till May," when he had taken legal steps to put an end to the occupancy or the lease. The foreboding of the unhappy man was realized- on the night of the 31st of January, without any previous threat or quarrel stronger than the ordinary indications of ill-will, he was murdered.
'he present supposition is that the man who personated Burdell, and was married in his name to the woman Cunning,ham, was her paramour, living in the house-a man named Eckel. The minister who performed the ceremony fully identifies the woman, but cannot speak so confidently of the man. He thought at the time he had false whiskers on, but the suspicion was not strong enough to induce him to make any remark. Dly the aid of a wig and these false whiskers it is believed Eckel passed himself as the deceased on the occasion, so that for some months Burdell had been living with the man who had been married to his own tenant in his own name. The evidence on this point reads more like a bit of audacious comedy than the horrible tragedy it has turned out to be. The plan was deeply laid, and, could Burdell have been got rid of quietly, would in all probability have succeeded. On the proof of the marriage being established-and the certificate and evidence of the clergyman would have been conclusive-the widow, in the name of Burdell, would have claimed a third of the deceased's property, which amounts altogether to 100,000 dollars. The previous action for breach of promise, and the terms on which the parties were known to have been, would have explained the n-arria'e; and the question of the personal identityof the deceased would not have been raised. Such a singular complication of affairs as that in Burdell's house could not have gone on long without discovery, but what hastened the blow Is not known. The intention of the murderer appears to have been frustrated by a desperate resistance on the part of the victim. The attempt to strangle him must have failed, and the knife been used in a violent struggle. Whether his death was meant to appear as a suicide, or how it would have been explained, can only be conjectured; one supposit5on is that the body would have been placed in the street, to be found " garotted," that mode of robbery having lately been extensix ely practised in New York. But the garotters never mangle their victims in so frightful a manner. No attempt had been made to remove or eonceal the body, which was fouhd while the rest of the family was at breakfast, by the doctor's boy, who did not live in the house. The inquiry has discovered motives enough for the murder, but as to whose hand committed it there is yet no evidence, nothing but suspicion that points at the man Eckel. The excitement this murder has caused is very great among all classes, and for the moment nothing else is thought or spoken of. Not the least singular part of the inquiry is the mode in which it is conducted; the coroner into whose hands it has fallen is evidently incapable of the duty, and degrades his functions by indecent jesting with the witnesses. The legal offices of the city must be falling into hands likely to make the administration of the law an utter farce; and as long as the " right stripe" in politics supplies the place of all other qualities, and covers the want of them, it will continue to be so; but the present spectacle is absolutely humiliating. When the system of electing the judicial officers does secure an efficient man, as in the recent choice of Judge Russell, the simple surprise and gratification of the New-Yorkers is almost amusing, as if the judges were selected by a lottery, and hitting on a man of talent and energy was a lucky chance, equal to drawing the great prize. There are many such men, but they will not wade through the dirty waters of politics to reach the bench, where they have only a short tenure and lender pay. The emoluments and credit of private practice are much greater than those of the official position.

Sir John Franklin's Expedition.
SIR JOHiN FRA NKLIN'S EXPEDITION.
TO THB EDITOR OF THE TMES.
Sir,-I lose no time in noticing the report given in 17&e imes and other papers of to-day by Captain Sherard Osborn in reference to Sir John Franklin's expedition, and to mention that no information bearing upon this important sibject has reached this house in an official or private shape, and that, in the opinion of persons acquainted with the Lndian country, it is only one of those vague rumours which have been current there from time to time, upon which no reliance can be pla^ed, and probably arises from Indiang having seen one of Anderson's own encampments on or near the Back River, but not near its mouth, because the Indians, as far as is known to the Hudson's Bay Company, never approach within 200 or 300 miles of it, ie.-the mouth of the river.
Sir George Simpson, whose name is particularly mentioned byCaptain Osoorn, will be in London next week, and wiU no doubt personally contradict the absurd charge made in Captain Osborn's communication.
I am, Sir, Your obedient servant.

The Parks As They Will Be.-The dismal
THE PARKS AS THY WiLL BE-The dismnal appearance which St. James's Park has put on for the last four months is beginning to improve, and the scene gives some token of what may be expected when the extensive works in operation shall be brought to a conclusion. Nearly the whole of the bed of the lake is now drained and levelled, and in the course of five or six weeks, when the present artificial bottom has wel settled, the whole will be covered with concrete, which it is anticipated will effectually prevent the growth of vegetable matter, and wiU give an easy means of cleansing the whole. Were it not for the new bridge across the lake the works would soon be brought to a eonclusion; but on digging the foundation for the abutments such a mass of springs has been tapped that it has been necessary to keep three steam engi es continually at work ia order to form anythin like a solid bottom. This influx of water has necessitated the keeping open the cutting which runs on the north side of the lake, and which cannot be filled in until the foundations of the bridges are completely settled. The erection of a suspension-bridge is of a more difficult character than the generality of persons imagine. People see the abutments of the bridge, and chains passing over them, which support the roadway, bat they are not aware of the difficulty of finding means of keeping these chains firmly and securely attached. The mawus opercandi to the uninitiated may thus saccinctly be described :-At some distance beyond the extreme end of the bridge a deep excavation is made, below even the foundation of the abutments of the bridge. At the bottom of this excavation an inverted arch, of the strongest material, is constructed, the interior and exterior of which are filled and surrounded with Portand cement. This forms the table on which the principal stone rests, to which are attached the chains. Three blocks of granite are then placed above this stone in such a manner that, without disturbing the whole, it is impossible to move the keystone in the shghtest degree. Above and around these blocks of stone are some 700 or 800 tons of the strongest blue lias concrete that can be made. This, in fact, forms one solid mass of stone, so that it is physically impossible the keystone can be started. The chains thus fixed passthrough a small tunnel, called the chain tunnel, and thence over the abutment of the bridge to the other side, where they are similarly attached. This seems easy enough on paper, but it requires a good deal of engineering skill to carry it out properly. With respect to the brndge ia question arather curious circumstance occurred. In digging the foundation the excavators came upon a solid bed of peat some 10 feet in thickaess, and at the bottom was found a layer of green moss, in which was imbedded, in a capital state of preservation, the antlers of a fine buck, which have been carefully preserved as a curiosity. As regards the bed of eat, the same thing was discovered on digging for the Victoria Tower some three or four years ago. The entire works in St. James's Park are expected to be completed by the beginning of May, and, as the gardens at Kew are made now to produce a large number of halfhardy plants, such as geraniums, &c., and as also the enclosure has been thoroughly, for the first time, drained, the frequenters of thepark mayconfidently anticipate a vast improvement in tsgeneral aspect. While, however, so much has been don. in St. James's Park, a large amount of money has also been expended in Hyde Park, and to a good purpose. Bat little has been said on the subject, and very few personsh ave been aware of what has beoo going on for the last few months, except that-they have seen a number of workmen employed, and a good deal of dirt and muck. The improvement in question will be sure to meet with general approval when it is completed, which will be early in May. A new road, or rather path, planted on each dde with shrubs, is being made from the marble arch to Victoria-gate. It will be, when completed, more than three-ouarters of a mile in length, and will be the finest walk which the metropolis will be able to boast of. While making this new road one of the workmen disoovered a mass of valuable gold coins; so valuable, indeed, that he has not been since since. The new illuminated clock at Hyde Park-corner has been set up, in order to judge of the effect previous to its principle being adopted in the monster clock in the Palace at Westminster. Te dials of iUuminated clocks have hitherto been of groand or opaque glass, with gilt numbers and gilt handgs A new material is now used, which appears to answer admirably. The glass, instead of being ground, is coated with white enamel, with dark-blue numbers, the hands being of the same colour. In the daytime the dial presents a solid appearance, like that of an ordinary watch, and at night, witha light behindit, the dial presents a much more even and clear appearance than ground glass. Those who are desirous to know what the future appearance of the great dock wi be can satisfy their curiosity by examiningthat at Grosvenor-gate. The great clack i4 expected to be in motion, with its concomitat bels, befo the seon clw-Obsercr,

His Royal lighness the General Commanding-in-Chief will hold a lev6o at 1 o'clock on Thursday next.
The reports of our Malta correspondent under this head come down to the 1lth of iebruary, between which date and the 24th preceding the Sultan, Pera, and Euxine steamers had arrived from Southampton, proceeded to Alexandria, and the last two returned on the 11th, when the Pera left on her return to England with the heavy India mail, and the Euxine for Marseilles with the overland mail and despatches. The Thessalia and Andes (screws), from Liverpool, had arrived, and left for Constantinople, whence, after flling up at Smyrna, the Athenian and Athens had arrived, and left for LiverpooL The Bseotia, Aleppo, Melita, and Laconia had arrived from Alexandria, and left for LiverpooL The St. Elmo arrived from Glasgow and Gibraltar on the 8th.
Beyond these, and the arrival and departure of the usual E'rench and English maii steamers, bringing at this season a greatly reduced list of passengers, the only movements reported are the following:-
" Her Majesty's screw steam gunboat Wanderer returned from Cagliari on the 27th of January, whither she had been despatched to telegraph to Government the China and Persian news.
The Clara Louisa, hired freightship, arrive& from London on the 3d of February, with gunpowder and Government stores.
"Her Maesty's surveying steam-sloop Medina arrived from the Bosphorus and Corigo on the 28th of January; and on the same day Her Majesty's steam-sloop Shearwater, from Corf a, for which last mentioned port the Centaur steamfrigate, which returned from Tripoli on the 29th of January, left on the 4th of February, conveying Captain Piper, Lieutenants Whitten (and two sons), Suttie, Morley, Sontham, Andrea, Buchanan (and wfife), Simpson, Beale, Richards, Clerks, and Jepson.
"sHer Majesty's steam-frigate Gladiator arrived from Bujukdere on the Ist of February, having on board Captain Warren, R.N., of Her Majesty's ship Cressy, on sick leave, and Commander Warren, R.N.
" Her Majesty's steam transport Supply, with supernumerary seamen and Marines for the fleet, left for the Bosphorus on the 7th.
"Her Majesty's screw Sloop Wye left for England on th 3d.
"Her Majesty's steam-frigate the Dauntless, conveying ieutenant palmer, 47th, and 24 military invalids, left for England on the 5th, having in tow the Cracker gunboat. Commander Frederick Holland, }LN., went passenger by the Dauntless.
" Her Mtajesty's sailing transport Diligence left for Engand on the same day, laden chiefly with condemned provisions.
"Her Majesty's screw corvette Swallow left for the Bos. phorus on the 3d, conveying Surgeon Slight, R.., to be tried by a naval court-martial, the witnesses touching which are in the fleet She also conveyed Lieutenant Carter and Mr. Bovistock, RN.
" The schooner yach' Maria, Mr. Alfred Williams owner, arrived on the 4th from Palermo, Messina, and Syracuse, and left for Tunis and Gibraltar on the 9th.
"The schooner yacht Titania, having on board the owner, Mr. R. Stephenson, and Mr. Lee, sailed for Gibraltar on the 5th.
" The French Government screw-transport La Bordogne arrived from Milo on the 3d, and left on the 5th for Algiers.
"- The Ottoman steamer David arrived from Gibraltar, Algiers, and Bona on the 3d, and left for Consa'ntinople on the 8th.
"The Peninsular and Oriental Company's ship Pera, CaptaiU J. Soy, arrived at Malta at4 a.m. on the 2th of January, having made a remarkably fine passage out of seven days 18 hours, giving an average speed of 12 knots. She ran from SouthAmpton to Gibraltar in four days three hours,the quickest passage yet made, with the exception of the Himalaya's, which occupied a little under three days. The P'era was detained at Gibraltar 18 hours, in consequence of having arrived just after gunfire. It would seem to be an unnecessary detention that, as in this case, a ship like the Pera, requiring neither coals nor anything else, should be kept so many hours at Gibraltar because she happened to arrive a short time after the customary hour of visiting ships. The Pera met with thick, dirty weather on starting but afterwards strong north and north-west winds, with a heavy north-west swell across the Bay. She brought a large num of assengers (130) and a valuable cargo of speciesay about 400,0001.
" The company's new steamship the Aden, Captain Bernard, made a remarkably quick passage from Bombay to Suez, with mails and passengers, having made an average run of 320 miles daily.
"- The situation of the officers of the naval establishments in Malta has been materially imaproved by a general increase of pay. The salaries of the master shipwright and the superintending engineer have been increased by1001. a-
ar each. The other gentlemen of the dock and victualg yards and hospital have been placed uPon a rising scale of pay, as in I;nglad, where the salaries of the 1st clerks increase by 11. a-year, as far as 4501.; those of the 2d class also by lL, asfa2ras300l.; and those of the 3d class by 10l., as far as 1501. Besides the above emoluments, the 1st clerks in each department are aUowed free quarters."
On Saturday afternoon the depots of the folowing regiments belonging to the Provisional Battalion at Chathamviz., 10th Foot, under the command of Captain J. V. H. Montague; 29th, under the command of Captain J. M. Lyle; 64th, commanded by Brevet-Major W. J. Chads; and the 83d, under the commandof Captain W. Nott, toge. ther numbering about 500 non-commissioned officers and men,-left Chatham barracks and proeeeded to Brompton barracks, where they are to be quartered, their removal having been rendered necessary, ow-ing to the crowded state of the Provisional Battalion, and the large number of volun teera for the various Indian depots which will arrive at Chatham garrison dnuring the present week. The 10th and 29th depots are stationed in the Stable barracks, on the south side of Brompton barracks, and the 64th and 83d are quartered in the huts at Prince Henry's Bastion, which are also occupied by the depot of the 3Medical Staff Corps, The folowing officers have been moved from Chatham barracks with their depots :-Lieutenant T. C. Robertson, 10th; Lieutenant E. Gorton, 29th; LIeutenant F. Alban, 64th; and Lieutenant C. C. Gore, 83d.
The number of workmen employed in Chatham dockyard having been ordered to be reduced, 16 men received their discharge from that establishment on Saturday last, and 30 more will be discharged at the end of this week. In con. sequence of the order which has been issued by the Admni. ralty for reducing the pay of the labourers employed in the dockyard to 12s. a-week, a pubHl meeting has been held at Chatham, presided over by the High Constable, when it was Iunanimously resolved to memorialize the Lords of the Adeni| salty to rescind that order.
The Diamond, 27, Captain C. B. Hamilton, is being stripped at Chatham and her stores removed; in order to be paid off into ordinary on Wednesday next.

The iron paddle-steamerTrident is ordered to be undocked at Woolwich on Monday, and the Banshee wil be placed in No. I on the following day, for thorough examination, prior to commencing service as Admiralty yacht, and tender to the Fisgard.
The Ordnance screw steamer Balaklava arrived at Woolwich on Saturday, with a cargo of returned stores from Queenstown. A number of pensioners who were taken into the employment of the shipwright department of Woolwich dockyard as riggers' labourers during the period of the late war are ordered to be discharged, and to be provided with the means of returning to their respective homes.
Her Maesty's screw-corvette Scout, in Woolwich basin, has received her masts, engines, and machinery, and was on Saturday replaced under the east shears by Her MIajesty's ship Spitfire.
The steam troopship Dee, Master-Commander Pollen, left Woolwich on Friday evening, laden with machinery and boilers, for the Royal Sovereign and Melpomene, at Portsmouth. Mr. Tandy, the chief engineer of the vessel, received instructions from the Lords of the Admiralty to take careful notes relative to the working of the super. heating steam apparatus during the voyage, and to report officially thereon on his return.
The Admiralty yacht Vivid, which has been lent for temporary service to the Royal Mail SteampacketCompany, has been fitted with Mr. Jeffreea' patent smoke consumer and
fuel economizer, for experiment on board that vessel. It is considered that this method will effect an economy in the consumption of fuel to the amount of at least 40 per cent. The inspecting officer of machinery afloat attached to Woolwicn dockyard was ordered to take passage in the Vivid to Dover, and to report on the operation of the invention for the benefit of Government.
The screw steamship Chile, Captain Smith, with mails and passengers for the West Coast of South America, which left Plymouth on the 15th of January, put back to that port on Priday last, dismasted and disabled. She has been no further than 17 west, and for a considerable time was in imminent danger of drifting on the coast of Spain, in the Bay of Biscay. Shortly after her departure she expe. riened heavy gales, which continued with so mnuch force as to carry away the foremast and jibboom close down, and as the rigging was of wire it was Somne time before the nwreck could be cleared. After this it was found necessary to cat away the topmut. While preparing for this a heavy roll of the vessel snapped the mainmast short off, and two men in the tops were thrown into the sea, but managed to getOf board agair. Formanvdays after this she continued drifting about, and the crew urged the necessity of abandoning her, which was energetically resist,ed by the officers. After many failures, jurymasta were rigged, and the after tanies filled to get her down by the stern, when she managed to hold her own till fine weather was expe rienced, when she gr.adually approached the Channel, from which she had never Leen digtant more than three or four days' sail duringa perio,i of 29 days. The engines were of very little service in her d.qtres, and gre4t alterations will
be necessary in the machinery before she can proceed to sea again. Her leakagei8 not to anyextent.
Commander Luxmore and the surviving officers and sea'en of the steamSloop Argus have erected in the pubtic cemetery at Plymouth a handsome cenotaph to the memory of their friends and messmates who died of yeUow fever in the West Indies in the early part of the year 1856.
lIer Majesty's steam frigate Arrogant, 47, Captain Lystr, is alongside Portsmouth Dockyard dismantling, preparatory to being paid off. A shocking accident occurred on board her on Saturday. As one of the heavy pivot guns, a 6Spounder, weighing 95 cwt., was being hoisted out the fall broke, and the gun fell upon one of the crew named James Desman, whose body was dreadfully mangled, causing instantaneous death. The Admiralty Coroner, Mr. Swainson, held an inquest on board in the afternoon, when a verdict of "Accidental death" was returned. The tackle fall was quite sound and in good order, and had not been used more than half-a-dozen times.
The convict Johnson, who stabbed the Warder Astin lately at Portsmouth, was on Saturday committed for trial by the Portsmouth magistrates, and removed to Winchester Gaol the same day.
Rear-Admiral of the Red Provo Wiliam Parry WaUis has been nominated to sacceed to the command of the squadron on the South-East Coast of America station on the expiration of the term of Rear-Admiral Johnstone.

THE WAR DEPARTMENT.
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I shall feel obliged by your allowing the following statement to appear in your columns*-
On the 7th of October, 1855, my brother, a lieutenant in the 3d Buffs, died of dysentery, in hospital, before Sebas-
The officer who wrote to me informing us of the event, in a second letter stated that my brother's effects, as I suppose is usual on such occasions, had been sold, and thal on rny applying to the WFar-officeIshould receive anaccount of their disposaL
In the in erval between the receipt of the two letters I wrote to Cox ard Co., the ents for the regiment, asking about some mnoney which had been sent to my brother, Zan they replied, directing me in the same manner, adding that a small balance (stating the amount) was due on my late brother's account.
On the 16th of November of the same year I 'addressed a letter to Lord Panmure, mentioning what I had been directed to do, and asking what steps were necessary in order to obtain the sum realized. Not receiving an answer to this as soon as I expected, I wrote again on the 1st of December, repeating my request. A reply to my first letter, dated the 6th of December, acquainted me that no statement of my brother's effec's had up to that time reasbed the War-office from the regiment, butthat the regimental agents reported that they had a balance in their hands due to the deceased amounting to &c. A reply to my second letter, dated the 12th of becember, informed me that the commanding offcer of the 3d Foot had been requested to forward a statement of the effects of the late Lieutenant - as early as possible. I waited till the 4th of February, 1856, when I again wrote to Lord Panmure, saying I was sorry to trouble him again in the matter, bat that I should like to be informed whether the statement referred to in my former letters had yet been received from the Czimea, and if so how possession of it could be obtained and any balance due be received by my brother's relatives. An answer, dated the 16th of February, cquainted me that this statement called for in the letter addressed to the commanding officer on the 12th of Dcember (the same date as that of the provious letter to me) had not been received, but that as soon as it reached that department it would be communicated to me. In the meantime, in a letter dated the 9th of February, the medal awarded for my brother'R services in the Crimea was forwarded to me from the Waroffice.
Being absent from the country during the summer, I did aotlnng further in the mattertill the st of September last, when I w-ote to General YVo Straubenzee, who I supposed still comwanded the 3d Foot, mentioning how the case stood, and asking if he could tell me whether the statement had been forwarded to the War-office. He replied that he had not commanded the regiment for some time, but advised me to apply again to the War-office, which I did on the 7th of November. I said in the letter I then wrote tha' I had waited patiently since the 16th of February for the promised statement iu vain, and, as a sufficient time seemed to have elapsed for its being forwarded from the headquarters of the regimeut, I had been advised to bring the case again under his Lordship's notice, in order to ascertain whether there was any prospect of my soon obtaining it, and receiving paymuent o the small balance due on the accourtt
I added that, should the reply not be satisfactory, I should be compelled to take other means for accomplishing my object. The answer, dated the 12th of November, stated that the commanding officer had again been called upon to furnish his non-effective account.
Three months have elapsed to-day since the date of that letter, and I have heard nothing more concerning the affair, and perhaps never shall. I have not taken, though I proniosea. doing so, any otber steps except this one of laying before the public, if yon are kind enough to permit me, this example of the manner in which business is transacted at the War-offlce.
My brother's death was too melancholy a subject and the amount to be paid too small to cause me to undertake the task of the correspondence I have detailed willingly; but I thought it my duty to obtain a settlement of the business. This letter is probably the last move I shall make.
I am your obedient servant.

LIVERPOOL, Feb. 14.-The Royal mail steamship
LIVERPOOL, Feb. 14.---The Royal mail steamship Niagara sailed hence for Boston to-day, with 90 passengers, the usual mail, and a fair cargo. The Great Britain, which sails on Monday for Melboarne, has on board upwards of 500 passengers, a large ship's mail, and a full cargo. She is in beautif trim, and is expected to make a remarkably quick passage.
CBI.: Ih- ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES.- The New York Pimas comments on the fact that English newspapers contain a great deal about crimes and the treatment of criminals. The New York Times says-
" If we were to judge from the Inrmense number of eoaunviicatlons and editorials which we fnd In the Enish papers about convicta. ticket-cf-lcaye men, psisons, penal colonies, and exections, we should be led to the inerence that Great Britain waa a nat.on d c rIinals.Y
Whenever a murder or other great offence is committed in any part of England, Scotland, or Ireland, the Londonnewspapers contain a full account of the matter. Bat if a murder he committedin Vii, ississipp, Arkansas, &c.,itisten to one that the people of the other States wiil neverbear a wordabontit. Thesuperficial reader of London and American newspapers is apt to infer from *-heir contents that crime is far more prevalert in England than in Awerica ; but the conclusion is wholly erroneous. The division of this country into States is the fruitful source of many delusions. The people of the different States know very little about the oaaffair of the other States, especially of those at a distance, It follows that if we were to judge from the silence of American newspapers in any particular State about crimes committed throughout the Union we should be led to the erroreous inference that criminals were very scarce indeed in the model Republic.-New York Ruropean.
COURLT OF CoImIoN CouNcm.-On Saturday a special Court was held for the purpose of proceeding with the discussion of the remaining propositions agreed to by the Corporation Inquiry Committee and submitted for the adoption of the Court as grounds for a biUl for presentation to the Government for the future regulation of the corporation. The discussions were of an entirelyformal nature and resulted in propositions 16 to 25 being carried almost unanimously ands with mere verbal amendmen's of an unimportant character. The propositions numbered 26 to 49 were agreed to nem, con. withou. discussion. Amendments were prop d with regard to proposition 15, and eventuaUy that of H. L. Taylor was carried, which proposed " That the Aldermen submit to the Court of Common Council detailed quarterly estimates of their probable expenditure for each next ensuing quarter, and, when approved and ordered for payment by this Court, the Aldermen to draw upon the chamber for that amount, and to present quarteirly accouts of the sums actualy disbursed in each last precedingqurer." The propositions were tbenreferred hack to the CorPOration Inquiry Committee, who were empowvered to confer with the Government respecting them, and to report to the Court.
A RACE: ACLOSS r'a: Amyrr.-The United States mail steamship Atlantic left New York for Liverpool on the lst inst. Anong the passengers was a man named Winter (with his wife), a clerk of a mercantile firm in that city, having in his possession $2,000 belonging to his employers, and which he had obtained by bresidng open the safe. On his absence being ascertained, together with the amount of money with which he had absconded, the principal of the firm obtained a warrant for his apprehensmon, and took a passage by the British and North American mail steamship Persia, which sailed three days afterwards. The chances were in favoar of the criminal clerk; for, though the Persia is the fastest steamer afloat, it could scarcely be expected that she would overtake a full-powered steamer, which sailed three days before her. No sign of the pursued steamer was seen until off the port, when the Perii came up with and passed her, arriving in the river two hours before her. On Mr. Hood, the gentleman who boards the Cunard steamers to take charge of the mails, going aboard, he was introduced to the pursang merchant, who asked, with some anxiety, if any one had landed from the Atlantic, On being answered in the negative, he stated the case, and asked for a detective. Subsequently, accompanied by a police-officer, he boarded the Atlantic, and confronted the astounded Winter, whose dreams of security were thus rudely dissipated. Noarly the whole of the missing money was found upon him. He was brought ashore, and now awaits the decision of Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne, United States' Consul at Liverpool, who will, in all likelihood, order him to be sent back, inr custody, by the Atlantic, the steamer which brought him, and which sails for New York on Wednesday next, so that he will, no doubt, have robbed his employers of $2,000, aailed to England from New York, a distance of about 3,000 miles, been captured on board a vessel in the Mersey by his employer, whom he had left behind at New York, taken back to NewYork, and comnmitled Ifr X d4, All within the sort spa*cec of oue n~nh,

The Relief Of Jellalabad.
THE RELIEF OF JELLALABAD.
TO TEE EDITOR OF THEY TIES.
Sir,-I observe in The Times of this morning the folovring statement made in the House by Captain Ii Vernom, in enumerating the 3ervices of General Pollock in Affghanistan, -" General PoUock carried the passes at the poirt of the bayonet, and relieved Jellalabad." You will therefQre oblige me by publishing the following reply on my WOO this announcement:- el
I am quite satisfied that Captain Vernon stated correctlywhat he learnt from others, but, as I have seen a similarstatement made before, I now consider it necessary to seS. this question at rest in all time to come by denying in themoet positive and unqualified manner that General Pollock: contributed in any way whatsoever to the relief of Jelalabad, where we had maintained ourselves against the. enemy by our own ingenuity from the 13th of November, 1851, till the 7th of April, 1852, under the severest trials and privations without any attempt being made to succour us, although left to the mercy of the whole Affghan nation and the support of our own fortitude, which never forsoo.0
us under the most appaUing circumstances; and when wehad.Z eatenupourlastgreenleaf, after being closely invested by theAffghan army under Mahomed AkbarKhan fromnthe19thof February(the date of his arrival atJellalabadafterhisdestruction of General Elphinstone's force) to the 7th of April, we, B; have no hesitation in saying-and it is a fact well known to everyone-sallied out at my most urgent recommendatisa.. and nnder my entire arrangement, as the matter was placed in my hands, with about 1,500 men-the utmost we could. muster-and six guns, and attacked the enemy, fnUy 6,000 strong, inthe open field, and completely routed them, andwith so mnuch loss that Akbar Khan, in his frantic flight, never drew up until he had placed himself at a distance of 70 miles from Jellalabad, so great was the panic created, he having lost his guns, wits, camp, and, in fact, everything he or his army possessed; and here was the restoration of the prestige of the army and confidence to the native soldiers, not one of wlhom would have gone on to Cabul but for that "illustrious" achievement; and from that moment. the entire country was at our feotand all its resources at our command. General PoUock reached JeUal&bad on the 16th.
of April, 10 days after the country had been freed fronu thepresence of any enemy.
It was by that heroic and, I will say, unpayable achievement on the part of the garrison of Jellalabad that India was raised from her prostrate position, and enabled to look erect again, and England's honour relieved from the stain that had been imprinted upon it by the entire and most humiliating destruction of her army.
I will now, in support of my statement, quote the general orders that were issned on that occasion, and whichwere sent as a compliment by the Governor-General of India to me :-
" Seoret Department, Denares, April 21, 1842.
The Governor-General feels assured that every subject of the British Government will peruse with the deepest interest and satisfaction the report he now communicates of the entire defeat of the Affghan troops under Mahomed Akbar Khan by the garrison of Jellalabad.
" That ' illustrious' garrison, which by its constancy in enduring privation, and bv its valour in action, has already obtaired for itself the sympathy and respect of every true soldier, has now, saUying forth from its waUs under the command of its gallant leader, Major-General Sir Robert Sale, thoroughly beaten in the open field an enemyof more than three times its numbers, taken the standards of their boasted cavalry, destroyed their camp, and recaptured four guns, which, under circumstances that can never again occur, had during the last winter fallen into their hands.
"The Governor-General cordially congratulates the army upon thereturnof victory te its ranks. He is convinced that there as in all former times, it wiUl be found, while, as at Jeilalabad, the European and native troops, mutually supporting each other and evincing equal discipline and valour, are led into action by officers in whom they justly confide.
"The Governor-General directs that the substance of this notification and Major-General Sir Robert Sale's report be carefully made known to all the troops, and that a salute oE 21 guns be fired at everv nrlncinol tion nf f- Sb.
' T. . MrAnnAe)- -
"Secretary to the Government of India."
"Political Department, Allahabad, April 30, 1842.
'Tho Governor-General has received a report from Major-General Pollock, C.B., dated the 16th inst., annourncing his arrival at Jellalabad.
"leceiving the command of the army at Peshavwri
under circumstances of peculiar difficulty, he has, in the midst of new and unforeseen embarrassments and disappointments, preserved a firm mind, and, justly relying upon his own judgmentt he has at last, with equal discretion, accomplished the object he was directed to effect.
"The Governor-General has already, in communicating the despatch from Major-General Sir Robert Sale, KC.B., dated the 7th, expressed his high sense of the services oEf that officer and of the garrison of Jellalabad, terminating on that day by a decisive victory, which would have left nothing to desire had Colonel Dennie survived to enjoy it.
" The garrison of Jellalabad having on that day achieved its safety by its own prowess, and being now reunited tothe army by the movements of the force under the command of Major-General Pollock, C.B., it remains only for the Governor-General to testify his opinion of the just claims of that garrison to the gratitade of the Government and of their country.
" The Governor-General is pleased to direct that a silver medal be made for every officer, non-commissioned officer, and private European and native soldier who belonged to the garrison of Jellalabad on the 7th of April, 1842, such medals to be all similar, and to bear on one side a ' mural crown,' superscribed I Jellalabad,' and on the other side the words '7th of April, 1842.'
"The Governor-General will request his ExcelIency the Commander-in-Chief of the army to give instructions in due time that the several corps comprising the garrison of JeLalabad may, on their return to India, be received at aU the stations on their route to their cantonments by all the troops at such stations, in review order, with presented arms. "T. H. MADDOCOK
" Secretary to the Government of India."
"NOTMCATION BY TE RIOHT ROR . TInE GovER.NoRGEXRAL OF INDIA-CA.u.r, FERoZErORE, DEC. 17,1842.
"This day Major-General Sale, G.C.B., passed the Sutlej at the head of all the troops which composed the garrison of Jellaabad. The Major-General was received at the foot of the bridge by the Governor-General and his Excellency the Commnander-in-Chief.
" The army of reserve, formed in one line extending two miles and a-half, received the Major-General and the garrison of JeUalabad in review order, with preseuted arms.
" A salute of 19 guns was fired As the MIajor-Generasal passed the centre of the line.
"T. H. MADDOCK."
Now, after this very full statement of facts I hope we shalU hear no more of the relief of Jellalabad by General Pollock. The friends of the Genera must for the future found his claims to distinction upor some surer circumstance than that particular one; for, being one of the few survivors, I never can allow any one, not fully entitled, to share in the lustre that encircles the remembrance of the heroic and unsurpassed defence of that place, or of the brilliant and daring action of the 7th of April, through which alone we were relieved from the enemy and restored to comfort, food, and unrestricted liberty, without thanks to any, one but ourselves.

ieutenant-General.

EXTRAVAGANCE IN OFFICERS.-The Gazette of last
ExTRAVAGA"CE xN OFFiCERis.-The Cactdte of lasft weeX contained tho announcement of the retirement of a young officer from tho Life Guards, "by the sale of his commission," and, as no successor was appointed, we conclude ho received the money to which he was entitled from the fund held available at the War-office for such purposes. We are aware that the officer had sent in his papers, owng to sll-health, some months since, but there were no, candidates for commissions in the Life Guards. We arealso, aware that it is a very difficult thing to get young officers for the Royal Horse Guards Blue. Why is this? How comes it that there is no little ambition extant among the younger members of the aristocracy, seeing that the corps it question have not merely the pnvilege of protec the person of the Sovereign, but are renowned for their ioism in deadly strife ? The answer is, that there are verr few purses that can bear the expense. Costume, equipment, the mess, horses (exclusive of bunters, the box at the Opera pnvate chambers, dogearts, and the calls of socit absorb from 500. to 1,0001. per annum extra to te py any
allowances of the cornet. He must fall into the extravagances of the rest, or he won't do for the Householkl Cavalry. As long as young menr-especially of noble families-were found with the means and inchnation to. enter the Life and Horse Guards the ruinous and preposterous system went on. Expense of a frivolous and needless charecter seemed to be the roper accompaniment of the modern Afousquetircs de K Iione. But the system is wearing itself out. Colonels may say " It is useless for s. young fellow to come to us unless he can spend his 5001. a-year ; but if such youngsters are not-thanks to tho growing prudenco of their reatives-to be found, the heav cost of military life must be gven sp, or the regiments Hi sovn be without offlcers,-> ;Ti "~ , rpj2j
