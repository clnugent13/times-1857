MONBY-AfABKBTatid0l.TYLtVTEbLIGENOR. Saturday Eraning. The English funds opened this mormng at the dull prices of yesterday, and remained without alteration throughout the day. Consols were quoted 90J to i for money, and 901 to 91 for the 14th of October. New Three per Cents. left off at 91 to i; India Stock, 210 to 213; India Bonds, 22s. to 17s. discount; Exchequer. bonds, 98i to i ; and Excheqner-bills, 5s. to Is. discount. The transactions in foreign stocks have been very limited, but the market wears a steady appearance. Mexican were negotiated for the account at 22; Russian Five per Cents., 110; Spanish Certificates, 6k; Turkish Six per Cents., 95; ditto for the account, 95X; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 64k. 'lthe final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 85c. for money and 67f. 5c. for the end of the month, showing no alteration. About 19,0031. of gold was sold to the Bank today. Although the next telegraph from India cannot be regarded as positively due till Saturday next, the 12th inst., its arrival is nowr possible at any time. The last steamer was detained at Calcutta two days beyond her appointed date, but arrived at Suez five days before ehe was expected, and, as it has been officially notified that on the present occasion there will be no China mail, and the possibility of a detention at Point de Galle is therefore precluded, it is not unreasonable to suppose that equal speed may be attaineL lVith regand to the probable effect of the next telegraph on the Stock-Exchange, there is a certainty that if the newvs should be merely not unfavoarable a considerable increase of confidence wil be created, since the most vivid apprehensions have lately been entertained with respect to Lucknow, Agra, and Hyderabad, and also of the possible occurrence of some outbreak among the general population in connexion with'the great annual Mahommedan festival, which would take place at the beginning of August, four days after the despatch of the last advices from Bombay. Supposing good news on these points to be received, a decided improvement in the funds may be looked for, even if affairs before Delhi are stl reported to remain without alteration. Indeed, if the progress of our troops should prove to have been satisfactory in other districts, the capture of Delhi in case of its having been attended with any considerable loss on our side and the escape even of a portion of the mutineers wiUl be heard of almost with regret. Latterly there has been a great change of feeling in this respect, and the hope has now become general that the repressionof the insurrection in other parts of the province may proceed sO effectually as to allow our army to surround the place until discord, disease, and famine compel an unconditional surrender. Letters from Paris allege that the bullion in the Bank of France has increased 1,400,0)01. since the last monthly return. The discount-market is also said to be easier, choice paper being negotiated at between 41 and 5 per cent. Although the Bank maintains its position only by artificial purchases of gold, the speculators are hoping that a reduction of the rate of discount to 5 per cent. will soon be adopted. The projected issue of 21. notes will probably accelerate that measure. Three months back a letter was inserted in The Timnes from M. Pereire, the President of the Credit Mobilier Comcany, denouncing a statement that M. Charles Thurneyssen, who had just absconded, was partially connected with some of the leading persons in the Credit Mobilier as an abuse of the privileges of the press. All Paris is now in consternation at finding not only that M. Auguste Thurneyssen, the uncle of the defaulter, and one of the most influential directors of the Cr6dit MIobilier, has been declared a bankrupt from his connexion with that individual, but also that the Cr6dit Mobilier is felt to be so compromised by this judgment that several of the other chief members of its direction are hurriedly endeavouring to abandon it. A batch of resignations is said to have been sent in within the last few days, which it was decided should not be accepted, as the public announcement of such a secession might prove fataL One of the number, howovor, M. Ernest Andre, was determined to free himself, and he has accordingly done so by a notarial act. Several others, it is asserted, may be expected to follow his example-viz., Messrs. Mallet, Bur:a, and IJribarren, and, according to some accounts, even M. Hottinguer. Meanwhile the OOf. shares, which at one time stood at 1,900f., are rapidly falling. A week back the quotation was 980f., and it is now 865Sf. Every effort had been made to prevent public alarmt, but it is to be apprehended that the mischief will make further rapid progress._ It is admitted that the prestige of the establishment is whoUy gone, that the expediency of a winding-up is inmninent, and that in the uncertainty as to the class of securities held or the possibility of their realization this prospect is such as to create intense anxiety. Meanwhile the ruin which has fallen upon M. Auguste Thurneyssen, and which may extend to others, must be regarded with deep regret. He was formerly connected with the house of Stieglitz, the Court banker at St. Petersburg, and has for 20 years occupied an eminent position as a French capitalist. The ultimate fate of the Credit IMIobilier has never been a matter of doubt, and the disenchantment of the Parisian public with regard to it can lead only to benefit. Their eyes might have been opened sooner if it had been possible for them to receive the warnings of lookers-on in England, not as the results of jealousy, butt as sincere attempts to avert a course of proceeding which reason and experience alike demonstrated could have but one termination, and which, by injuring the system of European credit, must be felt to affect in a greater or less degree the commercial interests of all countries. A proposal has been made to the tEast India-house by the European and American Steam Company, under the management of Mr. Croskey, calctlated to facilitate the periodical transport by the overland route of such reinforcements to India as will be necessary throughout the next six or nine months to keep the army up to the amount to which it has now been raised. The company possess eight powerful screw steamers of an average capacity of 2,31, tons, and it is suggested that four of these should be employed to establish a fortnightly communication from Southampton to Alexandria, and the remaining four to perform the service from Suez to Bombay. Each vessel could take about 1,100 men, and a supply at the rate of 2,200 per month could thus be continuously kept up, the troops reaching Bombay within 45 days from their leaving this country. Owing to the shorter duration of the voyage, it is represented that for every thousand men despatebed 12,0001. would be saved by the adoption of this route as compared with that by the Cape, wbile an advantage will be afforded in enabling the (;overnment to send home invalids, beth civil and military, with the greatest comfort and expedition. The chief recommendation of the offer seems to consist in the uniformity of the size of the vessels, so that the number of troops landed at Alexandria woiuld in each instance find precisely the same accommodation at Suez. Four of the fleet have lately beeu taken up by the India Company, and are now on their way to Calcutta vid the Cape; and, supposing the present scheme to be assented to, instructions would be transmitted by the overland mail on the 10th inst. for these not to return to England, but to go to Suez at such periods as to be in readiness to meet arrivals across the isthmus from this side, The ships of the company are the Golden Fleece, Lady Jocelyn, Queen of the South, Hydaspes, Indiana, Argo, Calcutta, and Jason. The following is an abstract of the railway intelligence of the week :-At a meetinz of the Leeds, Bradford, and Halifax Junction a dividend of 5 per cent. was declared. The dividend on the Somerset Central is at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum. Preference shares are to be issued to complete tho line to Wells. The Birkenhead, Lancashire, and Cheshire Junction dividend is 3 per cent., leaving 1,1251. That of the Dublin 'and Belfsst Junction is 18s. per share, heing at the rate of 4 per ceut. per annumi. It had previously been 6 per cent., and the reduction is attributed to the cessation of withdrawals from the reserve fund, the high rate of interest on the outstanding debts, and the increased salaries of the company's officers. The revenue of the Waterford and Limerick is only sufficient to pay the dividends on the preference shares. The receipts, however, show an improvement .;f 4021. over the corresponding period of last year. and the exnditure is diminished. The gross receipts of the worth-Western for the past half-year are 23,1491., and the expenses 12 ,77t1. After payment of in- terest on debenture debt, uncompleted land pur-, chasee, and other charges, a balance is carries forward of 706. At a meeting of the Mid Efent it was statedthatthe works are irnatisfactoryptogreg. A.n agreement hs been made with the West Ead and Crystal Palace for the passage of engine ans camriages over the portion of the line of tit eomnpany between Shortlands and Beckenham. The West End line will be ready for traflic next spring and it is expected the Mid-Kent will be openeu -simultaneously. Power was given to borrow23,0001. The Ambergate, Nottingham, and Boston dividend is 2s. 9d. per share. A great decrease has taken place in the minerl traffic, but a material addition is anticipated from the formation of the proposed line from Slesford to Boston. At a meetng of the Whitebaven and Furnesa Junction a full dividend on the preference thares was declsred. The revenue for tho last year ortwo has been graduallyintcreaaing, and there is a probability of its continuing to do so from the prosperity attending the iron trade. 50,0001. was authorized to be raised on preferenoc shares. The traffic on the Whiteinven, Cleatori and Egremont shows an increase of nearly 97 per cent, on iron ore, and 195 per cent. on other articles. The dividend is at the rate of 71. per cent. per annum, carrying 871. to the rese,rved fund. At the Boston, Sle*ford, and Midland Counties meeting it was stated that half of the line is completed, and that hitherto tbe pawsenger traffic has been goo The goods traffic is to commence on the lat of September. The amount expended for construetion is 94,973L The profits of the Hereford, Ross, and Glocester for the pat half-year amount to 1,636L, which will be applied in reduction of the balance against capital of 3,0101. At a meeting of the A *hareholders in tha St. Andrew's and Quebec Railway it was announced that the Bill to confirm the purchae of theirintertby the Now Brunswick and Canads Railway and Land Company has received the Xoyal assent. A committee waa appointed to- investigate the claim of Mr. Sharpe to 10,000 are3z of the company's land. The report of the West Hartlepool Railway and Dock atates the revenue for 1856 at 164,1351L, being an increase of about 14 per cent. The improvements in the harbour have produced satiufactory results; at frst provision was made only for vessels up to300 tons, but now ships of upwards of 2,500 tons can be loaded. No further new works are contemplated. The income of the first half of the present year was 78,710L An intermikdiate dividend at the rate of 4i per cent. pet annum has been declared. At a meeting of the Cornwall Company the obairman anmounced that an Act had been obtained to extend the time for the completion of the works to, June, 1860, and to authorize the immediate isue of preference shares for 300,0001., with a power of & further issue of 100 0001., to construct the line from Plymouth to Truro. The new Exeter and Exmouth Company have determined to commencep operations forthwith. The proposed lease to the South Devon has been rejecteT At a meeting of the Dublin and Drogheda the dividend was in aecordance with the report. The receipts for the past half-year show an increase of 1,041. as compared with the corresponding half of 1856. The dividend of theDublin and Wicldow is3sl. per share. The increase of revenue is 3,000l. on the Kingstown branch, and 2,3181. on the Wicklow line, as compared with the corresponding period of last year. At a meeting of the Lancashire and Yorkshire the dividend was in accordance with the report. The increase of traffic amounts to 40,6651.; the working expenses have also been 20,4421. more than in 1856. The dispute with the Blackburn Company is unsettled. The arrangements for the lease of the Aire and Calder Canal, in conjunction with the NorthEastern, are on the point of completion. A. survey has been ordered with a view to the construction of a new line between Oldham and Rochdale. The works of the Forest of Dean Central have been commenced, and the sanction of the Office of Woods in respect of the lands in Dean Forest has been fully accorded. The first section of the Border Counties line is progressing, and wiU be opened in November. It is intended to apply to Parliament for power to make an extension to the new branch to Carlisle, proposed to be constructed by the North British. At a, meeting of the Edinburgh and Glasgow the dividend declared was In accordance with the report. The half-yearly dividend of the Dundee Perth, and Aberdeen Junction is at the rate of 11 per cent. per annum, or i more than the dividend for the corresponding period of 1856. The dividend on the Great Southern and Western (Ireland) is at the rate of 5 per cent. The decrease is attributed to a falling off in the receipts for carriage of troops and stores and to the competition of the Grand Canal. The Roscrea and Parsonstown line will be opened in November. The item of 40,5261. for frauds committed by the late transfer clerk will be charged to the general reserve fund. At a meeting of the Blackburn Company explanations were given respecting the failure of their late application to Parliament. Itf is intended to apply next session. for power to construct a line from Bolton to Mhanchester. The traffic for the half-year shows an increase of 2,5671 The South Staffordshire dividend is at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, being the 3um received under the present lease; under the new lease, which will come into operation next June, the dividend will be i ^er cent. more. The leases of the Norton and Cannock and Darlaston branches to Mr. M'C1ean were an-reed to. The dividend on the Belfast and County D)own is 15s. per share-the usual rate. A proposed extension to secure uninterrupted communication fronm Dublin to Donaghadee was approved. At a meeting of the Caledonian and Dlumbartonshire Junction a dividend was declared at the rate of 4 per cent., carrying forward a balance of 5281 The offer by the Lancashire and Yorkshire to purchase the Sheffield, Barnsley, Wakefield, and Goole Railway for a fixed payment of 13,5001. a-year has been accepted. At a meeting of the East Anglian it was stated that the traffic continued to increase. The port of Lynn is rising in importance, and direc' voyages are now made from Hamburg to that place. The railway has been extended along the quays. The dividend declared was on the preference shares only. The Vale of Clwyd Railway has been commenced, and the line will be opened to St. Asaph in the spring. The works on the IJlverstone and Lancaster are stated. to be of great solidity, the viaducts especially exciting the admniration of the Government Inspector. The line was opened on the 26th of August. The following information respecting the mining business of the week i condensed from the 'Uining Journl .- 4 The large arrivals of tho precious metals caused a better feeling in the money-market at the cxmmencernet of the week, and a fair amount of mining business has been transacted.

ROBBFY FROM A MEC1H.LT'S OFFIC-.n Saturday last, at the Court-house, Leeds, Thomas Crosland, aged 16, llving with his mother in Somers-street, in that town, wan charged with feloniously entering the warehouse of Mess. De Silva nud Co., cloth merchants, Park-lane, and stealing therefrom a ceashbox oontaining 1101. in Bank of England notes and a draught. Tbe prisoner had been in the prosecutors' service for shout eighteen months, as an assistant In the wrouse and part of hix duty vvaa to look up the arehouse at night and oen It in the morning, taking the keys home with hi On Friday night2the warerhouse wraslocked upat 6o'clock, and about 11 it wfas discovered that lt had be"en etered. Mr. De Silv was sent for, and on the premises being examined it was ascertained that the cash-box, ecutaining the money mentioned above, had been stolen from a desk in the oounting-house, and that a draught drawn by the protors upon a Mr. Whittaker for 641. 7s. 6d. had aso been removed. Suspicion fell upon the prisoner, and Mlr. ))e Slim, accompanied by Poice-Superintendent Jamsx, went to his home. They found him in bed. He uat 5rst denied the robbery, but afterwards produced the cashbox from under a sof and stated that he had leit the draught for 6 in the ofmce. The osasbbx had not been opened, and the money was found to be all right. The magistrates com. mitted him for trial at the sessions.

S1AIT OF TBADE. -MANCHESTER, Smr. 5. Although the sales of cotton this week at Liverpool have reached only 65,030 against 110,500 bags last week, with less buoyancy in prices, we have had undiminished firmnens in this market. The: advance In yarns on Tuesday was about id. per lb., with a considerable business, and the oily difference experienced since has been a rather quieter feeling; with buyers of yarnH and mnanufactures disposed to wait and watch the course of the market for the raw material before operating to much extent further. The business in clothe this morning has been light, and the wbole sales of the week are not reported to be considerable. They have been sufficient, however, to enable manufacture-n to make some little progress in improving their terms to a point more in accordance with the 3ncrea3ed cost of production. Their success has been far from uniform, depending often upon the position of individual sellers in regard to stock. Inthisrespect the makers of domestics. logeloths, aud T-cloths have been more successful than the producers of most other ftbrics, from the demand having ran more upon these goods lately. The exports to India had fallen off 12,000 packages, accordlng to tle returns of lastl month, but this had been counterbanced by increased shipments to China, Central and South America, and the continent of Europe; our shipments of cloth to Central and South America being 30 per cent of the whole, and those of yarns to Germany, olland, and other European States being 80 per oent. of the whole. This great change in the direction of our markets has brought with It a considerable cbange in the description and qualities of goods taking the demand, and hence, while looms have been turned froma the production of shirtings, the looms which had been stopued, or were on short time for domestics, aro some of tbem now in full work again. Mesars. Warburton and Ormesher, s&ik-brokers, Mul, chester, have suspended, and a meeting of creditors is to be hold on Tuesday. Their uncovered debts are estimated at BIRMINGHA&f, SEPT. 5. There has been no material change in the Iron trade of South Staffnrdshire during the present week. In consequence of the late extreme heat of the woather the puddlers of the district were unable to .work full tiSme, and stocks of pigs accordingly accumulated. A slight fall in prices has been the resuIt, but this has in no degree affected the quotations of best descriptions of manufactured iron. They are firmly maintained. The home market for sheets and bars continues to improve, and Bristol and Liverpool heusem have lately bought considerably fbr exportation. The coal trade is gradually becoming more active, but competition keeps down prices Dealers continue to purchae for winter supplies, but the coalmasters of the district are reluctant to contract for deliveries during the winter at prsent quotations. The late heavy orders for hardware received from Australis have created considerable bustle in many of our manufacturing establiabments; jad it is stated that exportatioas to Germany are upon th Increame The brasafounders, notwithstanding the late advane in the price of metal, are full of orders for the winter trade, and have as yet made no alteration in their discounts. Another rise is confidently predicted, when a corresaonding advance in the price of manufaotured bras and copper goods may be expected. The marine and locomotive tube manufacturers are now busy, several of them upon orders which will last for months. The smaller clam of brasgfounders who work for factors-as distinguished from those who sell direct from their foundrles to the ironmongers and braziers of the country-are those who suffer chiefly by the *pparently trifling advances which from time to time take pace te price of copper. They are compelUed to buy ' from hand to mouth," and 'when a rise occurs, as in the present case, are unable to obtain a corresponding advance upontho prices of their manufactured articles. The tin wvare manufacture is moderately active, and participates largely in the late extensive orders received from Melbourne. The hollow ware in all Its branches is steady, and, as might he expected at this seson of the year, there is an increased cal for edged and all descriptions of husbandry tools. Most of our manufacturers engaged in this branch of local production are weU employed, and smiths' work generally may be termed good, if not absolutely brisk. More than one of our chief establishments engaged in the manufacture of husbandry machines and implements are prepaing for " show' at the various agricultural meetings held in the autumn, and this, beyond the usual work of the season, renders the workshops engaged in this branch of the hardware trade more than ordinarily busy. The reports from the manufac tuing distrivsi of Stafford. shire and Woroeeterahire continue, upon the whole, to be favourable. The various banking companies of Birmingham have this week resolved upon closing their establishmente at 4, instead, as hitherto, at 5 o'clook on Saturday afternoon. Some time ago a great portion of the merchants, factors, and manufatsurers adopted Friday instead of Saturday as pay day, and thus rendered unnecessay tha practice of keeping open tbe banks an extra hour on the latter day. The Birmingham and Staffordshire Gas Company, at their annual meeting held this wecek, declared a dividend of 21. lOs, on the original shares, ll. 6sa on the half-shares, and 4s. per share on the new shares, NOTTINGHIM, Sm.'y 5, The lace trade is quiet; but we are just on the eve of the autunut season, and manufacturers are sanguine as respects a good demand. The home trade is revivIng, anus this week thero has been rather more doing in goods for the home market. The demand for some descriptions of sUk goods is improving. Upon the whole, business, although quiet, is in a healthy condition. Cotton continues extremely deer, and in sUk there is vary little alteration. It is, however, probable, from the favourable accounts received of the crop in China, that this description of sllk wiU shortly be mo e.topurcbase. In the hosiery traie there is ieittle Mlteration; it anything, however, there is shade of Improvement. Mma ter, both hosiery silks and yarns, remain at an enormous price, and utterly preclude manufacturers creating stocks. Inteligence has arrived this week from New York of the capture of a Nottingham silk throwater named Baxter, who absconded about threo months ago, leaving liabilities to the amount of about 2.3,000Z. The career of this man was somewhat extraordinary. Some years ago he was in businees in the lace trade, and failed; after this he commenced In the sUk trade, and in a short timo erected a mill and employed a great number of hands in throwing silk. Just previous to his leaving Nottingham he purchaseda lar quantity of silk, giving three months' bills This silk he resold for cash and decamped with the money. Detective officers were sent after him by his oreditor and he was found in New York keeping a coffeehouse; Baxter delivered up 7S01 to the detectives. If posible be wiU be brought back to Nottingham, but at ppresent there are, i is said, some legal difficulties in the way. L OSE,SP.5 LECICESTEh', SEPT. 6. The demand for the home masrket continues. The goods are, however, ohiefly of an Inferior description. The warehouses have this week been tolerably busy in goods for home consumption, and, upon the whole, considering the extremely high rates at which both wool and cotton are selling the trade generaly lIs in a satisfactory condition. In the 1wool-market there is no change, material being fully as dear as last eek. Worted yarns oontinue also firm, fuly supporting the late advances, LEEDS, SEPT. 5. The woollen cloth trade continues steady, and the demand approximates closely to the supply. The chief complaint is, that with risung markets for wool, indigo, and oil, the prices obtainable by the manufacturer are not sufficiently remunerative. Henoe the clothiers are cueful not to increase their stocks. The problem as to prices for the manufactured article commensurate with the cost of the raw materials and the cplital and skill engaged in the manufacture is one which wiUl soon solve Iself. Without remuneration businesswill cease; but of that there is little fear, when the men who have to conduct that business are Englihm en, and (may we not say) especially Yorkshiremen. To-day's markets have been of a good average character, without any marked change. Winter goodsare the most saleable, but oi other usefu cloths some small lots were sold. Wools are firm in price, but the demand among the local dealers has not been very brisk during the week. HALIFAX, Sxpr. 4. The staple trade here has rather improved during the week. Orleans and Coburg cloths are in better demand, and in mixture goods a fair business is doing. Yarns and wools are steady as to price, and for the former there is a little better demand. Altogether there are signs in favour of a tolerably good fall trade. The staple trade of the worsd district continues in a satisfaotory condition. As regards piece goods there is a very fair inquiry, and manufacers who have taken the wise precaution not to speculate in the production of heavy stocks succeed in obtaining fully last week's quotations. In the merchants' warehouses there has been anaverage attendance of buyers, and in the majority of instances a seasonable trade is noticeuble. For worsted yans the spimers are again demanding an advance in price. They allege that the figurec which they are now enabled to obtain are not commensurate with the high range taken by the prices of combing wools, and, as a general rule, they dscline to eter upon new contracts where their enhanced pretensons are not acceded to; but there can be no queston that the currencies at present ruling Iafford an exceedingly narrowr margin for the mrofitsble employment ef framese; and, as a de41iae in the prbce of the rawf mater i conidered beyond the rg of probabilty, it is confidently felt by the spinmrs that an dvance must e'entually be obtai 4. Th engagements entered into for the supply of yarns, both for export and use in the home trade, are, oonsidering the present state of things, this week ouite heavy a wo mightb led to anticipate. Thero is little alteration to be noted either in the demand or valu of cottOn yarns; pris remain exceedingly firm, nad the business is not just now of a very extensive charActer. The wool-market is without material alteration. We have a satisfactory, though not to say brisk demand, for combing qualities, and the transations entered into, being Sill in most instance in oompliance with positive and im. mediate requirements, are on the whole to a good extent. The saplers exhibit great firmness in their demandz for high currencies, and the manifestation of this disposition prevents more wool from changing hands just now than iz absolutely required by the stplers for the completion of their running contranta. Clothing wools are without chan, the supply is limited, and prices are firmly supportedi. The Conucil of the Chamber of Commeroe for the Bradford and Halifax worsted district have at thber meeting this week had brought under their consideration the subjoet of the increasing competition experienced by our local trade with continental manufacturers, particularly in the finest classes of manufactured good. It appears from the staements advanced that for the past eight or ten years our local manufAceturern have suffered a gradual diminution of the trade in fine goods, which has been transferred to the continent to such an extent-said to be fuUy 25 per cent, of our former trade-as to afford a subject for momentoas conesideration. There has been at the late metropolitan wool sales, and especially during the last series, a great and an increasing oompetition for wools by the continental manufacturers, who secured the fincet sampleg for shipment to Belgium, France, and Germany. These continental manufacturers, h4ai puehawd wnd exportd tho loug-staplWd wwols] spI and weave them Into both plan and fancy fabric of the finest textu, aud then transthIp them to Enaland; ad in or oown markets are enabled to underaell the English manufacturer. An opinion was expressed that the secret of the foreign ranufactorera' succesg was the receipt of a bonau from their Government. It was urged that the Chamber should take the question into its fuU and serious consideraion,but an objection was edvancedthatany inteuference Iwqould be antagonistic to our free trade policy. It WrAs howrever, ultimately decided that the saggestion would be bese carried out hy the appointment of a committee of inquiry, which wras duly nomdinated, with Mr. Titus Salt as presidenlt.

LORD MELVILLEON TH C S. A dinner was given on Friday evenig at Dslkejtlk (oounty of Edinburgh to Mr. Dandas, of Arniaton, on the occasion of the birth of a son and helr. The Right Hon.. Sir George Clerk p-esided, and Among other present were V-oount Melsille,CommsndtngtheForoesin North Britain. Sir G. G. Montgomery, MP., Sir W. G. Craig, Mr. Pit% Dnndsa, Registrar-General of Scotland; Mr. Ingl, Dean of Faculty; Mr. Forbee Mackenzie, Mr. W. Dundas, &c. The CRAiRN, gae " The Army and Navy," coopled with the name of Lord Melville. He sid te neght now have hoped that the army, after their late servios in the Crimca, would haye some time to reposo in pece, but unfortunately they were again called upon to make stil greater efforts in their country's c-u. They had now to, go out to put dowrn a fonl rebellion in India, and he trusted by God's blessing that they would be sucessafl (load applause), and that they 'ould bring ondign punishment to bear upon the perpetrator of outrages on women and helpless children such as the imagination could socrcely concelve, and which r othing bnt the height of cruelty an of brtatelty could have suggested to any human beifg. ( A ppauoh) Lord ME:LvLLIx, In repl, said,-With rogard to the remarks of my right hon. friend conoerning India, I only wish I could say I entertain the hope thst we ad scn the worst. I an afraid that before the srvioes of our army are brought to a dose In India we must prepre ourselve for still worse caamitios than we have lredy suffered and, I fear, for losses of a severe character. It is not only thet we have to provide an army for puttlag down the rebellloa, but we have to occupy the country a well as have a foroe engaged inmoveablecolumns for the xuppreaionof therebellion in different districts, Thiswill require s.large force, and I am afraid such force ss wo hare yet wxn out In not adequate to the servioe that has to be performed. As almoot every available soldier that England can now' produce is on his way to that country, or Is engaged ix ur othaer poesssiosns, feel *ek if Englnd means to retain all her foreign poeaions, she must mainiain a mueh lurger army thin she has yet done. You cannot maintain these distint colonies without an adequate force not only to occupy them, but to defend them if neamary. Ships and soldiers you at this moment require with the most urgent neoessity, and I may take this opportunity of stating to you that ler Majer0y's Government has again thought it necessary to call for men to recruit the service, and a memorandum has jnst been issued by which *i9 Royal Highness the Commander.in-Chief offers a commina sion to any gentleman anxious to enter the army who can raise 100 mcn. These gentlemen must be examined as to their fitnes3 and qualification for tbo service, and must state the district m which they propose to raise themen; and I think the age is limited to fromlS to 23. Durn the Crimen war, when the militia was embodied, A large boy of men was raised by this means, and I hope that now, seeing what the emergency is, the loyalty and ptriotism of the cotntry will stir up young man to come forth and rally round the standard of Great Britkin, to reoover that country to England which thts rebellion has plcel in peril-I will not say taken from us, for I cannot bt beleve that the supremacy of England will be re-egta. blised aDdcl her domineon restored, and thit country become once more the bright gem in the British Crown which It has hitherto been. (Loud cheersm) The Right Hon. CxAm then propoeod the toast of the evenng, and adverted to the distinguished servio which the family of Arniston had rendered to Scotland, one member of that family suceeding another in the prmn cipal judicIal seats; and commented on the claims which the present head of the house had to such a compliment from his tenantry and friends, who entertained for him the higheet esteem and affection. A letter of apology was read from the Marquis of Dal. housis, whose estate is contiguous to Arniston, expressing ragre.at his absence. He said - " I heartUy wtsh I could be preest to effer my eongratulatous to you in pDo n. sd to eTIDoe my regpect and regr ma weU for yourself an foour family, ot which this Is the fourth oeretiounLnmy tlmeo bat I bare Deithr a lac to sand upon nor arolse to cbeer withLl. and, that beng no, I feel that the good wishes I hartily ofofr to yen and jors wUil be aooetod by you and by those who meet with you as a sUbetitate for my pPreee" After Mr. Dundas had replled several other toats were proposed, including the Duke of Bucoleuch, the Right Hon, Robert Adam Dundas Christopher Nisbbt Hamilton, MYP., a cadet of the house of Arniston, and Lord MelvlUe, hose grandfAther, the first Lord Mlelville, was also a younger son of the Dundas family. The noble Viscount, in acknowledging this further compliment, said-My friend hr. Ramsay, in proposing this toat, has alluded to my eorvices in terms be;ond any deeart of mine, and particularly to the occasion when I commanded the Bombay column in the Punjab. I must certainly congratulate myself on the excellent discipline manifested by that column; and whatever credit may be due to me in that matter, I can conscientiously say, was by my being most ably and zealously supported by the officers of that army. I do believe that if the same discipline had been in existance in Bengal, and if the sme attention to their duty had been paid by the European officers of the Bengal army this unfortunate mutiny would not have occurred. I am qmite unable to tel you the reason why different systems thould prevail In different presidencies. That has, uxfortunately,beein aLUowed to be the case, and as we see in Bengal with what disastrous recalts. A thorough investigation into the causes cf this unfortunate mutiny w1il necearily take plaoe inL the next esmion of Parliament, and of eouzse a very serious inquiry will be Institated as to the proper mode of re-organizing that army. We cannot retain our dominion in India without a native army. 1uropeans cannot do tE4e duty which the native troops are called on to perform; the climate will not admit of It. But how we can re-organize that ayrm so as to trust the natives, after what has oocurred, is more t a at this moment I can possibly venture to suggest, Meanwhile, a vary large European force wil neess. rily have to be maintained, and many duties hitherto performed by nativesmust be performed by them-thouh, I am afraid, at a great sacrifice of life; but that is unavoidable if we mean to maintain our supremacy in India. Lord Melville concluded by expreasing his re6ret that he had left India before his youg kinsmn, a younger brother of Mr. Dundes, now before Dli, arrived out. He had, however, pride and satisfaction in knowing from officers in his regiment (the 60th) how able an oficer and how attentive to his duties he was, and he only regretted that his wound in the leg should for the time prevent him from being " cede' as wel as "stLuda, and thus fulfilling the motto on his regx mental colours Among tho oonclu&dig toests Wa ts health of ' Sir George Clerk," proposed by the Den oE Faculty in an able speech.

ZONDON, MOViDAY, SgPTEMJBBB 7, 17. Among the conjectures or explanations suggested of the causes which may have been at work- to convert a well-paid and apparently faithfiul army into a swarm of murderous assassins the decay of professional sympathiea Wt*een officers and soldiers has been sometimes put forward. It is said that the officers of the Indian Army have assimilated themselves less than was formerly the case to the habits and customs of the natives, that they have maintaTned less personal communication with them, and, as a natural consequence, have lost much of the infiuencetheyonce possessed, and much of theinsight into native character which they thus obtained. Excepting, perhaps, in the latter particular. we are not inclined to think that any actual loss can have been sustained, but a letter which we publish this morning from an able and well-informed correspondent will explain how absolutely inevitable the change-whatever might be its results-had become, and how impossible it was to expect, in the present condition of eociety, that the Company's officer should live as his predecessors lived 40 or 50 years ago. In the days of our ancestors, when travelling of all kinds was but sparingly practised, when India was separated from England by a six months' voyage, and when its affairs were almost entirely removed from the general cognizance of the public at home, an appointment in the Company's service, whether civil or military, was accepted as involving something little short of expatriation for life. The cadet, upon arrival at AMadras or Ca!cutta, left English notions behind him, and threw himself at once into the ways of the new world to which he was introduced. Bis life *as exempt from the restraints which lhome society even then imposed, he surrendered himself without reserve to the fashions of the East, and there was some explanation, if not apology, to be found for the connexions which he usually formed. It can easily be understood how an intercourse of this kind between the natives and their riders might be regarded as productive of feelings in some respects advantageous to the political position of the latter ; indeed, our correspondent himself appears to admit that such was the case even while he deprecates the idea of repining at the change. We entertain, however, considerable doubts whether the assumption thus made has any substantial foundation. About the truth of the main argument,-viz., that the change referred to was simply an incident of advancing civilization, and, as such, far too beneficial to be opposed or lamented, there can be no question whatever. On no conceivable grounds could it be thought desirable to return to the Indian fashions of 60 years since. Neither as regarded his professional efficiency, nor as concerned his own prospects, was the Company's oflioer of those times so well situated as at present. Although that terrible malady which we now consider the peculiar scourge of the East was not then Inown, the chances of life, owing to the dissolute habits universally prevailing, were far less favourable than now, while we need do no more than point to the manner in which our countrymen have condluctd themselves during these atrocious mutinies to provethat in all the qualities which seciire good service to the State the officers of the IDdian Army are at least as eminent as they could ever have been before. If there is one fact, indeed, which this crisis has placed beyond doubt, it is tills. WVe hi ve observed, however, that we question the corrt ctness even of those views which attach any ad v aitage at all to such a species of familiarity be ween Euiglishmen and Hindoos as our correspondeiat has depicted; and we think we can justify our incredulity. In the first place, if this kind of interc(lurse carried with it any essential guarantees, there ought to have been no such things as mutinies, or apprehensions of mutiny, while it subsiated, whereas sve know very well that the allegiancie of the Sepoy in those days was sometimes bt.,ken, and more frequently suspected. Again, if close and kindly commumication with the natives could insure their fidelity, the result ought to be visible in exceptions at the present moment. We do not snppose our correspondent would insist on the particular form of connexion to which he refers as being eminently or exclusively serviceable. The conditions in question would, of course, be satisfied by any such intercourse as brought officers aud soldiers to a thorough knowledge of each other, and enabled both alike to appreciate each other's qualities and intentions. Now, this state of things, although not common to all the regiments of the Bengal Army, did undoubtedly exist in some battalions. Officers were to be found pomsessing not only as great an intimacy with the native character generally, but as familiar an acquaintance with their own men, as ever prevailed in times gone by. Moreover, there were the Irregular Regiments, commanded especially on the old-fashioned and patriarchal model, so that these, if the evil could be traced to the decay of military sympathies, ought to have been free from taint. Yet it has been found by actual trial that no qualifications, however endearing, saved European officers from the murderous onslaught of their men, and the Irregular Corps in too many instances, and with too little reluctance, have followed their brethren of the Line in the path of treason. One of the meet remarkable facts, indeed, in these shocking transactions is the reliance which officers seem to have placed up to the very moment of defection on the fidelity of their men. So far were they from standing aloof or isolated from their regiments, that they seem to have been possessed 'with the fimest and most implicit faith in their loyalty. They spoke of their men as people would speak of old and long-tried servants, confidently and boldly, deprecating suspicion, and begging that no measures of violence might be employed. It was to this credulity-seeminglyinexplicable,except on the assumption of constant intercourse between the parties-that the loss of life was owing at Jhelum; and in the very last letter received from the unfortunate garrison at Cawnpore the writer expressed himself as " putting all trust" in his Sepoys. As a final argument, too, on this point, we may observe that if the progress of civilization was indeed detrimental to iEuropean authority in India, the damage ought to be discoverable elsewhere than in Bengal, which is happily not the case. We believe, indeed, that the loss of influence attributed to the cause in question is mainly imaginary, and that the Indian officers as a body are not only superior to their predecessors, as our correspondent observes, in manners and attainments, but that they are at least equally well qualified to imprems the ascendancy of the governing race upon the native mind. If courage, ability, and self-possession in peril can invest men with any attributes of natural command, the title to snch prerogatives has unquestionably been established by our countrymen in the East. Into the observations of our correspondent respecting the origin of this traitorous conspiracy we do not propose to enter; but if the objects of the conspirators have indeed been facilitated' by any modern usages of the Indian Army, the cause must be sought for, not in the character or habits of the individual officer, but in ihe arrangements by which officers were withdrawn from their regiments altogether. Without assuming that a different system in this respect would have removed the disposition of the Sepoys to plot, we nmay certainly conclude that it would have rendered their plotting more difficult. It stands to reason that the proceedings of a thousand men are less likely to escape notice when they are superintended by 20 officers than when they are superintended by only 5. The officers were efficient officerssuperior, indeed, to those of former times, not only in principles and in behaviour. but in their knowledge of India, its institutions, and its languages. The fault-as far as fault in this respect extended-consisted in giving these officers too much to do, and in distributinjg their duties over too large a surface_ This, however, like other errors, we can no* understand, and we are as firmly persuaded as our correspondent himself that the atmosphere in the end will be purified by the tempest now raging, and that "the Government of India will be all the stronger "for this temporary derangement."
Shortly before the close of the Session Lord PAiMIURE took an opportunity to throw cold water on the recommendations of the Army Purchase Commission. It was scarcely to be expected that a report opposed to the published opinions of the COMMANDEB-IN-C}IEE and of the SECuSTARY for WVAx, himself would be cordially adopted, and the Indian crisis will supply a convenient excuse for postponing any practical decision. In time of war the numerous casualties which take place supersede the necessity of devising any elaborate system of promotion. It is in the stagnation of peace that selection becomes invidious, while seniority stops the way. On the other hand, a change might be most easily effected at a time wlhen the operation of purchase is partially suspended. The appointment of commanding officers by selection would be thought less obnoxious at a time when regiments are employed on active service. It is possible that by honest selections the authorities might even succeed in shaking the unanihous conviction of the Army that merit, in the language of the Horse Guards and of the War Department, is but a synonym for family connexion and for Parliamentary interest. The Crimean appointments have not yet been forgotten, but the Russian War must have originated a suspicion even in the highest quarters that ability and professional knowledge are desirable qualities in an officer. The comparatively honest administration of the Navy during the last few years has in some degree diminished the habitual disbelief of the profession in the justice of the Admiralty. Some of the opponents of purchase weaken their case by dwelling on the favouritism which occasionally influences regimental promotion. Mr. HIGoiNs, who has done good service in exposing many civil and military jobs, reminds the Com[nissioners how a young nobleman was thrust over Ithe heads of older and better soldiers by an in- genious process of exchanges, ending with a gratuitous company in the Guards; but it is evident that the same object might have been attained with even greater readiness under a system of selection. If seniority -were established every man must wait for his turn. The present rules of the Holse Guards allow a favourite occasionally to step out of the press and to re-enter by a side door further on; but the evil would be aggravated if precedence were awarded according to the mere discretion of the authorities. There is a difference between the advantage arising from superior skill in the game and a licence to move the chessmen about the board at random. The weight which attaches to the opinions of offlcers is somewhat weakened by their diposition to prefer the system which they find existing in their respective branches of the service. The Marines and the Artillery approve advancement by seniority, not according to regiments, but in a coDsiderable section of the Army. Indian officers find that it is desirable to buy off their seniors by a general contribution. With the Guards, the Cavalry, and the Line it seems that the "leap" frog" practice of purchasisg over the heads of others is at least not unpopular. The only proposition which unites all suffrages, from the COMM.AIDER-N-CHIMP to the humblest Ensign, it that selection would be odious or impracticable. The Duke of CAMBRIDGE is of opinion that nominal promotion by merit would soon end in habitual advancement by seniority, and it is certain that the establishment of strict seniority in regiments would instantly lead to the adoption of the Indian pracs tice of making up a purse for retiring officers. If it is intended that purchase should be really abolished, seniority must be calculated not by regiments but throughout the entire arm of the service. The most comprehensive argument in favour of the existing system will be found in the evidence of Lord Gimy. Mr. HiaGINs and Sir 0. TRxvxLYA forcibly point out the drawbacks to a practicewhich undoubtedly relaxes the professional character of the Army ; Sir G. BnowN, a thorough soldier, and an ex-Adjutant-General, is, perhaps, extravagantly sensitive to the jobbing propensities of the Horse Guards. Having lived and served with Frenchmen, the old General is little influenced by the arguments which are derived from the exaimple of continental armies. " I am not one of those," ho says, " who approve the dirt which has been "cast upon the Army." " I believe that our "officers-in fact, I know that our officers, are "better educated than any others that I have " come across as a body. I had 6,000 men at " Gallipoli, and General CAN?RoBEoT and General " BosQuT were there with 22,000, and there3 "was not a single officer or man among those "22,000 Frenchmen who could speak a word of "English or read it; and I was accordingly obliged "towrite, and get myAide-de-Camp to translate my "letters to those officers into French." "I do " not think the French Staff officers were of that " very superior class that has been generally as" serted and believed in this country." " It is " quite a mistake to suppose that the French have "any officers such as the old Marshals left; with "regard to General officers, they are not a bit "better off than ourselves." In conformity With these opinions Sir G. Baowx is a thoroughgoing supporter of the existing system of purchase to its fullest extent. Some witnesses attach considerable importance to the power of the COMMiNDEE-tx-CnIxF to insist that an incompetent officer shall retire by the sale of his commission. It is not desirable to make a retiring pension the reward of inefficiency, and it would be unreasonable and harshtodismiss an honest and well-conducted veteran without any provision for the future. The opportunity of recovering his purchase-money solves all difficulties. Sir C. TnzvnrYAw says that unpaid services are always costly to the employer, but the compulsory termination of the engagement is certainly facilitated by the knowledge that it has been practically gratuitous. Officers cannot be pitied for fheir pecuniary loss when they are no longer allowed to serve at their own expense. The edo of the Horse Guards on the proposed purchase of a Lieutenant-Colonelcy ought to furnish a sfficient security against gross incompetence, but the commanding officers of regiments may be expected to possess higher qualifications than the mere negation of unfitness. The advocates of purchase and of seliority constktly forget. the analogy whicexhats between the land and sea services. A judicious selection of Lieutenant-Colonels in command would produce an incidental advantage by accelerating promotion. Field officers who found themselves passed over would in almost all instances retire by the sale of their commissions. The example of the Navy, of the Marines, and of the Ordnance Corps proves that promotion in time of peace, if it is not facilitated by the operation of purchase, must be kept from stagnating at a considerable expense to the nation. The halfpay of the Artillery alone amounts to 32,0001. a-year. Officers in the Indian Army retire on full pay after a certain period of service, but the non-effective portion of the establishment is eomparatively small. Sir C. TnXVELYAN injures the cause of which he is in other respects a powerful supporter by undertaking to maintain the paradoxical proposition that the purchase of commissions imposes a burden on the nation. On the other hand, it is shown by the condition of the non-purchasing services that the Army may be officered by gentlemen when the sale of commissions is rendered impossible. The cost of a scientific education, and the expenses imposed on the family of a naval cadet, produce a similar effect to the exaction of a few huudred pounds for the purchase of an Ensigncy. The social position of a Post Captain or of a Colonel of Artillery is fully equal to that of a Colonel in the Line. The adoption of the plan proposed by the Conmmissioners can in no way diminish the existing securities against military interference with political liberty. LieutenantColonels nominated by the Horse Guards will have previonsly given very sufficient pledges to the constitution in the form of purchase-money paid for their earlier commissions.
It is said that 3Ir. BucHA?- ME is resolved to put down Mormonism,-at any rate, to break up the commtunity at Utah. There will be great diffLculties, owing Wo the weakness of the Federal Government, half of whose force is reported to have deserted already. But the new PRESIDENT is a resolute man when he has nundertaken a thing, and we hope the days of this abomination are now cotunted. We certainly ought to wish for this, for it must be eonfessed that we are a good deal concerned in the growth of Mormonism. It is a fact that tho majority of the community-Mlr. CARVALITO says nine-tenths-are English, Scotch, and Welsh. How is this ? Who is responsible for this t What have our orthodox parish priests been doing, and what have our orthodox Dissenting ministers been doing, that their own congregations have been the feeders of such an enormity as this ? It is a very poor consolation, but, perhaps, it is some little consolation, to find that with respect to our own people fanaticism has had more to do with the current to this wretched delusion than vice. It would, indeed, be dreadful to think that so many thousands of our men, and especially our women, had designedly, and with their eyes open, joined a system of the grossest polygamy. But it is only just to say that to a great extent this was not the case. The new religion was, indeed, itself a sensuality, but it was not joined by the great mass under that idea. The prophots had the wickedness to disguise its grossness t1il their miserable victims had got so deeply imbedded in the system that they could not extricate themselves. It is a fact that, in order to be beforehand with report, they actually forged a servicebook, professing to be the service-book of their religion, and containing, anioDg other offices, a marriage office, framed on the ordinary principle of monogamy. What, then, was the inducement to this deluded crowd to join the new religion ? It seems to have beenf mainly the extraordinary proplhetic show and pretence of the Monnonite imposture. The subject of prophecy has ever since the Reformation had an extraordinary hold ovar the minds of religious people in thiu country. The Ptritans were mad upon it. They dreamt of the battle of Armageddon, of GOG and MAGOO, of the seven seals ad the seven trumpets, of the star which was called Wormwood, and the angel whose name was Abaddon, till, wound up at last to frenzy, they thought tho world was coming to an end, and that all these mysterious events were close at hand, every military officer of any distinction imagining that he was the person who was to have the especial honour of capturing the great dragon and delivering the saints. These speculations have never lost their charm among us, and, though we do not make s-ch warlike prophets as our Puritan ancestors, prophecy is still the fashion. The religious world throws itself into the fature, and fixes the era of the millennium with untiring ingenuity. No two commentators agree on their date, but this very diversity gives a zest to speculation. It is really extraordinary what stuff comes out yearly in the shape of comment on those perts of Scripture; what curious and wild contortions and grimaces prophecy performs Under the guidance of its interpreters. All this is seriously written and seriously read. Men of education, scholars, Acadericians please themselves with laying out the mysterious future with as much exactness as if they were laying out a Dutch garden or drawing a figure in geometry. They are as familiar with the heavenly Jerusalem as they are with the ground plan of their own houses. The pleasuro is that of a Chinese puzzle. There is endless room for ingenuity in different juxtapositions of tho various pieces, the pieces here being the different figures, types, numbers, and personages of this mystical department. They shake their kaleidoscope, and look through it to see what they have got, and they shake it again and look through it again, till they have got some figure symmetrical enough. Every remarkable event of the day is sure to be followed by a general shaking of the prophetic kaleidoscope, because it must be brought into the figure. If a King falls or a King rises there are three or four books in the course of as many weeks to prove his connexion with one of the horns of the beast, and the coup d'eat of Louis NArPOLON produced a general excitement in the prophetic world. Such being the prophetic bias of many industrious writers, imagine this influence at work in a low and uneducated class. Imagine these rude and uncultivated minds intent, so far as they think of religion at all, upon the prophetic aspect of it, full of ideas of a milennium and a sort of earthly paradise, which ihey have caught up from the glowing page of Old Testament prophecy, and which, literally interpreted, does bear that meaning, however a more refined and a truer interpretation may spiritualize it. They read in the Old Testament prophecy of a region where men shall no more hurt or destroy, where there shall be no violence and no want, and they give to all this a mnaterial interpretation. Under such impressions they will be very likely to be dupes of designing impostors, who come to tell them about a land beyond the seas where all is peace and plenty,-no oppression, no extortion. If this was the picture of the Mormonite paradise which was given them, its gross features being kept back, their faith in it was, of course, gross credulity; but it is a credulity which our learned and educated zealots who run mad on this very subject of prophecy themselves have no particular right to censure. They have set the example. When educated men and even clever men run into such extraordinary follies and dreams on this subject, it i is not very surprising if a coarse, illiterate class, ,as gone a, step further, and not only indulged the dream, but aced upon it. It is a very good maxim that no one class in society errs without the rest being in some degree implicated. The Prophetic mania in our religious world is more or less responsible for the AMormonite emigration from these islands. This extravagant adventure is only a coarse reflection of that wild prophetic speculation in which so large a part of the religious public has indulged. The Mormonite emigrant went in quest Of a sort of earthly paradise; he thought the millennium had come, and that he would take the earliest advantage of it. We are speaking, of course, of the dupea of Mormonism, not of its prophets, and of the fanaticism of the system, not of its grossness and sensuality. These wretched dupes have been prepared for their delusion by the extravagance of their betters. The ridiculous brochures that sell by thousands if they only hazard a new prediction, the nonsense which is read with avidity on any subject connected with prophecy, is the upperclass shape of 3Iormonism. We rush into a visionary future as a relief either from the inequalities of the present seene, or its difficulties, or its dulness. This has made the Millennarian and it has made the Mormonite. The Mrmeonite is the English form of Socialist. Both aim at utopias, cnly one in connexion with prophecy, the other in' connexion with social progress and the political regeneration of the world.
THE BRAAR GA21REprvr. The annual muster of Highland clans to celebrate the "Braemar gathering" took place on the lawn in front of the old Castle of Mar, in presence of the Queen and Court, on Thursday. Preparations of a very unusual character were made for the present occasion, and were favoured by the weather, which had been most inauspicious In tho morning, but cleared up at rnoon. During the previous day an immenso number of strangers had assembled In and around the village of Charlesto wn, and from an early hour onThursday morning crowds of pedestrians were wending tbhir way towards the Dcene of the gathering. The first muster of the clans in order consisted of the Lorrach Highlanders, or Craiglevar men, tnuder their chief, Sir Charles Forbes. of New. They numbered 130 stalwart fellows, alU equipped In the Highland garb. Sir Charles, witsh Sir William Forbes, of Crmigievar, and Colonel Teesdale (one of the heroes of Kar%) had led a march from Strathdon to Invercautld on the Wednesday, halting opposite to Balroral, and bivouackiug for the night in tents at Invercauld. This clan gatbered in front of the Inverald Arms at Castletown on Thursday at noon, and were stoon toined by SO of the Iuvercauld men, or Farquharson Highlanders, under their chiefs-viz., Captain Farquharson, of the Scotch Fusileer Guards, and his brothers. The next munter was that of the Dug llighlanderr, who were headed by the Earl of Fife, Viscoant Macduff, and officered by Captain Kennedy Erskine, Mr. Brooke, and Mr. G. Line For. The Earl of Airlie wa Palso present at the muster, with a goodly number of the Airlie Highlanders, and the whole, with banners flying and pipes playing, miarched to the Casle park, where they formed two sides of a square, within which the games came off. The gathering was much larger than it had been on any former occasion, and the appeanece of the Elighlanders was exceedingly imposing. n the green emibankment around the Castle reserred places were occupied by the famniliee of the aristocracy who were present. Mr. and Mrs. Farqnharson sbowing everT kindness to their distinguished gnests. On the brow of the bank sofas were placed for the Queen and Court, from which a commanding view of the whole scene, as well as the surrounding country, wsA obtained. The games commenced about 2 o'clook, and at 3 the Queen drove up to the Caatle, and wa, receivod with long-continued applause. Her Majesty wore the Royal Stuart Tartan, Ind t.he Prince Coneort was dreseed in the Highland prb. The games consisted of the nsnal routine of throwing the stone, putting the ha'i,mer, and tossing tbe caber, with seeing and dancing. It will serve to show the strength of ,ic of someof these Highlanders when we statethat a stone weighing 28jlb. was thrown by Gretor M'Gregor, from Glenfhhie, 25 feet 5 iniches; and that Williamt Mt'Hardy, of Strathdon, threw a bammer of 161h. 72 feet 6 inches; these throws g.i the firat prizes. This same M'Eardy threw the large stone 27feet6tnche, but as he had been a firstprize man before he could only be allowed a medal iu the present contest. The danoes consisted of the Strathspeys and the sword daneo, which were spiritedly contested, and drew forth from ller hlajesty Rqeoint commendation. Before the gamses were well through tho weather changed for the worse, and tbe Queen had to take shelter in the Castle, which was very tastefully decorated wvith flowers and evergreens, and soon nrfter tho Court left and the HigRlanders roturned otO tilhe vili70e, Whlet they wero liberally entertamned by thleir chiefl III the evening thore was a ball in the Castle, w. hich 'eau cr ,,ed as usual, and continued to ap earlylhour ia thexuseruleg, Tlle Su bstan~ta IFe~islts '^t hihs gathoring will bi a -nm siderable aiddition to the funds of the benevolent soct.iy ' the interstss e wluih it is chiefly intended to subeego
THE INDIAN IANSURBECTIO2. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Among the many conjectures made respecting the cause of the Bengal mutinies an assertion has more than once appeared, stated in pretty positive terms, that it is the inefficiency of the oPicers and their want of sympathy with the natives under them which have led to the deplorable results the papers now teem with. It is not simply to refute this assertion that I novw write, because events have already proved its faUacy. It has now come to light that the mutiny is, in fact, an insurrection, fomented by the deep-laid intrignes of those who have suffered by recent acts (strictly just and legal of tbemselves) of the Indian Government, and springing from convictions which no amount of popularity in regimental officers could have combated or neutralized the effects of. It is not therefore, I repeat, so much to refute the above assertion that I address you as to offer a few observaiions on a fact I am ready to admit,-the want of sympathy between British officers and the Sepoys under them,-and to leave you and your readers to decide whether suchi vant of sympathy is creditable, or the reverse, to the former. In the " good old days," when the pagoda tree bore fruit and the voyage from England to India was a business of six to eight months, the " Company's servant" settled himself down in his Presi. dency as in his future home. He ate, he drank, and was merry, and when sated with the rough companionship of his mewsmates (for a precious rough set were our forefathers) he looked about for domestic enjoyment; and, because English ladies were in those days few and far between, he betook himself, in nine cases out of ten, to the Houris of the land, and in their arms forgot more and more the ties that should bind him to his home, the restrictions that should be observed by a gentleman, and the duties that are imperative on a Christian. Sir, picture to yourself an Indian of the old school. He is lolling on his sofa or on two chairs, arrayed in shirt and pyjamas alone (tbough it be long past noon), under a pimkha, close to a tatty, a hooka in his moubth a jorum of brandy-and-water in his hand, and his " beebee" by his side or squatted on the floor, with a host of her native relatives, and a rising brood of calf-skin-coloured children around. Let the years pass, and look at the Indian officer again through the medium of the overland passage, the medium of quick and frequent intercourse with his mother country. He may be dissipated, deep in his tailor's books-but he is an Englishman in appearance, though of the fast sort; and he would just as soon think of congregating with jackals as passing the livelong day with Naiich girls and t;heir relations. It is easy to see the first specimen must be the favourite among natives, but whether it be desirable to gain native affection by returning to such a happy state it must remain for society and the public to decide. I have ilustrated, of course, extreme cases; but a mean would give, I suspect, a result more favourable to the Indian officer of 1857 than the one of 1817. Men now go out to India with some education; even cadets who come out direct pass some examination; while among those who have been through Addiscombe and Chatham, as well as among members of the civil service, persons will be found of acquirements second to none. This was not the case in former years. Our forefathers were for the most part coarse and uneducated. The soldiercould drink, swear, and fight, and the civilian was a mere tradesman. And, though the rough-andready style of their acts may excite admiration in some, I do not believe they possessed a jot more true energy than their more polished successors. The vast improvement of late years in the tone of the Company's service, in the style of its members, and especially among its military officers, has been universally remarked and commented upon. And it is strange that people should now seek in that very improvement the source of ev;ls so direful as these murderous mutinies. Yet such is the fact, and these commentators do indiroctly desire the British officer in India to retrograde in these times of improvement, to divest himself of English ideas and labits, and to relapse into the disgusting condition I have above endeavoured to depict of an " Old Indian." It is unfortunate that advancement and improvement and closer connexion with a people among whom our lot is cast cannot go hand in hand; but it is not the less a fact. The Hinadostanee, be he Mussulman or be he Hindoo, is a creature to whom change is unknown; he is a perfect fixture, and as lines springing from a point, and not paraUel, diverge more the more they extend, so after years will place a wider gulf between this peculiar people and the English who rule over them, and to tax the latter with inefficiency for results which the Almighty alone can govern is unjust to the last degree. From these remarks, imperfectly as they are worded, is it not easy to see that the volcano which has now burst forth m.tst have exploded in the common course of events? WVhen we first took India, or, more historically speaking, when we first commenced to reign there as masters, tardy communication with England unanglicized the minds of our officials. We gave in to the natives. We adopted in a measure their habits, their ideas, their dress. We never thought of educating them. They uneducated us. But when the irresistible advancement of later years spread into the land, when education, little by little, forced its way into those reaims of ignorance and conceit, there remained to the darkened Eindoo or the bigoted Mussulman but one of two courses,-to become a convert himself, or to get rid of the instruments of conversion. As regards the Hindoo, this will be readily understood when it is known that the " Shastras," or Hindoo Scriptures, are not confined to religious subjects, but are a code embodying the entire Hindoo system of astronomy and geography; that there is scarcely a passage in our expo3ition of those sciences which does not utterly refute the "Shastras ;" and that therefore to teach that theearth is a globe, that it is divided into so many continents, that it revolves around the sun, or that an eclipse is occasioned by the shadow of a bearenly body, is as much to strike at the root of the Hlindoo faith as denying the existence of the Messiah would be to call in question the Holy Bible. In proof of this assertion I have only to point out the notorious fact, that the educated portion of the Bengal race consists at present of men who are of no zeligion, -that is, of no revealed or traditional religioin, but either Deists or Materialists. These gentlemen adopt partly the European dress, drive about in gay carriages or gigs, drink freely of champagne, and partake, anathcnua maranathil, of beefsteak and oyster sauce ! The recent rapid increase of this class mnst have long ago struck the bigoted uneducated Hindoo with apprehensions of the approaching downfall of Elindooism; and when, in addition, it is borne in mind that the Government of India, determined to deal evenhanded jnstice to aU classes of its subjects, recently passed a law rescinding the Flindoo law which deprives a convert from Hindooism of all succession to hereditary property, and thus released him from the talons of the Brahminical priesthood, it is not difficilt to understand that every Brahmin in the country was ripe for an effort to check the inevitable impending fal of his religion. As regards the Mussulman, he who does not know that the followers of this persuasion have ever to a man burned with hatred against us knows little of that portion of our Indian snhjects. So bitter is this enmity that it is matter of wonder it has not long ago overcome the want of unanimity for which Orientals are noted, and, instead of bursting forth in some grand explosion, has contented itself hitherto with a few frantic but limited mcidutes, as in the case of the Moulavies in Bengal and the Moplas in MNadras. So far we deal with facts ; beyond this is mere conjecture, which inquiries already set on foot in India will establish or refute; and these c.njectu res range themselves thus:- From the time of his first sulbjection to the British rule the Mahomedan, like a wounded tiger in his lair, or a baffled spider in his web, has lain smouldering away, so to say, vwith fiendish hate, and a fierce longing for revenge, strengthened by the deep enmity towards all of other creeds taught bim by his faith. Forming, however, but a portion of the population of India, and having ages ago rendered himself odious to the Hindoo' from whom no co-operation coul I be hoped for, he has remained comparatively tranquil, biding his time-watching hour long the Christian and the Hiindoo would reside quietly together. After an interregnum in which the former does nothing but scrape together rupees and acqarite territory,the necessity for ainfriorath7iq, what we possess getting itxsmWhuilc,-the l ,uLnve in the right direction is taken by the abolition of Sutte. The MIusulman we can fancy pricking up hi" earzatthis, but for so horrible a rite there are fewr advoat"g among the Eindoon, and the memaure passes quietlI It is followed after tome yeara by the withdxra oi Government from all counexion with th` vilUaouj idolatries of Jugoernauth and of Gyajee. ThIS produces some discontent, for Hmincoos js well as Buddhists dearly love the countenance of t«e sovereign power to their religious oeremonieL All this time eduication is beginning to make iself fe'. The wonders of truth become more sad mord irresistible, and then comes slowly impinging upon Brahminical consciousemss the rapid bspred of net idem and opinions amoxng the hitherto bigote Bengalees, and their cou%equent secosmu fron, Elindooism. The Brahmin bas become moro roady to fraternire with the Moslem I But hitherto ff Government has kept itself rigidly aloof from teacher and disciple. Its apparent want of sympathy witbL converte ha attractei anim version in England, and it is at length forced to interfere by enactng tvwo laws,-one to release the }lindoo widow from 1he cruel fiat of perpetual celibacy, the other to protect the convert from Hindooiam from the spoliation of his property. The Hindoo law, it must be remembered, prohibited tbo marriage of Eindoo viddows,and disinherited the seceder from the Endoo> faith. These last acts calied, doubtlels, a deep en. Fation and formed assuredly a strong argument for the Moolem to bring forward in urging the Hind0o to rep~elthethreatened downfall of hiscreed; andwhejm the unfortunate cartridge affair occurred the mateh was applied to a mine which had been-loug,xilnetpr loading, and the Miissulman wrs. enabled to'put his diabolhcal machinlery into movement, secure of tfia co-operaion of the indoo T eat his plots aue not aucceeded in shaliing the Government iFa cause of thanksgiving to God I do not thik that the true charactr of the Mahomedan bas ever been dnly appreciated in, India. Wherever this infernal ect haa beesff, fered to congregate batred and disaffection towsrd Christianity and tbe british rule have been ceptDalive, and simmering, a it were, like a cauldron over a fire. Moorshedabad (comparatively clo to Calcutta) has always been a nest of lurlking traitors, Patna and Daoca hotbods of fanatic discontent, and in Delhi and Luck-now at no time has it been safe for an unarmued European to be foundalone. It is fervently to be hoped that Government will now see to the utter dispersion of this dangerous crew. A' the beat-they are but usurpers in Hindostan, and it behoves us to destroy every trace of royalty or nobility to which they Ia claim, and which they ever have made anad ever wil make a nucleus for bloody murders and rebellion. That the Government of India will be all the stronger for this temporary derangement I feel certain.. Its (Bengal) officers will have learnt the true, value of " high-caste" men, and we shal have reRiments formed'of really hard-working ad ueful soldiers, instead of the conceited scoundrels whom we have been for years paLipering and rpoilingvillains who refuse before the enemy to dig a trench because the shovel is an ignominious tool for the " Ehetrec," and who make themselves useless frorn inanition on service because a- Brahmin may not eat cooked food with his sacoutrements on. Away with tho rabble I and in enlisting Sikhs, Ghoorkas, and Doshads, let ui get that Anglicized feeling into our regiments which makes the Bombay and Mladras armies more relly useful than the Bengal troops, though inferior perhaps n both physiTte and morale. And, finslly, let Government, heedlees of mob orators in Englmnd, refrain from extending to the dark, desigaing Hindostanee the saume liberty aud equality that it confers on the British subject. Most especially I refer to the " i berty of the press"-an act of Sir Charles Metcalfe, which wa3 a real boon when limited to the EngliAh newspapers, but a most pernicious erxr when extended to mendacious natives Toe assertion that these distarbances arise from the inefficiency of the Bengal military officers is founded apparently on the fact that they were originally restricted to the native soldiery, bat those who reason thus seem blinid to the fact tha tfor treason to prosper it must do so throughthe army. No human being would be so rash as to commeneo a revolution through the instrumentality of unwarlike peasants; ard, in the same way, no Zemindar, Nawab, or Rajah was prepared to raise the standard of rebellion till he bad seen Government stripped of the means of tinnediate retaliation by the disaffection of iis ia 4 e Thai only a few have now doue so is probably owing to the fact that the most powerful among them are the best informed, and foresee in the vast resources of the British Governtmeut an effectual barrier to their secret wishes. It has struck some also as a significant proof of inefficiency in the Bengal Government that Bombay and Madras have not joined in the mutiny. That the reins of discipline have been held tighter in those presidencies than in Bengal (where too much consideration and forbearance have been practised to all classes) cannot be denied, but it is quite unfair to attribute to that alone the tragedy which is now enacting. We must make ailowrances for the difference of mate6rid of the several armies. The Madras and the Bombay men are not equal in phys;iqe or in worale to the up,~ country Hindostanee, and wouild probably under no excitement have shown tr-e daring which the Bengal mutineers have evinced in the face of Europeans. Atrocities certainly were once committed by the first-named in Vellore, bnt .he outbreak there wad quito unlike the organized resistance shown at Delhi. MIoreover, the sieds of dlisaffection may not probably have been cast to the south of Bengal, where the machira-ions of treason have been restricted for reasons time alone can divulge. And, lastly, it alone can reveal whether f'reigm Powers have had any hand in this dreadful but impotent outbreak. BItt i3od forbid that the blood of the innocent children and the helpless women that has flowed so wautonly from the unpitying knife of the INWsnilman should hereafter be laidatthe door of tb., Ciristian. Blood of the innocent ! Useleswly as lavii I y has it streamed to the feet of those who never knew niercy I But, prAse be to Beaven, we caun 'i the Psalmist exclaim, "Thou hast girded mie Nvith strength unto the battle; Thou shalt thrisw down mine enemies under me."

SECOEND EDITION. THE TIMEsOFFICU, Monday Mrin. EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris corretpondent, dated yesterday (Sunday), 6 p.m.:- About this season of the year people have genetally htad such a glut of politics that they gladly turn their attention to subjects of a different nature. With the exception of the Indian insurreotion, lwlich has been a godsend to the Paris journals, a large portion of whose columns have of late been -aimost daily devoted to it, the Camp of ChW'ons is the novelty of strongest interest. It is established In a vast plain, about 12 miles to the north of the town. The land there is of little product or value, .znd 10,000 heetares (about 25,000 acres) have been Ipurchased by Government. This extensive tract will admit of the convenient establishment of a very large body of troops, and includes, moreover, a spacious manceuvring ground. The Emperor, who is greatly pleased with the locality, and who takes a strong interest in his Guard, has jast issued another general order, of a technical nature, prerscribing certain rules to be observed in the evolutions. The Mosniteur de VArmge and various correspondence from the camp give details of its arrangements. The Emperor's head-quarters are -established on an eminence, commanding the camp, and facing to the north-west. Three wooden -dhueks have.been erected there; the centre one -contains the Emperor's private apartments;* the tw-o others dining and drawing rooms. Two -double huts have been fitted up for guests. Other huts, in rear of these, comprise a printing establishment, telegraph office, kitchen, stables 1or 200 horses, store-houses for forage, lodgings :For servants, &c. All the buildings are raised -one metre above the earth, are of elegant appearance, and very comfortable. Between the two lines which they form are the tents of aides-de-camp and orderly ofiicers, and of the soldiers attached to their particular service. Groups of fir tress give a shady and agreeable aspect to the collection of buildings, which are arranged in a quadrilateral form, 250 metres wide and 150 deep. The head-quarters -of General Regnault de St. Jean d'Angely, who officiates as Major-General, are about half- -n-mile to the right of those of the Emperor. The -camp, which fronts the Imperial head-quarters, is an irregular polygon, with protruding and receding angles; on three sides it is bounded by small rivers. On the right of the camp, and in the vicinity -of watec for the hormes, the artillery and General ZAorris'E three brigades of cavalry have established themselves. In rear of the artilery of the Guard are some artillery and engineers of the line, the Ivaggon train, the slaughter-houses, &c. Each tent -Contains 10 infantry men or eight cavalry soldiers. 'he Generals, with their aides-de-camp and staff, -encamp in rear of the troops under their command. In front of the lines of soldiers' tents are rows of {tuts for kitchens, and in front of these are mess huts for the officera, who take their meals together, -on the English system. In rear of the centre of -each division is a hospital hut, making up 100 beds ;Finally a railroad, nearly 16 miles long, and which 'iU have been constructed iu less than two months -and a half, will shortly connect the camp with tho Great Eastern line. The usual train of camp foUowers, sntlers, aud -dealers in drink are, of course, already gathered together in the vicinity of this great military rendezvous. The French soldier, true to his habit of Winding a nickname for everything, has already coa1ferred on the principal assemblage of these itinerant ;{ehops the unflattering epithet of Coqguiarille. The Dld Criuean amiusement of amateur theatricab is revived at the ChMons camp. The night before last the 1st regiment of Grenadier3 of the Guard were to -open their Th&dtrc du Primce imperial. The infant Prince is on the strength of that regiment, to which till the actors and actrcsss belong. The piece announced was the celebrated Saltimbanqupes, immor4alizedby Odry. Thepricesofadmission areadapted to -nilitary purses, and the private soldier enters on ,paymeut -.f one sou. Shooting at targets will be another pastime of the camp. The Emperor will give prizes, and, it is said, will distribute them with his own hand. The manceuvres of the troops have as yet been confined to divisions and brigades. The vreather this month has been hitherto rather wet, and on Friday a deluge, which descent.ed just as the troops were going out to exercise, compelled them to return to their tents. Despatches from MIadrid announce that the :Spanlsh Government has sent orders to suspend the preparationls that were in progress in some of the 4spanish ports for an expedition against Mexico. They add that the difference between the two Powers is to be settled by arbitration, not by mnediation. Great Britain and France are to be the arbi. tratoxs, and, in case of need, Bavaria is to be called -in as umpire. The Madrid newspapers, whose ranks have been thinned a little by the recent law on the press, have raised their terms of subscription. OnI the 31st ultimo orders were given to aU the journals not to reproduce a correspondence from Paris, Vublished by The Times, and relating to Spanish .politics. The Timnes was seized in the reading xooms. On the following day both Tlhe Times and Galigpnani were seized. A letter from Lisbon says that the Duke de Rianzares has purchased the -Cintra Rtilroad. On the other hand, a statement -that has appeared in the papers, to the effect ithat Queen Christina had boaght an estate in Portugal, is positively contradicted by the Epoca. The Queen visits the churches daily. Her confine4nent is not expected to take place until the first week in November. The iFord announces, on the strength of a deOpatch frcm Trieste, the dismissal of Redschid Pasha frcrm his new office of Presideat of the Tanzimat. If true, this is another blow for poor Lord Stratford. She Russo- Belgian journal gives uo details on the subject, not being, it says, in possession of any. Where is no other intellgence of interest from the lBast to-day, excepting that the Moldavian elections are not expected to take plaea until the beginning -of October. For this postponement no political reason is assigned. It is said to have been decided upon, in order to give time for certain crops to bo got in, so that the rural population may not be interrupted in important labours by the business and e)xcitement of an election. The Cuant and Countess Walewski left Paris yesterday for Biarritz. Before his departure, the Clount had several important diplomatic conferences. He will return in time to acooupany the Emperor to Stuttgard, and attend the interview with the Emperor Alexander, at which it is said that other crowned heads will be present. The iuterview itself arises out of invitations from the King of Wurtemberg. Although it has been said that the Empress -of Russia wouldgo toStuttgard, this appearsuncertain. It is stated that one of the best French artists has been engaged by the Emperor to go to the -capital of Wurtemberg, and execute a picture, wepresenting the meeting between the two Emperors. Colonel Ribourt, first aide-de-camp of Mlarshal M1andon, has arrived in Paris charged with a cominission to the Minister of War. The M1arshal 3himself is at present in the departmeut of the Istere, aand will not go to the ChOlons camp until about the aniddle of this month. General M'Uahon, who has arrived in France from Algeria, is expected there Fibout the 20th inst. A medal has been struck at the Paris mint commemorating the inistaUation of the camp. Talking of medals, that of St. Ielena. is to be seen in Paris on the breasts of a fev sexage. narians. It is rather a heavy looking affair,, attacised to a pretty red and green ribbon. The camp of ChOlons is expected to last about six weeks. Before finally quitting it the Emperor will probably come for a few days to Paris. Deepatches have been received from M. de Bouzet, Governor of New Caledonia, by which he informs the Government that he was busy with the necesary arrangements for the reception of political prisoners at the Island of Pines. The Emperor has provisonally suspended the execution of a decree that had been prepared, establishing free trade in butcher's meat in Paris. A report on the subject, addressed to His Majesty by the Prefect of Police, is understood to be the cause of the suspension. Extensive changes are expected shortly t'o take place among the prefects of departments. AUSTRIA. (FROM Oia OWN CoRnsroNrNT.) VIENNA, SzPT. 4. The fearful atrocities committed by the rebellious Sepoys have excited the greatest indignation in this empire, and the British public can hardly be more impatient than is the Austrian to learn that the insurgents have been punished according to their deseeta. Almost all the leading orgaus of the Vienna press have contained leaders on the state of affairs in India, in which full justice has been done to the heroism of the British troops ia India, and to the exertions of Her Majesty's Government to relieve them from their perilous position; but the Oeste7yeichische Zentmng, which-isthe property of some of the leading men in the finan cial world, has an article on the subject that was written in a very different spirit. Experience teaches us that we frequently learn more from our enemies than from our friends, and an extract from the leader in question will, therefore, be given. After some extremely flippant remarks on the British press, the writer for the OesterreidhiscUe Zeitung says:- " The cry for vengeance, which was raised in England as soon as the cruelties committed by the Indian mutineers became known, was but natural. Women and children oan cry for vengeance, bat men can do more. It is a remarkable fact that not one band of volunteers has yet offered to proceed to the seat of war. The universities, the public schools, the factories, the cottages of the peasants, have not Fent forth one man with his gun or sword in his hand. In any other country thousands would have been carried away by their feelings, and have offered their services at such a highly critical moment. When the United States were at war With Mexico ten timos as many volunteers presented themselves as could be accepted. Not only young men belonging to the first and richest families, but even gray-headed fathers of families hurried to the scene of action and served in the ranks. The taste for deeds of arms is almost extinct in the European branch of the Anglo-Saxon race. It is only for lucrative appointments that there is a superabundance of applicants. The lower classes, when enlisted and paid, do what they are bid, but when the times are prosperous and wages high recruits are not to be found. In fact, the English army has almost become a myth." The article from which the foregoing is extracted has given so little satisfaction here, that several persons have requested me to state that it was written by a naturalized subject of the United States, and not by an Austrian. As everything connected with India must necessarily be of interest it is not necessary to apologize for laying before you some news forwarded to this city from Patna by a Roman Catholic Bishop. On the 3d of July the house usually inhabited by the bishop and the cathedral were attacked by several hundred Mahomedans. The Bishop had gone some days previously with the school children and orphans to a village at no great distance from Patna, but Dr. Lyal], who with a detachment of troops endeavonred to save the cathedral from the fury of the populace, was shot, and bis body cut tn pieces& Several other Europeans were wounded. " The insurgents called on the people to take up arms in defence of their faith, but, fortunately, the appeal was made in vain." On the 6th of July the Bishop and his flock were obliged to quit the neighbourhood of Patna, and go to " Bankipore" (probably Bhoglipoor is meant), as great numbers of deserters came down the Ganges in boats fromn Dinapoor. "We arrived at Bankipore on the 11th of July. Fourteen of the insurgents have been hanged and 16 condemned to hard labour in chains." Although the foregoing intelligence is but meagre, it is of some importance, as it shows that the Bahar district is in a very disturbed sta,te. It has been satisfactorily explained why forces have been concentrated in the south-western part of Russian Poland. The Emperor Alexander will review the troops as he passes through NVarsaw on his way t0 Germany, and cavalry detachments have been sent to the spot nearest to the Austrian frontier which His Majesty will have to cross on his way to Berlin, by railroad. The German papers still continue to assert that General Ismael Sappa Tappa, the Tunisian Envoy, endeavoured to obtaia from Count Buol a promise to interfere on behalf of his master the Bey, who is just now subjected to great pressure by tbe Freich IUovernment; but such was not the case The Tunisian General spoke in general terms, and merely expressed a wish that the friendly relations between Austria and Tunis might be maintained. The Oesterreichtsche Correspond'en, a day or. two. since, informed us that the Austrian flotilla of screwsteamers was about to leave Leghorn for Tunis, but the news that a French squadron has gone there is likely to lead to a change in the plans of the Austrians. The Emperor left Kaschau yesterday morning, and will be back in his castle of Laxenburg at a late hour to-morrow evening. Durinig his short absence His Majesty has twice given audiences to the Primate of Hungary and to several of the bishops and magnates, but no opportunity was afforded them of presenting a petition. It is related that the venerable Archbishop of Gran (the Primate) was but coldly received, and it is not inmprobable that such was the case. No guarantee can be given for the correctness of the news, but the Roman Catholics in the Archiepiscopal See of Gran are said to pray in the Litany that His Majesty may be pleased to make some political concessions to the faithful Hungarian nation, Duringhislassvisitto HIungary HisMajesty Y occived some very pretty presents from the various deputations which waited on him. Neusohl,a mining town, presented a chisel, hammer, and mallet of silver; the manufactory of glass at Hermanetz gave a beautiful vase, and a paper-mill at the same place a splendid albumu. Losoncz showed its loyalty by offering for the Emperor's acceptance two large cups of the finest flint glass; the one was ornamented with the enamelled portraits of their Majesties, and the other with the bust of the Emperor in bas-relief. The cover of the Ctup last mentioned represents the crown of St. Stephen. The free city of Bosinig gave a barrel of essence (Ansbruch) wiae, and a barrel of table wiue; the free city of Modera half a barrel of wine of the year 1830 (the year of the Emperor's birth); aiLd the free city of St. George half a barrel of the Ausbruch made in the neighboursood, which is not much inferior to the Imperial Tokay. The community of Bur St George gave a piece of home-spon linen. No ac. count has beeu given of the recent festivities in honour of the Emperor, because they were exactly like those which took place in Hungary three montbs ago. IIis lajesty and his subjects are probably equally tirf;d of such a IODg series of officia fetes and rejoicings. it is at length definitively settled that a starsp of one kreutzer shall be impesed on each copy of the non-official Austrian papers. When you learn thlat a copy of the -largesh. Alastrian new'i.p,ez at present costs but 2 kreutz-4k, (not quite ld. English) you wi bl aNe. to conceive what a heavy blow las been dealt to the press. The Government wvishes to diminish the tlmulber of readers of low degree, and its ain will b~ attained. The Ost-DeuWsche Post of this moraing asys Its circle of readers will bo decimated, but It will probably find that it has deceived itself The paper in question, which now codts 11. 4i per an. nuim, will, from the lit January, cost 11. ]6s., a price which is too high for at least one-fourth of lIt subscribers. The general impression is that the Finance Department did not propose to impose a atamp duty on the press but that the measure was taken at the instigation of the Archbishop of Vienna and of Baron Bach, the Minister of the Interior. Their partisans aver that such was not the case, but their asertions obtain no credit witli the public. According to some of the leadera of the finance-world, the Bank will negotiate a loan of 150,000,000fl. at the beginning of the year 1858. The securitywill be State domains valued at 155,0O0,000fl, andtheinterest6percent: that is, 5 per cent. will be paid to the subscribers ini hard cash, and I per cent. will go to a lottery which will be drawn once a year. If the foregoing terms are made, there will be little difficulty in raising the money required, for the Austrians are extremely fond of so-called "lottery loais." A correspondent of the Auvsburg Gazette writes from Bologna that the Austrian corps of occupation in the Legations will soon be greatly reduced, as the Papal Govern4 ment ceases to pay the monthly subsidy of 54,000 zwanzigers (1,8001.) On the 28th of Augast a part of the garrison of Ancona began its march towards Austria. hI future the gmrion of Ancona will have but one Austrian batallion, that of Bologna, tbree battalions of the line, one squadron of Hussars, and 12 guns. Each of the battalions of the line left at Bologna wil undergo a redaction of 120 men. 'The "supreme comnand" (ober-commanno) of the 8th corps of the second army, which is now at Bologna, will be removed to Padua. An Austrian soldier on duty at Ancona desired a person in plain clothes to take a cigar which he was smoking out of his mouth. The smoker, who was a lieutenant in the Papal army, placed himself in front of the sentry and began to lecture him for his impertinence; but the Austrian cut the matter short by knocking the cigar out of his self-appointed tutor's mouth. A complaint was made by the lieutenant to the colonel of the regiment, but no satisfaction could be obtained, as the soldier had only obeyed the orders which had been given him. By the foregoing it is to be seen that the Austrians are more absolute abroad than they aro at home, for no objection is here made to a man's smoking his pipe or cigar as he passes a sentinel. Vienna is at present crowded with foreigners, and it pains me much to say that the persons who speak least favourably of Austria are the Germans. If Austrian statesmen could have foreseen the effect which the Concordat would produce on the German Governments, they would probably have quitted offico rather than agree to it. The northern and southern Germans vie with each other in abusing Austria,but the latter (the Roman Catholics) are, if possible, more violent than their Protestant brethern. Daring this summer 180,000 persons have made a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Virgin at Mariazell. By the Constantinople mail of the 29th of August we learn that the Shah has placed his Mahomedan, Christian, and Jewish subjects an a footing of perfect equality. Persons of either religion will in future be permitted to serve the State. Herat is not yet evacuated. 50,000 men are assembled in Khorassan. Mr. Murray was received by the Shah at his summer residence in the mountains. The Emperor reached Miskolez, on his way back from Kasehau, at 11 yesterday morning. Lieutenant CoTo-netCoantSzirmxy, -who o-ma nicc the Imperial carriage al the way on horseback, fell dead from his saddle when the Emperor stopped to receive the congratulations of the burgomaster of Miskolcz. PRUSSIA. (mom OU OWuN oo:0asroNDWqL) BERLIN, S=r. 5. This place exhibits just now a very unwonted degree of excitement for this time of the year, arising from two different causes of two very different natures. Next week is to witness the opening of the conferences or meetings of Evangelical Chris. tians from al countries, at the invitation of the Berlin Committee of the Evangelical Alliance; and also the grand manceuvres of the 4th Arm6e Corps, to be held not far off, in the province of Saxony. The effect of the preparations for this latter is to give this city for the moment a most warlike appearance-that is to say, as far as the appearance produced by double the usual number of soldiers in the streets, regiments marching, and bands playing here and there, can be called warlike. Thes manoeuvres are to commence on Monday next, and will comprise all the evolations of an army in the presence of an enemy; they will, as perfectly as possible exhibit a " mimicry of noble war," and doubtless, as far as the precision of the movements and the mart appearance of the troops go, there will be nothingleft to be desired. On this occasion the manceuvres will be attended by the King, accom. panied by the Queen and the variou*Royal Princes, and also by the King and Queen of Saxony, together with all the Princes of the various Saxou lines, as one of the solemnities to be observed on this occasion is to be the re-inauguration of a mediaeval church on the Petersburg, near Halle, in which the bones of the original progenitors of the Saxon Kings and Princes still lie. This churob, vwhicli has for centuries lain in ruins, has lately been restored in its primeval style by the King of Prussia, who will also, on the 8th inst., inaugurate it again. The other event, which is exciting attention and is introducing some animation into the non-military circles of the population, is the approaching attempt on the part of the Evangelical Alliance to bring together Christians of aU denominations from different parts of the world to express their feelings of fraternal Clhistian charity in the stronghold of Lutheran exclusiveness and bureaucratic control. The visitors from other countries have- as yet arrived in but spare numbers, as the first meeting is not to take place until Thursday next, but the local committee seems not only to have woke up itself, but also to be awakening others to a percep.tion of the coming fact. At a sitting of this local committee last Thursday evening it was annoumced, that the municipal authorities had voted a contribution of 1,500 thalers towards the expenses necessarily to be incurred for the purposes of the conferences; on the other hand, private subscriptions; have produced 1,158 thalers, an amount wbichi though small as it is in reality, is neverthelwss large considering the luke-warmness of the majesity ,and the hostility of an indefatigable clique. The Princess of Prussia has also just lately sent inx 15 ducats towards the. expenses, while tha Kixig. has contributed 200 Friedrichs d'or (17C ii.) to the same fund, with an intimation that, should the pecuniary contributions be found 'mn the end to fall short, he would be re ady to send in a further subs.cription. At the same meeting a translation was read by or e of the King's Adjutants of the English address, delivered a few montlhs back to the King at Po4 ,sdam, by a deputation of the English branch of cbe Evangelical AUiance, sonme passages of wvhi' h had been greedily seized ou here, and misrepr esented to the public st laage as containing attaclk.su, ou parties and per. sons-in tk'e Church here, statements wlch wefe totally unfosiuded. These circumstances h?iwinB baen brought to the King's knowledge, he ham ordered the address to be translated and published, to the tonfnsion of the opponents of the Evangelical Alliance. The opposition and hostility to this laudable exhibition of Christian charity contemplated by the EvangelicalAlliance have called forth not onlya well merited reproof from the General Superintendent (Bihop) of Brandenburg, Hoffman, Dut also a very distinct intimation of the King's feelings and intentions on this subject at the hands of the Ober-Kirchenrathi or Suprer&6 Consistory, by his command That the contents of this circular to all the General Superintendents of the kingdom, and through them to the inferior clergy, might not be confined solely to the knowledge of elerical circles, the Preusaisc7e Correpmode has been instructed to inform its readers that:- "It is with anxiety and indignation that the King hu heard of the restless endeavours being made by certain elergymen and theologians to deter people from attending the meetings about to ba held here by the Evangelical Alliance with his perriison and approbation. His Majesty had therefore com. nded the Ober-Kirchenrath to make known to all general superintandents his determination not to allow silenoo on his part to be mnisrpresented as consent (to this oppositional movement), but that he was resolved to lo,ve no opening for doubt on this point-viz., that he attached the most lively interest to this esembly, In which he hailed and welcomed a manifestatlon of Christian fraternal spirit as yet unexamnpled, ana of the Providence that presides ove, the destinies- of the Evangelical faith. While far from desiring to impose on xsy 9ne an attendance at ths n meet. ings, the' King will as little conoeal from evrey one how much importance he attaches to them, and whak auspicious results for the future of the Church he expects from them." The various members of the Ober-Kirchenrath are retutning one by one from their pleasant travels to thia (particularly just now) most unpleasant town, for t'he purpose of being present at the approaching meetings. It has, however, been resolved, at a sitting held a day or two back, that they shall, in conformity with the whole spirit of the movement, attend solely as private individuals aud not in their official character. As the most prominent and zealous of the opponents of the Evangelical Alliance are just now, in commou with everybody else not under the strong influence of duty obligat ons, absent from this city, it may be confidently expected that they will select the most agreeable method of showing their disapprobation of the meetings by simply staying away from them at a distance from the heat, dust, and stinks of Berlin. WIPRTEMBERG. A private letter from Stuttgard, the capital of Wurtemberg, dated the 2d inst., gives the foilowing details respecting the preparations wbich are being made at that capital for the expected visit of the Emperors Alexander and Napoleon:- "For the last fortnight a number of artists and workmen bave been employed in embellishing and restoring the apart. ments of the Royal Palace in our capitaL These sumptuous preparations, which are unusual here, might astonish people who know the tastes and habits of our Monarch; but It soon transpired that during the month of September the King expects some foreign Sovereigns on a visit, who will remain a week at Stuttgard. Among these Sovereigns i; may now be affirmed are the Emperors Alexauder and Napoleon. Stuttgard is, therefore, definitively the spot selocted for this long spoken of interview. Our King is expectcd back here every day from Biarrltz, and great preparations are also being made in the summer palace and in the palace of the Crown Prince for the reception of the 4alnstrious gpests." SWITZERLAND. Letters from Berne, of the 3d inst., inform us that the Council of State of the Canton de Vaud has commanded a levy of troops to prevent the exeewtTo fmthe wmhethe metion oft le Oron Rtllway, between Lausanne and Oron, the Federal Council having annulled the interdiction pronounced by the cantonal Council of State against the continuation of these works. The following few words will explain the conflict which has so unfortunately arisen between the authorities of the Canton de Vaud and the Federal Council at Berne. A federal resolution, passed on the 23d September, 1836, granted the concession of the railway from Lausanne to Oron, and among the principal conditions of that concession figured those which authorized the Federal Council- to approve the line and plans on the territory of Vaud, and to apply there the law of expropriation. On the 9th March lasit two orders were published by the Council-one for the expropriation of the ground, and another declaring that the commencement of the works is of urgent necessity. The Council of State of Vaud, having been informed of these orders by a special message, immediately forbide the communal authorities to publish the plans of expropriation, alleging that it had had no commiunication of these plans, Some days passed, but the Federal Council insisting, the works were begun in defiance of the Vaudois, and the railway company assembled 80 labourers at Lavaux. Thereupon the Coancil of Vaud held a meeting, and on the 28th August last it published a decree, commanding that the works should be iir mediately suspended in the districts of Oron and Lavaux, the definitive plans not having, it said, been submitted to its approval, so that it had been unable to take any decision on the subject of the line. This decree stated, moreover, that, accord. ing to the second paragraph of the eighth article of the conditions of the contract the Company had agreed to submit plans and estimates to the Council of Vaud, with a detailed account of the vorks. This rtsistance produced, on the 2d inst., a meeting of the Federal Council. After a long sitting, it resolved to annul the interdiction of the Council of Vaud, wbich was allowed until the 15th of September to examine and approve the definitive plans. This resolution has been sent to Vaud, with an invitation to the Council "to abstain from violent measures tending to maintain the interdiction of the 28th of August." The Vaudois have, however, paid no respect to this invitation or injunction. It is to be hoped, for the peace of the Confederacy, that they will not persevere in their resolution to disperse by force the labourers at work on the railUway, and that before the arrival of troops at Lavaux snd Oron the difficulty wil have been got over in some amicable way.

IPRANOE. (3'OY OUR O0W CORREQNDFrT.) PAR"S, SATURDAY, Ssrr. 5. The reports of serious disturbances in Syria and of the disorganized state of that important province of the Turkish empire which have been current in Paris for some days past are fully confirmed by the following letter received from Beyrout, dated the 16th of August : " Our merchants are in a staie of great unesainess, and If order be not restored ia the country all transactions with the interior wiJ become impossible. The mail whicb left this on the 10th inst. for- Damascus wax plundered at a distance of six leagues from Beyrout by the Druses, and two of the guards were severely wounded. Cash to the amount of 182,000 piastres was carried off by the highwaymen. Of this money 100,000 piastres belonged to the local Government, and the remainder to private persona. The Emir of the Drses has written to the Defterdar here to say thal he took this money to indemnify himself for the rmars of pay due to him for severalyears. Thelocalauthorities, in placefo punishiug the malefactors, are Imposing fresh taxes On the peopio to replace the money stolen. News of a still more dissetrous nature has been received here. It Ls said that the great caravan which left Damascus for Bagdad two months sinee bas been completely plundered by the Bedouins of the tribo of Chammar. This carava,; composed of 1,250 camels, carried merchandise worth 15,000,000 pimtre The drivers in want of water turned from the direct road to reach a branch of the Tigris or Euphrates, and while in the Desert the caravan was attacked and pilaged. This news has caused great anxiety among the merchants here, who still hope that it will not be confirmed." The Councils-General of Departments have closed their session. The Councils of the Bouches-du- hone, the IfNievre, Somne, Seine et Marne, BassesPyrenees, Loire, and Dordogne, have passed reolutions in favour of M. LeIsepe' plan for cutting through the Isthmus of Suez. The Council of the Oiso has demanded a branch railway from the Dieppo line to the towns of Meru and Chaumont. The Council of the Loire Inferieure has demanded a railway from Nantes to Laval, through Chateaubriand, and another from Nantes to Niort and IAmoges. The Council-General of the Nord has unanimously voted the following resolution:- " Protection is, and will be for a long time, the most imperious want of French agrierltture and manufactures."

ATLANTrC TELEGRAPH CABLE. TO TEIE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-If hollow watertight globes or spheres were attached to the cable as it ran out, there need not be so much weight on tho breaks, and, of course, there would be less strain on the cable itself, and the danger of Its being again broken be much, if not entirely, removed. For example, let one of these globes of, say, about 27 inches diameter, be hitched on at every quarter of a mile* to the cable as it runs out, each would possess a buoyanoy in round numbers, after allowing for its own weight, of 3 cwt If the cable weigh a ton per mile, then three-fifths of its weight would be relieved. It may bo relieved more or less than this by enlarging or lessening the size of the globes, or by placing them nerer or further apart, so as to suit every emergency. The globes may be made and shipped in halves to save stowage. They may be of very thin copper or zino plate, not more than Soz. or 10oz. to the superficial foot, having a light iron flat ring, by w2y of flange, to each, so that they may be quickly fixed together byscrew bolts. In one of the flanges there should be a small groove, carrying a ring of galvanized indiarubber to make the joint. These globes could bh attached by a suitable cord, or, better, with a " cock-eye," to the cable after it has passed all the sheaves. If the cable were running out at the rate of si miles an hour, then a man could touch it with both his hands, a it passes him for full two-thirds of a second-an ample time with properly-contrived apparatusandtbe necesaryscaffolding. He would bave to attach every minute and a-half. 'The cost of the globes would be more than compensated for by the saving in stray cable. I remain, Sir, your most obedient servant. IL 0. LACY. Richmond, Sept. 5. * 22 Inch globes every furlong would relieve about the same weight.
INCOMES OF THE CLERGY IS TICTRIIA. TO THE EDITOR OF TIlE TIDIES. Sir,-In the article which appears in The Tines of to-day on the maintenLnce of clergvmen and churches bv vo'utary contributions there are two erroneous statements, which I ask permissiox to correct, as they may prove inurxious to the intere.ts of the church in the colony cf Victona and to some religious societies in England. 1. Adverting to the Bishop of Melboa's istler, which appeared in Ti.e Times of yesterday, yeitattnrbRe 4c tohe Bishop the assertion, that the incomes s£ the clergy iu the colony of Victoria co:ne entirely from the vossntary giEts of thtir congregations. Bui the Btsho'ks lettar contains no such statement, and nothing from vich sush a&n iference can be drawvn. 2. Further on in the same articlxi yee. say taat in this colony "the clergy of our churob are th7own entirely upon the voluntary principle." This satemr2nt, also, is incorrect. First, the Colonial Lgislatar, in 1S53 voted * 0,0001. p1r annum for the maistenare of religion in ViCtoria, rather more than half ovw;hini snm was applicable to church of England purpo&se (Your own newspapeir not many days ago, announced Vioa;iproachiDg discoutinuantce of this State aid ) And, saoudly, various societies in England-of which the Soc4.ev for the Propagation of the Gospel and the Celon;.al bhurch and School Society, are particularly named-r/,>nrtbute annually towards the matntenance of clergymer, in Victoria. These Phcts are reoorded in a atescncof t',e Proprcas of the Churdz, &e., by the Bishop of lelbo csue, published by the Societa for Prom otlng Chnistia, Knowsledge.

She also brought telegraphic advices from New York to the 27th vid lialifax. The Canada experienced fine weather, and has made the pawe in a trifle under ton days. The screw steanisp City of Wmahington, hence, and the steamer North Star, from Southampton, arrived at New York on the 24th ult and the Anglo-Saxon, hence, at Quebec on the 23d. The Washington correspondent of the New York Herald considers it extremely doubtful whether the fMilitay expedition to Utah would be despatched before next spring, in oonsequence of the disorganization of the fo,rce. The Surrogate had given a decision in the Burdell came. Mrs. Cunningham, in hiB opinon, is not the -widow of the murdered dentist, and he had directed the issue of letters of administration to the next of kin. MrB. Cunningham, according to the statement of an inquisitive reporter who visited her in her cell, maintained great coolneu. She was of opinion that the Surrogate, though an upright man, had been influenced by her enemies. The Hon. R. K. Meade, the lUnited States' Minister to Brazil, was about to leave Wahington for his post. He is said to have received instructions to negotiate a new commercial treaty, and to endeavour to obtain a reduction in the Brazilian tariff. A murder had aken place in a diDing aloon at New York. Nymus, an actor, met an attorney namedWVagstaff, and, some altercation ensuing, the latter struck the former a severe blow. Nymus immedintely drew a revolver and fired two shots into Wagstaff, who immediately fell to the floor a corpse. According to the Yew York Times the potato crop in the States was fearfully diseased. Tidings of the submarine cable expedition were eagerly looked for, and, as the Yweather had been favourable, sanguine hopes wfere entertained of itsauccess. At Portland a salte of 100gns was to be fired on the receipt of the wihed-for inteligence. The suspension of Brewster and Co., bankers, is reported in a telegraphic despatch from Rochester. At Boston the firm of Whitney and Hinds had failed. The reported failure of Blanchard, Sherman, and Co., at the same place, is contradicted. A telegraph message from New York to a Boston paper mentions some additional fail.res. It says:- I The suspension of the Ohio Life and TruEst Company bas been folowed to-day by that of Jobn Thompson, who has for so many years done the leading business in uncurrent money, and acted as agent of various banks. Thia suspension has been whoUy unexpected, and will cause an inconvenience, the extent of which cannot now be estimated. The assets of 31r. Thompson are largely in banknotes, not avallable at present, and in other securities aike of small value in ths present excited state of the market.

TEZE UNITED iSTATE& (FRIOM OUR OWN CORFESPONIJT.) NEW YORK, AUo. 26. As the summer draws to a close, and the cool evenings warn us that the open air is filled with autumn chills and aguea, the political heavens begin to show signs of preparation for struggle in the coming Congress. The Administration are SUi O of a nominal majority there. But the Democratic party cannot count upon that strength. The same rock upon which the Whig party split to pieces in 1852 is still there, more dangerous than ever. Four times has the Slavery question been settled for ever, four times have the rejoicing cannon proclaimed the death of the monster, and four times has it arisen from its ahes. The Kansas BiU was to settle everything, and yet the State of Kansas itself threatens to give more trouble to the Administration of Mr. Buchanan than Central America and China combined. The South are all grusubling at his policy, grumbling at the speeches of Mr.Walker promising fair play to the Free State party, grumbling because there is a prospect thatalas is to be a Free State, with Free State Senators in Congress. This sentiment finds expression everywhere, nowhere more strongly than in Virginia, a Slave State, with Slave State sympathies and Free State aspirationg. Perhaps there is no State in the Union in which the question of labour has taken stronger hold. In the great planting States of the South slavery is, and, in spite of Exeter-hall, will be profitable; and while profitable it must be the only system of labour on which the world can rely for the produotion of cotton. But Virginia is midway between the labour of the North and that of the South, and feels the political struggle all the more keenly for that reason. Its pride and Its historical associations and traditionary position are with the South, while its like those of Missouri, are gradually pointing towa the North. The discussions during the Presidential election were very bitter in that State. From the tone of the journals I judge that the bitterness has by no means subsided. One class of the politician are disposed to make common cause with other Southern States in hostility to the Administration for permitting a course of policy that may result in making Kansas free. Others go with Mr. Buchanan, and openly advocate making it free, if the fair popular vote declares that way. At the North the same struggle is going on, with the sides and odds reversed. The great pary that presented so undivided a front to Mr. Buchanan last autumn is divided now. The party watchword is hoWtility to his Kansas policy-a policy that has, they say, rewarded the principal " border ruffians" with offices, and is about to make ans a Slave State. It is not to be concealed-the Republican leaders do not themselves affect to ignore it-that the party do not follow the lead blindly in this direction They are disposed to await the developement of Mr. Buchanan's polBcy, and the end of the KEnsas drama. There are signs of doubt of the result even in Masachusetts and New York, each of which States was carried for the Opposition by overwhelming majorities at the Presidential election. Mr. Speaker Banks is the candidate in the former State, the gentleman under whoe lead the Republicau party was consolidated in the last Congress, and was enabled to offer the efficient opposition which it did. I can scarcely persuade mysef that the result can be doubtful m either of these States, but the fact that it is at all questioned shows the revul,sion in the poplas feeling. "Tho truth is there ir, no real is,ue pencling on the great question of American politics. The fate of Kansas, which was the great isue of last year, is already decided, and the mass of people both North and South are too busy about other matters tothink much of politics. Yet the movements to which I have called attention are worthy of notice, as straws showing which way the political winds are blowing, and as indicating the oppotition which the Administration is to meet in the coming Congress. The election in Missouri is yet undecided. The vote ls very close ; each party claims a majority of tens in a vote of many thouannds; and there ia no probability that it will be determined before the official count. Whichever way the result mav be, the real victory will be with the Anti-Slavery party In a Slave State-t-oly two years, ince the most objectionable Slave `tF to Fee State men whose border ruffians," as; st dyled, had almost made a Slave $3tate of Kaiza1 the popular vote is so nearly in favour of emancipation candidates that the result can only be determined by the official count. Trhis ir,reallya victory, althoughitmay be nominallya defeat. Yet it is not to be looked upon as, a declaration in favour of abolition or interference with slave property. Probably there is no State in the union where much property would be more jealously guarded than in Missouri. It is only a declaration in favour of free labour in a State not adapted by soil or climate to the growth of cotton, and whose great rivers and woncderful nmineral wealth point towards commerce, manufactures, and maming as the sources of its future prosperity. Neither of these can be profitably pursued wish slave labour. In the United States the slave question, except with a few visionary persons, is emphatically a question of political power. AB an economical question it takes care of itself, and as a moral question the Constitution has wisely left it to the determination of the community in which it exists. Brigham Young, we are told, meditates resistance to the Federal authorites. Brigham is in his way an autocrat on a grand scale; not only are the lives and fortimes of his subjects in his hands, not only does he claim the right to "unsear' their wives and " seal" them to himself (and exercise the right which he claims), but he also claims and exercises the right of thinking for them on all subjects. The constitution of the United States guarantees the Republican form of Government to all the States composing the Federation. The Dred Scottdecision having removed from Congrecsthe power of regulating the domestic concerns of the territorles, the right can only be exercised now under this provision ; and, whatever may be thought of Renublics in Europe, on this side of the Atatic a State with an infallible, irresponsible theocratic head is not a Re- public according to the popular notion. Pablio opinion will therefore support Preddent Buchanan in whatever measures he determines to adopt, The season is now so far advanced, and has been so cold, with such prospect of early frost and snows, that I doubt whether it will be deemed advisable to press on for Utah before next year. This is to be regretted, as the blow could probably be better struck this year than next year.

THB PERSIAN EXPEDITION. (FROM OUB OWN cOBREZSPO.rDM.) BUt3HUX-E, JUNZ 28. Sir James Outram and Staff reaohed Bushire on the 12th from Bagdad, and on the 14th Sheilk Mohsin EKhan, Sirhang, deputed to vist him by the Serkeseekhby Bashi, waited on our General at the Residency. The day follow. irg the Envoy was received with due honours at the camp, where he was introduced by Sir James to Brigadier-General JTaob, who succeeds him in commandof the Persian expeditionary force. The greatest cordiality existed between all parties, and subsequently a return visit to the Peian camp at Borazgaun was despatched by Genczal Jacob, consisting of Lieutenant-Colonel Trevelyan, of the Bombay Artiuey, and two or three other offioers All was quiet at Moham. merah; no Perdan forces had returned to that place, which was stiUl held by the Chaah Chief on behalf of the Shah, The Hon. Company's sloop ETalkland was anchored abrcast the northern fort, but the Clive had moved lower down the river for achange of air. The crew of the latter vesel had suffered severely from fever, while that of the former were compara. tively healthy. This is attributable rather to the wretched accommodation for the seamen on board the Clive tbhn to any other apparent cause. The man of the Falkland were in the habit of landing every day, and eemed to be on the best terms with the Arabs. Sir James was ordered to India Immediately, owing to the disturbed state of the Bengal Presidency, and was further directed to deaptch s many troops a- possible to Bombay; General Jacob was also directed to proceed to India without delay; but Sir James argued iustly, that while our forco remained on the Persan soil a commander of General Jacob's renown and ability waa absolutdy requisite for the full effliciency and morak of the continued oocupa. tion. The Poonah Horse, however, were sDared, and despatched to Bombay yesterday. The force now left at Buahire is as follows;- Cavalry AAMery, 4,~~~~~02 NativIr e.. ... ... ... ... 1,20 ersA RNU^tti°vPeaa ,76 Infantry. . . 3,739 Sappers ... . 214 :5,431, with 12 field-battery guns. The troops, with t1e exception of the Artilery abovenamed, are all natives It is currently reported that great sickness prevalls among the Petsian troops at Borawgaun, and that the Commandear in-Chief is anxious to break up his camp there. Several regi. ments are urgently required to enforce the Payment of Government tribute in the direction of Beibahan, where the people are said to have refused and resiated all demando made upon them by the Shah. Rumour has it that the Persians are playing us false as regards Herat, and that the commander of tha; place wiU refuse to evacuate It, even if ortlered to d. so by the Shah. At present there seems no foundation whatever for the report, and so far the Perdans have mted in good faith in fulfilling the treaty. There is no knowing, however, how the mutinies In Bengal may affect the Couirt of Teheran, and to what extent extraneous influences um' be plied to prevent the desired consummation. A. serious question then arises-TlzL, how far It is desirable to maL-jtain so large a force at Bushire when its services may h imperatively required in India Should Perdsia officially refse to evacuate Herat, it would be undoubtedly less de. sirable to remove the force than before the announcement of suoh a bieach of the treaty. But by remainixg at Buagire that force, without strong reinforoements (not likel- nor, to be a-,alable for a long time), could do rothirbv ' its present position. Yet that position, a far as ± ecoaV be maintained without the force, which, i neee * -. be despatched for service i Indi. at once. K±a i be retained by a regiment and u or t7ru m aided by b.war stea"me or . , -.ad the laVer might effectually blockade Buahire and provent the occapatie;r of the town by u Persian army. Mohsmmerah, in like marn uer. might be given up, and the cruisers there be remove I for service at Karrack. Unles I vatly mistake the signs of the timeg, a pretty quarrelis brewing betweent beOput and Persians anent the boundary qnetion; at If evaets -1is not likely that the former wllalow the Persians to re erect the fortresses upon the Shatt-ool-Arab which have been demolished by us. Their ereetion under any circum stances was in violation of the treaty between the two countries, and their existenoe might have cut ofi at ay -oment the Turkish trade on the river from the Gulf to Basorah. Moreover, by all accounts the Persian army in Arabistan Is said to be so utterly disorganized, and the State finances at so low an ebb, as to render it moraly certain tnat the Persians cannot re-esAblish themselves in force there for some time to oome, What I would ansel, therefore, under present circumstances, should HEtat not be surrendered, is this,-remove our forces from Bijahre to India; garison Karrack, blocoade Bushire and the neigh. bouring forts, and keep the Persians from occupying the former place, should they attempt it, by occasional shot and shell from the blockadginjuadron. This course, while it will render available for India the British force now in Persia, will be a sufficient threat and punishment to the Shah until we are able to take more effectual measures for the chastisement of such a breach of the treaty. Of conrse, our bope is that Persla wlll se it to be her interest to render unecessary any such hostile proceedings on our part, in which case we hope to hear that the announcement of the evacuation of Berat will be made to lr. Murray on his arrival at Teheran, looked for about the 1st of August, In 15 days the news of the same could be transmitted to Bushire, so that on the 15th of August the whole British force may evacuate Persia KURRACHEE, SCINDE, JIULvY 13 The Berenice arrived here on the 2d inst. with the Persianste prisoners, the ex-Governor of Bushire, the Derlah Beg, and their suites, who pToceed this ovening to Bushire in the steamer Lady Canning.

Tim TmxGXArH TO IxD&..-This subject hb not been lost sight of by the Government. Many months before the first tidings of the recent disaters in India arrived in England arrangements had been entered into and negotitions commenced with the voew of eompleting a perfect system of telegraphs betwoen England and India. And be! fore we prooeed to consider whrt the publio interegt now further requires in this direotion, it maybe as Well that we should state what has already been done, and what is in progress. The lAst acounts from India were received by telegraph from Cagliwa a small town at the southern extremity of the Island of Sardin*a, nearly an entire week before they reached us through Trieste or Marseilles. Wore than two years ago the enterprising Government of Sardinia established this submarine telegraph from Spezzia to Corsica, and thence to Sardinia- thus openiog a direct communication from Ca4gi with England through France. This was ro far in a direct line to Malta. The English Government, therefore, some months a entered into a contract with the Mediterranean Puectrio Telegraph Company to oonstruet a line from Cagliari to Mata, and thenoe to Corfu. These two lines will be laid down in the course of next iconth, and thus in a few weeks we shall recelve the Indian news immediately upen its arrival at Milta. This wil at least be one point gained. At the same time that this arrangement waa made the Government received overtures from the Government of Austria for the latter to construct a line from Ragusa, on the shoreg of the Adriatic, to Alexandria, paSSing through Corfu, the effect of which would be to oomplete the entire line through Malta and Corha to Alexandria. This arrangement with the Austrian Government is, we understand, upon the point of being eoncluded, and It is expected that early in the spring the line will be id. Thus by these arrangements, made some months ago, there is every probability that early in the next year we shall have a telegraphic communioaion perfected from London to Alexandria; which wrill bring Bombay within 15 days of England. In six weeks our oommunication with Malta will be completed, and in dxmonthswith Alexandris. It remains to complete it to Kurrachee, and the Government has show every desre to aid those who are prepared to embark in that undertJldn,-zc4minfr.

It appears that notwithstanding all the stringent means adopted to keep their body united, the numbers of the "Sainb" are continuallythinningbydewrtion; andnowonder, for here is a& sufficient cause :-The account Bays, "That which produces the most ill feeling is Brigham (the Mormon King) 'eallng' young girlatoold.men," frequently in violation of the laws of consanguinity.

But wherever they come from it is quite clear that their fate is the most cruel and degradig that coarse-minded and vulgar men can ign them, for. the Mormons at home and in private do not even cloak their bestiality with the mantle of religion. I see it stated that "Young inl secret coucil sits with a crown Upon his head, as representing God'svice-regent upon earth." This fellow is a vulgar vrufawho can't speak decent English ! In mercantile business there has been a decided improvement in the demand for goods for the interior during the past fortnight, and sales to a considerable amount have taken place, although the rates obtained have not been very remunerative to shippers. Oing to the lorses sustatned by former speculations, and to the distrust engendered by the recent failures of several of the jobbing houses, and to the spicions entertained of the other jobbers engaged in the intermediate business between the merchants and the retail dealers, the credit stem is becoming much curtailed. It was a great mistake to introduce the credit jsytem in this communitic where operators of all classes commence busmne3s wthout capital, htere speculation is so ife, and there the facilities for fraudulent babruptcy are so great, owing to the state of the insolven^ lav ding ismuch to gie aidea thsate o r ,e=ciknt C oi_i combine to conduct business hence ftonarn don a cash basis.

Large importations ofpraw sugasn from Chinad Manitrc siam, Calcutta, and Batavia have materially injured the market, and about 600,0001b. have been run off at auction at a decline of about 2c. per lb. on former rate Parcels of China brought (muo.1) from $11 sdc. to $11 12ic. per l00lb.; Suum, 1th c. to anci per lb.; MaccilIa, wfhite clayed, for refining, 9ic. per lb.; Batavla, No. 14, at 11 kc. per lb. In refined sugar transactions have been limited to a fe s parcels, which brought l7ic. per lb. Tea.-The late advices from China have had the effect of advanclng the price, but most of the article li still held in a few hands for a further rise. The sales of foreign wnes and brandies will soon be affected by the domestic production. The southern districts of California produce grapes of superior quality in great abundance, and the manufacture of wine has been undertaken on a considerable scale. The quality is pronounced so good that it mus soon supersede to a considerable degree the sale anud use of foreign wrines. Brandy has also been distilled of late, and it is said to equal in flavour the best brands of the French liquor. Indeed, it is remarkable the number of articles mnufactured alreadyfin so newra countryaudwthere labouriasao high. Sugar refining, whisky and lusnudy distilling, oil refining, rope making,basket makig, all the preparations of timber for all sorts of usles by steam machinery, the conversion of iron to all the purposes of the steam engine, shipbuilding, ale and porter brewing, and wine makdng, are some of the " industries" which occur to one on the spur of the moment that have been established in California within the last three years, excepting iron foundries and shipbuilding, which date a couple of years earlier. I would mention as a matter of import&ace to mariners that Captain Krabb, of the Bremen bark Creole, which arrived in San Francisco on the 9th of this month,, reports the discovery by him of a cluster of rocks in the North Pacific not laid down on any chart. Here ix his memorandum of the fact - "Per Creole.-On the pasge from Calontta to San Francisco, on the 7th of June, in the North Pacific, fell in with custer of rocks not laid down on any chart, although we had the latest. In the middle they Are only a few feet above water, and at each end rose a sharp rock about 50 feet. The sea was breaking on them very high. B7 good o("tTAtons and good chronometer we made them m lat. 3156 N., loDg. 139 56 B. On the same afternoon psed an isand laid down on the chart as doubtfuL Its position on the chart is nearly correct by our calculation, although We were too far off to ascertin po&itively." The work of harvesting is nearly finished throughout the State. It now appears that the crop of wheat, barley, and oats is abundant. Vegetables mever fail in our prolific soil, and I take les. account of them as they are not articles of export. The extraordinary increase in the growth of fruit is a most remarkable proof of the good quality of our soil, pad of the g&pt- ability of the climate to the production of peaches, aprioots, plums, cherriTe, and strawberries i or years after my arrival in altfornia thee fruits 'Were unattainable. The firAt fresh apples came from Oregon, and sold at a dollar eaoh. In the mines, as late as 1854 I saw them sold at $2 each apple. Now the market of San Frandcso exhibits as fine a collection of as good frait as can be produced anywhere, and in a short time a large trade in dried fruits must spring up to take off the surplus quantity 'hich cannot be consumed in the country. These are not the only changes of a progremive character that one observes in this ' fast" country. California, which a few years ago imported everything required to sustain life, is now becoming an I exporting eantry. The prospects of this vwimng trade are so well set forth in one of t-ho local newspapers that I am tempted to quote frorc it. The export of flonr and grain, which assumed some importance in the years '55-56, has been resumed this year on a large scale only with respectto barley ; but it ha tecome evident that all the grains, in addition to hidsg, wool, skins, Ac., will hereafter become staple articles of export:- "We understand that at, the current zates ckarged for freght a husbel of grain can be sent from San Francisco to New York as cheap as it can from Chiego to New York. From the fact that oar seasn is much earlier than it is at the east our produce by cUppers can be placed i n the New York market as early, if not earlier tbhn that from Wisconsin, Iona, and other wesrn States, while an regards quality it has the preferenoe. Besides, the California farmer can uocemfuyll compete with t!e farmers of those States, for, although the expense of labour here may ba greater, the increased yield per acre is more than commensUrate with the incresed oost of production. On an avarage, more than twice as much baQe can be raised on an acre her as in the eat. If the agrliutural resomce of this peat State are deTeloped as they should *and can profitably be, the time is not far distant when most of the ships arriving here from Boston and New York wll go back freighted& with that which, after all, is of mnore'ralue to a Sbta than gold, -viz., the products ot our fertile valleys ard the industry of the hardJ yeomsury of the land." From the sampleg of the new crop brought to market the quality is pronounoed good. For barley the demand is active and the supply abundant. A sale of 2,000 sacks was made the other day for export to Chili. This fact would appear tarvellous a short time back, for Chfiis mnost prolific in barley, and we do not hear of a failure in her own crop. She has an unlimited extent of rich soil and abundance of labour at about a 15th the price of labour in California, yet we send her barley and flour. The solution is that the great prosperity of Chili has increased her consumption. She has exported to Australia, and the freight from San Francico to i her northern ports is lower than sipping can be ot at inValparaiso. Owingtotheadvices just receive at San Francisco from Australia of the scarcity of oats an active demand has set in to execute orders. The price at which oats were purchased yesterday was 2c,, which has nowv advanced to 2ic. the lb. Money-Market.-The receipts of golddust have been about the same as last month, and would have been more had notthe Mint suspended hork for ome time back, as is the annual custom at this period. Its operations will be resumed in the early part of next month, and no doubt a good deal of gold now held back will be sent down for refining and to be run into bars, being the ishpe in which it is now saleable. The news from the mines continues satisfactory. Extensive preparations are being made to work in the river bottoms so soon as the water reaches its lowest stage. This plan of mining is the most productive when suce , as there is a larger accumulation of gold in the river bottoms than in the Placer Diggings. One hears the most conflicting reports on the subject of money at present. A dozen men oomplain of its scarcity and of the tightness of the money-nmrket, which disables speculators and jobbers of aU sorts from doing any business, whfile a far less numerous set complain that money Is accumuIating in their hands, and that they cannot make a living out of their interest. These two claes represent, of course, the lenders and the borrowers The simple faet is that money is very abundant. The place is glutted with it, but its use and circulation are very limited, because the borrowers have no security to offer. Interest is 11 to 24 per cent. per month, according to the value of the security. Good weurity would command any amount at the lower rate. Mexican doLlars are very scarce, and in great demand for China. SmaU lots bring 134 and 14 per cent. premium. Chinamen engaged in businem are always prepared to buy up all they can obtain. Gold bars of 880-1,000 fineness are at par. Bars of this finenes leave in iNjw York a proft%of i per cent. Exchange.-Banker' selUng rates, 47,d. for 60 days' sight bills on England. Outside bills can be obtained at I to 2 per cent. more favourably to the buyer-say, 60 days' at 48d. and 481d. The duty on the stamps now required to be ued on all bills made payable beyond the limits of theState amounts to about 1-5 per cent. (or 1-5 of 1 per cent., as it is called in our legal phraaeology)-rather aheavy tax. In politics the two parties into which the State Is divided, the Democratic and Republican, are engaaed canvassing for State officers. The only fact of any interest abroad which has occurred in the canvas is a resolution adopted by the Democratic Convention at the capital advocating the payment of the State debt. The Democrats are supposed to have a majority, and if they make non-repudiation a party "issue," it may succeed. Unles some special influence can be brought to bear upon the electors, however, I fully believe that a majority will vote for repudiation. The miners hold the decision in their hands, and as yet advocate non-payment of a debt which they affect to say was incurred for the benefit of money-sharks and uzurera, foreign and domestic. Several " difficulties " resultin in death by violence have lately taken place in San Francisco and other Darts of the country; but none of them were of such a romantic nature as to make it worth while giving details. These deaths are the result of the most trifling offences suddenly given and instantly avenged on the spot. The cowardly and unnecessary habit of wearing pistols and knives causes infinite bloodshed. The practice is common among the class of " fat men," and its consequences so frequent that people become callous to these sad events. The juries view them with great leniency, and the cowardly ruffian who shoots or stabs his antagonist even when all the odds are against the latter is complacently said to have " got into trouble," and gets off scot-free on some absurd legal plea or quibble; or the jury can't agree.

The following statement is condensed froIn the Frceman' s Journal of this day.- " There are few to whom the benevolent exertions of Mr. Vere Foster, our coumn aen notA kowm . 8m.n time ago Air. Fo stcrdoll in outh, Meath, an the neighbouring counties a nunber of y girls of nspotted reptation, to the number of 120, wit the ijew of pzo vi ing for them in the Western States Of Americ-. Ha,ing shipged them at Liverpool on board the packet ship Cit of MoD Us, andnmde all the necsay arrangements for their safe conduct, ma he imagied, Mr. Foster preceded them by; steam to New York, both to receive them on their arrivl and conduct them to their future secttement. The City ofl Mobile duly arrived, but for some reasn or other Mr. Foaster found a general reluctanoe on the pert a. h prol6 togo, further. Ultimtel_y not more than a dozen out of the 0 consented to leave Ne w York, with whom he went we6tward and placed tbem in good situatlons. What became Of the 100 who left their homes under suchpromising Auspies, and whose chiracter were so pure before the pollntion of the emigrant ship ? Nothing was known of the poor creatures-how they lived or died-until some time after, when a kind-heLrted gentleman was struck with the appearance of a wretched object in the most fashionable thoroughfare of New York 8 he as an Lish girl-one who had suffered and was suffering much in mind and in body. Her face was oovered with brais and her body with rag Sbe told a wild and pitiful stor to the commisioners of emlgratlcn-that she came to New York in the City of Mobile under the care of a gentleman whom she afterwards requited with ingratitude-that she had since lived a life of crime and suffering, and was now a wanderer in a stran land without a home, friends, or money Suan Smith the Broadway outcast, was one of the girls who went n;a under Mr. Foster's care, and had been seduoed from the ship by. ilors and others to houes of i-fame, where their rum was accomplsbed. The wretched girl was too weak at the time to mako a full statement, but subsequently she deposed to the folowing facts, of whisk there is no doubt, and which unfold another chapter in the diabolical history of Liverpool emigration -Her affidavit Is to the effect that, alter thc vesel had West anchor in the port, five of the female psezngers were on the same niht taken on shore by a boat's crew of the ship; next mornng five others were taken off by 'the quartermaster ;' at noon the same day the deponent and another girl were taken away to a brothel, where they remained for six weeks; that the other women were taken to Castle Garden, the regular point of disembercation at New York, and landed. The is little room, however, to doubt that all or the majority were subjected to the same profligate influences and onquences. Here is a wbole cago of virtue-before it was subjected to the contamination of sailors-lost for the want of ordinary care We never heard or read of such a sad story. Out of 120 who left Irelad In sfety, with their characters vouched by their clergy, only 12 or so were uninfected, the resthaviugbeen ruined in the ahortspeoeof one month. We presume tho friends and relatives of the sad freight per ship Mobile are already In p on of ths facts to which we bave adverted; If not, they may discover in the subjoined deposition of poor Susan Smith food for tears andlmentation.

A Supplement to the Fort St. George Gazette of the 17th July publishes the following address to Lord Harris, Governor of Fort St. George, from the Hindoo and Mahomedan inhabitants of 31adras. Some hundred signatures are affixed to it:- " To the Right Honourable Lord Harris, Governor of Fort Saint George. "My Lord,-We, the Hfidoo and Mahomedan inhabitants of Madras, beg to address your Lordship in Council at the present critical juncture of affairs in Bengal and the North West, where the Bengal Army has added to the guilt of matiny and rebellion the unprovoked and indiscriminate murder of many of their officers, and, still worse, of a great number of defenceless Euxropean women and chUdren ; we want words strong enough to convey the feelings which are inspired by the frightful atrocities that have been committed. Their orimes admit of no palliation, misguided though they may have been through the secret mis. representations of evil-minded men; but we have the fullest confidence that the alarm occasioned among the Bengal soldiery by the introduction of the new cartridges originated solely in a deludon so far as the intentions of Government are concerned, and that neither an infringement of the laws of caste, nor an outrage to religious feelings, had ever for one moment been contemplated; and we earnestly trust that the might of the British Government wil be put forth, until all who either actively took part in or abetted the unheard-of barbariiies of the revolted troops have been subjected to the condign punishment of the State. " While we thus assure your Lordship in Council of our loyalty towards, and deep sympathy with, the British Government, and with the relatives and friends of all who have fallen victims to those bloodthirsty and misguided men, we would crave leave to congratulate your Lordship on the unshaken fidelity of the army of Madras and the perfect tranquillity that reigns throughout this Presidency. We rejoice to think,also,that the same state of affairs exists in the neighbouring Presidency of Bombay. " In conclusion, we beg to express our entire conviction that the overthrow of the British power in India would be the greatest calamity that oould fail upon the natives, and while we regard with pride the loyal services of the various native princes and chiefs in alliance with the British Government, and the alacrity with -which they have assisted to crush rebellion, we beg to assure your Lordship in Council that you may unhesitatingly rely on the allegiance of the natives of this Presidency, and we shall make it oar special business to spread the knowledge of this declaration of our sentiments as widely as possible, and to discourage to the best of our ability all the groundless and mischievous rumours which from time to timegain currency,either through the fears of timid and ignorant individuals or the malicious designs of wicked men, who makeit their object to go about and to seek means to propagate discontent and strife. "We beg leave to subscribe ourselves, my Lord, " Your Lordship's most obedient humble servants, "Madras, July 2, 1857." SEKLKOTE. The following is an extract of a letter from Dr. J. H. Butler, 9th Light Cavalry, dated Fort at Sealkote, 13th of July:- " From my last letter you wil be but little prepared to hear of an outbreak at Sealkote. We had hoped that all was right with our brigade. But, alas I on the night of the 8th of July they laid their plins to rise in mutiny oh the followiug morning, 9th. At a quarter past 4 a.m. I was called up to see the Sowars, who were in open mutiny, riding about the cantonments shooting all they could of the male sex having an European garb. No intimation from any of the authorities was given us, but we had previously arranged (we were living with another party, Mr. and hrs. Sanders) to have our carriages in readiness in case of an outbreak, and a few things in carpetbags to take with us; this was all done, and we were about to start when Dr. Graham, the superintendent-surgeon, who had gone before with his daughter, was shot at and died almost immediately on his dauighter's knee, the buggy was turned round and she came into our compound enclosure, s3ying the cavalry troopers had possession of the roads, and there was no possibility of getting towards the fort. This would not have been the case had the civil horse not fratermized with the cavalry, for they looked on and did nothing, Almost immediately a cavalry rooper, with his carbine pointed, cause into the compound L .d cleared it of our servants and carriages, and brought up the Sepoys of the 46th N. L to surround the house and massacre us. We were now a party of 16, 14 Europeans and two natives (female servants). We bolted and barred the doors, and silently awaited the approach of the murderers. Of the 14 Europeans three only were men, all congregated in the drawing-room, wience the ladies retreated to the bathing-rooms, and then into a small lumber room (in a private part of the house, to which is attached a side door); in this room there were fortunately two small windows, one open, and in the door some grating, which afforded ventiation. " The party of Sepoys brought to the house by the sound of the bugle were now within the house, and had foUowed us to the bathing room, but at seeing my pistol presented retreated. This enabled us to make good our retreat to the lumber rooms, into which we got, and fastened the door with a strong bar of wood. No sooner had we done this than one of the villains came and fired into the room * he was fired at by one of the party, but missed; they then began t) plunder after firing promiscuously into every room they o Lme to, with the hope of killing every one in the house. We were for nearly six hours kept in a terrible state of sus. pense and alarm, expecting every moment would be our last. At 11 a. m. the chowkerdar, or watchman, came and brought us some water, and said our only security was in keeping quiet, that the house was being plundered. The yells were frightful. We heard the Sowars from time to time riding about the compound anxious to get hold of us, but the chowkerdar told them we were gone. " When the mutineers blew up the magazine we thought they were blowing up the side of our hiding-place, to induce us to come out to massacre us. One thief tried to break in our door, and looked in at the grating; I took a steady aim and shot him dead; this saved us from further molestation from the plunderers, deterring others from approaching our hiding-place. The watchman came again at 2 o'clock, and told us the troops were going away, sad that in the evening it would be safe to make our way to the fort, a distance of a mile and a quarter. We were reported killed, and received the hearty congratolations of our friends. At one time, thinking there was no hope, we made over our youngest boy, an infant at the breast, to the native rnurse, and she promised to screen him. She took him out under the charge of the watohman, but was unable to leave the compound till we ourselves left. She did not come to the fort that night, but I sent for her the next day, and she brought our babe to us in safety. We are anxiously looking for assistance from home. Publio news you will see in the papers. We have been plundered of everything; property of every description lost-houses, carriages, furniture, and wearing apparel." LAHORE. The following is written by an officer of the "Mean Meer, Lahore, July 14. "I returned to our lines yesterday, being relieved by the left wing of the 1st BombayFusileers,upwards of 300strong, so we now have a large European force here. The Fusileers camne up from Kurrachee in steamers to Mooltan, and then marched on here. We sent two guns and 50 of the 81st to the tridge of boats in the Ravee, at Labor., to intercept the Sealkote mutineers in case they zhould come that way. The l'Sth Native Infantry, after murderiDg all the Europeans at the place they were stationed, marched into Delhi witb the band at their bead playing 'Cheer, boys, cheer.' The heat of this place for the last few days has been fearful-the thermnometer upwards of 100 in the house. I am obliged continually to put my head in a basin of water to cool it. AMany officers with their families, from Sealkote, are expected at Lahore daily. The number of ladies, women, and cbildren that are here already is immense; they all flock to Labore as the only safe place, and now we ehall hhortly have the fugitives from Jhelum. We have just sen; 100 men of the 81st to reinforce the garrison at UIm. 3itdr." JUBBUILPOPE. The following we some intereating extracts, of letters from Jubbuipore, the last rather of a cheering nature:- "Jubbulpore, June 19. "News from India mAst be anxiously looked for by all, but more especilly by old Indians. All the troops in the Saugor division have remained stanch after a fashion. We, thank God, are all well and safe as yet, and I conceive the crisis here Is past. I scarcely know how to begiu to tell you about our alternate hopes and fears. One day finds us all hope and comparative security, another that our lives are not worth an hour's purchase; and yet, somehow, I have never given up hope of our safety, except on one occasion, when the danger of a mutiny was moat imminent. On this day, Friday week, the men by a stupid story were made to beliove that the European troops rere within a mile or two of the cantonment, and cominig on at double march to punish and disarm them. This immeditely threw the whole regiment into commotion, and, when the bugle at noon sounded for the men to go and cook, the Grenadier6 and first company refused to leave the lines, and it was with difficulty they were prevented seizing their arms. The good men of the regiment interposed and prevented them going to the bells of arms. The Subadar Major, a man of great influence with the men, ran to tho colonel's to report what was going on, and suggested that two or three men from each company should be allowed leave to scour the country and satisfy themselves that no force was approaching. The colonel consented, and some men started at once. All reasoning was thrown away upon the men; nothing would convince them that there was no force coming. Since the scouts returned reporting no troops were coming we have had comparative quiet, but these men are such children in their ideas that we cannot calculate what an hour may bring forth. This mutiny, for it can be called by no other term, was the more to be xegretted, as the men that saine day had shown a good spirit under circumstances which might, if mutinous intentions existed, at once have brought things to a crisis. The adjutant was inspecting the men for duty; a man he had passed a paco or two suddenly rushed upon him with the cry of 'Death to the Feringhees,' and accompanied his cry with a downwards thrust of his bayonet. The bayonet passed down tho sloeve of the adjutant's jacket, and grazed his arm and side. A sudden turn forced the bayonet from the musket, and ths old Subadar Major tried to seize the Sepoy, but was thrown down; the man, however, was soon captured, though he laid about him with the butt end of his musket like a fiend. He has been twice treated for madness, so, if not mad, it is politic to say he was so on this occasion. He has been sent off to Benares under an escort. The man ssaid he expected to have been backed by others who had put him up to act as he did. I suppose his expected backers saw they would meet with no sympathy, and were not sufficiently numerous of themselves to get up a mutiny. There are a great number of good men in this 52d Regiment, and we must hope that they have sufficient interest to keep the bad men in order. As a number of ladies and children have left the station I have been repeatedly urged by folks at Bamptee to send Mrs. -and the little ones there; bat the wife has de'termined to remain to the last. Once I said she must go; but wi en I found she was more likely to die if she went than if shi, stayed, I changed my mind, and now, from the state of affairs at Kamptee, I really think we are as safe here as we should be there, We have Eent some things and a tent out on the road to Seonee, so that we may not be quite destitute if we contrive to escape. On Sanday we heard of the march of a force from Kamptee to Seonee. This had to be told at once to the Sepoys here, for they had said they would murder us all if any Europeans were sent here, Again the men were told they might send some of their number to see that the force had no intention of moving beyond Seonee. Good heavens, that it should have come to sech a playing at soldiers as this I But what can we do but temporize? We are entrely at the mercy of a powerful body of armed men. No place of refuge or rendezvous to fly to in case of revolt; each must seek safety as best he may, The only arrangement we can come to is that all have agreed to take the same road. Some ladies never take off their clothes at night, and all are prepared for immediate flight. Our carriage is drawn up at the door every night, and the horses kept harnessed; but for all that we go to oed as in the most peaceful times, and sleep soundly. It is no blind confidence that enables us to do so. I think it is quite bad enough to be killed without fretting one-. ,elf to death beforehand. I keep 10 or 12 of our servants sleeping near the carziage, and make one of them act as sentry while the others sleep .in Peace. I get up occasdouaUc ,Aee at my. Nezsta is on the alort. This is the more necessary now as Dr. W.'s house had a narrow escape of being set on fire four nights ago by some villains from the bazar. We have now a chain of chowkedars alU round the cantonment." "Jubbulpore, July 2. "I am sorry to say I cannot give you a bit more satis. factory account of our condition here than I gave you in my last. For a few days we had almost laid aside our fears, but only to make us again feel more keenly our help. less and precarious situation. I have still strong hopes that no outbreak Vil take place here. The Sepoys are much in the same state; the native officers and good men do all in their power to restrain the evil-minded, and aU apparently goes on smoothly. But what reliance now can be placed in any corps ! One day it is a devoted and faithful regiment, the next it is in open mutiny, initiating its revolt bya series of atrocities and murders. The dreadful crimes committed cause the blood to curdle with horror at one moment, aud at another to boil with indignation and a thirst for ven. geance. The newspapers wil give you more than enGngh of details of children ripped untimely from their mother's womab; and helpless innocents crawling from their burning home only to be hurled by remorseless villains back into the blazing pile. Let me return to our own doings. We had believed that if the troops at Saugor remained firm we had little to fear here. A short time ago a detachment of 500 Sepoys and two guns marched to queU a disturbance in the Chundery district, on the way to Sullutpore. They attacked and captured a small fort, taking 16 prisoner. The bad men of the detachment insisted on the prisoners being released, and released they were. On this news reaching Saugor the Brigadier determined on occupying the fort. He ordered general parade and guard mounting, and when the guards were well scattered to their posts, the guns were moved off to the fort covered by the irregular cavalrythe cavalry placing all their valuables, more than 10,000 rupees, in the fort under guard of the European artillery men. The infantry by this move seemed cowed, and were regularly checkmated. The Brigadier assem bled the active officers and told them that after what had taken place he had no further confidence in the infautry, and could not have any unless the bad men were given up. After a deal of talk this was agreed to, and our news this morning is that 100 of the best men of the two regiments with two native officers have marched to try and persuade the good men of the field detachment to join them in seizing the ba d ones. It remains to be seen whether the good men will obtain the ascendancy. I fear the thing will resolve itself into a regular rise at Saugor , if it does we shaU be in a bad way here. You may fancy our anxiety to know how the affairwviU terminate. All quiet at Indore and Mhow on the 27th. Yesterday accounts came from Nagode that 60 prisoners had broke gaol in the middle of the day; they at once rushed towards the officers' bungalows, intending to fire them, but the Sepoys and police turned out and shot down 14 of them, capturing the rest, except eight who contrived to escape. Of these only one is of any consequence. Vell done the 50th. It is said to be one of the finest regiments in Bengal, but even though they have now acted thus to-morrow they may be in mutiny." " Jubbulpore, July 20, from our intrenchments. "I find I have half an hour left and seize it to tel you that we are still in the land of the living, and not only that but well and wonderfully hearty. My last letter told you of the officers and ladies going into the fort of Saugor. On the morning of the 4th inst. Maior JE- came to me and said he had just received a crumpled penoil note from N-at Dumoh, saying that he and the two officers in oharge of the detachment of tho 42d, and a lady, the wife of one of them, had been obliged to fly for their lives; that a number of the irregular mutinous cavalry had galloped over from Saugor to plunder the treasury, which contained a lao aud a quarter of rupees. It was feared these troopers would come on here and try to get the 52d to join them, so it became -a question what was to be done with the ladies and children. In the first place it was resolved to send them off to Nursingpore, and an express was sent off to order some of the Madras Sepoys and a couple of guns to the Nerbudda at Jhansi Ghaut. In the course of the forenoon it rained heavily, and we all knew how impracticable the roads would be after it. So it was determined that we should sll,regimental officers also, take up our abode in the Residency, Major B -'s houEe, which I and others declared we could fortify so as to resist any attack of mere musketry. Accordingly, in the evening we aU moved into the Residency. We were obliged to show confidence in the 52d, even to the extent of having a guard of them near the house, and they were informed that we had merely moved into the Residency as a precautionary measure against the Bundelas, who were up and plundering. It was too late tha tevening to do anything in the way of defence, and few of us dared to hope that night would pass without an outbreak. Thankful, oh I how thankful, were we all to see the dawn of another day. Posts were assigned to all. I was appointed Garrison Engineer, with two artillery offeers here on the staff'to assist me, We set to witb a will, and on he evening cf the second day we felt tha' we could hold our own iolong a artilarywas not broughtagainatus We have been graduallr.trengtheningourposUtion, replacg our hriedlyconstmucted works by defenoes of a more permanent nature. We have six months' provisions stored, and hope to get water inside in the course of a day or two. What we have now to gurd against is a surprise, but we do our best to prevent that. All of us, except the commissioner and two others, take our turn of entry duty-two of us on santry at a time. We have a number of non-commissioned snd uncovenanted, who also furnih a couple of sentries. I have been on duty avery night except cne. We muster abcut r0 at dinner, 10 of whom are ladies, and we have 15 children in the house. Our numbers are nearly 100, inclulding the uncovenanted, We have included some spacious outhouses in our intrenhoments, which gives them accommodation. We are luckY i ihaving a sm room to ourselvas. In one room three ladies and a child sleep in one bed. If you could look in upon us you would not think we were a very lugubrious set, but rather tbat we were met on some festive occasion. At this moment I hear the Piano and singing. We me a queer lot, we Britons; day after day we hear of atrocities too horrid to write about, and of the murder of friends and relatives, and never seem to think of oar own fate. laughing, talking, eating, drinkiEg, muinc, aingingall seems to go on much as usuaL For a day or two we really had a cloud over us when we heard of the death of Sir Hen-y Iawrence-the uncertain fate, too, of Cawnpore is disheartening. To return to our neighbourhood, the Subadar fajor of the 42d, left with the companies at Dunoh, wrote in to say that he had removed the treasr into the fort and that he would protec't it for Government. A few days after some villains belonging to the Shaghur Rajah came down, but a, aAvildar went into the village after them and killed 11, drving the rest off Things at Saugor after the move into the fort went on quietly for a few days. At last the s1i nd irregular cavalry quarrelled, and the 42d who had zed the morning gun joined the cavalry and fired round shot Into, the lines of the 31st. The 31st replied with musketry and the 42d took it up. They fought at intervals for a day and a night, and at iss the 3st gaiiantly charged and -captured the gun, driving the 42d out of the canton. ment. The offieors of the 31st wished to join their men, but as treachery was feared they were not allowed to do se The 3Mst immediately sent the gEn into the fort and next day prsued the 42d, but could not overtake tbem. When the news of this fight rsached the detachment in the field, the whole of the 42d men and some 30 of the 31st quietly bolted, taldng with them their arms. The 31st returned to Saugor, bringing back the two guns and delivering them up, Three companics with their officers were then allowed to go to Damoh with Captain P-, deputy commissioner, and this morning re have news of the arrival of the detach. ment at Dumoh, and peaceable delivery of the treasure. It is sid the two companies at Dumoh of the 42d were the greatest rascals in the corps, and the old Subadar an old scamp. However, I sappose he will be rewarded, for we must now judge him byW acts The Nagpore authorities would do nothing for us. An order was sent by the Governor-General to send a moveable column into the Sangor territory, sso now wve have the dras 33d, a squadron of the 4th Cav,alv,nd the horse battery of the irregular force manned by our European artillermen, all under Colonel llUer.

Luckily therewero two gums nearer the house, and these being manned a regular cannonade conunenced, under cover of which the ladies were placed in vans, and then the party retired with their gans under a heavy fire, but too nigh. Not a soul was injured, and after many hardships they arrived at Hoshungabad. The Sehore folks had to foUow, and then the Augur people, 27 in all, came in. Mrs. W - writes that all the ladies were almost destitute of clothing, and she has given all hers away, so that she has scarcely a change left. The W - house is full of fugitives. One lady of the Augur party had a baby a week old, and another had a baby only a fortnight old. These poor ladies had frequently to wade up to their waists in water. "Some of the mutineers of the 42d joined some of the Shaghur folks and looted a village; they quarrelled about the plunder, and some Shaghur people were killcd. The Bajah seized the men of the 42d, stripped them, and turned them adrifli. The villagers did the rest-they killed all they could lay their hands on. uiurah !
MASSAC OF MISSIONARIES AT CAWNPORP.! TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.

They, too, have perished in the in-discriminate slaughter of thefr-ftunkytmen-and. countrywomeAn You wil1 not fall to observe in the letter a passage which seems to add to the evidence that the recent deplorable mutiny in India is not so much the work of the Hlndoo as of the relentless and fanatical Mahommedan. should this prove to be the case the Government will, it is to be hoped, know how to distinguish the conspirator from his dupe. Many members of the society win see Dr. Kay's letter for the first time in your columns. I have at this semon no opportunity of laying it before them in a formal way, but an already recorded resolution warrants me in saying that this second heavy blow, instead of disheartening the society, wiU have the effect of animating it to more and more zealous and sustained exertions for the furtherance of the Gospel and all Its healing influences in a land s o long sunk in superstition, and now so deeply polluted by lood.

MArL&BD(1touG11.3TP=X.-A half-bllind votung Swiss presented himself to Mr. BAD)ON to thAan him for the ssistance be had given him a few days ago. This yonng 11an was found by a sergeant of the polioe wandering About the streets In a state of bewilderment and destitution, and as the readiest means of getting at his story tho Fergeant brought him to. Mr. Albert, the interpreter of this court, wbo, having questioned him, immediately brought him before Mr. Beadon, who elicited these facts. The young foreigner's name is Jacques Winckler, of Zurich. le arrived in thix country about a fortnigbt ae0 with the view of giving public specimens cf his caloulatii2g powers. Ie had rnetwith a person who indud him to beKe he could help him to car out his views. Thu peron robbed him of all is propert-hislittle etc of lothes nd money and, wbat was of more consequenoe, of a packet of letters of introduction to persons of scientific emineno here, the sAIdresses on which he retained no recollec'ion of. Being utterlywithoutmeastopro abed, heehadwanderedabout the streets at night for miore than a week, and must have perished from actual want, because unable to make his condition properly known, had be not met with the police sergeant. The young foreigner proposed to give immediate proof of his povver. Sums of multiplication-8, 10, 12 figure, by 4, 6, and 8 figures-were calcalted mentally with unfailing accuracy Cnbe roots, slx places of whole numbers, and as many paces of fractions, were extracted with facility, and such appeared to be his astonishing power of mental calculation and mnemonic tenacity, that wherever a donbt about the oorrectnem of any solution was hinted he instantly repeated the whole series of figures and went over the calcalation again. Mr Beadon, hvLg satisfied himself that the powers possessed by the young man were of no common order, directed 5s. to be given him from the poor-box for his present necessities. On Saturday the young man stated he had not been able to discover the directions on any of the personS to whom he had received letters of Lntroduction. His hopes, therefore, of interesting SOme influential person to patronize him so far as to enable him to ve public specimens of his powers, or to attend at some institution to display his faoulty of mental calculation, were completely blighted. In the course of conversation the young foreigner id he became blind some years ago from over-study, and while blind he cultivated his calculating powers to their present extent. He bad now, however, very imperfectly recovered hisvlslon. His chief inducement for coming to England was the kind notice which had been taken of his case and powers by Mr. Charles Dickens in the Household Words. Mfr. BW)AoN gave the young foreigner 6s. mor and advised him to make application to the directors of the Polytechnic, or some other popular and scientific institution. WESraxsT -John Gorman, a prisoner in the Penitentiary, was charged with cutting and wounding Southani Beddington, one of the warders. Itappeared that Beddington was conveying the accused and two other prisoners along a passage leading to the dormitory, wben he was struck by the accused on the right cheek with a sharp instrument. The blood flowed and he staggered and fel down. The prisoner ran off to his own celL The instrument with which he inflicted the wound was a piece of n >teel stays busk, sharpened at the end and stuck into a piece of wood, The warder was very seriously injured, and had been for ten days in a most precarous state. While being examined the prisoner behaved in a most violent manner. He was committed to Newgate for trial. Wo0R_siP-wrR?TJ.-M*ria Clark, a middle-aged woman of unprepossessing appearance, was charged on suspicion of wilfully causing the death of her daughter, a girlof eight years of age, vnd ws oommitted tiUl Saturday next. THAMEs.-Captain Johnson William Doyle, the master of the ship John Sugars, appeared before Mr. 8ELFt, on hail, to answer a charge of cruelty alleged to have been practised by hin towards Robert Esstick, a boy aged 15 years, an PMprenticed to Mr. John Sugars, of Lynn, the owner of the ship whichbears hi name, ona voyage begweej liartlepool and Ceylon. X. bodkin, the barrister, instructed by Mr. Pollard, of the Treasury Solicito's office, conducted the prosecution; and MIr. Lawrence, the barrister, defended the accued. Prince Montague, a man of colour, who gave evidence on Tuesday, was recaled, and again deposed to Captain Doyle repeatedly flogging the deceased boy with a rope, kicking him, striking him with a rope on the bare head, and other gets of violence. The boy was also compelled to march up and down the deck with a handspike over his shoulder lI -e a soldier. He had heard the boy say he would throw himself overboard, and that he was tired of his life. Mr. Bod3 inparticularly questioned the witness as to what occurred when the boy tbrew himself into the sea, and he stated that the weather was good. When he came out of the galley, on hearing thecry of "A boy overboard," the captain was on the poop. He saw no efforts made by the captain and mates to save the boy. In cross-examination by Mr. Lawrence, the witness said, -The captain complained of my inattention. He complained of mo at Cylon. He stopped part of my wages, and I was forced to go te Lawyer and sue for my wages. I obtained aU my wages by order of a magistrate of this court. On the day the boywas drowned the captain beat him, because apiece of cheesewas lost. When the boy went overboard the chief mate had the life buoy i his hand, but did not use it. The helm was put down by a black man, and not by the captain. He was sure no rope was thrown over to save the boy. He was quite sure the boy was struck on the bare head with a rope. Mr. Bodkin.-How long was the boy compeled to walk the deck with a handspike9 Witnessm-From 8 to 10 o'clock at night. John Stowe, a man of colour, said he jonled the John Sugars as auable seamanatHartlepoolin May, 1S56.. He had seen Eastick repeatedly ill-used by the captain, who was not particular how he rU-used him, He had eeenuthe captain flog the boy all over his body two or threo times a-week, and sometimes snore frequently. He had seen the boy marching up and down the deck with a han.spike over his shoulder, sometimes for two hours, and on other occasions for four hours. Mr. Bodkin.-Did the boy complain he had not enough food!? Witness.-The boy complained of being starved. I have eeen the men give him victuals. I have given him some of my own. The captain beat the boy severely the day he was drowned, and on the day before that event took place. The captain flogged the boy because he did not scrub tho companion ladder. The boy was thin-featured. At 10 o'clock on the day the boy was drowned tho captain was flogging him with a rope's end, and the mate said, "I wish the -- would kUll him, and he would he hanged at onoo." The boy was singing out to the man at the wheel, '- George, come and take meawayfrom him; the master is killing me." In the afternoon he saw a mark on the boy's arm where he bad been kicked. I told the hey the captain would kIll him outright, if he did not look out. At 4 o'clock, a quarter of an hour after that, the boy was overboard. It was fine weather. Wben the cry was raised of a boy overboard the captain said "What boy 1" and took up a life buoy. No rope was thrown out to him. Mr. Fletcher, a solicitor, said there were no lines to the life buoy. In crois-examination by Mr. Lawrence, the witness said that 11. 13s. was stopped by the captain for inattention. He never saw a boy punished by being marched up and down the deck with a handspik-e on his shoulder except on board the John Sugars. The captain did not take the helm vhen the boy went overboard. Tho boat was hauled up, and laFhed and crossl-ashed. Mr. Bodkin.-However the boat wa fastened no attempt was made to lower it. Mr. Lawrence,-It could not be lowered in time to save the boy, who disappeared immediately. Stowe, in continuation, said the captain told Eastick he would make him rne the day he ever came on board the John Sogars. That was said a month or six weeks after leaving Iiartepool. Robert Way, carpenter of th3 John SSugars, sid he had twPice seen the captan illuso the deceased boy Eastick, one with his hasds and another time with his foot. The boy did nothing to call for this, The lad wFas about 15, and made proportionately for his age. There was a mark on the boy's arm asi donef y aseaboot, It was a very large bruise, as if done by the sole of a boot, Ea bad seen the boy marching ep and down the deck with a handspiL-e on his shoulder like a soldier with his musket. Witness was in his berth tick when the boy committed suicide. Mr. Bodkin.-Vhat did the boy say when he showed you his arm? Witness.-He 'said, " Carpenter, don't you think it is too bad? I would sooner die and put an end to my exis- tence than be used in this manner every day." The boy has come to me and asked for food. LUross-examined by Mr. Lawrence.-Tbe captain never complained of me at aU, but he wanted to cbarge for money I never recelved. He stopped sugar and other things, and the magistrate here ordered us compentation. I did say wben we were at sea that 2s. 6d. per day ought to he allowed us instead of 4d. per day for short provisions. Tlree men were put into prison at Colonnbo. Mr. SnLFE'-How many persons were there on board? Witness,-Tbere were 17 on board in all. Mr. Bodldn then applied for an adjournment, and the further Investiaetion waa postponed until Saturday next, the captain being liberated on his own recognizance in the suUI of 200s and one surety (Mir.

MILTTIA EXPZNSMS TO T-E EDITOR OF THE TDUES. Sir,-Permit me, through the medium of yoar oolamnnp, tonov. an erroneus isupresslos. whicbh may be conveyed by the letter of " A Militia Captain," to which you have given insertion, with reference to the expenses to which an officer is neoessarily put on joining. First, he aest the uniform at 751. I served 18 monthswith an embodied regiment, and I flatr myself appeared on pde as wel dressed as any other officer ; but my whole paraphernaliacloak, tunic, bluo frock, shell jacket, four pairs of trowsers, chako, forage cap, sword, and sash-only cost me aboat 391. Next, barraok furniture he Bet at 501. Yow, if a man will give from 171. to 221. for a showy bed and hangings, and other things in like proportion, this gwn may be easily spent, but ir is not necessary. For myself, I took a common iron bedstead, which cost me about II.; my bedding, &ac, including chintz covers for the bolster, pillow, and bed, which gave the whole a neat, sofa-life appearance by day, cost me about 61. A set of comteon damask curtains, a mahogany washstand, with folding top, and buffet press of deal, nide to my own design by a carpenter, completed my necesry furnitare, which, *ith tub, watercan, and toilet service of blue ware, cost meabout 81. more, making about 131, against the 50o, which " A Militia Captain' sets dowvn as the necessary cost, and with this by day my hut was as neat a little drawing-room as one need bave. Then, as to mess expenses, the Militia Captain does not say a word of the very liberal allowance for establishing the mess made by Government on the embodying of each regiment, nor of the sabsequent annual allowance of 25C1 per company, nor of the weekly allowance for rent of mess-room and kitchen, as also that for fuel for both while the regiments are at their own head-quarters previous to bdng sent Into barracks or camp. Ie also entirely forgets to givo credit for his own lodging and fuel money and camp allowance. Again, be sets down 60 days' pay as contribution to the mess fund, and 30 days' for the band fond. If he will refer to the Queen's Regulations, pages 129 and 139, he will find these are 30 and 20 days respectively, exclusive of eight and 12 days' annual subscription, which cannot be exceeded, bat may be reduced by the commanding officer. The wine allowance he also forgets to mention. Besides all this, he seems totally to forget that he must live sorewhere; and where can he live where ha has not rent, coals and candles, the wear and tear of plate, linen, china, glass, cutlery, &c., to meet, all of whicb are covered by these charges and allowances while with his regiment ?-while the saving in plain clothes must also be set against his uniform ? On the whole, these freqnent outcries against the expenses of militia regiments are exaggerated when they are set forth as necessary. In fact, in tho regiment in whfoh I served dumrng the last embodiment I knew an ensign who actually didcover all expenses save that of his first oatfit by his pay. I also knew another who ex. pended near 1004 in baiTack furniture and decorating his room, and who boasted of living economiically if he brought his expenses within 200.Z per annum beyond his pay. These are, of course, extreme cases, but I do assert that the expenses of any officer below the rank of a field-officer may be brought very easily within 501. per annum, in addition to his pay. That the expeases of most regiments were very heavy. and heavier far than they need have been, I do not dispute; but a referenoe to Thc Timejs of June 12, 1854, will give a good hint to officers oommanding regiments and mess consmittees as to what with good arrangement may be done even under the moot expensive circumstances-namely, that of esablishing a mess at am hotel. A letter from an otficer of the Royal South Middlesex there sbows the expenses of the officers' mess of that regiment at the George Hotel, at Eounslow, at that time. They were these:- Brekfat, with oold meatt eggd 1 Dinner-2 9 Lunaheon-1 6 Officers only paid for their dinners when they dined, and were required to put down their names in tUe morning. No charge was made for the mesa-room. By their own arrngements their sherry and claret (after deducting the wine allowance, of course) only stood them in half-a-crown a bottle, on which they paid Is. corkage to the landlord. It woald, doubtlems, be a great advantage to young oOicert if some such fixed scale was laid down by authority, and I see no reason vby hotelkeepers should not be bound to supply a good plain dinner to the officers' mess whero regiment3 are in billets at some suoh fair charges. If they were exempted in such cases from having any men billeted on them during the time the officers' mess was held in their house, this, and the advantage of the extras - s;ch as brandy, soda-water, and cigars, which would be taken by such as choae it and oould afford it-would induce hotelkeepera to compete for the erivilege of having the mess ieshbltshed at thtir houses, iastead of, as now, comnbining together, not only in each town, but throughout the kinedom, to levy upon the officers the most extortionate cbarges tbey can obtain.

COLLEGE FELLOWSDIPS TO THE EDITORt OF THE TMSEB. SSr,-As I am paticularly lnteseted in the Eubject of Fellowships, which you so ably disemwsd in your leader of yesterday, perhaps yon wil pdttuit cie, for the good of ta' public, to mention some of the %bvses of the present Fel'.ow. ship system-a system which is a relic of the midd)i ages, and not xuited to the present LatLe of society. I-will also add some of the proposed retmths. Firstly. Shall FeUows be allowed to inarry, and retain their Fellowships? They who have answered this question in the negative have suppored their views by drawing many droUl pictus of the consequences of alowing married Fellows to reside. They have oomically described the disturbing effect of the iatroduction of new centres of attrac. tion in the shape of ptetty nurseukaids. They have pictured the distraotion aid despair of poor -, who is striving hsrd for a FelowAsip, and who, in addition to the muddiness of his brati snd the intricacy of the lunar theory, has to endure the squalls of the cLildren above him, the high sounds of matrimonial contention below, and the incessant and rmonotonmis strumming of Miss-, the daughter of a great Don, 'who is receiving instruction on the piano in the contiguous apartment. The answer to this is that no one in his senses would think of allowing married FeUolws to reside. " If so," say these objectors, " no one 'wiU then be found to fill the College offices." This I flatly deny. In favour of the measure the great argument is that of morality; and any one who read your articles on this subject a few months ago, and also the letters you published at the same time, wil feel its weight. Also those Fellows who mean to wait for College livings, will be able to marry 'when between 20and 30; and will nothave to wait tillthey are 50 or 60-a vast advantage to themselves, their wives, and their parishioners. The tenure of the FellowsBhips must of course be limitedsay, to eight or ten years,-a limitation which would produce most beneficial effeots. RAther more than the present average number of Fellowships would then fall vacant; and, which is much to be desired, a definite number would fall vacant every year. A man might then get his Fellowship 'when he most needs it, immediately after taking his degree. The vegetating class of Fellows would cease to exist if the tenure be limited. Let the Fellowships be made equal, as in some instances has already been done. In many Colleges the Junior Fellowships are scarcely an assistance, and quite insufficient to support anyone. Let the clerical restrictions be loosened. The evils of these restrictions every University man must know and lament. In concluion, I would remark that it is admitted by all that a discretionary power-tust be lodged somewbere. Let it, by all means, be as small as possible, and let it be exerted not to dispense with the conditions of celibacy in certain cases, but rather to permit certain Fellows who hold CoUlege offices, or are occupied in literature or science, and have produced some fruits of their labours, to hold their Fellowships beyond the prescribed term. I am, Sir, your obdient servant- A WRANGLE,R AND EXPECTANT FELLOW. TO THEM EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Tho imemorialists to the University Commissioners mnust, I am sure, feel obliged to you for the very moderate tone with which you have treated the question of the celibacy of Felows. In the hope that you can find space, in the absence of Parliamentary debates, for a few remarks upon the subject-which, indeed, your article seems to challonge-I venture to offer a few lines in reply. I am quite sure that if the subject is generally canvassed with the same impartiality which bas been exhibited by your own columns some change will be effected before long. The great difficulty has appeared to be how to devise some practicable scheme which will meet aU possible objections. About the inexpediency of retaining the present system altogethe:. unchanged there seems to be but little difference of opiion. The restriction of celibacy is certainly a grievance to the individual holders of Fellowsbips, It is true enough that there is no such thing as compulsory celibacy in either University. No Fellow is bound by any vow to abstain from matrimony. But It must be remembered that the punishment which is attached to eating of this forbidden fruit is quite enough to deter men who are fearful of descending in the social scale from taking a step which would probably have the effect of excluding them from such society as that to which they have been aocustomed. The cases which you instance of widows and orphan daughters of Indian civilians are hardly parallel, as such annuitants, upon marriage, look to their husbands for a maintenance, and therefore lose nothing by the change, while the FeUow of a College, if he marries, has increased expenses with diminished income. With respect to other cases, I need only refer you to your own columns in May last, in which you so ably stated the necessity which leads the majority of our young men to defer marriage till a late period in life. AU the arguments you brought forward apply with far greater force to Fellows of Colleges. Refined society, a luxurious table, ample libraries, with other advantages, offer sufficient inducements to the resident FeUow to remain unmarried, yet marriage is the one topic of conversation among Fellows, and the one object which ongages their thoughts. Men who are too timid to go off on a curacy aro not too timid to form "I Imprudent and premature engagements." CoUege tutors, it is weU known, are often engaged for years, and all their leisure time is in that case spent either in paying stolea visits to theirfature brides or in writing letters to them when too far off for a visit. Such a state of thinga must hamper men far more in the performance of CoUege duties than actual marriage. I forbear to speak of the temptation to immorality offered by the present premium on celibacy-a temptation which, unless human nature has changed, is certainly as great now as it was notoriously operative 30 or 40 years ago. The large majority, no doubt, from high principle fight against their natural instincts, but the waut of domestic intercourse and the effect of undeveloped affections are too often detected in that selfish love of ease and unfitness for the duties of society which has given a character to Fellows of CoUeges. It is for resident Fellows that I would urge the removal of the restriction, for aU engaged in tuition or the management of the College property. I quite agree with you that the Fellows who devote themselves to tuition are "' seldom the first in ability." But does not this show that there is something rotten in a system which tends to drive the best men from the University? Why should an able man who chooses education as his profession be in a worse position if he prefers to make the University his place of residence than one who goes down into the country to the more profitable employment of a second-rate school ? It is oa the resident tutors and lecturers that the restriction presses. Non-resident Fellows have opportunities of providing for the future which the residents lose. College lecturers must either make up their minds to perpetual celibacy or linger on for years till a living comes down to them, when the experience they have gained becomes lost to the University, while their unhappy parishioners have to lament the fate which has given them a College for patrons. Such is the prospect of these who devote themselves to the duties of College work. Hlence it is that few undertake College office as a permanent occupation. The niaj ority leave the University as soon as tlhey have obtained their Fellowship. Those who remain behind often do so from a sense of duty, or because they are obliged to take office upon pain of losing their Fellowship. It is clear that men who feel that they are but temporarily settled are not likely to give their undivided attention to present duties. Sparetime, if not frittered away in frivolities, is devoted to preparation for some future sphere. Hence scarcely any of our residents puash their reading beyond a certain point. Their object is to keep up with lectures, and that is all. If Fellowships are to be cousidered merely as prizes, this is another reason why the restriction should be rumoved, in order that the prize may not be shorn of its chief attraction. There are occasionally instances of married men obtaining high places in the honour list. 'Why should such be excluded from College prizes? Let, then, the Fellowships be mnade terminable, with freedom to marry for all who do not reside. Let those who are engaged in lecturing or in the management of College property as bursars hold offlce for life; and let them be free from the restriction of celibacy after seven years' teuure of office. By such a change I am sure that no one would suffer, while all would gain,-the University in the greater efficiency of its tutors, and the country in the increased usefulness of non-resident Fellows. I would only add that I hope the University Commissioners wiU do away with the restriction of holy orders, and that they will devise some plan for utilizing the Heads of CoUeges, who at present draw some 50,000 a-year from the two Universities without any corresponding advantages to education. I am, Sir, your obedient spvv-, A RES1DENT,

RAThWAY INELLIGENCE. 46? GRPUT 'Wv,;tTizp-v It appears the directous of tbis company are taking active measures to redue as far a possible the working e"pen of their vaious lines, A number of the daily trains have been discontinued this imonth, an arrangemnentwhich willocossdon a commensurate diminutionn tin he outlay for milea. The locomotive establishment St Swindon wiUl also participate in the Reneral curtailment, 300 of the artisans employed at the works having already received notice to leave the company's servioe. LANCASTER AND CARLISLE. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at lAncaster on Friday. Mr. Hasell, chairnsn of the company, presided. The statement of accounts shows a balance of 93,578&, out of which the directors recommend a dividend to be paid at the rate of 8 per cent, per annum, which, with the proportion payable to the Lanc3ster and Preston PUailway Company and the interest on loans, will require 89.3881., and a farther sum to be carried to the renewal fund of 2,0001, and towards Parliamentary expenses of 1856 8001.; total, 92,1881.; leaving a balance of 1,3891. The Secretary read the report,which, after congratulatin the sharelolders on the good position of their line, adverted to the oponing of the Lancaster and Ulverston Una, of the proposed formation of the South Darham Line, and to some other less important matters. Negofations had been opened with the lendal and Windermere ailway Company, at their suggestion, Sor an amalgamation of their undertaking writh this company, the terms of such amalgamation to he effected by means of arbitration on the basis of the relative vlues of the tvvo lines. The general terms of the agreement having been amicably settled, and the usual formal agreement of referene having been sealad by both companies, leaving nothing unsettled except the proportion of the net earnings of the united undertakings which should belong to the Kendal and Windermere, the question was by such formal agzcesment left to the arbitration of hr. W. Rotheram of Liverpool, who had been selected by the Kendal ani Windermere. Each cornpany sent written statements of their respective cases to the arbitrator, who called for such further explanations as he deemed requisite, and after retracted consideration awarded that the Kendal and Windermere should have one 30 38th (1-30th and 38 decimals) part of the net earnings of the urted undertakings, whlch would atone give the Eendal and Windermere above 6,0001. per annum. Upon receipt of the award the directors signifaed their acceptance of it to the rendal and Windermere board. Two meetings wvere held to consider this matter by tbe Kendal and Windermere. At the last, held oa the 27th ult., it was resolved:- "It appearing thst much doubt exists satthesunto be receired by the K.euda oanaWindermerein thttsT.otthe awar bymr.Rotberarn, reolved that this meetlng sacept the award upon the understanding that it gives to this oir any one thirtieth arm 38 one-hundredth parts of another thirlieth ot t1,e net levenues or the Joint companies, but refuses the award upon any other interpretation." Interprcted, this resolution means nothing more nor less than that the Kendal and Windermere will decline to carry the award into effect unless the Lancaster and Carlisle wM give 2,G001. a-year more for the undertaklng than they can get either by going to law upon the technical wording of the award made by their selected arbitrator, or than they are fairly entitled to in his opinion as such arbitrator. Such being the facts of the case, the directors are not disposed to advise an appeal to law, notwithstand. ing they have been advised that Mr. Rotheram's award bears the interpretation which he intended. The directors have declined a proposal received within the last few days from the Keudal and Windermere board for renewed negotiations, and have no hesitation at all in ad. vising the shareholders to allow the matter to drop, only regretting the result as it affects the public. *heC nAsmrAN, in moving the adoption of thereport, said, -At no former period had their undertaking stood upon a moresubstantial footing than at thepresenttime,and of this there could not be a more striking evidence than that their traffic had increased, while their working expensesremained as before. This was the worst half year, and yet they pro. posed to declare a dividend of 8 per cent. They also ld by for their ordinary requirements of renewal fund the usual amount of 2,0001., and at the same time pay a certain part of parliamentary expenses incurred in a former contest. Since the last meeting several transactions had terminatei most successfully, Parliamoent having granted them the line which wasproposedtobe made from Lowgilt to Tebay, a course which the North-Western wished to divert. Theyhadobtained tbat line withouttanyre. strictionwhatever.JadtheNorth-Westerncriedtheirpoint. there would have been, had it gone to Carlisle, a line against theirs, with competing traffic. He anticipated that the Uilverston 1ailway, just opened, would bring on the Lancaster and Carlisle Conompany a great deal of traffic. He regretted that the award in reference to the Kendal and Windermere line had not been accepted. Mr. HOWARD seconded the adoption of the report. Mr. GILLOW showed by statistics that the Lancaster and Carlsle Company would effect a great saving by working their line themselves, and said that in two years hence the line would pay 10 per cent. In reply to a question, The UHAI.RMA? said, they had purchased 40 locomotives from the London and North-Western Company, at a cost of 54,7801. They had selected 25 of this number, and the remaining 15 were assigned to them by arbitration. Aftersome remarks from Mfr. WnriTNvw., Ir. Sw=r, and Mr. GRA.iNT, the report was adopted. A dividend of 8 per cent. was then declared. Mr. Hosell was re-elected director, and Mr. Saunders was chosen director in the place of Mr. Gsrnett, rcsgned; Mar. P. Braithwaite was re elected auditor- and Mr. W. Jackson re-elected director on the part of the Pieston and Is,usatprj Railway Co pavy. A Yote of thanks was voted to the Chairman, and the' mneeting terminated. COLCHESTER AND STOUR VALLEY. At the half-yearly meeting of this company, held at the office, Colchester, Mr. T. L. wen in the chair, the report stated that the directors had appropriated all the surplus rent received from the Eastern Counties Company in liquidation of the bond debt, which had been reduced from 84.02.5 (the amount on June 30, 1856) to 23,1501 The CHAIR3MSN, in moving the adoption of the report, congratulated the proprietors upon the fact that the bond debt was becoming "small by degrees and beautifully less." Mr. COLEIAN seconded the motion for the adoption of the report, wbich was carried unanimously. M1r. TURNERB moved that the resolution of July, 1856, suspending the issue of 51. preferential shares, be rescinded, and that in accordance with a resolution passed in August, 1855, the same be offered to the holders of original shares, and if not taken np by them to the public. Mr. Tarner stated that 10,000 or 12,000 of the shares would be readily disposed of, and if this was the case very few would remain to be offered to the public. Mr. HAVENS seconded Mr. Turner's proposition. After some conversation, in the course of which it was determined that only so many sbares should be issned as would prove sufficient to pay off the remainder of the bond debt, the directors were authorized to carry out the arrangement. Mr. TlIRNxER stated that the company had now an income of 9,5001., the only charge upon which would be about 1,5001., the interest on the preference shares. The proceedings closed with a vote of tbanks to the chair. nlan and directors. OSWESTRY AND NEWTOWN. On Friday a special meeting of this company was held at Welahpool, to consider the Propriety of rescinding a resolution of the 5th of October, 1855, fixing the eon pany's offices and the mieetings of the shareholders at Weilshpool; Sir Watkein W. WVynn, Bart., X.P., presided. The CHSAIRMaN having briefly explained the object of the meeting, Mr. RIeCfARD JoNEs proposed " That the resolution of October, 1855, so far as regards the company's offices, be rescinded, and that the offlces be forthwith removed to Oewestry until such time as the interests of the company may appear to require their removal elsewbere." This was seconded by Mr. BROUCUTO-T. After considerable discussion a show of hands was taken, and The C,AiRMyA declared the majority to be against the motion. Mr. JONES then demanded a poll, and Messrs. W. Wilding and George Lewis were appointed scrmtineers. The result of the polling was as follows :_ Pewnt, Proxiese Total. For the motion .. 2.54 1,016 1,270 Against the motion ... ... 6SO 804 1,484 Majority against the motion ... 21 . 4 2L4 (Cheers.) A vote of thanks having been passed to the chairman the meeting separated. GLASGOW AND SOUTH-WESTERY. The report of the directors of this company states that the total expenditure on capital account to the 31s' ' July last amounted to 4.5566,0S5l. The rolling stock is reported to be in a very efficient state of repair. An additional supply of 100 large mineral waggons has been obtained, and will be quite adequste to meet the increasing d&mand for some time. The traffio of the company in every d,partment continues steadily to increase. Tle passenger traffic shows an increase of 2,677T. over that of the corresponding half of 1856.

The annual revenue of the company aumounted, for theyear ending July, 1855, to 290.5261. ; ending July, 1856, to 313,0621.; and ending July :31,1857, to 347.542., showing an increase of 22,5361, or 7i per cent. in 1856 overl8;5, and of 34,4801 ,or 11 per cent. in 1857 over 1856, or an addition to the traffic for the first half of 1857 of 19. per cent. over that of the first half of 185,. The working eipenses amount to 40 ner cent. of the receipts. The total mileage performed during the half-year has been 896,810 miles, or an increase of ,972 miles over the correspondir,gperiod of 1S56. An extraordinary expenditure of 6,7431. has taken place this half-year in relaying the line, which has been met by charging 3,094. against the revenue, and appropriating the balance of 3,6494 at the credit of the renewal of way fund. The average rate of interest now pavable on the borrowed capital of the company is 41. 2s. 9'2d. per cent. The bonds fallng due in November next are considerably under their usual amount. The revenue account sbows that after deduction of all proper charges there remains a disposable sum of 81,396'. Of this balauce the sbareholders are recommended to appropriate 79,4091. in declaring a dividend on the several stocks and shares of the company at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, payable on the 21st inst. (deducting income-tax), eavngabalance of 1,9871. The directors intend to dispos3 of the ordinary stock which has been held by the company for several years, to the extent of 121,52.. This amount will be allotted rateably among the sbareholders at par, and, should it not nil be taken up by the proprietors, the direc- tors have power to dispose of the remainder at not less than par. The promoters of the British and Irish Grand Junction ailway have obtained their Act of Incorporation. The Government authorities have under. taken that the harbour of Port Patriek shall be improved and made sitable for carrying on the traffic with Ireland simultaneously with the completion of 'f Orand Jonctloe BEilway to that pert.

The Ayr and Dalmellington *nd the Ayr and llsybole Junction Bailrayq are both worked by tie company. The trafic of thbew lines is increasing, and tends to augment the revenue of the main line. The capital account shows that 4 446,8191. had been received, and 4,556,0851. expended, including 294,640& in railway sbocks held by the company, leaving a balance of 109,2651. against the company. The revenue aoconnt for the half-year ending the 31st of July showed that 175,284. had been received and 74,7721 expended in working and other charges, leaving a balance of 100,512L The receipt< for passengers amounted to 4s. 10d. per trxin mile, and for goods to 3s. 11 d. per train mile. The averLge expenditure per train mile for passengers amounted to ls. 10id., and for goods to I& 9dLd. The return of working stock showea that there were 41 passenger engines and tenders, 58 goods' engines, 63 fint-class carriages, 57 second-class, 65 thirdclass, and 7 composite carriages; 39 horse hos,26 ca6e trucks, 887 goode tracks, 110 cattle trucnks 24i parcel and good' vans, 2450 mineral waggons, and 39 coke waggons. OPENING OF THE BANFF, MACDUFF, AND TUBRRIFF. This ralrway, which may be sid to be an offshoot of the Great North of Scotland Railway, was opened on Friday, Ihen a party of about 400 dined together in honour of the oocaaion. A *pecial t-rsin left Ab-erdeen at noon, anid wax the frst to ran over the new line. The train was received at the terminus at Turriff by a Large concourse of spectators. All along the line at prominent points flags were displayed, and the etations were crowded by people chearing the trin as It passed. The line runs through a most beautiful and fertile district. This branch will form part of a line to the east coast from the main trunk, and thus bring it into dl. rect communication with London. Theodinner party assembled in an engine shed, attacbed to which wasaxnarquee. Mr. Gordon, of Fyvie, occupied the chair, and, &R rne of the landed proprietors of the district, expresQd himself zreatly pleased to see the train runming through his property and opening up a new district of country.~~~~~~~~Eran Lord HADDO, 1L.P., followed in a similar strain.

LOSS OF THE MAIL STEAMSHIP BREL. At the Greenvvich Police-court on Saturday Mr. Trail, assisted by Captain Sullivan, R.N., held an officia1 Inquiry into the loss of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's ship Erin, of 850 tons burden, which was wrecked on the east coast of Cevlon, on the 6th of Jnne last, -while conveying Hetr Majesty's mail, treasure, specie, and a large cargo of opium, to the amount of 200,0001,, from Bombay to Point de GaUle and China. Mr. Cumberland attended from the Board of Trade, and Mr. Stenning, of the firm of M'Leod and Stenning, of Fenchurch-street, appeared on behalf of the company. MIr. Cumberland stated that the ship left Bombay on the 1st of June for Point de Galle and China, and continued her proper course until tha 6th of June, when she suddenly struck. The main question for inquiry ws now whether the proper soundings had been taken and such meaur adopte as might have saved the ship. Srancis Bayley sAid,-I am in the eervice of the Peninsular anTOrfeffttl %auif Navtgation Company, and am 29 years of age. I hate a certificate of competency from the Board of Trade, dated AuguLst 7, 1852. I was captain of the paddle steamer Erin belonging to tbat company. I have been five years In the service of the company, and master of the Erin since January last, having previously commanded a steamer from September, 186, to January, 1857, belonging to the company, on the Canton river. Before that I was chlef officer of the EBn for two years, first between Bombay and China, for 12 months, and afterwards from Hongkoag and Kurr&chee. I had made the same voyage about 12 times before between Bombiy and China and Point deGaile. On the 1st of Juno last I sailed in the Edn from Bombay at half-past 1 in the afternoon, having treasure and a cargo of opinm, valued at 200,0001., on board. The ship also carried the mails, and there were eight or ten passengers. The crew consisted of 42 Lascars as sailors, and six hIanilla men as steersme. Thero were four European officers, four cngineers, and four firemen. This was the proper complement of men, and the ship was in good order and properly equipped. On the 5th of June, at noon, iat. 7' 2a', and loag. 77 55' 30' E. was the actual position of the ship. We steered from that point S.E. by E. southerly true course. The compass course was S.E. by E. E R, and the deviation was about 6 degrees E. At 4 p.m. 1 again made observations, and the longitude by chronometer gave 78° 27' 15' R, and latitude by account 7''1 0' E. We were tben going from 9 to 9. knots. At 9 o'clockp.m. lobeerved the meridian altitudeUosa Nlyajor gave latitude 6' 36'N., the longitude by accountbeing 7S' 57' E. It was then a particularly clear night, the moon near the full, and I could have seen the land for at least 10 miles off at that time. I left orders with Mr. Baynton, the officr of the watch, to caM me if it came at all hazy or thick, or if he saw anytbing, and also to call me between hal-past 2 and a quarter to 3 in the morning. I left the deck between half-past 9 and 10, and was awoke about a quarter to 1 by the ship's striking. My cabin was on deck, and the door partly open. I was on deck in an instant. The engines were going at full speed. Tnere was then a squall passing, and I saw the land onthe port beam. I caled out, "11Hard a-port," and the officer of the middle watch, Mr. Gregory, then came to me and said, " It is coming up thick,' or some such expression. This was after the ship struck. She was also striking violently at the time. Not more than two or three seconds elapsed between my hearing the ship strike and going out upon deck. The engines were stopped at once. I afterwards went on tho paddlebox and tried to get her ofi, but she was hard and fast on the rock. John Charles Baynton sald,-I am in the service of the Peninsular and Oriental Navigation Company, and third officer on board the Erin. I have been rather more than two years in the service of the company as third officer, and before that time I served [n various sailing vessels. I hAve a certificate of competency from the Board of Trade dated June, 1854. I sailed on board the Emn as third officer from Bombay on the 1st of June. On Friday, the 5th of June, I recollect comparing my observations shortly after 12 o'clock with the captain's and second officer's, and my longitude was 7' 58', varying three miles to the eastward. All the officers work by different chronometers The second officefs observations were the sane. Our latitudes agreed. My wach on that night was first watch-from 8 to 12. At 9 o'clock p.m. I saw the captain on deck with his instrument. The captain told me to look out for a star. The captain left the deck about a quarter to 10, and gave me orders to keep a strict look-out and call him immediately if it came on at aUl thick, and to pass the same orders to Mr. Gregory, who would succeed me at tho next watch. The captain gave me the orders to steer S.E. by E. half E., and to call him at a quarterto 3. Thatcoursel continued steering during my watch, towards the remainder of which by constant inspection I found that that course was steered. I am certain that during my watch that course was not varied, for I went to the wheel about every ten minutes. We bad a standard and binnacle compass on board. I had not oompared them that day nor during my watch. We were steering by binnacle. The log was hove every hour from 8 to 12. The shp was going at an even speed of from 9 to 9. knots per hour. The weather was very fine duriDg the first part of my watcb. The sky was clear until about 11, with bright moon, and light fresh breeze from the north-west. All sails were set, and the engines on at full speed. Between 1i and 12 it became overcast, the moon and stars being obscured by clouds. There was no haze. This was the state of the weather until I left at 12 o'clock. In that state of the vweather, in my opinion, I should have seen land on that particular coast ti or seven miles off. I was relieved by Mr. Gregory, and transmitted to him the orders I had received from the master, making him repeat them afterwards. I then left the deck. John L. Gregory, third or supplementary officer, who was not sworn, was next examined, and after he had made his statement, Mr. TraiU, Captain Sullivan, and M[r. Cumberland retired for a short time, and on their return to court, Mr. TBM,= said, he and Captain Sullivan had held some conversation with respect to the inquiry under consideraton, and had come to the concluion that the certificate of Captain Bayley with his (Mr. Traill's) report should be forwarded to the Board of Trade, when, in all probability, reference would be made to tho conduct of the third superior officer. A PREOUS CARCO.-Sir John Dean Paul, Strahan, Bates, Robson, Agar, Tester, Saward (alims Jem the Penman), together with the notorious swindler Redpath, are on board the Nile convict ship, which vessel, about noon on Saturday, got under weigh from the Little Nore, made sail and proceeded towards the Downs with a strong south-west wind,-Glo'e.,
