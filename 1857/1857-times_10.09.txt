GEHAT 2?OBHERN RAILWAY ACCDRNT. TO 'EE IDITO OF TME TIMES. Sir,-The inquiry into the late terrible accident on the, Great Northern Ba-ilwayhas isow closed, and the result, it car hardly bo denied, is most unsatisfactory. The publio a& left as much in the dark as ever how this dreadful crash. was occasioned, and, except your own general advice to avoid excesdve speed and fast trains, no remedy seems tcx have been proposed. Bat in these days fast trains are sure, to run, as the Americans will use river steamers of high pressure, in spite of periodicl alarms and all the cantions of prudent men~ Whoever, then, can so far explain the cause of such catastrophes as to suggest a ample expedient that would greatly lemen the risk of their recurrence, and also the disoomfort of railway travelling by ordinary tralas, must be a benefactor of the public. It is with this view that I venture to ask for a little space in your columns. And, first, what probable account can be given of the cause of the accident? The train was moving at the rate of 55 miles an hour, or 80 feet per second. It wonld need 2V seconds for a body to gain this velocity faUing freely irvacuo. To stop such a train inihalf a second would requir a pressure of five times its own weight; to stop it in 20i feet a pressure equal to its own weight; and in 200 yards a pressure of one-third of its whole weght. This shows the immense friction required when the break is suddenly applied in. order to avert a threatened collision. When such a train ascends a gradient or gets up its speed after stopping there is a poll by the coupling irons in the centre of every carriage, and except on rounding a curve there can then be little or no risk on a good line of lateral osciUation. When, however, the crest of a gradient has been reached, at a rate below the average, the eDgineer naturally seeks toc make up lost time and keep up the force of the steam on the first part of the decline. But when he has thus overpushed the average rate, like a bank with excesive paw iSsues, the time comes when he must ease the regulator" and lessen the tractive power,I so as to retarda speed which he thinks excessive and dangerous. It is in this process of retardation, to avoid danger, that the chief danger begins> The backward push is not, liko the pull, in the centre of the train, but is given by the buffers on the two sides. It consist6 in a succession of abrupt and violent jerks. Suppose each buffer of the two hind [carriages to yield an inch when com. pressed, and that the engine, moving 55 miles an hour, suddenly lowers its speed one fifth. A speed of 11 miles an hour, or 16 feet i er se iond, has to be extinguished suddenly in each carriage in the time that one gains two inches on thoother, or in the 96th part of a second. Thls implies a, pressure equal to 48 times the weight of the lighter carriage, Now, suppose further that the twvo pair of buffers on the two sides do not project equally, but those on the left side meet one-tenth of an inch sooner than the others Thesec must form, as soon as they touch, a temporary pivot, around which thecarriage beginstoswing tillit is brought up by the contact on the opposite side. This swinging motion, as it sets the carriage awry, must produce unequal action on the carriage beyond, and the evil wiU propagate itself through the whole series, and its cumulative effect wil be felt in the gumrd's van or the hindmost carriage. It would increase with every fresh contact of the buffers i it were notchecked by the grip of the hind wheels of each carriage on the rails. Every one who has been a assenger near the end of a fast train must repeatedly have ~elt diEcomfort, if not serious alarm, from this violent side oscilaion. A pressure equal t,o 40 or 50 times the weight o£ the carriage, brought up repeatedly in a smal fracrion of a second by blows not quite simultaneous on the two sides of the carriage, could not fail to have this unpleasant and dan. gerous consequence. The conservative power, on which the safety of the whole train depends, is the lateral pressure of the flanges of the wheels upon the rails, and chiexly of the hind wheels of the last carriage. But from their circular shape it is only a very smaU part of these wheels which can exercise the salutary presur Besides, they are in rapid revolution, and, unlss the whole line is exceedingly smooth, they wi be liable to a series of slight leaps, lifting them up from the rails. We have only, then, to suppose that one of these vertical leaps of two or three inches coincides with a moment of the greatest lateral pressure or swing of the end carriage, and the result is as natural as it must often be terrible. The& end wheels and the end carriage are thrown off the rails Each drags its neighbour aside, and before the break can b3 effectualy used-perhaps before the engine-driver is aware of what has happened behind-the whole train may be turned into a gigantic slaughterhouse-a mass of shapeless It is surely a most practical question whether tbere is no, means of removing or abating this serious danger, which occasions chronic uneasiness and discomfort, and leads now and then to consequences quite appalUin. Now, it seemsto me that there is a remedy, easyand aimpl e in its application, which would reduce the hazard and discomfort to one tithe only of its present amount, and which ought, I think, at least to have an early trial by all our railway engineers. Our fast trains, in reality, are now like ships sailing under a press of wind or steam without any rudder. Givo them a decent rudder, and the steadiness so woefnUy and dangerously lacking will be at once restored. The plan I would suggest is as follows :-Let there be two iron shoes, two or three feet in length, fittirg to the rail with moderate tightness, and fastened by a cross bar of iron at the proper distance of the gauge. Let this double shoe have two stems about a foot high, and then. turning horizontally with arms three or four feet in length, or stil longer, if not otherwise inconvenient. At the end of the van, or hind carriage, let two holow cylinders of iron be, fixed firmly, into whfich the stems of the double shoe may fit very tightly, and be clamped firmly by cross-bolts or other easy fastening. The shoes, of course, shouild turn up slightly at the ends to avoid catching at any alight unevenness on tho rails. W hat would be the effect of this simple "railway rudder?' The retaining power, instead of depending on a smaU segment of the hind wheels, themselves in rapid mot on, and lifted up by their own centrifugal force with every slight disturbance, will depend on the whole length of the doube, shoe, which might be made to fit more deeply on the rail, and which would be two or three feet in length, instead of four or five inches. Besides this triple superiority, of greater length, of more complete hold on the rails, and a steady, uniform slide in place of rapid revolution, there will be p fourth cause of stabilitT, as they will act at nearly double the leverage. I think it probable that by this simple expe. dient the oscillation might be reduced to one-tenth of ite actual amount, and the risk of being thrown off the line, which only begins when the oscillation is great, would olcourse be diminished in a stiU greater degree. Trusting that the importance of the subject may obtain a- place for these remarks in your widely-circulated Journal, and is.ue, with the blessing of God, in the great mitigation of an evil by which thousands of lives are now endangered, I remain. vours rmsne,Atf.11 T. r.

MONRY-MARKBT and OITYINTPLL1GBNcRNB. Thursday Evening. The Bank of England have advanced their rate Mf discount to-day from 5i per cent., at vhich it had itood since the 16th of July, to 6 per cent. The suddenness of the renewed drain of gold 'which has led to this step has taken the public by surprise, because they were not prepared for the extraordinary news by the two last American mails. Allowing due weight to that inteligence, there is nothing in the movement to create alarm, although there is a high probability it may soon have to be repeated. The trade of this country with the United States represents an annual total of 40,000,0001., and it is impossible for any financial trouble to occur on one side without its being deeply felt on the other. During the last two years we have had many opportunities of observing the sensitivemess with which we respond to monetary perturba. tions in France, but our relations of commerce and -capital with that country are altogether insignificant in comparison. A panic iu New York, therefore, 'which sends the rate of discount to a point ranging between 20 and 50 per cent., and which is continued 'with intensity for five or six weeks, must necessarily subject us to severe temporary preaure; and if the Inoonvenience should be limited to a rise of a half or even one per cent. in the value of money we shall have reason to congratulate ourselves, and to aecept 'the fact as another proof of the inherent soundness -of our general position. For more than a month .past not only has every payment due to us from America been as far as possible suspended, but special credits have been eagerly made use of, calls on railway stocks largely held here have been anrmiunced (in one case alone for an amount approaching a quarter of a million sterling), and draughts authorized for the purchase of securities by English capitalists, tempted by a fall in prices, from which they conceive there cannot fa.ilto be an early reaction. It is scarcely too much to auume that in this way a million or a million and a half sterling has been already withheld, or absorbed from us, that would otherwise have been in our possession at this moment, and the prospect is that the process will go on for some time longer. It must also be considered that at the same period we have been despatehing the most costly feet of transports ever employed at one moment with thIrty or forty thousand troops to India, the -outlay upon which in the shape of stores, fuel, &c., -cannot have fallen much short of half a million, for which we shall get nothing until the return of the vessels from Calcutta, as the payments from the Indian Government -will not be made till a certain number of days after the arrival -of the vessels at that port. The India-house, at home, moreover, in order to lighten as far as possible the liabilities of the territorial Go-vernment, are abstaining from drawing the usual -amount of revenue required from that side for the payment of dividends and other purposes, and have thus found it necessary to borrow a million from the Bank. Upon the whole, therefore, it is possible that the combined operation of the American panic and the Indian insurrection may for the time have affected our resources to the extent of two or three nillions. A decline of about a million in the bullion of the Bank is usually followed by an advance of a half per cent. in the rate of discount. It would -consequently seem that these adverse influences, as they have borne upon us to three times that -amount, mnight have caused a rise of one-and-a-half 8per cent., and that it is only through some favoirable counteracting circumstancee that that zesult has been delayed or prevented. These are to hbe found in the abundant harvest and the change in *he silk-market, as well as in the supplies of Indian produce, which has in some degree diminished the specie shipments by the last and the preceding Overland maiL Bad the relief thus afforded happened in ordinary course, we should now, probably, have seen the rate of discount at 4 per cent. As it 4s, it has simply enabled us to limit the rise for the present, at all events, to G, instead of carrying it to '7 per cent. 'Under these circumstances, this is no smal satisfaction; but there is reason to believe that, weven if further stringency should be experienced, we are not in any danger of seeing the approaching 'vinter ushered in by a very extensive series of commercial disasters. Of course, the American failures mu st have told heavily on individual houses on this side, and there are also several branches of -costly produce which have experienced wide fluctuations that may disturbthe casual fortunes of speculators. There are likewise at all times a number of infirm establishments carrying on their business from hand to mouth, to whom a rise of a half per -cent. in the rate of discount after any long period of pre.sure is an inevitable sentence of destruction, and it i usually at the end of the year that such cases are developed. But as regards the broad trade of the empire, it is impossible to discern a cause of fear. :Montlh by month our commercial payments increase in magnitude, and yet are met with a punctuality never surpasued, and all the leading bankers will testify that, thus far, there is an absence even of those premonitory symptoms which invariably warn them of the possibility of a coming struggle lon.7 before the community at large have become awakened to It. Hence the belief may be confi-dently indulged that, although, with our universally diffused transactions, we must necessarily participate in every shock that occurs elsewhere-and there never was a time when prudence was more essential -our commercial prosperity, notwithstanding the Sepoy mutiny, is destined still to continue a marvel to the world. The funds opened this morning at the closing quotations of Tueaday, but subsequently experienced a fall of nearly three-eighths per cent. The first 'ranmactions in Consols for money were at 894 to 90, from which, on the announcement of the alteration In thc Bank rate of discount, they declined to s91 to 7 At this they remained till near the termination of business, when the market showed increased 'weakness, the finsl prices being 890 for money and 900 to i for the new account on the 1 0th of November. The gloom at the end of the day was principaUy oWing to a report that the features of the Bank return to be published to-morrow evening will be -much worse than has been anticipated, and but for -the announcement of the arrival at Southampton of the expected 380,oOol., brought by the last Australian mail, stlll greater depression would have been -excerienced. India Stock left off at 207 to 210; India Bonds, 23s. to 17s. discount; andExchequerbills, 8s. to 4& discount. The discount establishment have inerased their rate of allowance to 5i per cent. for money at call, -and to 5w per cent. for deposits with short notice, beLng an advance of a half per cent. The rate of the joint-stook banks for deposits will be 5 per cent. The applications at the Bank to-day were numerous both before and after the alteration. In the discount-market some exceptional transactions have been negotiated at 51, but the curreut rate for the ehoicest paper seems to be only an eighth below the Bank minimum. The foreign stock-market has been rather active, but the only alteration of importance has been a decline in Turkish. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 100A and 99k; Granada Neew Active, 21I; Mexican, lor the account, 20.- aud 21; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 78i and ditto, Three per Cents., 544; Sardinian, 90, 89', and 904; Spanish, for the account, 401; ditto, N'ew Deferred, 254, and 4; Swedisb, 834 and 83; Turkish Six per Cents, 94; ditto, for the account, 4, and i;rthe Four per Cents. Guaranteed 99d ; and Dutoh Four per Cent. Certifieatee, 98S The French Three per Cents, experienced a deoine yesterday of three-eighths per cent., and the losing quotations this evening on the Bourse were 7f. 45c. for money, asnd 67f. 65c. for the end of ibe month, showing a further fall of a quarter per Aeent. The Anm?icaa cnisis ia felt severoly at Paris, tho remittances from New York on French account being delayed in the same manner as those to London, Money, w;rhich a week or two back was comparatively ini good supply, is consequently in great demand, and nothing is obtainable belowthe charge of the B7ank of Fance. t is said the Government have lately urged a reduction in the rate of discount, and that the Bank, unable altogether to resist these influences, adopted on that account the recent relaxation in the margin required in advances oa stocks and shares. The prospect now is, that even this measure will have to be rescinded. The Bank of Holland have to-day raised their rate of discount to 54 per cent., an unusually high point for that establishment. It is only three weeks since the previous alteration waa made, from 4* to 5 per cent. The letters by the last American steamer, while they show tbat the panic has assumed proportions which the most timid had failed to contemplate, contain nothing to alter the view that fright alone is the main cause of the daily ruin, and that there is nothing in what is now pasting which will for any length of time interfere with the businesw or cripple the natural resources of the country. The extent cf disaster, however, is most extraordinary, especially at Pbiladelphia, which at one time disputed with New York the claim to be considered the financial centreof the Union. Herenearlyallthebanks have suspended, including three whose aggregate capital arnounts to 800,0001 The chief of these is the Bank of Pennsylvania,foundedmorethan GOyearsago, and which has for some time conducted the business of the Government, paying the dividends on the State debt, &c. Its capital was 375,0001.; its note circulation, 1l0,0001.; and its deposits, 390,0001. The next is the Girard Bank, an institution of scarcely inferior standing, and which enjoyed the account of the city corporation. The capital in this case is 250,000l., and the circulation nearly 100,0001. The third is the Commercial, with a capital of 200,0001., anda circulationof 52,(0JOI. The Merchantb' Bank and several otherzhadalso stopped,and whenthe mail left the impression was that in the general rush the remainder would be forced to a similar F,tep. At Baltimore concerted action seems to have been resolved upon at once, and it is probable that the simultaneous stoppage will be found in the end greatly to have lessened the mischief for all parties. The mercantile failures at Philadelphia had almost all occurred before the banks went down. They had been exceedingly numerous, and as a large number were among importers of European goods some heavy losses must necessarily fall on shippers from England and France. The liabilities of Caleb Cope and Co., an old-established silk firm, areistated at 140,0001. Those of Richard Patterson and Co., a sugar house, would also prove large, and were likely to cause embarrassments at New Orleans. The names of the other firms are too numerous to detail. Meanwhile at Nevr York there had been no great increase of pressure. Several additional failures had taken place, but they were not of remarkable magnitude, and the banks during the week had been strengthened by an increase of 270,0001. in their stock of bullion, notwithatax ding the loss of the 400,0001. by the Central America. At Cincinnati and other places in the West there was likewise comparative steadiness. A report at New York that the Chicago, St. Paul, and Fond du Lao Railway had failed to provide for their floating debt of 300 0001 and had made an asignment, had been contradicted. The Delaware, Lackawana, and WVestern Railway, with a similar floating debt, had, however, been compelled to take that course. The committee of investigation of the Miehigan Southern Railway had issued a report stating the capital of the concern to be 2,000,0001., its bonded debt 1,400,0001., and its floating liabilities 350,0001. At the meeting of the shareholders of the New York and Erie it was announced that the floating debt is about 500,0001., and a committee was appointed to confer as to the measures for raising a loan to pay it off. Estimates were given of the working of the line for the current year, commencingthe 1st of July, to show that 3i might be expected to be realized as dividend upon the capital stock of 2,200,0001. The Bond debt is 5,0(00,0001. Several railway companies were arrarging uniform measures of economy and reform, and also in somne cas,es an increase of their tariff. The establishment of regulations for the New York Stock Board, on the basis of the excellent ones of the London Stock-Exchange, was also strongly urged. An article in the T2%ibune helps to explain the occurrence of the present pressure while every mercantile interest appeared in a favourable condition, and confirms the impression that it is owing almost entirely to the railway distrust, aggravated as that has been by the efforts of an organized band of speculators. The bonds and stocks of these companies have been widely held by men of business, and trusted to as a -eserve in case of need. Many of the banks, especlally the inferior ones, have pursued the same course, and suddenly the whole of these millions of securities have been found totally unmarketable, except at sacrifices that involve ruin to their possessors. The quotations from the New York stock-market on this occasion show no great increase of unsteadiness. Erie had fallen from 171 to 16g, New York Central from 066 to (65J, and Reading from 41i to 37i. Illinois Central remained at 88, and Michigan Southern at 19. An extraordinary meeting,Tof the Electric and International Telegraph Company was held this afternoon, MIr. J. L. Ricardo, M.P., in the chair, for the purpose of raising the residue of the authori7ed sbare capital. The chairman observed that their debentures will soon fall due, and that from the nature of the company's property, which does not admit of so good a security being given as in the case of railways, a renewal cannot be effected except on very unfavourable terms. By the statutes of the company the greatest amount of any call is limited to 51., and in order, therefore, to procure about 115,0001., the sum required, the directors propose to allot the whole of the remaining authorized capital unissued-viz., 489,0004, pro ratd, to the shareholders, giving them the option of taking their share or not. Upon this new capital a call of 61. will be made, 21.10s. to be payable in three or four weeks, and the same sum in February next. A resolution embodying the directors' proposition was agreed to unanimously, and a contribution of one hundred guineas was voted to the Indian Relief Fund. It was stated in the coure of the meeting that the company have 5,439 miles of telegraph open, 430 stations, and 2,172 instruments oonstantly working. The Tyne mail steamer, for Brazil, will take out ,200(1. in gold and 10, 01. in silver, together 17,8501. The Queen of May has arrived from China with 363,4001b. of tea.
TE& CnIOLPn.L-We know now what claw of persons will furnish by far the greater number of vietims to cholera, and on what street-it may almost be said on what house-it will descend. The season at which its appearance may be expected ia a subject of somewhat less certainty; but the unimportant doubt to which it Is open cannot be supposed to affect the necesity of our precau. tions. On one occasion, after manifesting itself at Ham. burg in September, it has been among us in November; while, on others, it has been held in check for a time by the early advent of a cold season, only to break out at the beginning of the following summer. We cannot predict which precedent will be followed now, but we know that the disease will come ; and we can lay our fingers, without the slightest liability to error, on the weak places which it wiU assail and invest. Were any experienced officer of health to go, for instance, through Manchester, he could mark out every square yard of spaoe on which the disease wDl probably settle, and trace the course which it will take as soon as the congenial season gives the signal for Its rising. If such knowledge as this had been imparted to us without poweor of arerting ths danger we must foresee it is hardly ible that a greater auras could have descended upon man. ze far, however, is this terrible state of impotent anticipation from being our real conditIon, that just as surely as we know wvhen the cholera wiUl burst forth from its smouldering ashes and where it will make its most destruotive rayages, so surely we know how to check its appearanoe in some quarters and mitigate its foroe in all; and the precanu tiens which we may adopt for this purpose will not be uper'duous If the visitation which we apprehend should be wthheld, inasmuch as they wiU bar the progress of other dteasee which are never absent from among us, and inereas the moral as well as the physical wellbeing of Wsity,_.

RAILWAY AND MINING SHABR!S. Thursday Evening. Railway shares have again been depreesed, and a further considerable decline has taken place, Great Northern especially receding upwards of 21. The fall continued after official hours, and at 4 o'clock the market closed heavily. The state of the funds and speculative and other sales have combined to exercise an adverse influence. Canadian shares were flatter, and a small reduction occurred in Sciiide. Foreign descriptions were generally lower, Eastern of France declining 11. In American, Illinois Central and NewYork and Erie showed increased weakness. There was a fair amount of business transacted in mines, but prices were generally unaltered, the only important variation being an advance in East Bassett. Joint-stock banks shared the general depression, and a decline took place in Australasia, City, and South Australia. In miscellaneous securities the announcement of the issue of new stock caused a fall in Electric Telegraph; Canada Land and National Discount were also lower. ORDINAMY RIlAnRa sAn 1 R7

RAILWWAY INTELLrGENCE. GREA,T W RtIPRp nJ fm' AAT. nA The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yeater. day at the ondon Tavern; Mr. B. Gill in the chair. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in l7e Times, was taken as read. The CHAIRMAN, in moVing the adoption of the report, said be would make a few remarks on the present position of the company. These were times in which, if persons were not doubting themselves, they wore inclined to doabt others, and therefore it was necessarv to give full expla nations. Instead of their shares having been isaued at a I discount, as many shares in English railways had, they were issued at a premium, of which the shareholders generally had the benefit, and also the full value for their outlay. On looking over tho list of dividends they had paid he found the first two dividends were at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum; the next three half-yearly dividends were at the rate of 8 per oent. per annum; the last half- year at the rate of 9 per cent. per annum ; and the present i dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. Now, he rea11y thought this was satisfactory, and showed that it was a ond4 fide concern, particularly as they had fairly and honestly made those dividends out of the profits of the compsny. Their traffiec had been affected by the depression of trade in America, and he believed there never was so severe a crisis as that recently experienced in New York. He thought, under all the circumstances, that 6 per oent. was net so bad, particularly when the preceding dividend had been at the rate of 9 per oent., the average being 7A per cent. for the psat year. He knew of no para=el ase of a railway company having commenced with a 6 per cent. dividend, and having sustaned its returns, like the Great Western of Canad:. It had also to pay aa much as 1 pet cent. dividend towards the repayment of the Government loan. If it were not for that and the high rate of interest the dividend would hxve been at the rate of 10 per cent. for the last half-year. They could fatrly and boldly look at their ooncorn as a band fide one. With regard to the future, agreements had been entered into for the protection of their property. Something like a half er cent. of their stock was held in Caijada, and,the remaider, 994 per cent., in England, together with the enti of their bonds - it was therefore an English roperty. With the view oi protecting their interest, they had added Mr. Reynolds to the board for the purpose of attending to financial matters in Canada and relieving bMr. Bridges from that duty,ao as to let him be free to attend to the mlangement of the line and out-door businessh Mr. Reynolds was now in Canada attending to their affairs, and he thought those two gentlemen were folly competent to protect the English interests in the undertaling. They were Indebted to the exertions of Mr. Bridges for maklng an arrangensent with the Canadian Government which would allow the company to pay off the debenture debt at par in the course of two years from thelst of January next. Those debentures were now at 10 per cent. premium. They did not Intend at present to decide on any partioular plan for raising the money to pay off those debentures. In consequence of representations from some large shareholders in the company to the effect that the Detroit and Milwaukie Company had come to a dead lock, and would be unable to open their line for another year unless assted by means of a loan to complete their line the question was whether they should assist them with a loan. The Detroiu and Mllwa uke line was as long as their own, and when opened could not fail to bring them a large traffio. The directors had had several interviews with the directors of that company, and they were unanimous as to the poicy of assisting them to complete the line; but nothing lees than as mortgagees In possession would satisfy them as to the security upon which they would lend the money. The security would be ample in every respect, and by the arrngements for working the line they would have a stream of through traffic over the Great Westem whlch would be of importance to them. In many respects traffio agreements in England were not worth the paper upon which they were written, and might be broken at any time by either party, but they would make a bLnding agreement which vwould be beneficial to both partie, The Detroit line had been surveyed by to engineer andthey were of opinion the line might be opened in the beginning of next year. The directors had thought it right to gLve the shareholders an opportunity of expressing their opinion on the finncia propositions in the report, and they had responded by returning proxies signed to the extent of 40,000 votes. It would be unworthy of them, under th'e circumstances, to refuse to assist the Detroit and Mhlwaulie to the extent of 160,0001., which they required to finish and open their line, on the security he had mentioned. He would be sorry to use the proxies, as his only wish was that all the shareholders should be represented. He concluded by moving a formal resolution for the adoption of the report, the declaration of a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, accepting the offer of tfie Canadian Go. vernment for the repayment of the loan of 700,000., and authorizing the directors to lend the Detroit and Miwaukls Railway Company 130,0001. for the completion of the railway on the security of the line and rolling stock. Mr. S. HERAPrATH had no objection to the resolution, but thought it a bad precedent to lump so many things together. He suLggested that the first resolution should be confined to thoadoption of the report and the declartion of the dividend. Several other shareholders thought it would be better to mako the chairman's resolution into four resolutions. The CsiuraAN said his object was to ficilitate the business of tho meeting, and he would agree to limit the resolution as prep"sed. A PRoPRixtoR stated that if the 1 per cent. had been deducted from net revenue in the past half-year, as on all former occasions, the dividend would be 5 per cent., instead of 6 per cent., and it w&a therefore 4 per cent, less than the last dividend. The CuAsRmAw, in reply to Mr. Cox and other shareholders, stated that the 68,0001. to the credit of revenue wae in the hands of the Government, and would be taken by them as a portion of the first instalment of the loan. It was taken out of revenue, and would be returned to it, but they had to provide for claims in respect of the late accident and other matters, so they could not at present dotermine what was to be donew ith that sam- With regard to the Sarnia branch the contractor had to allow them 6 per cent. on the capital expended on it until opened for traffio. in consequence of the death of the contractor the works had been delayed; but that line would no doubt be completed by the time another line to some extent in connerlon with it came into operation. Under the vote of the proprietors the directors had power to expend 400,0001. ; there now remained 130,0001. of that sum to expend, and -when that was exhausted they would ask them for more if required. Another matter was that they had to reneo 200,0001. bonds which fell due this month; they succeeded in renewing 100,0001. at 5A per oent and they were now borrowing at 6 per cent. for short perods to make up the remainder, The report was then adopted unanimously, and a dividend rt the rate of 6 per cent. per annum for the half-year was declared on the paid-up stook of the company, The CHAiRskT± then moved a formal resolution, to the effect that the terms offered by the Canadian Government for the repayment of the 700, 0001. lent to the oompany be approved and accepted. Mr. S. HERAPATH said, as the sum of 67,86. had been originally taken from revenue for the purpose of graduaUy paying off the portion of the capital borrowed from the Go. vernment, he thought it should be applied to that purpose, and go in reduction of their capital. Ile deprecated the use of it in any way for dividend. The CnuRms.N hoped they would ill meet again next year, and that they would find the money-market more favourable than it was at present. The 67,8561. wsjperfectly secure in the hands of the Canadian Government, and nothing could be done in respect to it until they again met. Mr. BRIDGEs seconded the resolution, and It was carried unanimously. The CHAIRMAN then proposed a formal resolution authorizing the directors to lend 150,0001. to the Detroit and Milwaukie RaUiway Company for completing their line across Michigan, the expenditure being carried on under tho Great Western Railway Company. He said there ws no one more averse to extending their outlay than he, but this was a case in which It was their interest to do so. The bonds of the Milwaukle Company were now selling at a rate to give the purchasers interest at 10 per cent. per annum, aud he thought they might fairly ask them to pay that amount of interest for the loan of 150,0001. (Hear, hear.) The Mlwaulkie Company had expended ntheir line and Mr. Wythes was the oontractor. The greet object was to aecare the making of it as soon as possible, Mr. BRYDn:xS, the managing director, in seconding the motion, entered into an explanation of the recent falling off in the traffic of the Great Western line. The falling off was merely temporary, and he felt convinced that the traffic would Tery soon rise again, and in future become greater than ever it was before. The deficiency inthe traffio had arisen from the reaction caused by the partial discontinuance of the outlay of a large amount of Englsh money in Canada. Noarly all the capital, amounting to 15,000,0001., was brought from England, and expended on the railways, which caused a great demand for labour and provisions vwhich for the time had the effect of raising land and everything beyond its value. The reaction would be of great advantage, as it would check speculation, and in the course of a short time things would oome to their proper leveL They had a large local traffic on the line, and there was no portion of their throngh traffic abstracted from them. Their through trafflc had increased very nearly 10 per cent. That showed that their line was preferred to other routes, ani that it held a good geographical position. The traffic on the New York Central Railway and of the Michigan Central had faUen off coaRderbly in conseuenea of the depression of business, and of course the Great xWest- ern bad anfered from a like cause;* but he thraffic swould soon return to them. If they had no other elements to look forward to than those which might be expected to arise from the completion of the Detroit and Milwaukie Railway, it would be6ufficienttoaddsomethingoonslderable to theirdividend. The population onthatline was verylarge; there were numerous mills, and so forth, and he could see no reason why they should not have an exceUent ,traflc There were large beds of coal on the Detroit line fit for household and other purposes, and also large beds of gypsm, which would increase the loCal traffic. The line would ter. minate at the city of Milwaukie, having 50,000 inhabitants. The exports were valued at M50,000,000, and the ship ing was estimated at 30,000 tons. There were 200,000 barrels of flour manufactured in the year, which world be conveyed to the east. Various lines, amounting to 700 rnlles, now radiated from MUiwankie, and next year they would be increased ,to 2,000 miles. There was apepulation of 1,000,000 to be served along the line, and it was impossible to! say what the increase of through traffic would be, but at the lowest calculation the passenger traffio from the, Milwaukie line would be 50,0001. currency over the Great Western Railway. That would give them an increase in their dividend of 1 per cent., without taking into consideration the additional goods traffio, which would be consider. able. The security for the loan would be amnple, and they would have the control of the traffic. They would reap advantages in every way by assisting the Detroit ard Mllwaukie Company, and he believed It was the surest way of increasing their dividends, Mr. S. HIRAIPAtu hoped, If the meeting sanctionod the resolution, that they woed still bear in mind the policy laid down two years ago, whish was to keep clear of the rook, he meant the Unlimited outlay of capita, which had sunne so many simila n4dukings. It was also requisit ko them to know whether the I 0,000( would be amnply sM. cient to complete the Milwaukle line. He hoped they would not come forward on a future oocasion and y that 100,0001 more would be required, and until it wa expended the 150,0001. would be unproductive. Ho hope there would be nothing of that kind, thrt the 150,0o00. would be sufficient, and that it would not be made a preodent of in future. They should be content 'with a good thiDg, and not spend more money to make It better. Tho CHAIRMAN having laid claim to the mainteaneoo of that policy in which he had been most faithfully supported by hlr. Br3dges, The resolution was adopted. Mr. S. HBHAPATH said it was but an act of justice to Xfr. Brydges to advert to the difficult position in which ho had been placed at the Canadian board, and to acknowledge the able manner in which he had, standing alone, defended their interests in Canada. ie intended to propose a vote of thanks to him, but in doing so it was also necessary to add an expression of confidence, as statements were circulated in Canada that Mr. Brydges did not posess the confidence of the English shareholders. He concluded by moving a vote of thanks to hIr. Brydges for his past oonduct, and ex. pressng unab,ted confidence in him for the future. Mr. NG bore testimony to the zeal and ability of Mr. Brydgeff stating that he had raised the character of the company by his cx eilent management. Tne motion wars cardled unanimunoly. On the motion of Mr. LAING the retiring directors were reclocted, anda vote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings, hBUNGAY AND HARLESTON. The promoters of this propoed extension line held a second meeting at Bungay tor the purpose of receiving a report from a sub-committee appointed to receive subscriptions in Aid of the scheme. Mr. P. Bruff, hr. Kitton, the law clrk, and Mr. Ayres, the secretary of the Eatern Union Railw'ay Company, at. tended the Town 1eeve (Mr. J. B. Scott) presided. The dHAERSLAN stated that arrangements would be made by oertain local authorities to fadclite the completion of the Ine; and, having satisfied himself as to the limitation of the liability, he was ready to take some share in the undertaking. The report presented by the committee stated that the amount of tubscriptions promised was only 2,1001,, while 8,0001. was required. Mr. BRUrF decuned to state whether the scheme wonlid be abandoned and the money returned if the whole of the 8,0001 were not provided, or whether the lune would be msde so far as the subscriptions permitted. A few further additional subscriptions were promied, and the proceedings terminated. TRAFC RETURNS. Miles Pa. ies- Total, Total, EsliWays. opm enges ebandLe. 1857. US.

I,ROYMASTERS' QUARTRALY MBEETINat BIRMINGHAM THuRsDAY. The most important meeting of tho quarter was held in our Town-baU to-day; but, considering thatthe one usually held at Wolverhaupton on the previous day was, in conse. uenoe of its being the day of ' national humiliation," abandoned, the attendanoo was not so numerous as expected. Metunbereor representatives of the leading frma of 8outh Staffordshire, E;ast Woresetershire, and Shxopshire were present, but the resolution of the priminary meeting at wolverhampton having settled the nominal pricee of thel en6unig quarter, personal attendance, except in particular oases, appeared to have been deemed almost altogether un-. ne*>~~~~~~~e neomry. But,although the company in the Hall did not reach more than an Average attendance, the bnsiness transacted waM understooi to be unusually large. The demand for South Staffordshire for home consumption was remarkably steady, and settlements made with a promptitude which showed unequivocally the healthy state of tbe general iron manufacture. It was stated that one extensive firm in the neighbourhood was in possession of orders for best deccriptions of iron which would occupy the works in their execution for the next three months. The demands of the London and Liverpool honses who buy for exportation were represented to be improving, and from all we heard to-day before the close of the quarterly meetings at Dudley on Saturday evening there will be a stll' further augmentation of orders. It is unne. cesary to state to those acquainted with the iron trade that the leading orders for rails go to Wales, and those for sheets to Scotland, while for manufactured iron required for ship. building and other purposes of common usa, of the best qnslity, South Staffordshire iron is in the greatest request. T resent extraordinary demand for these qualities justi. ee he observation. Large f the par. poses to which we have referre dare now in make for export. ation, and there is apparently no cessation of demsnd It was setated in the allU to-day that tenders had been made by several of the principal firms of the district for extensive snpplies of South Staffordshire iron for London and Liverpool houses connected with the East Indian, Ameri can, and Australian trades, but that their acoeptanoe was delayed and injured by the compe3ition now existtng be. tween the London and North-Western and Great Western Railwray Companies for goods traffEo. These supplies, if con. tracted for, were Intended to be continuous for some period, but, in consequence of present low prices, the London and North-Western Company decline to enter into any contract for the conveyance and delivery of goods except from day to day at those reduced rates; and thuas great damage is done to the manufacturing interest of the neighbourhood. The ironmasters admit that the reduced tariff cannot pay the railway proprietors, and that at some day, sooner or later, there w il in all proba. bility be an advanoe upon the rates exacted previous to the reduction. There is no question that conve)-anco is no mean item in an ironmaster's contract; and as the question now stands the greatest difficulty is experiencod in coming to A satisfaotory arrangement with their London and Liverpool correspondents. All parties appear to consider that present rates can only be temporary-as existing only from day to dy-but in the meantime the future heav trade of the district is consideralWly damaged. The iromauters and merchants appear fuUy to understand how the Suestln stands, and state that the present trafflic tariff, which has been in existence now for about a month, is a great inconvenience and annoyance to the trade. Suich was the conversation in the Hall to-day; and in these opinions most of the influential ironmasters present appeared to ooncar. The reduction of charges for the conveyance of South Staffordshire manufacture-for mere competition, however ruin. ous the consequenoes-had, as they stted, already done ha rn instead of good to the vaiousff trades of the district;for under present circumstances no eontract for any length. Of time could be entered into by manulactutt and mer. chants w,ith the great railway companies. The coal trade was represented to be brisk; but of this more will be heard at the Stourbridge meeting to-morrow.

LONDON, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9 1857. Conservatism is an element of human nature, and its proper application is necessary to progress. It is only the thriftless, devil-may-care, desultory, bouseless wanderer who is really destituto of the Conservative instincts. But even he has his favourite coat, bis faithful umbrella, and his old pair of boots that will not wear out. "A rolling stone gathers " no moWs" is the first maxim of wealth. Bedouins, Scythians, Laplanders, and such people have never advand&d a step, because incessant locomotion did mot allow them to acciumulate ; and it is said that -the Esquimaux will never make a step out of barbariswn, because it is one of their funeral customs to burn at the tomb of the deceased, not only all his own property, but what they prize most of their own. Every fresh donation of blankets or axes only goes to swell the next funeral pile. As v'e advance in civilization, as our interests become larger and sentiment acquires a higher and a grander range, then we have more to keep, to treasure, and to fight for. We have property, institutions, sacred things, ideas, principles, truths, and words supposed to enshrine these things. Our ancestors have fought over and over again for their laws, their customs, their rights, -all often very imaginary; for citieg and territories of no value whatever; sometimes for a liberty, sometimes for a crown; for a holy place, for a point of honour, for anything to fight for; but always under the impression that victory was a step won or a position secured. Indeed, strange to say, though progress is more moving and active in name, the greatest efforts, perhaps the most forward movements, have been done on the pretence of keeping what we had and remaining what we were. There must be Conservatisni and there must be Conservatives, and we must all b- conservative in one wvay or another. The difficulty is to find a worthy object, or a safe object, even a harmless one, for Conservatism on the grand, national, political scale. Rotten boroughs and corporations, obsolete Acts and empty forms, were not worth their salt, and it was a waste of powder and shot to fight for them. So were Deans and Chapters who did nothiDg; Bishops without clergy, and clergy without flocks; Colleges without students, and all sorts of reverend hulks lying in ordinary. We now respectfully, but confidently, submit that the Corn Laws were not worth the amnount of Conservatism lavishIed upon them. Yet the fault was not in the feeling ; it was in the object. It was simply a case of unworthy attachment. The proper remedy would have been to find a worthy substitute,-something that could be loved with advantage and honour; something worth living for and dying for. But PEBL had not the tact or the invention for that. He simply set to work to outwit and befool the Conservativeis into the surrender of their new hobby by fair means or by foul, and then found, too late, that the instinct which he had helped to foster was too strong for him. To take a simple figure, he had given the dog a bone, and could not get the dog to drop it. From the proceedings of the Essex Conservative Demonstration in our columns to-day we are inclined to hope that some of these gentlemen are on the look out for objects more worthy of their attention. Though they will not commit themselves to a " dark horse," as one of them styles Lord PALMERSTON'S Reform Bill, and though they do not appear to like Lord JoHN RussmL's plan, any more than MIr. Looxs KING's and some others, yet they are not obstinately bent on maintaining our present electoral system. Indeed, by their own showing, they have mighty little reason for doing so. Nor is there any other home institution just now suffli. ciently important and sufficiently threatened to call for the zeal of the crusader in its defence; so India promises to engage all this mass of uninformed, unimproved, misdirected patriotism. Nobody has yet spoken better about India than Major BERXSiOoRD on Tuesday at that old haunt of Protectionist platitudes, the Bell Inn, Castle Hedingham. We are quite sure the gallant orator spoke as he felt, and as he would certainly have acted, when he said that, but for ten years too much in his constitution, he would have gone out to India to fight and spare not. We agree with him entirely in the view which he takea of the nation's unpreparedness, the causes of that misfortune, Lord PAL.uERSTON'S first error, if error it was, and the manner in which he has retrieved it. He speaks, too, from his heart, and will fulfil what he says, when he promises "that he will be no party to "hampering a Government which is doing every"thing in its power to maintain the honour of "the country." That is the universal feeling on British soil and in hearts that remain British; and they must have been strangely transformed who can listen to the bitterest enemies of their country traducing its warriors and its cause, and praying for its downfall. Nor do we think this appeal to the Conservatives likely to be an idle one. We have a great work to do in India, and it cannot be disguised that we have to make up with energy, with determination, with skill, and with money for our present want of men. This is the old fashion of England. She has always fought against odds, and, no doubt, always will. Every year, every month, it is true, wiU mend matters; but when we have had to reduce the standard and double our MIilitia called out we show our resolution, but betray our weakness. It has, however, always been found, and always will be found, that England eventually finds men for any really popular war. In truth, we represent our old Saxon, Danish, and Norman ancestors, and are as military as commercial. The charge that we are a nation of shopkeepers is as great a mistake as that of the courtiers who took UTLYSSsE for a travelling merchant, and were speedily undeceived. WVe are all warriors at heart, and any hour it will only cost a slight change of measures to divert all the heart, soul, mind, and body of our people from peace to war. A certain amount of sacrifice, of course, will be necessary. We cannot become all at once a nation of soldiers without resigning to military prowess in its lowest as well as its highest forms a larger share of honours and rewards; but, if that be necessary, no class, or rank, or faction will be found to grudge this sacrifice. Major BERESFORD adopts very warmly the opinion that it will be necessary to mark with the most telling and memorable chastisements our sense of the crimes conumitted by the Indian mutineers. There are those who protest against such measures on the ground of Christian charity, or the folly of a warfare upon innocent buildings, or the inconveniience of destroying cities which we may want for our own uses. That there may be some force in these objections, and that, if possible, they should be considered, we readily admit. It is not very likely, indeed, that the question will ever come before public opinion in this country, except for approval on deeds already done. For that matter, we certainly shall not attempt to mar the triumph of order, truth, and humanity itself by any strictures on the proceedings of our justly enraged soldiery, or the more solemn acts of those in command. Should the question subsequently arise, " hat-is to be done 4" with Delhi 1" in cold blood, we beg to submit that both justice and policy sanction the utter destruction of those monuments which have helped to make Delhi the natural focus of mutiny, and which have been now associated -with the grossest insults to our country, our women, and our faith. These things belong to the Mahomedan dynasty which has been revived against us, with its abominable cruelties, the odious intolerance of its creed, and its utter enmiity to the whole human race. Ever sine we became masters of Agra and Delhi we have been warned that we should one day rue bitterly the preservation of buildings which would always wage a silent war against our rule and our faith. Of course, the Indian Government aggravated the evil by keeping up the KiL'w, the Court, the forms! of empire, and an immense revenue, that could only be spent in vice and intrigue. On the other hand, we expect that an earnest intercession will be made for edifices of almost unparalleled beauty, and against acts which we are told will class us with Huns, Vandals, an-i the Reformers of the English Church, all of whom adopted the policy of destroying the newts as well as the birds. It is possible, too, we will admit, that other methods may be devised to stamp for ever on the Indian mind the sense of the civilized world on these abominable deeds. If any such means can be auggested,-if the object can be attained without the sacrifice of a well-built city and magnificent edifices, and without putting the unarmed inhabitants to the inconvenience of finding shelter elsewhere,-then we have only to say the object is attained, and we desire no more. But we do entirely concur in all that Major BSESFORD says on the perfect lawfulness of such retributions, their salutary force, and the sacred precedents in support of them. We do not believe that any city in sacred or profane history ever witnessed such atrocitiea as were publicly done at Delhi, Jhansi, Cawnpore, and some other places. As to the first place, we hold it utterly forfeited to the cause of humanity, and due to the flames. If it be spared it must be for special reasons, and we are far from denying that reasons may be shown; but they who would avert the destruction of the city and its too speaking monuments are bound to tell us in what other way we are to make Asia learn, know, and remember for ever not to commit these deeds of foulness; and that, at all events, Englihmen will not permit them to be done without exacting terrible retribution.
The religious aspect of the Indian crisis will present itself with peculiar force to the publio mind after the solemnities which were observed on Wednesday, and which we recorded yesterday moning. It in Imposible to eliminate this element from the question. Assuming E,bat the revolt originated in Mahomedan machinations, and that the motives animating the leaders of the mutiny are traceable to the ordinary instiDncts of cupidity and ambition, it seems, nevertheless, incontestable that religious panic must have operated as an immediate agent in the catastrophe. Hindoos, though not averse from doctrinal controversies or free speculation, entertaiu a mortal apprehension of compulsory conversion, and appear always ready to suspect us of designs upon their faith, and to act upon their suspicions. Aow are we to encounter such extravagant sensibilities and jealousies ? We know our own innocence in the matter. We feel that we are far better prepared to prove the reality of our past indifference than to defend our behaviour as Christian governors. We never dreamt of bringing the natives of India to a knowledge of the truth by force, or persecution, or artifice-scarcely even by any other methods; but, if we have not been successful in opening their eyes to the fact, what is to be done ? In connexion with this inquiry we now ask the attention of our readers to two remarkable points. It is not a little singular that though the Hindoos have lived for ages past under the administration of conquerors, we appear to have been the only rulers whose Government has been exposed to these extraordinary difficulties. Not only was the whole of India consolidated, at any rate nominaUy, into a Mahomedan empire, but a dozen or more Mahomedan despots, each in his own principality, exerted absolute authority over the lives and fortunes of their respective subjects. Some of their successors, indeed, continue in the enjoyment of the same prerogatives to the present day, and there is scarcely any quarter of Jndia in which Mussulman dynasties have not been established for longer or shorter periods- We need hardly stop to add that the religion of MAHOrsT is utterly antago- I nistic to that of thelHindoos, that forcibleproselytism is one of its tenets, that the obligation is recog. nized by true believers, and that by some of the Princes referred to-notably by TIPPoo SULTANit was unscrupulously put in practice. Yet we do not hear that any of these Governments existed by the frail tenure of sufferance accepted by ourselves, or that monstrous explosiona of irrational fanaticism were among the contingencies to which they were liable. As far as we could discern, the throne of the Mussulman Nabob seemed as solidly established as that of the Hindoo Rajah. Even the Mahratta power itself did not occasion us more trouble than the arms of Tirroo, and the removal of a Mahomedan tyrant from Lucknow the other day is actually alleged as an Indian grievance. Clearly, therefore, it is quite possible for Governments professing a religion opposed to Brahminism, and acting on their professions, to axercise authority over Hindoo subjects, not only without offence, but even with a considerable degree of popularity. Hindoos, in fact, have always been ruled by foreign conquerors during the known periods of their history; have often been persecuted on account of their religion, but have never been thus driven to insurrection, except against the British, who entertained no idea of persecuting them at all. The next point to which we invite attention is this,-that, whatever may be the .ensitivenesi attributable in these matters to the genuine Elindoo, it never appears to display itself overtly except when the said native is provided with arms, drilled to the use of them, and turned into a soldier. If the policy of the British Government had been really calculated to terrify believers in Brahminism, the alarm and its consequences ought to have been visible, not alone in the Sepoy ranks, but among all classes of the population. The Bengal Army was certainly a very numerous body, but even its 150,000 men represented but a fraction of the inhabitants of Hlindostan. It is perfectly plain, however, that the Hindoos, as a body, are passive, that they profess no alarm for their religion, and that of the two they are disposed to side with us rather than with our enemies. What might be the effect on the native mind of any prolongation of this conflict nobody can pretend to foretell, but up to this time the general allegiance of the population to the British Government has been indisputably shown. We find, therefore, t.hat there is not enough in Brahminism alone to make a man dangeously distrustful of his rulers. Other conditions are required to develope the frenzy in question, and these are tbat he should be of the military profession, and belong to an armed, organized, and disciplined body. Insurrection, in short, or a rising of the people, as such, is a thing extremely uncommon in India, and highly impro- I bable ; but UGtin1y, or a revolt of sol(liers against their employers, has occurred frequently, and was likely at any moment to happen. Here, then, we get the case in a plain and intelligible form. The Affghan and Mogul Emperors were exempt from troubles on this score because they did not place their reliance upon a Hindoo army. The Mahomedans in India were strong enough of themselves t- maintain Mahomedan ascendancy, and T1rPoo SULTAN could persecute Hindoos as he pleased, because there was no Eindoo force iR his dominions sufficiently powerful to lay down the law for him. By observing the same principles we can render our own government equally secure. We do not deny that the alarm of the Sepoy for his creed may in some degree be genuine, but the passion of which we now see the results is manifestly compounded of two sentiments. It may spring from the influence of panic, but it depeonds for its vitality on the possession of power. The Sepoy rebelled, not simply because he feared for his caste, but because he was one of lOO,0oo armed men, and there appeared no force in the empire greater than that of which lie formed a part. Anxiety for religious freedom only became an explosive feeling when it was allied with the contagion of professional brotherhood and the consciousnesa of military strength. Barbaric armies have always been fornidable instruments, and prone to the expression of abrupt, lawless, and irrational passions. In India jealousy of religious intervention on the part of Government i, undoubtedly a passion of this description, and it is expressed accordingly by the Indian Army; but in reality the Sepoys have repeatedly mutinied, or threatened to mutiny, on other and totally different grounds. They knew that, as Europeans were few, and they were mnany, our policy was one of conciliation, and they aWted upon this knowledge. The only justification fur the incredulity of the Indian Government in this matter is, that Sepoy mutinies were every day occurrences, and there was no iiunediate reason for concluding that this one would be worse than others. Two courses may now be described as open to us -the adoption of a more perfect, absolute, ahd invariable policy of concession-such a policy as would leave even a Sepoy army nothing to complain of, or the establishment of our Government on such a foundation as will enable it to discard sufferance and rule by strength. For the latter of these we unhesitatingly pronounce, and on these ainple grounds,-that we regard the former as purely impossible. Constituted as Hindoos are -open as they are to the arts of mendacious agitators, we do not believe that any amount of truckling conciliation or surrender would save us from the eruption of these periodical panica. To escape suspicion for ever would be out of the po wer of any Government. In fact, the Company's servants themselves, with all their obSeqiouMness, were unable to do so; and the adoption of such a policy has this permanent and serious disadvantage, that, though it is impotent for pacification, it is all-powerful in the encouragement of the very spirit which is dreaded. Setting aside for the present any higher obligations, we must needs rule by strength, for we cannot rule by bargain. No efforts on our part, no suppression of our own creed or oblivion of our own duties, can insure us against these explosiODs of groundless distrust. Our only policy is to extinguish the element which renders these jealousies fatal, and to take care for the future that, though there may still be Elindoo panics, they shall not find expression through an overbearing Hindoo army. Mutiny is the only form of insurrection we have to fear, and there can be no formidable mutiny where there are no formidable soldiers. It avails nothing to argue about our disproportion of numbers. The balance must be struck, not between Europeans and natives, but between Europeans and Sepays, and we have learnt during the last ihree months that that balance can be trimmed without any impracticable tax on the resouroes of Britain.
The doings of this age are certainly not such as to discourage those who believe in the approach of human nature to perfection. In spite of obstacles and reverses the world is advancing in the career. of improvement, and, though we cannot hope that it will ever become completely good, there is no doubt that it is yearly growing better and better. By the wonderful law of progress the crimes of individuals and the calamities of fortune tend to the amelioration of manlkind. The ambition of the Emperor NICHOLAS has led to the final settlement of Europe andthe dispersion of the dark cloud which hung over its people. The outbreak of Mussulman and Hindoo fanaticism in India will be the means of subjecting that country more completely to British power, and of sweeping away the prejudices and timidity which made us refrain from the work of civilization. Similarly, the convulsions which have shaken Europe during the last 10 years have caused even the least enlightened nations to think of their social condition, and the most despotic rulers to dread isolation from the community of States. One of the strangest examples of the desire to be sheltered under the togis of civilization is to be found in the grant of a Constitution by the Bey of Tu.%is to his subjecta, of all races and religions. What dreamer of Utopias, what preacher of universal liberty, could have looked forward a generation since to such an event ? It could never have entered the brain of the most enthusiastMc Radical among us. The wildest theorist of the "Extreme Left" across the Channel would have failed to entertain it. The principalities of the African coast have been for ages connected, in European minds, with despotism and cruelty in their worst forms. Salee rovers were the terror of our great-grandfathers; Algerine pirates continued their depredations until the conquest of the country a quarter of a century ago. Tunis and Tripoli, though less noted for lawless exploits at sea, equalled their neighbours in barbarity at home, and kept numbers of Christian slaves in the vilest bondage. But the tide of eventa has brought clvilization even to these shores. Some time since we laid before our readers a treaty concluded between the Emperor of Moiocuo and the British Government, and spoke of it as marking an era in the history of this outlying Mahomedan State. Now the Bey of TuNis goes beyond the example of the potentate of Fez, and grants a system of laws to his subjects couched in the most exact terms, and promulgated with every form of soBomnity We cannot but see with satisfaction such an approach to the spirit of European Government. It will, of course, be objected that constitutions are good for little unless there exist the honesty and ability to work them, and we may be reminded that where Europe has failed Africa is hardly likely to succeed. But the world is here concerned not so much with the working as the plan, not so much with the details as the principle. Even should the proposed reforms never be carried out, should liberty of worship be infringed by every mob and justice violated by every Cadi, yet MOHn.&seD BASIA Bzv's constitution would not have been promulgated in vain. If no performance follow, yet the intention itself is a victory, and the acceptance of just principles of government will prove to have given a fatal blow to the traditions of savage rule. The position of Tunis has been for many years a matter of interest to European politicians. During the long age of woalkness and coufusion through which the Turkish Empire passed the whole African coast from the Isthmus to the frontiers of AMorocco became virtually independent, not through any energy of the Viceroys, but through the total exhaustion and decay of the central power. As the SULTAN could not deter the Barbary pirates from plunder, each nation deemed itself entitled to consider the whole region as_ beyond his authority, and neither the United States nor England thought of appealing to Constantinople when they vindicated their rights by an armed force. When the Turkish naval power was finally crushed at Navarino the SUTTAN's control over these distant dependencies seemed annihilated with it, and the next act in the drama was the occupation of the who'e Algerine coast by a French army. For years after thia the fate of the African Vico- royalties was in the balance. Egypt was in full rebellion under MEuxmia ALI and his son, and it was only preserved to the SULTAN by the armed interference of England, and by the treaty to which the English Cabinet prevailed on three of the other Powers to agree. But, though the Egyptian ruler was brought under control, the Bey of TuNIs was by no means willing to recognize rights of suzerainty which had been so long in abeyance. Ile wished to be acknowledged- a ain independent Prince, and in this policy he was supported by the late King Louns PRIUMPPE, who had formerly backed the pretensions of M.nEnsFay Aui. The firinness of the present Premier, however, thwarted the BrY's ambition. Lord PALmZSToif would never acknowledge hMs independence, and even refused, we believe, to aliuw a Tunisian Prince to approach the ,ritish Court without the introduction of the Ottoman Abassador. Th.e benefits of this policy are now apparent, and will probably be acknowledged not only by the present French Government but even by the BEY himself. Tunis, instead of being a weak, decaying, and defencelems State, the prey of any European nation which should pick a quarrel with it, is now recognized as a part of the Ottoman Empire, with all the guarantees for its independence and integrity which the inmnediate dominions of the SuTL poesas. Happily, the BEY did not wait for the successful issue of the conftict with Russia before he accepted to the full his position as a vaual of the PoBTB. The Tunisian troops were among the first to arrive at the theatre of war, and they played their part with credit in the long campaign which followed. These events prepare us for the stop which the BZy has now taken. The Tunisian ruler has had aseries of warnings,-against outrages on European nations, for he knows the fate of Algiers; against opposition to his Sovereign, for he has the example of MmrEr Ani before his eyes. He is also aware of the determination of Europe to support the SuLTAn, and of the strength which Turkey has obtained by conceding to civilized Europe I what it was entitled to demand. Under these circumstances it cannot be wondered at that he should resolve to copy closely the reforms of the PoaTZ, and thus make good his claims to similar support and good will. With the assistance of the English and French ConsulsGoneral a document has been drawn up, whicb, for want of a better name, we may call a constitution, but which is, of course, only a declaration of fundamental laws similar to those lately promulgated at Constantinople. The BEY cites "the Chief of Islamism" and the great European Sovereigns as examples of rulers giving their subjects eomplete guarantees of liberty. We then declares that criminal and civil tribunals willbeestablished, presidedoverby trustworthy men. TheMahomedan religious law will be administered to Mahomedans, but Christians and Jews will obtain some modifications to suit their severalcreeds. The great principles of government will be, for the future, complete security to all subjects and sojourners withoutdistinction of religion orraceo. Taxes will be levied on all, according to their properties. Then follows the important annouucement that Mussulmans and men of other religions shall be equal in every respect. The Jews. are to suffer no persecution on account of their religion, and their synagogues are to be respected. The army is to be supplied by conscription, according to lot, and the service is to be for a limited term of years. When a Jew is tried for any offence there are to be Jewish assessorst to the court. Mixed commercial tribunals of Mahomedans and Europeans are to be established, as in Turkey. All ;'asses shall have the same right of trading, privileges are abolished, and the Government discontinues the practice of engaging in commerce. Then come two important concessions, which will, no doubt, be made use of by those to whom they open advantages. Foreigners are to have the right of exercising any kind of trade or industry, and also the right of poseessing landed property in the country. Such are the chief of the new reforms. How far they will be carried out we do not pretend to say, but, as there is nothing wild about them, and they are for the most part framed after the model of the SULTAN's late edict, It would seem that there is a fair chance of success. But, whatever faults and ignorance may hereafter mar them, there cau be no doubt that their promulgation gives a new security to the Tenisian Viceroyalty. It is desirable for the peace of the world that both shores of the Mediterranean should be brought fully into the European system, and in the late ceremony at Tunis we Bee in part the accompliabment of the object.

PROMOTION FROM TIHE RANKS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-" One who has Studied the Subject" made in your columns a few days since several very valuable suiggestions towards rendering our military service more popular with the bulk of the population than it now is. One sugaestion was that onethird of the commissions falling vacant from the casualties of war should henceforward be distributed among such candidates from the ranks as had proved by their conduct and their educational acquirements that they were fitted to bear them. if, Sir, your correspondent had studied the subject a little more deeply, he would have been aware that such a half measure would be no boon whatever to the soldier so promoted in conseauence of the present condition of officers pay and promotion in the British army. We have been told over and over again by the highest military authorities that a commission is, under our present system of purchase, rather a disadvautage than otherwise to a deserving non-comnmissioned officer, a subaltern's pay being insufficient for his subsistence; and when the emergency which has procured him this questionable recognition ef his military merit has passed awvay, and the country has returned to a state of peace, what is his fate? His promotion instantly stagnates, and the bravest and best soldier that fought in the Crimea, or is fighting at the present moment under Havelock on the Ganges, will, if without money, have to endure the daily mortification of seeing boys I.uying over his head who have never seen a sabre gleam or heard a shot fired in earnest, until he finally retires from the service a superannuated and disappointed man. So works the purchase system, gainsay it who can. J. 0.

T.BB BIRKBNHEEAD STABBING CASE. The inquest on the body of tbe nfAortunate man Drury, who was kiled under circumstances stated in She Times of Wedneschy, was reopened yesterday, but had not closed when our paroel was deBawtchd. The other wounded man (John Dunn) has mide the following deposition:I live at the dock cottages at block A. I was at Seward's publichouse on Sunday evening. There were some of Mesrs. Thompson's drivers there; there were several of them. I left at about 10 o'clock. I can't say if the prisoners were there. I know them by sight, but I don't remem. ber either of them being there, I know the prisoner John Smith well, I had got a little way towards my lodgings in the dook cottages when I saw two or three men running into oDe of the xvenues of the dock cottages& I went up to them and saw about four men striking one another, They all ap. peared to be striking each other. One of them was down. lhe man who was down lay quite still, but I saw no blood. Two of the men were inside a doorvay, and one outside. They were all fighting together. Those three men were part of the four I irst saw. The two inside were fighting with the man outside. The man I first saw was stiUl lying near tho doorway. I went up to the door to see what was the matter. When I got near, one of the two men inside the doorway rushed at me and struck me a blow on the left side, as I thought, with his fist, I then went away out of the avenue and felt the blood coming. I then met polioe-constablo Clarke and another policeman. I told him thlt I hsd been stahbbed. I saw the face of the man who stabbed me, but not sAfficiently to enable me to know him again. He had vwhite trowsers on, and I think something of a dark jacket. I cannot teU what he had on his head, I cannot say what kind of a man the other man was. I saw no more of the row, and was brought to the hospital I do not know a man named John Drury (the deceased), I may know him, but not by name. There was no quarrel at the publichouse when I left, and I believe they were clearing out. I recollect telling the policeman I would show him the house where the men were when I was stabbed. Before I left, to be brought to the hospital, I pointed, for the police, down the avenue in the direction of the honse where I was stabbed, when one of the policemen went iu that direction and the other remained with me. I cannot toU how many doors down it was where I was stabbed, When I come out of the publichouse I turned to the right, and I do not know whioh block it was in which I heard the noise, but as I went into the avenue the row was on the right-hand side. I do not know how many doors it vas in the avenue, but I had passed a corner. When I met the police-constable I was onx the road from the church to Seacombe, (BY ELECTRIC AND INTERINATIoNAL TELitc.RArI'.) The coroner's inquiry inio the charge against Francis and John Smith and George Callaghan, for the murder of John Drury, closed last night at 9 o'clock. The verdict was "1 Manslaughter" against the three.
RECRUITING. TO THE EDITOR OF TE[FTIM-ES. Sir, -I am very glad that your correspondent " W. H. RH" has called publio attention to the exorbitant lies propagated by the recruitind sergeants Ls to the benefits likely to be attained by enlisting. I read the placard to which he alludes ; I read it itusi ke the iron gates of the Horse Guards,where a taU Life Guardsman marching to and fro before it with his sword drawn gives it an official character in the eyes of the gazing crowd. " W. H. R." has not done toll justice to its mendaCty. It states that as in India the price of provisions is merely nominal the soldier receives the whole of his pay as pocket money; that ailmost every private soldier has a native ser. vant to attend upon him; that, on the march, palauquins are in readiness to carry hitm it he is weary, and that hot coffee and other refreshments are boing conqtxntly served out to cheer him ; and, finally, tbAt Her M3j-sty lestowi liberallv commissions on all pnrvate soldiers who are fi; to bear themn. 1 doubt wbether the public are such fools as the iiliJ'Ary authorities tU c' them tO be, judging from this g%cious document.

The day appointed by Royal proclatnation to be iset apart for national humiliation was observed in -the Irish capital with far ntorethan ordinary gravity rand decorum. The principal houses in the city -were closed, and the congregations in the several TProtestant churches were extremely numerous. Here and there, and at long distances, a few Roman -Catholic shopkeeDers refused to acknowledge the solemnity of the occasion bv keeping open their plaoesof busineas as usual, but all, or nearly all, the 'respectable members of that commuDion heartily joined with their fellow-citizens in paying due deference to the Queen's proclamation. TI1E BELFAST CUSTOMS FRA.ADS. The Northern' Whig, the leading commercial gournal in Belfast, referring to the recently discovered frauds of MHoore, the absconded tea merchant, observes,- "In every quarter of commercial society there is loud denunciation of the conduct of the Customs' authorities in the whole coumse of this business. Private information of what had been going on was received on Thursday evening, and an officer was sent down to Skipperstreet to watch the premises. Wloore was permitted egress and ingress to his own house, without the least attempt having been made either to investigate the condition of the contents of the stores or to communicate with the police for his arreat; and it was only when the criminal had made his escape th5t the ability of the detective officers was caUed in to repair the consequences of the scandalous neglect of the officers of Customs. That John James Moore has escaped justice for the time is only to be attributed to the fact that the Customs' authorities failed to exercise ordinary vigilance while having in their possession important information. As it is, there is a great deal of indignation expressed in certain circles In Belfast at the faflure of the attempts at Moore's -capture. It is broadly as'erted that there are parties, both in tovwn and country, wrhose reputation will beneit by 2,fooZe' succeeding in making his way safely to the United States, for 800 or 900 chests of tea have yot to be accounted for. The porter, Robb, still remains in custody, and is quite unreserved in his statemuent of Mr. Moore's proceedings. He appears to have foUowed the exAm pI of others in a better position, and to have contented himDself by sinply ' remonstrating,' to which Moore invariably replied that ho was ' hard up,' and would mnake It 'all right on the first opportunity. He thinks that Moore did not profit so extensively as Is believed by his fraudulent transactions, and that he left Belfast -with a comparatively small amount of financial means. .Another arrest was made last night. A person named Riohard Henley, in the employment of Messrs R. and J. Bell, was taken into custody under su3picion of being connected with the frauds, and was lodged in the county gaol, ander certain informations received by the police. ft is pretty clear that, if a close investigation he pursued in this case, someo astounding disclosures will be made. That Moore had accomplices, or that his proceedings were openly tolerated by a certain circle, wo have on the best of evidence no doubt; and we trust, for the mercantile chs. rcter of Belfast, an effort will be made to place before the public every naume connected with this monster fraud." B_ULLlNASLOE FAIR, The horse fair took place yesterday, and, owing to the inclement state of the weather aud other causes, it was altogether a failtre. Buyers there were in plenty, but the supply was extremely ahort, and of first-class animnals there was nearly a dearth. Nevertheless, some hunters fetched a high figure, and a few of the best were caught up by English purchasers. MIr. Murry, from Manchester, purchased a horse from IVIr. Freeman, of Cork, for something over 3001. lIe also bought a horse for His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French for 2001. fromu Sir Robert Gore Booth. Captain Ford, of the 40th lRegiment, bought a bay horse for 1051. Mr. P. Persse gave 1501. for a brown colt. Mr. Magrane got fouir horses, averaging about 1001. each. Mr. §hegog, of Monaghan, sold two horses for 1401.; and Mr. Jackson, of the samo place, a hunter for 1301). Mr. George Lowe sold a bay mare for 1201. Mr. L. Reynolds, of Dublin, purchased a horse from Lord De Freyne for 1401., aud one from MIr. Hackett, lof Birr, for 13o1.; he also gave for two carriage horses, intended for the Lord Mayor for the ensuing year, 1001. and 801 respectively. Aniimals of an inferior description were nearly altogether unsaleable. No demand for .:alliea. The numbers 'of sheep sold and unsold on Monday and Tuesday were as follows:- Sold ... ... ... . .

THIE GALE. During the whole of Tuesday night and up to a late hour yesterday evening it blew a fierce ga e from E.S.E., the storm being accomDanied by to"rents of rain. As yet there are no reports of any casualties along the seaooast, but, as the hurricane appears to have been general, fuirtlher accounts fromn the seaports are looked for with sonme apprehenisiuin The Cjirk J&oo,incr of yesterday says,- "A terrific gale from the south and eastward, accempaniod by tremendous rain, blew last night, and has continued with greait violence to-day. In the harbour a heavy SS3 ran aud some damage was donle, The hulk which forms the landing stage for the river steamers wds so knocked abuut by the heaving tide that all her gang vays 'were broken. A store hulk used by the Messrs. Scott for receivingthe cargoes of vessels was driven ashore at White. point, but we are not aware that she has sustained any serious damnage. One lighter was sunk altogetber, and somue of the yachts lying in the bight to the vest of Queenstown dragged their anchors and fouled, but without any iuI portant Jiljry to each other. This; morning the combined effects of the easterly gale aud a biah spring tide caused a flood throlugh aU tho low parts of the city, and judging from prcsent appearances there is every probabiity of a repetition of the dose."

Your Lordship is no doubt well aware of the scenes of turbulonco and riotous outbreaks which have solong prevailed in the town of Belfast. Whatever party may have been to blame for tho acts which more immediately led to these dirgraceful tunmults, it is very manifest that they have sprung fromn paity feelings, excited on occurrence of certain anniversaries which for years have been made the occasion of irritating demonstrations, too often attended by violation of the public peace, and dangerous, sometimes fatal, party cihflicts. The Orange Society ts mainly instr'mental in keeping up this excitement, and notwithstanding the proceedlings respecting that association which are now a matter of history, and in consequenie of whioh it was supposed tbat it would have been fnally dissolved, it stUil appears to remain an extensively organized body, vwith but some changes of system and rules under which it is alleged to be seoure from any legal prosecution.

I MILITARY AND NAVAL INTELLIGENOB. Two companies of tho 51st (the King's) Light Infantry ,eft Dubltn on Wednesday evening for Queenstown, to embark in the CUlcutta. The head-quarters marched next morning for Queenstown under the command of Colonel Errington, and will also embark In the Calcutta for India. Thel Cork Reporter of Wednesday gives the following account of the embarcation at that port of the two reglnents of cavalry destined to reinforeo the Army in India. " Amid the crowd of vessels of all dzes, build, and rig which lay moored in the harbour was the Great Britain, Captain Gray. Shortly after 3 o'olock one of the largest of the river stearmers rounded Whitepoint, having on board the head-quarters, band, &c., of the 17th Lancers, bound for India, and about to embark on board the Great Britain. Immediately on entering the harbour the band =truck up, ' Cheer, boys, aheer,' and 'The Girl I left behind me,' as they came alongside, amid the loud and hearty cheering of comrades on board.

UNI YRRSI!PY IA' WELLIGENCE. OXFORD. Om.^ S There was a Convocation this day at 12 o'clock, at which the Vice-Chancelor, according to annual custom, laid down his office, and an appointment was made for the ensuing year. A large number of Heads of Houses were present, and a fair sprinkling of Masters of Arts. The Senior Proctor opened tho proceedings by reading the ChanceUor's letter recommending the re-appointment of the Warden of New CoUege to the Vice-Chanoellor's offlice. Dr. Williams then rose, and in a Latin speech of more than ordinary elegance recounted the chief events of the past academical year-the deaths of Professors Hussey and Ogle, and of Dr. Foulkes, the late Principal of Jesus, the appointment of a new and worthy head to that College, on which he heartily congratulated the 'University, the resignation of I their professorsbips by Professors Claughton and Rickards, and the election in their place of Mr. M. Arnold, and Mr. C. Neate, &a. Ho said the time of the Council had besn chiefly occupied with two statutes both of great icaportance. One of these was on the subject of muiddle-class examinations, which it was proposed to corn nect with Oxford, a connexion which he belleved would be most advantageens both to the University and to the classes interested. This statute had been adopted by a large majority, and the arrangement oi the deti1t had been entrusted to a delegacy, which had already commenced its labours. The other statute, which had occupied still more time and attention, concerned the examiniations for the B,A. degree. Thbis had been rejected, but the time spent on it was not lost, since it had producedadeeperand more intimate acquaintance with the difficulties of the subject. He prooeoded to notice the in creasing disregard of all propriety of dress on the part of the undergraduates, and concluded by paying a deserved compli. ment to the late and the present Proctors. Dr. Williams then deposited the insignia of his office in the hands of the Senior Proctor, and retired from his seat ; after which hS took the oaths anew on his reappointment, resumed his seat. and nominated as Pro-Vice-ChanceUors for the ensuing year, - Dr. Plumptre, Master of University.

MUTINY IN INDIA .-THB BELIEF FUND. (I A mPQTTR~ A fl A meeting of the Inhabitants of thb borough wras held in the Town-hall on Tuesday. The chair was taken by Aldermnan Pollook. The Rev. Dr. DivrEs, the rector of Gateshead, in moving a vote of sympathy with the European sufferers, and deep abhorrence of the cruelties of the Sepoys, observed that like so many beacon fires these meetings had been held, answering aS from mountain top to mountain top to testify the deep emotion with which the heart of the whole nation was eay to leap. In fact, it might be traly said that in connexion with this object the hand of sympathy had responded to the touch of suffering from one end of the empire to another. This in reality was not a question between one dynasty and another, or between one formn of government and another; much less was it a question between one poll. tical party and another. It was a question simply of benevolenice it was not a question between Queen ictoria anid the would-be Queen of Dealhi; it was notsquestion betwen the Governor-General of India and Nana S.hb, and it was impossible to namne that sanguinary monster without exciting feelings of universal indignation and disgust. Mr. Alderman SMITH seconded the resolation, which ws carried unanimouslv. Mr. Alderman 1OsxSON proposed the names of a number of influential gentlemen to act as a comrmittee to collect subscrlptions. He said ihat this was not the time for taking into consideration the political aspect of affairs. He hop the time would soon come when a thorough inquiry would take place, and he doubted not thbt an inquiry would come from the proper quarter. But their duty to-day was a lAbour of love, to relieve the necessities of the sufferers by the revolt., Mr. BAaRAs seeonded the resolution, which was adopted. HONITON. A meeting of the inhabitants of thls town was held at the Town-hall on Tuesday, the Mayor, Xr. E. Stamp, in tl.e chair. The Rev. J'. P. A F . MACB NSS proposed the following resolutionx " That this meeting hba heard with indignation and aorrow of the mutinies in Inda, and desre to expres Its deep Sympathy with thesa who by murder and treaehery in their most fearful toms hars lost relatives and frlends, and h%Te been reduoed to chouxstanoed ot wrat and destitton." Captain BASLEIGH seconded tho motion, which WAs car ried nnanimously. The Rev. L. GIDLEY moved, and Mr. R. ABERDEIX seconded the next resolution, to the effect that the meeting desired to give practical proof of its sympathy by entenng into a subscription for the relief of the sufferers by tho mutinies In India. This motion wao also carried unanimonsly. The Mayor was then appointed treasurer, and several subscriptions were given at the meeting. FALMOUTH. A meeting of the inhabitants of this town and nel>hbouxhood, convened in compliance with a requdsition to the mayor, Mr. Samuel Blight, was held in the hall of the borough, anddpresided over by his worship} on Tuesday, f or the purpose of considering and entering into a subscription in aid of the general relief fund for British India. Several appropriate resolutions in furtherance of' the object, proposed by the Rev. Messrs. Scrivener and 'Haloonib, Captain 8aulez, R.N., and Messrs. Cane, TiUy, Rouse, Brougham, Broad, Caddy, and Rogers; wvere carriedi unanimnously, and iu accordance therewith a committee appointed to organize district collections from house to house. Contributions were at once oommenced in the hall, and when completed the amount wil he reomitted to the ceistral metropoltan fund. WARR1KGTON. A meeting, convened by the M3yor, has been held hero to aid the Relief Fund for India. A letter was read from Colonel Wilson Patten, M.P., encloeing a check for 201. 'T'he looal bank also sent a check for 501., and before the meeting separated 1501. was subscribed. In moving the first resolution, expressive of sympathy for the sufferers, Mr. Grecenall, M.P. for Warrington, said he was of opinion tbat they could not act more judiciously on the present occasion than by expressing their sympathy in a becoming, practical, and Chrstian manner. There were two things they might do. They might express their sympathy in becoming and suitable language, and, seooncly, they might show that sympathy by Christian benevolence in the shape of subecrintions. Their present duty was an immediate and urgent one, and it appeared to him to be a duty of the Government, and a duty of every good and loyal subject, to repress the mutiny, and to mintain law and order in that portion of the enmpire. Another thing which he thought the cocntry had a right to expect, and which it would demnved from our Government, was that the Government should speak plainly as to the policy they intended to pursue in the futne government of India. (HIear, hear.) That was enu important o,uestion, and one to which they would all ndiviuall and colectively give, he was sure, their strongest and closest attention. NORTH SHIELDS. A meeting of the inhabitants of North Shields w4s hold in the sown-hall on Monday evening, the Mayor presiding, to express sympathy with the sufferers by the Indian revolt, and to commence a subscription in their behalf.

SMALL MILITIA RBSGIMBNTS. - TO TIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I ama induced to trouble you with these few lines on a Fubject on which I am certain I entertain similar ideas with many other ofhcers, I have often heard it remarked, when the subject of per. manent embodiment has been mentioned, " Oh, you are too small." Now, I wrish to ask, In all fairness, why? We are governed by the census of the country we belong to, and we cannot help our size. We would be more numerous if we could and were allowed to take more recruits than the regulation allowance. But this is not all, I submit that a small corps, baving its own adjutant, surgeon, staff, and band, is a nmost disposable little force for small garrison or other duty, where a large militia or other regiment would only send a detachment not complete in any of the regimental requisites I have mentioned. Another tbing ; it is most discutragilng to those officers and men (and there are many in our ranks, who wish for pernmnent embodiment to be passed over for want of numbers.

I BRTUTAL MURDER IN ISLINGTON. Yesterday morning having been appointed for the ex. aminatlon of Thomas Robert Davis, aged 39, a oarpenter, residing at No. 11, Dorset-street, Ball's-pond, who stands cbarged with the wlllul murder of his wife, Mary DAvis, in Dorset-street, in the parish of St. Mary, Islington, by cutting her throat with a razor, the Clerkenwell police court and its avenues were a' an early hour crowded to exci s, notwithstanding the untoward state of the weather, by persons who were anxious to catch a sight of, and to hear the evidence against, the prisoner. The prisoner, who is a short, miserable-looking man, has since he has been incaroerated in the Kinpeland police station, where he has been under the care and inspection of Ia. syectorLangdon, of the N division, been very' sullen and owncast. Before he was brought to the pol le-court he was so overcome that It was round beceas&ry to give him some braudy as a stimulant. The prisoner has expressed his thanks both to the sruperintendent of the N division Mr.- Beckerson) and to Mr. Inspeotor Laugdon, of the same division, for the kind manner in which they have treated him. It would appear from the letters found at the prisoner's residence that the wife has some very respectable conuexions both in the oonnties of Dorset and Somerset and thepolice at once communicated the melancholy facts to them. Of the prisoner not much is known, except that he has lved in his present residence for nearly four years, and that he has oonstantly been ln the habit of getting drunk.- The deosased was well known as an honest, respectable person, not addicted at all to drink, and it is stated that the cause of the present lAmentable affair Is that the husband was jealous of a soldier, but without the slightest cause whate,ver. Shortly after 12 o'clock the prisoner, who seemed in a very dejected state, was placed at the bar before Mr. TYRi wssrrr, and upon the charge being read over to him by Mr. Mould, the chief clerk, he made no reply. Mr. Superintendent Beckerson and Ar. Inspector LAngdon, of the N division, were in attendance to watch the case on behalf of the Corumnssioners of Police. Mrs. Sarah Stromp was the first witness called, and said,I am married, and am the wife of John Stromp, and ve reside in the same house as the prisoner. I live on the second floor, and the prisoner and his wife lodged on the first floor front. I have resided therd about two years and a-half, but tbe prisoner resided there before I went there to live. On Thursday night last, about half-past 11, I was in bed and beard a scuffling in the prisoner's bedroom, whioh was on the first floor back. I heard him call his wife a b- -. The deceased Yeplied, "No, Davis, I have enough of you; one is quite enough for me." The prisoner then said, 'I will go and get it." I said to my husband, F or God s sake, get up; he is going to kill her." My husband got out of bed and ran downstairs as he was. I followed, as did another lodger, who resided in the next room to me. I heard the deceased call out " Murder !" three times. Mr. TYRWHITT.-Was that as you were going down. stairs ? Witncss.-No, Sir; the first ory was when my husband opened our rootm door for the purpose of going downstairs. Witness continued.-When 'we had got do-nv to the prisoner's door we found the prisoner standing close against his bedroom door. The wife was also out of the room, and staggering along the passage with her child in her arms. Mr. TYRaV}Irrr.-Wns the wife dressed ? Witness,-Yes. She and the prisoner had not beon Indoors more than ar. hour. The deceased ran out of the house with the ohild, which is four years of age. My husband took hold of the prisoner and held him, and said to him, " For God's sake, what have you done, Davis ?' The prlsoner replied, "N Now I have done itI am a happy man. A have done it for her at last. I have done for her." He then produced a razor and said, " This is what I have done It with," and he then gave it to my husband. 3Mr. TYBWssITT.-Can you give me any idea how long it was before you heard the cry of "M urder !" and saw the prisoner with a razor in his hand? Witness.-About two minutes. Mr. TYRwHITT.-JuSt explain to me how it was that you could hear so distinctly. Witness.-Because my baby was awake, and the prisoner was speakiug very loudly. Mr. TYRVWITT.-Did the prisoner appear to be sober? Witneps.-Be seemed to have had a drop, but he was not so drunk as I have seen him sometimes. Mr. TyRNm-TT.-Howr wa. the woman for drinkl Witness.-I do not think she had had a drop, Mr. TYRnVInT (to the prisoner).-Do you wish to ask this witness anything? The prisoner in a ejected tone said.-I do not recoUect seeing the witness there at alL My wife and myself had been drinking all day. Mr. John Stromp aaid,-I am tbe husband of the last wit. ness, and was in bed about 11 o'clock on Tuesday night. 1 did not hear the prisoner and his wife come home. I had bean asleep about two hours and a-half when my wife awoke me. I heard a kicking at the prisoner's door and loud screams of " Murder !" The voices were those of Mrs. Davis and her child. I got up, and, following my wife downstairs saw the prisoner standing close against his bedroorn door with a razor in his hand, which was covered with blood. I said to the prisoner, "IBob, for God's sake what have you d-ne " He replied, "I have done for her at last. Come here, Jack; I will give myself up to you. I have done the deed, and I wil die for it."1 I took hold of the prioner and said, " What,a foolish man you must have been." The razor wasin hts hand, half open and half shut. I took it from him, and he said, "T That is the tbing that hasdone-the deed." The prisoner then said, " Stand on one side a minute or two, Jack, while I go out into the back 3 ard." I said, '- No, Bob; you are in my hands, and I will not letyou go until a policeman comes up." A few minutes afterwards a polloeman arrived,and I told the policeman all ahout it, who took the prisoner into custody, when I gave him the razor, whioh was covered with blood. Wlhen . gave the prisoner into custody he asked nme to fetch PoliceEorgeant Bov* which I did. I saw the decased go down the passage bleeding from a wound in her throat. The prisoner was rather the worse for liquor. The prisoner here said,-When the witnesS saw me at the door my wife was in the bedroom. I was coming out to RCet some one to attend to her. Mrs. Sarah Ann Day said,-I am married and my husband is a sweep I live in tha same house as the prisoner. About 11 o'clock on Tuesday night I heard the prisoner and his wife come home. I heard bim ray to his wife in the passage, " You - soldiefs whore." She said, " No, Davis; do not say that. I have enough of you- I want no more." They thenwent Into the bedroom and shiut the door. I heard a grumbling, and heard him say, " Youi- whore, I will goaend fetch It." The prisoner then locked the bedroom door, and I heard him go to the front room door and burst It open. I heard the deceased say, Yon Ob-rogue, you are going to murder mne !" I then heard screams of murder tbree times from the deceased, the child also screaming at the time. I ran downLstairs, and saw the prisoner standing close to the bedroom door. He had an open razor in his hand covered wlth blood. I then aw his wiLe stagger through the passage with her child in her arms. The prisoner then said, " I am now a happy man. I have done for the - wretch. Here I stand like a man, and I do not and shall not flinch." Mrs. Mary Ann Harmon said,-I had been to the William publichonse, and on my return I opened my window, which is exactly opposite to the house in which the prisoner and his wife resided. I beard Mrs. Davis cry out "M Mlrder !" and I also heard the child say, "I ly father has killed my mother." The deceased, wvhen she ran out in the street, held up her arms and said, " Oh! my dear Mrs. llarmon!" and I said, -How can I get to you ?" The blood was pouring down her as fast as it could from a wound in her throat. By the time I had got downstairs sbo had staggered into a gentleman's arnms opposite. I took lhold of her, and, according to a gesture she made, I took her towards her own house, when she died in my arms in the street. I believe the prisoner was drunk. She was about 35 years of age. Mr. James Williamson said, -I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and of the liall, and reside at 6, Mildmay.place, Ball's-pond. On Tuesday night, abont halfpast 11, I was sent for, and saw the deceased iying on the pavement in Dorset-street. She was dead at the time, bhti wavs quite warm. I examined the throat, whioh had a pooket.- handkerchief tied round it. I found a wound extending from the end of theright side to the large muscles on the left side. The wound was the deepest on the left side. It had divided the superficial jugular veins on both sides, and the deep one on the left side. The windpipe was also deeply cut, and, in fact, it was cut nearly through . The wound woitld account for the death of the deceased. There was a great loss of blood. Mlr. TYRWHITr.- WAS the wound you saw in the neck such an one as might have been inflicted with a razor ? blr. Davidson.-Yes, most decidedly. Mr. TyRwsfm.-There was nothing that could be done for the deceawed ? Witness.-No; she was quite dead. Police-Constable James Haliday, 518 N, said,-I beard cries of" MIurder !" and " Police!" and upon running down Dorset street I saw the deceased on the ground, bleeding. I received the prisoner into custody. He made no observation either then or afterwards. Police-Sergeant Henry Bovis, 1 N-.-I beard cries of "Murder ." and "Police !" and about three minutes afterwards I arrived on the spot. When I got there the pri. soner sent three tinies to see me. W'hen I first went i.to him in the room, he said, " Well, sergeant, shake haunds with me," which I at once did. le cailed ise in a secoa time.1 an -agan cke me to shk hads anda second timue. antl again asked rne to sbakehns n,e I before, I did so. He called me in a third time, aiild ,aid, | "Well, sergeant^wbat am I charged with ?" I replied, "With the wilful murder of your wife." As he was about to speak i to me upon the matter I caut-oned hium, and told him that what he was about to say I should take down in 'riting, and might use it against him. The prisoner then caid, "I wish I was far away in India to kill soue of the b- brutes: sergeant, I wish for you to take charge of every. thing I have got, for I shaU want it for counsel to defend me. He then pointed to a workbox, and told me to take careof his certificate of marriage. On bis way to the station-house he a-ked me if his wife was dead. 1 replied, * Yes !" when he said, " Ab, it waa a had job ;" a!ud when I had again cautioned him he added, '-ell, it cannot be helped now; it was all done in a minuxlte." 3mr. TYiwuIinmT.-Did you consider the prisoner was drunk? Witnems.-I sbould say be wac decidedly drunk. Inspector Iangdon, of the N division. Paid,- On Wednesday nor.lng, about ten ii,lnutes to 1. I entered the KingsI-nd poHce-station. The prisoner, who was iitoie of the cells, called to me, and said, "1 Mr. Largdon, I want to speak to you." I went to hini, and, fiuding him the worie for liqor, said, "Davis you are not in a fit state to say anything to me ; go and lie down, for I decline to listen to yvD." About balf-past S the same morning after tle prisoner hadbesntobleep, hecalledtoiteagain. When hebegan to speak- to mne I oautioned him as to what he should say when he said he was tbanikful, lIe then said that he and his wife had been out aU day, that he had taken horme nnie work to Peckh4m ; and that be and his wife bad been very comfortable together. After be had gone home he went out to get some beer anid rmiii, and some beef Lr their suppers ; and added, *- Mr. Langdon, if you go to my house you will find what I say correct, fo- I bad not timne t drink the beer." Be then asked if his wife was | dead, and when I told bim she was he ex.clairoed, " Good nod ! a better wife never walked English ground. It wan done momentarily, but I did not do it, I liked her too well o serve her like that." On their way that morning to tho lice-court, in a cab, the prisoner said " Well, it is a very M job, but I can asaur you that I did not do it." Mr. TYnwHTT, this being the whole of the evidenoo, asked the prisoner if he had anything to say, at the same time informing him that anything he might say would be taken down in writing, and might be ueod againat him at hls trial. Theprisoner. who eemed in a very dejeoted state, and who had been sested during the examination of the several witnesses, rose and said, " I shall zmerve my defence for aniother plaoe.' Mr. TYvwnirr, in committing the prisoner to Newgxte for trial for the wilful murder of his wife, complimented the police upon the Way in which they had cautioned the prisoner previous to taking his statements. The prisoner, wrhen he was leaving the dock, turned round with tra in his eyes aisd asked to be permitted to see his dear ohild,-a request which was at onoe acceded to.
OHBTSTIANITY IN INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I must again beg the favour of a brief space In your columns to reply to Colonel Syke's letter In your isse of the 6th inst., and to answer bis cal for my name. Entertaining, as I honestly do, the views, whether rlght or wrong, eapressed under my signature of " An Anglo-Indian not of the old school," and having always openly adrocated them, I can have no possible objection to attach my name to them; and, as the Colonel seemsto doubt if they axe the result of much experience, I add that they are drawn from an official life commenced in 1816 and closed in 1855. In calling for my name as due to himself Colonel Sy'kes overlooks the oiroumstance that I was not discussing the question of our future policy in India with him, but answering your correspondent " P. ;" and I Introduced his name aolely becauae he, as I concladed from his former letter, endorsed And supported " P.'s" views and advocacy of our perseverance in the traditionary policy. As I fizd that I am mistaken in this, I gladly offer him my apology for this error in my owrn name. But to turn to his present letter. I radiy accept the issue he has raised, though I oan do no more than just glance at the subjoct, which would require, as " P." said, a volume, rather than a few paragraphs, for its just discussion. Colonel Sykes denies my assertion, that under the traditionary policy of alleged neutrality there has been a negation of our Christianity in India. I submit the following facts, falling within the period of my official life, in proof of my assertion:- First, let us take the fact of the expulsion, under the immediate orders of the Governor-General, from the Bengal army, of one of its non-commissiored ofBEcers, a man of good birth, a Brahmin, and an excellent soldier, on the sole ground that he had sought Christian baptism. I ask, was not this a disavowal and practical negation of our faith in the eyes of every Hindoo aud Mussulman in the army? Hor else could they understand it? Look, again, at the salutes from our ramparts, even on a Sunday, in honour of idolatrous and Mahometan festivals. These sounded in my ears during a long period of my residence in India. Look at the offerings presented in the name of the Government to idols; to the grants from the public treasury, in seasons of famine and drought, for idolAtrous rites to propitiate the Hindoo deities for rain; and to that whole system of support and supervision of Hindoo temples and their affairs, now happily almost abolished, and which was felt by myself and by every Christian officer required to oarry out the system u a practical disavowal of our Christianity. I must here remind Colonel Sykes that this system is even now in foroe by law, for the legislative enactments enjoining it are still unrepealed. But to pass on to some of the facts of later date. Whatever may be his view of them, I hold the present orders of the Indian Government, putting a positive prohibition on the reading of the Scriptures by heathen and Mahometan boys in every government place of education throughout India, even when such reading is perfectly optional with, and consented to, by the youth and his parents, as a disavowal of cur Chrlstian character, and that it is. and can only be viewed as a repudiation of our faith by the Hiodoo and Mahimetan world. Does he think that the Moslem would so dishonour his Koran and the Hindoo his ShAatras I I cannot pass by, also, the Court's orders of comparatively a late date, sent to the Government of India, to proclaim to every native of India that they would proscribe any one of their Christian servants who should afford pecuniary aid or countenance to missions, or to any such efforts for the enlightenment of the people. These orders, I know, were not enforced, although they were, as we are expressly t.:ld by the then Chairman of the Court, in furtherance of " the policy so long observed by our Government."a But why were they not enforced ? Let Colonel Sykes move for these orders in the House, and when they are produced, with the minute of Mr. Frederick Millet, who upon their receipt at once placed his seat in the Supreme Council In the hands of the Court of Directors, the public may judge whether there ha6 been, as I allege, a negation by the Government of our Christianity. Further, let the orders be produced interdicting any provision at the cost of Government for the Christian Instruction of the degraded tribes, Naides, of Malabar, held by the Hindoo to be so impure that none but a native Christian who had risen above caste prejudices would approach them. Let us have, also, the recent orders sent in the case of the wretched uncivilized Santhals of Bengalneither (be it observed) Hindoo or Mahometan-and contrast these orders with what has been done for the uncivilized races at the Cape, New Zealand, and elsewhere, and see whether there has not been an abnegation by our Indian Government of our Christianity. I must also remind Colonel Sykes when he appeals-as "utterly disproving" my assertion-to "the organization of bishoprics," " the building of churches," " the appointment of chaplains to every military station," that these are measures carried out and intended for the benefit of the Christian servants of the Government, and for them alone; and that the question I was discussing with " P." was not how the Indian Government had acted towards its Christian soldiers and servants, but what has been, and is to bo for the future, Its pollcy towards, and treatment of, its Hindoo and Mhaometat subjects. I cannot mee that the provision for the wants of its own civil and military European or East Indian Christian servants has any relevancy to the question at issue. That question I repeat Is this,-Is the old system of neutrality as advocated by "P.," which practicaUy donies and disavows Cbristianity in the eyes of Hindoo and Moslem, or the policy I would uphold, of an open, frank, and loyal profeasion of our own faith, with perfect justice and toleration to every individual, Mahometan and Elindoo, to be henceforth the law of India? There is but one additional point upon which I care to remark. Colonel Sykes would seem to maintain that we owe our dominion in India to the old " traditionary policy." I believe, on the contrary, that that poltcy, except so far as It carried out that just toleration which Chris. tianity itself demands, has had no more to do with the etstblishment and extension of our Indian empire than it wilt have to do with Its re-establishment by the valour of the British soldier, led by such men as Havelock, Sir H. Lawrence, and others of whom Enclad may wrll 1- J. L. THOMAS. proud. Oct. 8. Lite Member of Council, hxbru. * See Kaye's Ltfe of Tuck*r, page 562.

TH1E HuDSON'S BAY Co3mPANY.-The report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Hudson's Bay Company has appeared in the form of a bulky blue-book of souse t00 pages. The committee report their opinion that whatever may be the validity, or otberwise, of the rights claimed by the company under the charter, it is desirab)le that they should continue to enjoy the privilege of exclusive tr2do which they now possess, exoept so far As these Hrvilegws are limited by certain special recommendations (of the Felect committee). These recommendations are to the effect that it is expedient to meet tbe jost and reasonable wishes of Cauada,-that she should be enabled to annex to her own territory such lands in her vicinity as may be available to ber for the purposes of settlement, &c. The districts on the Red River and the SAs Hatchewan are among those likely to be desired for early occupation, and the committee trust that there will be no difficulty in making arrangements for the oason of these districts to Canadl. on equitable principles; and in that case the autbority of the Hlldson's Bav Coinpany within them would of course neas The eomTittee also oonsider that it will be proper, as soon as posbihle, to terminate the connexion of the company with Vancouver's Island, as the best means of favonring the dovelopment of the great niatural advantages of that important colony. l esus should also be provided for the ultimate Extension of the colony over any portion of the adjoininig continent to the west of the Rocky Mountains, In whoh permanent settlement may he found practicoble. With those exceptions, it is deemed most desirable that the company should enjoy the privilege of exclusive trade, both for the maintenanCe of law and order, and for the prevention. of the fatal effects which would probably result to the Irdians frorn an open competition iA the fur trade and the comsequent large introduction of spirituous liqnrs; and also for the preve%tion of the indiscriminate destruction of the rnore valuable far-bearing animals in the coarse of a few years.

ROYAL EA4ST BERKS AGRICULTURAL I ASSOCIA TION. MAIDENHEAD, OCT. r. The mnnual ploughing natch and exhbition. of cattlb and roots took place yesterday on Stroud Farm, near this town. The number of cattle ahown was greatly in exceas of any former year, arnd his Royal Highness carried off no less than six prizes in Class 1. Mr. Palmer, MP., and Sir Gilbert East were successful competitors with aheep, but the lambs shown by Mr. Hqnry Adams, Waltham, and to which were awarded the first ge5 vere universally prononnced to be the finest specimens that could he produced. The Ailver cup given by the Prince Consort for the best five acres of swede turnips was obtained by Mr. B&ylis, of Harley, and the silver cup of 101. value, the gift of Mr. C. P. Grenfell, wLP., was awarded to that eminent agricalturist, Mr. Joseph Hobbs, of Cookham. The Prince Consort obtained the prize for the bast palr.horse team, and also for the best 25 mangold-wurtzeL In the evening the dinner took place in the Town-hail, and as many a 150 gentlemen and farmers attended. His- - Bxcellency the Belgian Minister presided, eupported by the Hon. Colonel Hood, Xr. Vansittart, 2LP., Captain Vernon, Captain Seymour, Captain Halford, Ber. HHooper, Mr. Sawyer, a county magistrate, &c.; ;Mr. Palmer, LP., wa the vice-president. The " Health of the Queen" and other loyal toasts wero proposed and drank. His Excellency the BtiAnG AtlNzwrx then proposed "The Health of the Army and Navy." He said upon ordinary occasions he should consider it his duty to expatiate upon the qualities which distinguish the British soldier; upon his indomitable energy, his undoubted oourage, his fortitude under every trial, his manly devotion to his country and his Qnuen. (Cheers.) Bat when he reflected upon the wonderful militaxry achievements which have taken place since tha beginning of this awful Indan crisis he felt that he could nor finds words adequate to expreas the deep feeling-the solemn feeling of admiration andi respect which such glorious deeds aroused in his soul. (Cheers.) He felt that he could not do justice to the heroism of that great and good man, General Havelock (cheers),-that man who with a handful of brave warriors, as opposed to a most treacherous and barbarous enemy, had offered the noblest resistance that had ever been recorded in the military annals of say country. (Cheers.) EIis brave soldiers were not only fighting for the regalningand maintainng a power in india, they were fighting for a cause in which all free and enlighted nations were interested, and for the success of which they must all devoutly pray. (Elear, hear.) They were, indeed, fighting the battle of oivtization itself. Listen to the insolent lan. guage of the enemies of England abroad- of those vwho are the enemies of all civil and religions liberty. Already are they rejoicing upon what they call England's humiliatior ntd degradation; already are they boldly predicting the downfall of England and of that hateful constitutional Covernment. (Hear.) In the face of sucb dangers, in the presence of a crisis which it would bo childish to diminish the extent and probLble duration, they (the meeting) would, he was sure, feel and think with him that they were to testify their admiration for the English army and navy not o0ly by patric sympathetic offusions, not only by toasts sne cheers, not only by words, however eloquent or stirring, but by the strongest and rnost useful combinationt of l the possible means to increase that noble band of defenders. (Cheers.) Let them all put thaeir shoulders to the wheel h let them put their hands and heads together; let them make in a practical way to the sterling tense of the one and 'to the pound sterling of the other; let every hand that ca be spared from the field and farm be employed in wreaking veng a1oe upon the butchers of innocent people. (Cheers.) eanceforth let every one of them say to the man who complains he can find no employmnent, that he can lend a helping hand to his Christian brethren in India (hear, hear); tell the labourers that they the farmers and yeomanry would assist in sending them over; that they wtuld find at this moment the noblest employment that an Englishman could wish for-an employment in which they would reap the gratitude of their country, the admiration of a civilized world, and upon which they would as with one voice call down the blessing of God. (Cbeers.) HaLbegged to apologize for having spoken with some warmth upon the subject, but he really feltupon it asif he were struo-boor nglishman. (Cheers.) It was withthis feeling heproposed " The Health of the Army and Navy, and the Enon. Coonel Hond." (Cheers.) The Hon. Colonel HOOD said, in reply, he was proud to acknowledge their kindness in giving expression to their feelings, tesrifying how strongly they appreciated the nobla efforts of our gaUant soldiers in the East to extinguish the inostrevoltiung military mutiny that the world had ever witnessed. The atrocities committed by Nena Sahib, at Cawnpore, and by the Bengal Sepoys at other places,'were too horrible to dwell upon; but he hoped and believed that the worst was over, and that we should receive more cbeering accounts by the next mail, and that our Generals, Sir Colin Campoell, Sir Henry flavelock, and Generls NeiU and Nicholson would speedily aveDge tbose late fearful tragedies, and make the power of England felt in such a manner that both the present and future generations may vividly remember the just retaliation inthicted on their race. (Cheers.) He certainly wished that the miltia bad been called out immediately on the fir>' intelligence of the mutiny reaching this country, and that liberal bounties had been offered to volunteers to join those corps, and also that more liberal pensions were offered to tbose willing to devote their services to their couatry. If these means had been adopted he thought that we should by this time have had an army of between 3U.000 and 40,0X seady to assist their gallant countrymen in the East. (liear, hear.) And this reminded him that the gentry and farmers of that district might afford material assistance in recruiting the army of Englad by encour.glng labourers in their respective districts to enlist into the aruiy, and knov;ing, as ho (Colonel Hood) did the feeling of patriotismand loyalty that animated those hearts, he was sure they would see it to be their duty to endeavour to uphold the honour and glory of our country, and assist in retaining the present high and Pcowerful position which we as a nation now occupy. (Cheers.) Captain VmrNox, being loudly called fGr by the meeting, after a few. prliminary observat.ions, said, -Englishmea were proud ot their army, and they had reason to be so, for it was composed of volunteers and not taken by conscription from the people,-a fact which his Excellency would be well able to appreciate. It was the smallest staDding, army of any first-rate European Power, and yet it had won the narest empire in the world. (Applause.) It was recorded of Alexander that he wept for other worlds to conqUer. Engllihmen-more practical than the Macelonniaudiscovered those other worlds and mastered them. (Applause.) He had no fear as to the result of the prosent contest in India ; lie admitted it in its very vorst phase. He accepted that it was a mutiny springing out of a revolt, and. not a revolt arising out of a mutiny. Nothing could lcosen our grasp with India. No maladministration of the East India Company-if the blame rested with them-could sever from us our Indisn empire. Doubtless, the people had been misunderstood, and therefore misgoverned ; hence came it that, after a rule oetending over a century-for it was now a hundred years since Clive laid the foundation of the Indian empire by the victory of Plassey-hence was It that after a century we wet e overwhelmed with calamitles and so wide-spreading that they seemed ratber a scourging visitation than a dispensation of diLsters. How much the dethronemont of the Fing of Oude and annexation of his kingdom might have had to do withoausing or precipitating the outbreak wasyot to belearnt. It was a significant fact that these steps were immediately followed by the mutiny of every Onde Sepoy in the Bengal army, and they numbered some 60,000 nien. Now, the Oude Sepoy was a Mahomedan and cared nothing for greased cartridges. (Applaus) They were told the Government of the East India Company had been exemplary and patermaL People who were well governed did not rise against th',so whogoverned we0h Stillless was an Asiatic Eimpire aroused to outbreak without a cause, foutnded, as it was, of races various in custom, different in habits, antagonistic in. religion-alike only in their indolenoe and their readiness to kneel before any despotism. There the bastinado was administered without a groan, there tho victim of the bowstring died, making no si,n. Se doubted the policy that took the crown from the heads of moonarchs, confiscated kingdoms, brought down the landmarks of nations, and gave no nationality in return, leaving tbe waves of popula r commotion to surge and fal, hearing on its waters the wrecks of hereditary thrones. (Applause.) He thought he had a right to doubt that policy which after an exercise of a century revolted all races, from the fiery Xhomedan to the, patient Hindoo. Still he had no n isgivings as to tha result. What we had won by the sword we shuold keep by the sword. Mr. R. P.AL)ILM, M.P. replied to the toast of " The. County aemnert," and referred to the Indian mutiny. He sid, when they considered how short a time it was since, they met In different parts of the country to celehrate the termination of not a very long but certainly very expensive war with Russia. they must all feel hew painful it was that we should n'ow be caled upon to draw the swort for the maintenance of the sovereign power in the Bst, (Hear..)

FOREIGN INTBLLIGBNOB. FRANCE. [Al porIon of ttte folowing apPearod n our awond taitlorL of vederdim.-I (-ROM O01R OWN CORRMSPONDR".) FAMB, WEDIaSDAY, OCT. 7, 6 rP.M According to private intelligence from Madrid up to the night of the 3d Inst., the resignation of the Ministry had not been eecpted, but its fate was considered as sealed, and no one believed it would last until the meeting of the Cortes. The Queen and Marshal Narvaez are represented as on the very worst of terms, but nevertheless it was thought she would be content to keep him in office until the Chambers assembled, in order that he might be turned out by a vote, and not be able, on his return to Pas, to represent himself as the victim of a Palace intrgue. lThe details that I receive are of the usual nature, discreditable alike to the Minister and to the Milonarch. The Queen, wvho detests Narvaez on account of the brutal outbursts of termper he perinits himself towards her, gives the rein to her petulant wit at his expense; and he, it is reported, lately forgot himself so far as to rpeat to Her Majesty, in pure Castilian, an offensive name by which, he said, her disrespectful subjects are wont to designate her. These unseemly disagreemenb aret'ae talk o£Madrid. Itis fully confirmedto me that, as I latel informed you, the list of new senators submittedo the Queen included the name of the elder Nocedal, whose reputation stands as high as that of his son, during whose Minbitry the public voice accuses him of traffieking in places. The Queen struck her pen through the name, and said " No, it was already too much to have made the son a Minister." A letter, proceeding from a source unfriendly to Narvaez, but wihich, nevertheleas, probably tells he truth as regards the main fact, gives a new and curious version of what has taken place with reapect to the Captain-Generalcy of the ialand of Cuba. It has been repeated by various journals, and generally accepted a correct, that the Queen refused to app)oint Lerandi, and insisted on maintaining C5oncha in thatt important command. The latter partof this statement is confirmed, but the truth of its former portion is denied. Lersundi is said to have been kept out of the promised place by a cabal among his own cooleagues and Conoha to have been supported by the Queen only because she would not admit the candidate reaUy urged upon her. Thin candidate is one of Narvaez's faithful allies, a General Lahera, who was to go to Caba on the understanding that certain sleeping partners in Spain should have a share in the profits of the trade In ebony, which, of course, he would there countenance and profit by. The Queen, it is said, on Lersundi's press[nuP her, at a private audience, to accopt his resignation, and saying that he evidently did not possess her confidence, since she refused to si his appointment to Cuba, became very much agitated and disclosed the truth. Lersundi-an old Colonel of Chapelgorries, and the man who in 1848 suppressed, by his courage and decision, and almost single-handed,a dangerous military revolt-is not considered a man of talent, nor to possess much moral energy in ordinary circumstances; but he can be fierce enough when his blood is up, and as little scrupulous in his expressions as Don Ramon Narvaez himself; aud of this he In said to have given proof when next he found himself with his colleagues in council, assailing Narvaez and Pidal in no measured terms. How the quarrel was patched up we are not informed, but the Cabinet remains in a tottering state, Narvaez Insisting on his resignation being aceepted; the Queen, while detesting bim, and refusing to agree to measures he proposes, yet desirous to keep him until the Cortes assemble; Pidal, who has a mania for power, and would do anything to retain it, seeking a combination that may preserve him in his place; Seijas Lozano, the graceless Mfinister of Grace and Justice, anxious, on the other hand, to quit the sinking ship and land himself in a fat judicial berth that has just become vaoant; Lersundi, scowling at Eis faithless colleagues, and ready to head a Minfstry when they go out, though it should be but one of transition. The combinations proposed are various; some think that Narvaez and Pidal might form a new Government, but that its existence would be reckoned by days. General Larocha, a man of no mark or talent, is spoken of, like Lersundi, as the possible chief of a short-lived Cabinet, which should fill up the interval between the fall of Narvaez and the rise of Bravo Murillo. The last-named deputy Is by this time in Madrid, where he is looked upon as the coming man. In point of respectability he is certainly an improvement upon Mesr Narvaez, Nocedal, and Co. If requested to form a Government, it is not unlikely that he would in. clude in his combination his friend Beltran de Lson condition, doubtless, of his restraining his absolutist aspirations, and not seeking to go beyond his leader. O'Donnell and his friends, I am assured, would not offer opposition to a Bravo MuriMlo C7abinet. The Debaf3s of to-day has an article on the recent interviews which is here suspected of proceeding from an official source. Although the Debats raust be looked upon as an Opposition journal, that does tot, it appears, necessarily deprive it of an occa. sional connmquniV6. The foUowing paragraph constitutes the most interesting and important part of the article:- "The meeting at Weimar of the Emperors of AustrIa and Russia has surprised a great many persons; it is neverthelbes certin that It had been long preparing by the King of Prussia. The King would have liked to bring together at Berlin the three Emperors-Napoleon, Franois Joseph and Alexander; had he succeeded, it Is probable that telther the interview at Stuttgart, nor that at Welmar, 'would have taken place. The resentment of the Court of Rusea agaunst the Court of Austria was still too lively, and it is affirmed that the refusal of tho Emperor of Russia caused the faUure of the King of Prss's first projeot, although It appears that the Ring finally overcame his nephew's resistance This King Is, in fact, the uncle of the Emperor of Bussia, and, as he Is also that of the Emperor of Austria he was a natural mediator to bring about between the tw o Sovereigns a rapprocdemene which the Court of Vienna ardently desired. The first attempts of that Conrt to reestablish Its old alluuce with Russia date as far back as the end of 1856. After the solation of the diffioulties raised by the question of Bolgrad, the Vienna Cabinet had caused overtures to be made to the Cabinet of St. Petersburg, vwhich had plumply repelled them. We shall, perhaps% one day bo able to relate tho curious circumstanoes of these negotiations, of which we may believe that the Weimar interview is the result." If we adopt this account of what has passed, and it la by no means improbable or unlikely to be incorrect, we shall be disposed to admit that the recent report of a projected visit of the Emperor Nspoloon to Berlin was not without foundation, and that the tvist, although believed to have been deferred, will, perhaps, take place next spring. We already know that the Court of Berlin had exerted itself to bring about the Weimar meeting, which political reasons, besides the family ties referred to by the Dibats, concurred to make it desire; and It Is easy to understand why it should desire to bring France, and also England, into a general entente cordiale, Taking a broad view of the interests and sympathies of the great European Powers, we can hardly, I think, doubt that in case of a war breakdng out-of whioh, happUy, there is no prospect, present or remote.. and notwithstanding slight bickerings and jealousies that might exist between them, Russia,and Austria would be found leagued against Eng,land and France; while Prussia, placed between the contendng Powers, and compelled to cnoose between the camps, would be in a iituation of great difficulty. She could hardly avoid casting in her lot with Austria and Russia; on the other hand, old friendship and close family alliance with England would render her very averse to go against that Power, and her geographical position and configuration would make her territory the first battlefield, and place portions of it in imminaent periL She would have nothing to gain by war, but everything to lose, and is, therefore, of all the Powers the one most interested in the preservation of Peace. We cannot, then, be surprised that her Ing's first thought, when the late war was ended, was to do his utmost to reunite the links of amity that had been unfortuately severed. In this, so far, he has happily succeeded. We know that there has been recent evidence of a friendly feeling, and of a desire to improve it, between the Courts of Paris and Berlin. The Sovereigns have not met, but the Prince of Prumsia went to greet Napoleon-to welcome him, it may be sid, to German soil-and the attention was promptly acknowledged by a cordial letter, The two Powers that still keep most aloof from each other are France and Austria, but effort have been for some time making to remove the soreness and narrow the distance, and, notwithstanding the declamations of certain over-zealous journalists, there are no grounds for doubting that it would be agreeable to both nations to see a friendly understanding restored between their Governments. I believe the feeling throughout Europe to be in favour of peace, and coRsequently of everything that may honourably tend to its preservation. We learn that the Duke of Oporto, brother of the King of Portugal, who is a captain in the navy, and who has just been appointed to the command of a 20-gun brig, is about to visit the great naval ports of France and England, and that he will afterwards proceed to the Brazils, with a Princess of which country he in to be imited in marriage. The English and French Governments have been apprised by that of Russia that Prince Galitzin, who was sent to the Crimea to make inquiries concerning the alleged violation of the graves of British and French officers and soldiers killed before Sebastopol, has inflicted severe punishment on the offenders, and that atrong measures have been adopted to prevent a repetition of the offence. The French Govermment has made arrangements for the reception and education in the public schools of Paris of a certain number of Arab youths from Algeria who may show a dispoaition for receiving instruction. To-night's Pay3 says that the trial of the persons concerned in the late attempt at insurrection in Italy (the Pisacarne afrair) began on the 28th of September, before the Royal Court of Salerno. The Neapolitan Government, it is added, desires that the utmost publicity may be given to the proceedings, that the public may be enlightened as to what really occurred. The 3pectateur, speaking of the recent Interviews, admits that a pacific spirit premided at them, but adds that there are more positive grounds for predicting that the peace of Europe is, for some time to come, unlikely to be disturbed. Those grounds are indicated as follows - "In the firat place, the events of India, The journals which dweeU with the greatest complacency on the power f England admcit that, in order to re-esablish her rule on the Gages, she mast devote her entire resources to that war, and avoid any oomplication that might require her interven. tion on the European continent. We may therefore be asured that England will excite no fresh diffioulties, not even underthe AdminitratIon of Lord Palm-raton. Russia, on her side, requires severl years of oomplete peace to remove the traces of the wounds inflicted on her by the lut war. Peace is noessary to her, in order to construct her rairoads, to plaoe her ports beyond the reach of the mean of destruction recently invented by science,Saud to re. organize her navy and army. Tot us glanoe at the finnchl state of the continent, and we shall discover a third reaon to confide in tho oontinuance ef peace. An examintion of the money-mrkets of Paris and Vienna shows that war is impossible. We are afraid to borrow a few hundred milRons in order to consolidate our floating debt; could we borrow thousands of milions for a war? When our most prosperous rilroads are compeled to adjourn their works, who would dream of applying to credit for the purchase of powder and ball? Peace is, therefore, for the moment a necessity fer Europe. This peac will, doubtless, not be that of the Abbe de St. Pierre, and a day wll oome when war wil once more be waged,either out of jealousy ordislie, or to divert publio opinion from home politics; then wilE blood onoe more be shed and fortunes be destroyed; but this momenti is distant, and we are, for the time being, In the midst of a general armistice." I am informed that negotiations have been opened at St. Petersburg for the conclusion of a treaty of commerce between Russia and Austria. The Empre is expected here to-morrow night. The weather having become very unsettled, it is thought that she will not return to the camp, md that the presentation of the Prince Imperial to his comrades of the Guard will be postponed to another opporhtnity.

The Russians in this city glve the following account of the circumstances which led to the visit of the Empress Maria to Stuttgart :-One day, while the King of Wnrtemberg and his illustrioux guests were at dinner, the Emperor Napoleon expressed to the Emperor Alexander his sorrow that he had been deprived of the pleasure of paying his respects to the Empress of Russia. The Czar, who wa probably desirous that Her Majesty should have an opportunity of congratulating the King of Wurtemberg on his birthday (the 76th), forwarded to her by telegraph a message that she should join him at Stuttgart. It is further stated that the Empross at first demurred, but eventually agreed to go to the Wurtemberg capital if the Queen of Greece would accompany her. SSome of the members of the diplomatic body give no credit to this Russian version of the affair,anddeclare thatthe Emperorofthe French 'displayed great surprise" when it was announced to him that the Czarina wass about to make her appearance at Stuttgart. No one here knows what pased between the Emperors Alexander and Na. poleon, but a person who has very extensive connexions at the French anrd Wurtemberg Courts this morning stated that no reduction was likely to be made in the French army. The feeling of Austria towards France is by no means friendly, but still a [hint has been given to the Vienna press to abstain from any remarks which would give offence to the Emperor Napoleon, According to official advices, the Emperor Fraucis Joseph was extremely well satisfied with the reception which he met with at Weimar, but nothing relative to his conversation with his brother monarch has yet transpired. It has excited attention that the two Emperors apent several hours of the day which they passed at WVemar in shooting pheasants, but It is known here that their Majesties conversed a great deal with each other while in the Grand Ducal preserve Before the Emperor quitted Vienna he expreised a wish that nothing should find its way into the columns of the Austrian papers which could give umbrag3 to Prussia, but a writer for the Oeserchische Zeikng has paid little attention to orders, for he plainly states that " Prussia, the fifth great Power, was as little mised at Stuttgart as it waa at Weimar." To those who have no insight into what is passing behind the scenes it must appear strange that a writer for a Vienna paper should venture to act contrary to the instructions received from the authorities, but we Iwho wee how the machinery works are at no loss to understand why, and at whose instigation, the above mentioned fillip was administered to Prsia, His Majest K<ing TrderickWilliam has constltuIsA hinself the protector and champion of the Protestanfz on the continent, and he is consequently the bugbear of the Jesuit party in Austria, which alto. getherlgnores ,poltlcexpediencywheneveritWitsi purpose to do so. It Is stated thatladies of thehighest rank bad a great deal to do with the rapprochemwelt between the Courts of Russia and Austria, and there is every reason to believe that such was actuaily the cuse. That a good secret understand. ing now prevails >etween the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussla cannot well be doubted, and it is highly probable that motives of Policy alone prevented their meoting at Welmar. Pt has excited very general observation in Germany that 'the King of Prussia, who was too indisposed to go Eto Stuttgart, wau well enough to go out shooting at Mu,skau, in Prussian Silesia, on the day of the I meeting of the two Emperors at the Court of Wurtemberg. The feeling towardls England is still good here, as you will perceive by the followiug extract from the " inspired" Ost-Deutsche Post:- ' .&Power which for more than two entries we have been acenrtened to see play a great, digified, and genial part in Europe, was not diretly represented either at Stattgart or at Weimar. The great absentee was England. In spite of the sagacious combiatious of the diplomtisto the relations betweea the Europen States will be unsatlafsotory as long as England is arippled (geZah). Evory benoh (Ri4ier. Colhgium) ought to be eempoeed of an n. even number of members, but ono of the membezs of the pentarchy which Is the supreme tribunal for European affaidr is now making such prodigious exertions in Asia that its attention is dMrtvd from ERtope. The giant wbo three yeo ago hastened to suocour the sick man In the East Is now himself unwell, and lows five to be an even number."* The peroration of the Austrian publicist , that the other Powers will do well not to lose sight of the fact that England cannot fail soon to recover her health and strength. "England," saya he, "I dll not be vanquished by xuch brute (blhtien) as the Sepoys. The reconquegt of India is but a question of time, for the tenacity of the national character and the inexhaustible resources of the country have triumphed over much greater difficultles than those which now present themselves on the banks of the GsngeeY Such is the language of a paper which frequently expresses the opinions of the Austrian Foreignoffice; but British statesmen will do well to remem her that the diplomatic cards have been shuffled and that a new deal is about to take place. How Austria stands with Russia and Prussia you have learned from me; but you must look to others for information relative to the relations between those Powers and France. It may be aa well to remark that the reconciliation between the Emperors Alexander and Francis Joseph is not likely to make any change In the sentiments of the Russians towards the Austrians. They still hate them with a deadly hatred, and do not attempt to conceal their feelings. The draught of the new "lcommunar' laws is still in the hands of the Council of the Empire, but it is likely soon to be laid before the Emperor for his sancton. The new lawn will iaot be no liberal as was originally proposed, but still the restraint imposed on the ligos by the statutes of the corporate societies i be much diminished. The Minister of the Interior, who has just returned from Upper Austria, will preside at the Council of Ministers during the absence of Count BuoL Towards the end of last month His Majesty gave orders that the net revenue which had arisen from the confiscated property of the rebals In Hungary and Transylvania, up to the mnonth of July last, should be employed for the benefit of the Empire and of its inhabitants. It is stated that in future all Vienna bills discounted by the Bank must be paid by the acceptor in person. The measure would seem to indicate that the Bank suspects bills are presented bearing forged iatures The defaulter to whom allusion was made n my letter of the 3d inst. was Dr. Zugsachwert, who is (or was) a barrister and notary, and a member of the Administrative Councils of the Credit Bank and Western Railroad Company. Dr. Zugschwert has beennisaing since lOo'clock in theraorning of Friday, the 2d, and has either committed suicide or has fled, for on the, day mentioned he forwarded a letter to the principal director of the Credit Bank, begging him to do all in his power for his wife and childrenj Dr. Zugsehwert, who gambled on the Stock Exchange, borrowed large sums of money from his friendsand acquaintances, and is a defaulter to the amount of some 20,0001. or 25,000L There is no excuse for the man, for he had a lucrative practioe as a barrister, and an enormous remuneration for his services as a member of the Boards of the Credit Bank and Western Railroad Company. Another victim to the jobbing epidemic which has recently prevailed in Europe is a M ;ternikel, a cidevaxnt bookseller, who blew out his brains in the street last Friday night. Several smaU firms have failed here during the last three or four days. A detachment of Imperial Engineers is now at Krems, trying mining experiments, both with powder and with gun-cotton. The latter is said to answer perfectly well for minee, but nothing is now heard of its employment for artillery. It is credibly stated that a direct communication is about to be established between Trieste and New York by means of Lloyd steamers, but Austria produces so few iarticles fit for export that the speculation is not very likely to suceeed. Almost the only Austrian wares which are at present introduced into the United States are Bohemian glass, Nuremberg goods (playthings, Ac.), and Hungarian wines. The Austrian Protestants have contributed 2,380fl. towards the Luther monument at Wormrs. The depression on 'Change Is greater than ever. National Loan, bearing 5 per cent. interest, payable in slver, was at 82 ; Credit Bank Shares were but 31 per cent. above par. PRUSSIA. (FOM OUR OWN CORR FOmD"r.) BERLIN, Oor. 6. The Imperial, Royal, and Princely guests who were assembled at Potsdam yeaterday and the day before all took their departure last night and this morning, and the sudden change that has taken place in the weather, from warm summer to chilly rainy autumn, warns them to make the best of their way back to their several winter resddences. The Emperor and Empress of Russi, together with their family, whose arrival at Potgdam was retarded by the indisposition of one of the children, have been obliged to shorten the stay they intended to make at this Court, so as not to disturb the order of other travelling arrangements, and passed through here this morning on their way to Warsaw. The King accompanles them some considerable distance Into Silesa, it being on his road to the Duke of Augustenburg's residence at Primkenau, where he Is going to stay a day or so. Prince and Princess Frederick of the Netherlands left by the same opportunity for their seat at Muskau, where they will be joined shortly by the Prince of Prussia and Prince Frederick William. The King of Saxony, who arrived here yesterday, and at once passed on to Potsdam, had originally intended only to stop to dinner with the King and Queen to meet the Emperor and Empress of Russia, &c., but he was prevailed upon to remain and accompany the entire party to the Palace Theatre, so that Potsdam can also, though in a modest unobtrusive manner, emulate Stuttgart and Weimar in having been honoured with an unusual display of Royalty at its theatre. Immediately after the performance was over the King of Saxony set off in a special train for Pilinitzs. That Potsdam may not be shorn of the honours derivable from the Royal and Imperial visit to the theatre, I give you herewith a list of the geat folks present on the occasion in question. Besides the Emperor and Empress of Russia, the King and Queen of Prussia, and the King of Saxony, there were present the Prince of Prussia, Prince Frederick William, Princesa Carl, the Princes Carl, Albrecht, and Adalbort of Prussia, the Grand Ducheu of Mecklenbura. Schwerin, Prince and Princess Frederick of the Netherlands, the Hereditary Prinee of 3zTeiningen, and the Hlereditary Prince of Deasau, and of diplomatic personages Prince Gortacbakofl Baron Branow, and Baron ManteuffeL The only member of the Royal famUiy not present was the Princess of Prussia, who remains still at Coblentz, and will not come up to Berlin this year. In the course of January the Prince and Princess wi repair to England to be present at the nuptials of their son with the Princess Royai, which is fixed to take place on the 18th of that month,the anniver say of the coronation of the first King ina Pruasia, A.D. 1TC'1. The Princes of Prussia will then raturn to Coblentz, to await there the arrival of the young marrled coufle on theirourney hither. The solemn entry o the bride and bridegroom into Berlin has been fixed for February 3d Plans and preparations for sumptuous entertainments at the palaces of the Eing tsnd ths Pnnce of .rusaa, as well as in the town itself are already being made, and the municipal authorities have already informed the elders of the various trade unions that permission has been obtained for them to take part in the bridal procession on its entry into the capital. Count Perpoucher Sedlnitzkl has been appointed Ohamberlain, or, as we say, Lord in Waiting, to the Princess Royal, and for the post of Oberhiofmistrin or Mistress of the Household, a moat admirable selec- tion has been made in the Countess Perpoucher Sedlnitzkl; previous to her marriage with the Count, who has for some years represented Prussia at the Court of Darmstadt, the Countess was, as Countess de Malzahn, Baroness von Wartenberg and Penzlin, one of the Queen's Ladies of Honour * the mother of the Countess was an English lady; and her elder sister, the Countezs Alexandrine, was the late Lady Melbourne. The Bank of Prussia has again raised its rate of discount, so that it now stands at 6k per cent. ITALY. Count do Cavour gave a grand banquet on the 4th to the Princo de la Tour d'Auvergne, the new French Ambassador to the Court of Turin. The Pledmontese Ministers, the British and Pruian Ambassadors, and many other distinguished members of the diplomatic body, were among the guests. The D;ritto of Turin declarl, on what it state to be unquestionable authority, that tke life ilnsurance 'it in said in German of a person who x indifferent abiot anything, that "I Br IenC fixnf Vcra4 s80"mb said to have been concluded between Mazzini and the Advocate Brofferio is devoid of foundation as regards the latter. We learn from Florence that the Archducbess Anne, the consort of the Hereditary Prince of Tuscany, is also labouring under an attack of the measles. According to the last accounts (of the 3d), both this Princess and the Grand Dachess are progressing favourably. SPAIN. TheMasdrid journals ofthe 3d have arrived. On the previous day the usual weekly Cabinet Council was held, under the presidency of the Queen, aud the Clamor Publico says that "it appeared indubitable" that all the Ministers had resigned-that their relignations had been accepted by the Queen-that M. Bravo Murillo had been summoned by telegraph to form a new Ministry-and, lastly, that the necessry Royal decrees would appear in the Gazette of the 3d. But the aazdae contains no decrees accepting the resignations of Ministers, andno announcement on the suhject, neither do the other journals do more than repeat what has already been said, namely, that the reination wsexpected in the event of the Ministers not obtaining the Queen's consent to the removal of General Conchs from the Captaincy-General of Cuba, as 'well as of certain high functionaries from the Palace. The .Qpoca, on its part, again declares that it does not believe that, inder any circumstanoes, the Ministers will redgn before the meeting of the Cortes. Reports that the present Ministers had resolved to dissolve the Cortes in case they should be placed in a minority were current, but they were not generally credited; and the Hojas, a semi-offlcial authority, remarks that no ucth resolution can have been adopted, inasmuch as, if the Minittera posses the confidence of the Crown, they are sure to have a majority in the Cortes, and if they lose that confidence they will retire. According to the lltjas, the nomination of Count de Balmaseda to the Presidency of the Senate has been resolved on, and will be announoced as soon as the pending Ministerial crsis shall be settled. It is said that in the batch of new Senators proposed by the Ministers the Queen had peremptorily objected to the name of M. Nooedal, father of the Minister of the Interior, but Her Majesty's resaons for doing so are not given. One of the papers speaks of General Larocha as likely to be charged with the formation of a new Ministry.
THB BECENT LOSS OF A RUSSIAN MAN-OF-WAR. The Joumnal de St. Petersbourg of the 1st Inst. publishes the following official account of the loss of the Russaln ship of the line Lefort, already mentioned in the letter of our Hnamburg correspondent - " It has plesed Providence I shoud partldpate In one of the greatest disstm that can happen at sea, and to make me a Twitness of the instantaneous and inexplicable loss f one of the vesels In my fleet. A few minutea have sufced for a beautiful ship of the line, thoroughly seaworthy, to be Ongulfed by the waves during a tempestuous night Not a cry of distres reached us from the scene of the disaster although we were but four cablesd length dstant to windward. No one survives to explain to us the cause of this unparalleled catastrophe. " On the 28th of August (September 9) four sips of the llne, tho Imperatrice Alexandra, the Vladimir, the I. fort, of 84 gns, and the Pamiat Asova, of 74 guns, which were in the port of Revel, received orders to arm and turn to Cronstadt, Ten days afterwards the PaMiat Asova quitted the roads, towed bya xteam-frigate, The three other vessels were roady to set sail wo dcay, later they had water and provisions for a month, and their stowage Was the same as at the end of their craise in the preceding year; the Lefort was thoroughly repaired at Cronstadt in 1852. I had received instructions to profit by the favourable weather to set sail, Tithout waiting for the steam-tugs. On the 9th of eptember (21d) I got under sail with beautiful weather and a favourable breeze from 8.S.W., the barometer marking 2919 English Alittle later the wind freshened, and abrea of the Island of Botbhkar we were obliged to take in two reefs in the tpsail& At hal-past 8 p.m., after pasdng the land of Hochland, the feet was maidng more than U1 knots, The wlnd increasing, I ordered a third, and then a fourth reef to be taken In. The barometer being at 29 1- and the weather foggy we sailed as close as posible to the wind, endeavouring to keep our course hy short tacks until -noming; each time I gave the pgnal for the manceuvre. At half-past l the win shifted to the west, at midnight to the north-west, and at 4 o'clock to the north, with squalls and snow. At daybreak we were near the island of Grand. Tu.ers. The fleet was on the starboard tack, the Imperatrice Alexsndra a little to windwArd, and the Vladimir in the wake of the Lefort, with four reefs in her topsails. "At a distance of five miles from Tutera we veered during our maincmvre the Lefort appeared to us as if wish1ng to veer; suddenly a violent squall lad her on her side, Though her sails were lot go, she leaned ovor so much to lar. board that we expected her magi would go, but she eontinued gradualy to lean over till she foundered in the short time that the Vladimir took to tack about. The keel of the Lefort appeared once, and was then swallowed up in the waves. " Excludve of the commander and 12 officers, the vessel had on board 743 seamen, 53 women, ad 17 children; all perished. " This disaster took place on September 10 (22), at 23 minutes past 7 am., at 5; miles to the north-north-east of the island of Grand-Tuters, at a depth of 30 fathoms. After this unparalleled catastrophe, the wind continuing to increase, we brailed up the foretopsails and topgallant sais, and afterwards the maintopsails, and decided to anchor at a. depth of 31 fathoms, letting out all the cable of two anchors. Fifty-three hours afterwards the wind calmed, and the steamers, arriving in the meantime, towed us to Cronstadt. "Signed by the Rear-Admiral, " NoRDBU LIP
LORD PANfURE ONf THE INfDIAN CRISI The following are the remrks made by Lord Pamnure at the meeting of tho County gentlemen of Forfar, already alluded to in The Times:- Lord Panmure said-The business on the roll Is now concluded, but there is a subject which I wish to bring before the county, and it is one in which the whole oountry is deeply interested. It is impossible that any of you can be ignorant of what hau taken place in India; and it is equally impossible almost to speak of what has taken place there with any control over the feelings whioh come into our minds. (Hear, hear.) Scotland, as you are aware, has given many of her sons to Ind&-many of hor most distinguished men, and very many of her rising generation are in the service of the Bast India Company. You all know the savage and bratal murderS, the sacking of various stations at which Europeans were placed, and the absolute, I will not say poverty, but destitution to which an immense numbor of families, previously in circumstanoes of comfort and happiness, have by the decrees of Providence been reduced. (Rear, hear.) All over tlds land, from various otber lands, and from various quarters, subacriptions have been made for aiding these unlortunate persons *in their dire necessities; and I am quite sure it will be in accordanco with the feelings of the county of Forfar-and I believe it would be offensive to the county were I not to do so-when I propose that instead of giving our insulated subscriptions here and there, we should oome forward with a county subscription. (Applau) At the head of tis I shall be gld to place my own subscription, instead of giving In the capacity of a member of the Goverment. (Applaus.) I think the oocasion Is even greater than that on which we formerly exerted ourselves-namely, the Patriotic Fund. Iere we sbill be contributing to allevlate the suffezings of a number of individuals who have been overtaken hy the direst of all calamities, which they could not for a moment foresee, a very different ease from that of men serving their country in war, who may expect to be exposed to such disasters. Here the calamity was quite sudden, and one which those who live at home at ease are bound to take the earliest opportunity of alleviating. I would propose that the subscriptions through the county should be conduoted in the same way as with the Patriotic Fund, and that, whoen returned, they should be forwarded to the Lord Mayor of London, who has placed himself at the head of this great and most patriotic ODject. (Applause.) The Clerk stated that the machinery used for the Patriotio Fund subsoription was all complete, and could easily be pat n operation. Lord PanmureVs proposal was then unanimously adopted, and the Convener and the Clerk of Supply wtere instruated to make the necessy arrangements. EnZCToN PrIoys.-In the session 1854-55 two election petitions were disposed of by the House of Cemmons (including those withdrawn); in l1S6, two alo ; in the first session of 1857, three; and in the seenud eessoan (after the geseralelection), about 50. Daring the snd eon of 1867 nine members were unseated, chiefly for bribery, and the writs for two places were snspendode Out of 74 petltionis presented 335 were withdrawn.
THE INDIAN MINIES. The following mem~orandum connected with the Futtyghur fugitives hac beeni forwarded to us frowm Seetabuldee:- "'Up to the 3d or4th of June prints letters ware reoeived from the several officers who were stationed at Futyghur. At that period great anxiety was felt, owing to commanication with the neighbouring dlitricta having been stopped, %nd a hue and cry being raised that Sowan (irregulAr cavalry) were coming up the Grand Trunk-roa By some arrange. sments were made apparently for flight, and several boats were hired and kept in radinema for that purpons, the fort being at the same time prepared for a eiege, and a supply of provisions, &c., being laid in. The 101t Regiment Bengal Native Infantry (at Futtyghur) was thought to be true, but stiU great uneainess continuLed, so much so that the residents accepted the protection of one Hurdewl Bux, A respectable Zemindar, lving 12 miles fromn Futtygbur, on the Oude tide of the river, and proceeded there in a body. They continued with him for 10 days, it is aid, were kindly treated, and well cared for; but when the OuLde mutineers and budmashes who had joined them sent word to Hurdew Bux to the effect that they would take hil life and destroy his family and property because he befriended the Europeasn he became alarmed, And was obliged to send them alU back to the cantonments, save Mr. Prohyn, who, together with his wife and family, remained with him in conceal ment. After this, it is stated, iAeutenant Vibart took charge Of the treasury, which was left, with one gun an the, pade ground, under the custody of the 10th Regiment. Not many days after an Alarm was given that the in. surgentg (the Doobye), or 41at Regimont, from SGetapore (together with numbers of prisoners and budmashes, an immense stock of armmunition, and two guns), were on the other side of the river, intending to croms over. On hearing this the Sepoys of the 10th rusbed out of the fort, while their officers and reddents in the cantonments All repaired within it; and on seeing the panic, Lieutenant Vibart rushed down to the parade and spiked the guns, which act greatly infu. nated the 10th. The mutineern eventually crossed over and called upon the 10th to fraternire and share the trea msr With them, but this they resolntely declined, on which they fought for it, the Sepoys of the 10th being greatly slaughtered, as they had no guns and but little ammunition. Simultneously with this fight all the bungalows and public building were destroyed. T'he Nawab of Frttyghur (who see sto hxve besn very instrumental in destroying and sizing propersy) gare particular instructions for the demolition of the electrio telegraph, poeta, wires, &c., and received read assistance from the villaser of Hoeseinpors. It is reported that inothing has been left standing in canton. ment*, and that the Nawab had sntries poted over the gun ariage manufactory, clothing aency, &C. After the treasure was plundered and divided among the rebels and budmashes and the fort had been bseged for nine days and nights, with incemssnt firing on both sides, but without any appearance of surrender froma thoee who were within, the Nawab, It is said, became very much annoyed, a the insurgenta had promised to thke the fort in six days, during which perlod he had fed ana paid them. Fresh efforts were then made, and scaling ladders resorted to, butl 11 to no purpose; for the four genUtlemen who manned and fired the guns were indefatigable in their exertions, and never slept or left them by day or night during the whole period. Colonel Tudor Tucker, two brothers named Jones nd Mr. Edward M. Jame3, an assistant in the opium' department, were the four gunners; but on the day preViOus to their evacuating the lort Colonel Tucker was shot in the head, when looking through one of the em'brasnxre or loopholes. One of the Mesrs Jones shared the sme fateand they were buried together the same evening. The i0th Regiment had nothing to say to the attack on the fort, and it is reported that very few of them escaped with any booty they might have collected as the vilhgers waylaid them in all direotion, "During the siege a ball gnazed the head of Colonel Goldie, but did no great harm. mr. Thornhill, C.d., in. jured his arm with his pistol, and some of the ladies (among them one of the Misses Goldie and a girl of about 12 or 14 yeas of age) were wounded. Great mischief Was dono by the insurgents, who had taken up their position on the roof of a bigh two-storied house in Howeinpore, which overlooked the fort, and the besiege bad Rgrt dMiaculty in making a covered vay to protect their servants, to enable them to pas to and fro with the meals for the ladles and children, who were colleoted in a room or godown to the lee of the two-storied house. The Nawab seems to have done all he could against the Englih, and holds possossion of all their property-houses, crriages,valuables, &o.-with the exception of Mr. probyn'es, which is With Hurdew Bnxt There does not appear to have been any deficiency of aubstantial food Inside the fort, such as meal, flour, tea, rice, &c., but the grea want was mliuc and light food for the childrtn. The Imm,ediate reson for leaving the fort is not known, but it would seem that all hands were embarked about the 10th of July on board three boats, which were kept ready under the fort, and into them the ladies and ohildren were let down one morning, at about 2 o'clock. In one boat there W nothing but Colonel Goldie's property, and it was abandoned before daybreak. On the other two boats all the fugitives were distributed, but there were only one or two dandies (or boatmen) between them. They proOeded down the Ganges with great difficulty, As they started with the f=t ris of the river, and the channels were Invisible. At dawn they reached a viage about two kosa (four miles) from Fattyghur, whore money was advanced to the bort-dandies to procure men to help them; bat, instead of dandies boing brought, information was takes. to the Nawab's people, and a large multitude camo down to the river to seize the boats and their inmates. A good deal of fighting pasred, and before the whole of the fugitives could be collected into one boat Lieutenant Simp. son was shot dead, and as he appeared to be personally Arranging about the boats oonfusion followed, when ms. Jones, one of the Miss Goldies, a daughter of a stout, elderly gentleman, name not remembered, but stated as Maclean, or some such name, and the girl of 12 or 14 years of age wrer all seized and taken off by the mob to the Nawab. A Sepoy, namsed Klley Ehan, eaid to belong to the 10th Regiment, was in this boat, and used his utmost endeavours to rescue the party, hiding M Jones and taldng care of the ohild. Eventually Mis Goldie, the other young lady, and the gLrl were taken up to the Nawab, and on remonstrating about their quarters And food they wrer accommodated with a house in one of the Nawab's gardLns Mrs. Jones's fate is not known, Colonel Goldie's baggage boat having been abandoned and the second boat left behind after Lieutenant Simpson wa shot and the remaining inmates had been seized, the fugitives proceeded together in the tird boat, which is desonbed to have been a light fas-pulling one, well provisioned, and well supplied with guns, amunition, And fir,arms. There were on board also four sycees (grooms) and twro kitmutgars (table servants), who, together with the gentlemOn on board, pulled the boat, under the guidance of a very true and faithful old manges (boatman), an Inhabit. ant of Futt eyghur. The fugitives were chased and fired at aU the way down the river, but managed to eoape as far as Bithoor, opposite or near bo which town the mangee was unfortunately shot, and their boat grounding in 6onsequsn,e on a chur was brought up. No sooner wasthis seen than the boat was surrounded, seized, and taken on to Cawupore " The following names have been given to me as some oi the fugitives who were on board the boat; the namae of others are not known ; bat they were all thken to the Aseembly-rooms, the children being eonveyed in vehicles, but the rest proceeding on foot En rotc they do not appear to have been molested or annoyed in any manner, and, from what I can gather, some respectable people intercsde.

The very night provious to the arrlval of our troops, and when the Nena (the fiend) saw all was up with him, he ordered all the fugitives to be murdered, and a gang of butchers and othersarshed into the Axsembly.rooms and dlaughtered them. " The sufferings of the fugitives en rotza from Futtyghur to Cawnpore were great. The hands of the gentlemen who were on board and pulled the boats were greatly blistered and they were worn out with fatigue and inoemant hard work inside the fort. Several of their ervant had fled from Futtyghur, and the poor ladies and children had bnt little attendance. This, I think, maore than anything lse disheartened the beeieged, for eould they have held on but a little longer all would have been right, uz the mutineera and Insurgents had expended their ammunition, the Genges had conmmenced rising, and our troops were on the point of re-oocunpying Cawnpore ; but God'a will be done I "This statemeat hs been prepared from information given by Mr. B.

The folowring are extracts of letters from the Rev. James Kennedy, dated Benares, Auguat 20 and 21 : " For some dayg after the last mall left us we were in a ztate of great excitement. An Irregular cavalry regimert, which had murdered their offioers in a most eruel and treacherous manner, made their way to Jaunpore, about 35 miles from Benares. The rocd ix good and well-bridged throughout. Theee villins ha gathered around themr a large body of men of the bmaer sort, wel armed, and gave out boldly that they intended to attack BenareL Parties of them rode in the direcion of our city, ais i to show what they wr to do. We had no cavalry to send agnst them, and with the vat city unprotected it was not considered safe to send any of our 300 EmglIsh aoldiers in the Jaunpore direction. Besides, th troopers might ealy pas them by takiDng a detour, and dash on us when we hd no soldiers to detend us One part of our station, whio ia called the Ciyil Linea, where ae the gaolx, the oou*,, the houses of the commissioner, judge, magitrate, civil doctor, and others, was peculiarly open to attack. It lies to the north of the Barnah river, while the cantonments and the rest of the jtation lie to the south, the two parts of the sation being connectd by tho Burnah bridge. The river Is at present happily In flood. ALl thbt could be done was to poe a strong perty of soldiers and two gun on the bridge. "The prisoners were haily removed to the north side, the courts were abandoned,-all Taluable property was removed, and now on the north side there romain onay empty houses. " We had one day of ununa stir. Our native ChristiAg were debating anxioualy what they ought to do, and we felt not a lttle difflcalty in giving them oounsL In the event of an outbreak they imeld be among the first sufferers. In the afternoon letters were w nrec d by the authoritles, informing them that the Segowlee mutineers intended to atthck the tation that night, and that they fully expected to be joined by a party of maloontents from the city. Their plans, there is no doubt, wee all formed, but at the lat moment their hearts failed them. In theevening, however, there was afearfl thougcaunel panic at Raj-ght ,where tihe intrenchment Is being made. The ry aroe, 'The enemy are coming.' The workmen, 3,000 In numbor, rushed downz the hill a for their Uve Priacores who were at work tried to make their aecpe, and were with difflaclty re. covered. Gentemen ran for their rifle; the soldien got under arms; the gmnen rushed to their guns, and, alto. gather, there was indescribable oonlusion and terror. AlU this was the reslt of a nsucedon of peal of thunder, whlch were mistaken for the firing of artillery I " No sooner were we beginning to feel eaier about the Segowlee men than intelligenoe arrived that a large body of the Dinapore mutineers, joined by their caste men, were marching on us. The Ganges, no -a1 stream in these days, was, however, betwee us and them. They came on the Trunk-road to within 14 miles of our city. Colonel Gordon sent out against them the most of our English soldiers, leaving the station so bare that for three nights the residents helped the soldiers by acting ma sentitels, writh the judge at their head. The Colonel dreaded the advance of the Dinapore mutineers to the neighbourhood of the city lest their presenoe should cause a rising, and as they had no cavalry he thought they might be overtaken, But they were too nimble for our men. Hearing of their approach, though armed and numerous, they did not wait for them, but made off for the Mirzapore district. MIr. Sherring returned from Kirzapore yesterday. The streets there are barricaded, much property has been buried, otherpropertylainboatsontheriver,thel&m atndstrongest house in the plac is intrenehed, and ther are between 400 and 500 English soldiers; so that the hope is entertained thit all will remain sae. The rebels look as if they wished to keep cler of the city with its present defences, and make their way into Oude. The Trunk-road is again open to Calcutta, to our great joy. Thinp have taken a favourable turn in Behaxr, and that takes away one great source of danger to us. " Our preeervation hitherto hs been marvellous, and If we pams sfely through this fiery pariod there wll not be a community in Northern India that will have so much reason for special gratitude as ours Excluding the Punjab and country beyond, this is the only first-class city in the North-Westernr Povinoes which has esped plunder. ing; while of all cities it was the one which seemed most exposed, owing at once to the fanatical character of the po. pulation and the Europeans being left so defenceless; and, owing, some would add, to its having a greeter number of misdonaries than any other city In India exoept Calcutta. Again and again we have appeared on the verge of destruction. We are only now beginning to know the perils through which we have passed. Some nights we lay down i seeming ecuity, when onr very hounF wem told of for the assassin I But the fiendish man who were to masscre us 'could not find their hands.' The Providence of God saved us from their violence. " The frAmework of our misdon still oontinues, and some. thing more. The central school meets regularly, though on rather a diminiehed scale. The branch schools exist with one exception, and our nativo congregations, diminished some. what, meet regularly for God's worship. In the European hospitals I find also en important sphere of lAbour; and, while these opportunities of doing good continue, It is plainly my duty to remain at my post'" AGRA. The following is from a eivilian at Agra " July 27. "My dearest Mother,-I have your letters of May 2 and 19, and June 3 all unanswered, and I am very much Afraid you wiU all think I have been made into ourry by these dainty Mussulmen, who think we are so few in this part of the country that they can swallow us up in a mouth. fuL However, they hAve already begun to find out we are too tough for them, and at Delhi and at Cawnpore must regret that they ever attempted anything so rash as to oppose our Government and try how they oould manage matters for themselves. At the time I Am writing the only places we nold in the the North-West Provinces are Agra, Meerut, nd Allahabad, though the report is that reinforce. rnents have reached Cawnpore and that the rebels there are thoroughly out up. The only news we get is through spies, and natives always invnt so much th t it is hard to know what to bdieve. The whole of Agra is burnt down, and the inhabitants have been in the fort for a month, a place vre used occasionally to visit as a sight, little thinking we should ever make it our residence.

After one month the whole district wa quiet, and on the 1st of July they had paid up 28,ODDr. revenue, which we sent in to Agra, and I returned to my post; and the Xotah, too, were ordered into Agra, as our gaol guard, hearing of a little ad. vantage gained in Delhi, mutinied and ran eff in the night, and, s there were no Sepoys to corrupt them in Agra, we thought it advisable to bring the Kot6bs in. At th4, time there was a large force at Fcttehpore Sikri of the rnutineers from Neemach, and all the disbanded Sepoys they could pick up on the road5,000 strong, well armed, and with guns, 39 pounders, and one 24-howitzer. These were threatening Agra, where we had only 700 of,the 3d Fusileerg, and a small battery of 9. pounders-the whole oountry round upr in arms, and the Government perfectly paralyzed, exoept just in the canton. ment of Agra itself. Such was the state of afairs when I returned on the lstof July. A militi was formed from the office men, of which there are about 100 in Government employ, the railway men, &n,and all Europeans, commanded by the several offioers from the disbanded Sepoy reglments here.

SALMON FISHERY LAWS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As there exists an intention among some of our legislators to introduce new laws to regulate the salmon fisheries of England in the next session of Parliament, allow me, through the mediun of your columns, to call the attention of those gentlemen to one of the most flagrant practices which can possibly exist with respect to the destruction of breeding salmon and glutting the markets with unwholesome food. All along the north- east coast of England, from Shieldp to Berwick, and for some portion of the coast of Scot land, now that the legal season for fishing hau ter. minated, the fishermen along the coast immediately set to work and fit out extensive fleets of nets, which they either drift with the current of the tide, or fasten them across narrow inlets, near the mouths of the various rivers dehouaching on that coast. By these means large quantities of fish are catught, chiefly salmo criox, all im an advanced state of pregnancy, and quite unfit for human food. These fish hover about the coast near the mouths or estuaries of rivers, until floods take them up the rivers to spawn, and in that helpless and wasted state they are disposed of at night and sent to Paris or our inland towns. This system of fishing, I may add, is quite legal, or rather there is no legislation under which it can be put down; all the statutes for the preservation of salmon fisheries in England only relate to the rivers, and none are applicable to sea coast fishing for salmon, which system of fisling is of comparatively modern invention, and was not contemplated by the law makers of bygone days; and although it were rendered illegal in the next session of Parliament the practice will continue until there be some machinery created to put it down, for, although there is a stringent law for the Scotch coast there is no officer to enforce it, and the traveller by the North British Railway mnay see from the carriages, a few miles north of Berwick the sea studded with nets in defiance of the law. U-ntil all the markets in Britain be stopped for the sale of foul sal non, and the police or market inspectors be emPowered and required to seize them where they can be found, and those sent to the Parisian market, to which the balk of them are consigned, be seized by the Custom-house officers and heavy penalties inflicted, the practice will continue to prevail, the breed of the salmon will continue to diminish, and the public be cheated out of their money. It is only of late years that the evil I allude to has sprung up, and is chiefly in consequence of the demand in Paris and the railway system of conveyance; for the fishermen themselves esteem these fish so lightly that they never eat them in the state in which they now are, and from the price paid here for them they cannot be sold ln Paris much under 2s. per lb. if our legislators succeed in making a good code of laws, and provide the mneans of carrying them out, no one acJualnted with the history and tbhe habits of the salmon will floubhat py proper protection they may be increased nfinitely, and brought wiithin the power of being purchased by the humbler classes of the community, who nowr never taste salmon.

CONKSEBRYAT13E DBIMONSTRATION IN BSSBX. The annual meeting of the Hinckford Agricultural and Conservative Club was held on Tuesday evening at the Bell Inn, Castle Hedingham. Among the gentlemen present were the Right Hon. Mr. Beresford, MP., Mr. Ducane, MLP., Mr. Mller, 3LP., Mr. Olney Saville Olney, Mr Magende, Colonel Brise, Captain Way, and several of the clergy and gentry of the northerzn division of the county. The prime to agrioultural labourers and farm servants having been distributed by Mr. Olney in the High-street of Castle Hedingham, in the presence of several ladies and gentlemen, the members of the club dined together in the large room of the Bell, where a very handsome repast was prepared. The chair waa taken by Mr. Olney. After the usual loyal and patriotic toasts, The CIR rose and said, that they were mot that evening to give a public welcome to the members for the northern division of the county. Sinoe the members of the club had last assembled there had been a general election, but the Northorn Division of Essex had not been embroiled in a contest, because the moral influence of the constitutIonal principles advocated by the club had, so to speak, Irrigated the soil to euch an extent that tvro healthy plants had been produced which no one desired to see changed. He need not sAy that he referred to Major Beresford and Mr Ducane. The club had not assembled for a year, and yet what changes had taken place in that short period I When they met last October they were exulting at the brilliaat achievements of the British arms in the Crimea. Peacs was upon every man's lips, and the sword of the nation was about to be turned into a ploughshare. Bat how sadly was not the picture now reversed? The old China qneetion, ones twisted and turned to suit election purposes, was completely laid aside, and a new and absorbing topic engrossed the public mind. India found utterance in every tongue, and pressed like a heavy weight on every bosom. What heart was there that was not at first inclined to sink at those calamities? But yet It was not the part of Britons to despair. In the spirit of the nation he believed that a solution would be found for the difficulties that now threatened our Indian empire, and he trusted that by the energy of action and harmony of counsel of those who conducted the Government of the country such steps would be taken as would at once and for ever frustrate the artifices and cruelty of the Sepoys and Mahometans. (Hear-) He would not refer to other political topics, as the members for the county were present and would no doubt allude to them, but he would simplv recommend them to take care of the registration (hear, hear), for depend upon it attention to this particular was the first element of political success as a party. (Hear, hear.) In conclusion, he begged to propose " Prosperity to the Hinckford Agricultural and Conservatlve Club," (Applause.) Mr. MAJENDIE responded to the toast, and observed that the result of the last general election by no means favoured the assumption that the Conservative causa was faUing off, or that the Coneervatives sa &body had less Influence now than heretofore in the country. He contended that Lord Palmerston himself was a Conservative element in the present Ministry, and, that as long as his life was spared the Conservative cause would receive a fair measure of consideration from the Coalition Cabinet. The great question of the day was India, and he was prepared to say that, whether the Ministry were Coalition, Conservative, or Whig, it would receive from the country all the support that was necessary to enable it to deal with the present emergency. The next question which would occupy the attention of the Legislature was the state of the representation; and when this subject was mentioned, he could not but congratulate the county of Essex on having two Conservative membersmen who were friends to the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the democracy, who would labour to preserve the true balance between all classes, and who would vigorously oppose all reforms or changes which, in their opinion, would be prejudicial to the safety of the realm and the happiness and prosperity of the people. (Applause.) The promised Reform Bil by Lord Palmerston reminded him of the " dark horse" at the Derby-no one knew anything about It, yet every one was talking of it. He did not pretend to know anything about the mystery; but this he would say, that when the dark horse Palmerston was trotted out he would back him against the performances of the otherhorseRusselL of whom the country already knewsomething. (Hear.) LordPalmerston hadshown himself Conservative at heart when he voted against household suffrage, a measure which, if carried, would swamp the sgrcultura interest. (Elear, hear.) Mr. Maiendie concnuded by proposing "T The Healths of Major Beresford and Mr. Ducane.' The toast having been drunk amid loud cheers, Major BEnrzomR) acknowledged the compliment and said that often as he had risen in that room to respond to the toast of his health, he had never done so under a deeper sense of the utility, advantage, and importance of the society they had assembled to celebrate that day. During the recent elections to which Mr. Majendie had referred, while political contests were raging around, while some seats were In jeopardy, and whUie others were lost to the cause of Conservatism, Mr. Ducane and himself had been returned without opposition, and without the rumour of a contest. (Applause.) There could be no doubt that this success was to be traced to the society, and he had no doubt that if a similar organization had existed in South Essex his exceUent friend Sir WilUiam Bowyer Smith would have been returned for that division of the county. He acknowledged that he felt a just pride In being chosen one of the representatives of the great county of Essex, and be assured his constituents, on his own behalf and on that of Mr. Ducane, his coUeague, that the local interests of the countyshould not suffer in their hands; and now, referriog to the session that had passed, ho was bound to say that they could not boast of having passed or opposed many important measures. It was not to be expected that when the House of Commons met so late in the year it could do a great deal. Many useful measures, however, were carried, and if the session were not a brilliant one, it had at least been productive of some good to the country. (Hear, hear.) The only question in which the county of Essex was directly affected was that relating to the registration of wills and administrations, and all the efforts of the county members to procure a court of registry at Chelmsford for the northern division of the county had been frustrated by the Attorney-General, wbo had awtually promised a deputation which waited upon him for the purpose that their recommendation in favour of North Essex would be agreed to by the Government. Leaving local questions, however, for the present, there were ore or two subjects upon which he wished to offer a few remarks. In the first place, it was impossible to attend an agricultural meeting without being struck with the gondness of the Almighby in sending an abundant harvest. He was delighted to witness in Essex and other counties the exuberance of the harvest. He rejoiced to find the farmers tbriving-to see their rickyards filled with grain, and to k-now that they received not an exorbitant but a remunerative return for their labour and capital. (Hear, hear.) He regretted that he could not approach the consideration of the other question with the same feelings of gratififation. The mutiny in India was a sulbject upon which the thoughts of the whole nation were centered. He be. lieved that mutiny was the result of a deep-laid Mahomedan plot of the vilanous Hindoos, concocted and commenced by the Moslems to recover their power in the East by the extermination of Christianity and the massacre of all the Christians in India. It might appear strange, but it was a matter of gratification to his mind that the extirpation of Christianity was a part of their design, for he firmly believed that the Suprame Power, that theGod above, in whose hands was the dominion of the earth, would saD. port the cause of truth and of His word, and that if the Eng. glishnationremRinedtruetotheir religion and flinched not from aSserting their Christianity in spite of the dictates of policy or the promptings of expediency, He would assist their arms and enable them to establish Christianity in India on a firmer and more permanent basis. (Hear, hear.) This mutiny had been marked with a degree of atrocity which it was frightful to contemplate, and which was as abhorrenti to Christians as it was opposed to all the dictates of Christianity. He was sorry to hear that there were persons in the House of Commons and out of t who had said " For God's sake, temper your justice with mercy." He believed that as a general principle justice was necessary and right, but that in this Instance mercy would be thrown away. (Hear, hear.) He believed that justice-retributive justicewas what we should look to alone. We should not practise vengeance because vengeance belonged to a higher power, but we ought not to shrink from being the instruments to p anish the awfal crimes which the natives of India had perpetrated upon their European fellow-subjects. He was glad to see that TheTunmes, whose influence over the opinions of the conntry was at all times very great, had taken the proper view of this question. That journal, ecno-sng --vic of--- th conr,si,"Dlim-ed echoing th-e vic of the country, said, II Delhl must be de. stroyed." He agreed in that expression, and he maintained that if they reflected for a moment upon the scenes which had occurred in Delhi they would agree with him that as the place had been polluted it should be burnt with fire and rased to the ground. (Hear, hear.) We had many examples In Holy Writ to justify such a course. The cities of Sodom and Gomorrab, where crimes of a kindred nature were committed, were destroyed by fire from Heaven. We had not fire from Heaven, but we knew that man had destroyed other cities by the express permission of God and as a punishment for their crimes. Nineveh and Babylon, also, the two greatest cities of the East, were warned of their destruction. Nineveh was not destroyed by fire, but by the hand of man-by Nebuchad. nezzar, who destroyed it not by his own power, but by the power conferred upon him by the Almighty, who made him an instrument of vengeance in his hands. So, too, B.oylon was destroyed by Cyrus. The name of Cyrus was mentioned by the prophet as the future destroyer of Babylon, and he did it fully. So total had been the destruction of those doomed cities that the site of Nineveh was only discovered lately, while considerable doubt still exists as to the spot upon which the proud city of Babylon once stood, although it iS known that its waUs occupied a cirouit of 60 miles. They were destroyed for their crimes, and so should it be with Delhi and Cawnpore. In his opinion, it was nothing but mawkish sentimentality to talk of sparing the polluted places. Although he confessed he was in favour of destroying DeWli and the other places in which these atrocities were committed, and although he would punish with death all who had committed those hideous crimes, not sparing one,-still he agreed to this extent with those who talked of mercy that as the mutinies were not general, and as a great porton oi India was untainted with crime, he would not extend the measure of justice to all parts and to all people. He said this that he might not be held up as cruel for saying that those who massacred women and children were miia creante whom no Englishmen would spare, much leesthe English moldier. The mazwkish aentimentallste who would advocate mercy, Instead of justioe need not be afraid that the English soldier would forget his mission or abuse his wer. (Hear, hear.) The Englis& soldier was as humane as e0 wax bre. . If the natives of India had onlT mutinied the British soldier would have fought them while they had arms In their hands, but he would have spared the foe 'who supplicated for mercy but the misreant who could massacre women and children would find no mercy from the British soldier. (Eear, hear.) He had read such tales of horror in the newspapers within the last few months thaI he declared tbat if the last ten years had not weighed so heavily on his shoulders he would go out to India and fight, and spare not. (Applaute.) So much with regard to events passing in India, but as Co&W servatives and Englishmen they had other views to take, and they were bound to consider the question of India with respect to their own feelimgs, sentiments, and conduct. In his opinion Her Majesty's Mnisters deserved and ought to receive, in the present emergency, the support of every patriotic Conservative. Atthe commenoementof themutiny the Minitry were beset b many diffculties. The suddenness of the outbreak- theiemissnessto some extentof theexecutive in India, and the distanceof the scene of the war, all operated to the disadvantage of the Government; but, in his opinion their greatest difliculty was to be traced to the recent and moEt unwise reduction of our military establishmentt. (Hoea.) That reduction, although carried out by Lord Palmerston, was, he (Major Beresford) believed, agreed to against the desires and convictions of the noble lord, and was in direct opposition to his views as a atatesman, and to the system which as an able War Minister and as an earnest defender of the honour of England he hbd always advocated. (Hear, hear.) As an illustratlon of this he might refer to the circumstance that in the oommencement of the last sesion Mr. Gladstone andMr. Disraelihadthreatened an attaok upon the financisl policy of the Government, and that Lord John Russell had deprecated the continuance of a large military expenditure, These attacks, backed by the Peace party out of doors and by their representatives in the House naturally alarmed the Government. Nor were the people of the oountry in a mood to tolerate anyheavy expenditure for the maintenance of a defensive force. The people were always willing to be taxed where the expenditure was required to uphold the n4tlonal honour and to protect their fellow*subjeots abroad, but when the immediate danger was past and the honour of the oountry was secure they forgot their military enthu. slasm and called for a diminution of the national establishments. Lord Palmerston saw the danuer, but yielded to the storm and saved his position. He (Major Bereeford) believed that theooneessionwas an unfortunate circumstance, and that the evil oonsequenoes had proved moet serious to the army and to the natfon Inthe spring of 1857 we disbanded a body of troops which had been raised at considerable outlay, and which had been trained to the art of war at a great expense. They were turned adrift upon the world, and in a few months afterwards we were obliged to strain every nerve to raise recruits from the plough tail and the loom. These men were, of counse ignorant of the simplestdetailsoftheir newprofession, andtheresult was that a oonsiderable time must elapse before they oould be caed into active servioe. We were, in fact, paying more for a worse article than would have suffed to purchase a good one-phying In fact, the old game of pemny wise, pound fooli (iear, hear.) On the oocasion of the last election he had ventured to deprecate a coalition between Lord Derby, Mr. Gladstone, and Mr. Sidney Herbert, and his reason for doing so was the conviction he entertained that any such coalition would have been immediAtelyfolowed bq nextensivereductioninthe militaxy establishments of the country. He mentioned this to show that these were no newly conoeived opinions but that they had always been the fixed views to which he had adhered as to a principle, and that they were now strengthened by the additional experience of the last few months. Notwithstanding these obstacles, Lord Palmerston had done all in his power to meet the emergency, and he had no doubt but the noble lord would continue to act with the same vigour 'whichhad characterized his management of thewar. (Hear, hear.) With diminished means he had already sent out a magnificent army to the East as fast as it could be sent, although if there had been more transports at hand the troops might have boen despatched with even greater rapidity. This, however was not the fault of the noble lord, but of those who had forced him to reduoe the defensive power of the country. The force sent to the East oonsisted for the most psrt of Crimean regiments, and his (Major Bereeford's) darling son was among them. What did Lord Palmerston next do 9 He seleted the best, the ablest, the boldest, and the most determined soldier in Lngland to be Commauder-in-Chief in India. He said to the Duke of Combridge "' Can I have Sir Colln Campbell to go to India?" "You can," replied the Duke, and the next day the anpointment was made, and Sir Colin Campbell was on his way to India at four-and-twenty hours' notice. (Applause.) He had no hesitation in saying there was no man in the English army so competent for the appointment. The great military authority of the age after the Dake of We1inton, the late Sir C. Napier, who knew Sir Colin Campbe l we 'when he held a very inferior appointment in India, said of him on one oocasion when dangerthreatened at Peshawur, "Allis right because Sir Colin Campbell is there." (Hear hear.) If, then, Lord Palmerston had done his best In the present crisis-and he believed he had-it behoved al patriotic Conservatives to give him their support. A.s an honest and a patriotic member, that would be his course. He had no desire to oppose the Government when he believed they were acting for the best in a moment of great national peril, neither would he ever oppose them except when the safety of those principles were at stake to the maintenance of which he was pledged. (Hear, hear.) It was not, horever, to be suppoeed that he could give his support to a Whig Government, even when led by Lord Palmerston; but he would be no party to hampering a Governmentwhich was doing everything in Its power to maintain the honour of the country (hear, hear); he would be no varty to acquiring political capital at the expense of the foitunes of his country; and if he knew anything of the sentiments of his constituents they would praise him for adopting such a couarse, and they 'would not say he was a turnl-coat end had deserted the Conservative cause. The right hon, and gallant gentleman concluded amia loud applause. Mr. D'CAxxE next returned thanks, and observed that in giving an account of his political stewardship he had little political capital to boast of; at the same time he hoped the votes he had recorded in the course of the last session were given conscientiously in defence of those Conservative inciples to the maintenance of which he was pledged. With res.ect to Lord Palmerston, it was quite true, as his right hon. colleague had said, that the noble lord had bowed to the storm he could not resist; but there were times when the old Conservative leaven was stirred up within him, and it was upon those occasions he had resisted Mr. Berkeley's motion for the ballot, and Mr. Locke King's precious piece of legislation intended to abolish the property qualification of members of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) It was quite true that the Ministry had not one much in the course of the lIst session, but if they were niggardly In their performances they had beea lavish in their promises for next year; and if they only performed half what they promised they would be the most liberal Ministry that ever occupled the Treasury bench. The oftpromised, but oft-postponed Reform Bil was the first measure to which Government was pledged, but as Lord Palmerston's reform mountain had so often laboured without producing even a mouse, it was to be feared the party so much interested in Parliamentary reform would be grievously disapDointed. The noble lord had, however, made himself responsible on the part of the Ministry for a new Reform Bil, and however content he might ho to sit quietly there was a noble lord behind him who was quite prepared to take the matter out of his hands at the shortest possible notice. In the absence of any definite measure he would not commithimslcf to any pledge but this he would say, that any measure to which he would givehis support must he very different from the last abortive creation of Lord John Russell, and something very different from the mischievous measure of Mr. Locke King. He trusted that any measure which would be brought forward would have for its object rather to amend than to extend the errors of the measure of 1832, and that those who framed it would be guilded by the true principle of giving every interest in the State its due importance in relation to the property represented by it. (Hear, hear.) Having referred at some length to domestic policy the hon. gentleman proceeded to say that he should not be doing justice to his own feelings if he were not to touch upon the all-absorbing topic of India. This wAs a subject that offered all that was horrible,painful, and heartrending with regard to the present, and ed us with anxiety as regarded the future. The streets of Delhi and the slaughterhouse of Cawnpore called for vengeance and justice. (Hear, hear.) The coause which the representatives of the people had to foLow was plain xand uneqmvocaL They were bound to combine not to overthrow a Minister, but tosave an empire. He would therefore enjoin the linister of the day to tax to the uttermost the great resources of the country and to send the last man and the last ship to protect our fellow-countrymen and to uphold the honour and national greatness of the empire. Depend apon it If they did this, the people would mate no cold response. While he would not make the present crisis the occasion of a display of party feeling, he thought the Government of the day had something to answer for for disregarding the signs and tokens of the coming storm, and for endeavouring to represent that as the outbreak of a few dissatisfied individuals which was in fact a great armed revolution of one of the moat important of the Indan presidenoe'. H_1e dld _n_ot -wris to enter upon the cause of those outbreaks, but he must say that in the withdrawal of our troops for the prosecution of the war with Persia and in the commencement of the Chinese hostties was to be found the source of the calamity 'which had left half India at the mercy of the barbarian. It was not,ihowever, without hopo that he looked forward to the future. We should have to put forward our utmost resources, but he believed we should emerge from the struggle, and that having executed vengeance and justice 'we should stamp out the mutiny and re- Dion from the unhapy lnd. He hoped, however, that when the earthquake had done its work and the fire had executed Its mission the gentle voice of mercy would be heard, and that by a wise and comprehensive and Christian form of government the stability of our Indian empire would continue for ages. (Hear, hear.) He was not in favour of those who advocated vengeance and not retributive justice, neither could he agree with or sanction in any way the attacks upon Mr. Disraeli for venturing to remind the country that vengeance belonged to the Highest Power. He would conclude in the words of one of England's most Illustrious statesmen- ' The sword we dread not of ourselves secure "Firm were our strength, our peace and freedom sure, " Let all the world oonfederate all their Powevr, se they not backed by those that should be ours, *- gigh on his rock shahl Britain's geLdus stand, " Scatter the crowded h6as and indicate the land." (Ioud cheers.) Colonel BRiSE then proposed " success to agriculture, trade, and commerce," coupling the toast with "the health of MIr. Miller, M.P." (Cheers.) Maior BitRZFORD said he wished to state in explanation that he had never alluded to any opinions given by Mr. Di9raeli, and that he had merely referred to the view which The Times had taken as to the measure of justice to be meted to the rebels. Mxr, MmILms, inrespondingto the toast of his health, said that if ther was anr reason why we should gain oolonies and fight to maintain t em, it was to enoouraze agrculture, trade, and oommerce, and to introdnoe the regious nd libe ral institutions which we ourselves were permitted to enjoy. While oonsiderin thi subject, it would not be altogether inappropriate to reulect upon the causes which had led to the dreadful evilsthat nowa esolAted onr lndian empire. He did nothesittetotsaythatasanatlonwohadnotgivensufficient enceouragement to the progrees of agriculture and art in our Indian poeselionx, (-ear,hear.) We had pogsessed the greater portion of India for 100 years, and it seemed to him that ther ha been a cad want of energy on the lpart of this country in establishing the Christian religion and that we had always exhibited too great a reluctance to Interfere with the prejudices of the Hindoos and Mahomed&TUL d it nobeen for this, the progress of civilization woul1d, In -.1l probability, hvav prevented the lamentable bloo4shed that had lately occurred. Armies might oon. quer a country, but they could not maintain it in peace. Nothing, in his opinion, could estblish permanent peace in India but the introdaction of religion and of the other blessings which religion and enlightenment brought in their train; therefore he maintained that if there had been a greater infusion of European faith, customs, and opinion much more would have been accomplished than coald have been effected by direct means for the tranquillization and civilization of India. Whil we were endeavouriog to pro. mote Christianity we ought not to shut our eyes to the fact that it was not a country like Africa and other lands entirely benighted and uncivilized. In India we had prejudices to conque and a religion to extirpate before we could teach our own, and we ought to hAve worked upon the native mind with God's love rather than by acts of violence. This was not a time to trace the causes of therevolt, but he would ask whether in connexion with IndiA we had not something to learn, something to regret, and something to reproach ourselves with. He feared it was too true that taxes had been collected with torture, and that the Christian name and religion had not been exhibited in India in their proper light (Hear, hear.) Daring the ensuing session of marliament the House of Commons would no doubt be occupied with the questiou of the future goverumentof India to the exclusdon of every other subject. Many other objects were also talked of, but he believed the representatives of the people would not be doing their duty to the country if, ln considering the important question of our emp in Indih, they did not endeavour to me a sysem of Government for the future -which would render the recurrence of horrors similar to the present impossible. He could not help feeling that the ELast India Comi pany had been too much a trading company, and had conined Itself too much to the pecuniary advantages arisng from its connexion with India and too little to more imnortnt considerations. He had no hesitation in saying that it would be a question for Parliament to decide whether the East India Compay should exdst any longer, or whether the Government of the country ought not to be made dlrectly resposible for the proper government of India. (Hear, hear.) It had stuck him with astonishment as a new member to and that the House appeared to be always wearied with debates on India, and that a count out was often the fate of discssions and motions having reference to It. Thelfact was neither the House nor the Government had paid suffioient attention to India, but he trusted that both would now take a lemson from the past. Dreadful as the past had been-horrible and revolt[l as the atrocities had been, good might yet come out of evi-, and a Government might bFe established in India in which life and proparty might be secured. (Applause.) :everal toasts of a local chacter foUlowed. The company did not separte until a late hour.
MIL BAXTER, M.P., ON THE LATB SESSION. Mr. Baxter, XP. for the Montrose burgbs, has been addressing his constltuents. He appeared beforethem at Azbroath on Tueeday evening, In the Corn-Exchange, the large hall of which waa well filled. Provost Lurgair was in the chair, supported by the other magistrates and members of the Town-CounciL The Provost introduced Mr. Baxter in a very complimentary speech, and the hon. gentleman was received with much cheering. Ile began by expressing his cordial thanks for the kind manner in which he had been received, and for the many valuable suggestions which had been sent to him from his constituents. He than went on to say:-Gentlemen, it is searcely necessvary for me to tell you that last session of Parliament was one of the most harassing and uninteresting which has taken place for msny yers. We had constant late hours, excessvely hot weather, and an unusual amount of private budness ; while there was a total ablenoeof political excitement or partygossip. No great questions o national importance were debatod. and, although several measures of great practical benefit passed both Houses, they were not, generally speaking, of a naturo to excite much luterest elther among the members or out of doors. Bnt do not suppose that they were of small moment merely on that account * for I think those men who have most lo6ely wratched dhe Imperial Legislture ,will tell us that a session of brilliant debates is not generally a sesslon pregnant with useful enactments, and that often when the public at large fancy the two Houses to be doing lierally nothing they are more buily engaged than is commonly the case with necessary reforms And practically important legtslation. Too many of us judge of the good done in a sesson by the elonuence of the speakers, the magmtude of the questiens discussed, or the liveUness of the incdents occur. ring during debate. We watch not so much the progress of Bills as the piquaucy of rhetorical sallies; our attention is directed away from the success of a long-desired change of the law by an enthusiastically-received oration or a well-reported scene. And yet there are men in the House of Commons who havo done far more for the good of their country, who have been much more serviceable in the cause of useful legislation thau Mr. Gladstone with his amazing rhetoric and Mlr. Disraell with his sarcastic powers. Aye, and there aro measures which excited very little popular attention, the results of which have been more influential than those of Bils whose passage lashed into fury the waves of Great Britain's political sea. Having noticed with approbation the Scotch ineasures passed during the sesion, he rwent on to say:While speaking on the subject of Scotch legislation, I must, however, express my concurrence with those who complain that so little time was Last session given for the consideration of very important BiUls. The fact is, gentle. men, that the management of measures affecting Scotland only is not on a proper footing. I bAve the greatest esteem and regard for the present Lord Advcoate-I believe we nerer had a more efficient one-but I cannot help feeling that no Lord-Advocate can satisactorily perform the duties Imposed upon him as a judicial and political officer. One thing is certain,-thathecaunotbei two places at one and tho same time ; that It is rather too much to expect of a man to be in constant attendance in London when the Court is sitting and he bas causes to plead nburgh. Why, this very year Miss Smith's trial delayed the Scotch business before Parliament for a fortnight, and I think it well worthy of consideration whether or not an humble address should be moved to Her Majesty praying Her Majesty to take advantage of the first vacancy in the office of LordAdvocate to appoint an Under-Secretary of State who should take charge of and be responsible for Scotch measures in the Imperial Parliament. (Cheers.) There are only two more toplea discussed during last session on which, with your leave, I would say award. On tho 7th of July MIr. Boebuck moved a resolution to abolish the office of Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. As8 a friend of economy and responsible government, I, of course, gave this proposition my warmest support, and I deeply regret that only 115 members out of the great Liberal majority should have been found to vote for doing away with a system of sinecures beneilting no one but the tradesmen of Dublin; and when told, as I have been on excellent authority, that the leaders of al parties really do not approve this useless pageant, I feel humiliated to find that 266 members, including many Liberals, recorded their suffrages in its favour. I characterized the office as useless, and, if this be the case, seeing it costs the country annually a large sum of money, it ought to be abolished; but Is it not worse than useless ? Have not many excellent measures been baulked ? have not even efficient Seoretaries for Ireland been foreed to resn in consequeneo of backstair influence in Dublin Castle? This is freely stated among politicians who ought to know something about the matter, and I do hope that no electioneering considerations will prevent a liberal Government removing this obstacle to tbo progress of Ireland. You are awrare that I have always voted in favour of admitting Jews into Parliament. As an advocate of civil and religious liberty I can recognize no distinction of creed as affecting political rights; but you must not be surprised if, however anxious I am to see this last sbred of exclusiveness removed, I refuse to concur in any course which does not rocognize the right of the House of Lords to be consulted, kwd which may involve the House of Commons in an unseemly oontest with the courts of low. By sending up so many Bills on the subject to the Upper House we have virtuallyadmitted their claim to a veto, and, though it is rather unusual certainly for them to persevere in throwing out a measure passed by such large majorities in the Commons, I, for one, have great confidence in their Lordships' patriotism and in their arriving before long at a more liberal and wiser decision. At all events, I do not consider the matter of such importance as to justify a conflict of doubtful merits between the representatives of the people and the peers, Nelther did I concur in the eourse adopted by Lord John Russell towards the close of last session, when he introducod a second Bill into the Commons having the same object in view. This, it humbly appears to me, was hardly constitutional, and, although out of courtesy I voted for leave to bring It in, I had quite made up my mind to vote with the Conservative party had it been pressed to a second reading. And now I daresay you are ready to inquire what about the Reform Bill. It is a question very difEicult to answer. You know as much as I do about the necessity for it, the state of feeling throughout the country in regard to it, and the chances of its success. All I can say is that, although no doubt there is a time and place for everything, and although, if the state of our Indian possessions be such as to demand much of the attention of Parliament it would be folly to endanger them to discuss poUtical changes, still I do not believe that any professed Liberal Administration can remain long in power unless it keeps pace with the rapidly-growving inteligeonce of the people, and bheads every movement for gradual and judicious reform. (Cheers.) Lord Palmerston is publicly pledged next year to bring i a measure, and, unlass events in the East cause a genera aoquiescence in Its further postponement, I am not suspicious enough to imagine that the word of promise will not be kept. I hope it wiU include a further revision and improviment of the represensation of small boroughs, the disfranmhisement of some, the taking away of one member from others, and granting of additional members to great towns ,of comparatively reent origin which have not their fair share in the government of the country. And as far as Scotland at least is concerned I feel assured that the reduction of the franchise to SI. would give us a more inteligent and more independent constituency than we have at present, for there is no class of men better informed on political subjects and less nuder influenoe than the more skUled workmen employed in maechanical labour. Perhaps they have on the whole more political knowlege than the shopkeepers. At all events, I would gladly welcome them to the voters' list. Permit me, gentlemen, to make one or two observations befo:e sitting dowvn on thoe lamentble oocurrenoes whlh have taken plabe In British India, monopoliring public at. tentlon, throwing for the time into the shade every other topic, taklng the oountry by surprise, exciting the nationa spint to a pitch not witnesed for many years before, and, als filling not a few households with desolation and woe. It would be the ight of prmption in me were I to do matize as to the oaues of this revolt or the mosures tobe taken first to put it down and then to restore confidence and good government In that great empire. My object now is merely to call your attention to two or three points which must shortly be discussed, and which it isverynece that we should all study with deliberation nd impartLa care. The first question which ill naturally be asked when Parliament reassmbles is, was no warnlng ever siveu of what km taken plaoes; among the numerous nd gifted civil and military servant of the Company were there none far-seeing enough to predict the gathering storm? I am afraid the officials of Cannon-row and Leadenhall-set will find it difricult to persuade the Legilature and the public to accept of a negative answer to queries which involve culja biity andneglect I will not say with Mr. Disraeli that the counclors of the Governor-General hAve by their conceit and arrogance endangered the Indian empire; but I amprepred to join those who will *sk them Dd Lord Mete lfe, refernng to the oondition of the Bengal s.,Xra eay 'I fear we shall wake no some fine morning and find tha Her Majeety has lost fndi. Were native new pers contaning noticee of wide-spread disaffection laid before the council or 1856? Did the late lamented General Anson never cease to represent to the directors the dan er to be prehended fromtheSepo s9 Did Lord Melville when he returned home in 1850 (I qaote his own words in the House of Lords) express the greatest disapprobation of the condi. tion of the Bengal troops, and was'he told really not to publish his sentiments lest fore'gn nations should he acqainted with the state of asfis!? Iir C. Napier correct In stating that in 1849 *a mutinous spirit pervaded some 30 Sepoy battalions in march for, or actually emnloved in, the Punjab?' Did not he, in a work published in 1853, say," t[atiny with the Sepoya is the most formidable danger menacing our Indian empire-a danger that may come unexpectedly, and, if the first symptoms be not carefullytreated with a power to shake LeadeniUl-street ? Did the BinGa Sepoy6 mutinzin. Scinde? In 1849 wa6 the same spirit rampant in Delhi ? Were 20 regiments then discovered to beiinfected? Did Sir C .Napler ste on his arrival in India to assume the chief command, that "he found the seeds of mutinysownin a large proportionofthenativearmy? These are questions not to be hstily answered, as they contain serious chages; bht you will at onoe see that they call for the faullest an most searching inquiry on the part of the representatives of the people. If, however there be the slightest trath in sacl statements, it L rather too much for gentlemen connected with the India-house to tell us that the want of common forbearance and knowledge of the natives displayed in compelling them to use gresd ctridges was the cause of the outbreak-cartridges which, by the way, the same couscientious soldiers have no scruple in using against their European officers. (Hear, hear.) Gentlemen, I believe with a " taff Officer," who writes mnoet admirably on the subject, that the ing was a fusslman plot aided by the Brahmis and 1 think, judgng at les from his acts, that Lord Can. ning has no doubt of the existence of a great and general conspiracy for overthrowing British power. We shall likewise have shortly to inquivr whether this spirit was 'not fostered by what Sir C. Napler calls the over-petting and over-paying of the Sepoys. Even Mr. Mangles, chairman of the Company, admitted in his place in the House of Commons that they had been so much indulged that their disCpline had been affected, and Colonel Jacob has told us stories of how they were pampered which are almost incredible. The same "StaffOffioee" to whom I have allIded likewise writes in the most indignant style "of Government encouraging the Sepoys to dictate, to complain of their officers, to magnify preindioes, and invent griev, ances." The next subject which demands our notice is the attitude of the Government towards religion, and already some feeble attempts have been made by those who have friends to screen to throw the blame on Christffm -g efforts and the missionaries. What says the "Staff Offioer' on this point? "What hu encouraged the revolt? ImPlacable hatred to us as a nation-the timid policy of a Government who tolerate and cherish idolatry and Mahomedanism, and rather persecute their own religion." Mr. Hay, an intelligent American, and one of the refugees fronm Allahabad, writes,-" The Government relied upon keep. lng alive the ignorant prejudices of lindoos and Mahomedana, and preserving its authority by balancing race against race and religion against relon, and the mutiny shows that its scheme has signally failed. The missionary schools were twice as crowdedasM the Govemnment scheols. Inthe former the Bible and catechism wrere taught, and the schools commenced and ended with prayer. In the latter, until very recently, the Bible was excluded. The Koran and the Shaswer were ia the Government schools; but no professor was ever allowed, even if requested, to explain anything with reference to the Bible, not even as a historical book. Nearly all the native professors and graduates of theGovernmentUniversitiessnd schools were atheis6 Their education caused them to disbelieve paganism, and they were not enoouraged to believe in Christianity. Many of them are implicated in the present revolt." (Hear, hear.) Colonel Jacobs tells us that I the inoredible pretensions of the Bengal Sepoy in relation to caste are based, not upon the precepts of his religion at aUl, but simply upon his own subtle and designing policy," and in proof of this mentions the extnordinary fact that the Bombay army, whore such claims are tolerated, contains men from " the vary same villaes, the very samne fauilies, and the very same caste as tat of Bengal. Sir C. Napier narrates that in the 13th Native Infantry there were no fewer than 430 Brahmins. Looking at what has taken place, I ask you, in the words of another recent writer, should not "our future policy be an unbending, stern, and avowed discouragement of everything opposed to civilization, social morals, and British supremacy." (Cheers.) Again, the withdrawal of military officers to fill civiL situations-carried on systematicaUy, and to an extent scarcely credible-was sufficient of itself to destroy discipline. Sir C. Napier assigned this as one of his chief reasons fox resigning the command. No fewer than 443 officers of the Bengal army had at that time been thus withdrawn by the civil authonties, and it is well known that the cleverest and ablest men are generally selected, leaving the duU and the inexperienced to mane the troops. Then the soldiers were harassed by being made to do the duties of a police, which the Company ought long ago to have established on a proper footing, instead of which they thwarted Lord Eenborough and every one who tried to organize it. The discipline of an army is necessarily impaired when its men are draughted off to coUect tasxes, carry letters, guard magistrates, and put down petty street rows. Parliament then, gentlemen, after all the causes of this fearful outbreak have been investigated and the real culprits exposed, will be caUed on to provide for the reorganisation of the native army, for it is utterly impossible to hold India with British troops alone, to consider the requisite augmentation of the European force, and, regarding as wel the danger to be apprehended from internal commotions as that likely to rLse from hostility on the part of the Mahratta States of Ava, Affghanistan, and Nepaul, to make arrangements for the defence of the empire. In doing so I hope they wLil not forget to urge on Government the necessity of stationing a sufficiency of gunboats on the Ganges, the Indus, and their tributary streams. Biit the great question wiU be the oontinued existence of the East India Company; whether that mercantile oligarchy should be held as scarcely responsible for any of the evils admitted to exist, and therefore permitted to oontinue its influence or poHlcy; or whether, in consideration of the growing feeling even in Calcutta itself, as indicated by the unanimously passed resolution of a public meeting and the widespread sentiment at home, it should be condemned as effete and inefficient, and India be brought into mora immediate oonnexion with the British Crown. (Cheers.) We have three or four years at least of arduous and severe work before us, we have to crush with a high hand one of the greatest revolts in history, we bave to reform the government of 200,000,000 of men but I rejoice to think that the Indian army possesses men fitted for the crisis, whose cool heads and admirable judgment have already saved an empire, whose deeds of chivalry and daring rival the grandest exploits in the historic page. The marshes and the despatches of Havelock remind us of the earliest days of Roman achievement; at Agra, at Luck-now, and at Arrah you hava bands of Englishmen who have heart and hand to hold any ThermopyLe, and Horatins Cocles on the Subliceax bridge, holding the Etrurian army at bay, displayed no sublimerspectale of beroin bearing than did Captain Skene and others of our countrymen who fought like lions against overpowering numbers, whose valour has produced an effect in Asia scarcely to be effaced by time. (Cheers.) A vote of thanks was cordially Passed to Mr. Baxter for his ablo and independent servioes and the meeting separated, The hon. member also addressed his constituents at Forfar on similar topics, and ias cordially received.
TO THE EDITOR OF THB TIMES. Sir,-Your correspondent, "A Civilian," has an ercellent letter in T7hc Tmes of to-dav, on the subject of General Lloyd and his conduct at Mserut. He thinks it rather hard to try an officer, possibly of some previous merit, by a court-martial, simply for over-estimating his ow-n capa. biUities at 70 years of age. Most people wil agree with him, both in this and in thinking that those who made the appointment, or who suffered it to continue, are by far the most culpable. It is a delicate subject to handle in the press, but if " A Civilian" will turn his attention nearer home than India he will find that there are officers con. nected with one or other of our military departments not merely 70 years of age, but closely verging upon or exceeding some eight or ten years older. He wiUl find them hold. ing appointments of the utmost import3nce to our mUitary interests and efficiency, and discharging duties which, adequately performed, would be presumed to require no very trifling activity and energy, both of mind and body. I should not li-e to indicate more definitely the quarter I allude to by stating the number of years during which at least one of theso appointments has been held by the same person. It Is sufficient to say that if, with very aged men at the head of any important part of our military affairs, we hope to keep pace with the younger blood of oontinental Powers, or to carry out thoso every-day improve. ments in our armaments which are continually suggested& we shall most probably be disappointed.

TOM B'R(IVN'S SCHOOL iDA YS. (Third Edition,) - .0. The tale before us belongs to ' 'uIass wrmtten for boy; but intended to be read by men. The doaU moralizing tone and forced -expression common in such books generallyrender themmequally unpalatable to both ages. The difliculty, however, of reading a bad boy's book is far exceeded by that of writing a goo(i one. When a grown man sits down to recall his own school experiences, he finds the gulf between his present and his past feelings greater than that -which divides the Feudal or Elizabethan period from otir own. He may dwell fondly on the heroic days of boyhood, but his sympathy is the self-conswous sympathy of retro*pective analysis. Few writers can throw themselves into the true old vein; even &Suadford aLd Merton is no exception ; added to wvhich its plot is laid at an earlier age and aMid less interesting circumstances than Twin BroWn's S vLhO Days. Toni Brown is a tough Wiltshire lad from the Yale of 'White Horse, which our author describes with a loving minuteness of geographical and historical detail familiar to us in the works of Mir. l;ingsby, from whom, too, he seems to have learnt the amusing habit of turning round whenever he makes a point, aud, as it were, challenging his readers to come on. In this vale Sqnire Brown, the father, "dealt out justice and mercy in a rough way, and begat sons and daughters, and hlnted the fox, and grumbled at the badness of the roads and the times." The opinion which the squire, though a high Tory, "loved to propound above all others w-as the belief that ax man is to be valued wholly and solely for that which he is in himself, for that which btands up in the four fleshly walls of him, apart from clothes, rank, fortune, and all externals whatsoever. Which belief I take to be a wholesome corrective of all political opinions, and, iflhald sincerely, to make all opinions equally harmless, -whether they be blue, red, or green." In conformity -with this Carlylesque dreed Tom was confided chiefly to the charge of a veteran village bruiser, -who instructed him, as Chiron did Achilles, in those athletic exercises which the " muscular Christianity" of this school of writers treats as alhnost necessary to salvation. Being a hearty boisterous kind of boy he soon rivalled the young rustic bullies, who in this neighbourhood at least wore " fully as manly and honest, and certainly purer, than those in a higher rank." " Great was the grief among the village schoolboys wben Tom drove oir with the squire, one August morning, to meet the coach on his -way to school," that is, to a private school, with the regular apparatus of ushers, tell-tales, &-c. " Now, the theory of private schools is (or was) constant supervision out of school, therein differing fundamentally from that of public schools." It is in the latter that the author's heart and our sympathies are, and before six pages are over the squire breaks out- "My dear, I have arranged that Tom shall go to Rugbv at onceo for the last six weeks of this half-year, instead of wasting them, riding and loitering about town." Public school life must have been an inviting subject to a person of our author's turn of mind. It is hard to conceive a more sovereign prophylactic against the supposed evil tendencies of our times. Energy and courage, so often found wanting where they are most needed, are here developed into a positively dangerous predominance. "P Pluck," as our author's hero tells his comrade in a phraseology perfectly newv to us, "is the only thing after all that '11 -wash," in a society ruled by the highest animal spirits. A thoroughly Athenian freedom of speech prevails among those who a few years later will be among the adroite4t fencers of the Circuinlocution-oflice. High moral sentiments, so readily blurted forth in the great world by the heartless and hardened, are here whispered from friend to friend with an awkwvard baahfulnesa. So far English boys will not suffer from a comparison with English men; what the set-off against this attractive simplicity is those only know who have themselves passed through the lower forms of our public schools. Parents may -well abstain from looking too closely into the process and content themselves -snth the results. The marvel is, not that so many fall, but that so few contract any permanent taint. Hlow those fierce passions are tamed, how the license of unbridled speech ls softened into courtesy, how lawlessness becomes discipline, how false morality gives place to a sound and manly sense of right, and all this 'within two or three years, with little external assistance, and without any strong religious impreasions, is an unsolved problem. Meanwhile, we hail this little work as the truest, liveliest, and most sympathizing description of an iunique phase of English life that has yet been given to the public. Rugby holds a somewhat peculiar position among the great English schools partly due to the diflerent Character of its matcrial4 ,ttd partly to the fact of its having so recently phased under a master hand. The high position so readily accorled to them by their compeers does not yet sit quite easily on Rugbeans, and, like our Transatlantic brethren, they sometimes betray themselves to be citizens of a new country. We believe that some of our readers will not approach without certain apprehensions a story the scene of which is laid in Rugby under Dr. Arnold. The model Rugby sixth-form boys were apt to regard therAselves as members of a semipolitical, semi-sacerdotal fraternity; they exhibited an inclination to extend the monitorial system to the world, and to walk through the TJniversity at least as they did through Rugby, " with their canes," and " caUling out, ' Silence, silence !'" Their contemporaries amused theraselves with their obtrusive self- consciousness, their oppressive sense of responsibility, their conscientious tendency to entangle themselves in theological difficulties of the second magnitude, and their nervous anxiety to look after other people's moral welfare. It is but justice to say that these foibles have i; great part worn away as the merits of Rugby hlave become more and more recognized, and that Toir lBrow"n's Schwol Days is in general neither over didactie nor intensely Rugbean. WVe do not, however, altogether escape the censornous lash. The following remarks are supposed to be addressed by Dr. Arnold to a " model young master," who plays a part like that of the 44 messenger" in a Greek tragedy:- " A gross case of buUying. Wharton, the Head of the House, is a very good fellow, hut slight and weak, and severe physical pai is tae only way to deal with such a case; so I ave asked Holmes to take it up. He is very careful and trustworthy, and has plenty of strength. I wish all the sxth had as much. We must bave it here, if we &re to keep order at aL. tIaei ee fw r oke The author proceeds:- " Now, I don't want any wiseacres to read this book, but, if they should, of couirse they will prick up their long ears .and howl, or rather bray, at the above story." This is really too bad. We are not disposed to -quarrel with Dr. Arnold's course in this particular case, but the r-exta qmustio of monitorial thrashings is not to be disposed of by such unreasoning backhanders as this; and we take leave to express downright incredulity when w'e are told that " years afterwards that boy sought out Holmes and thanked him, saying it had been the kindest act vwhich had ever been done upon (sic) him, and theturning point in his character." The question always begged in declamation of this kind is whether by any means 'wisdom can be united with power in the persons of these sixth-form, whose moral elevation, be it remembered, is and must be attained not by mnoral superiority (which there is no method of testing), 4iut by a mrere intellectual contest. In fact, in another place, our author thus describes the state of -the schoolhouse at a particulai time:- "M Matters wero not so comfortable either in the house as thaey had been, for old Brooke left at Christmas, and one or two others of the sLxth-form boys at the following Easter. Their rule had been rough, but strong and just In the main, and a biher standard was begnning to be set up; in fact, there had been a short foretaste of the good time which followed some years later. Just now, however, all threatened to return into darkness and chaos again, for the new prepostors were either small youn boys whose cleverness had carried them up to the top of the school, while in strength of body and chazractr"-as if these always went together" they were not yet fit for a share in the government; or else big fellows of the wrong sort-boys -whose friendship and tastes had a downrward tendency, who had not caught the meaning of their position and work, and felt none of its responsibilities. So under this no-government the schoolhouse began to see bad times. The big fifth-form boys, -who were a sporting and drinking set, soon began to usurp power, and to fag the little boys as if they were prupostors, and to bully and oppress any who showed sign of resistance. The bigger sort of sixth-form boys just described soon made common cause with the fifth, while the smaller sort, hampered by their olleagues' desertion to the enemy, could not make hesd against them." The " Old Boy" dilates at some length on the evil deeds of these fifth-form boys, for whom he evinces a contempt that amuses us vastly, seeing that from this despised body full-blown sixth-form are turned out within a few months, as sure a8 Prince Hal and Henry V. were one and the same person. For our own part, we think the merits aDd defects of the Rugby system prettv evenly balanced, Ps tX WT rulxs themAelve3, Sonc boys, no doubt, 1 econie overbearing or opinionated, au evil aggravated by the close oligarchialspirit of the governirg class; in others responcsibility produces sefrespecG and conscientiousness. Probably the inxferior orders in a school such as Rugby benefit on the whole by I the superintendence. l But to return to the story. A drive by the Tally-ho coach (a capital piece of description) brings Tom to Rugby, where he fall into The games and traditions of the place with an ease that most of u s should have envied. East, a boy whom he! " knows at home," puts him up to everything, he diatinguishes himself by his pluck at football on hiz very first day, and is marked out by destiny as the future sucoessor of Old Brooke, the school hero of the time, whose deeds in the schoolhouse match read like a book of Romer. We must protest, by the way, against the short-sighted plan of making games compulsory, not only because pleasures should not be tortured into pains, but also because, notwithstanding the assurance that " the rest of the sixth form go forward into the close to 8ee that no one escapes by any of the side gates," we are fully persuaded that more do actually escape by dodges or excuses under this foolish system than voluntarily absent themselves, where, as at Eton, attendance is purely optional. C Old Brooke's speech on leaving is a choice specimen of school-boy eloquence. We give an extract:- "- Gentlemen of the Sohoolhouse,-I am very proud of the way In which you have received my name, and I wish I could say all I should like in return; but I know I shan't. However, I'll do the best I can to say what seems to me ought to be said by a follow who's just going to leaIe, and who has spent a good slice of his life eva.s Eightyears it is, and eight such years as I can never hope to have again. So now I hope you'll all listen to me (loud cries of 'Tbat pve will'); fto I am going to talk seriously. You're| hound to listen to me, for what's the use of caing me ' pater' and all that if you won't mind what I say? And I am going to talk seriously because I feel so. It's a jolly time, too, getting to the end of the half and a goal kicked by us first day (tremendous appiause), after one of the hardest and fiercest day's play I can remember in eight years. (Frantic xhoutiDgs.) The stbool pth yed splendidly too, I will say, and kept it up to tho last. Tbat last charge of theirs would bave carried away a house. I never thought to see anything aPin of old Crab there, except little pieces, when I saw hiim tumbled over by it. (Laughter and shouting, and great slapping on the back of Jones by the boys nearest him.) Wll but we beat 'em. (Cheers.) Aye, but why did we beat em ? Answer me that. (Shouts of ' Your play.') Nonsense. 'Twasant the wind and kick-off either, that would'nt do it. 'Twasnt becaase we've half.a. dozen of the best players in the school, as we have. I wouldn't change Warner and Hedge, and Crab, and the young 'un for any six on their side. (Violent cheers.) Bat half-a-dozen fellows can't keep it up for two hours against 200. Why is it, then? 'll teil you whbat I think. It's becanse we've more reliance on one another, more of a house feeling, more fellowship than the school can have. Each of us knows and can depend on his next-hand man betterthat's why we beat 'em to-da. We've union, they've division-there's the secret. (Cheers.) But how's this to be kept up? How is it to be improved? That's the question. For, I take it, we are all in earnest about beating the school, whatever else we care about. I know I'd sooner win two sehoolhouse matches running than get the Balliol Scholarshi any day. (Frantic cheers.)" Trideed, scholarship throughout this little volume is kept quite in the background. Gray, who has actually gaineed the distinction in question, is one of the m9thrperson,c of the drama, and Tom himself is a hero, not of the intelectual, but of the ablebodied kind. After inveighing very sensibly against buUying, Brooke proceeds to declare in favour of Arnold, whose authority at this time seems to have been far from established. He recommends them to know their man before rebelling. " And mind, now, I say again, look out for squalls, if you will go your own way, and that way ain't the Doctor's, or it'll lead to grief." Notwithstanding which weighty advice, backed by his own great popularity, he has to resort to the toast of " The dear old schoolhouse -the best house of the beet school in England," tou make his speech go down. The struggles of Tom Brown, as one of the rankand-file of Rugby, occupy the bulk of the book, and are very amusingly handled. From the first he shows so much pluck, and is so cheerful and sociable, that we cannot help charging our author with an error in selecting him as a victim of buUying. Boys like Tom and East, who so soon after " were noted as some of the toughest fags in the school," are just the last who would suffer in this way. The pleasure of inflicting wanton pain depends on the sensitiveness of its object, and a feUow who is wilUingly tossed in a blanket his first night, and runs in " big-side hare-and-hounds" his first quarter, is not one into whose eyes a Flashnan (a very Nena Sahib in cowardly ferocity) can readily bring tears by "saying cutting and cruel things," still less wvho would be half roasted for not selling a lottery-ticket. The letter incident, even as qualifed by the writer, who tells us that " such scenes are not possible now at school," certainly qtrikes us as most improbable, less in its barbarity than in the dishonesty of the avowed motive. But Tora's feelings on the following morning are truly and pathetically told :- At first he feels broken, and thinks of writing home 1 and getting taken away; and the verse of a hymn he had learnt years ago sings through his head, and he goes to sleep murmuring,- Where the wicked cease from troublng, and the weary are at leat.' But after a sound night's rest the old bcy-spirit comes back again. East comesa reporting that the wholo house is with him, and he forgets everthing but their old resolve, never to be beaten by that bully Flashman." At this point of his career the hero sustais two' distinct, but not inconsistent, characters. He is the champion of the fags against the unrighteous tyranny of the fifth form, while he is getting into perpetual scrapes, and has " been flogged several times in the half-year for wilful and repeated breaches of rules." This leads to the crisis, the threat of expulsion, and the wise expedient by which Arnold, hitherto known to Tom only as a stern ruler, succeeds in reclaiming him. "The first sermon from the Doctor" had already impressed him greatly, " Jlforo worthy peas than mcine have described that soene. The oak pulpit standing out by itself above the school seats; the tall gallant form, the kindling eye, the voice now soft as the low notes of a flute, now clear aud stirring as the call of the light infantry bugle, of hbn who stood there Sunday after Sunday, witnessing and pleading for his Lord, the lung of righteousness, and love and glory, with whose spirit he was filled, and in whose power he spoke. The long lnes of young feces rising tier above tier down the whole length of the chapel, from the Uttle boy's who had just left hiq niother to the young man's who was going out next week into the great woald rejoicing in his strength. It was a great and solemn sdght, and never more so than at this time of year, when the only lights in the chapel were in the pulpit and at the seats of the prnenostors of the week, and the soft twilight stole over the rest of the ohapel, deepening into darkness in the high gallery behind the organ." Then follows a noble passage on the nature of Arnold's influence over characters such as Tom, respecting whom " it was more than doubtful whether he would get good or evil from the school." The scale was turned by a boy named Arthur, of delicate health and gentle disposition, but endowed vwith a rare strength of mind and religious principle, who was now placed by Dr. Arnold under Tom's care in the belief that the contact of characters so dissimilar would prove a lasting benefit to both. The author has devoted his best powers to the delineation of this schoolboy friendship, and we believe he has shown true insight in so doing. It is in the affections and chivalrous feelings of boyhood that the true antidote is to be found to the rude and selfish violence which characterizes all masses where reciprocal duties are not clearly defined. Nothing but the difficulties arising from the neglect of the whole nature except the brains has suggested the notable policy of dismissing as incurable those who are above all the proper subjects of public-school education. The author feels well the effect on his hero of his relation to gOUng Arthur: sIt increased his sense of zesponsibility, and though he hadn't reasoned it out and made it clear to himself, yet somehow he knew that this responsibUity, this trust be had taken on hin without thinking about it, head over beels In fact, was the centre and turning-point of his school life, that whlch was to make him or to mar him; his appointed work and trial for the tilno being." Of course, Toni Brown has a fight, and, as might have been expected, it is on Arthur's behalf. We are not inclined to be particularly squeamish about fights between schoolboy. Their causes are not more frivolous than those of many European wars; no bones are broken, and they end, after a proper amount of pommeling, in a very healthy cooling of passions. We should therefore have accepted this part of the story, especially as it is so well told, without the hostility against which the writer so elaborately guards himself. But when we are gravely told that " from the cradle to the grave fighting, rightly understood, is the business-the real, highest, honestest business of every son oj man;" that " every one who is worth his salt has his enemies who must be beaten, be they evil thoughts and habits in himself, -or spiritual wickedness in high places, or Russians, or border-ruffians, or Bill, Tomn, or Harry, who will not let him live his life in quiet till he has thrashed them, &c.," we cannot buregret that everything high and holy should be in4 voked to the aid of the vulgar instinct of pugnacity, and that what Christianity commands should be so recklessly confounded with that which it prohibits. The later part of Toi's Rugby careez does not occupy the space which it usually fills in tho recdllootion of " old boys." We find him ca4ontat of tho eleven, and as such assigning to Arthutr it iFlia(x which he admits to be due less to tho p-owetss tof thilt htiro) than to his own ratithde, whilto hti '114t lloy with the same ' model yoIUng in1otor' W llmv appears on the cricket-field, anid, tsrtirWg tfrom t. somewhat inopportune allumton to thu l,iasIr of A ritstophanes, launches into 7a convorsatitoin w:h'olii thew loose threads of Trom's selool existeto as e gat!throd up into the shape of a cohorenut jwrpono, f',rinm and executed by the great hoad miaster. Il'o Ilit chapter of tho book containn n very toclhg i(ig doscription of the inmpression produce(d on 'I'om, novw a member of an Oxford reading party, by thio iteilligence of Dr. Arnold's death which awply rodocina it from the charge of want o axrt volunteuerd by tho author. Where there are so much vigour of thouglht anI felicity of expression it may s3%m an ungratcious task to criticize style. Ve cannot, however, refrain from noticing a somewhat slovenly use of language, and a not unkreqaent disregard of the exigoncios of grammar. We think the atuthor has done well in not seasoning the conversation of his schoolboys with the grosser badinage common in sulch discourses. But we question whether DOys unversed in certain modern writers would have talked so glibly of " a respectable public," or have developed the theory that "m most right things" are " got by proper compromises." We wish, too, we could believe that non-attendance on the Sacrament was likely to be a cause of schoolboy unpopularity, or that there was no room in the schoolhouse in which it did not become the regular custom for boys to say their prayers. It is difficult to estimate the amount of good which may be done by Tom Brow'es &hool -Days. It gives in the main a most faithful and interesting pictture of our public schools, the most English institutions in England, and which educate the beat and most powerful elements in our upper classes. It opens out from the schoolboy point of view a new aspect of Dr. Arnold's character-that character which has already fiurnished the materials for one of the best pieces of biography of our days. But it is more than this; it is an attempt, a very noble and successful attempt, to Christianize the soicety of our youth through the only practicable channel-a hearty and brotherly sympathy with their feelings; a book, in short, which an English father might well wish to see in the hands of his son.
TRANSPORT OF TROOPS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your leading artiole of the 5th of October informs the public that the European army in India is to consist, a few months her e, of 85,000 inc. This army must be recruited from Europe. Our Royal army in India has hitherto consisted of from 24 to 26 battalions of infantry, entered in the Arnmy List as on the Indian establishment, and is commonly understood to have been about 20 battalions effective in the ierritory of the East India Company, and may be deemed iit round numbers to have hitherto a nounted to between 18,100 and 20,000 men ctualUy in India, iacluding in that nua ber four regiments of light cavalry. The reliefs sent out to this force during the last five years (which have been omnparatively easy years when contrasted with those in whi-.h were the wars of the Punjih and of Affghanistan) have Averaged a rate of 9 per cent. per annum upon the above number. The European troops have hitherto been placed as much as possible in the most healthy quarters in India, and it is not likely that the future condition of the troops wiU ba ameliorated as affecting the extent of their relefs, but, on the contrary the percentage of reliefs is likely rather to be increased, and it would not be prudent to calculate on less than 8,000 muen required annually to be passed for an average distance of 13,000 miles by sea between Europe and various parts of India to replace the casualties of the abovestated army. This service will be independent of our reliefs in the Mediterranean, in South Africa, in the islands east of the Cape, in China, in Australia and New Zealand, in North America, and in the West Indies, and independent of those constant changes of battalions, squadrons, and detachments of Artillery with their guns, as well aS of infantry, which are constantly requiring sea transport between the various insular stations of Great Britain. We have organized a land transport (now called " Military Train") service, owing to the wretched plight in which we found ourselves for want of such a service, and we have put off till the latest moment,and no doubt shall continue to put off still later, a Mlle organization of marine transport. sy object is to draw attention to the propriety or rather to the necessity of such latter service. Our troops lately sent to India have been sent pilc-m&lc, helterskelter, without any arrangement other than such as arose out of the class or description of vessel reported day by day by the East India Compsny to the aorse Guards as to be ready at a certain date for conveyance of troops. The consequence of this has been that battalions of only 800 men have teen divided into three portions, the last portion sailzg as much as a month later than the first, the headquarters generally being the last to embark, having beon unable to oomplete and send off their voluminous returns on pa per (another cancer In our present system) untU after the other portions of the battalion had sailed. One striking instance of the same malarrangement comes to memory which occurred during the Crimean war, when a cavalry regiment was disorganized and inefficient for months owing to the loss of its head-quarters ship, without which its hind quarters could do nothing; and numerous cases of like effect might be quoted. l iewing theme circumstances, it would seem that the time has arrived when there may be some hope of drawing public attention to the subject of an efficient marine transport, to form part of the ordinary armament of England. Let us concede the prejudice which for at least 70 years has pervaded the Itoyal navy, to the effect that men-of-war are not to be converted into troopships. Conceding this, the i marine transports should be ships constructed and fitted for the purposes of the three arms of the land service, and should be commanded by masters of the Royal navy, with a proper establishment. Four of these transports, at the least, should be constructed or procured of a class capable of taldng each a brigade of infantry (three battalions and staff) or a regiment of cavalry, with its horses. Eight more at the least should be constructed or procared, capable of taking each a battalion of infantry, or a battery of artillery(six guns), with all their matserict. Four more at leat should be procured, of a class capable of taking de. tachraents, such as are usually sent about for change of quarters, or for reliefs to our nearest stations. Even with this transport fleet of 16 vessels, and allowing four more as a reserve, or, in all, 20 vessels -all being, of course, screw steamers,-we should, no doubt, have to hire occasionally from the mercantile navy. Bet the efficiency of our forces would be materially increased; much time would be saved in having vessels always at land; the health of our troops would be amended ; the expenditure by deaths and sickness would be lessened as wel by amended transport as by more frequent reliefs; and if the expense of the casual transport hired during the last five years be summed up and contrasted with the permanent expense of such a fleet as that above described, maintained during five years, we shall also be gainers on that sore point of the British Government-the phantom of expense. Trusting that this outline may draw attention to the srbject and excite discussion among those able to deal practically with the question, I remain, Sir, Your obedient servant. AN OLb Q.-ML.G. London, Oct. 7.
ALLEGED CAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OP GROUSE.- The scarcity of grouse in the west of Scotland this season has been chiefly caused by an extensive system of netting the eoveys, not for the market, but for conveyanee to those moors in the naorth which were thinned by disezse. The net, which can cover a large portion of ground, and is so fine that it can be carried in the poeket or hat, is spread over the heather when the dog points, and the birds that rise are taken. This accounts for what has frequently been observed by sportsmen in the WestHighlands this season-viz.,yotung broods unaccompanied by the old birds, as the "cheepers" are unable to rise, and thus escape the net. It is also the reason -why so few grouse have appeared in the market, as the poachers are better paid for live birds than dead game.- G*reenock Advertieer. [Advertisement.]-The Rev. C. H.

They are heavier than the heavy cavalry of any continental nation, and neither the men nor their antrm are of the description required by that particular braneh of tho sorvice. ln the first place let us consider the use that light cavalry should be put to, and then the descriptions of men and armDs required. 1. Otitpont duty of aU kinds; outlying and inlying pickets. 2. All reconnaissancee and surveysof the country, in which they should gather every information of the movements of tho enomy. 3. Light cavalry should hover round tho army when It is In the lield, protecting it from surprise or false alarms (a horrid imuisance to the soldier), and preventlng the enemy fron mnaking any reconnaissances of the numbers or positlon. 4. Light cavalry should he employed to forage and gather In everything that might be uSful to the army, and destroy all that might benefit the enemy. 5. The baggage of the army, CODvoys, escorts of tresmure prisoners, or munitions of war should be confided to light cavalry, 6. lhey should be employed in preserving the commumications of the army and cutting off those of the enemy. 7. In the field they should be employed in duties exclusitely belonging to light troops. They should harass the enemy as much as posslble at all times, cutting off aU stragglers and convoys, alloing them no rest, and keeping them in a state of constant alarm. 8. They should mask any movement of the army, should it be required. 9, They should be employed in aU duties of their particular arm, and by this means the heAvy cavalry would be reserved, with their chargers, fresh for the day of battle, when the weight of man and horse would tell to advantage in the charge and the shock. 10. In action their duties should be, seizing with celerity such positions as might be deemed advisablo to hold until the arrival of the Infantry; in protecting the flanks and rear of the army; in cutting up disordered iafantry or cavalry; in securing guns or prisoners, and taking every advantage that the action might have afforded in pursuing the enemy and preventing them from raUying, or in protecting a retreat. Now, to describe my beau ideal of a light cavalry trooper. Height, from 5ft. 4in. to 5fft. 8in. Thousands of line young fellows of this description might be got at the precent time in England; and ask any medinl man if he has not seen more symmetrical Sfgures of this height and men more capable of bearing fatigue than their taUer brethren. Their 'weight should not average more than nine stone. Tall men are not required for light cavalry, and where there is length there is weZght; and who, if he would win a rzce, or want to get over a long journey quickly, would overload his horse ? Ask any member of the Jookey Club, and he will tell you that be can handicap or weight a thoroughbred racer so that an ass would beat him In a long run. Then why have heavy horsemen in light cavalry regiments9 The average weight that the trooper of our so-caUed light cavalry regiments rides is about 19 stone. A light horseman, mounted for servioe in the field, should not exceed 11 stone, with arms and equipment. In heavy marching order, when he should carry a small tent like that of the Zouaves, and food for himself and horse, it might be a little more. Regiments of this description would not only be able to make forced marcher in much shorter time than those on the present system, but they would not break down their horses and would get twice the work out of them. I shall now give a slight description of the equipment and a] ms of the light horseman as he should be. The horses of our present light cavalry regiments are grod for an European climate, but they are too much pamIered, and rendered unfit for much hard work and exposure ie the field. The light horseman's charger should be swift, hardy, and enduring, and he should be taught to obey his rider from love rather than from fear. The horse Is very sagacious, and soon ascertaSns whether his rider is likely to be his friend or his foe, and he behaves accordingly. It is of great advantage to the light cavalry trooper to be on friendly terms with his horse. No horses in the world are better suited for light cavalry than the Arab of India, or the stud breed, producedl from MIahratta mares and Arab sires. Their endurance and ha diness is something wonderfulL The light horseman should be provided with the saddle invented bythe late Captain Nolan,having a leathern wallet on one (the near) side to hold spare ammunition and food, and abolster oonetaning arevolver (which should havea spring on it so as to fix it to his belt when required) on the other. A bridle, which need not be taken off the horse's head when he h fed (meraly removing the bits being suffiCient). A breech-loading carbine on Lafancheur's principle, as simplified and brought to perfection by Lang, of Cookspurstreet. This 'weapon, which need not weigh more than seven pounds, can be loaded and fired with ease six times in a minute, 'while the horse is at a gallop, and carries to perfection, far exeeeding the present Enfield rifle, which an a fewn years wil be wht the old Brown Bess is to-day. A sharp cut and thrust sabre, with broad blades in a 'wooden scabbard, so as not to turn the edge or jingle; the best weapon for a trooper, be he heavy or light. A vaist belt to contain three dozen cartridges to fit either rifle or revolver, three dozen more beiDg carried in a tin case, 'which should fit at the bottom of the wallet of the saddle. The light horseman should be dressed in a short, loose green, brown, or French gray tunic, with breeches loose to the knee, but cut so as not to form creases or plaits irl the rear (Vide those of the Chasseurs d'Afrique), hessian boots, hunting spurs, and a leathern or felt helmet lined with steel bars. The one made by Garden and Sons is a com fortable light head-dress, will resist a sabre cut, and in unequalled for Indian wear. The light horseman should be trained to act on foot as well as in the saddle. He sbould be a good shot, and extra pay, say a penny per diem, should be given to marksmen of the first class. This is the Idnd of soldier now required for India, and half-a-dozen regiments of such Light Cavalry with a few troops of Horse Artillery would be able to scour the country, and cut up the mutineers before they knew where they vere. They only who have been in the field before thc enemy can fully appreciate tho immense services a few regiments of efficient light cavalry could at this moment render in the country about Delhi. Having seen the great disadvantages the British army .had ever to oontend against in the Crimea for want of a few regiments of light cavalrY, I tbink Government ought at once to embody a sufficient force of this very useful arra of the service, of which Her Majesty has not a single corps, for though English pluck and bulldog courage as displayed by our Infantry and heavy cavalry, gains the day, our generals are never able to take advantage of their victory for want of that arm so essential to the service,light cavalry. I am. Sir. vours faithfullvy . A. L.. Late a field officer of Light Cavalry.
EMBODIMENT OF THE MILATIA. TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Now that 10,000 more of the Militia are to be embodied, will you allow me to say a few words through your columns ia behalf of those regiments which were embodied during the late war, but whose serviees were limited to an attendance upon the taproom customers of those Bogifaces upon vrhom they happened to be biUeted ? Take, pour CxZempte, the regiment in which I hold a comMsion. We considered ourselves rather a orack corps. We volunteered for service in the Mediterranean. We gave a large proportion of volunteers to the army, many of whom, as the honours which were conferred upon them go to prove did good service before Sebastopol. We attained a high state of discipline; we mancouvred well and compactly; we were complimented more than once by the General commtnding the district on being " mLmber one" of the regiaents he had inspected. The conduct of our men in their quarters was admirable, and gained them the goodwil of the townsfolk. Hinc illcr Utchryrnus. We were i allowed to vegetate more tiana 1S long months in our county town, while our more troublesome neighbours, who were at sixes and sevens with the people upon whom they were quartered, were in a few days after the reoeipt by the Secrstary of State for War of a petition from the municipal authorities marched off either to the camp at the Curragh, to Aldershott, or to one of the finest garrisons in Great Britain, where they picked up an Idea of what real soldiering was. Meanwhile our officers and men wero onnuyls. Well they might be. Our first levy of recruits have within the last month or two completed their five years' service, but not a man has ever yet entered a barrack-room or had the advantage of a brigade field-day. These things ought not so to be. If there Is any desire on the part of those in authority to keep alive a military spirit throughout the country let a regiment of MllItia be embodied in each county; let the men see something of soldiering; let the tap of the drum resound throngh the hills and vaUeys of every part of the land, and plenty of men wiU be forthcoming. There is a proper spirit abroad if it were but encouraged. I have lately asked several strapping young feUows to enrol themselves in my county regiment, but their reply has invariably been," Is it going to be embodied? I do not want to fasten myself in a regiment which is not to be caUed out.' Above all, let there be nothing thatsmaeks of favouritistn in the seleotion of regiments for embodiment. Already tbings seem trending that way. Many of those regiments v,hich were so highly favoured during the late war are again nnder arms, while those which were kept so far in the background appear doomed again to bring up the rear. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant. AN OLD SOLDIER. Oct. 6.
CARLISLE CATHEDRAL.-We 8tated a week or two ago that the fine new organ in the Cathedral was about to be taken to pieces in order to be thoroughly cleaned. Mr. Wllis, the eminent builder and his assistants, have comn inenced the manipulation of the instrument, and are now busily engaged in removing the duLst which has accumulated in the pipes. It will probably be a month or five weeks before the work is fi.nshed. Nearly the whole of the dirt had entered the pipes during the restoration of the building and it will consequently be a long time before the organ wil again require cleaning. It is intended to apply hydraulic power to the beUows, but the present hand-power will stUIl De kept in reserve. There is to be a cistern eapable of holding 1,500 gallons of water, the daUy consumption being estimated at 500 gallons, so that there will be an ample reserve. The men are now engaged in laying the necessary pipes, the flags in the south aisle being taken np for the purpose. In the meantime the week-day service is con. ducted in St. Mary's Churoh, nud that on Sunday in the Cat,hedral,-Carlisk Egmj2;='.
COURT OF BIAVKRUPJcY, Bajehghaetstrcct Oct. 8. L R}E EDWVARI) EICARn -A (Bcform 2fr. Commnisiwo RVANA I 'lneo Dankrupt is dc1rihed as a win, merchant, of 25, College-hilL. His HONouR now gave judgment. He said, the granting of a certificate in this case was opposed on the ground that the bankrupt oommenced busnees, being insolvent to a very Isrge amount, without giving -any notioe of thbat fact to the persons from whon he obtained goods, and tha,in maintain. lng himself his wife, and family he expended the proceeds of the prrcnm es. Those facts were not disputed. He (the Commlssioner) could not discover that the bnkrupt really intended to trade, and he cotld not bep thinking that his object was to get discharged from his debts by a oertificate in bankruptcy. He regretted being obhied to sy that this was as bad a case as any that had come before him. He should have refosed the certificate altogether had It not been for the deciion of the Superior Court in the case of "Manico," 3 De Gex, McNaughten, and Gordon, 502 The present caee appeared to him to be ln rinciple the some s that, and ho should threfore suspend the certificate for two years, from 19th of May, 1857, without protection for six months, and to be of the third class. IN RE OOTCH MQD GOTCH. The bankrupts were bankers, oTrriers, &c. of Kettering. This was an examinAtion meeting. Mr. PLEws for the wipgnee asked for an adjournment, the accounts not being ready; and an adjournment was ordered to the 15th of December. There was an examinaition meeting in the case of C. Brangwin, junior, teadealer, of Greenwich. On the application of Mr. Chidley he passed.
MIDDLESEX ESSZONS, 2Wursday, Oct. 8. mu%Src AND MANIWTa .T-. The Cour sat to-day At Clerkenwell to hear and determine applicatione for lioenses for musio and for mudc and dancing, under the 25th George IL, cap. 36. The number of applications for the renewal of licenses for music only was 2 2; for music and dancltg, C3; new applications for music only, 95; and for the doublelicense for music and dancing,1. MIr. 2owUsll presdedL The cases of Oremorne Gardens and the Argyll Rooms, in which there is oppoDition, were fixed for Friday. In several cases where dancing entertainment bLd been given, the liense being for music only, the Court refused the renewal. George Reeve a ppled for the renewal of a music license for the premises Formerly known as the Linwood Gallery, but now called the Caf Chantant, in Leicester-square. Mr. BoDnXi opposed on behalf of the parochial authorltieL The complaint was that the pledge upon the faith of which the Court originally granted the license-viz., that the place should be closed at 11 o'clock at night-had been entirely disregarded, and music had been going on until 2 and 3 o'clock of a morning, to the great annoyance of the neighbourhood ; that it was open ou Sundays for music, and was the resort of low and immorsd characters. Mr. SLEIGH addressed the Bench in support of the appIication, but The license was refused. The CanL-x statod that It was entirely against the tenor of the license for a place to be opeu for public musical entertainment on a Sunday. Au applcation was made by Mr. BODi2z for the transfer of a license from Charles Cooper to William Palmer, In respect of the Adelaide Gallery Exhibition IXooms and Marionette Theatre, described as of Adelalde-street, West Strand. It was reported to the Court by Inspector Mitchel] under the direction of tbe Commissioners of olice, that the rooms in question had been used for "sparring" matches for the beneEt of pugilitst and an association they had formed; that upon such occasions characters of the worst description collected there or in the neighbourhood, and that robberies were of frequent occurrence. Afte: wome discussion the COURT granted the license upon rMx. Palmer's assurance thst the rooms should not again be let for any such purpose. The followring learned counsel were engaged in various cases :-Mr. Serjeaut Ballantine (who op~ the Cremorne license against Mr. Edwin James, Q.C.), Mr. Bodkin, M.r Cooper, Mr. Metoslfe, Mr. Sleigh, r. Ribton, Mr. Giffard, and Mr. Poland.
POLICE. AS1O0-11OUSL-JOhU Franklin and William Kerp, who had been remanded upon the char e of having feloniously forged and uttered a check for 27R. with intent to defraud the UInion Joint-Stock Bank, were on Tuesday agaia brought before the LORD AIAYOR for further examination. M1r. Johnston applied for a further remand, which was granted. Matthew Henry Benjamin, a young man formerly in the serviceof Mr. R. C. Morpeth, tobacco-broker, of 10, Fenchurch-street, was charged under the following circumstances : The prosecutor said,-The prisoner was clerk In mny service, and I intrttsted hint with money to pay for duties at the Oustom-house. On the 21st of July I gave him a check upon Messrs. Smith, Paynet and Smith for 7491. 3s. ld. He was to pay the whole of this sum to the Custom-house. I made inquiries, and found that only 6684 19s. 9d. had been paid, leaving a deficiency of 80l. 3s. 4d. Funneli (detective officer).-I apprehended the prisoner in Plough-yard, Shoreditch. I charged him with robbing his employer of 804. 4s. Hfe replied he was surry for it; tthat the shboutld plead guity to the charge, and give no fur- The prisoner, who It was stated had been for some time past keeping four women, was remanded. Yesterday Daniel Casey was brought before Mr. Alderman BALE, npon remand, charged with having stabbed Hugh SulLivan with a knife. Both prosecutor and prleoner are tailors living on the same landing of a house in Sussex-place, Leadenhall-street, anduthey had their heads almost entirely covered with adhesive plaster. At the former examination W. Turner, a city policeman said, that at about 10 o'clock on Sunday night last he was informed that a man had been stabbed in Sussex-place, and upon proceeding to a front room on the second floor f a house there he found the prosecutor, who was insensible and bleeding from three or four vwounds. Upon the prosecator coming to his senses he gave the prisoner into custody upon the charge of stabbing him with a knife The prosecutor, who until yesterday had been confined to his bed, said, that on the night in question, as he was about entering his room he heard the prisoner abusing his (prosecutor's) wife. This caused words between him and the prisoner, and the latter called out "Take this," at the same time pluging a clap knife into the back of the prosecutor. The knife went some distance into his body, and helost a great deal of blood. Ele called to his wife for assistance, and she immediately ran upstair3 and struck the prisoner repeatedly over the head with the leg of a chair. The prisoner was remanded, in order that the evidence of the medical man who dressed the prosecutor's wounds might be taken. MARLBOROUGH-STRIET.John Gardner, who had been out on bail, appeared before MIr. BLNOL,1m on the third examtnatimn,oharged with unlawfully intermarrying with Jane Bishop on the ll;th of June, 1847, at the Registrar'$-office, St. Jamess, a former wife being then living. Commritted for trial; bail in 160l. taken. MARYLEBoNE-Mr. William Dwyer, residing in Thayer street, Manchester-square, was charged before Mr. LoNG on a summons with having wilfully and naliciously done damage to the amount of 5C Mr. Woolf, from the office of Mr. Herring, attended for defendant. The evidence of the complainant, Matthews, went to show that on Wednesday, the 23d nlt., defendant got into his cab and ordered him to drive him to his residence and while on the road he observed him placing ais feet on the plush cushion, and in consequenoe he expostulated with and requested him to desist; he saw at the time that he had an open knife in his hand, and that he was cutting into the cushions, &c. Complainant took him home, where he alighted, and after a strutggle between them in reference to the mischief which he had done he forecd his way indoors. A large mob assembled owing to the confusion which ensued, and a woman whom he (complainant) saw at the house told him that if he would call next day any amount of damage should be made good. He did caU again but could not see defendant. He, therefore, took out a summnons. Cross-examined by Mr. Woolf.-The mob was not occasioned by defendant in the first instance refusing to pay his fare. I will swear that about 20 minutes before defenddent got into my cab I saw the cushions all right. I can't be mistaken about that. Mr. LozsG.-Was the defendant at all the worse for dlrink ? Complainant.-I think he was, Sir Police-constable Church, 66 D, produced one of the cab cushions, which had been slashed in all directions. Mr. Woolf said, that it was altogether a matter of credibility as to the complainant's testimony. He was not in a position to put his client in the box to give evidence upon oath, and he had no witness to contradict what complainant had sworn to. Defendant was fined 5U. for the damage, and s. costs. If any proof were wanting as to the manner in which the day of fasting and humiliation was observed in many parts of the densely populated district of Blarylebone, it may be stated that fewer charges of drunkenness and disorderly conduct were brought before the sitting magistrate yesterday than he has had to dispose of on any day for a long time. This is a significant and gratifying fact,inasmuch as many of the houses situate in the immediate vicinity of the court are inhabited principally by laboarers, reho, from their strong love of spirituous liquors, are but too often called upon to go through the form of a legal introduction to "*his worship." WoRsnP.-sTnREr.-Mary Lewis, a girl between 14 and 15, was charged before Mr. H MtemILL upon suspicion of being concerned in tho followring robbery:- Sergeant Webster, of the N division, was on duty at the Britanlna Saloon, Ifoxton, at hlf.past 10 on Tuesday night, when he was told by one of the ecktakers that he had noticed a girl In one of the staUs counting over a number of sovereigns, which it did not appear at all probable a grl of her age could have become honestly possessed of. The prisoner was the girl pointed out to kim, and on going up to and questioning her he found her half intoxicated, and in her hand was a small paper parcel, which upon opening It he found to oontain four sovereigns and as many shillinge. In her lap was a leathern reticule containing a rwine-glass and bottle of gin, which the prisoner said she had left money upon, to return to a neighbouring publiohouse, and her possession of the money she asoonuted for by stating that she had picked it up on the pavement while walking through the Mile-end-road, and had purchased the reticule that evening at a shop in Shoreditch. l1e was not satisfied with her story and took her upon suspicion to the station, where upon again searching her he saw her attempting to conceal something in her other hand, and in that found three more soversignq and about 14s. ii silver. The prisoner persisted in her statwment that she had £ond the money,but information afterwards reached the station that a. kdy. ha been robbed, and that lLdy was now in attendanoe. Ms EBmma MJayhewv, & widow, residing at Barasbury-- park, Islington, stated that, having occaion to call upon. some relatives at Hackney on Tueeday afternoon, she took an omnibus at the Angel to earry her to the Flower Pot, in Bishopegate-street, on reaching which she took another to carry her to Hackney. She at that time had in the pocket of her drees a purse containing eight sovereigns, a 51,-note, two finger ring and some papers, but, upon being nt dowm at her relative's in Durhan-terrae hii found that her purse had been stolen. A girl sat by her sid in the Hackney omnibus, next to her pocket,of about the sme age and appearance as the prisoner, who closely resembled her, but she oould not poftively W. ear to her as being the amne person, though she had no doubt whatever that the bag now produoed by tho police was the very ame sh h seen possessed by the girl In the vehicle, the gir, too, at that time beingdresed much more respectably than the prisoner now was. The sergeant stated that neither the bauknote nor the rings had been traced as yet, bnt he had discovered upon the prisoner a correspondenoe ticket, which clearly showed that she had been in an omnibus. The prisoner now contradicted herself by declaring that she had found the reticule, but she ws remanded for a week that the police might discover the note and the rings. THAMsS,-Mary Sheehan, the widow of an irish. labourer, came before Kr. KzLF and stated that her eus. band, who was a resident in the Whitechapel union, died about two years ago, and the parish for soze time atterwards allowed her weekly relIet towards the support of herself and her two surviving children. Some time ago it wae intimated to her that sho would be passed to Ireland with her children, and the outdoor relief was withheld, and she aRd her children were admitted into the workhouse, vwere they only remained a short time, and were turned out. She was applied to for the name of her husband's parish in Ireland, but she did not know where it was, and the relieving officer, Mr. Brooks, had communicated to her that the board of guardians had deOided tbat ahe Was not tohave symore relief. nr. SreE.-Were you born in Ireland ? The Applicant.-No, Sir, I wa born and bred in the Whitechapel district. I was never in Ireland in my life. Mtr. SxLFIL-Do you know where your husband was born? Applicant.-No. Sir. I do not. I have heard his brother say he was born in some place In Cork. Mr. SELFE.-If this is al true, I can only ay the deciaion of the board is most monstrou8 This is not the ome of an Irishwoman, born and bred in Ireland, but the ease of a Whitechapel woman, born and bred in Whitechapel, 'who was never in IrelAnd in her life, and yet the board of guardanas want to pa7s her and her children to that country. Tbe applicant said, the weeklr relief given to her waz small, hut she was enabled by her own labour to eke ot a subsistence for hereelf and chUdren. MIr. SrUX said, he hoped the Whitechapel Board of Guarians would reconsider their decision. In the absence of proof of the husband's settlement, which the parish offioers must obtain, the woman and her children were en titled to relief from the Whitechapel Union. The ma&_ trate then ordered the poor woman, who aid she wa in want of bread, some relief from the poorbox, and wrote a.. note, embodying the sentiments he had expressed, to Mr. Brooks, the relieving officer, and desired the womAn to deliver it to that functionary.
