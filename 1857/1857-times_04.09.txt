The half-yearly meeting of this compn- washeld las week at Kinross, r. J.W. VWilliamson in the chair.
The Secretary read the report, which tated that since the last meeting considerable progrea had been made with the works. The first setion of the line, extending from Iady. hank to Strathnziglo, was nearly completed, and there was every prospect of its being finished about the 1st of May; the next section, to Connaty-road, would be ready for traffic in July; and tho completion of the line to Kinross was ex. pected aDout. the end of autumn. The directors had entered into arrangements for the supplyof plant to the amount of 10,0001 Ir. J. Robertson was appointed manager of the
The CHAnmAN, in moving the adoption of the report stated that Mr. Stewart, their engineer, had asred2hiOm that they nnight with confidence look forward to the line reaching the neighbourhood of Kinross in little more than three months from the present time. The directors had proceeded with the works, knowing that they had tho unanimous feeling of the district in their favouras-promoting a great pulbl improvement, w-hich the wants of the country required. They had no desire to interfere with or to encroach upon the legitimate tac of any other railway, or to claim any character but that of a much wanted local line. The directors had considered it their duty to promote an extension of the line to the south, so as to traverse the coalfields in that direction, and a deviation to the town of Milnathort withthebview of supplsing the wholedistrict with coal and of devoloping the agricultural, commercial, anu general traflic of the district. This proposed extension had met with the most gratifying support, and the Bill autho. risig its construction now awaited the ordeal of a committee in the new Parlianent, and they had little doubt of a successfnl result in the event of its being opposedL With a wiew to avoid an expensive contest tho directors had entered into negotiations with their neighbours, the Edinburghw Perth, and Dundee Compalny; tho heads of an agreement hld been *micably discsed between committeee of both boards, and, if nothing should arise to mar the com.

On the motion of the C{AIRSM, seoonded by tir. SnsrrsoN, the directors were authorized to borrow 23,000. for the completion of the vworks.

Money-Market and City Intelligence.
XONDfY-MARB?T aw OIT YINTELLIGEAOBE.
Wednesday Evening.
This has been settling day in the English funds, and prices have again been weak and uusteady. 'Consols for rnoney, which left off yesterday at 925, 'sere first quoted 92A to ft. They then touched 921,
~but soon gave way, and declined to 92X, from which I there was no recovery, the market closing witlh ai veryheavy appearance. For the May account the! last transactions were at 92k. The main caulse of; the prevailing depression doubtless consists in the indisposition of speculators to conitinue payinlg
the high rates of interest demanded for carrying! over their purchases to the next seLtle.' ment, but. advantage was ^taken of the gloo,ny; tendency to spread a varitty of rumours. In tce Btock-Exchange it was generally repor'ed that at the meeting of the Committee of Treasury at the Bank this morning it was resolved to recommend the court to-morrow to raise the rate of discount to 7 per cent., but no such information could have been obtained wvithout a most improbable breach of duty on tho part of some member of the committee, and, moreover, there was nothing apparent in the general features of the bullion or discount markets to suggest that the rise on Thursday last had not proved sufficient'ly effectnal. A further sumnof 45,0001. Australian gold was taken to the Bank this afternoon, and there was a considerablerepayment of advances, while an amount of still greater magnitude falls due to-morrow. Hence, as far as the public can judge, there would seem little probability of a further irnmediate movement. Still there was more general Uneasiness in all departments of city businets than On any occaion for a long time past. This may have been created by an increase of stringency on tho part of the discount houses in dealing with bills ha`Vng more than ono month to run, upon which they can no longer rely as being under all circumstances negotiable at the Bank. The resolution adopted yesterday in this respect was likely to produce a considerable effect in the provinces, and is is to a reflex of this feeling that much of the dispositlon to increased anxiety manifested in London today may probably be attributed. Bank Stock closed at 216 to 218; Reduced, 91k to i ; Now Three per Cents., 9Olfto ; India Stock, 222 to 224; India Bonds, 5s. to 2s. discount; Exchequer-bonds, 98k to i; and Exchequer-bills (June), 6s. to 2s. discount; (March) is. discount to 2s. premium.
Although the payment of the dividends commenced to-day, the lowest charge for money in lhe Stock-Exchange on Govermnment securities was from 6i to 7 per cent. The discount-market was active, and at the Bank the applications were numerous, but it is believed not in oxcess of what had been anticipated from the extent of the pWyments to be mnet there.
Foreign securities continue heavy, although a fair amount of business took place. Mexican formed an exception, a alight recovery having occurred, but the highest price was not supported. The transactions for the account were at 23k, i, and i. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 96- and S, and for the account at 9;, 960, aud Z. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the bargains were at 100k and J. The general operations comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 100; Chilian Three per Cents., 79 and 78; Ecuador, New Consolidated, 14ft; Peruvian Three per Cents., for the account, 54k; Portuguese Three per Cents., 44 ; Sardixnian Five per Cents., for the account, 90; Spanish Three per Cents., 42 and 41i ; the New Deferred, 25; Spanish Certificates, 6i and i-; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97.
The final qnotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourso this evening were 68f. 95c. for money, and 69f. 10c. for the end of the month, showing an Improvement of an eighth in the former, and a decline of nearly a quarter per cent. in the latter case. If these prices are correct there must have been an abatement in the pressure for money, while the fears of the speculators must have increased.
Letters from Paris to-day assert that the position of the Bank of France is not becoming less favourable. It is said to be the last day for the payment of the caution-money on the French portion of the REussian railway schome, which, however, it 'was thought had been paid long ago. The parties to this affair find it such an inconvenient bargain, and the Russian Government are so anxious to prevent it from falling through, that all sorts of contrivances will doubtless be resorted to to keep it hanging on, so that, if it cannot be thrown upon the public at present, advantage may be thken of any future moment of temporary inflation.
The Royal MIail steamer Teviot, which sails for Brazil to-morrow, will take out 86,6701. in gold. These shipments, it is understood, are not a conse. quence of the state of the exchange, but of draughts by the Bank of Rio on their agents here to meet a local drain cau2ed by mismanagement of their note isues.
The specie arrivals to-day have been 17,0001.,namely, 6,0001. by the Afrlcan mail, 5,0001. by the Etna, and 7,0001. by the Indus from the Medi-
terranean.
The bar silver brought by the last West India steamer bas been sold to-day at 612d., showing no alteration.
At Lloyd's to-day a premium of insurance of 20 uneas was paid upon a portion of the gold by the Oneida.
NWe are re(luested to state with reference to the paragraph oni Monday relative to the vessel reported to have been passed by the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Lady Mary Wood, aground, near Shanghai, that the company have not received any advices on the subject, and that although the captains of their steamers employea under the mail contracts would not be justified in incurring delay for ordinary purposes of salvage as regards property, the Admiralty agent, or in his abnence the captain, has power to determine as " to the necessity of stopping to assist any vessel in distress or to savo human life." At the date referred to there was no Admiralty agent on board the Lady Mary Wood, but her commander Captain Munroe, has never been known to neglect an opportunity of affording assistance to vessels in distress, and the present mail conveys to him a valuable chronometer and a letter from the President of the United States in testimony of services rendered and life saved in the case of the American ship Living Age, lost in the China seas about two years ago.
At tae Court of Ban-kru tcyto-day Mr. Stapleton, .P.> a director of theRoyal British Bank, and Mr. (3raufurd, who became temporary manager after the retirement of Mr. H. I. Cameron, were examined at some length.
The lease of the chief offices of the 'Royal British Bank in Threadncedlie-street formerly the South Sea-house, was sold to-day at the Auction Mart to the Baltic Committee for 11,0001., the fixtures to be taken at a valuation, which it is thought will bring the total to about 13,0001.
The following account of the produce-markets which have lately been subject to various fluctuations owing to changes of duty and other circumstances, is from the monthly circular of Messrs. W. J. and H. Tnompson:-
"The produce-marketspresent a firmer aspect notwth. atanding the unabated stringency of monoy, and speculative operations upon amxore extended scale have occurred nearly all the leading commodities still bearing a relatively high
value, while the restrictive measures recently adopted by the Back of EnglAnd have not as yet caused any marked alteration in the gexeral tone of business. Sugar throughout the greater part of last month remained inactive, but towards the close the trade, whose stocks had reached avery low ebb, evinced a strong desire to supply themselves, and a reaction ensued, prices now being about ls. higher. LAtest accounts from Louisiana represent prospects of the
coning cropashighlyfavourable, anincreased breadth of land heinz under culftivaton, and the insect formerly the cause of the disease In ihe canes is stated to be destroyed by late severez f.roat It sems doubtful, however, If the supplJ can provr an average one ~fter the disastrous resulta o£ttle tSo pre'rlous xaeAo5i -Arrivals at this port harvebeen rather large sine. the 7th ulb., yet, the stocok in Great Britain
ls computed at 27,000 tons lees than at the corresponding period oflat year, even with clearances latterly curtiled ,
pendiog the now scale of datios lg intt opertioo. With regard to the fature course of this atticle,-it&ppears likely that, as imports can prove barely equal to thef quir3ments of Europe, a Comparatively high, range o£ pices may still be looked forvard to, and the reduced estimates of the Mauritius crop are caloulated to strengthea this opinioh At the public sales held to-day importers obtained nearly all the reduction in the duty upon the good and fine qualities, the difference on the lower kinds bei"- shared with the b-ayers. The Datch Company's sales of Sava coffee last month, althbouh cont3aining 50,O0 bags more than in Marcb, 1856, went off with great spirit, at I to 2 cents, above the valuations; and this market, which previously ruled rather quiet, has since shown an upward tendency, native being Is. aud coloury plantation Ceylon 2s. to 3s. dearer. The daty upon rum imported into the United States will he lowvered 70 per cent. on the lst of July, which has led to considerable excitement in this market, and prices are nor 2d. to 3d., and for the better qualities 3d. to Wd. higher. A further improvement of 3d. to 6d. has been paid for rice, with extensive operations for the continent, as well as upon, speculation. The demand has now somewhat abated' and latest rates show a slight decline, as the stock continuae very heavy. lAost kinds of spiee have met a ready sale at hiob&z prices, which, as regards nutmegs and mace, may be chiefly attributed to the important reduction in the xinerican duties next Jaly. Saltpetre closes dull, and 2s.to 3s.lower the result of considerable receipts from the United States. Since the conclusion of the quarterly sales in Febrmary tho indigo-m arket has presented a dull appearance. The next series, fixed for the 12th proximo, is expected to contain a very large quantity. Cotton has been steady duoing tbemornth. Sikdeclined in value to the extent of is. 6d. The tea-market has been languid. Commoncongon has 'dc.- tuated between ls. Wld. and ls., and is now is.

The Elections.
* I THEEBLECTIONS.
MIDDLESEX.
Theofficial-declaration of the pol took plaee yesterday at Brentford. About hali-past' 11 o'clocl; Sheriffs Meehi and Keats appeared upon the hustings in official costume. The successful candidates were met by their friends at Kea. bridge, and a procession, beaded by a band of music aud somd flags,.and consisting of a few carriages and a Ecore of borsern en, wearing purple and orange rosettes, was formed from this poillt. Lord I. Grosvenor, in a carriage drawn by four horses, acdompanied by his son, Ar. Fitzroy, ,.P., the chairman of his election commnittee, and SirW.- Stirlihj, his proposer, fist entered the marketplace, and was reciived with great cheering by the crotvd, the band playing "See the-Conquering- Hero comes," Mr. H. Hanbury, accompanied by his father and friends, followed in another cariage, a.nd met with a similarhearty reception. Viscount Chelsea had. walked from his comnsittee-room at Breantford to the hustings, and was awaiting the arrival of the success. ful candidates. He was accompanied by Mr. Pownsall
Ihe chairman of his committee, and other gentlemen. As smon as Lord r. Grosvenor came to the front of tho hbstings his first act was to tender his hand to Visc6untChelsea,who seemedanimated bya similar impulse. As io one appeared,to be paid to-day for msaking a noise and disturbing tile proceedings, the crowd listened to all thc speakerswith muchpatience. ViscountChelseaandhis friends toretheir defeat .vith great good humour. They exhibited a placard from the hustings, which announced that ho bad received more than 2,000 votes, while his opponents I ad each polled 4,000 split votes.
Mr. Sheriff MECH proclaimed the numbers as follows:-
Mr. R. Hanbury, jun. ... .. ... 5,426 Lord R. Grosvenor ... ... ... 5,327 Viscbunt Chelsea... ... ... ... 2,928
The SHERiPF then declared that Mr. Hanbury and Lord R. Grosvenor were duly elected. (Great cheering.)
It may be remarked that the returns publisbod by the committee of tho successful candidates were more than
usually accurate, tbe numbers issued by them at the close' of: the pol on Monday night, and printed in 17ie Time, of the following day, being-Hanbury, 5,426; Grosvenor, 5,324; Chelsea, 2,916. It will be observed that the votes given for Mr. Hanbury were correct to a man, and that the numbers given for the other candidates approached to greater exactness than is customary in accounts made up at intervals and under great haste and excitement.
Mr. ANBUPY first addressed the electors, and was warmly received. He said he could scarcely find words to express the feelings of his heart on this occasion. He trnst4d, however, that they would accept the wil for the deed, and that they would believe him to be very grateful to them, not only for the honour conferred upon him in his election, but for the Idnd, courteous, and hearty muaner in which he had been received on his canvass. (Cheers.) It had been said that at the nomination on Thursday last they had all made too long speeches. (Hear, hear.) Perhaps it w as true, and as they all felt tired with their exertions duringtherecefstcontst, what he badto say wouldbevery short, and he hoped very sweet. (Laughter.) It was a clicum. stance very unusual-nay, almost unprecedented-for so young a man, who had no previous political career to refer to, to stand in the proud and exalted position in which their suffrages had placed him. le had been called upon to represent not only the largest but the most important con. stituehey in Great Britai. (Cheers.) He felt his deficiencies to be very great, but he would say that, although they might have elected a more experienced man, they would not and could not have elected one who desired to do his duty mrore than he did. (Cheers.) He thanked them not only for returning him, but for bringing him in alongside, as he might say, of his noble friend, Lord R. Grosvenor. (Cheers.) If they had sent him to Paliament with the cloz of Toryisnm round his neck and with the chain of the middle ages round him, he hardly knew how he could have survived it. (A laugh;) In that case their members would bave ioted on opposite sides, one would have been neutralized by the other, and the county, in fact, wonld not have been represented at all. But now he should go 'into the House of-Commons with one whose political career
it would be his aim to follow, and whom he should regard as his political master. (Cheers.) There might be some little differences between them, but he trusted that the electors would look, not so much to the details, as to the general character oftheir votes, and would beheve that he desired to do his duty by the constituency of Mliddlesex as well as by the country at large. He trusted that on all important matters they would be found on one side, and that the right side (cheers), and that they would be found working together for the; moral, social, and religious improvement of the country. If at any timte he should appear to vote inconsistently with his present professions, he had only to ask that they would not condemn him unheard, bat would gve him an opportuoity of explaining his motives. If they
id not then approve his conduct let them turn him oat. The election. was in their bands. But if he offended them by his conscientious votes, he should like them to punish him as they had punished his noble friend Lord R. Grosvenor, by returning him again with alarIe majority. (Cheers and much laughter.) Thus they would prove the truth of the old adage, that "The quarrels of lovers are the renewing of love." (A laugh.) The firm to which he had the honour to belong had the honour of returning three members to the Parliament about to meet, and ho did not knowhow-to return their thanks. [A Voice. -"Push the trade !"] How could they prove thoir gratitude ? By bringing ia a Bill to make al the people oofEngland drink their good porter. (Laughter.) If they drank plenty of that stuff the old Tories would become Liberals, and the whole country would be represented in a Liberal manner. (A laugh.) Tho metropolitan county was now all of one niind. 'There was now not a single clog round their necks, and it would be their duty to advocate the interests of their constituencies and of the country at large. Ile thanked them for tbe kind reception they had given him that day. Ile only hoped that his deeds would be equal to his words, and that they would find nothing to complain of, but everything to approve in his political career. (Cheers.) He should go into the House of Commons feelng that it was the people who had sent him there. He desired to represent the people there, and, as the division of labour was the secret of business, and as his noble colleague was by his position allied- to the upper and nobler classes, so it would
e for him to care for the middle andpoorer classes. (Cheers.) Hethanked thema'd fortheirld attention aAd for theflattering position in which they had placed him, but his words were quite insuffiient to expressthe feelings of his heart. (Loud cheers.) I
Lord R. G1iosvmEoR said, that, when on Thursday last he had the hmnour of addressing them-no, by-the-bye, when he had the honour of endeavouring to speak to themi (laughter)-from the spot where he was now standing ho took the liberty of saying that although he then ehcountered a considerable display of popular disfavour, yet that when the day of reckoning came he should stil be cohi tinued as the honoured representative of Middlesex (Cheers.) He also took the liberty of saying in a hlttlo speech which he delivered in that town on the day of polling, that the emblem of political mortality which was so ostenf atiously displayed before him on the day of nomination was in fact labelled with the wrong ticket. [This allusion to a miniature coffin on which the word "Grosvenor" was written in chalk with a rude hand, and which was held up on Thursday by the discharged militia. men in the Chelsea interest before Lord Robert, created mach amusement. Here a glass of water wa birought to the noble lord, upon which a voice in the crowd called out, "Have a drop of Hanbury."] Lord Robert ejoi:-' *:, " You have had a drop too much." He proceeded to &; that if they would grant him their patient attention he wonild promise not to trespass at any length, and he would, at all events, endeavour to say aothing to excite acrimonious feelings. (Hear, hear.) High as was his position on the poll there were eirecmstances attending his election that left him no ground for boasting or undue exultation. He did not deceive himself as to the state of feeling in the countv during the contest for the reDresant-. tion, and he was quite aware that if he had only done during this election that which he had done on former occasions, and had contented himself with going round the county and addressing the electors at the various polling plrces, Iis posltion on the poll wou nave ve ocen very diferent. It was only owing to the perseverance, the zeal, the untiring exertions of those of his friends who had adhered to him through good report and through evil report (loud cheers from Lord Robert's friends upon the hustings) that he owedthepositionhe occupieduponthe poll thatdayThey were no4, he rejoiced to ray, a scanty band, and he
couId not refer to them all, but he trusted they would al receive his hearty thanks. There was one gentleman whose name was held in honour, and who had stood forward as his fast friend-Mr. Robert Hanbury, the father of their present member. (Loud cheers.) Disregarding all those promptlngs of paternal pride which might so naturally have exercised an influence in dragging himn into an opposite directior,, Mfr. Hahury threw himself into the con'est as if
s sole idea had been how to replace their old muember in his position in the representation, (Loud cheers) In-these days of sel.seeking, when too tmany men appeared to be determined to,become rch by iny and all means-when the desire to accumulte wealth land the staion that accompaned it seemed about to sap even the moral foundations of society, there was a band, and tot a small one, of the merchants and tradersof this country who, satisfied with an ade. quite competence, diadanedtohoardupin theirgarners their np;us ealth, nd who, withaliberal-he had almost said a reckles hand, emgployed it in-founding, rearing,: and endow3ngthosehouses of mrcy and charity that were alike tho glory, and safeguard of ouar country.

(Laughter, and three cheers for Mfr. Grosvenor.) Let him now observe of his noble relative and opponent, Lord Chelsea that whateverbis supportcr- had done for him he had fought a most gallant fighbt.(Hear.)He tru-ted that nothing badloccurredduring this election that would tend to impair the regard, esteem, . nd frien's *ip v hi h they had entertained for each otherfor so long a series of Sears, and wbichhe believed was founded upen principles of mutual esteem. And it either he (Lord
, Grosvenor) or his supportershad, in the heatof the Contest, suffeted anything to fall unadvisedlyfromtheirlips, let him nowvmake a clean hreast of .t, and say that, considering the divided state of the party to which the noble viscount belongedi and that his only chance of success 'was founded on what he mout call the temporary unpopularity of' their old member.(" No!"), he was, if he must own-it, vexed that his cousin and friend should be, of all men in the world, the mpnr.to avail himself of such circumstances. (Cheers, and a Voice-" Ie won't do sO again.") He thought that if his noble relative had known the circumstances' as they were known to others of his party, he would not, at the eleventh hour, have come forward to disturb his sat. Buthle owned now that he ought to have felt more consideration for the exigencies of party than to feel vexed' that his noble relative had come forward to contest the county agalnst bim. He knew how imperious those exigencietwere, and, if anything th.at had occurred had annoyed his noble relative, he said most sincerely that be was sorry for it. (Cheers.) He was sorry if this defeat should lring mortification with it, and he would -give his noble relative an. historical reason why he should feel no nortification at his present defeat. Some 150 yearsao, in the reign of the good Queen Anne, a time fertilein mi'itery genius, an ancestor of his noble relative was a distinguished captaint, the friend and companion of Marlborough, who, under that great comknander, promoted the honour and glory of his country and defended the independence of Europe. Just as that ancestor looked up to Marlborougb, and did not think it a disgrace or a defeat to bawith the great captain when he failed, so in a field where a Churchi
bad been baffled a Cadogan'need not dread a defeat. jH re the first drops of a shower were felt, anda Toice M th
crowd, in piteous accents, exclaimed, " Do cut it shortl !" Lord Robert, sympathizing with the gentleman who had left his umbrella at-home, rejoined, amid. much laughter, "I wish you bad a little Hanbury raining upon you instead of water."] His zolleague, Mr. Hanbury, had said that, if be would take the aristocracy, he would taothe democracy. Now, he did not intend to yield up the deinocraoy to his colleague at all. He prided himself on not neglecting them or any other portion of the constituency. (Hear.) [Here the shower which had been falling fast for afewr moments began to. cause the dispersion f Lord Robert's audience. At first afew outsiders vanished, hut the rain soon fell in such a torrent that the noble lord stpped in his address, and the crowd, fairly taking to their heeds were seen rashing down " all manner of streets" in search ot shelter. After waiting a few minutes the shower passed off the audience gradually returned, and Lord Robert proceededwithhisspeech.] He was told that hs owed his temporary unpoputlarity to his votes on the China question and the Sunday Trading Bill. He was most desirous to say a few words on the latter subject, because, notwithstanding the explanation he had given, the scope and object of the Sunday Trading Bil were, not yet understood. . In his ride on the day of polling he was asked by three or four working men wether. a placard was true, that he had introduced a measure for preventing the recreation of the people? He told them that if they would only cometo Brentwood to-day he would explain the matter so clearly -to them -that " he wiho rva might red" In regard to his vote on the China question, no doubt the constituencies of tho country had pronounced a verdict against him. (Cheers.) But he must be permitted to say, and he hoped' he was not very obstinate in repeating it, that thereal question never had been befoie the constituencies. The question itself had been so completely mixed up with the irritation against the Peace-at-all-price party, and also with the anger of the people at what they believed to be a most unworthy attempt to upset Lord Palmerston, that the real question never had been decided whether the papers did or did not justify the proceedings taken against tbe Chinese. That was the real question which the House of Commons had to decide, and he believed that when the smoke and dust of this political conflict had. cleared away the calm and inepartal historian wrould return a verdict in favonr of those vho had honourably voted in favour of the majority. With regard to the second question, he had been accused of having appered in the rnost odious of all possible characters, for it had been said that ho had endeavoutred to oppress the poorer classes and those w-ho were peouliarly helpless and defenceless. If that charge could he substantiated against him he would never show his face in Middlesex again. (Cheers.) Ihere vere in the metropolis 30 miles ot shops open on a Sunday, and there were 50,000 persons who were deprived of theirholyday by .those shops being kept open for Sunday trading. Forty thouxsand of those persons had petitioned for a legisltive enactment .to free them fromntbat galling slavery. The. only object and intention of his Bill, if it hadf passed, would have been to give to thore toiling> -slaves that rest and recreation on the Sabbath which their position so loudly demanded. (HLear, hear.) Now, he had been accused of a vwant of sincerity in abandoning that Bill, but by withdrawing it be had disqualified himself from ever bringing it forward again. Yet he felt confident, from the extraordinary changes which were taking placo in public opinion, that those who, having been misguided and having misapprehended his Bill had felt the greatest anger against him, would, ere long, be amiong the first. to petition that this matter should be settled by legislation. ("Oh I" and "Hear 1") He would tell them what- led him to that belief. During the recent elections the constituencieE had been to a great extent unanimous on the China question, yet there was another question on which they were still more unanimous, and that was in their determination, especiaUy evinced in the most populous constituencies, ntever to see violated the people's holyday-tlhe Sunday. (Hear.) One candidate for a metropolitan borough had treated the statementr that he had signed apetition for openingplacesofamusomenton Sundays, as thegreatestinsult tbat could be offered to bim, and tho gentleman who had polled the largest number of votes ever at one time given for a candidate (Mr. Roupell) deelared at the hustings that he would neither then, nor at any other tine, vote for nmeasures whioh would violato the sanctity of the people's holyday. (Cheers.) He hoped that he had now done with this suhject, and that he should not have to tallc about it again. (Aanugh. ) It only'now em.ained forhim to sa thattho electors had again imposed upon him a most onerous duty. This time, however, the duty wasnotquite so heavyas on formeroccasions; forwhereas, from the factof his late colleague having been in office, the whole brunt and weight of their local business had of late faUen upon himFelf they had now by giving him a colleague who was not in office, who was himself a Middlesex man, and connected with the business of the county, taken half the burden off his shoulders. He would not insult them by any promises. If 10 years spent in their service and 35 years of political life were not a guarantee for the future he was not fit to represent thom at all. (Cheers.) He would therefore only say in conclusion that so long as they desired his services they would be at their command. When he was told a few weeks ago that he had no chance of representing Mlddlesox at this election, he was ready to say, as no doubt his noble relative and opponent was now ready to may, that if he could not serve Middlesex in a public capacity he would do his bsst to serve the county in a private capacity. (Hear, hear.) So sIeag as he had health and strength they were at their ser. vice, and when they began to fail he should not wait for a
lNut from the electors to resign his trust into younger and abler, but not more honourable or more zealous hands. (Cheers.) He now respectfully bade them farewell, and he trusted that, if he were spared again to present himself bhefore them ar.; surrender his trust into their hands, the electors of Middlesex would not be ashamed that they had put their affairs into the hands of that best of firms-True-nan and Hanbury." (Loud eheers and laughter.)
Viscount CIIELSEA next presented himself and was woll toeceived. He said, he had no reason to disguise or conceal from himself that this was a painful ordeal for him to go through, yet he should scorn himself if he shrank from the task. (Cheers.) If any man attended there with the ex. pectation of hearing one word from him savouring of faintheartedness or calculated to cause animosity or ill-will *aginst his opponents, that man was grievously mistaken. (Cheers.) He felt it his duty to himself, to the great cause whose battle he had beeu fighting, and to those kind and
generous friends who had stuck by him in that uphill contest, to come down here and tender his cordial thanek-s for their assistance. Another duty ho had to discharge was to assert and prove that he had not embarked hastily and unadvisedly in the contest; but that, on the contrary, he hadfair grounds not only for entering upon it, but for persovering in it to the very last moment. (Hear,
hear.) . Looking to the stato of the registration,
to the result of the last election, and sti more to the. evidences of public feeling manifested daring the 10 days in which ho had availed himself of every opportunity of ascertaining the state of public opinion, he had a fair right to expect a very different result. (Cheors; counter cries of "1 Yes a" and "No l" and several Voices" They. decoived yo ! ") He had taken' every opportunity' of ascertaining the public feeling of the county. (Hear.) As far as the time allowed he 'had attended meetings, of

maority."
(Cheers and expressions of dissent.) Ie was willing to rest his justification on the words he had just read. (Hear.) His noble relative had complain'ed that he hatd come forwaird at the eleventh hour to malce an attack upfon his reat. His answer was, that some time before he finally declared himself a candidate he was called upon to stand by several gentlemen of his political party. Hlis f-rtwords were, "I will be your candidate' if'You think'there are none better qualified, but- I will not interfere with the claims of a betteS candidate, and'especially of Lord Blaudford, who has gone through one xtruggle." (HeAr, hear.) The idea of calling upon the Marqsns of,Blandford was enterained, and was under diidussoi~ for some days, and it vas not until he iscertnWed tbht Lornd Blaidford would not conle forwaid thit he placed himself' at the disposal of his friends. (Hear, hear.) As to his coming forward being a personal attackon bisnoble relative, it was the only imjustipoble allusion heolad made, anadtho onl- ono he could *ish he ha left;unspoken. He hadaelrady sdthat, uness npon some all-engrossing question, the constituenc-wouianot only, ie justifed in continuing. their confidence in his noble relative, but wo-tld bo boundnot to withdraw it from a man whose attention to the local interests of the conuty and vhose assiduity in the discharge of hii duties rendered him not unworthy to represent the county of Middlesex. (Cheers.) So far as personal feeling had been concerned, what bad been his (Viscount Chelsea's) conduct in 1852? :He had split his vote between Lord Blandford audl Lord R, Grosvenor., and being by a coincidence at the polling-booth at Uxbridge on 'the ' day of polling he regretted to see his noble relative arive up, t. and after asking "Who are the candidates?" (a laugh) give a plumper for Mr. Hanbury. Ie thought his noble relative night havo reciprocated the good feeling whichi'he had shown in 1852, and given a split vote for Mr. Hanbury and himself (Lord Chelsea). In conclusion, ho would call upon the grea-t Conserv~ative party in the~ metropolitan county not to be disheartened. Thevy had seen. worse times tahan them, and had, witv, the spirit of undaunted Euglishmen, asserted the'goodness of their cauEe and carxied it to a successfiil issue. . They had done so in ' 841, and they woula do so the next tine they were caUed upon to select a representative for that important county. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. HMBuRy, in a highly eulogistic speech, then pro. posed that tho hearty tbanks of the electors sbould be given to the Sheriffs for the kind, efficient, and thoroughly impartial manner in which they had performed their duties. (Cheers.) They were very greatly indebted to the Sheriffs, and he was sure the vote would be agreed to unanimously.
Viscount CHELSEA seconded the resolution, which. Ivas carried by acclamation.
MSr. Sheriff MEEcm said, it took two sheriffs of LondoA to make one sheriff of Middlesex (a laugh), and therefore he had to return thnnks for his brother Keats and himself as one sheriff. He congratulated the meeting on the good humour with which they had transacted the important business they had. been called uponto discharge, and which had been performed in a manner creditable to them as Englishmuen. (Cheers.)
The procoeedings terninated at a few minutes before 2 It may be noted that the members for the metropolitan county are not "girt wvith a sword" like other counuty members uPOn their election, Perhaps some reader of lY'ot&, and Qucries may be able to state whether the pr,ctice in Middlesex is singular in this respect, and why the custom, if it ever prevailed, fell into desue'ude.
KENT (WEST).
DEoLARA.Toic OP THE POLL.
The declaration of the poll for the western division of Rent took place in front of the Town-hall, Maidstone, yesterday afternoon, at 1 o'cloc. A. large concourse on foot, on horseback, and in carriages assembled to grace the victory obtained by the Liberal electors, and completely thronged the high street of the town.
The MGIn Sn:xnFr (Mr. J. Savage) declared the numbers were, for
Mr. C. Wykeham Martin (L) ... ... 3,896 Mr. James Whatmau (L.) ... ... 3,578 Mr. W. Masters Smith (C.) . 3,171
Majority for Mr. Martin - ,25
Ditto Mr. Whatman ... 407
It was therefore his duty to declare Mr. Martin and Mr. Whatman to havebeen duly elected.
Mr. M31ruy, in addressing the electors, congratulated them on the result of their exertions. They had won a double victory for the principles of Liberal government and progressive reform within the lastseven weeks-a result which was the more satisfactory inasmuch as the next Parliament was likely to be the most important which hAd mtt since the passing of the Reform Act in 1832. The people of this country had now unmistakeably declared for movement-for the progressive improvement of the national imstitutiocs, for an extension of the eleotive franchise, and for a wise economy in the expenditure of the Adminis-. tiation. (Loud cheer.) Although they might haase selected a mcre efficient advonate to promote their wishes, he begged to assure the electors that none could be more earnebt or more zealous in the cause than he; and he should go to the House of Commons determined to aid to the utmost of his power in forwarding all measures which he could approve, whether brought forward by the Government or byoother parties, having for their object the advancement of Parlianmntary and social reform, the diffusion of public education, and the extension aud maintenance of civil and religious freedom. (Cbeers.)
Mr. WHATmAw next addressed theassemblage, expres3ieg rentiments similar to those of Mr. Wykeham Martin, wish whom he regarded it as an honour to be associated ia ths rPpresentation of so numerous, wealthy, and intelligeut a constituency as that of West Kent. He also enteredcinto some explanation of a correspondence which had taken place between Sir Culling Eardley and himself during the recent canvass. Sir Cullirg, though wholly opposed to the Maynooth grant, had refused to support Mr. Masters Smith because of bis vote against the policy of Lord Palmerston with respect to the Chine so question, andin giving bissuffrage to the Liberal candidates he had expressed his a bation of a compromise suggested by the Roman Catho;ics tbemstlves, in order to obviate all futue contention rerpecting the grant-to the effect that the College of Maynooth should be transferred, once for all, to the Catholic, and a sum of money be paid them in sati'faction of al; claims for the annual payment made ever since seven yeas before the union between England and Ireland. (Hear, bear.) Ef thanked the electors for the honour they- had conserred on tim,an prmie faihf-- to- do his utmos
conferred on him, and promiseed faif yffi to do his utmos' to jeutify the donfidence they bad reposed in him. (Cheem)
Avote of thankswas then given by acclamation to the High Sheriff, followed by a loud cheers for Thomas LAw Hodges, Esq., formerly the Liberal member for the division, for the nev ly-elected members, and for. the Qeoen.
Aprocesionwas thenformed,without the accompaniment, however, of a band, and after parading the principal streets ef the tow3, the houees of which were more profusely and gaily decorated than usual with blue flags and banners, the multitude, who maintained the rmost perfect good humour and good order throughout, quietly dispersed.

AliblAGic (BOROUGR).-Ap.opos of coalitions the Banner -of Ulster says : -" This is the age of coalitions, and aniong
these the developments Of Party in the ancient city of Armagh are not the least remarkable. Will it be believed thatg, onthe Clatecanvas' for the representxtion of that borOugh, the chaplains of 'his Grace John George Beres. ford and the priestly followers of the Roman Catholio Primnate, Dr. Dixon, should he alik actively engaged on behalf of Mr. Bond, the ousted miember? And yet it is most true-the energy of the latter being only rivalled by the Protestant zeal of their fellow-helpers in the same common caue. We have all heard of poor Presbyterian pastors being chastised for being found In similar juxtaposition on a ' tenant-rlght' platform; but here is a aoee in which, under the )higes ecclesiastical sanctlon, the abettors of Anglican an Roman prelacy are found lovnngly munting for one of the most important oblects that can occupy -the attention of the contnunity."
DowNr (CouNrriy.)-It is statedaby one of the Northern papers that the Marquis of Hertford, the Earl of Clanwil1iam, the Earl of Abnesloy, and Lord Dungannon, 'who are most extensive proprietors in the county, while they desire to support Lord Edwin Hill, have no notion of in any way attem ptin to use their iniluence with their tenantry to vote for Colonel Fordo in opposition to Mr. Ker.
ING'S COUTY.-A not very probable rumour intimates
Mr. E 0. Hughes having retired from a contest in Long,ford, is about to offer himself to the electors of
in's County, and that on Saturday next he will be put in nomination, ite is further rumoured that Mr. Elughes will be supported by a number of teh Roman Catholie clergy.
Luxrrma (Couse).-No day has yet been fixed for the election. A Dubln Derbyite paper announces that Lord Carlisle has peremptorily refused to release Major Orrmsby G (one of the Conservaive candidates) from his position asaghg sherff o°f the county, Hence the delay il the issu. ing of the writ. ~ ~ ~ ~ te izu
LxsnultS.-There seems, according to the Belfast Daily Mlercury, to have been a " contest" for this borough in every sense of the word. Mr. Richardson was the popular candidate, and upon the first appearance of the poLL oing against him the mob testified their sympathy with his cause by smashing the windows of his opponents' houses. From these strong manifestations they proceeded to open acts of violence against such voters as tried to approach the poU on behalf o Colonel Hogg. The voters were brought to the polling booth in covered cars, escorted by a few troopers of the 8th Hussars, but the latter formed but inefficient sreens from the stones aimed at the unfortunate possessors of the franchise. Dean Stannus and his son, Mr. Walter Stannus, justice of the peae, tried to reach the poll in a covered car, around which was a cavalry escort, but the mob, amonting
then, it is said, to 2,000 persons, closed in on both car and . escort, smashed the car, nearly captured Mr. Stannus, and . at length forced the dean and his son to take refuge in the Hertford Arms Hlotel, the windows of which they immediately proeeeded to demolish. The military force, which consisted of 25 men of the 8th Hussars, 25 of the 51st regiment, and about D0 of the constabulary, could do nothing, it is said, unless they fired on the mob, and this they were restrained from doing by Captain Butler. He read the Riot Act, but dedlised to tak:a on himself the responsibility of ordering the troops to fire, althou"h their guns were loaded in case of the worst. After bloe.- ading the Hertford Arms for some time, the mob at 3 o'clock went to the house of Mr. Bannister, a publican, in which committee-rooms had beeen opened for Co onel Ho. Here, after smashing the vwidows, they broke into theolouso and demolished a most everything that was capable of being broken. The houses of Mr. Young and Mr. Phillips, publicans, in Bridge-street, and Market-square, were next attacked and served in the same manner. The mob then proceeded to Dean Stannus's house, in which they smashed all the windows, bat failed to force the door. The house of a Mr. Stephenson, a solicitor, was similarly treated, and Mr. Stephenson himself, who tried single-handed to capture somoe of the mob, was wounded In the head with a stone and severely cut. A telegraphic message was then sent to Belfast for more military but ere they arrived the bouses, of John Knox, cutler, br. Thompson,¶ Captain Bolton, William Honna, grocer, C. Shields, grocer, G. W. Braddell, J. Herman, Joln Armstrong, W. Whitla. T. Patterson, J. Kidd, W. Chapman, David Machk, and John Edgar were each attacked and more or less damaged. At 7 in ite evening, ana after the poll had closed in favour of Mr. Richardson, about 100 of the 51st Regiment arrived from Belfast, and their presence succeeded at last in restoring ordee, though the inhabitants of the town remained in a state of grat trepidation throughout the night. Dean Stannus and hisson were during the evening escorted home by the military.
QuTxy's COt'NTY.-The extraordinary coalition between the Eigh Tory and the Radical appears to be an accomnplisbed fact. It was utterly impossible, says the Leinster Express, that Mr. Fitzpatrick could keep pace single-handed against the voting, Coote and Dunne having so repeatedly reeived the same votes in the several districts. It is stated that in some places the polling on the first day was at an) early hour altogether suspended from the violence and intimidation used towards Mr. Fitzpatrick's supporters
TIPPERAIRY (COUNTY).-The contest promises to be one of the most exciting of the Irish counties. Private letter3 state that Major Massey, the qrasi Liberal, is gradually losing Forund. Some explanation of this reverse may be fouId in a letter addressed to a local paper bylr. Edmund Power, the conducting agent for Mr. Waldron, in which he says,-
A rumous tbat a letter had been receliod by Mr. Moore from the gallanSMtMair, to some extout deriding hls political piofesijons of faith,aa esreeseed In hbi addres, having been pretty freely cirulAted n thbis town and neighbourhood, I called on bI. Moo- to ascertin
if that report had aoy and what foundatioo, and was informed by that gentleman, that ho did recelve a leCtte from Major Maseey, containing the foUlowing pawago. whloi I then noted down:-'You must not mind my being a RaUcal; you know I must be so to please those poople. '
The Very Rev. Dr. Leahy, Archbishop elect and Vicar Capitalar of Cashel and Emly, has addressed a circular to the clergy of the diocess, setting forth the part which it becomes them all to act on the ocoasion of the approaching election. He says:-
"The ordinaryabuthoity of the d'oe ss being lommited to my haad it itbo the daty occanyone to aldrze,to the clergy a wordiof admonition. thatduty anae. Anda duty it wDlboadmittedtobe,or at leat a thing rery properto do. Ifw bear inmindhowtbolateelection for thi oountywas mrkedbyadegresof violence without aparallel n the history of our county's contested elections, and afflicting to the beaut of everY priest, asc It s to be depreoted by every good man, As regards the coming elections, the clergy have a double duty to poerfo; one to arry tbemselves In su0b mannuer acbeat their sacred character and caling; the othas to emaloy their well-eaned InSuenoo
with the people for the purpose of inducing the latter to exercise the elective franchise onscientiously, and at the camre time without violating the Ilws of God or mao. Of this doablo duty the clergy wil h3lbe acuitted theinoulve If they observe the statutes of onr own dioce8, the euactments of the National Synod of Thurles, and the Decrees of the gynodloal Mee'tug
ofDubluinn1851, regulating what subjects the clergy may aad may not treat of in their churches, how they shou!d treat of them, ani in general how they ought to deal wIth Political matters.

A Canadian Dargan.-Among the 70 or 80
A CANADIAN fDARcuw.-Awong the 70 or 80 passengers killed by the late dreadful railway accident at
ton in Canada, was Samuel. Zimmermann, the great ,andian zailway contraotor. A Rochester paper a&s," He was born in Huntingdon county, Pennsylvania, in the year 1815, and in 1842 removed to Canada, having no capital bat energy, farsightedness, a gray horse, and buggy. He was then but 27 years of age. H is first undertaking the construction of four locks andan aqueduct on the Wellaud Canal, which involved something like $1,000,000. Subsequently hebuilt 120 milesof tbeGreat WesternRailway. Thebuilding of thefDrst suspension-bridgeatNiagam Falls and of the great railroad-bridge at the same place engaged his attention. He built the Cobourg and Peterboro, the Port Hope and I,nd. say, and the Erie and Ontario Bailwaysin Canada. Mr. Ziminermann originated and had just completed thepreliminary arrangement for building a. now road to the West, nearly parallel with the Great Western, to the south of that line, and on a shorter and better route. This work was to codt some ten millions of dollars. Not long since he had pur chased a large property at Clifton, Niagara Falls, and in the vicinity of the suspenslon bridge. including the fine hotel known as the IClifton House,' and his excellent taste and liberal ideas were illustrated in improving this fine estate aud adorning it artistically. Fifty-two acres on the Cliff, directly opposite the American Falls, are enclosed with an iron fence and privet hedge. The topography of these grounds is diversified aud picturesque. That part nearest the river is level, and thi is laid out in grvelled walks, -with shrubbery, forest trees, and fountains. One fountain was construckd at a cost of $15,0O0. These groves and shaded promenades are lighted during the summer evenings with gas. The proprietor's residence stands on a blaff somae 60 feet high, midway of the ample grounds. In the summer it is nearly hidden by the foliage of the surrounding trees. This dwelling is an unpretending mansion, but has always been the scene of generous hospitality. He had plans for an elegant mansion-hous, with the proper accessories and surroundings, The foundations of a builng of Cleveland sandstone and Canadian brick, to cost $175,000, were laid last year, and the work was to be prosecuted immediately. His lodges, of which there are four, the conservatory, and tenements for hbis servants are models of taste. His stables, completed last year, cost $48,000. From the terraces on the grounds and the portico of his dweUling a slendid view of the Amencan Fall is obtained. Clifton House is near by - one of the most complete and popular hotels thot any watering-place can boast. This was owned by Mr. Zimmermann, and was worth over $300,000. At Elgin, on the westem side of the river, at the auspensionbridge, the deceased formerly owned a large property, which his own liberal expenditure and judicious enterprise had rendered very valuable. This was sold last year to his friends Messrs. PiersonL and Benedict for $200,000. At Toronto he owned property valued at $400,000; at Hamilton an estate worth $100,000. He was owner of the steamer Zimmermann, on Lake Ontario, and half-owner of another boat, the Peerless; his interest in both amounting probably to $100,000. Some 18,000 acre of land, in different parts of CAnada, belonged to him. go estimated his property to be worth $i3,000,000. The deceased was a man of limited education, bn he was endowed with serling nmental gifV. Intercoarte with mnen of the highest ehacter and influenoe had imparted an elevated tone,: autity, and equanimity to hismbann,,ers. we ben6evolerice *AJ, ono of bag maurkedt

London, Thursday, April 9, 1857.
ZO&DO2, THURSDAY, APPIL 9, 1857.
Mow that we have our new House of Commons ,there comes again the question,-Who is to be the zuew Speaker? That question is already answered, - far as it can be at present, by the selection -of Dlr. EVELYN DENIsoN; for the Ministerial -candidate. The result of a contest ought to :be not only successful, but triumphant; and therefore it is an object to start a candidate who -will command not only a majority, but the largest ,possible majority. Two other names have been suggested on the Ministerial side,-the Right Hon. M. T. BAINES and the Right Hon. H. FITZROY; -and we will attempt a comparison of all three. 'The first of these is a man of much ability, -and one who has worked hard in his time at secondary posts. His industry and his good -temper, his legal knowledge and his official habits, would havo been qualifications for an -office which threatens at first to be unusually harassing. More than a quarter of the new House is made up of new members. Whether it 'be a recommendation or not, the country would not; have lost by the choice of Mlr. BAINES either an orator or a man of the highest Ministerial rank. It is some time since he made speeches or entered much into debate, and his present official position must be referred to one of those secrets of statecraft of which the public has not the key. NVhy men of large private fortune, commercial origin, more sense than genius, and more industry than figure, should be selected for the Duchy of Lancaster,-an ornamental place with more pay than work,-is a mystery wholly beyond our comprehension. Yet Mr. BAnNEs, and Mr. SrrUTT before him, seem to have been thought the very men for this honourable and unimportant post. All that we have said hitherto goes rather for the selection of Mr. BAINES; but there were, in his case, two objections, both of a practical character. In the first place, he is 58 years of age, and does not -carry uis years well. Now, we have generally got a good deal of work out of our Speakers, sixteen years out of MANNERS SurrOw, and eighteen years out of the now Viscount EVERSLEY. It is an -object to have long periods of office, as it tends
to the continuity of the House. The late SPEAKER felt it necessary to retire at the age of 63, and if Mr. BANEs had followed his example in that respect he would only give the country five years for his pension and his peerage. A still more serious objection was, that MIr. BAINES is so shortsighted that, even with spectacles, he can scarcely see across the House. Now a Speaker, if no tongue, ought to be all eyes. His eye is his ministerial organ. He has to catch the member's eye, and exchan6e 4lectrie signals of the most rapid and confidential character. Blind men can do many thingA, but not when they can neither touch nor speak.
Mr. H. FiTZRoy is younger by eight years. Re is a man of good presence and lofty bearing. Re has also the advantage of some preparation for the office as Chairman of Committees. No one doubted either his ability or his experience; it was only suggested that his natural warmth and quickness of manner might unfit him for a post which requires imperturbable calmness. The post itself, however, has evidently a large fund of tranquillity for the benefit of its occupants, and a hasty Speaker must be so in spite of circumstances. Mr. FITZROY may or may not succeed to the family title ; but, while some might have objected that he is therefore not the man to choose for the First Commoner in the kingdom, and others might have thought it a gain that he would possibly not entail an addition to the Peerage, it would at aU events be very hard that he should be excluded both fromii the Commonalty and the Peerage simply because there is a clhance of his elder brother, at tlte age of 53, dying first without issue. As a Liberal Conservative Mr. H. FITZIaOY would have united many suffrages, anA his would, we thinlk, have been a very good appointment.
The candidate on whom the choice of the 'Government has ultimately fallen, MIr. EVELYN DENisoX, has in an unusual degree all those personal advantages which we are accustomed to i-k for in a Speaker. A tall, handsome man, with a good voice and manner, must be very wanting to his natural endowments if he cannot command the attention and respect of a body of English gentlemen. Mr. EVELI-N DENIsoN, though connected by marriage with the house of PORTLA.ND, is a thorough representative of the Commons of England. His seat for the Northern Division of his county vwill make him acceptable to the county members. He has sufficient fortune, and is altogether what would be called a singularly unexceptionable candidate, whlich in these critical days is more than half the battle. In ability he is quite up to the mark,-more so, indeed, than his performances in the House hitherto would appear to promise. He is viAling to be put in nomination, and wwil have the support of the Liberal nembers. It is true he is not so young as would be desirable, being in his fifty-seventh year, but he has the look of health and strength; and his long Parliamentary career, beginning with a severe contest for Liverpool, will be fitly concluded with a peerage. What tells more, however, than all we could say of him is, that he will probably be chosen without a contest.
It is not for us to pronounce very confidently which of these very dissimilar candidates would have proved the best qualified for the work of combining the various elements of the new Rouse, com,manding their common respect, and moulding the whole into a legislative unity. The task wiU be one of some diffieult. There never were so many new members The losses are those of men who have been brought into harness, who have learnt the,
? 'f Them--ne, and submitted to its discipline; and the gains are problematic. The survivors of the baffled factions mnay well be furious at the retrospect of their suicidal folly, for certainly, if over men did dig a pitfall and tumble into it themselves, this feat has been successfully achieved by Conservatives, Peelites, and Leaguers. The only chance for those who remain is to recruit their thinned ranks from the 150 new men, and no arts of debate, no powers of declamation, wiU be spared to entrap or seduce the MOMo hopeful novices. Al this inight not bring much work for the Speaker, were it not for that continual obstruction which in these days is the great engine of Parliamentary warfare. Everybody now does his best to prevent everybody else from doing anything, in order that no one may be able to make a better list of political merits. The genius of the age is critical and obstructive. Thirty years ago we were pulling down institutions; now we pick plans to pieces, and have the most excellent reasons, not against all that is, but against aU that might be. When Ministers meet Parliament and gradually unfold their budget of reforms they will have to encounter a motley phalanx, earnest no longer in defence of comuption, but in opposition to all possible remedies. Such a cause has less to be said for it than even the frantic zeal of those who fought for their ancient strongholds in the generation gone by. The battle will be waged with less heart and less principle. This conflict with obstruction it is that awaits Mr. EVELirx DsumN-I, and it will tax all the powers we can find in one man. A perfect Speaker, as it seems, is not easily found. When shall we find a fit man for any place? It is only some consolation to know that there have been the same difficulties before, and that men have grown into their places. The office not only tries the man; it often also makes him. We have a strong faith in the divinity that hedges rouid the Speaker's chair. We do not doubt that we shaU see the new House yielding its wonted homage to its elected chief, and obeying the national instinct of order. Whence the genius, the vigour, and the patriotism are to come that are to guide the House and inaugurate new measures time alone can show.
There is a Book in which we read that there
There is a Book in which we read that there was once a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day; and that there lay at his gate a certain beggar, full of sores, who soughlt the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table; and that the dogs came and licked his sores; and there follows then an awful revelation of the spiritual state of those two men and their eternal awards. The story is eminently picturesque. The rich man in his gorgeous attire at his well-spread table, with his servants bustling about here and there, is seen in the same group with the wretched mendicant lying under his porch, with the rude attendance of street curs. But is not this a painter's license, and the story itself, perhaps, a figure of speech ? Was there ever such a rich man so indifferent to the spectacle of misery at his door ? But let us only expand the narrative into something a thousand times more shocking. Take each particular, and let it grow to a worse variety and a colossal magnitude. Let the rich man be a company, a city of rich men, the richest, without hyperbole, on the earth, and commanding by their wealth the wealth of all the earth. Let them surpass all the world in the elaborate costliness of all that contributes to health and material enjoyment. Give them palaces, and furnituire, and equipages, and jewels, and pictures, and food for a thousand finer tastes than those of the coarse voluptuary in the parable. Let the poor man be worse than poor, degraded, all sores in and out, vitiated in soul as in body. But let him be helpful and necessary to the rich man, building his palace, procuring his rich fare, and contributing, as foulness can do, to his purple and fine linen. So let there be more than a painter's juxtaposition. Let there be an actual bond and a useful relation. Let this bond, then, be utterly disregarded; and, instead of the rich man at his board and the beggar a few steps off at his gate, let tho rich man and his whole fraternity hie awvay before sunset every day to carthly paradises afar off, qu;te clear of diseased beggars or reeking labourers, so that their very crumbs shall not reach such miserable objects. Then let the poor be driven from the portals of the rich, even from their storehouses and their banks, and be cooped up in horrid lairs and dens. Let them lie there without even the natural separation of wild beasts, or that instinctive jealousy which makes the male protect the dam from initrusion, and guard his whelps from harm. Let the fact be such as parable could not describe, painters could not paint, and angels would not look upon. iLet there be not even dogs to lick the poor man's
sores, and when he dies let him hardly even ba buried. Then let all his future be dark and lhopeless. Let there be a vast crowd in this horrid state. Thus, every circumstance being aggravated, let the link between the two conditions be not simply a visible contrast, but a real obligation, known, but disregarded. When we have said all this, and could we add much more, svc should oDly describe inadequately two actual classes and conditions in the city in which we dwell.
The city which we speak of is not that vast wilderness of streets and lan s that stretches out for many miles in every direction, but strictly the "City ;" the very nucleus of this metropolis, the fountain-head of earth's riches, the resort of all nations. It is no such vast place, and the lairs and dens we mention are only a few stones' throw from the great mart of trade, where millions daily pass from hand to hand. Here in narrow passages, but a step or two from the public thoroughfares, the Medical O)licer of Health pursues his researches, not less perilous than those of the discoverer in Central Africa or the Arctic Seas. He describes not only the common and inevitable crowding of large families into one small room, but numbers of men and women, with children among them, herding together like the uncleanest brutes or the worst of savages, in heaps of dirt and moral vileness; "where aU the offices of nature " are performed in the most public and offensive " manner, and where every instinct of decency and " propriety is smothered." He describes men and women sleeping with their parents; grown-up brothers, sisters, cousins, and casual acquaintances, all on the same heap of rags and straw. He sees among them women in travail, new-born children, the fever-stricken, the dying, the dead-all horrioly intermingled; not to mention instances of even more extreme debasement. These general statements he proves by figures. He enumerates 48 men, 73 women, and 59 children living in 34 rooms; and the distribution is even more vicious and abominable than the sum total would require. Alore and more instances of this kind present themselves, and as the back streets fall into decay they pass into the occupation of this outcast, reckless crowd. It is true many are Irish, but they are the people who do the hard work of this metropolis, who rear its huge edifices, pave and clean its streets, construct andkeepin order the multitudinous ducts of water, gas, and refuse; feed our hearths and minister to our daily wants. They are not the beggars, bat the porters at our doors. To their dirt, we owe our own cleanliness, and they are the szcaperms of a thousand pollutions. Yet there tbqeifester, untended, unheeded, all but unknown. Y;tilythey are uot quite unknown, HumanitT
struggles and protests. It sends cut it islsionaries, its ollicers of health. It publishes its reports. It forces on reluctant ears its sermons and its parables. It hunts out LzARZus in his alley, and follows DIvus to his country seat. Thanks to Dr. LETIEB1y and those who sent him on his errand, at all events we have the opportunity of seeing the dreadful story, not in a church window, but in the columns of the press.
Is there no moral from this contrast? Is the modern DIvGs guiltless because he runs away, and the modern LAzARus to be left alone because he hides in a corner his misery and his sin? Yet there is no city in the world like the City of London for its religion and its charities. There is no English city so well churched, so weU clergieo, so weeU bishoped, so well tithed, so well rated, so well charitied, so well armed with all the staff of long-established piety and ostentatious benevolence. Poverty, disease, and crime in this city are the material out of which whole classes are enriched. We have Unions to relieve them, hospitals to cure them, and clergy to convert them. So well secured are the higher influences that when a parish disappears its church remains, and, if there be no flock to tithe, the very soil and bricks maintain the pastor. There is no city in the whole world in which the aggregate expenditure for anl public purposes,-for government, for police, for charities, for schools, for churches, for clergy, for infirmaries and dispensaries,-comes at all near that of the city of London. Yet the result is the existence, and even the fresh growth, in the heart of this metropolis, and within the favoured borders of the " City," of these physical andmoralplaguenests. In the whole world, far away from the preaching of missionaries, there is rqo such utter brutishness, such grovelling and wallowing, as is discovered in the " Ward of Bishopsgate." DIvES is indeed wise in his generation to fly o' nights from such a foul proximity. When LAzARus has done his day's work and betakes himself to his sty he is a very unwholesome brute. Where he, his companions, and his cubs feed and litter, the dirt ferments, and the very air is envenomed. Dr. LETHEry has analyzed it, and found that it has lost its share of lifegiving power, and that it is charged, not only with more than its share of sluggish elements, but also with the vapours of death, and the very principle of putrefaction. Nature, which kindly dissipates this horrid efiluvium, and raises it from the lair where it is generated, diffuses it to the dwelling of the tradesman and the daily resorts of the merchant. They are made fearfully aware of a present pest: thoy hear with alaTm the advance of fever; they investigate its source, and find out a sink of crime. Such is the parable of our own city and our own times. If, as we believe, the case is worse, and the contrast more fagrant, than in the sacred page, the lesson is at least as plain and as fearful. Certainly there ought not to be such a state of things. Its existence is not only an evil,-it is a crime; and the crime is shared by all who can do anything to abate it, and leave that undone.
The close of the great electioneering contest has
The close of the great electioneering contest has been signalized by two events in remarkable accordance with the prevailing character of its results. Two defeats have been experienced where two victories might have been anticipated. In Flintshire Sir STEPHEir GLY,NE has been vanquished by Mr. Mos5TY, notwithstanding that Mr. GLADSTOHB filled every hamlet with his eloquence, and Welsh mobs were treated to set speeches which would have moved Westminster; and in another part of the United Kingdom Mr. BAnLiE CocmANE, with all the influence of the great Ducal. House of Hamilton at his back, has been beaten in Lanarkshire. It is extraordinary in how many instances the day has gone against the favourites. The most striking example to the contrary is Mr. GL.DsTonEo himself, who, after being driven in times past, and while in the plenitude of his popularity, to a stubborn fight for his seat at Oxford, has now been replaced in it without oppcsition at the very time that almost every other representative of his policy has been decisively rejected.
We observed at the commencement of the elections that if any particular element could then be thought disceraible as promising to affect the results, it was general independence-independence not merely with respect to influence or power, but as regarded parties and traditions too. There were few symptoms of political organizationi, and, though a great number of associated bodies urged their respective tenets on the notice of the electors at large, we see no evidence of success having attended their efforts; on the contrary, there has appeared everywhere a marked indisposition to submit to any kind of dictation, however disguised. The domination of the League at Manchester cost the old members their seats, and the poll was thus far consoling to the defeated parties, that its figures showed the determination of the constituency to recover their independence at any hazard or sacrifice whatever. In the metropolis, again, the belief that Lord Jonx RussXrL had been unfairly ostracized brought him a larger amount of support than his own direct appeals could probably have commanded. The same failure seems to have characterized the efforts of associations less immediately political. Omitting, the Tenant-right question, we doubt if the cry of any one society or league was found to produce any material results. The elections did not go upon Maynooth, or Church-rates, or the Ballot, or National Education, or any popular questions or objects embodied in party creeds. On some points, such as Parliamentary Reform, there will probably be found a large amount of general concurrence, but it was not as Parliamentary Reformers that candidates were elected. The polls took their complexion in a singular degree from the sense of the country, purely and simply exercised with as little reference as possible to the hobbies of one sect or another.
Here, however, arises an interesting question as to the consequences of such a decision. What is likely to be the character or disposition of a Parliament elected with such slight regard to ordinary Parliamentary strife ? We shall have a House of Commons with only two Peelites, with not one leader of the Mlanchester School, with many Conservatives who have no objection to Lord PAhrmsTow, and with a large majority representing general Liberalism. What will be the divisions in such an assembly? Will there be as much independence of party in the House as there was at the polling booths ? In some respects we think not; indeed, as far as speculation can be exercised on such a' subject, we are disposed to believe that the new House of Commons may be found somewhat simplified in its constitution, though not exactly in the fashion anticipated by
ref. DISRAL.
The complaint of the old school of politicians was, that parties had been spoilt by multiplication. The theory of the Constitution in this respect assumed that of two parties in the Legislature the stronger was, by virtue of that very fact, in possession of power, and that when its strength was lost, or appropriated by the other side, the victors took their turn of office and responsibility, as the victory itself had shown them cornpetent to do. When, however, parties were split and divided this regular alternation of Government becme impracticable, for an Admiistration mi#k be defeated by the union of setions pomsesg u mo real cohesion among themselves, nto ifAM aQi1na2leat 4;orbimatioa? aad vouNaeutlT
no power of assirmngthe offices for which they had I apparently disqualified others This was what
occurred on the China question. In the oldfashioned routine of afairs Lord PALMFRSTO2 would have resigned office to the leaders of the majority against him, and the result would simply have been a change of Government, which might or might not have been attended by a Disaolution. But this course was impossible when the leaders of the majority comprised the chiefs of half-a-dozen parties together, with views on many points irreconcileably different; and the question now is, whether there will in the new Parliament be fewer of these parties, so as to simplify the great divisions of the House and confine, as heretofore, the oscillations of power. We think this possible, and for the reasons following.
The multiplication of parties in the House has not arisen so much from the independence of individual members as the divisions of their chief leaders. What, in fact, were the principal elements of the late Parliament over and above those two which were represented in proper forr by Lord PAB ST oN and Mr. DIsBuw with their respective supporters ? There were first the Peelites, then the sympathizers with LordJonw Russ=, and finally the Manchester School, or Independents Proper. Now, for the first of these Mr. DIsBAEra is in himself responsible as much as anybody, for he deprived the Emperor of his army and left the General and his Staff in a position of isolation while he carried off the battalions. The second, too, is clearly traceable to persons rather than principles. In fact, the only considerable section of the House that might not, under ordinary circumstances, have been ranged in regular support of either,one side or the other is that to which Mr. COBDBN and Mr. BBrGHT gave a distinction of which it is now deprived. Parties were split up chiefly because Sir RoBnnT PE.'s polcy had rent the Conservative body asunder, and in a far less degree because the Liberal leaders, though without any real difference of principle, haddisagreements among themTelves. There was nothing unaccommodating or unmanageable in the general constitution of the House; indeed, the contrawy might be inferred frem the readiness with which not two, but half-a-dozen leaders, secured followings.
It is here that we think there may be a chance for simplification. We do not believe, as we have before remarked, that the members of the new House will enter it with any more definite or decided prepossessions in favour of pure Whig or pure Tory politics than were evinced by their predecessors; we should anticipate, indeed, rather an opposite result from the character of the elections and the nature of the returns. But, on the other hand,. some of the minor divisions of party may now be obliterated. With Protection utterly extinct, and the Peelite staff rudely scattered, this fragment of a political body will be absorbed in the two greater divisions, and, though we by no means desire or expect to see no independent party in Parliament, it is plain that the section especially distinguished by this title is not likely to preserve so decided a character as before. In a few words, as so many mrinor cries have been extinguished and so many celebrities will ba missed, there must needs be more space for the development of those two great divisions which are said to be based upon the instincts of nature itself. There may be a good deal of personal independence, but not much tendency to the formation of cliques. Neither Lord PAnennTo-r nor
Mr. DISRELI will be able to command a blind subservience in the name of Whiggism or Toryism, but good measures will obtain support, with fewer chances of interruption than before; and, if this should be the case, we do not think the prospect a bad one either for the Administration or the country.

The New Organization Of The Russian Army.

BERULI, ArRIL 5.
A weIl-known military author has said "I!Nothing recurs in military matters xo inevitably as a change of uniforn's on the commencement of a new rein, and the re-o -azation of the army at the end of a long war.' The correctness of this remark has lately been evi.enfed in Rbssia.
Almost immedlately after the death of the Emperor Nicholas therv ensued, although in the middle of a war, a thorough change in the Russian uniforms. The polidaftan (a tunia such as our own military now wears, in imitation of the Pruuian woffenrock) was introduced; the helmet was for the moat part got rid of, the uniforms of the officers was simplified, ahnost tD unbecomingness, by the abolition of epaulettes and of shes and tassels, besides a variety of other changes ram4e. It was no secret that the present Emperor, even during his father's lifetime, had, as Grand Duke, devoted a considerable amount of attention to the subject of uniforms. An album containing drawings of uniforms for each separate arm of the service was spoken of as being in existence, and as haTing been, from time to time, shown to foreign offlces who happened to be at St. Petersburg. That even the Emperor Nicholas himself had at one time the intention of introducing the plaschtsch, or Russian paletot, after the cut of the French caban, as a sort of half-eloak or surtout, may be inferred from a well-known statuette which represents the Emperor in this costume. In his lifetime, however, the introduction of tho tunio probably was prevented by financial considerations, masmuch as in a matter of nearly a million of uniforms it would have required several millions of ells of cloth. With the accession of the Emperor Alexander IL, however, this reason seems to have lost its force; orders were given for the introduction of the polukaftan throughout the army, and those orders were executed even without waitingfor. the return of peace. And thus the Russian army presents at present a totaly different appearance from what it did during the late war.
More important than this mere alteration of externals is the very thorough change in the orgauization of the whole army, which, by the breaking up of the special or separate Dragoon corps and the attachment of its component regiments to the light divisions of the various arme corps, has resumed almost the same form of constitution as it possesd at the death of Alexander I., with this difference, however, that at that time there still existed regiments of mounted Jagers, which have since then been entirely done away with in the Russian army.
The alterations that have been effected in the Russian army are of two kinds-first, those which have simply abolished orgauizations introduced by the Emperor Nicholas; and, secondly, those which were called for by the progres of experience and development of science in modern warfare, two classes that may be characterized respectively as repeal and reform. To the latter class belongs the great increase and improved distribution of the Rifles (sharpshooters); to the first the reduction, we may almost say the abolition, of the " Reserve Cavalry Corps." This body, in its present form, consists only of the eight regiments of the Cuirassiers of the Line, with the Mounted Artillery and the Mounted Pioneers, which remain attached to them; but up to the commencement of the late war the entire " Reserve Cavalry Corps" consisted of-
1. A Light Division of the Reserve Cavalry, consisting of two regiments of Lancers, two of Hussars, and three of Dragoons.
2. Two Divisions of Cuirassiers, consisting of eight regiments.
3. One Divison of Lancers, consisting of four regiments.
4. Two Divisions of Dragoons, consisting of eight regiments.
A ninth regiment of Dragoons was then and is still stationed in the Caucasus.
To the above were attached 12 mounted batteries composing three divisions of mounted artillery.
Of this Reserve Cavalry Corps, consisting, as it formerly did, of 27 regiments, there remain, as mentioned above, only eight regiments of Cuirassiers, with four batteries and a division of Mounted Pioneers.
Under the Emperor Nicholas this corps of cavalry was cantoned to the south of Moscow in Orel, Wossmessensk, Tschugujeff, &c., and was au object of special interest and admiration to the military world. The grand field days andcmanceuvres which it performed in 1837 revealed a splendid and unique creation-one that seems tobe possible onlyin Russia. What on that occasion more particularly riveted attention was the special, or separate, Draooon Corps, consisting of eight regiments, of 12 squadrons each; in this creation of the Emperor Nicholas strategists believed they detected an intention on his part to introduce on to the battle field in any future war a new, or, at any rate, a fresh applicstion of an old element. The original destination of Dragoons to serve both as cavalry and infautry, or, in other words, to be a mounted infantry, was intended by him to be revived in this special corps of Dragoons. The regiments that composed it-the regiments of the Dragoons of the Guard and of the Mlounted Grenadiers of the Guard-were so organized that on dismounting they each of them formed a complete battalion (or, as we say, regiment) of infantry. Of the 12 squadrons that composed a reginent 10 were distinguished from the rest as " active," one as reserve, and one as supplementary. Among the 10 "active" squadrons there were two of pikemen, that always remained mounted, and thus the eight regiments of Dragoons in their partially dismounted organization formed eight battalions (regiments) of infantry, of eight companies each, together with 16 squadrons of mounted pikemen. By a further subdivision of every squadron into dismounters and horse-holders these eight battalions were always provided with eight detachments of troops, that remained mounted and held the horses of those that dismounted; and to the whole body was attachedabatteryof flying artiUlery. The armament of the Dragoons consisted of an infantry musket with a bayonetand a cavalry sabre; andside bysidewith the trumpeters there marched also a proper complemea.t of drummers, so that theDragoons, once dismounted. could operate in every way like infantry. Everythinga that the most eareful drilling and training could effect bad been attained by this corps of Dragoons, and therewerefair gronndsfor expecting very remarkable results from the application of such an unusual force-one which conld not do otherwise than take the enemy by surprise.
Nevertheless, throughout the whole of the campaign in Hungary, in 1849, this corps of Dragoons was in no way enmployed by the Emperor, although there were not wantiagopportunities of putting this hobby-force that he bad cherished and cultivated for 15 years to the test of the battle field; nor even when the Russian forces entered Moldavia in 1853 were there any of these Dragoons among them. It was not till the Oriental war had attained its subsequent large dimensions that the corps of Dragoons was called out for active service, and that, too, not excepting the 11th and 12th squadrons (reserve and supplementary) of every repgiment. }Jut even on this occasion it was not called out to act as an enti e body, but was split up into parts. The 4th and 8th Regiments (New Russia and Twer) were detached from the corps, and despatched tc the theatre of war in Lesser Asia, for the purpose of reinforcing the
onIy regiment of regular cavalry (the 9th Dragoons) that was attacheda to the separate Caucasian corps; and of the six regiments that remained behind for the protection of the coasts of the Black Sea and the Crimea none of them came into contact with the enemy. The question, therefore, of whether the peculiar hybrid organization of this corps of Dragoona would have ever realied the expectations entertained of it must now for ever remain unanswered by any practical test, inasmuch as in the recent reorganization of the army this peculiar corps, as was mentioned above, has been broken up, its nine component regiments have been separated from the Reserve Cavalry Cors, and have been converted into 1S regiutents, which have been formed again into nine brigades.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-If "your own correspondent" had been in these parts during the last fortnight, and had sent you a faithfal record of tho sayings and doings of tho right hon. member for the University of Oxford, the account would have been highly entertaing to your numerous reders. That right hon. gontleman has not considered it beneath his dignity as a Privy Councillor to go about the county of Flint as an itinerant advocate of his brother-in-law, Sir Stephen Glyn, the Tory and Tractarian candidate for that county, and to d-al out, in public streets and public buildings, to such mob audiences as he could collect, the great things he wouldI do if ho were again in power, and to heap upon Lordl Palmerston personally, and upon his Government, an amount of abuse whicb even Mr. Ernest Jones or any otber Chartist leader would have been reluctant to utter. He endeavoured to blind and astonish his hearers by the most bold and daring financial statements, by abusing the present Government as recklessly extravagant, by accusing Lord Palmerston of tricks in the Cabinet, and of expellng him and one or two others out of it "neck and shoulders," and by showving that the existence of such a Government as that of the noble lord would produce no other results to the country than increased taxation rud a continuanco of the most shameless expenditure of the public money. But though he exerted his oratory to the utmost, it was evident that the impression produced fel far short of what he auticipated, and that his e2oquence and reasoning powers were greatly below what was expected. His mode of utterance verified in a remarkable manner the correctness of the observations contained in a leading article of The Aiema a few days ago, irn which a truthful comparison was drawn between him, Mr. Disraeli, and Lord Palmerston ; for nothing could be more observable than the " wordy' mode in which he clothed his sentiments, and the sophism and casuistry which he introduced into the argumentative portion of his speechesHe doubtless expecteA that him celebrity as a debater aud his name would produce a favourable effect in North. Wales, and so inmsure the defeat of Mr. Mostyn, the Government candidate; butthe contrary has been the case, for it was impossible for any man possessing a great name, coming to a part of the country where he was not previously personaly known, to lower himself in the opinion of the public to the extent which Mr. Gladstone has done within so short a time. At many of the public meetings in Flintshire and at Liverpool he was confronted and badgered by Methodist preacbers, mechanics, and others rising up in the crowd, with the most damaging effect; and how any one possessing his reputation could have subjected himself to such an ordeal was a matter of surprise to every one who witnessed the humiliation which he underwent. In a speech made by the hon. member for Anglesey on his re-election the other day, he designated Mr. (ladstone as bazy in politics and doubtful in religion, and in the addresses made when he was present at some of the Flintshire meetings hb was held up as a" political coward," a "misty politician," an " unfaithful public servant," &c., all which. shows the estimate in which the right hon. gentleman is held by thoseinNorth Wales who have had an opportunity of hearing from himself and of judging from his own statements what he realy is, and the poor display be made on the nomination at Flint on Saturday last created a still more unfavourable impression of his powers and talents on. the minds of the thousands asserabled on that occasion.

A pon L of the fo1owing appeared in our second odl-
tion of yeseda I:-
PARMS, ArRIL 7, 6 P.aL
The Neuchatel Conference did not sit to-day, as expected. Notice was sent out on Sunday to the Plenipotentiaries for a meeting on Tuesday, but a counter-order was subsequently given, doubtless because the expected instructions were not received from Berne or Berlin, or perhaps from both places. The difficulty, it appears, turns on the question of money-the amount, not the principle of indemnity, which latter is said to be admitted.
The two principal grievances alleged by the Austrian against the Sardinian Government are, it appears, the provocations offered by the political reiagees in Piedmont, and the fortification of Alessandria, and until these cease it is pretended that there will be no reconciliation. The Austrian Consuls in Piedmont have, however, received orders from Vienna to remain at their posts, and to continue as hitherto in the performance of their duties. The circular in which these instructions are contained is couched in reassuring terms.
The following document, purporting to be a desDatch addressed to the Viceroy of Canton by the Chfef of the Council of the Emperor of China, has been received here from Macao:-
"Yeh! I have serious news to announce to you. We have read with attention the account you have givon us of the attack by the English barbarians. The Nuy-Ko were unsnimous in their indignation at it, and we determined that the Emperor should be informed of it, notwith. standing the pain it occasions his magnanimous heart, and these are the commands of his mighty will:-Yeb, you are to carry on a war of extermination against the forelgn barbarians who have attacked you. Theymustreceive from you an exemplary chastisement. Yet, after the vengeance shall have been doemed suffioient by you, and if they manifest sincere repentance for what they have done, the Emperor, our magnanimous Sovereign, who is inundated with floods of light, consents that hostilities shall coaso, and that commercial affairs shall be resumed with these foreigners as they existed previous to their fault.
" Yeh, you will take heed, and you will communicate the preceding to the Mandarins placed under your orders.

A private letter from Vienna of the 5th mentions that a telegraphic despatch had been received from the Danubian Provinces, to the effect that the Ottoman Government had consented to the evacuation of the Principalities, and that the departure of the Turkish troops was expected to commence on the 10th inst. The utmost tranquillity prevailed tbere.
Advices from Toulon state that the arrival of the Grand Duke Constantine was fixed for the 22d April. Preparations were going on very actively in the port and arsenal for the reception of the Prince, which is intended to be very brillant. A squadron of war steamers will set out to meet the Russian squadron which accompanies the Grand Duke.
The following is the judgment given by the Council of State in the case of Monseigneur de Dreux-Br6ze, Bishop of Moulins:-
'Napoleon, by tho Grace of God and the nationml will Emperor of the French, to all whom these presents may concern greeting.
" On the report of the Section of Laws, Justice, and Foreign Affairs:
" Considering the appeal for abuse of power presented to us in our Council of State of the 3d of March, 1857, by our Minister of Worship, against several administrative acts of he Bishop of Moulins, particularly against,-
" 1. The fact of having exacted from several cur6s of his diccese a written and signed renunciation of their right to take advantage of their ilnmoveability, and to have recourse to the civil authority, in case the Bishop should think proper to revoke or ehange them for serious and canonical reasons;
" 2. Against the synod?61 statute pronouncing excommunication ipso facto, and without previous intimation, agaiast ell those who apply to the secular power to claim its support in anything which concerns the jurisdiction, the statutes, pastoral letters, and other ccleslastical prescriptions or regulations in matters of benefices, titles, doctrine, or discipline;
"3. Against the constitution of the Chapter of theCathedral Church of Moulins, made without the intorvention of the clvil authority, and in contravention of the special ordinance of October 29, 1823;
"Considering the inquiry institutead by the Profect of the Aliier on the 28th of February, and the 1st, 2d, and Gth of March, 1857;
"Considering Chapter IIL of the statutes of thesecond synod of the diocese of Moulins--De judicUs; Daenon apedlando ad sncularemr potatem,-the said statutes pii. ted at Moulins by Dssrosiers and Sons, printers to the bishopric, In tho year 1855;
"Considering the capitular constitutions of the Cathedral Church of Moulins, printed in the above statutes;
" Considering the Ordo divini offici,pablished and printed In 1&56 by the same printers, containing the present composition of the said Chapter;
" Considering the letter of the 3d of March last, by which our Minister of Pablic Instruction gave notice to the Bishop of Moulins of the above-mentioned appeal;
" Considering the letter sent by the Bishop in reply to our Mfinister, dated the 8th of the same month;

" Considering Art. 10 of the Convention of the 26th Messidor, An 9;

Considering the docree of the 28th of February, 1810:
"On the first count :-Considering that in exacting from soveral curds, before their installation, a written and signed zenuncic.ion of applying to the civil authloriiy, in case ho (the Bishop) should tbink proper to dismiss them for grave and canonical causes, tho Bishop of Moulins has committed an excess of power, a contravention of the laws of the State, and an attack on the liberties, franchises, and customs of the GaUican Church.
"On the second count:-Considering that the appeal to the civil authority is established for ecelesiastics, as for all other citizens, in the intereet of justice, of protection, and of public order, and which should be exercised freely and with all security of conscience; that consequently the interdiction of appeal to the secular power for facts which come within its competency, under pain of excommunication ipso facto and without previous intimation, also constitutes an excess of power, a contravention of the laws of tho empire, and an attack on the liberties, franchises, and eustows of the Gallican Church;
" On the third count:-Consdering that in modifying, without the authorization of the Government, the constitution of the Chapter of the Cathedral of Moulins, such as at had been established by the statutes approved by the Royal ordinance of the 29th of October, 1823, the Bishop of Moulins has exceeded his powers and acted in contravention of article 35 of the law of 18 Germinal, An 10;

The Piedmmtese Gazette gives the following ac-
count of the King of Sardinia's stay at Nice on the 1 1st and 2d inst.:-
" After receiving the visit of the Grand Duke Constau. tine and the Prince of Wurtemburg, His Majesty went, in company with the Prince de Carignan, to pay a visit to the Empress Dowager of Russia, who invited him to partake of a breakfast, Her Majesty's sons and the Grand Duches Hlelena being among the guests. In the afternoon the King gave audience to the chief authorities of the town, and then proceeded to the Villa de Orestis to pay his respects to the Grand Dachess Olga. In the evening the towa was splendidly illuminated. The King attended a soirsc given by the Empress, where Madame Bosio sang several pieces in Italian and French. On the following day His Majesty gave a grand dinner to the authorities."
A letter from Leghorn says that the Grand Duke Constantine visited Elba on the 26th, and sought out with the greatest apparent interest all vestiges of the residence of the Emperor Napoleon I. iis
Imperial Highness afterwards left for the Court of I Tuscany.
A letter from Florence of the 31st of March informs us
"That tle Marquis llidolfi, late Professor of Agrioul. ture at Pisa and subsequently Minister in 1848, is abont to open a gratuitous public course of agricultural lectures at Empoli every Sunday after Divine service. This' useful example, given by a nobleman such as the Minister Ridol.i, together with the clever treatise lately read by MI. Lambrusohini before the Academy of Georgofili on the subject of agricultural education, and the plan which the Academy proposes to sabmit to the Government, will induce it to reestablish, it is hoped, the course of instruct ion which was suppressed in 1851, when the University of Pisa was divided; which will be the more easy, as the Government has gained nothing by the suppression of the course ofinstrmc. tion which was effected through a system of economy. M. Cappal, the professor, who was brought from Sicily, hasretained his full pay, and as the Government( did not venture to sell the model farm at Pisa it was leased to i. Czipai
whohas farmed it for his own benefit. Wh en the rent became due the Treasury would not receive it, and M. Cappai deposited it in the savings-bank. The Academy of Georgofili aecomplishes with remarkable activity the mission it has undertaken, to prepare useful reforms by scientific zesearches. Thus M. Cini has by his writings saved Tuseany for some years from a Customs union with Austra. He has since published a treatise on the necessity of a monetary reform in Tuscany and its advantags, together with the means by which this measure, which cannot be retarded without serious injury to the country, is to be executed. Another academy, the Italian Atheneum, has likewise, after a long silence, assumed a vigorous attitude. At its last sitting Monsignor Tabarini delivered an interesting discourse on historical studies in Italy, and on the principles according to which a history of the peninsula should be written. The Italian press likewise, though reduced to literary and scientific arguments, declares itself sometimes a s the organ of public opinion with respect to the subject of Italian nationality and the principles it would wish to see adopted in the councils of the Government. There is a considerable number of small journals which, though they are mostly oceu' pied witb theatrical subjects and romances, nev er lose an opportunity of alluding to political subjects, and always in a liberal and Italian spirit, which entails on them from time to time a suspension on the part of Signor Landucci and his agents."

TURI, APRIL 4.
The circular of Count Buol of the 16th of last month, by which he recalled the Austrian Legation from this Court, has now been republished by all the papers here, but as yet without comment on their part. It would seem that the spirit of this document had become so well known long before the publication of the text that all argument was exhausted, or otheiwise it is difficult to account for such unusual silence,particularly at a moment when the press is suffering from a most ruinous dearth of political news. It is certain thatthowithdrawal of the Austrian Legation had been so long expected here that, 'when actually carried into execution, it caused neither surprise nor excitement. No questions have been addressed to the Ministers in Parliament on the subject-the newspapers accepted it as a matter of course after the diplomatic correspondence of the previous month,-and thepublic received the inteligence with indifference. The affair has given rise to much more controversy in other countries than it has here, and I believe that if it were not for the continued menacing tone of the official and semi-official Austrian papers the Piedmontese would soon cease to think of it; but of course those mysterious threats of the Austrian press as to the ulterior measures that the mighty empire of Austria may be forced to adopt towards this pigmy kingdom tend to rouse feelings which Count Buol professes to desire should be calmed. With all this however, there is no excitement on the subject in 'iedmont, 'where people are able to judge of the true state of the case by the aid of a free press; but such is not the case in other Italian States, 'where the Austrian view is the only one allowed free circulation. The Vienna Cabinet having committed a great political blunder,it is thought necessarythatthe journalsof the empire should represent it as determined to proceed against the Sardinian Government with firmness and vigour, &c., and this is precisely the style of language calculated to inflame the imagination of all the hot hea'ls in Italy, and insure the repetition of such acts as your Vienna correspondent reports to have occurred at Venice on the 23d of last mouth. The military authorities in Lombardy would of course be very glad of an excuse for martial law being declared, as it would place the government of the country virtually in their hands again, and probably a blockade of the Piedmontese frontier might be much to the taste of General Gyulai ; but one can hardly suppose that it is by such means that the Vienna Government hopes to rmake loyal subjects of the Lombardo-Venetiau3, and yet both its acts of late years and at the present time justify the conclusion that such events are not improbable.
The King of Sardinia returned to his Palace of PolUenzo last night from Nice.
'The Sienate met to-day and passed a Bill for the

NAPLES, ArDDL 2.
It is not often that Lord Pablerston is " sold" but he has been sold, nay, more, knockeed down this week. The event took place at the sale of the late Sir
William Temple's effects, where a splendid engraving I of his Lordship was bought by a gentleman o. Modena, established in Naples, for the small sum of 15 ducats. The frame was worth more than 13 ducats, so that the Prime Minister -,vent cheap. There are tens of thousands in Naples and Italy who -would have rejoiced to have the likenes-
of a man by whose name they swear, but the NeapoLitans were afraid to bid; even such an inciden: as this would have been noted. The terror which his name inflicts here may bi judged from the fact that a circular has been goinr the round of the judges in the provinces, warhing them that an enissary of Palmerston is in. the country. The signs bv which he may be recognized are given, aid:orders are issued not to molest him but to watch well all with whom he has any contact. Every Englishman must feel that no higher compli ment could be paid to his Lordship than to be feared and hated by the Neapolitan Govgrnment. How different the fate which awaits my lord Derby heret It is felt that he has sympathies -with this Government. His speech of the 17th of March, translated into French, is now on my table; 20,000'co pie3 of it, I am told, have' been printed; and they are being distributed right and left. The moral effect of this will be very bad. The Government use3 this unhappy speech as a silent approbation of its3 policy, and severely will the liberals suffer for, the nowly acquired strength which arbitrary power has received from Lord Derby. The reports of an adjustment of the difficulties betwieen this Government and, those of the allies have died away again, though it is said that since the first. failure other propositions3 have beeii made. The agent of whom I spoke about 10 days since was, I have reason to'sus. pect, a gentlemia soni time since resident in Sicily, but who, having' sola his property, has retired into Gernany. Thb telegraphic despatch which was to ba sent on his arrival to the Minister for Foreign Affairs has arrived, and is to the effect that at Paris he had been well receivea aud listened to. Much caution will be required in treating with a Government like this, which is an adept in all the arts of deception, and which has alrqadly thown that no promises can bind it. Again, great caution will be needed lest any arrangement so called, may leave matters in a worse position tiianthey were in before. For nearly a year the Liberal party has been waiting in suspense to see what France and England would do. If it should be seen that they have betrayed the hopes of the Neapolitans be asured that the same course of agitation and conspiracy will be entered on. The Neapolitans have been kept down but never subdued, as their frequent revolutions attest. There is great t of fitting out several other vessels in addition to those already commissioned, and devoting them to changing the garrisons of the two parts of the kingdom. It is a fancy of my own that in this way the Government may attempt to conceal the check which its plan of transportation has received
and endeavour to give the idea that from the fir t Its little armament had quite a different object. From the first the Argentine expedition has been highly unpopular among all classes, and, in spite of what some foreign journals may assert, but few political prisoners have accepted the offers made. My information may be depended on. The change of the garTisons, which has not taken place for several years, is said in military circles to be decided upon, as the " garrison at Naples is becoming too insolent." It is added that the Royal Guard now on duty in Caserta will come to Naples, and that the Swiss, with the Artillery, will go to Caserta. The soldiers have now nearly completed their " spiritual exercises," and I have it from undoubted authority that efforts have been made to give a political direction to the inquiries of the confessors, many officers having given the names of various soldiers whom they suspected. By the same authority I ari informed that several priests refused to be made the tools of- the Government. Major Granetta, of the 3d battalion of Rifles, to which Milano belonged, has- been-sent under arrest to the Castle.
A Council of War has been for some time investigating the causes of the explosion of the Carlo Terzo, and it has just now come to the conclusion that it knows nothing at all about them. Notwithstanding, the officers attached to the vessel have by superior orders been all degraded to the fourtha class, which is equivalent to a dismissal from the service. The legal mode of procedure would have been to try them by court-martial ; but law has no force in a country when arbitrary power directs and controls everything.
His Majesty came into Naples on Monday after-- noon to visit his aunt the Princess of Salerno. It is the first visit he has paid to the capital since the beginning of January. The King, who, I understand, did not choose to come by the railway, was accompanied by some. of the Royal princes in two open carriages, and escorted by a picket of cavalry. His Majesty left almost immediately on his return to Caserta. The following placard, which I translate and send, has been put into my hands. I give it as a portion of the history of the times, without adopting the sentiments. It is said to come from Palermo, and you can conceive how violent, however concealed, must be the spirit which adopts such a mode of expression:

"Brothers !-Oar tyrant, with a ferocity without comparison, ever oppresses us more heavily. He declares a war of extermination against us. He slays us, our wiyes, our children, our friends, in the midst of tortures. No longer i; it a lust of power which moves him, but a thirst for bloodoffspring'of a vile vindictiveness. Neapolitans I for ex. treme evils wo must adopt extreme remedies. Of what u e ismoderation? Ferdinand II. is crime personified. All that belongs to him is corrupt. The tree must fall with Its branches. Every law grants us the right of legitimate defence. Repel, then, the sword with the sword, tho dagger with the dagger-life for life. Thus only can we be safe. Brothers, begin; we will follow you; let us continue the work initiated by the magnanimous but too unfortumate Milano and Bentivenga. God Will assist us, or if we fall we shall not die unrevenged. Noble Neapolitans, if our oppressor makes a show of changing his system do not believe him; he is a perjured traitor; our misfortunes will know no end during his life. Pardon his young wolves, yes; but him, or tho perfidious Austrian, never. Nob thoughts of bloid, brothers, bat desperation inspires these sentiments. L t the infamy of them fall upon the monster who drives a people to such excesses. Up, then ! Let us give a hand to the work, and thus let us teach kings to remember that they are men, and to the people to finish f r ever with their tyrants. Long live Italian unity.

Hlowever much a calmly-judging person may regret the strength of expression employed in this placard and the principles insinuated, the spirit which prompted them is no less a fact-it
exists and has been evoked by years of injustice and cruelty. Let no one imagine,
therefore, that a mere patchwork arrangement wiU quell that spirit. The Neapolitan question is as simple as it can be-it lies in a nutshell-it is one
of hunmanity and of guarantees; laws, institutions, Governmental machinery Neapolitans have in perfection, but all are paralyzed.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, Wednesday, April 8.
COURT OF BA2 7RUPTOY, , Basmghall-street,
Wedne-day, April 8.
IN' RE THE ROYAL BRl5TRIT V..,;
(Berore Afr. TT- ? - ,
This was a meeting for the esamination of the Ho.T John Stapleton, formerly a director of the bank, and no W` LP. for Berwick-on.Tweed.
Mr. Linldater appeared for the assignees, and Mr. Hiddleston and lr. Freshfield for Mr. Stapleton. Mr. J. Simon appeared to watoh the proceedings on behalf of Mr. Hugh aInes Cameron, late manager of the bank.
31r. Stapleton, examined, said he becamo a director on the 24th of July. Did not know by whom he was proposed as a director. On reference to minutes of tho 21st of July he found he was proposed by Mr. X.leod, and sec6nded by AMr. Esdaile. It was proposed by a gentleman in the city that he should join; and, having time disengaged, ie thought it desirable. MIr. Cameron then stated that the bank was virtualUy paying 12 per cent., 6 per cent.being carried to a reserve fond. He also said that new shares were being taken, aud that the shares had been taken up readilybythepublic. Hedidnot learnthat Cameronwas Largely indebted to the bank, nor that Mr. Humphrey Brown was a debtor, nor of Mullins's debt nor of the Welsh works. The directors did not inform him of this. They allowed him to come in with9ut making any communication upon the subject of the accounts. He subsequentlyyexpremsed himself dissatisfied at the course they had pursued.
Te had *armly complained more with reference to Camoron thanwith reference to the directors of being deceived. He was not appointed one of the directors by the general meeting of the 3d Qf August of that year; he was appodlted a director by the Court of Directors, which was sabsequent to that meeting. He was not ap. 1poiuted by the proprietors umtil February. On the 31st of Julyhe accepted the office of director, and signed the ordi. nary declaration of secrecy. Shortly after he went to Scotand,-it was not on a shooting excursion, but on a visit to Sir James Matheson. He saw Mr. Percival and Mi. Cameron there. He had read a letter in the newspapers from Esdaite to Cameron, dated the 17th of September, 1855..;
The letter was produced, from whichrwo take the follow irg extracts:-
"I waaspleased to se your hanD-writing from UEdlnbul, and the fceling of pleaanre was enbalced by the somewhat les doubtful prospectyon hold outot Eir J. Mlsaccedon.

"Wuhing onu high health anduccoess In your sport, he tb6 xame what it may. I rernain, &."
He knew nothing about thatletter at that time. He recollected Mr. Esdaile caming to him and telling him that Mr. Cameron hoped that he would induce Sir James Matheson to join the bank and to become its chairman, and he quite laughed at the idea, as he knew that Sir James only came to town to attend Parliament. He had read some letters of lMr. MTheod's.
lr. LINXLAI.xu then read the following letter
Itoyal British Bank Tokeahone-Yard, Lothbury, Oct. 2, lSS.
Dear Mr. Manager,-Y6ur letterfrom DingweUi of the 30th ult. and the baunch of veniTno'aarived here safely thiB morning.

*Believe me yours very truly,
H. IL D. MILEOD."
Mr. L N-ATx.-Now, does that letter call to your recollection the fact that shortly prior to October the 25th there -was considerable uneasiness in the mind of yourself and the other directors of the bank t
Mr. Stapleton.-Not in my mind. At that time I knew nothing at all about tho affairs ef the bank. It was not until very recently that I became aware of the contents of this letter. Allow me to explain. About the middle of the day we had lunch in a separato room, and then I and another went out, and it is possible that something night have been said or done while I was out at lunch of which I was totally ignorant until I looked at this record; and I have not the remotest recollection of any thing that was done upon that occasion.
MIr. Lu~KLN;IAT .-It wvas something singular to find at a S cisl court of directors no entry in the minute-book at Mr.-Stapleton.-I did not makeup the minute-book; that wasmaude up subsequently by Mr. Paddison.
Examination continued.-Ee did not look at the book, although it was lying on the table, as it was new to him, having just joined the concern. That book showed the state of the account at the Bank of England. He could not say wvhen his attention was first called to Mr. Humphrey Brown's account, but he -believed it WaS in November or Decemnber. It would be from hearing itcasually mentioned in thfe board-room. He complained to Owen, and .sid if Mr. Owen would move for a committee he would second it. De Tape's account had been mentioned about this time, and something had been said about the Welsh works. A special committee on the Welsh works was appointed. Cameron was the geueral manager, and he wvas in the habit of corresponding with HumphreyBrown and others whohad accounts with the bank.
Mr. LINXLATBR here read from a letter dated the 26th of November, 1855, from Mr. Cameron to Mr. H. Brown, marked "private," and commencing " My dear Mr. Brown:-

"At the end of iast year the balance at yolr debit ondrawing account here was £i13,63 3s. and your past due bills amounted to £Lo-5 forming together a debt of £21,693 is., exclusive of £5,561 lS. 3d ci current bill.

That resolution was 'his composition. The sum rentioned by Cameron w-s 77,0001. or so.
Mr. IJNKI.TEIl.-That rather startled you, I presume ?
MIr. Stapleton.-Well, it did.
M1r. jLinLATv .-And it Eomewhat alarmed you, did it not ?
Mr. Stapleton.-It did.
Mr. LI?IKLATEP-I supposo you learned what mortgages you held of H. Brown?
Mr. Stapleton hero stated the'mortgages which the bank held. - He found with reference to several of the ships of which they held the mortgages that they had been previouely mortgaged. Mr. Browvn always promised that he
would seo to this matter when he camoeto To_wn to attend to
his Parllamentary dutier, when he would assign over all his property to tho bank, except his household furniture. Ho could not say that the securities were insufficient to cover the advances to the extent of 30,0001. Some of these ships had been previously mortgaged.
Mr. IumLATER.-Did you not tako any pains to inquire whether these vessels were free or not at that time ?
M1r. Stapleton.-How could I inquire I
3fr. IThKLATEIn.-By searching the register. Mr. S tapleton,-I never did that.
Mr. L vxniTESR.-With your legal knowledgo dlid you, not consider it prudent to do so.? -
Mr. Staplbton.-I was under the impression that Mfr.
Brown was a person of some respectability. In fact, if we I hbd eent down to search the register we should have struck a bloW at his credit, to avoid which my predeccsaors had not-registersdthexn. I was not ronl the direction At that time. If Ihad been Ishould no bave taken themortgagee.

Examination continacd.-At that time the bank was not in a favourable position-he thought itO difficulties might be overcome. He signed the certificate of the 16th of January to tho Board of Trade, representing' that the third thousand shares had been oompleted, and the 50 paid up. He was anxious at that time to get the certificate from the Board of Trade, so that they m-ight publish their paid-up capital at' the halfyearly meeting of the 3d of Februay. On the 29th of January a resolution of the Board was come to to declare a dividend of 64 per cent. per annum. Mr. H. Brown was not present at that meeting, bnthe was on the 15th and the 22d of January. He'did not recollect Mr. H. Brown stating that it was not right to send forth a balance-sheet to the public which stated that providon had been made for bad debts. He did not recollect altering tbe report which had been prepared by the general meeting. De Tape's aotmnt' bad occupied his attention at the committeo on convertible Securities. He found that Do Tape -was indebted to the bank between 30,0001. and 40,0001., and he was under considerable apprehensions about it.
M1r. LINkLATEIt.-H&ving regard to Mr. HM Brown's debt of 77,0001., Mr. De Tape's and Mr. Rigby's of 40,0001. -these two alone-perhaps you wiM tell us how much provision you had made for bad debt;s in the half-year enda ing thec 31st of December, 1855 ? en
Mr. Stapleton.-I eannat tell you.
Mr. Lm'xrTEB..-Some thousands?7
aIr. Stapleton.-I really do not know, but I suppose a few thousands,
Ir. L MTzR.-Then, if I tll 'you that the totl amountjof provision for the half-year was 339. 17s, you would be s*rprised ?
M Zr. Stapleton.-I should be.
ir. LdWRLATEP.-If the general ledger states it you would have mo doubt about it ?
Mr. Stapleton.-I suppose not.
Examination coatinuecl.-4The Above sadvance, including advances also to the Welsh works, were About 190,0001 These Advances alarmed him at the time. He thought it 'was a nasty affair. These secuLrities were incon'vertible, but he never opened his lips on the Subject, aa it was not his province. On February the 5th, he was appointed deputy. govemior. On that day Advertisements were ordered to be msued in the EngIlsh and Scotch papers of the intention of the boardI to issue new sbares at a premium of Ui. Soon after this he f-rt became aware of Mr. Cameron's acoount,
ad he told Mr. O~wen that he very much disapproved the general manager having a loan from the bank, anud M1r. Owen concurred with him. Hle did not look at the grn ledger until he became deputy-governor.
31r. LUTXLATER.-HavJog become deputy-governor the volume was open to you. . (A laugh).
Mr. Stapleton.-It was; and I then found how Mr. Cameron's account stood.
Mr. LISmTAEiB-You found him to be indebted to the bank between 20,0001. and 30.0001.. without security?
Mr. Stapleton.-In a considerable sum. The securities held 'were of the value of about 3,0001.
Mr. 1,1:n.TEP-And that 'was worse than All the rest'?
Mr. Stapleton.-It was far the worst.
Mr. LJNXATmR.-Did yon not say to Mr. Esaile and to the rest of the friends who had helped you into the bank that it was a very scandalous proceedingl
Mr. Stapleton-I expressed myopinion upon the saubject. Mr. LnUCrATEeR-I will not say in unmeasured terms, but with some indignation ?
3Mr. Stapleton.-In a propermanner.
3Mr. LlhKL&Tr.-But with some indignation7 Mr. Stapleton.-If you like. Mr. LmrL&TEm-Is it so?
Mr. Stapleton.-I did complain.
Mr. LINsLATML-IVth some indignation?
Mr. Stapleton.-I don't know what you mean by " some indignation."
Mr. HUDDLESTON.-Mr. Stapleton does not know 'what you mean by " indignation."
Mr. LUMATmu.-Ferhaps you 'will tel him. (Loud laminationecontinued.-Mr. OUver's account came to his knowledge in the month of Febra ry, 1856. and there was an anticipated loss of a large sum, but he did not think to the amount of 13,0001. Having access to the green ledger ho became aware that Mr. M'Gregor was indebted to the bank, and that there must a loss of some thousands by him. About this time he became aware of the wife of Mr. R. Blacker, for whom they haddiscounted bills,having informed the bank that many of the bills were fictitious, and he 'was aware that there must have been a 10s3 of 3,0001. or 4,0001. by those bills. He could not say how it was that while losses had been incuarred to so large an amount, only A sum of 300 odd pounds had been put to the account for bad debts. Although he was a member of the bar he did not consider that this was a legal question, but a banking question.
Mr. LmiNKTATm.-But youx had rcoently purchased a banking dictionary ? (Laughter.)
Mr. Stapleton. I had not purchased It.
Examination continued.-He was aware of the 71st clause of the charter in respect of the bank ceasing business when the bank lost one-fourth of its capital. Mr. Cameron had about this time tbroatened to call the attention of the Court because he had been dismisssd
A letter was here read, signed by witness, Esdaile, and Kennedy of the 6th of March, addressed to Cameron, which pointed out the uncontrolled povwer he (Cameron) had over the funds of the bank, and required him not to overdraw his account without the consent of the directors. If Cameron's account was increased after that time he should say that it 'was increased fraudulently. On the 6th of March the balance to his debit was 2,6001. Did not believe it was 3,9881. in June. Saw the green ledger daily, and was sure It could not be so.
The ledger was here produced to witness, which showed the balance to be 3 9381. in June
The Witness.-Ke must have taken the moneys out and made the entries after the bank failed.
Mr. LU;x1Utyt.-You must be under great misapprehension there.
Reference was here made to Mr. Blacker having refused to take up shares after they had been allotted to him. Mr. Blacker was a very nervous man, and he did not consider him a good judge of banking affairs. (A laugh.) The money was returned to Blacker.
lMr. Stapleton here explained that the bank was considered te possess a valuable business, Cameron having told him that the goodwill of the bank was worth 50,0001. He remembered Mr. Deputy Daldn being introduced one fine morning by a director (byAlderman Kennedy). He was proposed as a director by r. Kennedy, and seconded by Ith (overnor. All he told mr. Dakin was that the bak had incurred some losses and considerable lock-ups but that it 'would recover. 31r. Dakin thereupon qualified as a director by paying 1,0001. for shares held by Mr. M'Leod. He (Mr. Stapleton) had been illtreated by being introduced into the bank. He had told Mr. Dakin of the hank having a prospect of losses from the Welsh mines, Humphrey Brown, and Camneron. Mr. Daldn attended a few days as a director, and had signed some of the minutes, but after having done he wrote the following

-He remembemed Mr. Gosiett addressing a letter threatening to call a rmecting unless his shares were purchased. He had declined to be a party to the purehase of those shares. There had been a discussion upon the subject with referenoe to the bank finding a purchaser. It was determined by them not to buy them. He knew, however, that Mr. Esdaile got his brother-in-law to purchase them. He denied most positively that he had himself sanctioned the purchase of those shares. Mr. Esdaile's memory had failed him if he, stated to the contrary; and if blame attached to any one for that transaction it 'was to Mr. Rsdallo only. eo remembered Mr. Gillott and others inviting an interview with the Court of Directors by letter in the month of MTay. There were present at a meeting which was thereupon granted Mr. Gillott, fr. Mitchell, and Mr.' Stewart,and another shareholder. He had nodoubt they referred to Mr. HumphreyBrown's account.

have alluded to. I objeted to the dividen audI roose to have acall, t in tothi ewasons; I hould theeto make one statement with reference to the manner in which these accunts have been made up. When I came intorthis hank I h every reason to believe not merely that it was a profitable concern, bute bank that any persn of honoar might eonnect himself with. By degrees i begau to find it was not so. I was desirous of getting mself disconnected ,with it, but I did not think that having been induced, how ever dishonestly by othera-by trick, to Decorie a truste for others,au t atsoudbeacting hononrcblyeif I fairlyosoldrmy shares theld my tonlue, as other peo had done before mre. Itherefore determined, at some ris ato 3yself, topendeavourif posible toget thetingsetright. Itwasutterly eipossibled or wse to do anything until I really kiew the state of affairs. I do not believe any man of business ould - certainly I could not through my own observation. The booksBwould not have told itrsue, because they would not toll thevalue of thesecurities. Itdepends uponmtheisolveneyof thepersonstowhomthe money was lent; andso the first thing I thought to be done was to get rid ot Mr. Cameron, in whom I had no confidence. The second thing waseto appoint a person in whom I had confidence. I therefore struggled, with no one to support me, until I got rid of Mr. Csmeron. Then I looked around for the best person to appoint. Oar choice h e s very limited; but there were many circumstances whiclh induced me to aPpoint Mr. crathaed. What I ha heard of him was favourd able to his charnter. He himself was in a pstio
to give a guarantee As to his respectability. I ltheren fore placcd it in his hands. If he had maid youL must not carry on this hank we shoulidnot; instead of that, he, takinog too sanguine a view, and he having had considerable experience, advised us to arry it on, And to pay a dividend of 6 per cent. I was opposed to it very much, but my ohjection was overruled. I thought that after this general meeting we shouladhave had new directors and had new upport, and the benefit of their commercial knowledge, and then we coald reconsider the expediency of carryng it on. Moreover, we had the prospect of merging in some other bank. By and by, as my eye became openel (a laugh), I found that we could not, and I was desirous of getting up this cal, so that we having751. id up, might be able to Inerge with another hank which Shaonly st. paid up, And in doing that I was incurring apersonal risk and gaoinc
nothing, buLt having most unceasing toil and anxiety. Again in cur negotiation with the London and Paris Bank.(for that may be mentioned now) we were so thoroughly convinced that we were solvent, quoad our depositor,that we oTered and d aged with them to refer the state of our affairs to Mr. Gilbart, but they insisted upon inspect. igoraccounts themselves. Mir. Gilbart is a well-kniown aentleman-the well-kaown mainagr of the London n
Westminster. We thought they were asking too much. The negotiation was inthatposition 'when the run on our hank caime, and the two banks came down together.
Mr. i2 r.ATEsi.-Whv- did you netted this to the shareholders at the general meeting on the lst of August?
Mr. Stapleton.-I never was authorized either by the Court of Directors or by any meeting of the company, and my conviction up to this moment is, that if this matter ever c-omes before a couart Of law it will be decided that I had no authority to do so, according to myreading of the 29th clause of the charter. And let mae say, if you were to adopt any other construction, All joint-stock banking would become
imosble Takeo any hank which has been recently estab1isheodss(witlh the oxcepjtion, perhaps, of the London and Westminster and the nion) and let them get hut one nervous or sily person into, their direction, and he has nothing to do but to adopt the construction you put upon this charter, and to get up and make a statement to the court as to his akpprehensions ; you wouldI thent have a ran on the bank and it would be rainod, and I believe that this 29th clause has been advisedlY introduced in order to prevent this. I have read this over a hundred time-s. My impression may he wrong, but that is mny view still, And I cannot understand it in anY other sense.
Mr. Ln,]xLATRxs-You do not mean to saY that if false and fraudulent accounts are placed before a proprietar Yyou. are to sit there and hold your tongue?t
Mr. Stapleton.-I did not say that. I had a course open to me which perhaps I might have adopted. I might have retired and sold my shares, and disconnected myself with it.l I did an injustice to mn.self. I Am the only sufferer by remnaining there, "an being able to contribuite towards the psynment of the debts, there is an unmitigated advantage both to the shareholders andl the proprietors. I saw no other course.
Examination continuied.-He did not dissent from the report as it was presented to the general meeting Hecdid not open his mouth at the general mneeting. He did not believe that the Assets of the bank bad been fairly valued on the 30th of June, 1856, At 1,124,0001. He could not give any idea as to what extent the figure were erroneous.He could not tell whenk he attended the general meeting of the Lst of August how much of the ~aid.up capital b %d been lost. Could not say whether they mightbhave lost one-third. Bad heard that Cameron offered to attend a general meet. in nthe ist of August. Hge made the observation that he (Cmeon), being no longer a shareholder or officer in the bn,had no busines there. Knew if he attended he wol not make A true statement. Did not know that Cameron was goinig first to Prussia, and then to the East.. Hie raid he was going to Egypt.
Xr. LLsNLATrmr-And so you let him go ? Mr. Stapleton.-Yes. (A laugh.)
Mjr. Lrscars,&Trpc-youx were glm to see him out of the hanik?
Mr. Stapleton.-We were glad to sce his back turnedglad to get himi out of the country. (Laughter.)
In further examination Mrr. stapleton stated the ciroinstances attendant upon the proposed formation of thLe London and Paris B ank. There was to be a loan of money to be placed to the credit of the London and Paris Bank.
Mrr. LmaruAvxTm-Was not- that loan by the Royal British Bank to be placed to the credfit of the account of the London and Paris Bank ia order-that they m-ight go ior their charter and say that the capital had been paid up!I
Mr. Stapleton utmtl admnitted that it was.
AiT,.l~ rmsqraru,exmnd sa be was th
accouLntant in the hank from February, 1853, to July, 1856, when he was appointed thegeneral manager. He prepared the balance-rbeet referred to -of June last. The auditors did not ak a single question respecting this balance-sheet. If they had he should have told them. If they had asked whetber many of the bills had been bad for yeas he should have referred them to Cameron. Many of the bills were badhe admitted. That was.the system of auditing introduced by Cameron and he followed it up. He should ba dispoed to ayJ now that the origialobjt of sch a system of auditing was to mislead. He introduced his balancesheet to the directors with his own hands.
Idr; L x'rx-Tell me, Ltr. Stcpleton, whether you sawV such an account ?
Mr. Stapleton.-I do not reoolleot ever having sen the account.
Mfr. Craufaud.-It is very posible you never did see them, but they were placed on. the board table for hours, and were accessible to any one.

CIVIL CoURT-(Before Mr. Justice CRONxDjR and a
Common Jury.) FORD V. REZCE.
Mr. Serejant Pigott and MIr. W. James appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Keating, Q.C., and Mr. Skinner for the defendant.
The plaintiff in the action, Edward B. Ford, sued, in firwmd pauperis, to recover frotn the defendant, Wiltiam Reece, an attorney at Ledbury, a sum of money amounting to one-third of 5,0001. From the plainitiff's evidence it appeared that, at the end of the year 1852, the defendant came to him and stated that he had reamon to believe that the plaintiffs brother, the Rev. John Ford, of New York, was entitled as heir-at-law to an estate in WYorcestershire called "the Holdfast" estate, valued at about 15,0001. It appeared the plaintiff had found in a secret dzawer of his grandf4ther's bureau the probate of his wiLt; and in the same bureau he bad also found a sampler worked by his great grandmother. These were iporltant discoveries, as tenin"gto establish the title ot the plaintiff's brother to the eL,, in question; and the defendant assured the plaintiff that if he would let him have them, to be produced on a trial, and if he would also furnish all the information in his power respecting his family, the defendant would be able to establish the Rtev. J. Ford's title to the estate. It was then agreed that in case the defendant succeeded he should have 5,0001., being one-third of the supposed value of the estate; and that the plaintiff, in return for the assistance to be rendered by him to the defendant, should have from the defendant one third of his 5,0001. An action of ejectment was therefore brought to recover the property for the Rev. J. Ford; and at the trial which took place at Worcester, in 1853, the plaintiff attended with the probate, his great grandmother's sampler, &c., and thus supplied the necessary liks in the chainof evidence which established the claimant's title. Having thus recovered the property, the claimant came over to Engand in September, 163, and met the defendant at Gl6cestr on the 7th of October. The Rev. J. Ford had at first intended to seLI the property and so to pay over the 5,0M1. which he had agreed to pay the defendant in cash; but, as he fotnd it impossible to sell the property at that time, it was agreed that he should mortgage the chief portioai of it to the defendant for the 5,0001. lrhis was accordingly done on the 7th of October, and at the same meeting the mortgage was transferred to Mr. Higgins, another attorney of Ledbury, for the sum of 6,0001. Of this sum 1,0001. was immediately paid over to the lRev. J. Ford, and it was admitted that at some time or another, but when it did not appear, a sum of 5,0001. was paid by Higgins to the defendant Rece in respect of the transfer of the mortgage. The arrangement thus made was in pursuance of an agreement between the Rev. J. Ford and the defendant, executed at the same time, but which contained an erasure as to the date ar,d the place of the Rev. J Ford's abode, the 27th of September being substituted for the 7th of October, as it originally stood, and Glocester being substituted for Ledbury. According to the evidence of a man named Tanner, the Rev. J, Ford refused to execute this agreement until the plaintiff's in terest was secured; and, upon that, an interlieation was made in the agreement for that pm-pose. The plaintLff's brother thea called upon the deendantthenand'theretopaythe plaintiffl.00. of his one-third of the defendant's 5,0001., to which the defendarntreplied that he was unable to do so at that time, but he gave him a cheek for 251. The plaintiffs brother then went away to America leaving the defendant in possession of a large portion of his estate, and diod there in the spring of 1854. The plaintiff subsequently applied to the defendant for his share of the 6,0001., but not succeeding in the demand, he at length brought the present action. The plaintiff's evidence was confizmed in several particulars by the man Tanner, who had been employed by the deceased in the management of part of the property.
Mr. Reece, the defendant, was called, and denied that he had entered into such an agreement as that spoken to by the plaintiff. He said he had agreed with the Rev. J. Ford to take 50001 for his services in recovering the property, and, thougnit vas the understanding between all theparthes that the plaintiff should have a sum equal to one-third of -what the defendant received, he said that was provided for by the-zgreement dated the 27th of Sepfemner, but executed on the 7th of October. By that agreement it appeared that the property was valued at 21,8401., and, according to the- defendant's evidence, it was arranged on the 7th of October that he should take 5,0001. only instead of onethird of 21,8401., subject to the payment of one-third to the plaintiff; it being arranged that the deceased should pay the plaintiff the sum to which he was entitled. The defendant was subected to a rigid cross-examination, from which it nppeare{ that during the past three years, since the death of the Rev. J. Ford, he bad been in poseession of a large portion of the property without paying any rent. He said he applied the rent he was to pay towards the liquidation of a bli .of 1,0001. which he had run up by his attemnp tato sell the property, for which he could not find a purchaser. It waa admitted that the late owner of the property had only received in all 2,2001., in respect to tho property valued at 21,8401.
Mr. Justice CuoWDER summed up the case with great care, and in so doing warned the iTry not to be led away by any notion that the plaintiff or his family had been hardly treated. However that might be, the question for the jury was whether the defendant had made the agreement rehed upon bz the plaintiff.
The jury, after taking some time to consider, found their verdcct for the defendant.
The trial of this cause, which concluded these assizes, was not brought to a close till past 10 o'clock last night.

AfIDDLB:SEX SESSIONS, Wednesday, April 8.
(Before the ASSISTANT-JUJDG.)
John Brovni was indicted for having unhawfull
attempted to obtain by false pretences the sum of 9s. 6d., with intent to defraud.
The prosecutor is the landlord of the Old Star and Crowvn publichouse, Broadway, Westminster, and it appeared that the prisoner went there, and called for sixpennyworth of gin, pUtting down what appeared to bo a halfsovereign, ut which really was an eleetro-plated sixpence. At the time ho asked for the gin he said he wanted change. It was at once detected that the coin was a sixpence, and the prisoner was givon in charge.
The ASSISTANT-JUDGE told the jury that if, upon the evidence, they thought the prisoner intended to pass off the coin as a halfsovereign and got the ohange, they must find him guilty.
The jury said that was their opinion, and they found the pri8Oner Guity.
The AssISTAs'r-JUDCE sentencedl him to three months' imprisonment.
James Redding was indioted for stealing a piece of silk, value ll., the property of George Wallis.
On Saturday night, the 21st of March, the prisoner and anotber man went into a dyer's shop kept by the prosecutor in Tachbrook-street, Pimlico, and, whie one of them asked some trivial questions about Ailk handkerchiefs, the other drewapieee of silk from the window. The prosecutor's vife observed this, and as she was getting round the counter they ran off. The prisoner was captured, but the other got
The jury found the prisoner Guilty, and
The COURT sentenced him to four months' hard labour.
William Parker, who was stated to be a publican out of business, was indicted for having assaulted John Whelan and imflicted actual bodily harm upon him. He surrenderea in court.
Mr. Horry prosecuted; Mr. Salter was forthe defendant. The transaction out of which this charge arose took plaoe at a publichouso called the Queen's Arms, in Dartmouth. itreet, on the 14th of March, at an early hour of tho morning. The prosecutor was an attorney's clerk, having some little means of his own, and it appeared that he and the prisoner had been acquainted with each other a considerable time, but, in eousequence of something which was not explained, the defendant, according to the case for tbqmxosecution, conceived feelings of deep animosity against bia -ormer friend and boon companion; but the canse he studiously kept a secret. They passed some time t the Queen's Arms on the night in question, and just before leaving tho prosecutor, who was tip.,s called for some gin. and-water in front of the bar, and the defendant asked him to treat him. The prosecutor stated in his evidence that on his refusing to comply with that request the defendant called him bad names, and on his going out into the street the defendant followed him and struck him a heavy blow over the left eye which felled him to the ground and caused him Intense suffering, which continued for 48 hours. His eye was aow bandaged up A woman named Tillett, who Was said to ho the prosecutor's housekee per, was a witness of the oocurrene, laving gone to the Queen's Arms to fetch him home, and ahe entirely corroborated his account of it.
The defence was that the prosecutor was a person of dissipated habits, and had on the night in question used very bad language, and refused to leave when the landlady wanted to shut up the house, when the defendant, who was a lodger, went to put him out, and he fell down and cut his eye. Witnesses were examined, who stated that the defendant did not strike the prosecutor.
The jury found the defendant Gui'ty generally.
It appeared from inquiries then made, that the defendant had been a person of some means, and had had 10 orl2 pubhichonses in London. He had recently obtained a verdict for 5004 in an action in the Court of Queen's Bench, and was in negotiation for another publichouse, l'he prose. cutor stated that he had refused to accept bills for him.
The AsSISTANT-JUDcE postponed the sentence, and the defendant was committed.

LAW REPOR1'T.
I ADMRALTY COURT. M EDNPESDAY. APRTT. A
TIIE LOFTUS.-COLT.TSTON
(Before Dr. LuSulNGTOX1.)
1 Ins was an action brought by the smack.Jamesaixd Anne againt the sloop Loftus, to recover the los arising from a colision between them at 3 a.m. on the Sbh of May last off Hastland Point on the morth coast of Devonshire. The smack was proceeding from St. Ives, Cornwall, to Swan, sea laden with fish and backs; the sloop from Bristol to Lon. don with a cargo of staves. The smntck, as she stated, dgscried the sloop distant a mile, whereupon she hauled close to the wind, and when she had approachedi sufficiently near hailed the sloop to keep away; but sbe paid no attention to it, and ran stem on into the smack. The sloop, in her defence, alleged that the atmosphere was dark, and she did not observe the smack until she was within the eighth of a mile. She immediately put her helm hard a-port and exhibited a light, but the smack, instead of porting her helm, as she was bound to do, put it a-starboard, and then suddenly ported it and threw herself in stays in the hawse of the sloop, thereby causing the damage of which she now complained.
Dr. Bayford and Dr. Deane wevre heard for the smack; Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss for the sloop.
The ELDER BRETHREN, by whom the Court was assisted were of opiDion that the Loftus did not port her helm in sufficient time, and therefore she was solely to blame.
The COURT pronounced accordingly.
TBE SYLPH.-COLaSION.
This was a suit promoted by the Datch galliot Ardina, of the burden of 107 tons, against the steamsshi SyIph, of the burden of 255 tons, with two engines, together of 70-horse power, to obtain compensation for a total loss occasioned by reason of a co ision between them at 4am. on the20th of November last, a few miles from Beachy Head. The gaDiot, with a valuable cargo of figs, wine, &c.;was hond from Lisbon to Vlaardingeu i the steamer was p'oceeding from London to Dublin with a general cargo and passengers.
According to the statement of the galiot, the morning was' moonlight, but cloudy, ! and she carried a light under the bowsprt cap. A green light was discovered between three and four points on the galliot's starboaTd bow, distant about a mile an a-half. The gaDiot, as a matter of precaution put her helm to starboard, for the purpose of givingthe steamer a wider berth. When the ga liot had luffed to about N.E. the green light disappeared, and the red light came into view, distant about h -a-mile. The galliot immediately ported her helm and paid off considerably, but the steamer ran stem on into her port midships, in consequence of which she instantly went down. The mate,the cook, and a boy were drowned, but the remainder of the crew escaped on board the steamer. The steamer alleged. that the galliot was seen distant half-a-mile, being the greatest distance at which she conld be seen, havirg no light visible on board her in the then state of the weather, about one point on the steamer's port bow. The helm was put bard-a-port, and the steamer came up in consequence, at the galliot, instead of keeping on her course or porting her helm, improperly starboarded it, and when too late to avoid the collision suddenly ported it, and thus brought the steamer in contact with her, notwithstanding her engines had been stopped and were ordered to be reversed.
Dr. Bayford and Dr. -Deane were heard forz the galliot; Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss for the steamer.
* The learned JUDGE, having conferred with the Elder Brethren, esaid, they were all of opinion that the case set up by thesteamer was manifestly untrue,because, if she hadput her helm to port when distant from the galliot half-a-mile, which she did according to her own statement, it was impossible that the collision could have taken place in the way represented by the steamer.
Decree in favour of the galliot.
Central Criminal Court, April 8.
CENTBAL CJIMINAIL COURT, Apr1 8.
OLD COURT.
(Before Mr. VNSIiCe ERLE and Mr. Jrstice WILLLMS.)
Henry Barnsdale, 21, pleaded " Guilty" to an indictment wvhich charged him with being feloniously at large before the expiration of a term of penal servitude to which he had been sentenced.
Mr. BODKIIN, who appeared for the prosecution, informed the Court that the prisoner was convicted of robbery in 1855, and sentenced to four years' penal servitude. He was sent to Woolwich, whero ho was employed in the hulks until the end of last year, when ho was removed by the order of the Secretary of State, with a number of other convicts, to Dartioor prison. The convicts were all secured together by a chain, and upon their arrival at Plymouth this chain broke, and the prisoner contrived to make his escape. He was taken into custody in London about a month back, and there did not appear to be any ground for supposing that he had been engaged in any dishonest courses during the time that he had been at large.
Mr. Justico ERLE inquired whether the chain appeared to have been broken by accident or by design.
Mr. BODnn. said it had not been ascertained whether the thaie broke accidentally or whether it arose by any act of f,he convicts.
Mr. Justice EBrI sentenced the prisoner to undergo four years' ponal servitude from the present time. g
Rlobert Goodacro, 19, a well-drcessed young man, pleaded Guilty" to two indictments for forgery.
Mr. BoDTxY, who conducted the prosecution on behalf of the Bankers Association, said that the prisoner had been employed as clerk to a gentleman natned Abraham, who kept an acount at Messrs. Druninond's, and he was of course aware of that fact, and was well acqguainted with his master's signaturz. It apueared that, taking advantage of this knowledge, the prisoier had forged U checks in Mr. Abrabam's name dunng the last year, and had obtained by this means a sum of 2001. The proceeds of the last forgery were found in his possessi6n when he was taken into custody.
Mr. CAMIPBLL SLEIGH, who appeared for the prisoner said that he had pleaded guilty of his own accord, and he was instructod to urge upon the Court in mitigation of the offence he had committed his youth, and also that there, was good ground for believing that he had been led into his present disgraceful position through betting upon horse raees, and the faoities that were unbappily offered to young men at the present time to mix themselves up with such transactions.
Mr. Abraham, the master of the prisoner, said thiere was no doubt hc ;had been in the habit of frequentm g a rting houses, as they were termed, and that this had led hm to commit the crime to which he had pleaded guilty. He believed, however, there were other persons who were more guilty than he in the transaction, and he was of opinion that if the sentence was postponed the prisoner would probably give some information that might further the ends of justice.
Mr. Justice EiLEn said, it was dear from recent disclosures that had taken place that the system of forery upon bankers was carried on as a regular trade, and he thought it very important that everything should be done to obtain information upon the subject, and if there was any chance of the prisoner giving such information he would certainly postpone passing sentence.
Thomas Nichols, 19, a Post-office letter carrier, was indicted for stealing a letter, containing two sixponces and a threepenny-pioco, the property of the PostmasterGeneraL
Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Clark prosecuted; the prisoner was defended by Mr. Mfetoalfe.
It appeared that the prisoner Was employed at the General Post-oftce in St. Martin's-le-Granid on the morning of the 12th of March in sorting letters, and in consequenco of something that had previously occurred his prioceedings were watched by a gentleman named Clare ad Bingham, the officer of the establishment. He was observed by them to handle one letter, and after he had done so he placed It before him, and in sorting the other letters he was seen to keep this partioular one on the top, and he then unbuttoned his waistcoat and looked round as though to see whether he was observed by any one, and he then thrust the letter in question into his trousers. He was immediately sent for into a private office and told that he had been seen to secrete a letter, but he denied hav don so. He was then told to undress himself, and he tok off his trousers, and it was observed that while so engaged ho kept fumbling with his shirt, and he was told to drop his hands, and when he did so the letter in question fell from his person, and the prisoner then said it must have got where it was found by acoident.
Mr. M=rcArx now made the same defence on behalf of the prisoner, and endeavoured to show that in the hurry of sorting the letters the one in question might have acoidentally fallen among his clothes,
The jury returned a verdict of Guilly, and the prisoner w.as sentenced to four years' penal servitude.
Charles Jackson pleaded "Guilty" to a charge of the same kind,
It appeared that the prisoner was employed at the Post. office, and part of his duty was to examine the mail bags after they were emptied of their contents and prepare them for re-transmission to the country. It seemed that upon one occasiorl a bag which contained a number of registered letters, in which there were banknotes and other securities to the amount of 5701. was left bv accident in the larger bag, and the prisoner took possession of the contents of this bag, and was proved to have changed five 51.-notes at the Bank of Bngland, these notes being a portion of the amount contained in the registered letters. He was asked to account for the possession of these notes, and he said he was unable to give any explanation, and he subseqcuently stated -where ho had deposited the remainder of the notes, and the whole amount was recovered with the exception of the five 51,-notes that had been changed by the prisoner.
He was sentenced to four years' penal servitude.
James Wright, another post letter carrier, was charged With misdemeanour.
Mr. Laxton appeared for the defence.
The defendant was employed as a letter-carrier at Streatham, and it appeared that in consequence of compl1aints that were made of the non-delivery of letters in that distct the authorities of the Post-office took the usualproceeding of sending what is called a test letter, with a view to discover the guilty party. This letter was not delivered, and upon the prisoner being questioned he admitted he had not delivered it, and he showed the officer where a number of other post letters had been hidden by him in a field at Streatham, and several other letters vtwre found in the celar of his house. None of these letters appeared to have been opened, and under these circumstances the defendant was charged with mosdemneanour, in having unlawfully delayed to deliver and secreted lettera-that were intrusted to him for that purpose in his capacity of letter-carrier. The only excuse given by the prisoner for his conduct was that he was too tired to deliver all the letters that came to him in the performance o;f hig duty, and thait he placed the letters where they were. found, intexdingto deliver them on the following morning.
The learned counsel for the defendant addres'sed the jury at om legt, ad ndeveredtoshow that he had rtotwilfullys ecretedthese letter switi hany dishonest intention, and said that if he had really entertained ta lntention, he would havel destroyed the lettes' nie
ahnd not have acted in the manner he did vi.hreJm.rtel
Mr. Justico WILLIAMS in Lis summing up said, that under the present indictment dishonesty was iot in. puted to the defendant, hut thc offence with which l
was charged consisted in his not having deliiered in due course the letters tha.t lied been intrusted. to him for that purpose; and if thd jury should he of opinion
that he had done this, no matter what was his object,
..1w-oauld be liablo - to bhe convicted_gpon, thepre ept=
charge. It was not necesasiy for him to remind the jury that thlere wero cases in: which the whole prospects of a man's life might bo destroyed by the non-delivery of a letter, and that the greatest misery might also be occasioned by a similar cauee in cases of illness, and theobject of tho section in the Act of Parliamentunder tvhich the present indictment was framned was to punish
,very person who should be suilty of delaying the delvery ,of a post letter intrusted to b;m in the course of his duty, -under any eircumstances. The only' question, therefore, Ifortlie consideration of the jury was whether it waS mdie outto their satisfactioui that the prisoner had improperly neglected to deliver the letters that had been intrusted tohi3 chbarge.
I The jury, without aniy hesitation, returned a verdict of GwUity.
Mr. Justice WuL.IUS, in passing sentence, said that the prisoner had been convicted of a very-mischievous and I'dangerous offence, andoone that might be attended with ve:y r erious consequences. He therefore felt it to he his duty to IpasS a sever sentence, in order to deter others in a similar Ipoastion from committing thelike offence. He then ordered
,the defendant to be imprisoned and kept to hard labour for -
lSarah Price, 27, a miserable-looking creature, was inaicted for the wilful murder of her child, Robert Crawley Price.
Mr. Payne prosecuted; the prisoner was defended by Mr,
*5 e learned counsel for the prosecution,. in opening the case, saidthe was fearful that the evidence would not leave )any doubt on the mind of the jury that the unhappy child ,whose death was the subject of Inquiry had lost its jife by the act of the erisoner, and he believed the on7y defence that would be attempted in- her behalf 'was that ahe was not in a state of mind to be responsible for 4theAct'she had committed. He then gave a brief narrative of ,the facts, and stated'that the body of the deceased childw as found i the canal in the Regent's Park on the morning of the-l7th of March, and the prisoner, upon being questioned, at once admitted that she had thrown It into the water on the evening before. He said he believed that this was the fist occasion where the insanity of the prisoner was sug-gested, but, of course, if the fact should be made out to tho satisfaction of the jury, they wouldbe justified in' acquitting her upon that ground.
The following evidence was then adduced:-
B3enjamin Morris deposed that he knew tho prisoner, and was aware that she had a child seven months old, and he said that he afterwards saw the dead body of that child at the workhouse.
By Mr. SLm -The prisoner had- been in tho workhouse with her child up to Monday, the 16th of March. She came to his house on the Tuesday morning, and said that she had left the workhouse, and was destitute. At this time she appeared to be like a woman out of her mind. She tore off a portion of her clothes and burnt it, and in conseuence of her proceedings he was induced to send for Mr. -wildbore, a surgeon, and he came to see her, and took two knives out of the cupboard and told witness to watch bei. The witness added that he had been that day to ask
ir. Wildbore to attend and give tvidence, but he refuaed ,to do so unless he was'6ubpcenaed and 'paid his fees. The pisoner always aJpeAred very fond of her child. The lather had deserted her entirely, and had left the prisoner in a destitute condition.
By Mr. PAvE.-The prisoner had no home or place to
to when she came to hishouse. Her mind appeared to he wandering, and she did not sem to know what she was doing at that time. She said that her blood was all turned to cold wAter, and she had no blood in her, and witneWsss wife 'made her some tea. She remained at his house all the Tuesday, hut she hardly spoke a word, and the next day she went to aee her father. -He did not say anything relatin
to the state of the prisoner's mind when he was examined by the ma istrate. He asked the pri6oner what had become o the c 'd. and she said that she had strangled it, and
thrown t over tho bridge into.the river.
I By Mr. SnuGom-The prisoner was in a most excited state all the week, and one day be foruda rope with a noose in it in his house.-
Mr. Richard Thomas Tubbs, assistant overseer of St. MIarylebone pariah, said that on the 20th of March, after the inquest had been held npon the child, he saw the pri. soner in the St. Pancras Workhouse.- She was in the insane ward, partl undressed. He asked her her nau.e, and she said twice urawley, bit afterwards she' said her hame was Dot Craflley, but Price. Sho had- been living with a man named Crawley, who had died three years before. He then imquired how many children slbe had, ana she said she had a boy seven years old, and stated that she had a aby, but that she made sway with it, and throw it'into the water. She then asked him if he knew where it was then, and he told her it was in Marylebone-Workhouse, and she wanted to know when it was brought there. He told her it was taken there on Tuesday morning, and she said she had thrown it over the bridge on Monday night, about halfpast 8 o'clock - and she said she intended to have de: stroyed herself at the samt time, but a policeman called out. to her, and the was frigtened, and
away. She had half a shawl on, and the pnsoner said she hadwrappedthe other half round her cid,andabe said that her blood was all turned to cold water, and that she felt it all cold round her loins at that moment. The prisoner- also said that the child was suffering from disease of tke kidnevs, as she thoulit, and that it was a great sufferer, and that she herself liad suffered greatly. As she was going to the pollce station the prisoner repeatedly sad that she wished she was with her baby.
By Mr. SsZorG.-The prisoner was placed in the insane ward by diroction of 3Ir. Wildbore. As she was being conveyedto the police station she said she intended to destroy herself, and she was only sorry she had not done so at the titne. In consequence of her demeanonr he directed that she should be watched, and told the inspector to take care
;r. Mackrell, an inspector of police, proved that the pri. soner also told him that she should have thrown herself into the water with her child if the policemanhad not come up.
Evidence was then given that on thebmorning of the 17th of March the dead body of the child was found in the canal in the Regent's Park. A piece of towel was tied tightly round the neck.
Mr. W. B. Mushet, the surgeon who examined the body of the deceased child, stated that if the ligature had been tied round the neck of the child before it was thrown into the water it might have presented the appearancen that were exhibited when he saw it. The causes of death were not, however, well marked, and there was no obvious cause. The only diseased symptom he observed was a collapsed state of the lungs, and appearances as though the child had had diarrhoea. There were some indications that the cause of death was suffocation, but they were not at all well marked. It was consistent with all he saw that the came of death was suffocation or strangalation, but he said he was unable to give a Vositive opinion upon the point. He was, however, of opinion that the death of the child was not the result of drowning, and he added that he was of o0 nion that the ligature round the neck was the causo of tMe death, but he would not take upon himself to state so positively.
In answer to a question ut by Mr. Justice ERLi,
The witness said that the eame appearance of the lungs he observed in this case was sometimes exhibited in the case of children who died from exhaustion produced by any cause.
By Mr. PAs.-In his opinion the ligature was the cause of death, supposing it had been tied round the neck wbile the child was alive,
In answer to a question put by Mr. SLEIGH,
The witness said it was impossible to state positively, from the marks on a dead body, whether such a ligature was tied immediately before or immediately after death.
i Mr. SnE nmade a most earnest appeal to the jury on bcehalf of the prisoner, and he urged that there was not sufficient proof that she was the actual cause of the death of the child, and he also said that if the jury should be of opinion that she was there could be no doubt that at the time the act was committed she was not in a state of mind to be cri minally responsible for her conduct.
- sr. Gibson, the surgeon of the gaol of Newgate, was called as a witness for the prisoner, and he stated that she had been under his care smnee the 22d of March, and he had paid particular attention to her, with a view to ascertain the state of her mind, and he was of opinion that she was decidedly. uot of sound mind; he was also of opinion, from what he saw of her and from what he had heari of her conduct previously, that at the time this act was committed ahe was not in a condition of mnind to distnguish between right andwrong, or to know that she was committing a crime in destroying the child.
By Mr. PA.YNz -Her conduct sinee she had been in cus. *-tody indicated the greatest wretchedness and despair. She ,entartained several delusions, one of which was that she had lime running up her back, which destroyed her spine and, as she said, "fumed" out of her mouth. She also expressed an opinion that her nilk had turned to water, and her ideas appeared entirely confused. Amone other things, she told him that the hild had a great hore in its back that she :could put her fist in. He was qnite sure the prisoner's conduat was not in any y simulated, Her apearance was most strikng, and any one passing through theard where she was connined with many others would at once have picked her out as a person mentally affected.
T^he learned Junon then briefly summed up the whole of the evidence, and
The jury at once returned a verdict of Not Guily on the ground of insanity.
She was ordered to be detained during Her Majesty's plea. sure.
Alexander Clark, 35, was indicted for the manslaughter of Eliza Bunn.
lr. Phillips conducted the prosecution.
It appeare thattheprisoner was a photogranhic artist and carried on that profession in the Commere' -road, and that on the 25th of February the deceased accompanied a woman named Howe to his shop to make some mquiries about a portrait the prisoner had taken of her son. The prisoner declined to give up the portrait, on the ground that it was not a good one, but he retained the money paid for it, andthis led to a qnarrel and scuffe between al the parties, during which the prisoner was thrown down, and ell into a pan of water, and after this it appeared that he picked up a hammer and struck the deceased on the head with it, and itwas alleged- that the injury sbe so received was the cause of her death. At first it was supposedthattho blow wsz not of a serious character, and the prisoner was convicted by a magistrate of an assault, and fined 20sf. The deceased very soon afterwards, however, became much worse, and she was taken to the hospital, where she died three days afrards, and it was then discovered that hertull was fractured, and the injurywas of a decrip. tion that might have been cLcasoned by such an instrument ,as hammer. It came out in the couse of ae that - one of the women had seized the prisoner bythe neckerchief
and the other by the hair, and the seemed to be struggling to get possession of the hammer. It alo an E peared that the woman who accompanied the deceased id that if the portrait was not given to her she would umasl
everything in the room, and also all the specimens that were outside, and the deceased smancked his face and said
"Take that; now will ou give us the portraibiti and the prisoner attempted *to put them out of the room, and this led to the affray. The prisoner, it appeared, was also par- ialyparalyzed.
The prisoner, in his defence, declared that what he did wasin el ~dfene nd o potct imslffrom the Tiilenco

A respectable.looking man, named Jackson, was indicted for feloniously receiving a firkin of butter, the property of George William Glami5ter.
Hr. Campbell Sleigh and 3Mr. Thompson prosecuted; and Mr. W. Cooper defended.
It appeared that the prosecutor is a grocer and cheesemonger at Stepney, and prisoner keeps an oil shop in Leonard-street, Shoreditch. 'Upon the evening of the 16th of February a man who was passing the shop of the prosecutor saw four men take the firkin from the door, and, placintg it ona barrow, wheel it to the prisoner's shop, where they took it in, and upon coming out one of them said in the hearing of the man who had been following them that Jackson was a bad fence, as ho had only given them 11 s., and they should not go to him again. This witness communicated what he had seen to the prooecutor, who went early the next morning with Sergeant Copp into pisoner's shop, and upon questioning him about the-hutterie sidhe had not seen any, but while they were there the prisoner'g servant was seen to leave by auother door and go to a milkeshop few doors off. She was followed by the constable who foumd that she had taken the prosecutor's flrkir of butter there. Prisoner then said that he had not bought the batter, but had lent some money on it.

The Court refusing to discharge the.prisoner, his attorneys, Messrs. Lewis, removed the case by yrtioran to this Court.

The jury, having been absent some time, Acquitted the prisoner.
Wlliam TAne, 24, clerk, pleaded "Guilty" to havin

She had st brought uF under the superintendence of the Bishop of Ripon, and was the mistress of the St. Giles-in. the-Pields nstional schools, and she had been intrusted to take sonie of the children to Bamsgate, and upon her Passage met the prisoner, who came and, looking over her shoulder at a book e wasreading, said, "`sX , Ipercelre your tastes and mine agree. Thank God, I am religious.)' From thi the intiacy began, and he saw her parents, ad by fraud gave her to understand that his friends a pproved thenmatch. Everything was carried on apparently honourably, and in Septemoer last year thoy were married at St. Gles-in-the-Fiels. They had not long been married when prisoner was tried and convicted of Eome act of dishonety, and whiloe in prison he wrote most penitent religious letters to his seoond wife, praying her to exert heaself to obtain a commatation of his sentence.

(Before ae Cowomo SZrJEAm.)
Lewis Evans, 73, mariner, an infirm old man, was indicted for unlawfully by falsepretences obtaining from the East India Company two orders for the payment of Si.
Mr. Serjeant B ntine and Mr. Giffard prosecuted.
It appeared from the evidence, which was partly documentary, that as far back as 1834 the prisoner aplied to the East India Company for the pension which tye Company allowed to the officers and petty officers, as low as carpenters, uapon the Company relinquishing a portion of their maritime trade. The stipulations upon which such pensions were awarded was actual employment for 10 years and upwards for the Company, and then the applicant must not at the time have given up that service for any other. The prisoner made apjplication as Edward Lewis Evans, stating different periods of service for the Comoan
as boatswain and gunner on board the General rri's and other vessels, rendering himself eligible for the

Mr. Mullenq, solicitor to the Committee of Banklers for the Prevention of Forgeries and Frauds, attended on the part of the prosecution.
Spittle said,-I produce a warrant granted at this court on the 20th of January lat against the prisoner for forging an endorsement to a bill of exchange. I received the prisoner yesterday from the police authorities at Boulogne.
The prisoner was rema;ded for the purpose of enabling the prosecutors to produce the forged instrument and the necessary evidence against him.
George Norris, who till within the last week had been for about 12 years in the service of Messrs. hoses and Son, tailors, in the Minories, was brought up upon remand, charged with having robbed his employers of about 7 owt. of goods of various descriptions.
It will be recollected that the evidence given at the last examination was to the effect that an asdstant to a sheriff's officer, upon proceeding to the residence of the prisoner at Straword for the purpose of levying execution upon his goods, found an immense quantity of cloth, silk, calico coats, waistcoats, &c. some of -which bore the mark of the prose. cutors. The idea at once struck him that these articles had been stolen, and he mentioned his suspicions to a metropo li',an police constable, who forthwith communicated wiith the prosecutors. The pri3oner ws then given into custody.
Mr. Darbold, an assistat to the prosecutorm, said,-The prisoner had abox for the use of himself at the wvareEhouse of the firm. On the 3lstuit. it wvas broken open in mz presence, and in it was the cost produced, which the pnsoner was in the habit of wearing. The coat contains a breast pocket extending as far as the tail of thc cost, and it has two other pockets extending allthe wayround from the front to the backof the skirts.

The whole of this property Ibelieve to belong to the prosecutors. The prisoner had no right to remove any property from the premises of the finm.
H. J. Beckwith.-On the 29th ult. I went to the residence of the prisoner, near Angel-lane, Stratford, for the upose of levying an execution upon his goods. I asked e prisoner how he became posessed of the articles alluded to by the last witness, when he replied that he could not account for their being there. Believing them to have been stolen, I communicated -with the constable Sturgeon, who afterwards coramunicated with the prosecutors,
Sturgeon, after enumerating the various articles found at the re_dence of the prisoner, said that upon taking him into cuitody thelatter obeerved, " Suppose laim able to prove thatI bought alhthee things, how wil it be then P

W s s- olm ClLaghan, Thomas Conway, and Patrick Fracoley, threolabourers, vere charged with having endeavouted by threats and intimidation to force a number of men to dept from their work.
daward Bke, foreman to Mfr. realke, builder, who iis employinga great nunber.oF men in building and finishing
houses at -rnogatte and Exhibition-road, stawed that the labourers " tumed ouV' on Tuesday afternoon. They had been receiving S. per day for some time past, and wanted an increase of 4d., which was refused them. Theyaccord. ingly received their wages and left. Some came in again, and the necessary number of new men were procured, and put on to the works yesterday morning, but they had nardly commenced their labour vwhen they *ere disturbed and menaced Jy the men who remained out. The three defendants were the most prominent of the party. 'When the hawk-boys found that the labourers had struck some of them did the same, and endoavoured to force their way into the btildings to attack the oth'ors who remained, and a man was turning one of the former but, when the de. fendant Fracoley threatened to break his BlCUl in for doing so, and all the defendants threatoned the labourers at work that if they did not leave they would do for them when they came out. The three defendants were among the men who iad- "1 turnd out.
After further evidenoe had been given in support of the
Callaghan, in re said he came a long distance for 3a, per day; Conway thai: he wras merely waiting for his shovol, w;hich he had left in the building; aind Frseoley endea. voured to excuse hfimself for the threat spoken of by statini that the boy alluded to war the mauraupport of a widowed
Mr. PAYhm"r said that tho offence which the defendants Lad Omrmitted was a very serious one; aud he therefore sentenced Callaghan to three rmenthsthard lib6ur in tho
House of Correction, and the other two defehidants to 14 days each;- and he begged it to be distinctly understood that, if tniero wa after this any further interference with the men on the buildings, he should impose the full penalty on any other offender brought-beforehun,

hacklewethe former all people in thb-lower clas of life, wL charged, the fist-amed six witl asulfti and resisting the qlice in the execution of their daty,and Mr Coen 'withinciting the others so to misconduct them-
The case wa very long and complicated, but substantially May be sted in this way:-0alton, a constble of the R divsion, was on duty in Church-street, Kingsland-road, at 4 in the afternoon of the 30th ult, when a gentleman lnasted upon his taking Into custody a man who had brutally assaulted a woman. Halton captured the man, when Waggett came up, and exclaimint 'I'll- see ou - before you shallteke him," grasped him by the stock, thrust li knuckles Into his throat, struc} hiL epeatedly and violenty with his disengaged fist in the stomach, face, eyes, nnd-other s of his person, and otherw se conducted bimgelf ia such anoutrageous er that Hlton wa obliged to relinqmiah his hold of his prisoner, Who escaped, much to the regret of the gentleman who gae him in charge, and 'who himself was bleeding from the chin alton and other officers thten went in search of the escaped man,- whom they coula not find, but Met Waggett in a place caled Peattree-
court, and took him for hig previous asilt. Waggett rosisted most violently, and got the offlcer down on the pavement, and the conduct of a mob which collected was so scandalous that the gentleman who gave the first man into custody, and 'who gave his residence as in Great Ormonde-street, drove to the station in a cab to warn the acting-inspector, TownAhend, that one of his men was being nearyklled. A number of other constables were therefore espatched to the court, on reaching which they foundcamobof about 150 people collected, armed with pantiles, bricks, and other danggerous missiles, which they hurledlat the officers to prevent them capturing Waggett, who had thrown himself down on his back, and fought and kickedoutrageously at all the constables 'ho came near him, but who, though described by one of the officers as almost dead from the Mob tugging at him to got him away from the police, had yet sufficent strength left to injure one of the constables by two heavy kicl:. in the side and groin The peaoeable neighbours caUed on the police to use their truncheons, and they did Eo as well as they oould, the 'woman Ballard, who was most active in trying to rescue W ggett, reoeiving one blow on the arm, for which she retaliated with two or three well-planted others with her fist in theo constable's neck. Cohen called out, " You vagabonds, why don't you let the man go quietly 7" and they immediately rdeased Waggett, but instead of being peaceable he became more outrageous than before, struck one officer several times in the face an th lice were obliged to curb him again by sheer strength an for but it took the united exertions of severl constables to secure him, and about 20 to clear the mob and tak all the others. All the prisoners were more or less cencerned in both rescues, but the prisoDers individually distinguished themselves in tn-that Lepine flung a pail of water overtone offlcer, striking another on the head as he did Po, struck a third on the- eye, and seized a fourth by the collar; Dane hurled a large stone at the police; Morganand Wright exerted themsel-esgtorescae Waggett; and Cohen, whoseconnexion with te afi4ir was not very clearly explained, continually incited the mob to their violence by caling them butchers, Eigs, vagabonds, villains, rogues, and other oppronous epi.heta, called out "Rescue, rescue," numerous times, seized one constable by the coUar, and in fact "he appeared to me" said one witness, "either like a madman or drunk," thongh it seemed he was perfectly sober. One officer said he was burt in the chest, stomnach, and eye; a second, that he had been so beaten and kdcked that he had been uselesa since; a third, that he was very much injured indeed; a fourth, that be was struck vio.ently by a large stone; a fifth, that he was ill and could scarcely walk; and Mr. Townshend stated that three of the police had been so seriously hurt that they were then wholly unfit for duty, one of the officers also attributing the trouble to which they hai been subjected nearly entirely to the conduct of Cohen.
Lopine declared that he was not there; Waggett that he -gaswruk ad was very sorry; and the others (writh the exception of Dane, who was discharged) reserved their defence, by tho advioe of Mr. Cohen, 'who expreseed his intention to do so himself in the event of the magistrate sending the case for tral, and, if not, that he would lay the whole matter before the Police Comminsionem.
Mr. D'Eyxco,,nT, however, told him that he should certanly do so, as these riots must be put a stop to, and there
ras quite suffieent evdene m for a jury.
The depodiffons were therefore taken, and the prisoners orded to be committed for trial, but 'with liberty to put in bail, Cohen twro sureties in 401. each and himn elf in 801.
Wsggett twro sureties in 204 each and himself in 401, and the others in 101. bail and 201. recognizancee respectively.

Mr. NORTON.-Therc ean be no doubt whatever of your taking this cloak, and I might send you for trial on the charge, but I shall take the milder course, on account of your age and order you to pay 51. out of this hoarded wealth of yours, and in default of payment you will be sent to prison for a month.

Mr. NORTON.-I see what your object is; it is to save the money and live at the expense of the county, bit the law gives me the power to order payment ot the penalty out of the money found in your possession, and I shall do so.

Poisoning By Photography.
POISONIZVG BY PHOTOGRAPHY.
TO TH EDITOR OF THE TMES.
Sir,-I trust you wlrl not consider it an intrasion if. through your means, I seek to warn photographers in general of the gat risk they ran in the use of a cer. salt, the cyanide of potassium, in their operations.
My attention was called to the subject by obeerving in some of the papers an account, taken from a Cape jonnial, of a Dr. Atherstone, who was dreadfully mijured-im fact, all but kled-by the effects of this deadly poison, which came in contact with the blood through some slight scratches on his fingers. The effect was Instantaneous, and, as every one who has read the account knows, the most alarming symptoms followed. Now, this might easily happen to any one else. A mon uSiDng this solution forgets some little scratch on his finger, and by accident adrop fall4 on the place; in a moment the poison flies through his veins, aud the work of detruction is accomplished before thu unfortunate rsfferer has time to think of or obtain, an antidote.
There are two things I would especially draw atten. tion to :-I. That the use of this salt is, m my opinion, unpardonable, because there is a perfect substitute for it-viz., the hyposulphite of soda, which has besides n advantage. The cyanide, in fixing the photograph, will, if not poured off at the right moment, dissolve away the picture itself; this can never happen with the hyposulphite. There is but one idle excuse that can be pleadedc for the cyanide-viz., that it requires rather lens care and. trouble in washing it off after fixing than the soda solution. And as to taking off stains of nitrate of silver, this can be done without incurring the terrible risk of Wah an accident. as happened to Dr. Atherstone, by moistening the spot fuat, with a strong solution of iodide of potassium, then with dilute nitrio add, andwashing afterwaids with hypo6ulphite. of soda.
LAst, but not least, I would call attention to the great want of caution inuplacing this salt in the hands of persons unacquainted with its dangerous properties. Sets of photo. graphic apparatus, with chymicals, book of inetructions, &c>, complete, are now very generally sold at prioes of three, five, and ten guineas and upwards. I bought one of these myself and found it answer very wrell; but now comes the point which I would entreat persons who are amusing themselves in this art, or whose friends or children are doing Eo, to observe,-Among the chymicals is a bottle labelled (as I know for a fact) only " lixing solu. tion." Now, who is tolknow whetherit is the cyanide or the hyposulphite? In my case it was the cyanide, and it is so most generally. In the book of-mstructions the proportions for making this solution are given, but without the slightest mention of its poisonous qualities, and without even mentioning the hyposulphite as a substitute. There is also a book publishea by one of the first photographic establishments in London, in which this slt is presnrbed in tweo operations,-first in cleaning the plate, and then, as before, n the t ng Process; butin bothcases without anyeaution as o its use. It is absolutely annecessry in the cleaning as anmmonia will do equally well. I will just mention wiiat happened to myself, and which proves the danger there is. In that very operation-viz., cleaning the plate-I cut my finger-I suppose with the edge of the glass, but did not
rceiveIt 1t AIsw are of blood on the cloth. Now, Sir, oula just ak thegentemen who publish that book what would have happnea had I been foUowing their directions as to cleanlng plates ?
If whatI have said may be the means of cautioning persons from uiDng (asis very generally done by amateurs, especially ladies) solutions without knowing what they are, I trust you wil not think your vauable space wasted.

The Trlt iron ste4m troopship, Cormnander Chambers, | *hich left Spither. for China about 2 p.m. on Tuesday 'with about 600 troops, put bac to Portsmouth harbour Yesterday in distress. It appears she brought up oaring to thick weather near the Needles, and anchored for the night, lnd it is supposed that while at anchor ze swung on her anchor mnd knocked a hole in her bottom, which let in water so fast that the pumps could a4t free her from it. the got back to Spithead in safety and went into harbour. She will be Inmeditely docked and tke troops and baggage landed meanwhile. A court of inquiry will be held to-day to aseertain accuately the Cbuse ofthe disaster.

One of the Australian line of Emigrant vessels, the Admiral, new lying at Deptford, is ordered down to WooL -wich to-day to ship Ordnance stores, and also to embark Captain A. J. lothrke, Lieutenant 13. D. Malcolm, Lieutenant G. D). Prichard, and the 23d Company of the Royal Engineers for China. The Admiral has been especially iselected for this purpose by reason of her spacions accommo. dation and healthily arranged decks (7.J feet in height), essentidlly requisite in the present emergency, when the transports wi be retainaed in the service as local quarters for the troops en arrival at their destination, On account of the lofty buiUl of the middle deck, it haa been found necees sary to erect a range of extra beams, in order to sling the hammocks in an available position.
The steamship Lebanon arrived at Woolwich yesterday naorning to esabark four companies of artillery and a provision of war stores for Canada and Halifax. In consequence ef the pacisty of hands reserved in the Military Store Department of Woolwich Arsenal, according to the limited arrangements provided by the estimates granted for the ensuing year, the work of shipping stores is naturally pro. gressing slowly, notwithstanding the most active exertions even beyond office hours. The Violet freightship, having sipped a portioa only of her heavy cargo for China, about E00 tons, was yesterday morning hauled off the pier to give place to the more urgent necessity of lading the Lebanon and the despatch of the Engineers.
Captain Leopold Grimston Paget, with the offlcers and gunners composing the R field battery of instruction, recesitly formed at Aldershott, arrived last night at head quarters, Woolwich, and joined their battalion to be prepared for foreign service. The horses were disposed of among the troops and batteries serving under Colonel Warde at Aldershott.
Yesterday morning a party of 20 junior officers of the Boyai Aztillery assembled in the mortar-ground at Woolwich, and performed a two hours' course of 8, 10, and 13inch mortar practice, firing over a range of 600 yards. The point to which the fire was directed was a flagstaff planted on the frequented part of the common. To obviate the possibility of accidents from the near approach of the spectators, a range party of gunners was in attendance. Immediately proceding each disobarge of the heavy ordnance the precautionary signal was given by a party of drummers on duty for that purpose on the spot.
The Eastings, 60, screw blockship, was commissioned yesterday at Portsmouth by Captain E. B. Mends, late of the Royal Albert, for Coastgnard service, with a complemaent of 350 mea.
The Assistance, iron steam-troopship, got up her steam yesterday in the steam-basia at Portsmouth, to try her engines, before being reported ready for commission.

Some important experiments with signal lights for ships in distress were exhibited at Portsmouth on Monday and Tuesday nights, by order of the Lords of the Admiralty. They are patent detonating and luminous signals, the invention of Messrs. Langford rnd Wilder, of Birmingham. They differ from those in use in the fleet in the brilliancy of their light and the expense of manufacture. The composition in the patent is enclosed in metal tubes, whereas tha common light is enclosed in paper tubes. On Monday night the steam gunboat Stork, tender to the Excellent, .went to Spithead about 9 o'clock to test the neow invention, nnder the superitendence of Captain the Hon. F. T. Pelham, C.B., of the Blenheim; Captain G. H. Seymour, C.B., of the Victory; Commander Mackenzie, and First Lieutenant Lethbridge, of the Excellent; and Mr. Richard Nichols, of Birmingham, on behalf of the patentees. The light showed Itself so briliant and diffused at the distance of five or EiX rniles from the point of observation that it presented the illusion of a ship on fire. Another trial took place on the glacis of Southsea Castle on Tuesday night, when the great light burnt equally effectively, but the metal tubing drops as the flame burns, and being in a molten stale, presents a "difficulty," as it is liable to bun the deck of a ship or be blown into the inflammable rigging, and thus cause as much distress as it is intended to obtain succour, This, however, the experimenitalists state can be prevented. Singular evidence of the uselessness of the common signal light-the blue-light served out to the Preventive Service men for night alarms-was ox hibited on the latter occasion. Captain Pelham bade the Coast-guardsman on duty at the Southsea Castle Station strike his light, to show the difference between its power and those under exhibition, when the man made several attempts to comply with the order -without success. The light would not display itself, the percussion wfa3 damaged, or the composition damp, or some such cause rendered the alarm beacon totally worthless. Further esperiments with tho patent lights to burn re spectively 2A. 5, 15, and 30 minu tes, are ordered by tha authorities for further testing the efficacy of the in. vention.
The extrnsive imnprov ements which are being canied out at Chatham dockyard, and which are progressing rapidly, will have the effect of making that establishment one of the most commodions in the kin gdom.

The whole of these works, together with the ereotion of a large police-station, wiU involve an outlay of 59,000C. The galvanized corrugated iron roof over No. 7 slip, erected by 3fessrs. Grissell, has also to be lengthened upwards of 60 feet, at an expense of nearly 3,0001. Several hundred convicts are also employed In the extension and improvement of the dockyard, the estimated sum for convict labour alone for the current year being 160,0001.
The ganboat Algerine, in Woolwich dockyard, completely fitted out for the China expedition, is now ready for sea, and will proceed to Greenhithe to-day to be swung for ad justment.

THE NEW REFORM BILL.-At an entertainment
TiE NEW N EForM BI3I,L.-At an entertailment given to Mr. R. Eall, M. P., Recorder of Doncaster, by Mr. G. Dunn. Mayor of that borough, yesterday (Wednesday), Mr, Beckett Denison, hI.P. for the West Riding, in reply to a complimentary toast, said he bad now bnen elected for the West Riding for the fourth and, be believed, the last timne, (" No! no !') He said for the last time because he felt that in the first place he had arrived at the 11th hour of his life, and in the next becauso he believed that before another general election the West Riding would be cut up into smaller divisions under a new Reform Bill. He would not offerany objection to such a measureas thah, for he confessed that a constituency numbering sonie 37,00t voters was too large for any two memubers to do 3ustico to. He admitted tbat the time had arrived for introducing some measure of Parliamentary reform, and ho should certainly vote for the second reading of such a measure, unlesswhich he did not expect-it should go too far. In that measure of reform Doncaster would in all probability be included as one of the new boroughs authorized to send a member. if not two members, to Parliament, for he found on looking over the statistics of population that Doncaster, Rotherham, and Keighley were, in point of numbers, the three largest unrepresented towns. Mr. Hall, in returning thanks f,,r the toast of his health, said in the present state of political parties it would be absurd for him to onter into any pledges, but he might say this, he should wete forthe second reading of the expected Reform Bill, because whether that Bill were introduced by Lord Palg-aent or Lord J. Russell he felt it would not be of so
iM s character that he could not support it, believing, iw he did, that the titne h_d artived for revising the repre4inati9n of th copntry.
Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties.
PUISTJIT of KNOWLEDGA uLdte DlkrPfULTIES. .
TO THE EDITOR OF TRE TIMES.
Slr,-In 1848 a school was first commenced in t0.a Vie. toru Dock district of Plaistow, in the Marsh, adi' 4ning the Thames, seven feet below high-water mark, in a situation
intersected by overflowing and stagnant ditl.ess, into which I aUthe sewage gf the neighbourhood is depo)sted, evaporatiorx into the surrounding atmosphere br.in; the only escape for it. This is the dismal xwanmp which supplies London with fog and much fever. The school was opened with 11 scholars oo'1y, and a liability of 351. a-year was necessarily ino'rred for rent of a cottage for the purpose of being used as a school and school residence. There were than only about 30 inhabited houses in the disrict, which was so poor that scarcely any subscrip. tions could be obtained, and the school was mainly sup. ported by the pence of the children. At the end of three years (in 1851) the first report was printed, and it recorded a debt of S6Q. 4s. 81d. as due to the treasurer, the Rev. R. W. B. Marsh, the incumbent of Plaistow, in whose district this swamp is situated. Eis income was, and is, under 1801. a-year.
Duringthesucceedingthree years agreatchangetook place the population of New Town, Plaistow (H3allsville), having increased to about 4,000 or 5,000, owing to the formation of the Victoria Docks and the extension of Mare's iron steamship building factory. A larger schoolroom then became necessary, and the school was acoordingly removed to another and more central site, but of course in the same swamp. At the entd of these three years (the school had now been established six) the debt due to the treasurer had increased to no less a sum than 101l. 18s. ln 1855, the seventh year of its existence, by great exertions-for the school had much increased in numbers-the debt was reduced to 97?. 5i. 8d., and in the report for that year Mr.Marsh stated that this was the most encoufraging year since the school was commenced. In 1856 the debt was increased to 991. 2s. lUd. ; this was partlyeaused by the increased charges upon the school funds and partly Fy the necessity for moving the school from the room in the cottage before referred to, there being no room for the number of scholars now on the books. There was no room in the place available; the sbed in which the school is now held was therefore built as the only alternative. It is to this shed that I wish more particularly to direct public attention in this letter. It has a lean-to roof resting against the outside gable wall of a small grocer's shop, and is situated nearly opposite HallaviUe Tavern, one of the numerous publichouses in this district. ft stands on a small and otherwise vacant piece of ground, for the occupation of which 3s. a-we ek is paid for ground-rent. This spot is part of Plaistow Marsh, and a mere swamp. It is totally undrained, and in wet weather scarcely approachable. Near It, a short time since, the incumbent ectually lost his shoes one night going to baptize a child. Such is the character of the locality. But to return to the shed. It is 30 feet long by 14 feet 6 inches broad; the extreme height of the lean-to roof against the back wall is 9 feet, at the eaves 6 feet 6 inches. The sides and ends of the shed (it cannot be caUed a building) are composed of rough waste slabs or boards, cut from the outside of balks of fir timber. The roof is of the same, covered with felt. The only light is from the roof, in which two sashes from an old greenhouse have been inserted. The glass is happily much broken, which, together with the rents in the boards, pro. vides for ventilation, which in cold weather is quite sufficient for most people's feelings in this cold, damp, and bleak situation. In wet weather the mistress literally is obliged to keep school under an umbrella, for, besides the broken glass, the roof is far from water-tight. The floor is boarded, and partly covered with cocoanut-m atting, which is a great luxury in such a placeo. The wh ole-cost of the school, ineluding fixtures and furniture, was about 141. only. This is, perhaps, the cheapest national school in tho lkingdom, aud bears witness with what small means the incumbent has persevered In the work of the church. In these schools it has been truly the pursuit of knowledge under difficulties. Yet in this small shed as many as 160 chUdren of both sexes havo been constantly in course of training, and have pased most satisfactory examinations, as testified by the diocesan inspectot- on more than one occasion. Moreover, for want of a better place, church services were constantly held in these schools during the time that MIr. Marsh had a curate. There was no other place of publiocworship in the vicinity, and these services were well attended. For want of funds even this was obliged to be given up; the reasons will appear from the following statement by the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone, MLP., who in a speech delivered at Chester on the 18th of November, 1856, quoted from the Ust of " Unaided Cases," in the last report of the Additional Curates' Society, the foUowing statement from the pen of the Rev. R. W. B. Marsh, detail. ing his own trials and difficulties as incumbent of Pla{atow, Mr. Gladstone commented upon it with impressive elo. quence.-(Vide T7h Times, November 20,1856, and Quarterly Rorl of Additional Curate' Societ., January, 1857):-
" It is uow many years since I Srrt appealed for aid from the Addi. tiosnal Curate' Society for my moest lahorions and diecouraging charge. Out of despair. I at longth had a curate on my own reaponsibility, kep0 him for two years and a-half, gave him £100 a-year from my insum. benoy, then worth aLUSo, my own means besides beIng only £70 a-year -found that I was oatreaning my Income. although living as economtcally as pos-ibl, making Leotto extoudeonslderably over 40 days-was obligedlast Uhristmss to dispensewith his services-have notyet cleare I my lst year's dellelency of Income-two services at dittant parts of my parish have baen comnpeUed to be dicontlnued-houso-toholue visiting becomae Impossfble-even the siclcunable to be attendedand au for want of help. My health is good- my strength, thanks to Go', far abovo mediocrity-my energies not yet relaxing -my temperament sanguine. With a curate, I might yet hope to do a Uttle io keel
my parish somwovhat under systematio treatment, althouhb, without exaggeration, it would require a staff of four at least to do effectual good, tho popnlation being 6,000, spread over a surface of four mfles by two, and sensuality ot every kind being fearfully prevalent."
The population Is daily increasing, and will soon be donble, triple, or even four times its present numbers.
To enable My. Marsh to resume this good work in a more suitable building, and with proper assistance, the Plaistow and Victoria Dock Mission has been undertaken. Need more be said to oommend it to a Christian public ?
I visited this school-sbed yesterday unexpectedlv, and I was as much surprised as gratified at the cleanliness of the children, and the order and disoipline maintained. N othing can bo better than the management of the present excellent mistress. The diocesan in3pector has each year certified to the satisfactory progress made by the children. The school is a mixed one, and there were about 80 children present. I must say I was surprised to see so much to admire in a shed, which in structure and accommodation was vastly inferior to many sheds occupied by cattle in the adjoining marshes.
The Bishop of London has giv en his cordial sanction to a plan for erecting a large and suitable building to be used as a school church, in which it is intended to have short services from the Prayer-book, suited to the capacities of the untaught and very poor. A site bas been obtained, but funds are stiU wanting to enable the pronmoters of the mission to commence the building. When erected, it is hoped, through the chil dren, to -win back the affections of the parents to their national church. It is proposed from time to time to invite them to instructive and amusing lectures, musical entertainments, &c. And at no distant date it is hoped, the blessing of God attending our labours, that we may be able to obtain funds to build a permanent churcb, with worshippers as well as priests. We want it to be in reality a poor man's churcb, with no exclusive pews.
The mission ary part of the scheme has been so fully set forth by advertisement, and especially in a small pampblet which may be had on application, that aU that is wished in this letter is to try and enlist the sympathy of the public, in order that funds may be obtained at once to provide a suitable schoolroom for the incumbent of a poor parish in the far east of London, 'who has shown that he deserved a better build ing by the extraordinarily good use that he has made of the limited means within his reach. It is a disgrace to the neighbourhood that this humble school should be nearly 1001. in debt to a hardworking clergyman, whoUy unable to bear the loss. His own particular schools attached to Plaistow Church are nearly four miles off, and
a0r-Io B a hleavy charge upon his time and purse, and it is hoped that with the assistance of the public press, which is never withheld in a good cause, funds may be speedily obtained not only to free these schools from debt, but to provide for the nobler building which it is hoped ere long to provide for this poverty-stricken district in Plaistow Mxarsh. I reside in an adjoining parish more happily eircumstanced,
but Ishall be thankful to receive any subscriptions for this school or for the mission, for particulars of which I beg to refer to your advertising columns.

Explosion On Shipboard.-Hartlepool, April
EXPLOSION ON S11LPBOARD.-HARTLEFOOL, April 7.-Yesterday afternoon a violent explosion occurred on board the iron screw co)lier Hutton Cbaytor, Captain J. Jefferson, lying in the Victoria Dock, by wbich two of the crew were seriously injured, though, fortunately, not dangerously. The Hutton Chaytor was loaded with Thornley gas coals, and had been lying, in her berth since Saturday waiting for a sea-tide. Twe.of the crew-the eecond mate and another -went down izto the fore hatch upon some necessary business, oarrying Jantern with them. On getting below the candle was removted out of the lantern, and an explosion instantly took plpte. The souttle. hatch had, fortanately, been taken off dUring the, forenoon, for the purpose of ventilation, or the injury would have been much more serious than it was. The fore hatohes. were blown oU, and the second zxatR wvas severely burnt about the head, face, breast, and hard;a The other man's injuries wero less severe, being confined to the back of the head. Mr. Edger, PurgeOn, was speedily ia atterndance-rupon the poor fellows, and bpth are progressing favourably.
The Great Tobacco Question.
THE GREAT TOBACCO QUS2EIOzO.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI3ES.
Sir,-Aro you really going to open your columns to the great tobacco controversy? If so, will you permit my small voice to be heard in defence of the weed ? I have perused with wordy care the long extract from the Lcancet in your edition of this day, and I quite agree with the triter in his truistio generalities. I will not undertake to defend sensuality and lapses of morality either in general tCr in particular. But when we have stripped the argument of all superfluous sermonizing about moral truths, whichhave their appropriate place in our nursery primers of principles,we finI nothing but a certain number of asseAions unsupported by proof, which, it may fairly be presumed, represent the individual opinions of the writer-'- Don't smoke early in the day." "Two cigars per diem are enough." "Youth and smoking ate hostile antitbeses." " There are physiological indications which occmnrini in any individual are cri4ra of excesa." Vlsalant quantum But, Sir, if we are to deal with this subject logically, mere assertions will not suffice. The only cases quoted by the writer are-one, of a man smoking 17 pipes consecutively, and anotter of a clergyman who smoked himself into a state of fatuity. It is difficult to connect thesecases logicalry with the point at isue. Once every two or three years we see recorded some case of monstrous bestiality, where death ensues upon a fabulous amount of wine or beer swallowed at a sitting, and the habitual drunkard is unfortunately not yet classable among extinct species; but why we are to be debarred from drinling our glass of bitter beer at Iuncheon, or why we are to be cut down to two glasses of sherry for our dinner on account of these exceptional enormities, it is not easy to see. The smokers all over the irorld are a very large class, and if yo-a were to poll them all round I should expect a very large majority to declare that the after-breakfast weed was the best weed of the day. They would willingly admit the habit, but would deny that it was "pe.rnicious," or that it was a " coolly premeditated sensuality" (oona reroa); and if you grasped their hands in greeting as you met them walking stoutly to their daily work with weed inumouth they would not tell you that they were a prey to disease. Against the two cases of excens quoted we have simply to place the undeniable faot that a very large body of men smoke ealy in the day-smoke more than two cigars or pipes per diem-have committed.these two enormities for years, and have not felt any the worse for so doing. We have fnrther to place against the isolated case of the clergyman of the Church of England who became fatuous (the condition of his inteUectual faculties b4fore his addiction to the habit ought to have been stated) the numberless cases of learned Germans who smoke an d toil all day, and the results of whose labours in every branch of science and LEseratuixe bedeck our shelves and instruct our minds.
Every true smoker will indignantly repudiate the state ment concerning drinking. It has, indoed, been hitherto a favourite theory among smokers that the cigar is hostile to the bottle.
That " there are physiological indications which occurring inanyindividualare criteriaof excess' isanobviousandgeneraltruth, applicableto a fnUlmeal or a longwalkjustasmmuch as to the extra cigar. Nature generally indicates the line of sufficiency to us in all that we do. We feel unoomfort-. ableif we transgress the liae; and, with permission of the learned writer of your extract, I shall continue to use the word " discomfort"' in preference to " physiological indications" when my transgressions compel an expression of feeling.
If the question of smoke be really one of serious importance, let it be dealt with in a serious and scientific spirit. In the days of my medical studentship (alas I too long ago) it was held to be sound reasoning and a wise procedure to collect as many cases as possible bearing upon and illus. traM;-.i of any particular diseased condition of our frame. When some hundred or two cases had been so collected we ventured modestly to draw a deduction, which we knew could have but a partial application, and which was liable to modification by any new case showing new phenomena as to the laws governing the disease under investigation. Let this system be carried out and made applcable to this cortroversy. Let the cases in which the after-breakfast weed has been pernicious-in which the cooUy premeditated sensuality of a third cigar has ruined hopes, reputations and lives-be enumerated and classiiedL Let us also know the temperaments and the other habits of these ruined individuals, Let us have a per contra enumeration of the cases in which men have so sinned, but have not so suffered, with a like appended history of their temperaments and other habits. We shall then have some data whence wo can draw healthy deductions and sound concln. siens. Until this be done permit me to smoke my afterbreakfast cigar and two after-dinner cigars in hopeful peace,
I am- Sir. vour faithful servant.

MR, COBDEN.-A Liverpool paper say8 :-" We have been favoured by the inspection of a letter addressed by Mr. Cobden to a gentleman in Liverpool, in which he ailudes to his own defeat at Huddersfield, and more espe. cially to the rejection by Manchester of Mr. Bright. Mr Cobden is in a delicate state of health, and states that his own exclusion from Parliament wil be a positive relief to him; but he feels acutely the course which has been pursued at Manchester, and declares his belief that political ingratitude was never before carried to such an extent, inasmuch as Mr. Bright's intellect, which is of a commanding character, has been shattered by too faithfully serving his constituency in the House of Commons, and he now finds himself dismissed with less delicacy than is usuaUy accorded to a menial in a private family. The publication of this
letter at the present time would excite interest, but, although I it treats exclusively of public matters, Mt. Cobden has marked it 'Private,' a feeling which his correspondent. respects. In addition to the mdifferent state of his own health, Mr. Cobden's happiness is considerably marred by the illness which prevails in his family."
A SmIP's CREW STARVED TO DEATn.-The following is an extract of a letter received at Lloyd's relative to the wreck of an English ship on the coast of Norwav. It is dated, "Stavanger, March 14.-A pilot on the 21 inst. boarded a vessel about eight miles from the land, orf Kinn, near Stavanger, dismasted and waterlogged. Found in the forecastle the bodies of six men, which he brought with him on shore, and another body was found between the cargo in the hold, which he could not succeed in landing. On one of the bodies was found an English Prayer-book, in which was written ' Joseph Bell, Slot-street, Hull, 1840,' and on another a double-cased silver pocket watch, on which the name of ' J. Buxton' was engraved. A certificate found on board proved the vessel to be the Holingen, from Narva, for Gainsborough. with a cargo of deals, &c. The vessel was found to be without provisions; the crow are therefore supposed to have died from starvation, especially as one of the bodies appeared to bear marks of having been attacked by the others to satisfy their hunger. Some of the bodies had evidently been dead some time, others only a few days."

The Merchant Service.
THE MEBCHANTr SERTIC3. .
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sirf,-Merchant offlicers ould not be but pained when they saw the " British merchant bervice" embraced in the animadverdions put forth in a leider of The Timcs of yesterday respecting atrocities practised at eea.
The merchant servioe is held in so little edeem even by themiddle classes of this country, and the difficulties of the merchant officer are so little appreciated, that I dread the public giving a wider margin to its censure than your,remarks might justify.
I believe cruelty on board of an English ship to be very rare. Throughout a wide contact with myjprofession aun during a long esperience I myself have never known'& case. On the other hand, the discipline that must obtain, if we would have either safety or despatch, rests entirely on the personal influence of the captain and his ofricers.
If the public desire to do justice to the merchant officer, let t1mm first look at tkings as they are.
The traditionalidea of a British seaman, as applied to the crew of a merchant *hip, is a pure myth. Our A. B's will imore often heave the lead inboard thxn into the water, white untrained men must be put on " look-outs," and our top men have yet their corduroys to weax out-add to this a dash of intense blackguardism.
I look confidently for this picture of the crew of a Britisbh merchant ship to become in a short time as rare as I hope the atrocities to which you have alluded are at present among us, but meanwhile I do not think I have overstated the fact.
The Mercantile Act profe6ses to give the power to main. tainsdipline; bhut in reality, in this respect, it is amere a'estraction, consisting of entries in the official log; and the eff6rts of the men hwve to be maintained st a high worldng point and the ship subordinated to discipline by the per. sonal character of the captain, and not by any fear of consequences.
One ship goes to sea with FOO pasengers, and another re. turns to port with 3,000,0001. sterling of treasure, and the eercise of such responsibilties deserves and requires public support and consideration.
Punshment may be repressive, but it does not improve. I have, therefore, no desire to see greater severity intro. duced, bnt Ithink the merchant service haa in its power to teach discipline to a much greater extent than is practised among us.
Tn viewing the merchant ship everything points to unity of disciplin andappearance. We have one common object. The nature of our responsibilities is exactly alike, differing only asto amount, whether we be smal or great, whether coastwise or sailing round the world. The articles by which the commander holds his authority, and the Marine law by which ha maintains discipline, are common to all alike, and it is properly within the scope of any merchant ship to train her crew and officersfor their duties in any other merchant ship.
But to effect this seamen must recognize in their officers a national class, and authority, and the quarterdeck must bo represented by a more uniform type. Thedifferentgreatcompanies and employments draw tbeir officers from every rt, and a uniform idea of duty saddiscipline would be maniestl
to the general advantage, and is positively necessary to wrork out those p arts of the Mercantile Marine Act intended to promote the improvement and welfare of the seaman. National reconition as a class, and a national uniform, in connexion with the Board of Trade certificates, wFould, 1 think, be for the general interests of navigation.

THE IRON TRADE.-The quarterly meetings of
f Th IRox TruADv-The quarterly meetings of the ironmasters of Staffordshire and East Woreestershire commenced yesterday at Wolverhampton. There was a full attendance. There are a great number of orders im from all parts of the continent, and home consumers are exhibiting their confidence in the maintenance of prices by buying freely at the ,quotations of the day, none of the princpal hoases evincing the slightest disposition to lower rates. It is owing to this circumstance that ther is an absence of the depression usalaUy incident to
high price of money. Indeed, one cause for the drai of gold from this Country to the continent is to be attri. buted to the many public undertakings of one kind or other which are going on, and for the first time to so large an extent. This re-acts favourably in the iron trade of this district, the demand for finished iron beinlg very great for purposes connected with the undertakings referred to. In addition to this there is more than the average quantity of iron going to Australia and India; and the Ecsntiness of stocks in the United States is evieenced by the faCt of orders coming in at this mo. rnent for immediate shipment, when the commodity must of course enter at the old scale of duty. These and other circumstances of more or less favourable co lplexion imparted a rigour of tone at to-day's meeting which could scarcely have been expected, and if the trade is not actullUy buoyant there are symptoms of a mole thorough action v hich has not at aU times been raanifested in periods of greater excitement and buoyancy. Before the meeting of so-day a great number of contracts had been entered into for pigs at fuUy 2s. 6d. a-ton advance npon the prices of last quarter-day. Good mine pig iron is worth 41. 5s per ton; at this figure many of the pig masters have sold the;r quarter's make. This, conpled with the advance which has taken place in the price, is the best proof of the large demandformanufactured iron. Thermakeofpigiron isas great, if not greater than ever it was in this district, there being an immense number of furnaces In blast. For cinder pigs there is no market; some of the fursaces at which this deseription of iron was produced have been blown out Coldblast iron is quoted at 41. 17s. 6d. to 51. per ton. The activity at the furnaces keeps up the price of stone; there were sales of blue flats and white stone to day at 18s. per ton. The general trade of the distriot is*reported to be marked by ess activity than usuaL. -
*Rso.-Of all the articles of genemproduce iinported into Liverpool, rice is almost the only exception to a profitable trade; for rice, though grain, and an article of food largely entering into the daily consumption of the masses in a pure or mixed state, is not an article belonging to the grain trade, though one would suppose that samples could be advantagoouslyintroduced into the Corn-exchange. The great rice districts of India, besides Bengal, whence we deriveour supplies, are those countries watered by the rivers Arracan and Irawadd and their tributaries. The stock of rioe in En gaud is at present large, and dealers, who look more to the statisticalfactsat bome, confine themselves ehiefly to the consideration of stocks and the demand upon them; but merchants take a more extended view in their operations, and, while considering stocks at home and the demands upon them, look aso to the prospects of the inerease or diminution of such stocks by the prospective imports from abroad. These observations are peculiarly appUcable to rice, the consumption of whih is obecoming more stimulated from the low price to which it has faUen, while the import, at the same time, is beob altogether discouraged. The imports of East India rice ror the four months ending the 31st of March last, were 17,000 tons, against 23,100 in 186; and the deliveries 41,000tons, against14,800; but the stock shows in an inverse proportion, being considerably In excess of last year, being 64,300 tons against 39,900 tons at the end of March last year, arising from the heavy importations caused by the large export of silver in 1855.56.-Lirmrpool Albion.
GAno=To rz BR aosTow.-In tie course of the last two or three week-s several cases of garotte robberies have been reported to have taken place in the neighbourhood of the Dyke-road and Upper Shoreham-road,-placs dmirably ada,ted for such operations. On Monday evening last, the 6th inst., another took place, which has led to Ihe detection of the party, three well-known characters, named George Holman, Frederick Frost, and James Poplett, who were taken before the Hove County Bench 3 esterday, the offence having been committed in that distxict. From the evidence adduced it appears that a nern named John Bimpson was walking along the Upper Shoreham-road with a woman towards Brighton, when they were met by Holman and Frost, the former of whom, without ottering a word, seized Bimpson by his neckerchief, while the other knocked the woman down. He then, according to Bimpson's statement assisted Holman in rifling his rockets, the woman having in the meantime recovered herself, anI ran off for assistance towards Hove, and she statea that about 100 yards from where she and Bimpeon were attacked she met Poplett, whom she asked to go to the i ssistsnce of Bimpson. Poplett walked slowly towards the place, and then all three prisoners ran off. Several persons came up, hearing the cries of " Murderr' and found Bimpson lyin s efied across a bank, where he had been thrown and left ny tue prisoners, who were apprehended on Tuesday, and at that time Holman and Poplett were together. It is thought that Bimpson, if the pressure off the throat had continned a few seconds longer itan it did, would have been mnurdered. All three weYe remanded for a week, when it is thought other cases will be brought home to them. A gentleman has reported he was stopped about the sameospot ,a few mainutes before the above occurrence.
"Relative Rank."
"e BBLATIXV RANK.7'
TO THE ZDITOR OF THE TImES.
S!r,-Having just read the report of Mr. Stafford's committee on the Army Medical Department, I beg to offer an
sXplanaptio on the vexed subjoct of " relativ rAUk," which Seems io have been very imperfectly comprehended by some ton. members, and which is of very gret interest to all medical offlicers. By the Queen's tegulationg, page 5, these gentlemen are assigned relatire rank solely for the purpoe of choosing quarters, and it is declared that "this indulgene"P is not to give them aclaim "toanyumilitary command whatever." By the strict interpretaion of thi' pansge, therefore, no medical officer can give a miitary order to any one, and he is, eZjure, a civilian in a red coat, &c. But the Articles of War, on the other hand, state that "aU commisaioned offioers"' have power to quell frays, &c., and even to put in arrest officers of any- rank therein engaged. They further state that "all commissioned offloers" are eligible to sit as memberxof courtsmarial (andI myself hare frequently been called on to do so). Now, from these eonilicting authoritie arise all xotts of mIsunderstandings most prejudicial to the service, and alo that laxity of discipline among medical officers of
arious ranks so truly pointed out by Lord West In his evidence. Some commanding ofiloers give effect to the medical officer's rank according to the Articles of War, hold the surgeon responsible, ihonld -he be senior officer at mess when any impropriety occurs, and 6upport him accordingly. Others regard him as totlly devoid of anyauthority out of his hospital, and consider that, shoqld he vish .a soldier confined, he must apply to his sergeant to do so. In the same manner as regards his assistant, -all he can do is to report disrespect or misconduct, and should the colonel or the general be buy, or indifferent, or hostile to the superior, he Is thrown over and laughed At, Upwards of 20 years ago I remember a distingai3hed Penin solar general insulting pn inspector.general with wbom he had a privateiquarrel, and who had umthinkingly ordered an assistant-surgeon on some duty, by asking 'ih3w Dr.
presumed to give any order. in this command?" aD4 reminding him that his orders were watepaper. Here is the key to a great deal that happened at Scutari A medical offlicer can only " recomnend" Anything, bo it ever so urgent, and report it, if -moticed or disapproved. He is blamed (like poor, good-natured Dr. Mensres witb his German surgeons) for failure, and yet hi success in arduous elrcimstanoes maybe rendered impo64ible by neglect, in. difference, or spite of other parties.
A xedical officer, thus devoid of any rank, is exposed to much mortification and to public disrespect, increased in effect by his wearing the dress and distinctions which on any other mans back would command such a diferent position. Suppose a board for inspection of a transport, a barrack, or a supply of stores, the youngest ensign upon it would sit above Sir John Hall, as a member, and sign the proceedings before him. Apply the same rule to al the varied ocausons of oontact officially aud socially in miStary life, and you will have au idea of the slights, and indeed authorized insults, to which a medical offioer is exposed, Particularly when he encounters a vulgar npstart who, jealous of the doctor's superior acquirements and pay, seizes any opportrnity to show that " that fellow is no officer at alL." Trae it is that such conduct is rare, and that, on the contrary, as the report prove;, many offioers in oommand are anxious to see theirsurgeonsin a position corresponding to theirmerits, and treat them aoordingly. But such kindness often leads to disputes. Some yeas ago a certin regiinePt gave a great dinier to the general in command, and had all the world to meet him. It became a question wlio'were to occupy the posts of honour on the distinguished guestls right and left.. The former - of course the commanding officer'claimed; the letter was disputed by the old; whiteheaded surgeon snd a young captain as second in oOmmxnd. The colonel decided for the tioctor; the capain appealed to the general, ufld, stSll dissatisfied had serious thoughts of " referring it to the Horse Guas" Parties Of course took different sides, and the prinicipals quarreled beyond remedy. Now, the hon. members of committee seemed to tink that the doctors seeking to have this remedied wished to be plad, AS a favour, on courtsmarial, andone sapient gentreman gravely asked lord Cardigan (above all men) whether he would recommend giving the surgeon command on parade (query 3,982)1 All that the medical officers want is to be granted their relative ranlk, not only in choosing quarters, but absolutely. It is clear that a man who is commisioned a srgee c only act as such! and could notpottibly require to be prohibited from claiming the oommand of a company, because he holds the relative rank of capEain. It is monstrous that he ehould be told he has no socid or profesdonal military rank whatever, and clled upon to sit below a boy ensign, though he may be a Companuon of the Bath I
The Commander-in.Chief evidently has a just value for mecdcal offlcer and is in favour of their having proper ranlc. Let his Ryal Highness, then, take Her KMaesty's pleasure, and, strdng out the words "in regard to choice of quarters," insert "an allr epecs Ma page5 6of' the Red. book, and he will confer an essential favour withiut expense, and wvith the very best advantage to the public service.
The proposed warrant for the reorganization of the department, as shadowed forth in the appendix of the committee's report would leave little room for improvement, and is earnestly looked for, or, at any rate, something nLalogous, even should the paybe clipped; but an oversight seems to have been committed ia granting relative rauk to sureons by lengthof total serviSo. As proposed, a surgeon unoer 15 years service ranks with captain, and one over that number, as major; now, officers not being promoted by seniority solely, w& should have lacky surgeons ranking as captains, while their juniors, slowly promoted, wonld rank as majors.
To avoid this, we propose to have all surgeons of 15 years' servioe commissioned as surgeon-majors like the Guards, and to let any distinguished surgeon, however young, be eligible for that grade, thus giving life and hope to all able and zealous officers Staff-surgeons and deputyinspectors would rank with lieutenant-colonels and colonels, and all work harmoniously.
Enclosing my card, I remain yours, much obliged,

RAILWAY ACCIDENTS IN 1856.-A report of the
RAILwAY Acormn s IN 1856.-A report of the railway accidents of last year is embodied in a blue-book of some 80 sage. It appears that in 1856 281 personswero killed ana 394injured on raTlroads inthe united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Of this number 112 were kiled and 16 injured who were neither passengers nor servants of the railway companies, 142 kiled and SO injured who were servants of companies or cmpRoy6s of contractors, and 27 kiUed ana 298 injured who were passengers. The first category includes 2 persons wvho committed suicide, 67 killed, and 7 injurea whiRe trespassing, 28 kiled and 2 injured at level crossings, 1 kiled and 2 injured while on a bridge which was thrown down by a load on a train, and 11 persous killed and 5 injured by being ran ovef or struck by trains at stations. Of theservantsof companies 30 were killed and 46 injured from causes beyDnd their control, and 112 were kiUed and 34 injured owing to miscondact or incautiousness. Of the latter 2 were kiled and 2 injured while shunting, 20 kiled and 39 injured from accidents to trains, and 7 kiled and 5 injured from being run down or struck by trains while disch *Ig their duties. One man, a guard, was killed by theab ow of a bridge. The greater number of those servants killed or injured from want of caution were crashod between buffers, run over, or fell from trains in motion. There is a large annual number of victims from being crushed between the buffers of carriages which are being coupled together. Of the passengers 8 were kiUed and 282 injured from causes beyond their control, and 19 killeUo and 16 injured from incautiousness. Of the 71 accidents reported on ia 1856 it appears that in 7 cases only were the accidents attributable to circumstnces which could not be guarded against, and that in only 3 of the cases were the aocidents solely attributable to such circumstances. In 27 cases the negigence of the inferior servants entered into the cause of the accident. The remaining causes of accident are classed under the folowing he
viz., defects in the construction of works or rolling stock,insufficiency of accommodation or appliances for safety,insufficient staff, and inadequacy of the qgteWm of working. A general review of aocidents reported since 180 shows tbat the great majority of accidents are attributable to causes over which the managers of railways have control, but wbich, from negligence or false economy, they do not remedy. What is called "negligence" of servants in cases of accident is often a habitual infrin e- ment of the regulations with the guilty cognizance of t%e managers, or else a praotice whic has grown up inthe absenceof definedrules. "This," obeervesthereport, "is an imp ortnt fact, because the public have a right to require that the traffic on railways shall bo conducted with the greatest attainablo degree of safety.' It is thought, on the other hand, that freedom from railroad accident is not to be secured by external interference, but by efficient and responsible internal management and the maintenanco of strict discipline. It is suggested that all important railway accidents shonld be inquired into publicly by a competent offlicer or trbunal, the coroner's inquest being a tribunal ill. suited to such inquiries.
OFFrCE: SEEKnRS AT WASEurGTON.-The gentle-s men who do the didactio and the reflective for the picturo newspapers have enlarged; in sentences more or less leaden, upon the moral grandeur of the inauguration spectacle, and have, with patriotic pride, spoeclated UPon tho wonder-not to say envy-with which the bedizened Ambassdors must have gazed upon the engine coinpanies and the Pennsylvania Miltia. Admitting that we had a fine melodrama on the 4th inst., we have now come naturally to the faroo. Wo certainly do not think that the diplomatic people ever witncssed at home anything lik-o this serabblo for place, this contest for collectorships and clerkships, this pother about post-offioes-in short, if we may use a coarse word4 this grand grab for provender. The Malakhoff Iwas not more closely inveded than the White '1ouse now is; and we verily believe that no Russian soldier in that stronghold was in half so much danger of his life as is our venerable President just at this time. We can easily imagine without personal obsarvation for we have only asked for the appintment of our frienid M) how poor Yr. Buchanan is bited, and bulled, and beset; how the hungry beggars do invade the privacy of bedchamber, and of library, and of parlour; how the perpetual knocking at the portals sounds in his ears like a certain unmentionable gentleman's tattoo-a rcvcilc of oontinually recurring wretchedness. We all know wvhat
chronic bother are the little girls and boys who come into our areas for broLen victuals; but what are they to the hordes of mendioants coming from all quartersa nd bawling for more cold picsof ptronsge than sany President ever had or eyer will have? 'We never before fully appreciated the nursery line which bade our chUldhood "pity the sorrowS Iof a po4r 914 m,ia"-,w Zork 2ribun,
