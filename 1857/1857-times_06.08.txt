A requisition, inviting MrI. Deputy Virtoe to accept the oflice of Alderman, had already recetveed a large numbes of elgnatsres, hot the prlologed absence of that gentleman in, Scotland. and his known lndle. position to a ecaba3t, dtterrea his friends from the energetic steps a20scssery to recurs his return.

That the premature canvass of the Ward on behailf of ainother Menleman before any reslIgnation had taken plane, or any comamuunlatlon could be) had with Mir.

IRBLAND. v om~ owwR n nv p -vqw DUBLIN, SATURDAY MORNG. THE DIVORCE BILL. The Tablet of this day announces that the Catholics, under the direction of the Cardinal Archbibhop, are " making some efforts at last to arrest the progress of that detestable Bill by which the Queen's Ministers propose to legalize adultery." After a considerable expenditure of ink in order to make it apparent that the marriage of Napoleon and Josephine was not dissolved by the authority of the Iloly See, the Tablet proceeds to denounce Lord Cranworth's Bil as the embodiment of all that is vile and repugnant to the Christian religion, concluding in these choice terms:- * It is not in the 19th century that the niatural man first felt the want of getting rid of his wife; he has tried it before, and probably in every century of the church's history, but he could not do it. The religion he professed was against him, and he -was forced to submit to the inexorable law, 'Let no man separate.' Lords Lyndhurat and Cranworth are not the first lawyers who kicked against the law of Christ, but their predecessors were notso stupid as to say that any earthly tribunal could dissolve a Barriage once complete. Henry VIII., in the fury of his lust, did not go such lengths as these * he always contrived that his 'arriages should have a jaw in them, for that Royal adulterer was not so intellectually corrupted as to imagne that he could be the husband of two wives both living at the same time. He was a better theologian than the sect he founded, and we must regret to-day that his cairtual ohildren do not better observe the principles of their father." THE TIPPERARY BANK. In the Court of Chancery yesterday a motion was made in the case of " M'Dowell v. Pepper" for an order of reference to the Master under the 15th section of the Chancery Regulation Act. The petition prayed for a receiver and a sale of the respondent's property, on foot of certain calls made against him as a shareholder which had not been paid. The suit was, it seas stated, framed as a mortgage suit, and was similar to proceedings instituted against Mr. James Sadleir and other shareholders. The Chan cellor had some difficulty in knowing how to deal with the case. The petition was framed as in a mortgage suit, regarding the calls upon the respondent as mortgages on his property, although it was very doubtful if they were so. He (the Chancellor) had formeed no opinion on the subject, but he believed the question, which was a most important one, was raised in some other cases of a similar character, inwhich ordersof reference had been made. It was, he believed, so doubtful that at that inoment there was a Bill before Parliament in wihich there was a clause declaring those charges to be mortgages, which was a sort of admission that they were not so now. It was, of course, impossible to say whether the Bill he referred to would pass or not, and it might be necessary to have an adjudication on the point. For the official manager it was contended that there was a case in Master Brooke's oflice, in which the question was raised by Mr. James Sadleir to have it decided whether those calls were mortgages or not. It was a very Serious question, and one that should be settled sooner or later. The Bill before Parliament prayed for a declaration that these charges were mortgages, and it was generally considered that even if the Bill deid not pass they would be held to be so. The 'Cancellor, in reply, said the question was a most important one as regarded both the shareholders and creditors, and that it would no doubt have to be adjudicated upon. He (the Chancellor) would miake an order for a receiver, but not for a sale. THE MEDICAL BEFOR31 BILLS. The rival Bills of Mr. Readlam and Lord Elcho have led to some diversity of opinion among the profession here with regard to the respective merits of both measures. The King's and Queen's College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland are both in their corporate capacity favourable to Mr. Feadlam's Bill, to which the University of Dublin has also given its assent. On the other hIand, the Queen's University and the Irish apothe. caries have loudly and vigorously declared their opposition to it, and the latter body is strenuously exerting itself in support of Lord Elcho's BilL It is objected to Mr. Headlam's Bill that it deprives the Irish apothecary of every right hitherto possessed by him, while the English apothecary has all his privileges preserved, and even largely extended. It is stated that, in the event of Mr. Readlam's Bill going into committee, it is the fixed intention of the Irish apothecaries to appear by counsel at the bar of the House to maintain their right of registration on the same footing as their English brethren. In this respect it is asserted that Lord Echo's Bill deals justly with the Irish, and hence the advocacy of his legislative attempt by the apothecaries. IRISH PRODUCE IN THE ENGLISH MARKETS. The Limerick Reporter says that a large quantity of potatoes recently exported from the Limerick market could not obtain purchasers on the other side of the Channel so as to leave a profit to the speculator, and that in some cases the article could not obtain a buyer on any terms. The consequence is that a heavy supply of those potatoes has been returned on the local market. TEE FUNDS. Three per Cent.

Commissioner Holroyd does not belong to a class of judges who have an ambition to win popularity, who are ever making attempts to mix up their judgments with some appeal to popular sentiments; yet we cannot but think that he has of late felt the influence of a prevailing gsnerml opinion, and has in conseqcuence been at least unnisual,y careful, if not severe, in his Judgments in the Bankruptcy Court. His legal denunciation of the conduct of the directors of tho Ro)al British Bank attracted universal attention, and was deservedly admired for its research and its conclusions. On Tuesday he pronounced, in the Case of a bankrupt, namedThomas Ryder, anotberelaboratejudgment, which ended in his refusal to grant the bankrupta certificate, allowing him, however, protection for 21 days, to enable bini to appeal. The just grounds for this decision were that the bankrupt, though a trader, had gambled in time bargains on the Stocr-Excbange, had traded recklessly, and had made untrue representations of his circumstances to obtain credit. No person, except tbe bankrupt, is likely to find fault with the judgment; and we have only to praise it. Like the same learned gentleman's judgment asto the Royal British Bank, it wil do a great deal of good. Such judgments give an importance to proceedings in bankruptcy which they have itherto wanted. The withholding of a certificate, in conjunction with weighty reasons for the decision, is nearly equivalent to degrading a man for life, and we know no ordinary punishment more severe. It will increase the sense of responsibility iniall commercial men, and make them more carefuL They will at once learn that the pro. cess of whitewashing is neither so easy nor so certain as it has been at least generally represented. In fact, these two judgments of Mr. Commissioner Holroyd mark a change, if not in the actual administration of the law in bankruptcy, in what it was supposed to be, and will certainly effect a beneficial alteration in the popular opinion on the subject. If the Bankruptcy Court hereafter supplies the trader, as it is intended to supply him, with the means of getting rid of obligations brought on him by unavoidable misfortunes and not by misbehaviour, it seems likely to lose ita character of being often a help to fraudulent success, and to become a terror to reckless and gambling traders. Tbough it be made a merit in the learned commissioner that he takes no notice of ponular feeling, there is evidence in these two judgments that it has had considerable influence over him. It is not poasible for any man living, though he may himself aot be conscious of the effect, to escape the i'fluence of a well-weighed oonclusion gene. ally adopted, such as that which some late facts have forced the public to adopt of commercial morality. Se might as well hope to live out of the common atmosphere. While in a Judge it is excessively weak to flirt with popularity, and allow every temporary general feeling to find an expression in Westminster-hall, it is only a proof of his good sense that Le learns the wants of society from prevailing o inions, and, as in this case, recognizes, we think, if he does not acknowledge, the general conclusion, that judgments in bankruptcy bave very often been much too lenient, Continually we find the polioe magistrates and judges punishing offences with unusual severity, because they are rife at the moment. In so doing they defer to what is, or is supposed to be, a awant and an opinion of society, and juntify the statement that a judge should be influenoed by zaiumastanees and by popular sentiments. For several months, we may say now ror years, the public, startled by many very grave oftonces, have been alarmned at the laxity of commercial morality, and have demanded severer commercial laws. Suoh circumstances have influenced the minds of judges, and under its influence they very properly hunt up laws that bearaen the subject, and apply themi with severity. The improvemnent in such cases really begins with the faots which alarm everybody-a public sentiment is begotten by them, and it inaences the judges, leads to greater care in judgment, aud pro1iably to more severe decisions. The great merit and great atility of the judge is, not that he despises and over ooks this improved sentiment, but that he recognizes it and acts in conformity to it. His elaborate judgments and the public sentiments go together and enforce e4ch other. As one zesult, we may expect an improvement in the morality of commercial men; but by those who would set the judges apart from other mcortals and make them pure absactions of tha law, ndniiniistering its abstract rules, this im2pore. mesnt will he mainly ascribed to the law itself, while it is tokrably plain, from the judgeacting in obedieuoetoa pubce i 6erptmen4t without. spy new law, that the improve.st zeo1i7 begia with it.-Economie.

THE VICTORtA MILITARY HOSPITAL, 2B TLEF' TO THE EDITOO OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In the course of Friday's debate in the House oF Commons Sir J. Rarasden is reported to have stated, on be hall of the Government, that the plans for the above grear military hospital had "received the approval of the highest medical authorities," while, on the other hand, Mr. Stafford affirmed that the building was "being constracted in defiance of all those sanitary precautions which our bittec experience in the Crimea ought to have taught us." If either of these hon. gentlemen desire to enlighten the public as to the real merits of the case, let him movo for the production of two memorials on the subject addressed to Lord Panmure by the medical officers of the Middlesex Hospital in the spring of the present year. If, again, after reading these memorials any hon. member should stand somewhat aghast at the infatuiation of the War. office, and desire to know what authority there is for the itatement that the plans have received the approbation of the highest medical authorities, let him move for a commit. tee of the House of Commons to make a searching inquiry nto the whole subject. This may give a little trouble, and perhaps not be very 8greeable or calculated to "keep things smooth," but when I read in the B,itish Medicde Journal of the 30th of May an article which speaks of the Netley Hospital as "a con. Spicuous engineering blunder," and affirms that "as at present devised it will kdll more patients than it will ever' cure," Icannot help thinking that the tax-paying part of the public would like to have a little more information than they at present possess before they are called upon to pay the little bill, the first instalment of which is 70,0001., for toe foundation I wonder whether building a hospital ou the banks of a river notorious as an ague didtrict is likely to increase tbe mortality aaong the patients as much as it augments the cost of getting a ecure foundatior for the saperstrac. ture. In other words, I wonder whether the undertaker will conme in for his fair share of the money, or wheth6r hne architect and builder will have it alL I am, Sir, your obedient servaim A D:X-PAYS; .one D,

TER ROYAL BRITISHBBAVK. (From the Obserner.)X The offer of a reward of 2001. for the apprehension of Mr. Humphrey Brown is the first public evidence which has been afforded of the intention of the Government to bring tojustice the managers and directors of the late Royal British Bank. Forsometime past most energetic measures had been in contemplation by the Government, but for obvious reasons it was not deemed pradent to give publicity to the course which was under consideration. On Tuesday last however, Bench warrants were issued by the Courtof Qaeen's Bench on informations filed by the Attorney.General, not merely for the apprehension of Mr. Humphrey Brown, bat for the late governor, the managers, and a number of directors of the bank, several of whom have been already arrested, In the case of Mr. Owen, the firet director captured, bail was tendered, and by direction of Mr. Justico trhe e prisoner was liberated on his own recognizsn ces of 4,0004, and two sureties of 2,0004 each. A similar bail will, it is anderstood, be accepted in the case of the other directors. Two or three of the persons implicated, at present in Farit, are, if not already in the hands of the officers, at least so completely under their surveillance, that escaoe is altogether impossible. With respect to the late manager of the bank, Mr. Cameron, there is reason to believe that, if he hasl not already been, he will shortly be arrested, at Paris, by the French police on a charge of traveling with a fale passport, and when that charge is disposed of he wiiU of course be available for the warrant i!ssued by the Queea's Bench. For some weeks last every one of the persons connected with the lbank, and who were recently examined in the Court of Bankraptcy, have been closely watched by Inspector Field and his staffof assistants, and every change of residence, and especially those mide after the delivery of tho very strong opinion expressed'by Mr. Commissoner Holroyd, nave been very carefully noted and recorded. The prosecution wiU be conducted by the Attorney-General, assited by Mr. Edwin Jameg, QO-., and so great has beenthe despatch in the preparation andgetting up of the case, that the whole of the briefs, occupying many hundred pages of printed matter, havo for some days past been ready for delivery. The indictments will, it is understood, exceed in length those of the famous Irish StUte trials. Messrs. Linklater and Eackwood, tho able solicitors of the assignees of the bank, wiU act as solicitors for the prosecution. There is reason to believe that the activity and zeal of Inspector Field wil result in the apprehension of the whole of the persons in the course of a very few das. Several of his asistants are already on the continent, aad it was rumonred late last night that a telegraphic despath. had been received, stating that two captures had been effected in Paris. The followmingisa copyof the placara oTering a reward for the apprehension of Mr. Brown:- £ Z BEWARD.-Humphrey Brown, of No. X Litte Smith-trkt Westminner, late hLP. for Tewkesbanry. A warrantfor the appreheasion of the said Humphrey Bro having been laued by one of the judges of the Court of QQeaos iBench upoa an ex-oficto inform3ioun med by her MaJesty's Attorey-General, and it being supposed that the maid Humphery Brown is endeavouring to avoid arrest, a reward of 2 wil be paid t3 any Person grinu such informatlon as aU leai to tbe apprehealon ofthe id Eumphrey Brown. HumphreyBrowu Is about 50 yeas of age, of middle starnre (about 5 feet 8 inohesl). rather stout, but not corpulent, bald, with round faee and small features, of saLtow complexion, with smalL whiskers aud dark resless eyes. Dresse generally in a body coat, and has a prompt and quick manner. Information to be given to Inspector Field. Eldon-chambers, Devereux-court, Templo; or to Meeccam J. and J. H. LinTkater and Hackwood, 17, Size-lane, Loundon, the solcitors having the conduct of the proweution. While, as will be seen by the above advertisement, the Government have commenced criminal proceedings against the defaulting directors and managers of " the thing miscalled a bank," the creditors and shareholders of the concern will be glad to lean that the Bill brought in by the Attorney-General to facilitate tho winding-up of this muchlitigateaffair will very shortly be pawed into law. The Bistands for committee for to-day, and although some amendments have been suggested, bearing on the case of the Tipperary Bank, it is not probable that they wiiU retard the progress of the measure. Immediately on the passing of the Act, the assignees already appointed wivl be, in the 'words of the Bdll, " deemed, and taken to be, and they are hereby constituted, the representatives of the creditors for the purposes of the Act." Acting as representatives of the creditors, the present assigiees wiU have the power to compromis vrith the Ehareholders, so as to bind all tho creditors; such compromise to be sanctioned, however, by the CommIssioner of Bankruptcy, or a Master in Chancery, according as either of these courts may have juriediction in the matter, and all actions brought by individual creditors as against shareholders will be sayed immediately on the appointment of the " representative." As a large majority of the creditors have already consented to aceopt a compromise of 16s. or thereabouts in the pound, there is no doubt that the proposition will bo approved by the Commission#rs in Bankruptcy, after which the creditors may look forward to very speedily receiving the remainder of their dividendas. Mr. Wyld, M.P., who has been most actively employed ever since the stoppage of the bank, in endeavounng to effect a settlement of its affairs, convened last week a meoting of the principal solicitors engaged on the part of the shareholders and some of the creditors, and obtained their assent to the principles contained in the BilL and it was understood that no opposition was to be offered by or through them to the passing of the measure.
IoPRovY-rAms IN LoDox.-Observing Alderman Cubitfs remarks on providing suitablo lod ing-houses for the poor, I would guggest a one remedy that all manufactaring trades, such as potteries, glass-houses, tallow-melters, bone-boilers, and varnish makers, and, in fact, all objectionable trades not actuaUy required in London, should be removed at least 25 miles from the metropolis. This plain.would scatter the working classes over a large spaoe of country, and prevent the necessity of retaining so many small houses for the poor in London, and it would allow of the worst portion of small dwellings to be cleared away altogether, and make room for the contemplated improvements, in forming new streets of a superior grade, on the same plan as in Paris. There is no more necessity for objectionable trades and manufactures to be carried on in this metropolis than there is for bricks being made and burnt in any of our west-end squares. It only requires the good sense of the inhabitants of this great city and the resolution of Parliainent to eradicate at once all the nuisances from the heart of the town, and at the same time confer a lasting boon on theworking clasees,-by removng them into a more heslthy atmosphere, instead of the conined courts and alleys they now occupy. If these said factodes were removed from town to country, the workmen mniut follow and take all their families with them. What a.relief this would be to :Ldvn l-CorresPoudent of 2'/f NWsitr.
RIALWAY IXTEZLIarZOB. NORTF-EASTgEN. A special meeting of this compay was held on Satrday York; M. ldermha Leeina, depltY-chairman, pre. After the usual prelimnaries, The CH&IRM" said the meeting had been called uider the provisons of the Wharacniffe Standing Order of the Riouse of Lords, for the purpose of submitting to the proprietors two Bills which were now before Parliament. The, tirst was a Bill for amalgamating the Hartlepool Dock and Railway Company with the North.Eastern Company,. n for vesting the undertaking of the former -companyui that of the later, and for other purposes. He explaineI thatBGmre time *go au arrangement had been made between the rio Cmanyand the Hartlepool Company, whichn enabled either of the companies to require the othertoe aSDRa1gratett on oerhain terms, Twro yeam jago the8 MratleP°eI Company had intimated a desna toha theatPxt f the arrangement which provided, for the amil6amatiou sbould be carried out, and the object: Of this Biu was to obtain the authority of Parliament forthat purpose.. By the agreement referred to the Berwickz Company was to pay the Hartlepool Company for 31 lears. (nine of which-were expired) a divide~ndaftertheate of 8 per- cnt, per annum for the leaseof the line, andat the termilnation of the lease the Harttenool Company would take whatever 'dividend the Berwic sectio of the North-Eastera was receiving at that time. He MOved, in the usuLal form,. t h e a p r o v al f t h e e eti,gt o t h e firstB ill Mi£. Darham-a scondfield lFh the motireons tad reon.in mobeheved by the haan, referrian feeaer tctaemto the words' eand forothaer urposes" whchhe lnthought ought to boe The Cp ssRMA-, said the direectj had no sii ostte in view, and they could not therefore accede to.Mr. Simaa'ex sggestion, wbich me with no suppoh rt from the moeting, and on the resolution being put it 'Was carried by f very large majority. The Cnroxugh said the next B iM which he had to submitto the aeeting had a threefold object. in the firt place. the directors wished for powers to en the itsiEaatOe, an Company to make a branch from their Bishop Aueklanoth branch railway to the Conside ironworks. They ha nowcompleted and Opened the Bishop Auckland brnh, w)hich.a ss into one cf the most extnsive coalfields in the coh-ty of Durham-a coaifield which the directors had everyreasom to believe wol)d be an important feerder to the main line OF the North-Eastern PRailway. The length of the pro e-p branch was 12.b mvles, and would be congructed a+t a totu cost of120Oht., being onlyl 10O.00.per mile. The director. were quite satisfied that they would derive by the fomation\ of this branch not only a large amount of mineral, but eilk, wise of paenger and goods traffic. At the head of Uzlr'Lanohester valley, along whicha the line would run, there. were the Conside ironworks, having 1S blast futnaeeBl in operation. The quantity of iron.stone which was at_ present being conveyed to theme worr o was from SOD0,000 t3. 400,00d tons per aonnum, and about 100,00 tons of maufactured iron were sent away from the works every yearg Besides this there was an entirely unhworked coalfel4 ani a popuation of about 15,000. He contended that it wrdesirable the North-Eastemn should undertake the formaetin of this lne. The secondo object of this Bill ws to ask Parliameut for powers to purchae additional t ands, chiefly for the enlargement and improvement of two orthre of the principal stationsy on the North-Eastern The third object of the Bill had reference to another branch railway,ecalled the Dearness Valley, runnin3 out of the Bishop Alcklnd line in a directon westware, towards a pltace caeld Waterhouse, and where it would bejoined by another branch, which rnms from tne Stockton and Darlingtonraiwy The length of the linie was five ralees, and the ei rdost 40, O O This line would pass through a field of the best coking coal, which, f. r- want of raue way o ommunication, bad hitherto remained unworked. In ourder to obtan this communication, and to secure an influene in the under taing, some of the directors of this company took shares iuit to-theextent of 15,0D00. Afterwards the shareholders of the INorth-Eastern assntedl to a resoluLtion that the company should take the, share for which t'he directors bad become responsible, sineawhich time the Dearness Valley baa been proceeded with, was now in a state approachint comrpletion, and the dicectors believed it would be highly remunerative, and felt that it was mnost desirable that this company shouli have powers to enter into an arrangement for the entire- purhase a ontrol of the Dearness Valley Railway.

How he raged and roared in the latter days of the last Parliament, whose end, indeed, he had a large sharo in hastening by his violence How he protested against the extravagance of the Ministry, and. vowed to stand between the country and the rain with which it was threatened by the profligate exp&nditure of theGovernment I He was to knock off at least two millions. The country was to be sure of one mau to keep watch and ward for its finances. Mr. Gladstone was to be a Josspbn Hume on the largest scale, 'with the addition of the highes; oratorical powers. Such were the expectations encouragedl. What has been the realization ? The navy and army eitit mates have namsed, and Mr. Gladstone's voice has never been heard. Mirsters have walked over the course. They have had all they asked for without a show of redinoe, or even. a murmur of discontent. Mr. Gladstone's opposition which loomed so mighty in the closing days of the, last Parliament, has proved a mere fogbask* a thing of vapour. What can be the meauing of this? Has. the member for Oxford undergone a metamorphosis, and been changed into a misb ? Or has hb, by5 ha y less miraculous process, become an altered and a wiser man by the lessons of the elections? Has he discovered that the7 country does not like anything in excess, not even the profes.." sion of economy 7 Or is there some little personal disap- pointment in the cse ? He had set his heart on having ay. follower, profanely caUed a tail, if but of one joint. How he spouted away in Wales day after day and night after night, vwherever a handful of electors could begatheredtogether, topersuade the good folks that his brother-in.law was the man to aid hbi in saving the nation theatened with ruin from LordPalmerston'sgudtyextravagance. The Welsh, however, were quite unmoved by Mr. Gladstone's oratory, and chose a representative just as if there was no question about thesalvation of the nation. The consequence is that MrGladstone finds himself in the Honse of Commons without a single follower. The Peelites re scattered to the winds, or the few left have bcen taught to sober their pretenaions, Mr. Gladstore finds himself alone, and his courage is not ofthat sort which rises with an exigency. If the Government. had been as weak in this as it was in the dissolved Parliamnent, active, vehement, andunspariDgwouldMr Gladstone have been in his attacks upon it. In season and out of season would he have raised his indignant voice against theruinous extravagance of the estimates. But against Lord Palmerston's assured majority Mr. Gladstone's soirit quailsHe is not the man to kick against the iricks. E Wales hewas told to his face that he was a polftioal craven. let usrather hope, however, that he has seen theerrorof his 'ways, and that his present silence is not owing to the causes u gested, but to a late discovery of tke factiousness of his. courses on the budget and the China question. The turri of the elections, assisted by reflection in the interval pre. eding the assembling of Parliament, mxy have revealed shis truth to the mnember for Oxford. Whatever my be, the fact, we have been moved to touch upon this subject by the questionswhichbegintoarise in different quarters,- hat has become of Mr. Gladstone? what is le doiog9where is his voice? Mlany bave asked whether he has. slipped out of Parliament altogether unobee-ed-whtheir he was turned out of Oxford, and other such simple. questions.

MONB-lMABKBTamdiCITYINTlLLIGBN1iB. Saturday Evening. The funds opened with firmness to-day at the inmpa oved quotations of last evening, and uibsequently exhibited increased animation. This, however, was cheeked by the India and China telegraph announcing a continuance of unfavourable rates of .e:xcbange, and an extending spirit of mutiny in the InLdian army. The lirst transactions in Consols for nioney were at 93i to 94, whence they advanced to ; k. At the official close the price was exactly 94, ,,nd after regular hours operations were effected at (r I for money, while for the 9th of July there were eOllers at 94i, or 93 ex. dividend. Bank Stock left .Off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92A to i ; New Three per Cents., 92i to J-; India Bonds, 8a. to 4s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, June, 6s. to 2a. dis-count; March, 2s. discount to 38. premium. On Monday the June Exchequer-bills are to be st nt in for payment or renewal. Judging from the closing quotations to-day, it Beems probable that in nmiqry instances money will be demanded. The transfer books of Consols andIndia Stock .el se on Tuesday. Foreign securities have been rather firmer, but the operations contin'ue limited. Turkish Six per Cents. for the account were purcbased at 94s. There was an absence of business in the Four per Ctnts. Guaranteed. The general transactions in.cluded Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., Small, 974; Spanish, Passive, 56X; Spanish Certificates, S3 and i; and Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents, t97. The Medway has arrived with 18,000 ounces of sold, and the bouth Carolina with 20,493 ounces, ;xnaking a total of 38,493, valued at 153,9721. About 85,0001. out of the 126,0001. of gold brougLt by the Sydenham was sold to the Bank to-day. In addition to the 48 0001. by the Australian mail I he gold announced to be on its way to this couutry ~ly private ships amounts to 601,6401., one-half of Ma hich may be expected from day to day, and the -Trmainder within three or four weeks. The specie arrivals of the week have amounted to 3,700,0001., of which 213,0001. is from America, 0;82,O0O0. from the West Indies, and the remainder .rom Australia. Of the latter the major part has Atill to arrive in London. The telegraphic advices from India and China to-day show no material alteration in the rates of exchange, but the general tendency seems adverse, 1From Shanghai it is stated that the shipments of -silk had reached 84,000 bales, and that quotations were $15 per picul lower-a circumstance which appears to indicate that the supplies coming down were at least as large as had been anticipated. The fact that the 1,125,0001. to be paid to Den-=ark in redemption of the Sound Dues will have to -be remitted in specie or its equivalent during the next three or four months must constitute a new element of disturbance in the money-market. The extent and duration of its influence will in some *degree depend on the use to which the money is to te put by the Danish Govermment. If they contemplate its speedy disbursement it will soon find itS way back through the regular channels of trade; but in is possible they may intend to hold it npermanent deposit. The total which the Danish (iovernment have to receive from all countries, Great Britain included, is about 4,000,0001., of which Russia will contribute 1,090,0001., and iPiussia 493,0001. These States, however, will .doubtless avail themselves of the privilege of mnaking the payment in half-yearly instalments, spread over 20 years,8with interest at 4 per cent. The railway meetings of the week have prcsented rome features of interest. The dividend of the Dundee and Arbroath Company has been confirmed at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, and the report has been adopted. It is stated that the revenue o! the company shows a steady increase through the general development of the population and trade of the district. The shareholders of the Great Western Company have sanctioned the proposed clauses in several Bills before Parliament for carrying out working arrangements with the steam service between Weymouth and the Channel Islands, the Lartmouth and Torbay, the Bridport and Stratfordupon-Avon Itailways, &c. The resignation of Lord Barrington as chairman was announced, Mr. Ponaonby taking that position, while Lord Barrington will continue to give his assistance as deputy-chairmlan. The preference shareholders of the Great Northern Railway resist the alleged injustice of throwing any portion of the losses occasioned by the frauds of Leopold Redpath upon their dividends, and a committee has been organized to oppose the Bill promoted by the directors. A subscription of 5 per cent. of the amount of dividend has been commeuiced to meet the outlay. At the Cork, Blackrock, and Passage meeting the report was received as satisfactory, and a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum was declared. The traffic has lately improved, but not in the full proportion anticipated. The shareholders of the Bombay.Baroda, and Central India Railway have adopted the report, and the discussion which took place was principally with respect to the line from Bombay to Surat, the construction of which is strongly advocated. At a -meeting of the KiWlarney Junction Company the dividend declared was at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, leaving a balance of 2,1901. to be carried forward. The dividend of the Belfast and BaDymena -60ompany is at the samne rate, the disposable balance reaching 15,7491. The quarterly dividend of the Leeds, Bradford, and Halifax Junction Railway is at the rate of 5 per cent., it being considered impsudent to trench upon the reserve fund. The main route is stated to be in efficient condition, and a further increase of traflic is expected. Advertisements and placards have been issued *fiering a reward of 2001. for the apprehension of Hr lumphrey Brown, late M.P. for Tewkesbury, wvho is alleged to be eiideavouring to avoid arrest from an ex (tticlo information filed by Her Majesty's Attorney-Genleral in connexion with the aflairs of the Royal British Bank.

SFATZ OF TADR. T brO agb-a asmamMtAiNgCHnESTER, Jtrii 6. There was but a small meeting on the Exchange this maorning. The holydays have been almqost general through. out the week, and the fact thatpreodnction lhas been ro mtch lessened by the stoppage of mills this week entirely, and the agreements to woric only 40 hours per week during the month, is giving greater strength to prices and creating a more cheerful feeling in the market. In both yarn and cloth rather more business has been done, but the aogregate busineEs has not been large. The manufacturers of Acring ton have resolved to work short time, and the movement is becoming more general than on any previous occasion for many years past. The failure of Mr. WilliamMackintosh wholesale haberdasher of this oity, has been announced' and the liabilities have been estimated as high as 100,0001. BrtMINGHAM. JuNg 6. The most material event connected with the ;uanufactur. ing trades of the town and neighbourhood which has occurred during the week has been a further reduction in the prices of copper and tin. That of the latter is to the emount of -s. per owt. - making common blocks 134s. 6d., rFfined 138a. 6d., and ingots and bars in the usual proportion. When the lastreduction took placein the price of copper, a month ago, we predicted that it would speedily be succeeded by another, and so satisfied were the chief D antifacturers of brass and coppergood3that such would be ibe case, they refused to purchase to any extent at the lower mates announced, and made but few alterations in their dis* ounts. The effect of the last reduction, declared on Thursday, is likely, however, to have abeneficialeffectnaon the manufacturers of the town and greatly increase thotrade of the iactors In brass and copper goods. Stoc, in consequence of the high price of metal, have been extremely low for the last 12 months, but now they have more nearly approached the rates of years when the manufacture was more active 'ban of late. An unusually large demand for bras3foundry is anticipated. Within this fortnight some good foreign orders were received for these descriptions of goods, more fspecially from South America and the West Indies, but the country trade has been dull, and one or two establish. mnents which are usually among the busiest have not found full employment for their workpeople. The large ironfounders of the neighbourhod continue to be tolerably well employed. In the vicinity of Dudley the largest establishments are busy, nd at tonrbridga the chain manufacture, chiefly for marine purposes, continues to be extremely active. The South Staffordshirairontraderemainsveryateady,with no indication of any immediate alteration in last quarter-day's prices. The North American orders improve, more particularly for the Canidas, and there is every probability that no change wiMl be made iu quotations at the approac. iLU ,quarterly meetings. xi e o1 urrlme of the Whitsun holydays and the vit of the Duko of Cambridge have had the effect of impeding businews in most of the principal manufactories of thie town and neighbourhood. In many establishments employment has been almos entirely suspendecd, and muchl Inconvenience has consequently reslted to manufacturers.. It is Eatisfactory, however, to state that in most branches there is evidence of improvement, and that many of the leading factors are full of orders. At Kidderminster the first dividend of lOs. iu the pound from the estate of the late Farley and Turner, bankers, through the instrumentality of the Court of Chancery, has given the highest satisfaction to the trading community of that town. It is understood that a second dividend will be announced very shortly, and that the favourable anticipations set forth in the balance-sheet will be fuUy realised. LEICESTER, JuNE 6. The hosiery trade is dulL, and very little has beon done during the week in consequence of the Whittuntide holy. dlays. The worsted mill3 have been also doing nothing. Mlaterial, both yarns and wool, continues at a very hign rate, At Louohborougb, Himckley, and the country d'istricts the hosiery trade is as inactive as reported a week ago. LEEDS, JUNE 6. The woollen cloth trade has been quiet during the week. The Whitsuntide holydays have somewhat interrupted the ordinar course of business, which has also been partially checked by the excitement occasioned by the boreugh election. The foreign demand for goods is only limited at present, but the home market is pretty healthy, although purchases are not made in very large quantities. A moderate amount of heavy cloths, snitable for the winter trade was cleared out of the cloth-halls this morning. The inquiries for summer fabrics are nowgraduallygettingless;but, upon the whole, although the tone of trade is without animation, a tolerably steady business was transacted this morning in oomparison with the average amount of cloth disposed of for several weeks past. Some of the locad wool-markets have commenced. At York, on Thursday there was avery fair show of wool-between 300 and 400 sleets, Some dispusition was evinced on tho part of pnrehasers to lower prices a little, but selers were firm, and ultimately nearly al the wool shown was sold at about the same prices as ruled the previous week, when as much as 22s. per stone was given for the very best clips. At the Pontefract woolmarklet there was a moderate supply, and a good attendance of buyers. Sales were very brisk, and prices varied from 15s. to 21s. 6d BRADFORD, JuNE 6. With regard to the actual amount of transactions there is not much alteration to report in the condition of the worsted trade; but a general improvement is noticeable in the tone of business, and brighter hopes for the future are entertained. In the piece trade, notwithstanding holyday week. there are more inquiries for newdesigns in = goods,anda,tolerable number of orders are given out; there is no material alteration from the prices recently current. The late cautiousness of production has restricted stocks in the warehouses within a comparatively narrow limit. Yarns partake to some extent in the better feeling. For export the demand is more extensive, and where a slight decline is submitted to orders are given out pretty freely; still, as the prices offered are generally lower, the spinners are little benefited by accepting them on speculation. There is also more doing in the home trade. Cotton yarns are without change. There is not much yet doing in combingwools. A determination is evinced by the staplers to hold with firmness to late rates, from which a reduction is unsuccessfuUy attempted; the buyers, therefore, defer making purchases herever practicable until the arrival at market of the new .lip, of which, with the continuance of the present highly favourable weather, liberal supplies are anticipited. In former prices are adhered to. lotingmoos reainfin inprice, with a good demand. TTATLIFAX, JUNE 6, Trade bas been exceedingly quiet during the week. Transactions have been verv few and small Perhaps in wool a little more activity lisa been apparent, but still atinners have a decided objection to purchase further than .teir immediate wants warrant them. Prices may be said to be fully maintained. In yarns no change for the better is observable. More inquiries have certainly been made, but prices offered are somewhat less, so that really for the spinners nothing is gained. The piece department is very flat, scarcely anything having changed hands except a few Orleans and some damasks. It is generaUy expected, however, that an improvement will shortly take place. NORWICH, JuNE 6. The manufacturing trade continues rather dulL A good dealbas been doing during the last two years in crinolines, but of late there has not been quite so much activity in this article. The monthly circular of the London, Norwich, and Nortbampton Boot and Shoe Company states that shortness of hands has obliged some Norwichi manufacturers to work overtime, and the pressure of accumulated orders begins to be severely felt. The continuous increase of this now staple trade must be gratifying to all who seek to advance the prosperity of Norwich. With regard to the trade generally, the same authority adds that business has been more regular than usual for the month of May, -which is more advantageous to aU parties than the general rush for goods at this season of the year. At the same time, the high price of money has evidently been a check upon the speculator, and confined orders to the legitimate wants of the trade. There is no improvement in the men's trade, but the demand for women's and children's goods is as active as during the preceding months. Orders continue to arrive from the colonial markets, and the retail trade is going on very steadily. BELFAST, Ju.i.5L LmIN .-In Armagh there was little change, either in supply, demand, or price. In Lurgan lawns and birdseye diapers were scarce and dear. In Ballymena, on Saturday, there was a dull trade and little doing. Linen yarn unaltered. FLAX.-The markets have faUlen off so considerably, and stocks are so reduced, that buyers do not coasider it advisable to attend them, unless on the fair day in each town. We may look on the season as over fcr this year. COTTON.-The sale of goods at the largest sats of the manufacture has falen off, and, though spinners seem unwilling to move on the short-time proposal, the present state of the markets wiU very likely force them to adopt that blternative. Raw cotton sels at faUl rates. Yarna go off at the prices of last month, but finished calicoes and mnusliAs cannot be sold at rates equal to the advamce in production. Fine Jawns are looked for, but bayers wiU only take small parcels. The cry of short crops for this seaon hba. been raised with great intensity, but, after all, it is evidenthat the resoures of supply are rapialy incressing

CUNnING OF THE Fox--A gamelceaper on th3 estate near Lochawe, who bad been annoyed by the depre. dation of foxes, discovered a kennel in a glen at the side of a snall loch. While watching one evening for the apnearrauce of the tenants he observed a brace of wild di cks fl ating on tbe loch; in a little while a fox was seen approse iing the water side with cautious steps; on reacbing it he picked up a bunch of heather and placed it in his nmouth, 8o as '0 caver his head; then lipping into the water, and immerSng all but hts nose,he floated slowly and quietly down to where the birds were quacking out delight in fancied accurity, seemin nothing near them but a banch of weed Indae time ne neared the ducks, dropped tbe heather, and substi tited a bird, with which he returned to *he 1ochsie aud was making off to his youtg with the prize, w>len the keeper, who had noted all his nivemenb cloed *Sem h Ithe dischuge of his double-barrel Surely auo'. aci deserved &better fate,-!SoQkhPqpgr

SALZ OF POISOa BILL. TO TME EDITOR O jTHE TIME3S Sir,-Your adnoirable remarks on the " Sale of Poisons Bill" will meet the approval of, the great body of thea ebynists of thia.country, as welltahthat of tie. pablio im general. The " Sale of Poisons Bil" is- a very crude producion, and is evidently the result of very imperfeat information. Many of the poisons enumerate1 axe among ths most valuaable of our medicinal remedSes, and which. thonsands, especially ameag the poor, a-e in the covstant habit ofe uassg. InL this town, and in many other parts. of the eastern. counties, vast quantities of opium and lazdanum are used. and it would be impos3ible under the provisions of the Bill to supply the eonsumers witim,hose drugps. Tbe registration of the salo of some of tbe more virulent; poh,ons it mght be desiruhie to carry. out, but I believe. that the grentest security is- to be obanined by.raising the character of tie vendor, by nUowing no ersontoseU poisons. who is npt fully qualifled, by rendeing. the vendor in. a. great measure responsible for the sale.of'all poisons, and br visiting any neglect or V,'nt of caut3an. on his part with, severe penalties. The position of the chy nist wulcld- b greatly imnroved by makiDg the examinatio:%. of the Slharmaceutical Society compulsory, and in futre allowinao.perpsroto. ooramence. the usiness who did mot possess& the certificate of. that. society, as a gnarautee-ofIhis fitne-;s.

LONDON, MONDAY, JUNAE 8, 1857. "The way of a man is right in his own eyes." The original of the proverb has a more special reference to a supposed class than our purpose requires. In fact, every body, every nation, has a way of its own, and that way is always right in its own eyes. Every now and then it receives a lesson shtong enough to shake its confidence in everything it ever did, or thought, or believed; but in due time, generally a very short time, it returns by inevitable tendency and by an overwhelming logic of its own to its own old way. One proverb is enough at a time, but another will probably occur to some of our readers bearing on the point. Now, wbat was our way of teaching officers and men the art of war up to four years since ? It was the old English way of doing things,-regular, comfortable, heavy, dull, and expensive. The men passed their time between the barrack and the publichouse; the officers were doing everything except learning their profession, and a dull routine of parades was pretty nearly all the duty required, or aU the instruction given. When the time of trial came the officers were found ignorant of the art of war, and the soldiers incapable of taking common care of themselves. The danger had been foreseen, and a school of war had been opened for a few weeks at Chobham. However, the war brought to light many serious deficiencies, and it was found that henceforth our soldiers must be not only trained in larger masses tLan heretofore, but taught to rehearse the hardships, the emergencies, and the small shifts of actual campaigning. This was the idea of Aldershott. It was to be a reproduction and perpetuation of Chobham, the site of which was no longer at liberty, and which was not adapted, so it was said, for a permanent camp. We may, however, appeal to any of our readers whether Chobham was not the germ of Aldershott, and whether the modifications of the original idea were not to be of a still more decidedly and practically military character I It was expected that in the very outof-the-way and desert tract of land selected for the purpose war could be taught in that rough, active, and various shape that was not so easy in Hyde Park, on Wormwood Scrubs, or on Woolwich-common. The soldier was to become a more real soldier, and the officer also was to acquire more knowledge of his profession. It is true that, with Sebastopol before our eyes, the public acquiesced in the substitution of wooden huts for canvass tents. It is also true that from the first moment a spade was put into the ground the subiect teemed with suggestions of a progressive and substantial character. Everybody who ran down to Aldershott for a day, and stiUl more every officer who had to leave snug quarters in London or Brighton for a bleak Hampshire heath, had a ready model for injurious comparisons; and it soon became evident that Aldershott had to be built, and that not iu a day. By this time the reaction is complete. The nervous fit has left us ; we have recovered our senses, and our old way is right in our own eyes. Wood is better than canvass, brick better than wood, and stone more ornamental than either. "Unexpected difficultiea have been found "in the foundations." They always are. Difficulties are never expected in this part of a structure; they always come, and always bring a frightful expense. At Aldershott, however, " unexpected difficulties'" have occurred, not only in the foundation, but also in the hut walls, which shrank and gaped; and in the felt roofs, which rotted. Ax the wooden huts are now decidedly under a cloud, in ill favour with the officers, pronounced dangerous for men and too cold for horses, we may set them down as doomed, notwithstanding the half-million or so t hey may have cost the nation. Not a word is said about .canvass, except that Lord PArMxRSTON has seen men pitch a tent, and thought it an easy and rather pretty operation, which a man need not be all his life learning. So, as nobody can live in a wooden hut, and anybody can pitc-h a tsnt, Aldershott naturally collapses into an affair of brick-,. mortar, and about five thousand men. It is to be a central dep6t for the protection of the southern coast, like the old depats at Canterbury, Maidstone, and Chatham against what was then supposed the chief point of danger. This is an age of improvement, and the humane public insists on reading-rooms for the men, on separate quarters for the married soldiers, on covered parade-grounds, and on superior lodgings for the officers. If these are given anywhere, nowhere may they be so justly expected as on a naked heath and a bleak hiU side. If they are necessary in St. James's Park, much more in Hampshire, 40 miles off, and without even a good town to go to. Then, of course, the site must be drained and roaded, and levelled and gravelled; and, though a thousand of the soldiers are daily employed on these operations, the work must come to an end when there are no more roads or drains to be made or gravel to be laid down. Then, as for teaching soldiers to cook and to wash, it is cheaper to cook by gas and to wash by steam; so, when you have once taken your company through the beefsteak and mutton-chop exercise, and drilled them in steeping, soaping, rinsing, hanging, and ironing, it wil be as wel to revert to more economical agencies. In fact, what we see in Hampshire is the natural process of civilization. In this way has the human race passed from nomad to settled life, from waggons to tenta, from tents to huts, from vilages to towns, and from towns to great cities. That is the ultimate destiny of Aldershott. It will soon be found a matter of economy to substitute a good high wall for the cordon of police now drawn round it, and there will be the additional advantage that the presence of the officers will not then be so constantly required. Our grandchildren may even see a circle of fortifications. In this way Rome, in this way our own London probably arose; and future ages may see both eclipsed by our English Simla, the military metropolis of Southern England I We are aware that we only make ourselves thoroughly ridiculous, and incur doubts on our sanity, by demurring to the necessity of so natural and usual a development. If Aldershott, however, in its original intention was to be only a town, or a mere military dep6t, or collection of barracks in a healthy and central situation, then we could have suggested a course by which the object could be more rapidly and cheaply attained. In our simplicity we supposed that it was to be a school of war, and that armies were there to be taught how to fight, how to march, and how to exist, without having houses, shops, coalholes, canteens, quartern loaves, rations of beef, butter, cheese, tea, coffee, and sugar always at hand, and the gas and water always laid on. We did not perhaps imagine, as Mr. S. HEnEBB seems to think, that every now and then a troop was to make a sudden foray on a farmyard, and carry off a cow or a pig, all the poultry or the cabbages,-in fact, such proceedings are not permitted to British soldiers, even on service. But we did expect the soldier was to learn more, even in the vulgarities of meat, drink, and fuel, than he usually does at Knightsbridge or Portman-square. The experience of the last war shows that something was to be gained by knowing how to kdil cattle, how to skin them, and what portions of animals were fit for human food. The same experience suggests that it is rather awkward to discover for the first time, three thousand miles from home, that the tools wil not cut the wood or break the ground; that there are no means of roasting or grinding green coffee; and that nobody knows how to make a hut that will keep off a day's rain or wind. If the camp, if the canvass, if the small arts of military life, are all given up, and if nothing remains but a large barrack in an unusua'ly desolate and inconvenient situation, what have we to expect ? The answer is already provided in the recent order substituting the Wednesday for the Tuesday and Friday reviews. The review itself, after generally dwindling into an inspection, is permanently reduced to a quiet affair upon one afternoon in the week, about 25 or 30 times a-year. Even this will be voted "a bore" before long, and in a vast mass of expensive structures, costly to keep up, and forming the nucleus of a perpetual demand on the British purse, will be quietly entombed the grand experiment for teaching the British officer and soldier the real art of war. No doubt Aldershott, with barracks for 5,000 men, can at any time be turned to account. With plenty of room, open, central, and healthy, it will have aU the potential utility on which the PBninmn rests with such entire satisfaction. There have been 18,000 men there, andthere is no reason why at a month's notice 50,000 men should not there fight over again the great battles of their country. On the faintest apprehension of danger we shall have plenty of pageants of this sort. Common sense, however, suggests that education is not an affair that can be put off for emergencies, and that every day's delay is here a positive and irreparable loss. We have a right to expect that now, in this very month of June, 1857, officera and men should be learning the art of war at Aldershott in all its branches and varietiea; that the officers may be learning all the duties that they may ever be called on to perform, and the men also acquiring all those smaller arts without which strength and courage may be thrown away. As far as we can hear, excepting that 1,000 men are daily employed in the construction of roads, the troops have had no practice whatever in those military earthworks of which every war England ever engaged in, especially the American, Peninsular, and Russian wars, has brought out the paramount importance. Suppose the 50,000 men that imagination has posted on Aldershott-heath threatened by the rapid concentration of three or four times their number of continental forces, landed at Dover, Portsmouth, and Plymoutb, we presume they would think it necessaiy to intrench themselves, with only a few dayg to do it in. Have we 50,000 pair of hands, with heads to direct them, who could be trusted for such a work ? But earthworks have often to be run up in a day-ia an hour, and important battlea have turned on their efficiency. This is but one point. Lord PALMERSTON, only too happy to be held responsible for the design of Aldershott, does not mention one single point in which that design is now being carried out. Future ages may have to thank him for well situated barracks, with an ample space opportuinely rwesAe frea the advance of oultiv,%- tion and house-building, but for the present we have to thank him for very little indeed; at least, for no present fruit that he has shown us.
It would be perhaps too much to say that we feel apprehension at the continued prevalence of a mutinous spirit in the Bengal Army, but still we cannot but think it the duty both of the authorities on the spot and the Government at home to inquire at once into the causes of this mysterious disaffection. A few weeka since the l9th native Infantry was disbanded, and it seems that the 34th ought to have shared the same fate, for, if the telegraphic news which we publish elsewhere is to be trusted, the most dangerous designs have been formed among its native officers, no doubt with the sympathy of the entire regiment. It is also stated that the 3d Bengal Cavalry are in open mutiny. Such a condition of things suggests abundant matter for consideration. The stability of British power must not even be suspected in India, and we ought to know enough of the Asiatic mind to be convinced that the fact of one regiment after another disobeying orders and assaulting its officers without fear of summary retribution must work a speedy change in the spirit with which the Indian races regard us. Awe, respect, and confidence, if not love, have always been freely rendered to the imposing fabric of British power; but among people who are as quick to be elated as discouraged even a short fit of excitement and a passing dream of independence might work incalculable evils. The excesses of Barrackpore and Meerut demand prompt repression and vigilantprecautions, lest they should again occur. Inlegislating for the future, it is of course principally necessary to ascertain the causes which have produced the present discontents, and we think that these lie deeper and are more permanent than is generally supposed. To bring high-caste Hindoos into contact with lard and tallow i, of course, a mistake, but we doubt if it would in itself lead to disaffection extending over several months, and shared in more or less by an entire army. Those who know India well, and, what is of great importance, know it of late years, are not unprepared for the appearance of a restless, sullen, disorderly feeling, without aim or design, on the part of the milions 'whom we rule, and especially of the troops. In fact, the stir and uprising of the human mind in these days of activity and material change have extended from the English race to their subjects. At the same time that by education, by a glimpse of history and natural science, by the spectacle of railways and telegraphs, and by the great events which have lately passed in Europe, the Hindoo has been roused from his sluggishness and contented acquiescence in all that surrounds him, a more dreary and depressing quietude has descended on Indian life, both civil and military. In the old times, when the Sepoy had no knowledge and no ambition, there was pretty nearly always something for him to do. An enemy Was always on our frontier or on the frontier of one of our alies; there was some protected Sovereign on the point of rebellion, or of being murdered by a kinsman for not rebelling; there were tribes of robbers, tribes of murderers, or gangs of fanatics, to be put down. But now we have conquered all enemies within and without. From Affghanistan to the Irrawaddy there is no prince or people who dare oppose our power. A quarter of a million of native soldiers are now transformed into a vast police. There is no activity, there is no excitement; nothing beyond the monotonous discharge of routine duties, with the prospect of a pension in old age. We cannot help thinking that this dull and aimless existence is too much even for the apathy of a Hindoo. The fidelity and the military discipline which did not fail with C-LrVn at Arcot or with SALE at Jellalabad have been shaken by years of barrack life, with nothing to think of but drill and cleaning muskets, and nothing to hope for but a sufficiency of rice and calico after a quarter of a century's service. It is fully credible that the mutinous troops do not know what they want, and do not even pretend to want anything. So far there is no great grievance to be remedied, and no immediate daner to be apprehended. But this very fact indicates a kind of permanence in the discontent which evidently prevails. The causes of this discontent arise from the very nature of things, and, indeed, are likely to become more powerful every day. We can well imagine the effect on the quick, suspicious temper, of a Hindoo of all that is passing in India. Everything around him is in a state of change. He hears of hundreds of people carried 25 miles within an hour, who before would not have been able to travel that distance in a day. The messages of the Government are transmitted from Calcutta to Bombay in a few hours. At the same time schools are opened which will teach his children that all he has learnt is false and absurd, and that the wisdom of Europeans is the only true one. He cannot conceal from himself that these new instructors must in the end prevail. At the same time there are bands of teachers who are telling all who will listen to them that Hindoo religion is as false as Hindoo science. These men may not have as yet made much impression, and may eveu be unfitted by want of judgment and learning to make the best of their cause. But, reasoning by analogy, the Hindoo begins to fear that they will win the battle in the end. The people who are superior in strength, in knowledge, and in civilization must, he thinks, be likely before long to make their religion prevail. Everything that seems like a step in this direction is a new shock to his pride and his most cherished feelings. Action and tho pursuit of wealth may make the ordinary Hindoo indifferent to the threatened sub. version of his faith. He buys and sells, or works at his trade, or waits on his European master, and is contented because he is occupied, and has a certain amount of liberty of employment and locomotion. But the Sepoy has time to brood over imaginary wrongs and to suspect that he is subjected to cunning temptations. The knowledge that the European officers are few and the white regimnents are at a distance may give him courage to express his discontent by a kind of sulky obstinacy. Evil tongues, and that strange freemasonry by which one Asiatic people learns what is passing thousands of miles off in the territory of another, may, at the present time, have tempted the Sepoys to more open manifestations. The mutiny itself is not so dangerous as the smothered discontent living and smouldering year after year which the mutiny indicates. Resolution and severity are required at once, but a cautious examination of the subject and due provision for the fature should follow speedily. It seems beyond a doubt that a large native army, very much under-officered, and with nothing stirring to do, must be subject to these fever fits of fanaticism. Whether it be not necessary to remodel the organization of the Indian force, to increase the number of white troops and the number of of bcers in the native corps, is a question which has for some time engaged the attention of some of the most experienced men in the country. The matter becomes one of surpassing interest when we are told that a mutinous spirit has shown itself, not only at Barrackpore and Meerut, but at Dinapore, Lucknow, Agra, and Umballa. It may be that tbis ill-feeling is the last stand made by the Miudoo mind against the growing influenoe of European eulture. It in not impowible that at a time when widows are Uarrying and men of all castes are sitting together in a railway carriage the last efforts of bigotry should be made. In a few years much that ditinguishes the preenrt generation of Asiatics will be swept away. It i1, however, not the less the duty of the Government to take measures for making the transition as safe and speedy as possible.
A pretty commentary on Mr. HIousFATsraS motion against the Board of Trade was furnished the very moming after by a deputation from the Railway Proprietors of the United Kingdom, which waited on the Board with a memorial expressive of their desire to give the whole of this enormous property the benefit of the Board's supervision. It appears as if shareholders, though certainly representing no insignificant amount of commercial intereat, instead of thinking that the Board had too much to do, and consequently did its work inefficiently, would be by no means indisposed to see its sphere of action materially extended. Very likely, Directors may now and then rebel against the ineonvenient req uisitions of an inspector, but it is clear that, upon the whole, the great body of persons interested look upon the powers of a competent Board of Trade as calculated to do them more good than harm. We cannot say that the arguments of the memorialists induce us to modify the views we recently expressed upon this subject; indeed, the essential weakness of their case, in so far as regarded the prospects of any appeal to Government, became evident at every point of the proceedings. None of the alleged grievances, whatever might be their reality, could possibly be looked upon as serious enough to affect this immense mass of propertyin the manner or to the extent assumed. The "operation " of the Parliamentary system" in encouraging competition may surely now be considered as a thing of the past. Competition, with all its attendant conflicts and expenses, may have been terribly destructive in times gone by, but its powers must be pretty well spent at present. With regard to the assessment of Railways to the Poorrate, it was " not so much the rating" that was complained of " as the unequal and unjuxt mode " in which the rate was levied." In respect of the damages recoverable from companies in the case of accidents, the gravamen seemed to be laid in the graduation of penalties, bywhich apassenger, though paying no more than his neighbours for his seat, was enabled to recover more in case of injury simply on the ground of his superior station. But this law, whatever may be its intrinsic merits, is as old as the institutions of our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, and, what is more to the purpose, it applies not only to Railways, but to all other modes of conveyance. As to the " abstraction of parcel " traffic"' by the Post-office, we have already said that the ground taken on behalf of Railway Proprietors is utterly untenable. They could not possibly do in this way what is done by the Postoffice with its completeness of ramification and machinery, and, if they lose a little business by the practice, they have no more title to complain than the thouaands of persons whose avocations or profits were disturbed by the railway system itself. The gist, however, of the whole case is not in the soundness or unsoundness of any of the particular arguments by which this or that grievance was sought to be established. It lies in the obvious fact that all these grievances together would hardly touch the real evil under which the memorialists are suffering. That evil is the unproductiveness and the depreciation of their property, and, though it might possibly be a little mitigated by such consideration as they now request, the only genuine and drastic remedy is that 'which rests in their own hands. It was said at the interview that the working expenses of eleven of the companies-yielding, we presume, a pretty fair average of the whole-amounted to about 50 per cent. on the receipts. This leaves 50 per cent. disposable; and would not that provide a pretty good dividend if there were no claimants on any score except that of the capital fairly invested in the construction of the line? We do not enter into the question of the proportion which working expenses are thus made to bear, but 'we put it to any shareholder practically acquainted with the subject to say whether there is not a far larger margin for savings in the improvement of railway administration than in any such alleviation of imposts as is now asked for? We doubt if there is any considerable line in the country on which more might not be saved in any one year by the judicious action of the proprietors themselves than could ever be realized through all the alteration for which the memorialists apply. It seemed to be urged on behalf of the possessors of this particular species of property that the investments had been made to the infinite advantage of the country, and that, consequently, the shareholders were entitled to consideration, not only as ordinary members of the commonwealth, but as public benefactors. This, however, is going rather too far. No doubt, Railways represent a most serviceable institution, but it can hardly be assumed that those througgh whose instrumentality they were constructed contributed their funcds on any principle but that of private interest. They simply selected what they thought a desirable investment for their money, and if the public gets the benefit of the venture that is no more than can be said in the case of gas companies or water companies. Indeed, every such transaction must originate in some presumed public advantage, or it would be impossible to anticipate either popular support or legislative sanction. However, there is no need to press this considera- tion either one way or the other. Nobody would' question the expediency of adopting any just measures by which railway property could be restored to its fitting value. The interests at stake are undoubtedly entitled to attention, and it matters very little on what grounds this attention is given. What we say, once for all,[is that Railway Proprietors do certainly possess in their own hands the means most calculated to effect the object desired, and that nothing within the power of Governmeut to accomplish could produce half as much good as they could accomplish themselves. We believe they might obtain all they now ask fcr without finding themselves in a much better position at the year's end, whereas we are confident that by better management and an improved system of audit they could at once bring themselves round. We have no desire to cast past sins in their teeth: let bygones be bygones by all means; but no good can come of reliance upon legislative aid where the true remedy lies in self-reform. The position of Railway Companies generally is simplythat of bodies who have acquired in the mere matter of receipts all they could possibly hope for, but who have expended so much in the acquisition that the result does not provide a balance reniunerative for the outlay. There is no complaint to be made of the public or of its practices, or indeed of the speculation itself, reasonably regarded. Nothing vas ever prophesied of Railways which has not been much more than fulfilled. They have driven all other modes of conveyance absolutely out of the field; they have carried more passengers, more cattle, more coal than anybody could have conceived possible; in fact, the traffic almost exceeds their powers of carriage. On one[ of the principal lines it is said that a thid hlne o' rails could be employe with constant .1antagr; and on all good lina the least aordir<y timulus, such as a sight, a holyday, oi even a week of fne weather, uisuaUy taxes their capacities to the utmost. Here, then, in the first material for commercial. sucoess Provided in abundance. Receipts are actually Overflowing; what absorbl them is the interest on ercessji capitals coupled with the outlay upon unproductive branches and un5emsy under takings. Companies have been almost as bad as Government Board in " works and publio build- ings," and have suffered from a perpetual draia by their quarrels with one another. We are sure that if any one of the deputation were to take pen and ink and enter into a genuine impartial salculation, he would find that the imposts levied on R ailways by external authority were a mere nothing compared with the burdens which they had imposed upon themselves. We do not say this in any spirit of ill will or censure; we state it merely to indicate the right coure of remedy. If Government can do anything in fair mitigation of their hardahips we should rejoice to see it done, but we are convinced that the only permanent and effective remedy is to be found in their own activity and earnestness in investigating and reforming their own concerns.

On Friday evening the workmen commenced remoing the screens and orchestra erected for the opera concerts, and byMIonday the gigantic orchestra for the 2,500 of the Festival, crowned by Gray and Davison's organ, will be fauly exposed to view. It ha now been decided to take down the enclo. sures of the present concert-room and of the sculpture court on the opposite side of the transept, and to fill these spaces with balf-gnines seats, which will be in fall viewr of the orchestra and excellently placed for hearing.

Ai INcwDr or OF mo ROyA Visrr TO BmmqGHAM.-The Birmingham Police-court on Satmrday was crowded to excess by professional and other gentlemen anxious to hear the particulars of an assault cae which has caused a good deal of excitement in the town. The complainant was Mr. T. R. T. Hodgson, a solicitor of standinz and ex-Mayor of Birmingham. The defendant was Mr. it IL Couis, also a respectable solictor. The asult onso plained of had its origin in these circumstances:-When Mr. RAtclZ the Mayor, and his guest the Duke of Cambridge left the banquet at Dee's Hotel on Monday night, his worship asked Mr. Hodgson, to take his place as chairman. Aoording to Mr. Hodgson, MIr. Colfis, who was also present, afterwards told him it was the Mayor's desire thrt the proceedings should not he continued much longer, it being then nearly 12 o'clock, though Mr. Colis says the Mayor's name was never mentioned, and that it was merely a private suggestion of his own. Be this as it may, there is Lo doubt that the Mayor had expressed no such wish. Hearing next day, however, that his hospitalities hua been cut short earlier than he expected, he inquired the reason, and Mr. Hodgson, told him it was done in consequence of the message sent through Mr. Collis. Mir. CoDis thereupon sent a letter to Mr. Hlodgson, demanding to know whether he adhered to the statement, and Mr. Hodgson replied that he did, couching his answer, however, in conciliatory and friendly language. In an hour afterwards-at 2 o'clock in the afternoon of Thursdav last-Mr. Colis desired an interview with Mr. Hodgson at his offices in WLaterloostreet, and then occurred what the latter thus described in bis deposition:-" I sat in mny chair with my feet under the desk, when Mr. Colis entered the room. He came up to me holding the letter in his hand aud said, ' Hodgspnr do you withdraw that letter P I said, 'No, bue'-and before I could add another word he struck me a violenthblow in the face with his fist. I said, ' Collis, let n,e have assistance, you know I am lame' (referring to the effects of a fractured right arm), but he immedi.telystruck me another violent blow in the face, which produced blood. I called out, 'Help l 'Murder!' and, wheeling round my chair, I picked up the tongs. In doing this the poker fell towards Collis, and he lifted it up and brandished it over my heiad He struck me with his fists eight, ten, or a dozen times. I became insensible, and remained in this sate until Dr. eslope came." Mr. Parkes, a clerk in Mr. Hodgson's offioe, proved that he had to burst the door open before he could render his employer any assistance. He found Mr. Hodgson bleeding and almost sensoless. Mr. Colliswas brandishing the poker, and said, "Stand back, or rll lay yoe straight; Pm a dangerous man." Mr. W. J. Beale, solicitor, and Dr. Heslop also gave evidence as to the state in which they found Mr. Hodgson. In defence, Mr. Collis gave the following version of what passed in the room *- " I said to him, ' Mr. Hodgson, do von adhere to the statements contained in this letter?' Sfter some hesitation he said he did. I then said, in a menacing tone, ' Mr. Hodgson, when you wrote this tissue of falsehoods you were, of course, prepared to take upon yourself the consequences?' Mr. Hodgson then said, 'Oh, Collis, I'll withdraw it; 'll write you any apology you like.' I said, ' Mr. Hodgson, isn't that letter a lie irom beginninz to end ' and he admitted that it Was. He azain said, '1 will write any apology you like,' and I said, ' Write it, Sir.' He began to write, but suddenly snatched up the tongs, flourished them over me, aud cried 'Murder' louder than I ever heard in my life. I immediately rushed to him, caught the tongs with my left hand, and knocked him dowrn with my right. As he passed me on his way to the door I repeated this right and left. I only strnck him three times." The magistrates committed Mr. Collis to take his trial at the borough sessions. He was defended at the oatset of the case by MKr. E. Wright, but having caUed Mr. Hodgson "a liar" in open court, the gentleman threwr up his brief.~~~~~~~~~P i LSR TEMTPLE.--The undermentioned gentlemen were on Saturday called to the bar by the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple :-Joseph Philips, Esq., M.A., George Copeina, Esq., 1LA., Edmund Sheppard, Esq., Richard Eillmau Daniel, Esq, B.A., Thomas Sidgreaves, Esq., B.A., William Robert Phelps, Esa., Thomas Sincar Clarke, Esa., M.A., Francis TothiL Esa James Muirhead, Esq.;' Walter Digby Somerville, Iisq., John Newmarch, Esq., B.A., Edward L'Estrnge Dewr.

I . GOLD WOKS IIN ENGLAND. People 'who only know of gold ia -1*Wg and who are accustomed weekly to read of the arrival of half.a-million In ounces from Austr4a, may bO 5urprhed to hear of, 'works for the crushing of gold quartz beiny Shaisbed in England. Nevertheless, such is the fact, and a a. remote corner of Cheshire-preguable only to Sirn railway tourists -an establish ment exist, not only for the convession of American quartz into ounces and ingots of the psecious metil, but which purposa to extend its auriferos re. searche3 Amo1g the mountains and quarries of EDglmd. Tho Chancellorsville Company, as it is called, has b . at work now enly for a short period, though long enough to found a tolerably extensive factory, if we may so term it, where Al the various processes necesary to the Production of the culating nedium from exceedingly dirty looking stones goes on daily. The imaterial upon which up to the present tl*y bvae tested their powers has been Virginian quartz from a gold-bearing district in the United States; but they intend to venture upon experiments with the English rocks, which, if successful, may lead to important results. To prove the facility and cheap. *ness with which gold might be extraeted from the American quartz a numbet of scieMtific gentlemen and others Interested iu the result of the scheme were invited down to the wrorks on Saturday, with a view to a public exhibition of the whole modu,s opera*6, and of course a display of its antidcpated profits. Frodsham, as some' of our readers ma3y know, is rather an out-of-the-way place, a long, hzy. looding town, with no particau interest in itself, or apparently in anYthing elle either. A third crow would be a souree of excitement, and, of course, under such eircum. stances the new gold-works are by no mess overlooked, hut form the staple of comment *nd converstion throughout the little town. Th visit of , large party of gentlemen especially to inspect thens and their results on Saturday will by no means tend;to alay this growing interes which seems f"t leding to the beUef that Frodsham is to lie at once the Bendigo and CLifornia of the Old World. In order that our readers may not be led into so grievous an error, we shall at once inform them of the processes now going forvard at Fzodsham, their present results, and (on the part of the company) future intentions and anticipations. The works are now solely engaged in crushing American quartz, or perhaps we may say ore, in which the gold is found. To those troubled with vague ideas as to gold being always picked lip, and realized with little laboar and no capital, this account of its " manufatare" from quartz will at least he new, if not intresting. The ore on which the Chanoelloravillc Company work is quarried from an extensive mine belonging to the company in Orange County, Virginia, a short disance from Fiedericksburgh, and wbich is brought over to this country as ballast. When delivered on the wharf of the works at Frodsham its cost is nearly 30s. per ton. It is a oGarse amorphous quartz, not unike rock salt in appearance, but lrgelyintermixed with Auriferous andargentiferons pyrites. Thi is first caicined in an ordinary Ikln topartily free it from sulphur, and assist the process of crushing, which it subsequently undergoes frotr the stampers, ftr being broken into smaller pieces. Tho stampers ued at Prodsham are ordinary Cornish ones,. of the most primitivo form, and such as have been in use throughout Cornwsll and Devonrfor many yers It is said that these do the work better than either Jones's, Berdan's, or Britten's quartz-crushing mschines, -which certainly seems singular; but what, perhaps, is more remarkable is that ordinary milL stones,-in fact, a common flour-mill will, it is alleged, crush it better than any. Close to the Frodshan 'worksstands an extensive flour-mill, at which 12 tons of the quartz have been ground finer than anything done by the stampers and crushing machines in the same period of time. The stones used were the ordin ary chert or millstone grit, as it is called, and the miUers aver that thig work wore them less than even grinding Indian corn. It must be remembered, how. ever, that the quartz is calcined before it reaches the mill, though, even masking this allowance, it seems rather a snub to our mechanical progress to have in the l9th century to revert to a practice as old as mankind itself. The machine used at Frodasham has twelve 7cvt stampers, which cruash the quartz to the consistency of a coarse sand at the rate of rather more than a ton per hour, or about 20 tons per day. There is, however, already sucieat steam power on the Premises to crush 50 tons daily if the snpply is forthcoming. From the stampers the crashed quartz flows with a stream of water into a series of "slime pits," labyrinths of narrow pipes at the entrance of 'which the particles of gold sink according to their specific gravity. From these It is shovelled up with the other matter with which it is mixed and placed on the "'shaking table," a long platform of vood fixed under a smal stream of water, and which by an alternate rise and fall allows the greater part of the extraneous substances to be washed away. Only a dark coloured sand. containing particles of quartz, gold, silver, copper, and iron, remains on the tablc, whence it is removed to undergo the process of fine grinding, which reduces it to an impalpable powder as soft as flour, and not unlike it, save that it glitters with minute specksof metal. Itis again calcinedinareverberatoryfuraea (to drive off the remains of salpar), which is so constructed as to prevent tho metalic particles of gold and silver passung up with the draught. Shafts arc attached to the furnaces in which the sulphur and any metals that may have been volatilized are deposited, and the yield from the former appears to be large. As the ore thus roasted a second time is found to contain a proportion of other metals, it Is thrown when heated into a bath of mineral acids by which the copper, &c, is dis. solved, and afterwards precipitated in the usual manner. For reamon of economy inuriatio acid is used, though the saving is rather in appeardace than in fact, as the chlorine in the acid must naturally dissolve a portion of tho gold also, and to that extent diminish the yield per ton. The auriferons powder which remains is finally passed through a stream of water under a wheel containing 550 magnete, which revolves at the rate of 15 times a-minute. This frees it from much iron, yet, as it is done to prevent the iron entering with the gold and interfering with amalgamation, it is simply ridiculous, as the merest tiro in chyraistry ought to know that between iron and mercary there can be no combination. The magnets are, however, useful for a duty which they were never intended to perform,-namely, pressing cut the arsenuret of iron. ETm remains flows into an amalgamator, in which the mercury and ore are agitated together, the activity of the former being quickened occaElonally by jets of seam passedthrough it. After a given time the mercury is removed and placed in a retort, where it is distiUed into water, leaving only a gold button containing a little silver behind. On Saturday nearly the whole of this Process was gone through on a small scale at Frodsham. A ton of the quartz was crushed, calcined fine, ground magnetized, and amalgamated, and the yield was 1 ounc4 7 Peunyweights 7 grains of pure gold, or very nearly an ounce and a half ner ton. It Is but fair to state that the experiment was tried upon one ton of quartz which had been shovelled up hap-hazard from a mass upon the promises. The average yield of the 'Virginian ore is stated to be lioz. per ton. It is very rarely less than this, and sometimes more. Half an ounce per ton, if worked upon the spot where the quartz is found, would pay all expenses, and even with the works at Cheshire and the mine in America 1oz., if the supply is continuous and the works weU managed, should give a fair remunera, tion. Twenty tons per diem are now reduced at the. lYrodsham works, at a cost in coals for amalgamation, 103oa of mercury, labour, sundries, and wear and tear of nm. chinery, of 17s. per ton, which, with the original price of the ore, raises it to 21. 2s. The local facilities afforded, at }!rodsham are very great; labour is cheap, there is waer, carriage by the river Weaver to the very door of the works and coals caa be had at 6g. per ton delivered. Under the circumstances there can be no doubt that crushing. aarL ferous quartz which yields lior. per ton ought to give a profiL It inust, however, he Shown positively that t.saup. ply of orefrom Virginia cabe reckoned upon as regnlar and large in quantity. But this remains to be provo4. The company, however,have two stringato their bow, iad dono* intend to confine their quartz-crushing to Vrginia,. ores solely, but will also try the auriferc7a qunai. which is foued about Dolgelly, and generally.-roundth base of Snowdon. A few small specimens of these quartz, were shown at Frodsham,which are as rich ss t2ey are are, and which if found in large quantities wol& yield,. ib is calculated,1,500 ounces per ton. But, of oouxne, theso pieces. are enly curiosities for the cabinet of the mineralogiak Neverthelees it is thought that auriferora. quartumaw be found in North Wales at least a rich, if; not richer thax the ore from Virginia, which, of ourwe, could be lbrought to the works at Frodahain ailessthanh epricoe now paid for that from America This is by no means the first time Ctat attempte haysheen zaade to extract gold from the Welsh quartz, thoSgk, whether from mismanagement or iIte inbicsic poverty of the 3matrix, not one of the Echexe bhaa has yet poved re. munerative. No doubt whatevf, exists as tio awrifesre nature of the soil and rocks of Wicklow, and Iee some time the Government mining ener% was directed into Ahat chan. nel. The result was gold cOStinly, but gold at ihe rate of 5l. and 61. per oz. It u,u however, be rocollected thast at that time steaun macbinary wu unknown, and that at no time was our t3overnm,nt ever celebrated for the skiU or economY witA which they could eorupete against private speculatioD.

FOBEIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. [A portlon of the following appenred in our second edition of Rmtnrtrdv ~--- (FROM OUR OWVN CORRESPONDENT.) PARIS, FRIDAY, Ju;N 5, 6 p.mx. A private despatch from Constantinople announcea that the Porte had demanded of the Belgian Governnment the recall of its Minister. The Belgian Government has refused to comply with the demand. It is expected that before long there will be a suspension of diplomatic relations between the two Governmuents. The cause of the dissension is not mentioned. The telegraphic accounts received from the Danubian Provincos announce that the result of the elections in Moldavia will, as far as can be known at this moment, be unfavourable to the Unionist candidates. M. de Segur, Firat Secretary to the French Embassy at Constantinople, who is in Paris on leave of absence, is not to return toTurkey. He wrill probably be promoted to the rank of Minister in consequence of a vacancy created by the return of the Count de Morny from Russia. The first electeral circular has made its appear ance. It is from M. Debrotonne, lately Deputy for the Aisne,who,with the support of the Government, aaks for the votes of the electors In the arrondissement of Vervins. The whole pith of the address may be summed up in the following phrase taken from it :-" I have but little to say to you. It is now a very long time since we were known to each other." The review of infantry yesterday at Longehamps, although not so imposing as that of the cavalry one on Tuesday, excited sufficient interest to draw together a numerous assemblage of spectators. The -weather was delightful, and the heat was pleasantly tempered by a refreshing breeze. A little before 4 the troops began to take up their stations on the ground, and the effect was striking as the heads of the different regiments were seen debouching from the roads leading out of the wood. The troops consisted of the Infantry, Engineers, Gendannes, and Foot Artillery of the Imperial Guard. They were about 12,000 in number, under the Generals in command of the different brigades, and the whole under that of General Regnault de St. Jean d'Angely. On coming on the ground they formed into three lines, extending from the mill towards St. Cloud. Precisely at 5 the roil of the drums announced the arrival of the Emperor, who entered the ground attended bya brilliant, though not very numerous staff. Hlis Majesty wore the uniform of a General officer, with the Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honour. On his right was the King of Bavaria, who wore a light blue uniform, with the Grand Cordon of the same order. After the cortege came the Empress, accompanied byone of her ladies of honour, in an open caleche and four. After passing in front of the lines, the Emperor and his illustrious visitor took up their stations on the rising ground opposite the grand stand, and the troops were put through several evolutions. The skirts of the ground were lined with skirmishers; the infantry formed into hollor squares, the front ranks kneeling as if to receive the charge of cavalry; and the artillery took up a position, and unlimbered their guns, as if to prepare for an attack. While this was going On the 35mpress alighted at the stand, where a seat had been prepsred for her. In a short time after, the Emperor and the King of Bavaria dismounted and joined Her Maje3ty, with whom they remained conversing for about a quarter of an hour. Duringthe time the Imperial party remained in the stand the troops piled arms and took repose. The drumshaving again beatte arms, the Emperor and the King placed themselves in front of the stand for the filing off, which took place in admirable order, the various regiments marching at once off the ground to quarters. The cortdge then returned to St. Cloud. The Dgbats publishes some interesting statistics concerning the French population, from which we extract the following passages in reference to marriages and deaths:- "1 The maximum of marriages takes place in Febrary. and the miinimum in MIarch, the time of Lent. A slight diminution is likewise noticed in the harvest months The amount of education posse3sed by the married couples has, we regret to say, been ascertained only In 82 departments, and in 356,663 marrIages. Of this num ber, 170,172 husbands were able to sign their names, a, were 116,133 wives. The remainder of the husbands and wives, or nearly a third of the men, and more than half of the women, who married in 1853, could neither read nor write. Of the above marriages 34 took place between nephews and aunts; 107 between uncles and nieces; 629 between brotbers and sisters-in-law; 2,309 between Srst cousins. In 1853 834,177 deaths were registered, representing a diminution of 14,419 on the preceding year. The months of June and July, which are signalizedby the great. est number of births, xre also tho months when the fewes; deaths occnr. On the other hand, the month of March. when births are rare, is plentiful in deaths. Deaths ocour more often during the day than during the night. In towns the majority of deaths take place in the afternoon, and in the country during the morning hours." A private letter from Egypt announces that Lord Elgin had arrived at Cairo with his suite, and was to embark at Suez on the 5th of June on board the Surinam, which was placed at his disposal by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company, and sail directly for Singapore. The receipts of the Paris and Orleans Railway Company for the week ending the 27th May amount to 1,125,649f. 83c., being an increase of 72,985f. 1.0c. as compared with the corresponding week of last year. The receipts fromthe 1stJanuary tothe 27th May last amounted to 23,431,679f. 95c., being an increase of 4,371,620f. 62c. as compared with the correaponding period of the year 1856.

The preparations for the elections absorb public attention, and almost exclusively occupy the journalists who have not the fear of an " avertissemetnt" before their eyeas. The Memorial de la Loire asserted that a list of all the Government candidates would appear in the Moniteur of the 6th of June (this day), but such is not the case. The Count de Montalembert has addressed the foUowing letter, dated Paris, the 29th of May, to the editor of the Frarnche-om : "If I maintain my pretensions to be a candidate for the Doubs in 1857, It is because I believe that I have prcisely the same claims as in 1848, 1849. and 1852 to the votes of honest people, without distinction of town or country, my more than of priest or layman. I have abandoned none of the Drinciples or opinions which three times procured me the honour of representirng the independent electors of the Doubs, and I am consoious that I have not given any legitimate reason for a change of opinion with respect to myself." The menaces contained in M. Billault's circular against those who shall disturb public tranquillity by opposing the Government candidates appear to have produced their effect from the followring letter addressed to l'Ami de l'Ordre by M. Poriou, member of the Council-General of the Sommne, late representative and late Mayor of Amien, withdrawing from the canvas3. It is dated Aniens June 3:- " When I determined to present myself as a candidate for the repreesntation I trusted in the numerous proofs of sympathy which on so many occasions Ireceired from the electors who know and can appreciate me. Now that the electoral boundaries of Amien, are so greatly altered, and four new cantons are added to them, it would not suit mo to solict the votes of the electors who inhabit the extremity of the arrondissementof Abbeville. Imigh6, perhaCp, pride myself on the fact which causea me to retire. I leave the field free to the Government caudidate, and I sincerely thank those of my fellow-citirens who intended to vote for me." The Sitele contains the following:- "Are we to consider the department of the Maine-et. Loire .i placed beyond the common law? This might be beieved, for the ihd4pendant de l'Oues.t in its number of the 5th inst., affirms that it has been prohibited from writing about electoral buUetins ; that it has been officiaUy 'invited' to abstain from any observations that might resemble a censure, a blame, or even a praise of the fans. tionaries of the empire, finally, thaf it cannot interfere in the elections, as silence has been imposed upon it After the circular of the Minister of the Inutrior, and when similar prohibitions, dictated by excess of zeal have been everywhere withdrawn, the position to which the Inldep. dant de 'Oueet has been reduced is an anomaly which cannot last, and to which we now direct the attention of Government." Some of the best friends of the existing dynasty regret that the Emperor was not advised to suspend the operations of the decree which subjects newspapers to the consequences of an avertissement, and to permit the publication of electoral addresses Many persons are of opinion that if the Republicans were suffered to vote freely, as the Chartists are in England, they would be found to be a very insignificant minority in the country. The present repressive system gives thenm an exccuse for saying that, even with the moat numerous and best disciplined army that everwas ass;embled in and around Paris, the Government is afraid of them. The present qyatem of reaction further maintains the delusion under which many persons, particularly foreigners, labour, that were any accident tohappen to the Emperor the Republicans would rusih like a terrent over the city and carry death and destruction with them. M. Brifaut, member of the French Academy, expired yesterday morning at the age of 77. He was the author of the tragedies of Jane Grey (180), Ninus II. (1813), Charles de Navarre (1820), an opera named Olympie (1820), of which Spontini composed the music, and of several fugitive pieces of verse, none of any great merit. Among them were some stanzas in honour of the birth of the King of Rome, and a piece of verse in honour of the return of Louis XVIIL His last work was his reply to Count de Fallouxc at the reception of this latter as an Academician. Professor Carlo Matteuccl has just been elected a member of the French Institute. Heis Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Pisa, and succeeds Meltoem of Naples. The science of natural philosophy, and especially the electric branch of it, owes much to Italian genius, as the names of Volta, Galvani, and others prove. Professor Matteucci is well known in England among scientific men by his works on physiological and electric subjects, and also by his having received the Copley medal 12 years rgo.

A North German paper contains an interesting account of the reception of the Hungarian Protest ant deputations by their Majesties on the 6th of last month. When the Lutheran and Calvinist clergy rendered homage to the Emperor and Empress on the 5th they inquired whetherthe representatives of the "whole Evangelical Church" (cops EBangdicorum) would be permitted to pay their respects to Ilis Majesty. The reply was in the aflirmative, and at 2 o'clock on the following day the deputies of the different " Superintendencies " presented themselves at the palace, wherethey wereinformedby one of the Imperial Adjutantsthat they would have an opportunityof addressing the Empress as well as the Emperor. The spiritual and temporal chiefs of theLutheran confession were then introduced to the audience chamber, and afterthelapseof acoupleof minutestheirMajesties appeared. After some loud cheers one of the party advanced and delivered the following speech:. " Most illustrious Emperor and Apostolio King, most H. lustrious Empress and Queen, all the members of the Evangelical Augsburg Confession of Hungary, and of those parts (countries) which are legally united to it, do now, as loyal subjects, render homage and warmly welcome your Majesties through us their deputies. At present It is neither our intention to express our apprehensions nor to petition for the maintenance of the rights of our holy religion and of the sohools which are connected with the same. Our humble requests have already beeu laid at the foot of your Maajesty's throne, and with patienco and full confidence in your Majesty's grace we await your decision. It is our heartfelt wish to share in the festivities in honour of the presence of your Majesties in this countsy with unmixed joy, Christian harmony, and filial confidence. We bring no external splendour, but we bring a miulion of loyal hearts which glow (erglahem) for your Majesties, for their native country, and for their holy faith. We offer our heartfelt wishes for your wellbeing, and pray to Almighty God, the judge of all, to guide the steps of your Majesties, so that blessings and general content may accompany them. May your majestie, have opportunities of becoming acquainted with our circumstances and wishes, and with our constant fidelity to your persons and to Your illustrious House. We fervently pray that the Almighty may watch over the lives of your Majesties-which are precious to so many millions of loyal subjects-and permit you long to enjoy in your family circle the sweet pleasures of paternity and maternity. Such are the sentiments of our constituents, the members of the Evangelical Augsburg Confession, whom, with ourselves, we humbly recommend to the grace of your MAjesties."1 The reply of the Emperor was:- " I accept with heartfelt satisfaction and pleasure the homage and professions of respect and attachment of such a numerous deputation. I have always directed my atten tion to your ecclesiastical affairs, and will accelerate the wished-for solution of the question relative to your church." The short speech of His Majesty was received with enthusiastic cheers, and the deputation left the audience chamber with the permuasion that the rights and privileges of the Hungarian Protestants would not be infringed on. The deputation of the H elvetic Confession-the Calvinists-hiwhi was sub- kindly received as the Lutherans had been. Count Leo Thun, the Ministerfor Ecclesiastical Affairs and Public Instruction, was seen after summoned to restn, biut it is not known what instrUctionsjhe received. Some of the Paris correspondents have informed their employers that the pri=npal object of the King of Bavaria in going to Paris was to effect a reconciliation between the Western Powers and Naples, but the statement obtains little credit here. flis Bavarian Majesty is extremely desirous to have the question concerning the succession to the Greek throne settled, and he is probably endeavouring to persuade the Emperor of the French that it would be better for Europe at large if a Roman Catholic reigned in Greece on the demise of King Otho. Prince Adalbert of Bavaria refuses to change his religion, and it is by no means probable that the Princess, his wife, who is a Bourbon, will permit any children that she may have to be brought up in the Greek faith. It is generally stated that a rapprochement has recently taken place between Russia aud Austria, and there is some truth in the report, but you may be sure that the Emperor Francis Joseph will never become the satellite of tho Emperor Alexander. The French Government has recently acted as if it wished to force Austria to return to her alliance with Russia, but it is not likely to succeed. As long as Austria is on good terms with England she can hold hei; own against Russia, but she cannot enter into an intimate alliance with her powerful neighbour without being obliged " to eat humble pie," a dish which is not to her taste. There may soon be a reconciliation between the Rusian aud Austriau Courts, but many a lonig year is likely to elapse befor mutual confidence is restored. It is rumoured here that Russia is about to dismiss about 150,000 or 180,000 mni, but I know nothing positive on the subject. Hardly anything has been said in my correapondence of the journey of the Pope through his dominions, and the reason for my reserve was that the Au`trian official accounts,-and we have had none other-inspired me with little confidence. This morning, however, I hear that his Holiness has been everywhere perfectly well received by his subjects. As a matter of course, the authorities take those measures for inauring a good receptioa which are usualon the continent, but the personal appearance and bland mannera of the Sovereign Pontiff produce such a singularly favourable impression on aU classes of the people that a great deal of real enthusiasm has been displayed in al the towns through which his Hlohness has passed. According to private letters from Bologna the wealthy nobles of that city will display gret ma,gnifiicence durng the sojourn of their Sovereign among them, but they are resolved to tell him excactly how thinUs tan, and to prove to him that no country in l!urope is so miserably [ governed as the States of the Church. Cardinal Antoneli endeavoured to persuade his Hohness not to quit Rome, but for once Pius :X. was firm, aud expressed his resolution to see with his own eyes and hear with his own ears, tin uch positive terms, that the President of the CGouncil had no choice but to be silent. The day befoze yesterday the Emperor expressed his intention to continue his Hungarian journey, but yesterday his plans underwent a change, and it is now said that their Majesties will remain at Laxenburg until after the Maria-Theresa festivalon thel8th inst., and then go for two months to Iscel. In the evening of Monday, the 1st of June, the Archduke FrancisCharles anud the Archduchems Sophia (the parents of His MIajesty) retrned from Dresden and Prague to Vienna. On 'Change to-day there was a further dedine in all kinds of indusfrned stock and an unusual carcity of money. DENMARK AND GERMANY. The following note has been sent, addressed t HEZerr von Steffens, Prussian Charg6 d'Affaire at Copenhagen - "BERLIN, WAY 20. "The Courts of Berlin and Vlanna had, as you are aware, on several occasions pointed out to the Cabinet of Copenhagen how necessary it was, in the settlement of the subject connected with the constitution of the Duchies of Holsteln and Lauenburg, first and foremost to 'hear' the representations of the Etates with regard to those altera. tions of their former constitutions that have been odogy to them and, in this way afford them the possibiUty and an opporrunity of bringing forward their grievances and their Proposals. "To this end the proposal was nmade towads the close of last March that the Estates should be convoked as early was --sible for an extraordinary Diet. In reply to this pzoposal a despatch (copy of which is appended hereto) wa; communicated to us by Baron vonj Brookdorf, dated Copenhagen, 13th inst. "From this despatch we have learnt with satisfaction that the Government Of lis Majesty the King of Denmark after having accomplished ita reconstitution, has resolved to follow the courSe recomnmended to it, and we sincerely congratulate it on having adopted a measure that was caled for equay by its own interest and by the duties it owes to the Duchies and the German Confederation. " The Danish despatch oontains the promise that the provincial eatates of Holstein shall be convoked, atthe latest, in August of this year, and a revised draught of a constitution for the 'spacial affairse of the Dachy be submitted to them for due deliberation according to the forms of their constitution. It contains also the further promise that this draught to be submitted to them shall also containthose provisions which shall define the scope of the ' special affairs of the Dachy of Holstein. Finally, there was speciall the ex t.res3Inallthsur howeegrsi, antheeIothing attac as to how fregt thatnthedAssembl of the Estates should haivs ple oppor taity afforded them of expressing themselves freelyrad nhindered on the limits to bes put to the competence of the Estates. "In all this, however, there is nothing said as to hov 'ar the Danish Government will be preparedi to meet the claims which the powmiss of 1851 and 18S52 entitle the Duchies and the Confederationto make. On this bint we must wvait for the results of the approaching deliberations of the Estates, and although in respect to it we confidentlyeieckon on the wisdom and justice of His MIajesty the Kiing of Den. marlc,all the rights must of courss 'ce reserved and vindicated which alow out from the constitution of the Dachies. and from the undertakings entered into by the Crown of Denmark with Pruesaiand Austria in the years 1B51 and 1852. " If, however, the opportunity bo afforded to the Estatos, conformably to the promise made, of speaking out their sentiments as to their rights and claims, and duly to bring forward their grievances and require. ments, an Tpproprite basis will thereby be obtained for the fhrt er treatment of the matter, and in this way a suitable advance wiU have been made towards the settlement of the constitution question, on which the Cabinets of Berlin and Vienna have felt themselves compelled to insist. "Under these circumstnces we, in common with the Court of Vienna, find ourselves at the present moment under no call to bring the matter before the German Diet. " It must be observed, however, that the Copenhagen despatch holds out an expectation of a draught to be submitted to the Estates of Boistein only in respeot of the 'special affairs' of the Dachy; of the constitution for the ' common affaiW of the Danish Monarchy there is no special mention made. We nevertheless consider ourselvee justified in a3suming that the Estates will be left at liberty, in addition to the promised permission to deliberate on the limits to be assigned to the competenoe of the Estates, also to bring forward their objections and proposals with reference to the position occupied by the Dnchies or their representatives in the ' entire monarchy constitution,' and to vindicate the rights that accrae to them from the promises made to them in 1852, not only with reference to the recon. struction of the special constitutions, but also to the manner in which the Duchies are fitted into the constitution of the 'entire monarchy.' For, on the one hand, it is beyond al doubt, as we bave frequently adduced, that it is the consti. tution of the common affairs of the monarchy' which most vitally affects the former constitution of the Dachy, and that, therefore, according to the terms of the constitu.- tion, and according to the assurances which have been given them, the Estates have a claim to be heard on the subject of these changes. On the other hand, it follows from this reciprocal relation between the con,stitution of the entire monarchy and the former constitution of the Duchies, and the alteration introduced by the entire monarchy constitution in the competence of the Estates, that any discussion as to the limits of the compe. tence of the Estates must necessarily involve the question of their relation to the entire monarohy constitution. " Finally, the despatch of the 13th inst, does not make any apecial mention of the Duchy of Lauenburg; we presDme this to have arisen from the circumstance that, as is currently understood, negotiations have been opened with the Estates of Iauenburg, for we believe we may look on it as beyond all qcCestion that the Government of His Majesty the King of neamark is prepared to recognize a no les amount of rights as resident in the Estates of Lauenburg than in those of Holstein. " You are empwered to communicate the contents of this deslatch to the Danish Government. Should our way of viewing the late overtures of the Danish Cabinet, contrarY to our hopes and expectations, not be in conformit, with its views and intentions, we sbould in that case venture to reckon on a further communication on the subject, and on the tenour of that it would depend how far we should, under those circumstances, feel ourselves in duty boeund to submit the matter to the German Con. federation. "From your last reports I observe that, in consequence of the change that had taken place in Ministerial arrange. meats in Copenhagen, you had not communicated to t'ee Danish Cabinet my iast desptch of the 10bh insta, in which I inormed you of the intention of the Courts of Ber. lin and Vienna to make a communication to the German Diet on this subject; you will, therefore, take an Opor tunity of brinng it confidenti to the knowledge ownf mlcneben, in ordSer that he May learn from it how firflly we abide by our hopes and expectations that the Govern ment of His Majesty the King of Denmark will not close its ear to our friendly counseL "MAIlTTEUFFEbL." SPAIN. (3mox oua ow connEsPoeDs.) MADRID, JuVN 1. The influences brought to bear to envenom the quarrel between Spain and Mexico are such as to render it by no means improbable that, unless England and France interpose their decided veto, hostilities will shortly break out. The doubtful creditors of the Republic-those, I mean, whose claims the Mexican GoTernment declares ill-foundel and urge Spainto submit torevision-leave no stone unturned to embitter matters. I by no means accuse the Spanish Government of seeking war, or of being determined to risk it, rather than admit a fair investigation of the claims which 4iWexico declares unjust, but if public opinion, excited and irritated by a portion of the press and by speeches in the Cortes, attains a certain force and violence, the Government can hardly help being to some oxtent influenced by it in the line of conduct they adopt; and the longer the queation is allowed to drag on the more dangerous become the mancouvres of the anti-Mexican agitators, the greater the irritation and ill feeling, and the more powerful the preaure on the Cabinet. Unfortuately, the course adopted by this Government is preciaely the one best calcu. latedto protract the settlement of the difficulty. The cause of quarrel is the murder of some Spanish aut - ject, te il-teatentandroberyof others ; and theseoutrages arealeged tohavebeenconmitt-t leastinpart-bythetroopsorarmed bands of Alvarez. Now, if the question were limited to this it might perhaps beeasily settled. The Spanish Government demands the punisbment of the offenders and comn pensation for t e injured. The first point Mexico at once concedes-not within eight days, as was arrogantly and imprudently demanded by Senor Sorela, but within such reasonable period as maybe needed for investigation and for the action of the tribunals. Upon the result of such investigation must depend the question of compensation. If it be proved that Mweaican troops or Government officials are the authors of the excesses complained of, Mexico, as T am positively informed, admits that there is a claim for compensation. Btit if, on the contrary, it is shown that the crimes have been perpetrated by lawless ruffians and marauders, not in Government pay or employ, there is nothing in the law of nations to entitle Spain to insist on eompensation for her injured subjects. It is e6rtai:Xy deplorable that, owing to the weakness of the Executive, or other causes, such outrages should have been perpetrated, and such bands of ruffians be suffered to infest the land, but foreigners resident there must take the consequences of the situation, and not expect a compensation which Mexican subjects would have no right to claim. But; besides the question of the SanVicente andCuernavacaoutrages,theSpaishGo.vermentbringnforward all its other claims and causes of complaint ac-ainst Mexico, aad demands thei r settlementbefore diplornatic relations sbll be resumed. This is, to say the least, an unwise course. The plain and prudent one woud be,frst to settle the most irritating point in dispute, that out of which the rupt-re of diplomatic intercourse arose, and then, when the present heat should be allayed, and Senor Lafragua, now here as a negotiator (that is to Bay, in an officious rather than an official character), should have been recognized as the Mexican Minister Plenipotentiary, the older questions in dispute might be discussed, and, with temper, mnoderation, and fair play on both sides, might, doubtless, be amicably adjusted. This, however, is not the view taken by the Spanish Government, which insists on lumping its grievances, and) pending their settlement, makes warlike preparations, and suffers the press and Opposition orators, sirred by various, and, there is reason to fear, in some cases, discreditable and unpatriotic incitements, to rouse a feeling of hatred and hostility to Mexico, and bring Spain to the brink of a war. The tone of some of the Madrid papers is most irritating and intemperate. lItheir columns one finds the terms "Caribs," "barbarians," "savages," &c., daily applied to the Mexicans. With the censorship that exists such ofrensive terms could not be employed without the consent of the Government, and thenaturalinference (although, perhaps, not a strictly correct one) is, that it approves this aggravating course, and is not disinclined to the appeal to arms to which it may probably lead. The good offlces, strenuously exerted, of the English and French Ministers at Madrid, have as yet been without effect, and, as I have already informed you, matters are for the moment at a standstill, and the parties intereated await the arrival of the next mail from Mexico with the rather vague hope that it may bring something or other that will facilitate the settlement of the question. It may very possibly bring news of the condemnation, and perhaps of the punishment, of some of the persons guilty of outrages on Spanish subjects; but it cannot be expected to bring the solution of the question of compensation, of that of the claims of Spanish creditors, and of the various other matters which Spain has thought proper to associate in her demands for satisfaction. The Co-respondencia A'utografa, said to be semiofficial, contains the following paragraph:- "Persons who appear to know the thoughts of the Minister of Finance assure us that the inferences that have been drawn in favour of the special recognition of the coupons known as those of the Committee, from Senor Barzanallana's last speech, are very hasty or uncertain (aventuradas). Senor Barzanallana thinks, as we are in' formed, that the time has arrived to put an end, by a gene' ral legilative measure, to the ineidents that have been pro' duced by the law of 1851 for the arrangement of tho debt' As a consequence of this idea there may be expected a gene' ral solution'of all the pending questions of thiskind; but, as the Minister has not yet given form to his thought, nor the Government approved it, we think we may venture to saY that nothing positivecan be stated in this delicate matter." This is vague and ambiguous enough, and may mean a good deal or nothing at all. The admision that the coupon question is not definitively settled, and that it is to be considered in an approaching financial arrangement, ..would alone be very important, when we remember that the Spanish press and Spanish legislators have repeatedly declared that nothing should ever be done for these claims. It has, however, always been the opinion of' many persons that the day must comnewhen Spain, to revive her credit and open the pockets of English capitalists, must compound with the couponholders. As regards her own interests, I incline to think that this country never took a more unwise step than the repudiation of those coupons. It was a question of character and credit mbre than of money. Had she acted honestly, a long day would have been granted to her, and she would not have forfeited so completely as she did by that act the sympathy and confidence of the British public. Some day she wrill probably find herself compelled to retrace her stepbut whether tl;at day is-near at hand or not I am unable to decide. Something may perhaps depend on the degree of readiness with which the remaining instahuents of the Mires loan shall be paid. The Spanish Government may find itself so pushed as to be compelled to take some step to raise its credit. There are persons who think it is sufficiently strong in the Cortes to carry through a measure for the recognition of the coupons. This may perhaps be the case, but a more unpopular measure could hardly be brought forward; and the Government might perhaps, rather than encounter a strong opposition and damaging discussion, prefer to 'wait till the session is over than settle the matter by decree, and trust to an easier approval of the fait acCompli when the Chambers should again meet. There are other reasons for supposing that Ministers would prefer this latter course. At present, however, we are reduced to conjectures, and the Government is extremely reserved upon the subject. Lord Howden yesterday gave a magnificent banquet to the Prince and Princess Galitzin. Thirty-five persons sat down to dinner. Marshal Narvaez was indisposed, and, at the last moment, fotind himself unable to be present. Senor Pidal, thb Marquis de Turgot; and other members of the Diplomatic Corps, Senor Isturitz (who is on the eve of departure for Russia), Seftor Gonzales Bravo, General Lemery (Captain-General of New Castile), and other persons of distinction, were present. The diliner was followed by an evening reception. This being a close holyday, the Chambers do not sit, and there is no Bolsa. ITALY. A letter from Rome, of the 26th ult., states that Monsignor Berardi has obeyed to the letter the in- structions of Cardinal Antonelli-that is, hes con- stantly near the person of the Pope, and prevents hiin from having any direct communication with those of his subjects who might respectfully explain to'him the truth as to the deplorable situation of the country. At Perugia, for instance, His Holiness was earnestly entreated by an inhabitant (his devoted adherent) to prolong his visit one day, arid the Pope consented, but Monsignor Berardi observed to HEis Holiness that if he did so the order of his journey would be altered. The Pope was forced to change his resolution. During his stay at Perugia Monsignor Berardi prevented the citizens from approaching His Holiness, and the 46 hours he remained there were spent in visiting the convents. The deputations from some municipalities were only suffered to approach the Pope to kiss his feet;they were not, permitted to speak. These deputations might have mentioned many facts which would astonish the Holy Father, and enlighten him on many points as to the system of government practised in his name. This is the explanation of the hasty manner in which the deputation from the municipalities were admitted into the Pope's presence. The municipal deputation from the city of Orvieto, with the Bishop at its head, solicited in vain the honour of a reception. They waited an entire day, and repeated their request, but without success. At length the following evening, after waitingthreehours, they were admitted when the Pope was retiring to remt. The meetingwasconsequently short, and wasconfined to an exchange of complments. The municipality of Perugia was admitted to the presence of the Pope at the last moment, and when they began to spek i wa anoucedtha hs crrigewas waitbig,andthedeptie wee frce towithdraw- without having executed their commission. The writer of the letter adds:- " Ai to the reception which the population in generat gave His Holiness, it was silent and respoctful but there was no demonstration of enthusiasm. They gratefully re. ceived the benediction of the Ponti£, but they showoed nj mark of affection for their Sovereign. It is to be hoped that Ins journey may prove to His Holiness that his Miniters have represented the stte of tho country in a false point of viev, and that he will do well to make the changes in the Government which are so much required." A letter from Turin of the 3d inst. announces that the Minister of the Interior has given orders that the body of the Protestant which was refused sepulture in the churchyard of Fara shall be disinterred and buried in consecrated ground. The students of the University of Parma, in conjunction with those of Piacenz$, have forwarded 426f. 86c. to the Mnister of Finance at Turin to be added to the subscriptions sent by other Ita1ian students in aid of the purchase of 100 guns for the fortress of Alessandri. They hope that the following inscription will be placed on one of the guns, "The Italian students."
LOAD ELGIlzS MISSION TO CHINA. TO THE EDITOR' OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Ihave often heard the question put in a wie and I-could-tell-you kind of style, " What is Lord E3gin going to do ' but I have never yet seen any practical suggestion offered which could be of use to that nobleman, were he inclined to seek advice in carrying out the difficult and delicate duty with which he his been chared. Having been many years resident in China, and being naturally anxious that correct views should be taken upon this very important subject, I shall be obliged if you will aocept a few remarks in relation to it, which I offer not so much as my individual opinion as what I believe to be the sentiments of every one who has had long experienoe in China, and has given himself the trouble of tbinking what Is needed to ameliorate our position there. Let uafollow Lord Elgin in imagination to Hongkong, on arrival at which he will for the Airst time espy the Celestial shores and take in hand the tangled knot he ha got to unravel. He Will find matters probably in much the same condition as the maih have reported of late. Sir John Bowring will be at Hongkong, big with all kinds of plans for settling the difficulty, and itching to put them into execution in his own way, but prudently awaiting farther instructions. Admiral Sir Michael Seymourwizl be at Hongkong, too, his flagship and a few other sail anchored there for the protection of the colony, and the remainder, acme craising after pirates and mandarin juhks, and others lying at intervals up the Canton river, watching the enemy, and hiving to keep a sharp look-out for their own safety. Commi ioner Yelt will be at Canton chuckling over the laurels he has gained, but quietly maldng extensive preparations in the event of the brbarian English returning to the charge. The northern ports, Amoy, Poochow-foo. Wingpo, and Shanghaf, will be perfectly quiet, the respective trade of each progressing as sual, although thousands of theirinhabitants, hitherto feadul of rousingBritlshwrath, will be emboldened by the apparently unrevenged success of the City of Rams to indulge their ill-concealed pique apinst the foreigner. At Pekin, the true source of all the outrages Englnd and her citizens have suffered sinoe the treaty, the Supreme Government will be quietly watching the turn of events, fully approving all Yeh has done, yet quite prepared, should it prove that he has committed the Crown, to get over the difficulty with their usual astuteness, and without departing one iota from the exclusive, the repellent policy they have hitherto pursued. And last, but notleast, there are the rebels, who, when Lord Elgin arrives, will have entire dominance over one fifth of the empire, and that the richest and most populous; but what their policy or intentions are in relation to this new quarrel we cannot at present conjecture. And what is Lord Elgin to do under these circumsthnces, with one portion of this Chinese nation amicably trading with us and the other furiously opposed to us, and both equally supported by the supreme authority? I will suggest in the first place whathe ought not to do. He should avoid opening negotiations with Yeh, or taking notice of him in any way, not even so far as to report his own appointmeat by arrival. Were he to do so Yeh would inevitably insul him or treat his advance with silence. A mission to the Peiho and application for an interview with commissioners there would be equally imprudent. The parties sent would be ordered back, with an intimation that no communication could be had with the Court or its emissaries but through the commissioneratCanton,-the veryman wehavea quarrel with. For Lord Elgin to go in person to the Peiho, acoom. panied with a naval and military force, would bo equaUy resultless, for only the smallest sized vessels can navigate the river, and then only asfar as Teentsin,whiletroops ould not be transported to Pe;in without unheard-of-difficulties, and when arrived there, if notsuocessElUyopposed, would have the effect of driving the Emperor to his Tartar fastnesses. I will next suggest whatLord Elgin should do. Heought to wait quietly at Hongkong until sufficient of his arma ment shaU have arrived, whichwouldb--say, aboutAugust. The intermediate time he might employ in gaining as much information as possible from the foreiga residents, official and mercantile, the latter more especially, and in taking measures for the better security of residents at the northern ports, as a precaution against any breakout there. When all is ready he should, without a word or sign, move upon Canton and take it by a coup de main, housing his troops and stores in the numerous eligible and healthy Government buildings with which the city abounds. The city might then be placed under a military magistracy, and the Sappers and Engineers set to work to open convenient thoroughfares, improve the drainage, and make a number of other sanitary reforms which would fit the place for a year or two's occupation. Having establishedhimself in Canton, Lord Elgin shoula publish proclamations all over the city and neighbourhood setting forth the occasion of so heavy a penalty falling on its people, the objects of the occupation, and his determination to retain his position until he could by negotiation attain all he had come out to effect. Copies of this document should also be sent to all the Consuls, with strict orders to see them publishedthroughout their several districts. This done, the rest of his course would be comparatively easy. Commissioners would probably be despatched from Pekin to treat, or they would be ready to meet Lord Elgin there, if he chosa to go so far, which, of course, would be the more effectual plan. He would gain admittance to Pekin, obtain an audience of the Emperor, and return a successful diplomatist, having gained all his ends without disturbing any of the ports bat that one which by universal consent deserves oastigation. There are many points connected with the details of Lord Elgin's negotiations on which I will not enter. These must depend on his instructions and the demands he concludes to make after arrival there. If he secures entire freedom of access for British subjects to the interior of China, aud, retaining the five ports or increasing their number for judicial and revenue purposes, obtains permission for British goods and ships to go to any part of the coast or rivers, he will do well; if he come short of this, no treaty he can rmake will be better than the present. How he is to meet the rebel element is a point he alone can decide. We want more information before we can treat this question with safety. Of one thing he should be most careful, and that is not to press the present dynasty so hard as to hurry its downfall, since that will be folowed by such a state of anarehy and confusion as will deatroy China altogother, and with it, of course. our thrivine trade YOUNG OATHAY.

TO THE EDITOB OF THEJ TIME&S Sir,-There is an important error in your report of my speeoh l1t evening, which, as it involves a matter of fact, I am compelled to notice. In speaking of the amount of the Danish transit duties I said that the whole revonue collected by the Danish Government from this source had amounted to about 22,0004 per annum. If we reduce that by 4-5ths we arrive at the sum of 4,400L, and, even if the traffic upon the different lines double itself in fture, Denmark cannot expeet to derive much more than 9,0001. a-year under the new arrangement from this restrictive impost upon trade.

DONNHfl. gBefore the LoRD CHANCELLOR anld Che LQRDs JUsTIozS .f APPAALT This part-heard appeal from a decree of tho Master of the Molls was this moraing resumed. The object of the suit was to set aside certain deeds executed by the plaintiff, whereby he conveyed to the defendant, a solicitor, a rever. s'onaryinterest in certain propertysituate nearSearborough. The grounds of complaint, on behalf of the plaintiff, were that at the time of the sale ho was without any professional assi-tance other than that of the defendant, and that the consideration was inadequate. For the defeidaut it was contended that the sale was not that of a revenionary interest, for the plaintif had first mortgaged his property and then sold the equity of redemption, being unable to pay the interest on hts mortgage. Moreover, it was alleged that the markot value had been given. The questions mainly depended upon the evidence, and were of no interest to the general reader. The Master of the Rolls ordered the deeds to be set aside upon payment to the defendant of the money actually advanced by him, and left each party to a his own costs. From this decision the defendant appealer. The plaintiff alo complained that the Court below had not given him the costs of the suit. Mr. IL Palmner and Mr. Lewirn appeared for the appellant; Mr. Lloyd and Mr. C. Barber for the plaintiff.

VICE-CHANCELLORS' COURTS, Ju. 6. WILCOX V. SAMrr- V-$cfore Vic - a2icedlor Sir R. T. KlhNDERSLEY.) This ease was argued on the 23d of May and fully reported in The Times. It involves a niost important ques. tion npon the Sacces sion Daty Aet, and comes on upon the petition of the Attorney-General to obtain payment of the Cuty. The petition stated that William Wilcox, by his wil dated the 3d of June, 1826, directed payment of his debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, and gave aU his estates at Brandon, Walston, and Stretton-upon-Dan8more, in Warwickshire, to Richard Smith, William Wall Brown, and Thomas Brown, their heirs and assigns, upon trust to receive the rents and pay so much, not exceeding 1501., for the maintenance and clothing of his son, William Wilcox, sntil he should attain the age of 25, with remainder to the said William Wilcox for life, without impeachment of waste, wi th remainder to trustees to preserve contingent reiiainders, with remainder (whether the said William Wilcox abould have attaine d the age of 25 or afterwards) to the Erst and other sons of the said William Wilcox in tail :male, with the ultimate lim itation to the testator's own right heirs. The testator died in May, 1827, leaving his ron WiUiam Wilcox, his heir-at-law, him surviving. The estates consisted of certain messuages and 1,100 acres of land, of the v alue of 3,0001. per annum. A suit was instituted to admia ister the estate of the testator, and areceiver vas appointed, and William Wilcox took pessession, and died on the 18th of July, 1853, Chprles Walford Wilcox, his eldest son and heir-at-law him surviving, who thereby became tenant in tail in possession of the estates under the dliipositions in the will of the testator William Wilcox, and entitled;to 8391. 9s. 4d. Bank Annuities, representing part of the land which had been taken by the London and Bir.ningham BdilwAy Company. The petition then stated that, by the Act of Parliament in force at the time of the death of the tenant for life, William Wilcox, and thence to the present time, in respect of the duty payable on successions to real and personal property, there was payable to the Crown in respect of the succession of Charles Walford Wilcox to the said estates, under the disposition thereof made by the will of William Wilcox, according to the value to be ascertained in tbe manner directed by the Act, 1. per cent., by eight clear balf-yearly payments, an the petition prayed that such duty might he ascertained and provision made for the payment out of the said estates The trustees being unable to obtain funds to pay the duty, arranged that this petition should be presented, on the undersSanding that if the opinion of theCourt should be adverse to the claim an appeal should be made to a superior tribunsal, if the Attorney and Solicitor General should so advise. The Act in question (1fith and 17th Victoria, chap. 51) in the second section enacts that " every past or future disposition of property. by reason whereof any person has or shaU become beneficially entitled to any property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any per. son dying after the time appointed for the commencement of this Act, either immediately or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originqUy or by way of suxbstitutive limitation, or any devolution by law of any beneficial interest in property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of this Act, to any other person in possession or expectancy, shall be deemed to have conferred or ennfer on the person entitled by reason of any such disDosition or devolution a 'succession,' and the term ' successor' shall denote the person so entitled, and the term 'predecessor' shall denote the settlor, disponor, testator, obligor, ancestor, or other person from whom the interest of the successor is or shall be derived." The 15th seotion enacted that, ' where at the time appointed for the commencement of this Act any reversionary property expectant on death shal be vested by alienation or other derivative title in any person other than the person who shall have been originally entitled thereto under any such disposition or devolution as is mentioned in the second section of this Act, then the person in whom the said property shall be so vested shall be chargeablewith daty in respect thereof as a succession at the same time and at the same rate as the person so originally entitled would have baen chargeable with if such alienation had been made or derivative title created; and where, after the time appointed for the commencement of this Act, any succession shall, b*ore the successor shall have become entitled thereto, or to the income thereof in possession, have become vested by alienation, or by any title not conferring a new succession, im any other person, then those duties payable in respect thereof shaU be paid at the same rate and time as the same would have been payable if no Euch alienation had beea made or derivative title created - and where the title to any successioa shaU have been acceierated by the surrender or extinction of any prior interestw, then the daty thereon shaU be payable at the same time and in the same manner as such duty would have been payable if no such acceleration had taken place.' The fifth section referred to the extinction of determinable charges ; the 12th, to the duties payable ; the 14th, to the duty on transmitted successions, and the 20th, to the time of payment. The Act bore date the 4th of Aug&st, 1853, but it was provided by the 54th section that it Fbould be taken to have come into operation on the 19th of May, 1853, and, inasmuch as William Wilcox, the son of the testator, died in July, 1853, that is between the period fixed for the commencement of the Act and the time of passing, the question arose whether his son, Charles Walford Wilcox, having then come into possession of the estates as tenant in tail, could be considered as beneficiaUy interested on the death of WiUiam Wilcox, his father, under the second section of the Act? The ATlroINEY.GENEtAL, Mr. A. HANSON, and Mr. TsuHING appearedin support of the petition, and said, that the question was, whether the case of a remainderman, under a will executed prior to May, 1853, feU within the Act. The Act was intended to impose a duty analogous to legacy duty on succession, under deeds or wiUs, the time ..xed for the commencement of the Act was the 19th of Llay, 1853, and that applied to all the existing wills and settlements-that is, such instruments the limitations under which were then in operation, the words " beneficiaDy interested" clearly meant " in possession." Suppose a settlement is dated in 1826, A being tenant for life, with remainder to B in tail, and the settlement exists when the Act commences, and A dies after the 19th of May, 185:, does not B succeed to A. The words "past disposition" extended to instrusnusts executed before the commencement of the Act. The third section referred to a joint tenancy, which was executing when the Act came into operation. This was a pena tute, and must he construed strictly ; it had been to much the custom to give general interpretations to these statutes. Mr. GLASSE and Mr. REILLY opposed the petition. This was an experiment in litigation. The Act was obscurely and ambiguously worded. ' Beneficial" did not n6cessAfil mean in possession, and therefore Charles Walford Wilcox did not become beneficially interested on the death of a person dying after the time appointed for the commence. mnent of this Act, for he became so beneficialy interested immnediattely the will Of William Wilcox, the testator, took effeot in 1826. It was plain that in posession wa not meant, for in a subsequent part was the word "expectancy," -and the words income " and " property " were not tited in contradistinction. The word "imnmediately" was the only word which might import "possession ;" but'that coald not be so, because it was only used as contrasted Wvith the word "interval." The ATroRNEY-GENERAL was heard in reply. The authorities cited, were:-16 and 17 Victoria, c. 51, s. 2, 3, 5,12, 14, 15, 20, 44. and 54; "In re Micklethwvit," 1I Excb.. 452 (25 L. J., 19); " Wilton v.

Johnstone," 3 Taunt., ;77; "Dwarris," 8.35; "H obson v. Neale," 17 Beav. 185. It was understood tbat a great number of cases Were awaiting the decision of the present case. Judgment thavlag been reserved on the former occasion, The VICE-CHANCELLOR (after stating the facts) nowisaid that the question was whether, under the circuastailces, cuccession duty was payable. It was unquestion3ble that, us a general princ;ple, where Acts of Parliament imposed fiscal duties on the subject, they must be construed reasonably, and if they were ambiguous, the subject was' entitled to the benefit of the doubt; not merely where the in- genuity of counsel was able to show that the language might have been more clear to ahow the inteution of the Legislature, but where the judicial " mind" entertained a reasonable doubt as to such intention, and retained it after a careful examination and consideration, in such a case the Coirb was bound to give the subject the benelit of the doubt, although the inclination of opinion might be contrary to I such interpretation. There had been much minute criticism on this Act-almost hypercriticism-and that was not misapplied; for it was by reason only of such care that you could fully arrive at the meaning or solustion of the question whether there was such reasonable doubt. The Act re. ceived thelRoyal assent on the 4th of August, 1853, bat bythe 54th section it was to be taken to have come into operatibn on the 19th of May, 1853, and to take effect accordingly. The general power of the Act seemed to his Honour to be this :-The second and several subsequent sections enacted, that the acquisition of an interest in property in certain specified ways and under certain specified circumstancei should be held to constitute what was implied by the technical term "succession." By the 10th section every succession was made liable to duty; the question therefore was whether Charles Walford Wilcox acquired an interest in such a way, and under such circumstances, as to constitute a succession within the meaning of the Act. The principal and leading section of the Act which had given rise to most comment was the second. That section comprised two branches, one relating to cases of dispositions, the other devolutions of property by operation of law, which latter branch, however, it was unnecessary to consider, becausethisacqui. sition at all events was under a disposition. (Iis Honour read the 6frst portion of the section.) It might be useful to clear the way to the interpretation of this section by stating what he considered the sense of some particular words and expressions in it. "Past" meant previous to the passing of the Act; "future," subsequent to such passing; and the language must be considered as speaking at the time the Act passed although its operation might be postponed. It was said that the word "past" meant previous to! the passing, hut net at any period however remote, but betweeu the time appointed for the commencement and the time of passing; in other words, thero must be a limitation to the word "past ;" unless there were strong grounds for that the Court had no right to impose such limitation ; it meant at any time, however remote, previously to the passing of the Act. So the words "have or shall" referred to the same time. Then came the word " entitled," which meant having some right or title: but the words were " become entitled." What, then, was the meaning of the word "become?" According to Dr. Johnson's definition it was "to enter into come state or condition by a change from some other ," therefore it meant to acquire a right or title to property In the case of "Blythe v. Granville" (13 Sim., 135); the Vice-Chancellor of England justly observed that it might mean in possession or reversion, and a reraainder man might become entitled in possession, although previously he was only entitled in remainder by a change from the otber state or condition. The word "beneficial" meant being entitled in his own right in contradistinction from being entitled in remainder. Then came the additional expres. sion, "to any property or the income thereof upon the death of any person dying after the time, &o." What did that mean? Suppose a person devised an estate, upon the death of his father, to A for life remainder, to B in fee; B became entitled to the estate in remainder, hoehad become entitled, expectant upon the death of a person, which eveni had not yet happened, but it might mean actually in possession; beyondall doubt, it was ambiguous, the words' here being, after the time appointed for the commencemeat of this Act ;" and in the 64th section "come into operation ;" and he (the Vice.Chancellor) knew of no inore fertile source of controversy than using different language in differentl parts to express the same thing although here it was not suggested that there wad any different meaning. It was contended by the respoxident that inasmuoh as Charles Walford Wilcox was born 'at a period between the death of the testator and when the Act came into operation, immediately on his birth he became entitled to the property; no doubt, that was true, butt not in possession until his father's death, which happened in the interval between the time the Act came into opeortion and the passing, and therefore it was said, inasmuch as he became beneficially entitled as remainder-man, not on the death, the case was not witbin this section. On the other hand, the Crown contended that the words "have or shal," ho., meant " expectant on the deatb," and it was clear that there was considerable ambigtity ; and, although his Honour thought, on the whole Act, that it meant " become entitled An any way whatever," yet, on looking through it, the scheme seemed to be to treat a person as having become entitled in " succession" although not in "possession;" and several sections spoke of it in that light. The 20th section referred to the " duty imposed at the time when a successor or any personin hisright should become entitled in possession;" and in one sense Charles Walford Wilcox came within that. Suppose the words were " have become beneficialy entitled expectant on the death of any person." At the time of the passing of the Act he had an interest expectant on his father dying after the time appointed, &c. i but the word " expectant" was there interpolated, and it was justly said by the respondent in the other section, where the word was intended to be imported, it was used. In the 14th was the word '"possession," and in the 15th was the -word `expectant." If the respondent's contention was right we should have this very inconsistent result-this case must exist:-Sappose a testator made hip will after the Act, 10 years hence, and devised to A for life, remainder to his first and other eons in tail. Suppose A, when the testator died, had a ison, immediately on the testator's death A would become entitled for life in possession, and the son; if born, would be entitled to the estate in remainder, and then, even on the respondent's own contention, the son would be entitled on the death; but suppose an exactly similar case, except there being no son born when the testator died, but after; then he would be entitled on his birth, but not on the death of the testator, beqause he was not then born, nor on the death of his father,; be. cause he became entitled on his birth ; so that, supposing all this was after the Act, the question of liability of the 9sn to pay duty vould depend upon his being born after or before the testtor's death. and that was so unreasonable that his Honour would hesitate before saying that the respondent's eontention was a sound one. The words "past"- and " future" were doubtful, but it was unnecessary to try the case upon that, because this section was a string of altqrnatives, and it was competent to take any set for the purpose of argument, and therefare, taking it thus,-" every past disposition of property by reason whereof any person has become beneficially entitled to income on the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of this Act shaU be deemed to have conferred a succession," the Crown had a rht so to read it. Did this case, then, come withipi it? Was it Pastl It was. Ead the respondent becomq entitled? He had; not to the income during the father's, life, but when he died, and therefore after the commence. ment of the Act; it was therefcro within this alternative. There were several sections which applied to coases clearly within them, of such a nature that, comparing them ,with this case, it was impossible to suppose that the Legislature intended to embrace those and not this; it was, perhaps, not conclusive, but it was a valeat quan tun The 3id section applied to joint tenants in possession, and therefore antecedent to the Act. That was an analogous case. The 5th section was of the same nature, and the 6th, and these were illustiations; but the 15th afforded a stronger 4rgument, for it made reversionary pro erty which was aliened liable to duty; and suppose that tharles Walford Wilcox had attained 21, and had aliened his remainder in fee vhen the Act passed, the alienee was liable to the same duty as if no alienation had taken p]ace; assuming that in such a case, if there had been no alienation, the remaindeirnan would have been liable. Although that was not conclusive, yet, finding that this case came within the language of the 2d section in one series of alternatives, and upon th4 sections referred to, and having fully considered the matter, and fairly taxed his mind to discover whether he entertained any reasonable doubt, he (the Vice-Chancellor) was hound to say that he did not ; otherwise he would have given the subject the benefit of it. The claim of the Crown, therefore, must be allowed, and there must be an inquiry aa to the amount of duty. The costs were not pressed for b± the FARLEY V. TVURER. This case came on upon an adjourned summons from chambers, upon the question whether a sum of 5001. belonged to the creditors of the testator in the cause or to a person named Goodwin, under these circumatanceL Goodwin was a customer of Messrs. Farley, Jones, and Co bankers, of Eidderminster, and on the 9th of Deceniber 1856, having a balance in their hands of 942t, on the 10th he paid in 7071., and on the 11th, 2151 and gav the following instructioni, in writig, to them, by heir clerk Klddermlnster, Dee. iO, Itie Mess' Farls*.

The advice vwas forwarded immediately, with instructions to brokers, Messrs. Overend and Gurney, to pay the 5007. by bills to Robarts and Co., which was done; but on the same day Messrs. Robarts had intelligence of the death of Mr. Turner, one of the_ firm of Farley, Turner, and Jones. which toos place on the 11th, and paid the money subsequently to his personal representative. It appeared that the 7071, was carried to Sr. Goodwin's general banking account, but'that he gave to the clerk when he paid it in specific directions as to what he paid it in for, and these were acted upon as ahove, and the question was whether the 5001. belonged to Mr. Goodwvin or the general creditors MIr. Baily and hIr. Elderton appeared in support of Mr Goodwin's claim ; Mr. Glasse and Mr. Ed for the creditors of 3Ir. TMrner, The VICE.CIANCELLOB thought that this sumn of 5001. was so made the subject of specific instructions, although not positively earmarked otherwise; that the fihm of Farley and Co. were bound by it (the act of their elerk binding them), eud therefore it did not belong to the general creditors, not intextering with the general principle that money paid in to a banker's was not so identified as that you could receive back the identical thing deposited.

COURT OF OTTRrWR RFitr.N - T1T7P O1ThVRN V Ti.7t^.^ _ (iangs in Ban-o, b,efo LodCj j'--* - -- .- COLEREDGM. ERTLL ~,A % This was a rale to quash a convti ton iunder the 30th section of the Game Act, the 1st and 2d of William IV oap. 300 Tiw queation arose out of the caw of "Iwtenfo v. Swikfen," tried at Stafford at the spring assiu_I856,_in which the title to estates of considerable value in th county of Stafford came in question. At the trial a compromise was come to by the counsel for the parties, which Mrs. Swirifen, who was in possession of the estate, refused to ratify, and ultimately it was decided by the Court of Coma. mon Pleas that the agreement was not binding upon Mrs. Swinfen, and the Court refused to enforce it. On the 29th of September, 1856, the day on which the claimant, Cap. tain Sivenfen, would have been entitled to have the estate conveyed to him, he gave an authority to a farmer on the estate named Bacon, or any of his friends, to shoot over the Swinfen estate; and Bacon, availing himself of this autho. rity, went, with six others, on two several occasions; and killed geme, destroying, as alleged by the other side, all the game on the estate, including tame pheasants. The parties were summoned before the magistrates at Lichfield, and were convicted; but the convictions were subsequently brought up into this court in order to their being quashed, as being made without jurisdiction, and being ba on their face. It was stated in the defendants' affidavits that they had apphed to the justices to have the hearing adjournel and that they proposed to give in evidence that they had the authority of the owner of the estate for what they had done, it being provided by the statute that-" Anv person charged with any such trespass shall be at lierty to prove, by way of defence, any matter which would have been a defence to an action at law for any such trespass." The authority reled upon was in the following form:- "Sw-infen Fam Sept. 29, 1se. I authorize Mfr. Bacon or any of his risands to ascot over ic.y estate of Swinfen until I make further arran=emeuts relative to she shooUng. `F. EL SWINFJN, Captain Sth Dragoon Guirds." It was said the magistrates refused the aplication, saying that the defendants were a parcel of blackuards and that day-poaching ought to be put down. On the other hand, it was distinctly denied that the maglstrates had refused to hear evidence, for that none had been tendered ; and, with respect to the language alleged to have been used by the maaistrates, it was stated that it was not used till after the business was over, and then only by one of the magistrates, and in reference to the proceedings of the defendants in destroying tame pheasants. The conviction set forth that on the 3d of N,ovember, 1856, at Lichfield, John Cridland, John Bannister, William Whilton, and Jonathan Sanders are convicted before two' of Her Majesty's justices of the peace for the county of Stafford, for that they, on the 13th day of October last, at the parish of Welford, in the said county, did unlawfully commit a certain trespass, by entering and being in the daytime of the same day upon a certain piece of lan&dcalled Swinfen-wood or Bog-wood, in the occupation of Patience Swinfen, in search and pursuit of game there, without the license of the owner of the land so trespassed upon, or of any person having the right of kdlling game upon the said land, or of any person having authority to license them to enter or be upon the said land, contrary to the statate, &c., and adjudged each of them to forfeitrand pay the sum of 21., to be applied according to law, and also to pay the proeecutor Robert Lester the sum of 4s. lld. each for his costs; and if the said several sums be not paid on or before the 10th day of November instant, it adjudged each of them " to be imprisoned in the Common Gaol, at Stafford, in the said county of Stafford, for the space of one month, unless the said several sunms, and the costs and charges of conveying each ef them, so making default to the said common gaol, shall be sooner paid"' Mr. C. R. KENNEDY and Mr. GRAY showed cause against the rule; which was supported by Mr. PASHLEY, Q.C, Lord CsAPBEL said he was of opinion that the convictiop was bad and must be quashed. The language of the conviction implied that " each " of the defendants was to be imprisoned until the penalty, &c., should have been paid by "e lL" Each is to be imprisoned in the common gaol for the space of one month " unless the said several sums and the costs and charges of convaying each of them so making defanlt to the said common gaol shall be sooner paid." Theplain grammatical construction of that was, that "each ' was tobe imprisoned till the penalty, &o,, of "all" was paid. The form of conviction usually ado pted pointed out that one should not be liable for the default of the other, but that form had been departed from in this case. It was unnecessary, therefore, to decide the other questions which had been raised, but he (Lord Campbell) must say that he did not think it was proper forthe justices, when there was laid before them a bond ffde claim of title, to proceed to a conviction. It was said no evidence was offered, but the claim of title was made, and made bond fIde, and where such a claim was set up as a defence the magis trates had no jurisdiction, and ought not to convict. The other judges expressed similar opinions, both in reference to the badness of the conviction and the duty of the justies to hear the defence of title when bond jfde set up. THE QUEEN V. BACON AND OTHERS. The deoison in this case followed the event of the previous case, THE QUEEN (ON TXHE PROSECUTION OF THE CORPORATION OF HEEREFORD) V. TULLY AND OTHERS. This was a apecial case for the opinion of the Coutt, and which raised the queation of the validity of a rate made by the Mayor and Town Council of Hereford on the 18th of December, 1855, upon certain houses occupied by the defendants, under "the Hereford Improvement Act; 185M" (the 17th of Victoria, chap. 31). The question turned chiefly on the construction of the 146th section of the local Act, which provided " that no person occupying any tenement not situate in or adjoining to any street now formed or hereafter to be formed witbin the city, and not subject immediately before the passing of this Act to the provisions of the recited Acts, &c., shal be rated for the purposes of this Act, except only to the city rate, and to that rate only to such extent and for such purposes as such person. would have been rated in respect of such lands or tenements if this Act had not been passed." The appellants claimed exemption under this section, the property in question being situated beyond the streets of the city and. beyond a' turn. pike or a turnpike road. The SOLICITOR-GENERAL (with whom was leMr. Cleave) was heard in support of the rate, and Mr. H HIt, Q,C., in Lord CAMPBELL sd he thought the appellantd were ertitled to exemption under the 146th section, and that the rate ought to be quashed. The decision was in accordance with justice, that a party should not be subjected to a burden when he derived no benefit from it. The other JuDGES were of the same opinion, Rate quashed. THEI QUEEN V. THE MAYOR AND ASSEESSORS oF ROCIESTER. This case came before the Court upon a demurrer to a return to a mandamus. The mandamus commanded the Mayor andassessors of Rochester to hold a court and to revise the burgess lists for the parish of Strood,[in Rochester. The questions raised were, first, whether the words of the 18th section of the Municipal Corporations Act (5 and 6 of William IV., cap. 76), which required the Mayor and assessors to hold a court for the purpose of revising the burgess hsts at some time between the 1st of October indusive and the 15th of October inclusive, were imperative, so that they could not lawfully hold such court at any other tine, or whether they were directory only; and secondly, whether the rosecutors ought not to have proceeded under the 7th of William IV. and the lst of Victoria, cap. 78. Mr. H. HILL, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Coleridge) was heard in support of the demurrer; Sir F. THESIGER (with whom was Mr. Petersdorff) in support of the return, Mr. BUDDLESTON appeared for the Mayor, who. sabmitted himself to the judgment of the Court. Lord CAMPBELL said that, as there were other cases in the paperraising similar questions, the Court would heat them all argued before deciding any. THE QUEEN V. GOODWIN. Mr. BRANDT moved for a rule calling upon James Goodwin to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed against him 'or a series of libels publihed by him reilecting on James ilirch and the other guardians of the West Derby Union in Liverpool. Tho libela were contained in letters written to the chairman and clerk to the board of guardians, and imputed to the board that they had allowed one of their number, James Birch, to take contracts for the supply of food, &c., for the workhouse, and that they had connived at his supplying provisions of an inferior auality. The guardians had on two occasions appointed adayfor the party to attend and prove his charges, but he had on both occasions refused to attend, but instead of so doing he had written other letters containing other charges of a like kind. Goodwin was A schoolmaster and an ihabitant of the union. Lord CAmPBELL said, the learned counsel might take a rule. (Sittings at NisA Prius, at Guildhall, before Mr. J.uice WIGHTS1AN and Comea Juries.) GROOM V. SANDERSON. Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Charnock were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. 7sf. Chambers and Mr. Dowdeswell for the defendant. The declarationinthis case allegedthat the defendant had fraudulently misrepresented the value of a certain beer. shop. It appeared from the statement of counsel and the evidence of the laintiffs witnesses that the plaintiff had formerlyicen butler in several families of distinction, his wife had abecn in service, and between them they had saved 600&. !hey took a publichouse in Hart-street, Grosvenor-square. The house was burnt down, but they received 4301. from the insurance-office. Being anxious to get into business again thev applied to the defendants Mr. Mark Sanderson, who is a brewer in Thames-street. Ho recommended one or two houses to them, and they eventually agreed to take a house called the Napoleon in North. street, Moorfields, the defendant representing that it was a frst-rate house, doing a large business. The price of the goodwill, furniture, and fixtures was 2001. Plaintiff took possession, but after a while found that he had been grossly deceived. There was no trade whatever attached to the house, as it had been shut for 18 months, although defendant represented it had only been closed for six. The trade did not amount to more than a barrel a-week, notwithstanding evary exertion of the plaintiff and his wife. They, however, kept the house open tiUl the 2ith of March. Plaintiff now soughSo recover what he had expended on the house, in addition to 1501. paid on account of the purchase-money, a bill of 50Q. having been given for the balance. For the defence it was denied that the representation reled on by the plaintiff had ever been made. Defendant stated that the house had formerly done a fair trade; and that an active and energetic person might make a good thing out of it. Soon after the houEe was taken defendant remarked that the Plaintiff was not exactly the man for it. Plaintiff was stili Uving in the house; he had sold 641. worth of the furniture and fixtures, and wa3 indebted to the defendant 221. for beer supplied. His LORDSHIP asked the jury to say vwhether the representation relied on by the plaintiff had been made? The jury found that the plaintiff had been induced to take the house by a representation which was false to the knowledge of the defendant. His LORDSHIP then suggested that, in order to atop furtber litigation, the parties should agree as to the amount of damages. After some discussion it was agreed that the verdict should be entered for 501., the bill for 501. to be given up to the plaintiff.

WILLIAkS V. SMIT. This, like the previous case, had been part heard ori the Friday. The question involved in it tarned upon, the enactment of the 1st section of the Mercantile Law Amuemdment Act, 1856, that writs of execution should not prei4dsoe the title to goods acquired by any person bond flde and for a valuable consideration provided that such person had not at the time he acquired such title notice that sUch writ, or any other writ by virtue of which the goods of sach owner maight be seized or attached, had been delivered to and remamed unexecatedin the hands of the sheriff. 'The question was whether that Act, which came into force on the 29th of July, 1856, applied to the case of a bond fle purchase of the goods of a person against whom a writ of it. fa. had been moged in the hands of the sheriff before the passng of the Act, wh sh purchase was mado after thd Act came into operation. The question was raised by an iiterpleader issue, tried before Mr. Justice Willes, in which the verdict was entered for the plaintiff; the purchaser of the goods. The LORD CHME BRox said that the executioncreditor at the time the Act was paEsed had a right, by virtue of the writ being lodged with the sheriff, to have the goods of the execution debtor for the satisfaction of his judgment, unless they were sold in market overt. The Coart never construed the language of an Act of Parliament as diyesting an existhng right, unless the words of the statuo qxpressly took it away. There were no words having that ozation in the statute in question, and the rule should tueefore be absolukte to enter the verdict for the defendant. Rule absolute, HOLLIS V. MARSHAlL. This was an action arising out of a contesed election for the office of commissoner under a local Act applying the Public Health Act to the town of Cheltenham. Bot4 the plaintiff and the defendant were candidates for the vcant commissioxership, the defendant and anothergentlemanr'ere elected to fill two vacancies in the Board, and the plaintiff and another candidate were unsuccessful. It was sibsequent to the election discovered that Mr. Marshall did not possess the qualication required by the Act, and, as that gentleman had taken part in a meeting of the commnissioners, his rival brought the resent action for therecovery of a penalty of 50X, imposed b'y the statute upon any person who should act as a commissioner without being dauly qualified, and he recovered a verdict. Sabsequently a rule ni3i was granted for a nonsuit or a now tral, on the ground that the plaintiff had not given a month's notice of action, as Tequired by the Act; and that he had not obtained the consent of the Attorney-General to sue for the penalty which by the statute is neessary, unless the plaintiff be a party grieved by the acting of the unqualified person. The SOLICITOR-GZUNEaAL showed canse against the rale. Mr. POWELL argupd in suppert of the rule. The COuRT intimated that they thought a disappointed candidate could not be considered a party grieved within the meaning of the Act bo as to be entitled to sue for the penalty; andl that the rule should be made absolute either for a new trial or in some other shape. Rule absolute. (fittings at Nizi Prius, at GuUZdhoU, before Mr. Baron CR?NELL and Common JTuries.) CLOUGH V. TRUEMAN. This was an action brought to recover a sum of 73 15s., alleged to be due to the plaintiff as the price of a horse. The defendant pleaded payment. hlr. Serjeant Balantine and tr. Petersdorff appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Doyle reproc sented the defendant. It appeared from the case in support of the defendant's plea that he was a metal broker, and, being in want ot a carriage horse, apphed to a person named Henderson, a veterinary surgeon, who said he knew of one which would suit him. They then went to the premises of the plaintiff, a borsedealer at Bayswater, where the defendant saw the horse in question, and agreed to purchase it for 731.1 s. The plaintiff said hewould send it to Henderson's stables, and the defendant was to give Henderson a check for the amor.nt when the auimal was delivered to him. The defendst.g ave'Henderson the check the next day, and received the hoYSC Henderson had, however, appropriated the check to his own use, and had only paid 301. to the plaintiff togethr with one of his own checks for 431. 15s. , which had.not been presented. The plaintiff, however, placed the 301. to ienderson's accomunt. Henderson had soon after become bankrupt, and the plaintiff had then applied to the defendant for payment. The plaintiff's case was that be had never authorized the defendant to pay Henderson as his agent, but that on the contrary he had sent a nute to Mr. Trueman with the horse, reqesting him to send a check by the bearer. That note had been delivered to Henderson, who had put it into his pocket, and had never given it to the defendant. The defendant had therefore given the check to Henderson at his own risk, aud the plaintiff was entitled to recover the value ofthehorse. The learned JUDGF, in summingup, said that, even if the plaintilfs letter had been delivered to the defendant by Henderson the defendant would have been fulyjustified in giving him the check. The horse had been sent to EHenderson's stables, and it was evident that hc had acted as the agent of both partes, and would therefore have an authority to receive money. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant,

He then selected stock amounting.to about 1,. and gave inatructions for its shipment, saying he would call on the following day and settle the account. He took away a satf and a pair of gloves with him as a sample, but nothing was seen of him till Friday, Nhen he was seen passng down Wood-street by one of Mes Pent and Co's. men, who showed him the goods, and on being aocosted as Mr. Jones, and asked when he was going to pay for the goods ho had selected, he'denied that he was,Mir.

BOW.STRErT.-Frederick Hildelbrand, a young mani described on the charge-sheet as " a dancer, of 1, Churcrh street, Waterloo-road," was charged before Mr. HEiety with amaulting a man named RowlAnd Whie who di at the hospil whaile the examinaion ef the prisoner was iproceeding. It appeared that Hildebrand was employed Sa an Ethiopan aereniaer at the conoert-room- of Evans's HoteL Covent-garden, and -wa returning to hi, home betwoedn 2 and 3 o'clock on the 20th of lat moRth (the morning After the Derby), when he got into some altercation with the deceaEed, who had just been turned out of Jessop'sWTine Soon in a state of intoxication. Blows were exchadged between them and White's jawbone was broken,; but whether by a biow, kick, or fall, the evidence failed td determine. There wa no disinterested witness as to the origin of the quarrel, but Mrs. Arthur, a ooffeehhop keeper, of 7, Wellington-street, Strand, and Iher daughter (a girl cf 15), botb. deposed that they saw Wite rising from the ground, bleedinr d -e. fully from the mouth. Mrs. Arthur caled |out -Poiie . and, addr. sIng the prisoner, uid " It's asame tostrike a man in thatway" upon which the latfersaid lie strackmo first." and walked towards Waterloo.brIdre followed by two women who were in his company. The witnesses also stated that Whito said " My jaw isbroklnhe kicked me on the jaw." They washed his mouth and attended to him, after which he was taken to uine's Colege Hosrpital. 1 Police-sergeant Cox, of the F division, deposed tha JIe Faw the deceased in thehospital on the 2d inst.. and beard him say that on the morning of tho 28th of May, about 2 o'clock, he left the White Hart publichouse in Catheii&estreet and crossed ever to Waterloo-bridge. In Wellin&to. street some one struck him a violent blow and. broke his jaw, andafter that he received two other blows andl wa&s klced in the chest. He admitted that he was not adher and said he did not know the mian who struck him and o'ould not identify hism. Theprisoner,vwhosemannerseemed inoffentiveenougls1said that he had beenfor 15 months in the employ of Mr. Green, of Evanss Hotel, as a negro raelodist and aancer. Aftez performing as usual on the Derby night, hewalked home with his wife, and was proceeding towards Waterleo-bride,1 ren a man (the deoestad) came up to him and said, " hIa; the - - do you mean by that r' at the s'ane timie knocking his (prisoner's) pipe out of his mouth, and giving him/ two violent blows on the chest, which would have diubled' oet men, but he, being a dancer, was very firmin the chet He prisoner) struCK the man back again in self-defenceF but neither kicked him nor knocked hitm down. Hoewascefsi the man was not down once, notwithstanding the evi4ence of the coffeeshop-keeper, who was also wrong in sayingithat he (prisoner) a two women in his company. The ther woman was the companion of the injured man. Mrs. Arthur repeated that both women walked awayith the prioner, and doubtless the tollkeeperatthebridge could speak to this fct. The prisoner proposed to call his wife as a witness, Jad it having transpired that the young woman referred to although passing as his wife, had never been really matriei to him, Mr. Hznyaw said her evidence would be admissible, although she could not have been examined if she had been legally his wife. fI The gir in question stated that her name was Jane Hicks, and that she was a pose plastique in the service of IMr. Nicholson, of the Coalhole Tavern, where she performed nightly. [t was her custom to go round afterwards for MIdebrand, and they usually walked home together from Evans's. The witRCes then confirmed the prisoner'a statement a to what pasd in Wellington-street on the morning of the 29th ult. ater ildebrandhad struck the man bnce or twioe in return the latter said, " That will do ; you know too much for me; yon may go home." He (prisoner) then took up his carpetbag and walked away with witness. She did not ob= r that the una --n drunk The prisoner wavs perfectly sober. The coffeehouse witnesses also did not consider that the injured man was drunk, but Inspector Mitchel said there could be no doubt on this point, for, besides the admission of White himself, the hospital surgeon said he was drunk when admitted. The man was known to the police as an habitual frequenter of publichouses and saloons, and had been oonstantly seen drunk at those places, The porter at Jessop's Saloon proved that White had been drunk and disorderly on the Derby night, and was put out of their place at about 2 o'clock in the morning for causing a disturbance. Inspector MIitchell deposed that in consequence of the seriousturn which White's iness had taken be took the prisoner into custody at Evans's Hotel on Friday night, sating the charge. Prisoner said, "1 am innocent'; he struck me first, and then I struckhim back. I strack him two or three times." Witness said, "He says that you kicked him." He replied " So help me God I did nott' Mr. Nicholson gave the prisoner an excellent character for sobriety of conduct and industry, and believed that he would asault no one unless under great urovocation., The young woman, whom he had always supposed to be his wife till that day, was also a very sedy well-conducted peri,on. A genuine man of colour, named Smith, the leader of the Ethiopian oorps at Evans', also gave prisoner a good~ charncter. It was genealy their lot to ewind aup the amusements - at Evans's, and this made them necesarily late but prisoner wass very sober, steady, inoffensive man. During the progess of the case a constable brought in the intelligence tha' White had just died at the liespitaL The young woman Hicks fainted and fellback, and' rwas taken out of court in sensible. ir. HiEriY said, an inquestwould of course be held upon the body, and the jury would determine whether the prisoner had resorted to more than necessary violenoe in defending himself from what certainly appeared to have been an unjustifiable attack. Meantime the prisoner must ind bail for his appearance on a future day, Bail was procured, and the prisoner was remanded for a week.

About 20 minutes past 2 o'clock this morning II was on duty in the Haymarket, when I saw the prisoner, and another man in company together. Believing the prisoner to be the man who had recently attempted to commit a burglary I sent for police-constable MurreLl, who knew the prisoner better than I did. As soon as Murrell and myself approached the prisonerand his companion they both mae oft. e foliowed, and the prisonerandlhis companion separated.

Constable Murrell came up and said, "That's the man," and took hold of one side of the prisoner whlle I laid hold of the otber. We walked with the prisone in that way until we came to James-street, in the dire-tion of the station-house. Ithere left the prisoner with Murrell while I went in search of the other man, who had escaped. I bad scarcely reached the Haymarket when I hearda the report of a pistol, and then some one cried out for adsance. I ran back, and found Murrell stiU holding thdpr sonerby the arm, with three orfour women about him. constable, Murrell, called out, "lay hold of him, for lod's sake; he hns shot me." I then saw the prisoner raist his right hand, and at the same moment I heard the report of tba pistol. I saw the smoke, but I did not at first see the pistol. I then seized hold of the prisoner, and after some time we succeeded in taking him to' the station-house. I searched the prisoner, and found uponihim a long bowie knife, with spring back, four round pebb] s to fit the pistol produced, a quantity of 'smal hot and cboper caps, a ramrod, twro boxes of lucifers, a nd about 11l. in money. The prisoner said nothing, and declined to s ake any statement.

Itold the ser.ant tbats the prisoner was the man. We ran after him, and wrhen we came up with him the sergeant told me to, 1 hold of him on one side. I caught hold of the prisoners right wrist, and we walked towards the Haymarket, where the sergeant left me. As soon as the sergeant had gone the prisoner said to me, " What does be want me for?' I said, " You had better ask him." The prisoner then deliberately put his hand into his left pocket, pulled out what I1 afterwards learnt was a pistol, an slhot me in the mouth.

This is the fifth present of a similar kind made by Her Majesty as a speocial mark of her Royal favour to this regiment, the rest having died at various periods. One, which had become very docile and trained to march before the regiment, died on its passage from the Crimea, since which time it had been replaced by another goat from Windsor Great Park, which also died a few weeks ago, and the present animal, which is perfectly white and two years old, is intended to replace it. On Friday two Russian steam yachts-the Veha and the Bakan-built by Messrs. Samuda, with machinery by ilavenhiUl and MiUler, passed down the river under steam and canvas, to test their capabilities before leaving for (lronstadt on Tuesday. Count Lacendorf, Lieutenant Pes. ehowroff, Lieutenant Skariateen, of the Russian navy, and a large party of gentlemeu accompanied the yachts in their trial trip. These vessels are intended for the sanme purposes as our Trinity yachts, attending the lighthouses, and beacons of the coast, for which use they are specialy designed. The results were most satisfactory, and when under steam the boats of each steamer (light cutters), fitted on Clifford's plan for lowering, were several times manned and let down quite free of the ships in a few seconds, without at aU slackening the speed, the Count Lacendorf and Lieutenant Skariateen being in one boat and Mr. Samudain the other. The party of riggers and smiths, upwards of 50, employed dace the arrival of the Agamemnon at Greenwich on Friday, in riveting the mooring chains and making her snug, were engaged incessantly thro ughout Friday night up to midday on Saturday, when they returned to Woolwich.

THB I:ROENSNGy SYSTEM. TO THE EDITOE OF TEIE iTtI Sir -t. Hardy has undertaken tO introduce a 'Bil into Parliament this week abolishing beerlmOses3. If he succeeds we shall return to the condi"tion in which we stood prior to 1S8O, and the beerdrinking population of England will be handed over once more to the tender mercies of the Great Brewing Monopoly. Our legislators don't drink beer themselves; indeed, many of thembelieve thatit is a wicked drink, that water is more wholesome both for body and soul, and thattherefore the fewer temptations there are to its consumption the better. Mr. Hardy's BiU is intended to reduce the number of these temptations, b) leaving it to the Great Brewing Monopoly to decide how many people shall sell beer to the millions, how strong and how pure it shaU be, and how much shall be paid to them per pot for it. Now, we, the beer-drinking classes, Protest againat this ultra-paternal care which Mr. Hardy is desirous of bestowing upon us by Act of Parliament; we desire that the beer, wine, and spirit trade shall be an open trade, subject to the same economical rules as other trades are, and we object strongly to any law which shaU enable a smaU class of opulent and powerful individuals to fatten upon the monopoly of an article which is consumed daily by every Englishman who lives by the work of his hands and the sweat of his brow. We do not deny that in many places beerhouses are disreputable dens, where thieves and poachers congregate and prostitutes ply their dismal trade. But the reason that they are worse than publichouses in these respects is very clear. The beerhouse. keeper is driven by law into an unequal competition with the publican; he is, in consequence, almost always in difficulties, and is compelled to eke out his legitimate profits by iUicit and culpable means. A publican sells wine, spirits, and beer-he may sell them at all hours of the night and day, save and except during certain hours on the Sabbath. A beerhousekeeper may sell beer alonehe is required to close his house every night at 10 30. His neighbour, the publican, can ways crush him by selling beer for a time at cost price, or nearly so, making his profits off the other a&ticles in which the law allows him and forbids his rival, the beerhousekeeper, to deaL The committee which reported in 1§54 recommended unanimously that the trade should be thrown entirely open, under certain restrictions calculated to insure order in its conduct and to augment the revenue; they wished the power of licensing and of refusing licenses to remain with the magistrates, who should, however, be " bound to issue them to every applicant of good character, on compliance with certain conditions, and on the payment of a certain sum." Mr. Hardy and his friends object that if such a reform were effected publichouses and intoxication would spread over the country like a pestilence, and disreputable individuals, careless of public morality, and only anxious to promote a quick draught of ale, porter, and gin,would intrude themselves among the present licensed victuallers, who are a blameless class, kept in perfect order by an active and impartial though unpaid magistracy, ever mindful of the sobriety of their customers, and consequently disregardful of their own interests, which would of course prompt them to sell as much of the article in which they deal as the public would buy. Mr. Hardy must be a very credulous man indeed if he believes that there is a single man in England, at the present moment,with 5s. in his pocket and an inclination to get drunk, who remains sober in consequence of a scarcity of publichouses and ginshops at which to effect his purpose, or of publicans willing to assist him in the operation as far as his money Will go; and he must be stil more credulous if he imagines that the great brewers and their publicans are guided in the conduct of their trade by any feeling save that which actuates all other trades and professions-self-interest. Does he really imagine that Sir Henry Meux and Co., or Messrs. Barclay and Perkins, or Meesrs. Buxton, Hanbury, and Co., would not gladly sell twice as much porter as they do every year, without being harassed at night by uncomfortable reflections as to the deteriorated morality of the cabmen in the vicinity of their taverns ? Would he not smile if Messrs. Fortnum and Mason were to refuse t'o supply him with a second 2,dt defoie gras, on the plea that it would give him the gout, or if his butcher, remarking the dangerously apoplectic condition of his footmen, were to remonstrate, with disinterested kindness, against the inordinate weekly consumption of meat in his family ? Yet this is what Mr. Hardy requires ui to do with regard to beer. He asks us to believe that the great brewers are aftrighted at the probable increase of beer drinking, if the beer trade should be thrown open-not on their own account, but on account of public sobriety ! The question of the superiority of publicans over beerhousekeepers as guardians of public morality and order is easily illustrated. The latter, unable from the crippled profits of their trade to pay a high rent, are confined to low neighbourhoods, where only a low class of house can thrive. Now when a great brewer has a tavern in a good neighbourhood to dispose of, he seeks for a respectable and steady man to conduct it, it being clearly his interest that it should be weU conducted; otherwise his respectable neighbours wiU not deal witb, and his influential neighbours wiU compel the attention of the police to it. But when the same great brewer has a house in a low neighbourhood to fitl he acts very differently. His customers being swell-mobs men and harlots, he selects as landlords some low fellow who is popular with those classes, and is likely to attract them to his bar. He protects his own interests by exacting from the man a deposit sufficient to insure him against any loss should the trade of the house not prosper; and he runs no risk of losing the licoense of the house because the magistrates always allow the proprietor (if he be a highly respectable and wealthy brewer) the chance of removing a tenant who has made himEelf too notorious to be tolerated any longer and of replacing him by another. The magistracy of England are, unhappily, imbued with the idea that these great brewers ought to enjoy as their birthright a vested interest in the ilur of the middle and lower classes. They will never consent to do aught which may diminish that vested interest. If a new man applies for a license in a neighbourhood occupied by Sir Charles Bung's and Messrs. Spiggots and Faucit's publichouses, they invariably refuse the applcation, stating that there are publichouses enough already, and that they see no reason why they should damage the property of two such wealthy firms by admitting a fresh competitor for the surrounding trade. It is in vain that the beer drinkers plead that the beer of the great monopolists in possession is very dear and very bad; the magistrates firmly decline to enter into any such details; they merely go upon the broad principle that there ought to be eso many publichouses to so many inhabitants, and that if the existing publichouses happen to be in the hands of the monopolists, so much the worse for the beer drinkers of the vicinity, who, at worst, have always that moral tap the parish pump to fall back upon. If, on the contrary, the population of a parish dwindles away, in consequenco of an extinct manufacture, or a mania for emigration, or local im- provements which have changed a beer-drinking into a wine-bibbing commnunity, the magistrates never think of adapting the number of publichouses to the diminished wants of the neighbours-for they are the property of highly respectable brewer e, with whose vested rights they vwould be grieved to interfere. Mr. Hardy and his friends threaten us with a state of things akin to Scotch intoxication if the trade be opened. They prophecy that every draper and every grocer will then take out a spirit license, and privily persuade our wives and daughters to drink giu and bitters when they are osten- sibly purchasing printed cottons and brown sugar. But this contingeny the Legislature can easily obviate, by stiplating that beer and spirit licenses shall only be entrusted to perSOns who engage in no other trade. Sir George Grey understands this subject thoroughly; he sees the iniquity of the existing state of things; he sees the absurdity of Mr. Hardy's Bill; and he well knows what ought to be done to promote public morality and to insuire justice So all partie-to the consumer as well as to the producer. But he is afraid of the political intluence of the great beer monopolistg. He shrinks from the trouble which legislation on the subject will occasion; he counts with dism4y the number of brewerswho sit in the Commnons, and the still greater number of brewerse nominess who back them. Unless the public wvith a long pull, a strong pull, and A pull altogether, .~binitter considerable pressure froma without, he will most certainly not move in the matter, and we, the working classes, shall continue to be drenched with bad and dear beer in order that our brewers may revel in a luxury unknown to any other cluss of Englishmen. I am. Sir, vour obedient servant. A THIRSTY SOUL
TO THE BDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your impression of the 28th ult. there appeared a letter giving a note appended to a sermon by the late Dr. Buckland "On the lRe-opening of Westminster Abbey,-' published in 1848. This noto would appear to be the authority for the views put forward by your previous correspondent " N. Bi," who refers the source of a copious spring of water, reported to have been discovered at Dack Island, in St. James's Park, to the gravel beds of Hyde Park. Within tho last 10 years great additions have been made to our knowledge of the geology of London, excavations and borings have been made for sewers and other public works and the various strata have been more fully ascertained and defined. Our present information, therefore, is such as to enable us to form a more accurate opinion than was possible at the time the note in question was written by that eminent geologist, the late Dr. Buokland. Westminster, like Chelsea, Lambeth, and all the lowlying western districts of London. stands upon gravels and sands of a depth of 25 to 30 feet, with a breadth of from two to two and a-half miles, overlying a thick stratum of London clay. These gravels are separated from the Hyde Park and Kensington Garden gravels by a peculiar and well-defined terrace of the London clay, which rises abrnptly 30 to 36 feet, and may be traced on the surface from Holland-park, through Kensington, the C-ore estate, Knightsbridge Barracks, St. George's Hospital, Jermyn-street, and thence by Somerset-house. The small, high level, gravel springs of Hyde Park, conseqnently, have no connexion with the water supply to the shalow welUs and springs of West. minster and parts adjacent, and the source of these wells must be considered due to the rainfaU on the valley surface, local soakage, and a hmited infiltration of the River Thames. Thorney Island, the site of Westminster Abbey, there can be no doubt, was originally surrounded with water, and no portion of its natural surface would seem to have bee& more than a foot above high-water mark, and even at the present time it has only attained an artificial height of two to five feet; also, the lake of St. James's Park (originally a creek), the surface water of which is about 5 feet belowhighwater, was evidently connected by brooks and watercourses with the Chelsea creek and ponds, which are now confined within the quay walls of the Grosvenor basin and canal. It may be interesting to state that in the Westminster gravelsMamnalian remains are frequentlyfoand. Fronthe saudy beds abutting against the before-mentioned abrupt line of London clay in the recent excavations for sewers in St. James's-suare and for the foundations of the Junior United Service 6lub, Charles-street, Haymarket, tusks, teeth, and bones of the elephant, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, ox, &c., wero obtained, specimeris of some of which are preserved carefully at the last named club. I am, Sir, yours obediently. R. W. IYLNE. Aflthenme, June 6.
THE ENDOWMENT OF COLKEBROOK. TO THE EDITOR. OF THE TIMES. Sir,-My attention has been drawn to a statement made in Tlhe Times of the 5th inst. in reference to the Bishop of Oxford's description of the endowment of this incumbency. As I am sure you will wish that the truth should be elidted on the subject, will you allow me, as the person most concerned, to say that the Bishop was perfectly right when he osid that " Colnbrook, with a population of 1,400, had an endowment of a house and four acres of land," and that " Oxoniensis? " statement is quite incorrect? The facts which have misled that gentleman are these Mr. Townshend founded two lectureships at Uxbridge and Colnbrook, aud attached them to a foundation at Pembroke College, Oxford. These he endowed with moieties of cer. tain rents in Drury-lane. In the case of Colnbrook this lectureship is independent of the incumbency, and, as a fact, the 100L in question neither must be,is, nor can be part of the endowment of Colnbrook. It is trve that a very liberal portion of the sum in question is paid to me by the present lectmuer for preaching the sermons, bat this is only a personal arrangement. Trusting that you will be good enough to insert this, BelieveA M. V.Wrn, I CBIARL.LES fARIW(;%n flATnTT1 Colnbrook Parsonage.

The effective of theImperial Guard has notbeen increased,butitstwocompanies of engineers have been formed into adivision, andthe regiment of dragoons has taken the name of " Dragoons of the Empress." The gendarmerie, of which a regiment and a squadron figure in the Imperial Guard, consist of 25 legionsof the colonial companies, the legion of Algeria, the Garde de Paris, and of a battalion of seven comparaes of firemen (pompiers). The infantry consists of 346 battalions, divided into 2,806 companics :-addng the Imperial Guard, the number Is 379 battalions and 3,014 companies; its offlcers are 118 colonels, 1U7 lieutenant*oolonels, 506 chefs de bataillon, and 3,780 captains.

Since then a man and his wife named Wright, and two men, named HolUis and Bentley, have been examined before the magistrates, when it appearedfrom the evidence of Superintendent Palethorpe that Wright and his wife were apprehended at Sheffield just as they were taking the morning train to Liverpool They were carefully searched, when 35X in gold was oud coneaed about a child they were carrying. Wright upon being searched began to swear fearfuUy, and in reply to Palethorpe, who told him he always understood the Mormons were not allowed to swear, said, "Oh, be -, I put religion aside; in such a case as this I don't mind stretching a point." They were then conveyed to Mansfield, where the two other Mormons were apprehended (Hollis and Bentley), who were each put in a separate cell. It having been ascertained that some luggage had been sent by Wright from the Mansfield railway station to Liverpool in the name of Ann Jones, a telegraphic mesGage was sent from Nottingham to Liverpool, directing the authorities at that station to stop the luggage. Pale-horpe immediately started for Liverpool, and obtained the serviceg of a clever detective. They then engaged a boat, and followed the ship, she having gone out of dock do vn the river. When they got on board they saw Ann Jones, who was also a Mormon, she having signed the book for the luggage. They proceeded to examine it, when Palethorpe found a bag containing 150l. in gold, which he took possession of, as also of the luggage, and returned with the whole to Mansfield. When acting in his capacity as a Mormon preacher, a few days ago, and since Le had abstracted the check, Wright said no man could say he had wronged 'nim, he stood there with an unblemished character, although it has since been discovered that, in addition to the above, he has robbed his late employer, Colonel Coke, to great extent. Indeed there is ncarly a cartload of goods stolen from him at the broker's to whom Wright haa sold his furniture. THE TnAaNT RIGHT (IRELAND) BnL.-This Bil has been brought in by lr. Moore and Mr. Maguire. The preamble recites the present state of the lawr wih regard to improvements made by tenant farmers in Ireland, and it is proposed to be enacted that tenants having made improvements which increase the value of the premises are not to be evicted without being paid for the same a compensation equivalent to the increased value created. The limitation is to agricultural tenements, and to improvements wich increase the value orannual rent of the premises. There are regulations for feferring disputed cases to arbitration; if an award be not made any claim not exceeding 1001. is to be referred to the assistant barister at the quarter sessions, and a jury may be impannelled, if required by either of the parties; if the claim exceeds 1001. it is to be referred in like manner to the judge of assize. A tenant who has made claim for compensation is not to be evicted till his claim has been decided, and the amount of such decision paid; if a tenant be refused liberty to sell his interests, he may offer to surrender, and claim compensation as in other cases; if a tenant's claim for compensation shall be refused, he may pull down and remove the same, leaving the premises in the same condition as before. SALE OF STOCK BY Auorox AT FAiRs.-A practice has lately sprung up in Worcestershire and other coumties of disposing of cattle and sheep by auction at fairs. lt has latterly much increased at the principal fairs held in Worcestershire, the farmers adopting this plan as affording a means of more readily obtainsng prompt payment from the butcher and dealer; and it is found that the prices are often better than those which they can obtain in the ordinary way of bargain and sale. Recently the butchers and graziers of Woroestershire and the surrounding country, considering that the practice is injurious to their interests, signed a manifesto, which was published through the medium of the local newspapers, affirming that the practice of public auctions in the markets interrapted business, wag injurious to the trade, and had a tendency to keep up the present high prices of stoc}; they thtrefere pledged thenselves not to attend or bid at such auctions. The farmers, howvever, continued to send cattle for sale by aactiori and at the lest Worcester fair there were two or three Auctiona of this kind. On the cattle beinz put up the butchers and drovers interfered, drove awy a beaste, which they beat unmercifully, and prevented e saes Some of the cattle were stabbed, and several los tra not put up to auction at all owing to the determine jthe butchers, and from fear of the cattlt being injuredQ
!']BE ART TREASUBES BXHIBXTIO.V. There was the greatest number of visitors at the Exhibition on Friday that have yet been present, 10,266 having entered on payment of Is. each, and 1,258 with season tickets; total, 11,24. Of these 5,021 arrived by railway, mostly from places near Manchester, but there were also excurdion trains bringing pasengers from Oxford and places along the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton, and another from Handforth, on the London and North-Western line. On Saturday the visitors numbered only 8,553, of whom 7,082 paid for admission, andl,471 were admittedby season tickets. Of these 1,492 arrived by railway from Manchester and neighbourhood, there being no special trains from a dis tance. The more limited attendance on Saturday than Friday is difficult to account for, Manchester being excessively crowded with strangers, mostly of the working classes, during the whole of the day. It was what is locally termed "gaping Saturday," when country people flock into the town from great distances, and wander abolat the streets looking at shop windows and gazing at anything which may strike them as novel and wonderfuL Of such people there must have been something like 20,000 or 30,000, at a low estimate; but it is evident that works of art have little attraction for such visitors, those of them who are disposed to go beyond the streets preferring the races or public gardens, with dancing and their more exciting amnsements. The attendances during Whit week at the art treasures have been large, however, though falling below expectation. In compliance with awah verygeneraUyexpressedforanampler and more vaied account of the extensive gallery of British portraits the director of the gallery, Mr. Peter Cunningham, will in the course of next week endeavour to meet the want thus manifested by the publication of a volume of anecdotes connected with the pictures, the persons represented, and the prices p aid to Vandyke, Mytens, Bely, Reynolds, and Kneller for some of the principal portraits in the Exhibition. The volumne will form at the same tine a sort of key or guide to the gallery.
MUSIC IN THE CRYSTAL PALACE. The Crystal Palace is beco ming more and more mudcal The Friday concerts of tho Royal Italian Opera company are attracting their accustomed thousands, although-except on a recent occasion, when the Stabat Hater of Roesiai was performed entire-the programmes have been so exclasively compiled from hackneyed materials as not to call for any special notice. We are aware how difficult It is to persuade Italian singers to study anything out of their own particular line; bnt surely something might be done with the band and chorus to vary the stereotyped selections from popular operas, and thus confer an air of greater musical importance upon the concerth The performances under the direction of Her Manns are vastly improving. Not only are the programmes better, because more intermixed with music of an elevated character; but the band itself has been reinforced in the string department, and is thereby enabled to give greater effect to the symphonies, overtures, and other instramental pieces. A little further progress in the same direction will make the permanent orchestra what it should have been from the outset-a worthy representative of music in the palace of the arts. The concert on Saturday presented more than ordinary attraction, and brought together one of the largest assemblies for some time congregated at Sydenham. The excep. tional feature was the Cologne Choral Union, which en. grossed at least three-fourths of the prozramme, the duties of Herr MAIanna' orchestra being confined to an overture by ML Berlioz (Les F-ancs JTuges), one of the ballet scenes from Robert le Diable, and the march from Mx. Charles Horsley's Comus. We were glad to find that the selection of pieces allotted to the German singers included several things of the highest worth, instead of being almost wholly comprised of trifles, as on previous occasions. This being the case, there could be no possible objection to the pretty effusions of MML Becker, lincken, Silcher, and Otto, which, sparingly administered, afforded a notunpleasing variety. The introduction, opening chorus, and hymn to Bacchus, from Mendelssohn's Antigone, and the samue composer,s cantata ("An die Kuntler") for chorus and brass instruments, written for the inauguration of the Cologne Music-Festival in 1846, were the important pieces, and showed the admrirable qualities of the choir in a new and striking light. Here it was all legitimate singing-mouths open, instead of shut, with no trivial and unmusical "effects'-genuine partsinging, in short, worthy of the most finished executants and the rnost cultivated audience. The result in the instance of the Canta (which, set to the poetry of Schiller, inculcates doctines with respect to art well deserving the consideration of our excellent and harmonious friends from the Rhine) was triumphant, and proved this Cologne Union equal to the interpretation of lofty as well as of puerile Ideas The pieces from Antignse would have been entitled to the same unqualified eulogy had they not been taken at so slow a pace as in a great measure to rob them of their character and spirit. Not only the choruses, but the instrum,ental prelude which leads into the first of them was chargeable with this error. Herr Weber would appear to entertain a different notion from Mendelssohn about the times; but, for evident reasons, we are inclined to believe that Mendelssohn's own view of his own music was the best. Among the minor pieces were a chorus called "The Approach of Spring," by C. Kreutzer, and a cantata for chorus and orchestra by C. L Fischer, entitled Meeresatie und G1luck-ichc Fchrt, both exhibiting a higher aim than the majority of the part-songs with which the Cologne singers have been in the habit of regaling the British public. Herr Fischer, however, may with some justice be arraigned for presumption, Beethoven having treated a portion of the same sabjeet inchorus, Mendelssohn the whole, in one of his most picturesque concert-overturesand both with remarkable originality and success. The audience received the choral performances with the warmest enthusiasm, and there were several (not very judicious) encores We must not omit to notice the very clever performance, by M. Pape, of a clarinet concertino by Weber. After the concert Mr. Henry Smart afforded an unexpected treat by sonme masterly improvisations on the great organ built by Messrs Gray and Davison for the approaching Handel Festival, andwhich is to remaina fixtureinthe CrystalPalace. The instrument is now almost entirely finished, and the belief already entertained of its excellence derived encouragement from this test of its quality furnished by the experienced hand of Mr. Smart. It may not bo out of plaeo to state that the preparations for the Handel celebration are in the most f orward state. The last rehearsal of the London depatment of the chorus took place on Friday at Exeter-hall, under the direction of Mr. Costa, when the choruses front sraed in Rgypt were once more gone through, and in such a manner as to justify tho most favourablo auticlxatiow. The extra instrumental accompaniments, written by M. Costa, for Judas Jfaccabas,u, wero tried on Saturday ; and the great rehearsal, in which the entiro choral body wiil take part, is fixed for Friday evening, in the samo building. On the following day a full rehearsal, vocal and instrumenttal, is to be held in the Crystal Palace; and then, for tho first time, Will be tested the united strongth of this ntprocedented assemblage of singers and players, together with the acoustical capabilities of tho vast area which has been prepared for their exhibition.
WHOLESALE SHOPLIETr G AT PLYmovss.-Saturday.-Two women, Eliza Gorfin and Earriet Hookway, at whose apartments in the Octagon a quantity of drapery goods was found yesterday, were brought before the mags. trates to-day and remanded. For some time suspicion as been attached to their proceedings, but, act in concertk they have by various feints successfully eluded the watchfulness of Inpector Thomas, until, aided by an assistant in the employ of Mr. Parkhouse, draper, he discovered their retreat and detected them in the act of trying to concesl their day's plunder tnder a sofa cushion. Goo valued at mnore than 50L, and sufficient to commence business, were subsequently found. They consisted of a number of silk and barege dresses, aud costly shawls, mantles, and scarves, over 100 yards of rich ribands of various tterns, 19 yards brown lawn, some expensive bonnets, ats, and flowers, a quantity of stockings, socks, &c. uring the examination it transpired that on Friday morning they visited the shop of ,lessmr. Popham and Xadford, and stoe a parcel of silk braid, and after going to other shops had the temerity to return in the afternoon with the braid still in their possession, and smake a second small purchase, Watches and other valuable articles were found in their apartments, the walls of which are decorated with oil paintings of the family, costing 61. each. The prisoners are sisters, from Bideford, married to artisaus earning 27s. per week each in the Devonport dockyard. REGuLATIONS FOR IALE BATEsS.-2Iany complaints are usually made in the season of theannoyanoe caused at the sea-side by the exposure of the persons of bathers. A Bill ha- been brought into the House of Lords by the Marquis of Westmeath to redress this grievance. It empowers the bench of magistrates in any county, city, or borough where bathing publicly takes place, to make reasonable regulations and by laws for the prevention of the exposure of the nude persons of bathers, including the power to compel such bathers to wear a garment suitable to prevent any such indecent exposure. The penalty for offending aginist these regulations or by laws will be 40s. for every offence, wth cots, or the alternative of imprisonment in gaol, with or without hard labour, for three calendar months.

RZOyAZ SUBBRY GARDENS. Tho musical performnces at these gardens, under the superintendence of 1L Jullien, continue to be of a highly attractive character, and the progrmmes, ccording to ths method usually adopted by that distinguished Public enter. tainer, have presented a judiclons combination of popalnr and clasical pieces. It is worth a visit to the gardens, and an hour spent in the music hail, if only to hear ons of the symphonies of Beethoven or Mendelkohn executed with suech admirable vigour and pre. cision by Xd Jullien's powerful orchestra, the members of which, by means of constant practice together, have reached degree of efficiency attainablo in no other way. The Italian symphony of Mendelmsohn has long been one of the stock-pieces of the band; but the 7th symphony of Beethoven, a still more elaborate and difficult work, seems now to be the favourite medium for exhibiting its profi. ciency to tho public. To make popular, in the strict sense of the term, a composition of so high a character would puz2le any one less confident of the public ear than IL JuUien ; but, having aet himself the task, he hag already made the two middle movements as familiar to his numerous patrons as any part of the "C minor" or the " PastoraL" How little the audiences that resort to the Surrey-gardens are indifferent to the beauties of this noble symphony is demonstrated in the decorous attention with which it is listenedto from beginning to end, andthe hearty plaudits that greet the termination of every movement. As a set-off against the symphonies the seleoctions-Z Trovatote, La Traviata, and others-goon enchantingthe multitude, and displaying to eminent advantage the wender. fuly finished solo-playing of 3. Jullien's chief performers, M. Lavigne, Herr Kcenig, Mr. Hughes, M. Duhem, aud others, unsurpaed on their particular instraments. The latest novelty in a special department-that of dance music-is the new galop entitled 17ie Great Comet, a so-caUed descriptive piece, announced in the programmes as " classic and romantic, dramatic and melodramatic, astronomic and pyrotechnic, eclectic and. empiric, terrific and comic." How far all these characteristics are exemplified in the music itself we are not in a condition to ay. But that matters very httle, since the Great Cmet Gaop has made a decided hit with the public, and is one of X. Jullien's most ingenious and effective performanoes of its class. The thetne of the gplop is marked and rhythmical, and the various phases under which it is presented show that its composer'a invention of orchestralcombinationsandresource8isanything but exhausted. The execution isirreproachable both foraccu racy of detail and vigorous unanimity of attack. Singing is as usual a feature in the musical entertainments, and the -popular English soprano, Miss Vinning, has been sacceeded by Madame Gassier, whose briUiant vocalization in the Venzano waltz, " Ah non giunge," and other well-known pieces, created the usul utonishment; in short, this very original Spanish songstress is a reigning favourite in the music-hall. The musical festival which inaugurated the opening of this establishment so brilLiantly last season is to have its parallel very shortly. On Friday evening a series of entertainments, on an unusually grand scale, is to commence with the oratorio of 17hc Creation The festival is to last 10 days. 27e Crcaton wiil be followed by Blijaz, Elijah by Haydn's Season; and then, in alternate succesion, we are promised a Rosmni, a Verdi, a Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Mozart night. The host of artists engaged, besides the band and chorus, which are to be as numerous as oa the previous occasion, includes Mesdames Gassier, Rudersdorff, Caradori, Fiorentini, and Weiss, MademoiselleWesterstrand, Misses Louisa VWining, Stabbach, and Dolby, Messrs Sims Reeves, Gassier, Reichardt, Weiss, Ferren, &c. (vocalists); Herr Ernst, Siguors Bazzini, Sivori, Piatti, Andreolit, Bottesini, 3Lriss ArabeDa Goddard, &c. ginBtrumentalists) Thus ardent lovers of music who viSit London dunag theprogress of the Handel Festival in the Crystal bwhe at no loss for means of indulging their favourite passion by night asiwell as by day.
RAILWAY LEGISLATto4. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-While thanking you as a railway shareholder for the manner in which you have noticed our endeavours to remove the great evil of defective legislation under which our property has so long suffered, I w ould beg to convey through your columns to all who may join in this cause a caution which, but for certain statements made at the meeting noticed in your Thursday's impression, I shoald hardly have thought necessary. At that meeting Mr. G. Smith wisely advised us not to weaken our cause by trying for too much, and I woald second this excellent advice by entreating all who engage in this matter to avoid the stiU greater mistake of making positive statements without firt carefully ascertaining that they are correct, as such unguarded statements, though no doubt made in all good faith, are frequently grossly misleading. One of the speakers at the meeting held on Wednesday at the London Tavern, joining in the popular though, I think, mistaken belef that the mail service is performed on railways at anything but highly remunerative prices, states (to prove that the companies are underpaid) that " the number of miles per diem over which the mail was carried by railway was 28,692, and by coaches and other vehicle8 32,721. The railways were paid at the rate of 9id. per mile, and the coaches and other vehicles were paid at the rate of 1Od. per mile." Without stopping to prove that to the public at large railway conveyance is far cheaper than traveling by coach, -a thing which every one must admit,-or pausing to do more than inquire why the public in the aggregate (for the Post-office acts on behalf of the public) should not enjoy the same advantages of cheaper locomotion as it does individually, I beg to state that if any one wiU take the trouble to refer to the table in the third report of the PostmasterGeneral, page 8 (from which publication, in all probability, the speaker in question obtained his information), it wiU be found that the average charge for railway conveyance of mails has been compared with the maximum charge for mail coach conveyance, the truth being that, while railway conveyance of mails costs the public on the average 94d. per mile, coach conveyance of mails costa but 21d. per mile, showing that railways are paid on the average four times as much per mile as mail coaches and other vehicles. The maximum payment in each case is-railway conveyance, 4s. 10d. per single mile; coaches, 10Id. per single mile. The other argument that was brought forward-viz., that because the amount paid by the companies for passenger duty exceeds that which they receive for the conveyance of the mails, therefore the mails are conveyed " without any remuneration whatever," is too absurd for any lengthy notice. The companies have no more right to set off the passenger tax against the payments by the Poct-offlice than they have to compare the income-tax with what they obtain for tho conveyanea of mails for the sake of proving that this servioe is performed for nothing. A contractor who supplies the army with boots and shoes might just as well argno that he did so gratuitoudy if he found that the amount he received for his goods was less than that which he paid in taxes ou his tea, coffee, tobacco, &o. No good cause ever yet prospered through misrepresentation, howrever unintentiona, and ours certainly wvU prove io exception to so natural a rule, more especially as, in this ase, our own side will bo the only parties deceived, as the Iloard of Trade and the Government are certain to know tho real facts of tho case, and to judgo of our cause according to the truth of our statements. I am. Sir. your obedient ser-nt A RAMWAV RRAPFVTT.Tnh. London, June 6.
FmI AND Loss oF PRoErrTy.-.Yesterday morning, about 5 o'clock, a fire broke out in the wellknown range of promises termed the Red Lion Inn at Bounslow. The premises were in the occupation of Mr. Timothy Lewis, lioensed victnaller, and, with the exception of the person wvho first discovered the fire, the inamates were in their beds fast asleep, and how they managed to effect their escape in safety appears marvellous. From the particular obt:eind on the spot it aDpears that one of the female inmates was awtaken ed by experieneing a suffocating sensation. Sho immediately informed Blr. Lewis, who at once made his way to the ground floor, where he saw the parlour enveloped in flames, and the fire was then working up the stairs and through the different upper floors towards the roof. Tho moment the inmates were got out information of the disaster was sent to tho London fire-engine establishment in King. street, Golden-square, when Mr. Staples, the chief officer of the C section, started to the spot with a powerful engie, well manned with firemen. UJon gaining the sceno he foundthat three parish engines had previously arrived, as well as one belonging to the Hoanslow barracks, under the command of a body of soldiers Unfortunatelv, the only supply of water that could be obtained was a long Iistance off, and, in order to make it available, it was found necessary to work the various engines into achb other before a drop of water could be scattered upon the fire, which kept progressing so fiercely that it was feared that the clothing warehoupe belonging to Mr. B. Milton, next door, would also have been destroyed by the flames This induced the persons near to remove the whole of the stock in trade, fixtures, and windows, by which ex. pedient aserious amountof property was either broken into fragments or extensively damaged by water. The military the parih engines, an the London fire brigade laboured in a most praiseworthy manner, but in spite of this they were unable to make the lerst impression upon the fire, and eventually the flames extended to the roof. The different persons employed in extinguishing the conflagration at length-but after the lapse of some hourssucceeded in getting it subdued, not, howrever, until pro. pert% of great value was destroyed - in fact, one-half of tne Epacious building, including the back cellars, the parlours, and tap rooms on the ground floor, and several bed rooms on the first floor, together with their cogly oontents, were consumed, independently of the damage done to the roof, which is very serious, and the injury to the for- iture sad building belonging to Mr. Milton. Fortunately, Mr. Lewis wras insared sm the Royal Exchange Fireoffice, an M£r. Milton wras insured in the same office. The buildings were the property of Mlr. Farnell. -the brewrer, bu'it could not be ascertained whether or not they were insued,

In short, they do not, reeoil before the idea of seeing the law on.. chary carried at thepoint of thebayonet. During this temporary cessation of hostilities it may, not be. without mterest to give Some futher conoiieratiom to the causes of the late disturbanc and their probable consequencesl. Belgium posseses a fertile soil an industriouspopulation, extensive commerce, and large nnfactures. The constitution is liberal, the n most deservedly popular, the las well niniste and no political grievances exist. The revolution of 1830 secured the ascendancy of the Roman Catholi. creed. It is eminently the national religion, fordisent is rare and iufidelity almost unknown. How comes it, then, that the NTuncio of the Pc r t God's vicegerent upon earth, is hooted in iJt / street; that priests are mobbed; and n-nu molested; that convents are attacked; and bishops. condemned to seek safety in flight; and thatthese outrages are committedbyRoman Catholics. true believers-disciples of the very creed whose mini-ters they insult? The caues are swofold :-First, an extended suffrage, which bestowed the elective franchise on a peasantry incapable of estimating its value or of exercising the political power conferred upon them - secondly, the character of the Roman Catholiechurch, which boasts itself unchanging and unchangeable, semper eadem,-whose priesthood i._ ever persecuting and aggressive, ever bigoted andl intolerant. In 183U Belgium, by a junction of the Liberal party and the Roman Catholic clergy, freed herself from Dutch rule and Protestant ascendancy. The Roman Catholic church became thereby a badge of her nationality, and was in fact one of the main, causes for the triumph of which the people fought_ The revolution sea ed the Liberals firmly in power. The franchise was settled on a rational basis, an the Government of x Rogier repelled priestly domination and insured rational liberty. The church, however, being free from State control,. gradually increas-din wealth and power and,though independent of ihe State received large revenues from it. Still ihe intelligence of the country kept it effectually in check, and political power being chiefly in the hands of the more. educated classes no great mischief could be done. In 1848 a large extension of the sufrage was granted. The peasants were for the firsttime invested with political rights, which they wereunable to exercise without advice and assitance. They therefore consulted the cures, who, in fact, became the delegates of the entire body of peasantry. Thenceforth the powver of theclerical party has been gradually increasing. At thelast election no Liberal candidate was returned forGhent, and the whole of the Flemish province3 arerotten boroughs in the hands of the priest. Hence the danger lest the church should become the greater, the State the minor powerin the country. It has been gradually concentrating in its hands the seminaries of education. The proposed law would have given it the means of amasuing wealtb, and it looked forward with hope to the day,-when the present King was. gathered to his fathers,-that a monarch educated,. by the Jesuits, and married to an Archduchess of Austria, might by a concordat with Rome deliverthe nation entirely into its power. So much for the effects of a suffrage bestowed upon an ignorant peasantry under priestly control. In vain has the intelligence of the country petitioned and protested. In vain have MI^ge, Vervier3, and the Walloon provinces returned Liberal Deputies. The might of numbers has triumphed; reason and argament have succumbed to brute force. In France. universal suffrage has produced a despotism. Although the educated classes stand aloof from the Imperial Government, there is no doubt that were the "country" again consultel again would the Empire be voted by an overwhelm-. ing majority. A somewhat similar result has been produced in Belgium by a suffrage all but universal. The dictatorship of the church has been substituted for that of the Emperor. A Parliamentary system and constitutional institutions have prolonged the struggle, and the debates in the Chamber have roused the educated classe to a sense of their danger. "The mindoof France is smothered," said a distinguished Frenchman. The mind of Belaium is not yet smothered, but it is overborne and overlaid by brute force, though the Liberal speakers made a gallant defence in the Chambers. "Whatnext andnext?" isthequestionnowto beanswered. Will the Ministry withdraw theirBill? They can hardly do so after their declarations in the Chamber, and in face of the decided attitude assumed by their supporters throughout the country. It is believed that a minority in the Cabinet, with M M. De Decker and Vilain XIV. at its head, is in favour of withdrawal; but the majority stands firm and insisbt on no surrender. WiU the 3rmistry bemodified by the withdrawal of its more Ultramnontane mnembers ? The clerical party "bhates . coalition"' and the existence of a moderate Government would probably be but shortlived. Wi1l the King dissolve the Chambers and appeal to the country? A dissolution with the present extended eufilage might possibly strengthen the clericalparty, but it would most undubitably fail in giving the Liberals a majoritv in the new Parliament. The priests would take care that every one of their candidates wFaspledgedto supportthe obnoxious Bill, easd the peasatry wrould act as directed by the priests. The strength of the clerical party consist3 int1his peaeantry, whio are scattered throug,hout the villages and country districts. They return a maioritv of7 representatives and are governed by politieal jrejudice and reaigiouB bigotry, deaf to the calls of reason and common sense. The Liberal Forc are united in the towns, and they seem perfectly ready, if need be, to rise against further clerical aggression. Did they constitute the majority of electors the danger would be but smal, for they would at once withdraw a measure which provoked such ill-feeling. Will the Government endeavour to carry their Bill at the point of the bayonet? If tbe attempt be made serious consequences must inevitably ensue, and no one can foretell the result. Most fortunateis it for Belgium that at such a crisis sbe is ruled bya Sovereign who unites prudence with wisdom, firmness with discretion. All his well-nown tact and. judgment WilU be required in the solution of the, preient difficulties, and England may well be proud. of the Monarch she recommended to the Belgian nation, one who has so well profited by the lessons in constitational government he received ou herbhores. I remain, Sir, your obedient servant. AN EGTGSH RESEDENT IN BELaTrrw June 6.
