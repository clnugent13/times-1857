THB INDIAN MUTINIES. -- - -- l O TUE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The President of the Board of Control was probably in the right when he refused to send troops to India vid Egypt. The time which must be lost in preparation, the difficulties of the Red Sea, and the strength of the monsoon would have made that the longer route. But there is one point to which troops might be transported by this road, and which Is at this moment in no pleasant position. I rean Adan. That fortress, thfe key of the Overland Route, has now just 30 Artillerymen, about 100 European gentlemen, and 1,000 SepoYs in garrison. There !s not, I admit, much danger of disturbance within. The Sepoys, if ever so inclined to mutiny-and they appear perfectly loyal-know well that, with the Desert on one side and the sea on the other, they must obey or perish. But-It is true, also, that the fortifications are strong, that the station is for once most ably ruled, that Arabs do not read newspapers, anid may knownothingof whatispasing in IndiA. But-It is true that the ships offer an easUy available refuge, that provisions can never fall short, that we hav3 recently enlarged the supply of water. But-All these points depend on an IF, and the defence of Aden should be a certainty. It wants only 500 Europeans to be beyond contingencies, and they might reach It in a month. Five steamers now pass down the Red Sea every month-two for Bombay, two for Calcutta, one for Australia. Order each steamer, as it passes Malta, to take on board 100 Europeans. Pass them through Egypt as second-class passengers. I have seen 70 of them taken at once, so there can be no nonsense about time, water, or conveyance. Drop them at Aden, and in one month the place is beyond the possibility of attack even from Arabs wild with the success of their brethren in the NorthWest. You might reinforce Ceylon in the same fashion. You can send 300 men per month, and the place only wants about 600. So also, though you cannot send troops to Calcutta, you can send Artillerymen; 200 trained Artihlerists per month would make no slight difference in the available resources even of the Government of India. Ai for the permission of the Pasha, it will doubtlesa be given readily but I would ask one question :-If it is unjust to send 100 soldiers as aecond-clas passengers across Egypt, how comes it to be so correct that 100 officers should pass through firstclass? Are officers not soldiers? I only ofEer the suggeetion because I think I have seen in this struggle some indications of a willingness to examine plms irregularly offered, instead of pooh-poohing them. I am.

THB MAHOMMEDAS IrN INDIA. TO TEB EDITOR OF THIF TIMES. Sir,-As the light slowly breaks in upon the thick darkness which has hitherto covered, as with a funeral pall, the secret springs which have forced into fierce rebelion our Bengal soldiery and turned into the most deserate foes the men we have nourished and cherished ua our own flesh, it becomes more and more evident that Mahommedanism is at the bottom of the horrible catastrophe. A passionate desire to regain their dominant power over the vast and fertile territory where their rule was once supreme, enforced by a bitter hatred to the English race, both as their conquerors and as a nation of infidels, and encouraged by some passxges in their Koran cunningly interpreted by their priests into a prophecy of the downfal of our empire in the East, has induced some of our most inflientil Mahommsedan subjects to conceive and crryout a deep-laid scheme for the subversion of our rule in that most important portion of the British dominions. That it is such a Yzahommedan movement I think there can be now very little doubt. It is true the light yet thrown upon the deeplaid plot of this horrible tragedy is but the dinmeeb twilight. It may truly be said, in the words of our groat poet, to have but made the darkness visible, serving only to discover sights of woo. Still, from those many letters of doep, deep interest for the perusal of which the public is indebted to your columns we gain light sufficient to enable us to grope a little way into the glomny maze, and to catch some faint trace of that demoniac spirit which has long been darkly brooding over the diabolical progeny so lately hatched. We see on several oGcasions the Hindoo soldiery exhibiting signs of being reluctant parties in the movement. We find them warning their officers, and even escorting them in some cases to a place of safety-here a havildar major coming up to his officer's bungalow to warn him of impending dantger; there the Hindoo troopers meeting their officers on their way to the regimental line, and beseeching them to fly. Hindoo bearers are faithful, while, asin the case of Mr. Cumming, even his bearer, who, it seems, was a Moslem, sought to destroy him, and was only prevented attempting his life by the Bheels of his mraster's guard. On tha other hand, we see the cavalry, who are chiefly composed of Mahommedans, and the irregular cavalry more especially so, the first and foremost In the revolt Wherever stationed, they appear invariably to have ridden to the infantry lines and harangued the men into active rebellion. Many subordinate officers in civil employ, the followers of the Prophet, have proved traltors. The peculiar ferocity and the great extent of the outbreak in that Mahommedan stronghold, Rohiltund, with its fierce Patharn population; the fanatical uprising at Hyderabad and other dens of Mos lemism; and, above a, reinstating the Mogul, and their establishing themselves in their ancient capital,-all testify to the fact that our bitter foes, the followers of the Pro. phet, have been long preparing the mine which has now exploded which such heartrending results. The cry that their religion was in dauger, and ;in defence of this they had been forced to rise, is now seen to be a shallow deception-a mere gloss for their viUany. It was, no doubt, a cnnning and politic device to carry with them the more weak and superstitious of their Hindoo fellowsoldiers, and the farce of the greased cartridges was cunningly played ont to help forward their purpose. But, aS you have ably shown in your leader of Wednesday last, the notion that the Mahommedan could really and in earnest ever make common cause in religion with the Hindoo Is too monstrous to be entertained for a moment. The Hindoo aU along ig made a mere catspaw of by the more energetic and, I believe, equally subtle Mussulman. Every act in the fearful tragedy proclaims the frenzied ferocity of the Moslem, and that settled principle of his faith, the extermination of the infidel by fire and sword. Lynx-like Ma is the Brahmin, and cmel and treacherous as the Mahratta has often proved, tbough never, perhaps, so atrociously as im the person of that villain Nena Sahib, yet all history proves that the folowers of the Prophet stand forth conspicuous beyond all competitors for fierce cruelty and vwrs of extermination, sparing neither age nor sex. The farther we fathom the depth of this horrible conspiracy the more shall we discover that It has emanated solely from our Maahommedan subjects. Hlow, then, I ask, are we to deal with these untamaeable people in future? Are we to repose confidence again in such ctreaherous fanatics, place arms in their hands, and train and disciplino them in the art of war? The result of the attack of these furious bigots upon the Resideney at Hyderabad proves how powerle they are for evil vhen only an undisciplined rabble. Shall we, then, make them powerful by training aud discipline t Will our doing this render them more faithful friends, or more dangerous foes ? We may, perhaps, without nuch danger or even inconvenience continue to compose the omlih of our judicial and magisterial courts of our Mahommedan subjects, and employ them in other civil offices, though they will never be our friends. Bat to enlist them again as the protection of our person and pro. perty, the supporters of our laws, and a defence against our enemiee, and to arm them for this purpoe, after what has occurred, would be as insane a course as for a man to use a tiger for a watchdog. No, no ! we mnst have done wIth these insatiate fanatis' as soldiers. Let us have no more followers of the Prophet, no more priests of BrahLnah, as the guardians of the hated Christian and the defenders of their con-fiding British rulers The more clearly the true source of the calamity is revealed, the more distinctly wil it also be seen that the ont cry raised, on the Intelligence first reaching us, against missionary effort, as having contribated to the movement, is perfectly groundles There are certain individuals who, opposed to Christianity in their own heart, are ever ready to charge against It All the abominations that have ever been committed by the wickedness of man. Mon who can see no difference between the Divine tenets of Christianity and those of the followers of the fale prophet and the gross Idolatries of the Brahminical code-and I have known such -are ever redy to condemn msonary effort on any pretence. But all those who have closely watched the feelings ot the native% towards the missionaies and their work knorw lwe that their pron,Aient charwcterisdtc is one of perfect indifference, In the lraedhate ephere a their I.. bours they are generally regarded with muchrwespect; &nd W9 sbow the influence often gained by temamong the people I may mention the fact that One of our missionaries t Benares had, by the last acconts from that place, been applied to by the anthoritlec there to use that infuence I obtainig supplie on the Commiit faillng to prooure them. To attribute to them the prent terrible revolt is, th-r&. fore, perfeetly puerile. In the words of the Kooli Br to your Calcutta correspondent, "An Old Indian," it iz "mere nonsenseo. And this Is st1il more evident from the fact that the rebellion Is confined to those very men whe have been the most exempt from missonary efforL That some of the more rabid fanatics among both xA. honitnedaus and Brahuins are madly opposed to the dissemination of truth, and espedcilly the truth of Christianity, as one wll deny. All light is hxteful to them, boeaue It exposes their debasing idolatry, and condemns their conduct, and as this is eapecialy the effect of the light of Christl. anity they must hate it But, If we believe in Its powers t7 benefit maLn kind, if wo acknowledge the Bible to be a revv lation from God to man, shall we, as a Christlan nation, prove such cowardly trAitors to the truth as to put an, end to the circulation of the Word of God, and to tY efforts of the legitimate misionary among our benighted fellow-subjects, because the agents of darkness, the priest of superstition and Idolatry, cry ouk as of old, " Awaywitk him rP God forbid I We, as the Christan rules and guar. dians over that people, hare aplain oommiid to obey Ad sacred duty to perform, and let the timid and the infidelay what they may, woe be unto us if we prove disobedient ^n4 unfaithful I Instead of harm having been done by any aid or countesanoe given to muimsLnkry work by Gevernor-Generals or the Government, it has been all the other way. Their faithlessness to themselves as a Chritian 6overnment, their temporizing policy, their truccling to Elindoolam vue day and Mahommedanism another, their worshlp ot cate AnA bowing down to the prejudices of our bigoted feliow-stb. jects, that trembling and epostate spirit which shrank froux admitting a Bible into the Government sachools and Colleges And dared not avow with the ceremonies due to his rank the arrival of the first bishop in India, lest we should rouse the reigiousprejudices of the people,-itisrecreant actslike ths that have damaged our rule and encourged the native in a belief that we respected his religon and feared to offend him Such anunbecoming course mnst have aided the seditious and evil-disposed, and no doubt hua afforded them a powerful lever in upraising the presenut rebeion. Sti the origin of the outbrcak lies far deeper than al this, and when fully discovered will, I have no doubt, be found to exist in ths vulgar and natural desire of the early conquerors of India to regain their lost dominion and exterminate their hxted Christian rulers This hatred arises from no ill-treatment on our part Those who know Inda bhot must own that our rule hag been marked with the most tender dealing towards all race -perhaps too tender for those on whom It was exercied WVith an earnest desire to do justioe to the native, even to the almost injustice sometimes of the European, we have refined our laws to an extent 'which hxs led the evil-disposed to regard them as an evidence of our weakness and failing power, and to think that if he cannot quite trample upon. he may easlly evade them. t The sUmmary meaur now adopted under martial law wiU go far to restore our ascendancy, a*d show the people, who only regard leniency as weakness, that we can exerci3s retribution upon evil-doers. The position of affairs, ms revealed to us by the last mail, I consider on the whole to be favourable. The frantic eruption ha almost pent itself. With Nena Sahib routed, and I hope ere this gibbeted on the highest turret of his castle; their ammunition, especially copper cap3 and fuzes, which they cannot replae, falling short, while oEr forces ar converging from a11 points upsn the seat of rebel. I'on, I think we may confidently look fpr the accounts, by next mail, of the complete triumph of ,tr arms, and of just retribution having falen upon the heads of those rathless rebels who have so horrbly blackened the page of this world's history. I am, Sir, your most obedient servunt J.. H. MACDONALD, Iieutenant-ColoneL Sept. 8.
ThE ALIPORE. TO THE TDITOR OF THE TI3IES. Sir,-In your leading article of yesterday you say " you do not believe more troops could have been sent off thanr wre despatohed during the Lst two months, or with greater ex. pedition." To the latter part of your sentence I demur, for it is only to-day that I heard from Woolwich of the extraor dinary and vexatious delays which Uave prevented the Aliporo from leaving the English coas a week at least after the troops she was to onvey to India had all been put orL board. She left Woolwich on the 29th with a company of Artillery, andslUed to Gravesend, where she waa to take in a few infantry soldiers. She remained there until Wednesday morning waiting for offcia orders She then weighed anchor, and was allowed to drift dowvn the river, and had only arrived on Saturday evening a little south of Walmercastle, where in all probability she would lay for some days, as they had then a head wind. Now, I should like to, know who i3 to blame for not sending the official orders untU four days after the troops were cmbarked, and wby, when the vessel did weigh anchor, she was not towed out of the river I Certainly a week, and most likely at least ten days will have been lost. I remain yonr obedient serat. NOT AN HABITUAL GRUBTL;R. Burton.upon-Tront, Sept. 9. P.S.-The vessel WAR o1E.rterod by hr. Linds%y, M.]p.
THE PBIfCQE P1UDZ.RWK WILLIAA!S OOMPASSE& TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-With referenoo to Sir W. S. Harris's letter In Thi Times of to-day, I beg your permission to state, in justice to the Thames Iron Shipbuilding Company, who constracted and fitted the nev Dover mal packet to my entire satis. facion., that they never pretended that the oompasses supplied to ihe vessel wHere of Sir W. S. arris's invention,the comprsses they put on board were of a different oha. racter. Believing, hovrever, from long experience of its qualities, Sir W. S. Harris's to be the best and steadiest as a steering compass, having had a genuine one on board the well-knowx stesm, yacht Ondine for many years, the superintendent at Dover, deemed it advisable to order the comptss on board the Ondine to be transferred to the new and faster vessw and thus give the Prinoe Frederick William the advantag, as statad, of being fitted with Sir W. S. Harris's compas, as I explained to that distinguished inventor in a private letter last week.

A FRACAS UT An Ax=IAb EoTEL-On Saturday evening, the 15th ult, tho New York Hotel was the theatre of an abortivo dramn, in which one of the principal actors may congratulate himself ill having made a fortunao escape. The following are the precise details of the affair, &a we have obtained them from the best sources :-Among the transient residents of the hotel was Mrs. W -, a young and pretty lady from Louisiana, who was enjoying too freely her husband's absence, he having remained in New Orleans on account of business. A gentlemnua of middle age, said to be rich, an auctioneer by professton, Mr. F-. had " overbid" with the greatest success on the charming creole, and their intimacy had gone so far that It was no. ticed and commented upon by several inmates of the hotelAmong those was a friend of Mr. W-, who thought it his duty to advise him of what had ocorreod in his absence. and to enjoiR him, either by steamer or rail, to oome on as soon as peosible to put a. stop to the sondaL As sooa as he re ceived the messge Mr. W- left New Orleans without. advising any one of it, and arived in Noew York on Sehtrday evening, with a revolver in kis pocket, determined to take the law into his own hands, w as in such & dispo. sition of mind that he went to the New York Hotel, whore his faithless better half wa boarding, and liqniwed for the number of her room. He had no trouble at all to get In. Full of imprudent security, and- not suspecti that the outraged husband, whem they thon far ofwas already advancing in the hall-the two lovers had not even bDen cautaous enough to lock the dose. Mr. W- entered as if he wsu at home; and, althonug. it was very early in the evening, he found his wife aud Mr. - in a position eser to imagine than to descibe, and which did not admit of any possible false explanation. Without utterilg a word 1ir.W-drew !is revolver and ired at the glty party. Mr. F-, not, being hit, jumped out of bsIand ran to the door, where, on opening it, hre was shot at a second timne, arnd took flight headlong tovards the hsl, fo'lowved by his terrible enemy. The fugmeive had nothing on bet a single flannel undershirt, and at the moment it seetsed to he the least of his cares. But ono can judge of tho sensation creatod by this strange apparition among the persons hastening from all sides after the nolse of the firing of pistols- MA F-, running headforemost, arrived at the head of the, staire deenanded int great haste, turned to the rig-ht, and stoppea in oe of the cells of tho watercloses iof the hotel, in which he bolted himself close. The pursuit had been hot. He could hear fromn his unpoetical shelar the tumult on the stairs and the struggle to stop abd diarm the terrible husband. He, however, did not rely on his ears, and consonted to open the door only wsben summoned by the police and upon the formal promise that his life should be protected. It hu been sadL that Mr. F- was wounded, but we believo it to be uz.- true, unless one means the double wound to his love and his self-love. As Mr. W- immediately left tor the south with his wife, we are inelined to believe tbat tbhe affair wil go no further, after having caused less blood than sweat end tears to be shed.-Ncto Ycrk Hvrod,

LONDONY, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1857. That truth is often stranger than fiction, and that history produces events which the most audacious romancer would not have ventured to write, we may see in many incidents of this Indian story. Perhaps, however, the greatest paradox of all is the part which has fallen to the Punjab. Ten years ago the idea of our besieging Delhi with the old troops of RUNJMET SINGH, and conquering the Bengalese with troops drawn from the Valley of Cashmere and the Western extremity of the Sulimanee Mountains, could not possibly have occurred to any sane person. If it did ever present itself, it was only as a contingency centuries off. The great arsenal of Delhi was provided expressly against the dangers of our Northern and North-Western frontier; against Sikhs and Ghoorkas, and Hill people of all kinds; and, as it was possible it might one day have to stand a siege against them, it was strongly fortified. So far the anticipation has been amply realized. Delhi is besieged by Punjabees, Peshawurees, Mooltanees, and all sorts of Irregulars, from the foot of the Himalayas and our extreme Western froutier. The vast stores of the arsenal are found very serviceable for its defence, and their destructive eficacy justifies our prescience. But the parts in the long announced drama are strangely reversed. England is outside Delhi, and herself at the head of that deDrecated invasion. The "juggling fiend" who long ago led us to believe that Delhi would once again be found in the pathway of the conqueror from the NorthWest told the literal truth. He left us to supply for ourselves that we should load, and not resist, the advancing column. In Europe, it is true, forty years will change the characters, and find a common foe an ally, an ally a common foe. But in the preaent instance identity itself is transposed. The Punjab is now of us, and Delhi is a foreign power. Politician or moralist is equally at fault in the attempt to refer to common rules so strange a reverae, and extract from it a new lesson against the future. It only justifies the old warning that we don't know 'what a day may bring forth, and the old advice to remember that a friend may one day be a foe, and a foe one day a friend, and to treat them accordingly. Advioe of this sort is so much on the surface, so vulgar, and obtruded on us by so many people, that it is sure not to be heeded. Perhaps the lesson oomes most home to us in the diminished value it seers to'! assign to the mere material of war, and the greater value to the human agent. We have thrown away, or rather heaped up against our. selves, all the shot and shell, all the 150 pieces of artillery, the thousands of barrels of powder, the mountains of cartridges, the millions of percussion cape -we have carefully laid in store at Delhi. Ita fortifications are a pitfall into which we have fallen ourselveJ. The senseless material shares the treachery of its keepers. On the other hand, by the fortune of war,while giving wayeitherto thelustof territory, or more honestly seeking to strengthen and settle our frontier, we find ourselves masters of a new race of men, not only more martial, but with finer qualities, than the Hindoo. Warned by the experience of Cabul, our people took care whom they placed in the Punjab. We placed there such mea as LAWnENCE, EDwARDEs, REID, VAN CORTLANDT, and others-men prepared for peace or for 'war, able to conciliate as well as to conquer, parcere subjectis as well as debeltare snperbos. It is but a few years since the Indian MaU was bringing us the successive stages of the apparently desperate enterprise by which AMajor EDWARDES, with a handful of Europeans, but a marvellous power of making friends, recovered Mooltan, and restored us to our position in a newly conquered and still hostile country. In a lefter of his, which will be found in our columns this day, though written without the slightest thought of its ever being published, we see what has been effected by the power of such men over the minds of a generous and honourable race. Major EDWARDES had taken care of those who followed him to the siege of Mooltan. To the Mooltanese themselves, when the 'war was over, he and the Indian Government had shown liberality. All observe' the peace and prosperity that have followed our rule on the Indus and its tributaries. Accordingly, not only have the Bengalese mutineers at Lahore, Sealcote, Peshawur, Ahmedabad, and elsewhere found no response from the Sikhs and Irregulars-not only has each mutiny been promptly suppressed, but we have been able to draw large bodies of much needed Cavalry and other soldiers from this region for the restoration of our power in Central India. Though Lieutenant-Colonel EDWARDES is at a distance from Delhi everybody will be anxious to read his observations on the siege. It is a comfort to observe that he finds no fault with anybody, and writes as if the utmost had been done. The delay has been Vvery prejudicial to us, but, for anything the writer says, unavoidable. in " disorganized fragments of rebel regiments" he sees only a mob, certain to fall eventually before " the serried battalions of a well appointed army "5 led by British officers." Every man of this mob, though he fights with a halter round his neck, and with sufficient dapperation, fights also with the heavy heart of a traitor, and generally with another encumbrance of a more palpable character. It is a gang of robbers, fighting for their plunder, and with it hanging about them. Individually it is the richest army that ever took the field against us. Near two millions of money haye fallen into its hands; and such is the universal anarchy and mutual mistrust that these miserable wretches dare not deposit their booty with anybody, or anywhere, but carry it with them to battle. When they fall, every Sepoy is found with his bag of rupees tied round his waist, as sure as a bee has his bag of honey on a summer's afternoon. Of course, the heaps of' slain are speedily replundered, and the other day we read of a British trooper who had collected for his share as much as 1601. No doubt, our new Sikh fellow-subjects can appreciate a war with a golden enemy. As for the prospects of the siege, Lieutenant-Colonel EDWARDEs takes muchthe same view as most other old Indian authorities. He recurs to his experience of Mooltan, when General Wnss had to 'wait for reinforcements. We shall have to suffer a great deal and endure a great deal, but that suffering and that endurance have their limits, and in a few weeks from this present time twenty thousand British soldiers will tlrn the hitherto doubtful scale. " There never was " anything a hundredth part so serious in " India before." It would, indeed, be difficult to point out any event of equal gravity in any empire 'whatever, short of a revolution in the capital itself. But, with all the horrors, all the dangers, and all the difficulties of this rebellion, we see its tether. It is simply a question of Delhi and the MOGUL. A few coteries of Mahomedan intriguers, who have long been working on the simpler folly of the Brahmins, have seized a happy moment, as they thought, to restore their cruel, effete despotism. For the moment they have on their side the numerous classes that in India live by robbery and murder, and the feelings apt to be found everywhere against the reigning power. But the very idea of thi8 revolt, the restoration of the MOGUL, is not popular beyond the central region of India, certainly not west of the Sutlej ; and, though anarchy may elsevwhere take advantage of our difficulties, there can be no common object or combined plan of action out of the present area of the revolt.
It is like old times again to have Lord BnROUIGHAI addressing a Mechanics' Institute. He is on his own ground there, and is monarch of all he surveys. What he says of himself, too, is perfectly true"I ama myself, and have been all my life, a work"ing man; " and therefore, on that ground as well, no man has a greater right to address the operatives of Manchester. There is perhaps no man living of whom more feats of labour and triumphs over the frail phyaique of humanity are recorded than of Lord BR0UGHAir. Legends of this sort have gathered round him like a HcvEns. There is a legend that he once worked six continuous days-i. e., 144 hours, without sleep, that he then rushed down to his country lodgings, slept all Saturday night, sl' day, all Sunday night, and was waked by is valet on Monday morning to resume the responsibilities of life, and commence the work of the next week. A man must, of course, have a superhuman constitution who can do, we will not say this particular feat, which is perhaps mythical, but feats of this class, and probably the greatness of our great men is quite as much a bodily affair as a mental one. Nature has presented them not only with extraordinary minds, but-what has quite as much to do with the matter-with wonderful bodies. What can a man do without a constitution-a working constitution? He is laid on the shelf from the day he is born. For him no munificent destiny reserves the Great Seal, or the Rolls, or the Chief Justiceship, or the leadership of the House of Commons, the Treasury, or the Admiralty, or the Horse Guards, the Home-office, or the Colonies. The Church may promote him, for it does not signify to the Church whether a man does his work or not, but the State wil have nothing to do with the poor constitutionless wretch. He will not rise higher than a Recordership or a Poor Law Board. " But," somebody will ask, "has that pale, "lean man, with a face like parchment, and nothing "on his bones, a constitution VI Yea he has-he has a working constitution, and a ten times better one than you, my good friend, with your ruddy face and your strong muscular frame. You look, indeed, the rery picture of health, but you have, in reality, only a sporting constitution, not a working one. You do very well for the open air, and get on tolerably well with fine, healthy exercise, and no strain on your brain. But try close air for a week-try confinement, with heaps of confused papers and books of reference, blue-books, law books, or deapatches to get through, and there- from extract liquid and tranpat results, and you wi find youraelf knocked up and fainting, 'when the pale lean man is-if not " as fresh as a " daisy," which he never is, being of the perpetually cadaverous type-at least as unaffocted as a bit of leather, and not showing the smalleat sign of giving way. There are two sorts of good constitutions-good idle constitutions, and good working ones. When Nature makes a great mnn she presents him with the latter gift. Not that we wish to deprive our great men of their merit. A man musBt make one or two experiments before he finds out his constitution. A man of spirit and mettle makes the experiment, tries himself, aud runs the rsk, as a soldier does on the field. The battle of life and death is often fought as really in chambers or in an office as it is on the field. A soul is required to make use of the body, but a great man must have a body as well as a soul to work with. CHArm-s BuLLLR, Sir WILrxsA MOLESWORTH, and others are instances of men whose bodies refused to support their souls, and were therefore obliged to give up the prize when they had just reached it. And how many hundreds or thousands-if one did but know them-perish in an earlier stage, before they have made any way at all, simply because, though they had splendid minds, they had very poor bodies ! Let our lean cadaverous friend, then, when the laurel surmounts his knotty parchment face, thank Heaven for his body, which, he may depend upon it, is almost as great a treasure as his soul. Nature may not have made him a handsome man, but what does that signify ? She has made him a strong one. But, though Lord BRouGIrA has done a vast quantity of work in his day, like other great workmen he is sometimes not perfectly satisfied with his own creations, which fall shorL of the artificer's idea. His speech at MancheWcer is a mixed one. He is evidently disappointed with the worldng of Mechanics' Institutes. These institutions have now been in exislence 35 years, but it is only from 1848 that Lord BRouc}ur dates any effective working in them, and that only in a very limited sphere,-as far as we can make out, only in the single city of Carlisle. What he calls the " Cumberland rule" came into operation that year,-a rule which lodges the management of these institutions entirely in the hands of the working men themselvee. That rule was set up in Carlisle in the year above mentioned, and Lord Bao-uGnAmL declares that its effects in that city have been excellent, and that, where before only 25 out of 500 members of the Mechanice' lstitute of that place were working men, now the different institutes in the place include 640 of that class. But, though Carlisle has done its duty, Lord BBouGYAm is Very disatisfied with the working of the system in Manchester, where he considers that not more than one-fourth of the number of operatives that ought to be are members of Mechani' Institutes. Eis Lordship does not enter into another part of the subject, and examine what constitutes the favourite reading of those who do belong to these institutionm, and what shelves in the library are most used; if he had, he would prohhly have had to express still greater disappointment. We have touched on this subject on former occasions, and need do no more than alude here to the wellmnovm fact that operatives are guilty of likng novels a great deal better than. books of science and research. They have the presumption to imitate in this respect the example of the whole of the upper classes in this country. Had Load BRouGnAr entered upon this subject he would have been obliged, in consonance with the high sientific aims with which himself and his fellow-workers founded these insititutions, to frown upon these levities, and administer a severe rebuke to those who profit so little by their opportunities; and, had he done so, the operative woulcld have had something to say in his defence. He could have said that nature has not endowed aU men with the iron constitution which she has given to Lord RROuG1JA, and, though his Lordship imagines the operative burning with the thirst for kmowledge, and goes so far as to entreat him not to "slake it before he has finished his day's "' work," the real fact is tht a hard day's workdoes not generally leave behind it much thirst of this k-ind. Lord BBouImAJ could doubtless work in the hot courts the whole day, and " slake his " thirst" for optics at night; but human nature is not ordinarily up to such work. Lord Ha)uoHAam, however, does not enter into this qunestion. He wisely keeps outside of the Mechanics' Institute, and does not with impertinent curiosity inspect the interior, examine the bookshelves, and see 'which books are wellthumbed, and which have their margi&s white and smooth. When, 35 years ago, he and Dr. BiRxunno together founded Mechanics' Imstitates, he was full of the ardour of a new movement. All was science, progress, and march of mind in those days, and the intellectual enthusiast really looked forward to an era of universal illumination, when every mechanic and day labourer would ke a philosopher and choose his department of inquiry. But Lord BtouoirAx, like o';her men, has lived to survive the dream of his earlier life. He is an older man now, he has had more experience, he is less of a zealot. His politicd faith has undergone a considerable change, and t)robably his scientific faith has too. We bo bound to say, now, that, though he dr-es n. it becoming to his own name and repu'i. recognize such levities, he does no . eally operatives, as a general ruhlc. study books of science after their day's wort-, or is in his heart iauch displeas3ed with them for reading novels inaltead. Perhaps there never was a quarter of a century in which science itself has made so much progress as it has in this last one, but in this very period the dreams of scientific men have suffered a great check. No sensible person would talk now as people did at that time about the universal spread of knowledge. The march-ofmind idea, as regards the mwss, has much subsided. The difficolties of education have been brought home to us. We should be only too glad now to secure that all our poor should oply be able to read ; we do not expect them all to become philosophers.
The Court of Assizes of the Seine has terminated its cognizance of the plot against the Emperor of the FBENCH by extending its judgment to the absentees incriminated. Of the culprits actually arrested, TIBALDI was condemned to transportation, and GRni and BARTOLOm to 15 years' imprisonment. MAzziNi, LEDlV-RoLLm, AWskxRNTI, and CAmP.AixLLA were tried according to French forms in their absence, and have now been sentenced to transportation also. The history of this conspiracy, of the trial, and of the evidence our readers have already learnt. There was probably a reality about the business at some point or other, but we can only exprese our most sincere wish that the Emperor NAiorEoN may never be exposred to greater dangers than were created by such projects and accomplices as these. We feel bound, however, on the present occaaion to say that the evidence by which M. MAzzI ha been inculpated in not of such a character as conviCts him of suboming assassin., in the eye of Englishmen. It is impossible to say what a man of such excessive wilfulness, absorbed by a single all-controlling desire, may or may not think lawful for the accomplishment of his de- signs. LM Izzi has already shown plainly enough that he thinks life may be sacrificed without much stint in the attempt to procure for Italy such a political organization as that country has not known since the times of the Itomans. Whether he would hesitate before any other obstacles we cannot pretend to decide, but when a man is accused of a particular crime and brought formally to trial, it is the custom in tbis country to discard antecedent probabilities, and judge him solely by the evidence produced. That evidence in the case now before us would certainly not have procured X MAzzn us conviction, and, as we have expressed freely enough our opinions of his general policy, we give him the benefit of a doubt on the present occasion. We are not called upon to asert his innocence, but the charge, according to English estimate, is at least not proven. It is possible that he may not think himself much indebted to us for this admission, but the guilt which would have attached to him in the event of more complete testimony would have been I of the deepest dye. Murder is the most dreadful of crimes, and we in England can make little discrimination between personal and political motives in the conception of such an offence. Louis NAPOLxoN is regarded, with good reason, as the faithful ally of this country, and we are duly sensible of the extraordinary value of a life representing not only the alliance of France, but the amity of its SovEREIGN. These, however, are but accidental considerations, and our detestation of conspiracy would be just as decided if the relations between the two empires were of a different complexion. We condemn plots, and we abominate murder. If the bullet or poniard of an assassin forms the only instrument by which a design can be promoted, we hold that such a design-whatever its naturecannot be lawfully pursued. We can make no distinctions in this respect between a hankering after a republic and a hankering after a purse. Murder is murder whateTer may be its object, nor can it justify the use of a dagger in the eyes of Englishmen to say that the stroke was intended to clear the way for a chimerical policy in some quarter of Europe. On the contrary, the employment of such means would itself be condemnatory of the end, and the " re" generation," as it is termed, of Italy comes to stink in the nostrils of all honest and honourable people when it appears as the sequel of coldblooded assassination. It ought to carry some instruction to M. MAzzu's mind when he observes the utter absence of sympathy with his views even in this freespoken country. We are sensible enough of the misrule to which Italians have been sub,;eeted, and of the title they may plead to a betber conatitution; but we do not see the practicability of Mf. MizzM-'s Utopia, and, above all, we condemn the unscrupulous obstinacy by which life is expended in the pursuit of an object visionary- even at the best, and certainly unattainable by inch attempts as are made. Devotion to freedom is a laudable passion, but before this approval of the abstract sentiment can be extended to a partieular example we require the purpose to be practicablc, and the agency free from essential guilt. In neither of these respects do M. MAzzr's views give any satisfaction. Of the Italy which he is panting for we can only say that it never yet existed. Italy once held other nations in subjection ; it has since been held in subjection itself; but there has never been a period in the annals of the world at which all the people speaking the Italian tongue were combined in one Italian nation, under a free Government, without asserting dominion over others or accepting it from others over themselves. The break-up of the Roman Empire introduced the Germanic nations to the plains south of the, Alps, and from that time to the present they have never been expelled. In the guise of Goths, or Lombards, or German Enperors, or Austrian Emperors, they have held their footing, and if there was an interval when NZorthern Italy seemed to have escaped fror. the Transalpine connexion it was filled up by a system of small tyrannies, leaving a worse state of things than before, and opening the country to fresh foreign invaders. Probably the acme of Italian freedom may be detected at the moment when the Republics of Lombardy acknowledged indeed the supremacy of the Germanic Crown, but contri-ved to give their vassalage a very endurable form. For the rest the Peninsula was partitioned between the rival Crowns of France and Spain, and in the reprer,entatives of these Royal Houses are its petty sovereignties vested to the present day. The native element in Italian Governments wav confined to a certain ecclesiastical power in Central Italyv, which M. M4zznrn would not be very likely to take for a modeL But, whether a consolidated and Republican Italy be a possibility or not, there can be but one opinion in a country like this as to the menits of a policy which pursues such an object after the manner in which it has been pursued by MlAzzirn. When detachments of unfortunate men are despatched on expeditions palpably hopeless to ine-t the fate of Filibusters or traitors, the -evailin, sentiment is simply one of horror at 'be b`oodshed which ensues, and the eveLr serves not so much to attract sympathy * the cause of freedom as to reconcile "aopiI in some degree even to the very absolutism against which the attempt was directed. There is n.r difficulty in proving that Italians deserve a greater share of constitutional privileges than they possess, but it would be hard indeed to demonstrate that the Italy of M. MA.r-'f s creation would result in any ultimate increase of liberty or security. It can no more be assumed that Italians would accept his united Republic th,n: that Frenchmen would accept the social democracy of MX LoIis BLANC. We know, in fact, that France will not have AL LnDRU RoLLIN and his colleagues, whatever in theory may be the plausibility or attractiveness of their Political creed. Enthusiasts on these subjects are too apt I to forget that it is not enough to prove tie excel- i lence of a constitution upon paper. It is posibNa | for a Government to be extremely democrati, and yet profoundly unpopular. The question is, not what a nation ought to prefer ccording to the deductions of political logic, but what it does prefer as a matter of fact. In these! matters there is no such thing a uniformity of aspirations. M. AL=n does not carry with him i all, or nearly all, even of the liberal parties in, Italy, and it is quite certain that in every country; there will be parties which are not liberal.

THE BEST REORUITS POR OUR INDIAN ARMY. TO TECE EDITOR OF TaE TIM . Sir,-In te pzesent state of our Indan affairs the question is often repeated, "Where shall we find sauicient good soldiers to replee the treachroen Speys 9 Under these circumnees, perhaps I may be permitted to suggest aL plan for recriting which may not yet have been thought of by our authorities Having been for several years I the Netherlands Indian colonies I had au opportunity of there seeing to how great an advantage that Government employ negroes for milita purpotes The amy there Is composed of Europema, Malaya, and negroes, tbe twro latter of oourse commanded by European offlcers. The Europeans a; a, to a great extent, such of all countries wbo, either from despair or other causes best knowsn to themselves, prefer being as frfrom home as possible. A vey lage proportion are addicted to drink, and this, with a natural inclintion to catch the fevers and diseases of a tropic9s climate, so ungenial te European constitutions, soon weakens, and but too oftendestroys them In a few months aftertheirarrival merethan half ther number have perished. The Malaya are of course lss exposed to such malignantin&snces being Mahomedans they are temperate as regards drin, but mostly addicted to the baneful use of opium, of the consequences of which it is uxuecessary to Et Although the Malay Is generally vwry tractable and enduring, still he waants physical strength, and, as a matten of course, also, the moral courage and valour of the strong. Being a believer in predestination, he does no' fear death much, at least not as much as the pain of beingwounda& Annually numbers of them are hung-n&y, weekly axaost, there are executions of Malay soldiers for insubordiation, theft, "ranning amokh" (one of the aany horrid consequences of smoking opiam), &c. The nagro, on the othor hand, com. bines every desirable good quality for a soldier. He is weU accustomed to a tropical clmate and to as fragal living as any Orientas, and consequently does not suffer from the climate a9 the European evef will. He is at least quite as sthletic and powverful as an European, nod as enduring, if not more so, than either Malay or Bindoo. He is devoted and sincerely atiached and faithful to his offii cers-of course under just and kind treatment. He will deprive himself of everything to sezve his officer and is obedient and tractable. Dnaiag nearly four years I have never heazd of a single instance of a negro having been punished for misdemeanour, while it is a dAily occurrence among the European and Milay soldiers The negro is brave to a fault, and regardless of any danger. He adores his fetish, and if permitted, a in.Java, to follow his religion undisturbed by missionary intrusions, there is not the slightest fear of his ever becominil disaffected. Pntting aside the impossibily that he ever could have the same sympathies or interests as the Sepoy regarding ludia, the negro emulates his European felow soldier every tbing, and his greatost pride i to he considered " black European." The negro, at least, nsver has been k-nown to sho" the slight st rnclination to sympathire with. either MnLay or Ohtinasa; why then. should he prefer the flindoo? Bnttheobief thing is nol to interfere withthdtr religion, and that I suppose is, one chief reason WIhy in Java,wherh the missionaries aenot piamittec to molest the soldiers, they hale always been content and faithft *Wby not, then, omploy the b2ss troops for our East Indian oolonies (bai not for the oWst idian), that can axywhece be found, w,l which are to be had for the troub3b oF fitching them ? Frasre recraita fre negroes for her calonies for agricultnal, and HoUa.ladces the same for militsyprposes. Havs the Governmant of England not the power to do the saw? or do they fear the cry that some mistakon philanthro,ts will rais agains suh proceedalms? The negroes are to be recruited as fairly as Frane aud Holland do asc which is ouite as fair a way, if not more so, than that in which reernits are procured at home.J Athough I do sot flatter n3self that these hints wlle ever be acted upon or esen notioed by those who have the authority arnt power of doing so, stil I am sure that these ge50ntlemen esess sufficent patriotism and willonegresg to act upon tese suggestiou8 should they be deemed expedient. Sepoys might he transferred to the Cape and the West IndIn colonies, where negroes would be less trustwort.y, and thereby enibe Government to reduoe considerably tbe number of mors expensive European trooPs in tbe-e arts u ev giooe under our dominion.

i SECOND EDITION - THE TIMES&OFFICE, Priday Morning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS; Tho following is the letter of our Paris corre, apondent, dated yesterday (Thursday), 6 p.m.:- The Swirs papers bring confirmation of the sttement already sent to you, that the gravty of the dispute between Vaud and the Federal Council had been exaggerated, and that it was untrue that a levy of troops had been ordered in that canton to prevent the continuance of the wlorks on ths Oron line of railray. Viewed by the light of the most recent advice, received, the question loms much of the ;mportance that was at first given to it, and, although not yet settled, it will, doubtless, be soon brought to a satisfactory termination by the good sense and moderation of the Federal and Cantonal Governments. The article in Tuesday's Times on Lord Stratford de Redcliffe has attracted a great deal of attention here, first when a telegraphic despatch gave as its substance that it demanded the recall of that Ambassador and M. Thouvenel, and, afterwards, whem it reached Paris at full length. N,early all this morning's papers extract and comment on it; but, while cordially agreeing with any amount of blame that may be cast on Lord Stratford, and ready joyfully to hail his recall as the remoral of a constant source of discord and diplomatic squabbles, they protest against the recall of the French Amr batsador, and are puzzled, or profes to be so, to understand on what grounds it should be advocated. Only one or two of them nadmit that they eize ithe real motive of the suggestion,namely, that, by removing them both, " old animo. sities and bad traditions" would be broken through, and the ground would be cleared for a franker and less vexatious system of diplomacy than that which for a long time peat has prevailed at Constantinople. On the other hand, to replace Lord Stratford and It. Thouvenel for any length of time by charg6s d'affaires, whose diplomatic rank would not entitle them to direct communication with the Sultan, would be to give the Ambassadors of other Powers an advantage in this respect over the representativex of England and France. The Univers yesterday commenced a sers of articles on the Indian insurrection, which, as far as they have yet gone, fully maintain, if they do not augment, the reputation already acquired by that journal for want of common sense and bitter hatred of England. Fortunately, the venom of the Universis of no very dangerous descrption; were its effects as virulent as the animus -with which it is emitted, England would long since have been annihilated, and the earth purged of heretics-of all those, at least, who refused forthwith to abjure their errors, and embrace the gentle doctrines of which M. L la Veuillot is the propounder. Viewing everything through the same spectaces, and carried to mad estremes by its msniapf proselytism,thetUltramontane, journal has long s*ee discredited itself in France by its extravagant viefrs and enormous bigotry. Itg Parisian contemnpories rarely condescend to argue with it seriously, and, indeed, to do w is mere loss of time. In the present instance, however, one or two of them tal* it to task, expressing themselves in terms of strong disapprobation. This is in reply to its yesterdays article, which is quite outheroded by the egregious folly of that published today. One is not surprised to hear the Univers declare that if England loses India it will be in consequence of the Reformation, and that had she re. msined Catholic she would have preserved her Eastern possessions. That is only in accordanee with the usual strain of the priegtly periodicaL But one is certainly rather astonished to learn that now her only hope of retaining the empire that is on the point of escaping from her grasp is by applying to France for assistance, 'he Univers foresees the time when, her stor4 of fighting men exhausted, she will seek the aid of her ally, and then conditions must be imposed upon the suppliant. In return for the soword that shall re-establish her Power in the East she must quit the Mediterranean. The Ionian Isles must be joined to Greece, Malta must revert to France, which posgesses, in Northernx Africa, " another India, less rich, but healthier than that of the English-an agricultural and military empire, which France will not hold a century without filling it with a Christian people." When Gibraltar is restored to Spain, France may fairly, in return for this service, take posesion of the Baleario Islands, which are on the way to. Algeria. " Malta, in the hands of France, becomes for Latin Europe a sure barrier against the East, andA gives to the Holy Places and to t3he GatholIc interests in that part of the world a protection. whieh ceases to be iUusory." But, without further following up the rhapsodies of the Unitsrs, I will briefly quote the D&ats and the Si&ld. The Debats says:- " The Univers to-day prophesies, with text f Sriptur the fall of England, and declares her samnaoned to th; judgment of God. ' They lashed Catholic truth,' says bbUniwem^' with the prosperity of England. See (they said) if not Protestant Englard the freest, the richest, the Atromgest notion in the world? They can no longer use this argument since England lis condemned to perish.' '-Tot a little,' says the Unira, 'and we shall lese often hear it sked what England would have gained by remaining Ca&_ tholic? She would have gained this-shn-would have mado herself in India a solid empire, and she would not bave been overthown at a blow, samefuly hustled (&owqcuWcc.)'`beCat hardly dcnsssuchabg, t ents,attiredinaxchl ngnletus however, point out to tM Unirers that ita prophetic ardonu. makes it lose signt of the past, and of fbe lessons of history.

Major Knox), being about to join his regiment, now on its way to the scene of carnage in India, has issued the following spirited address to his coastituents. This is the second time the gallant officer has had a similar duty to perform. On the breaking out of the Crimean war Major Knox appealed to the electors for leave of absence, which was as freely granted then as it will no doubt bg now, at a no less imminent crisis in the affairs of England:- " Gentlemen,-It is so short a time since you kindly sanctioned and approved the step I took in volanteering my services for the Crimea that it ig with confidenoe I now inform you that my regiment has received sudden and unexpected orders to embark for India. "I am persuaded that, under present circumstances, you vill agree vith me that I have only course to pursue, and that were I to hesitate I should be unworthy of your confidence and forgetful of my own honour. " The events that have recently oecurred in Bengal have caused the greatest indignation throughout the empire, and there is but one opinion expressed, that it is the duty of the Government, at whatever cost, to put down the mxtiny, reestablish British authority, and avenge the cruelty and murder perpetrated on helpless women and children by miscreants who have forgotten not only their allegiance, bat also their humanity. "It is httle more than five months since you unanimously elected me for the fourth time as your representative, and I feel that on the present occasion it is only necessary for me to appeal to the electors of Dangannon to receive their sanction; and if it be the will o a hizher Power that I should return, I hope still to be all-wed to watch over the interests of yourancient and loyal borough. 1' The shortness of the time, as well as L seVer accident, prevents my calling on you personally; but I take leave of you, both individually and collectively, witb every feeling of regard, and with every wish for your prosperity and h*plplness.

THE INDIAN Af-UTINIBS. We continue to publish from the numerous letters forwarded to us by the friends and relatives of offiers in India such as contain any new details or matter of particular interest. PESHAWUR. The follOwing ane extracts from letters from Lieutenant-Colonel Edwardes, C.B., dated from June 21 to July 6:- ehwr 'sPeshawar. "As yet we have made no inpression on Delhi. G[enrl Bead'a, or rather General Barnard's, foro was too weak to besiege Delbi, And has had to stop and wait for reinforce. ments just As General Whish had at Moolta. The rebels far exceed him ia numbers and in gns. The numbers are of little consequence, for disorganized ftragments of rebel regimemts never can contend suooefully with the gerried battalions of a well-appointed army led by English officers. But it is a aerious matter to have 150 pleces of artillery (taken out of our own magadne) playing upon our camp. Engagements take place every two or three days, and wo are easily victorious in the open field. The ausmy loses hundreds in every skirmish, and the heaps of dead are remplandered by our soldiers of all the plunder they had secre round their waiste. We loee very few men or offioers. But we don't get into Delhi, and the delay damages onr reputation, and encourages the belief, arhtflly disseminated by the Brahmins and Moollahs, that 'all prophecies agree that the Englsh rUle is now to end 0 So the deluded people rise here and thero, and add to the anarchy and oonfusion. We trnst that 20,000 soldiers are now embarking from England, but they cannot reach till September, and you may judge what has to be endared and done during the intervening months. There never was anything a hundredth part so serious in India before. This post, so far from being more. arduous in future, will be more socure. Events here have taken a wonderful turn. During peace Peehawur was an inoesant anxiety. Now it is the strongest point in India. We have struck two great blows-we have disarmed our own troops, and raised levies of aU the people of the country. The troops ae oonfounded; they calculated on being backed by the people. The people are delighted, and a better feeling has Bping up between them and us in this enlist ment than has ever been obtained before. I have alo called on my old country, the Deragmt, and it is quite delightful to see how the call is answereed 2,000 horsemen, formerly in my army at mooltan, are now moving on different points, according to order, to help us in this difficulty, and every poet brings me remonstrances from Chiefs as to why they have been forgotten. What fault bave they committed that they are not sent for ? This is reaUy gratifying. It is the heart of a people. It does one good all through. The Pesha'wurees had often heard that I had been grateful in getting revards for my foUowers after the Mooltan war; but they were not prepared to see sach a demonstration from the other end of the Soolimanee Mountain It excites their better feelings, and will do them good too. Allyester4ay I was busy fitting out 700 horse and foot levies (Mooltanee) to roinforce Nicholson at Jullandhur. How all the liberality shown to these McOltanees after the war of 1848.9 is now repaid, in the alacrity with which they rush to our side again to help us I They are Ow ianvaluable, and so glad to se me again; it is quite a pleasn re in the midst of this howling wilderness." LUCKNOW. The following are extracts from letters received from the Chaplain, the Rev. I. S. Poloha-mpton, M.A., late Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford - " Lucknow, May 12. S . .i Snce I wrote to you last wo have had a little excitement in the station. I told you about Dr. Well's bugalow being burnt down, and that it was supposed to be done by the Sepoys in revenge for his tastiag a bottlc of medicine In the hogpitaL Well, a day or two after I wrote, the whole of the huts of the Sepoys of tile 13th Regiment were burnt, it was supposed by accident, bht, from after events, that seems rather doubtful You may imagine that hut3 with thatched roofs for 1,000 men made a pretty good blaze. Last Sunday week it was my turn to take the evening service at Cantonment Church. There was an unusuaUy thin congr6gation. To. wards the end of the prayers a servant came into church, and spoke first to Major Bird, of the 48th, and then to Mr. Dashwood, of the same regiment. They both went out, and afterwards others were called away. I began to think that some more houses had been set on fire, but of course I went on with the service. The ladies began to look very uncomfortable; one or two went out of church, one or two others crossed over the aile to friends whe were sitting on the other side. Altogether I had not a very attaztive congregat,lon. After service we found thtt the 7th Irregular Infantry, 1,000 strong, quartered at the Moos& Bagh, had mutinled, and that th e 71st, 48th, 7th Cavalry, and a troop of English ArtiUery, with six gans, had gone to queUl them. This was the cause of the officers being calUed out of church. The 32d Queen's, as I afterwards found, also marched to the Moosa Bagh, and an Irregular Cavalry Regiment, so that no less thau 3,500 men marched to pat dowrn the mutiny. I felt very much incli ned to ride down myself to see what was going on, but as the Mooea Bagh Is seven miles from our house, and as I should have left my wife aU alone, I stayod where I was. I thought of what William IlL said vhan he Nsaa told that the Bishop of Derry had been shot at the ford at the battle of the Boyne, ' What took him there ? However, if so strong a force had not been sent that the mutineers were completely overawed, there might have been work for me to do. I heard all about what took place from Sir Henry Lawrence and one of the artillery officers. Sir H. Lawrence went himself, as the highest civil authority. When the troops arrived there -somewhere about 9 'clock p.m., a bright moonlight night (the 7th)-the mutineers were ordered out; so out they came. They had gone to their huts. Their mutiny consisted in refusing to use some c artridges which had been given them, because they thought that they were greased with English fat. Theyalsothreatenedtoshootoneoftheirofficers. Well, the mutineers were drawn up in line, and Sir Henry Lawrence went forward and harangued them, and then retired to the neighbourhood of the six cannon which were drawn up in front of the mutineers. The officer commanding tho artillery askei him if he should give orders to load, he said, ' Yes ;' so they loaded with grape. In loading, one of the artillrymen anticipated the next order, and lighted the match for firing the cannon. The mutineers no sooner saw this than they imagined that they were going to be fired upon, and immediately they dung down their muskets and ran for their lives, and the 7th Cavalry after them, to bring them back. So ended the mutiny, happily wlthout bloodshed; but this certainly would not have been the case had not to strong a force been taken against them that they had no chauce. Ninety of their muskets were found to be loaded. The Irregular Regiments here were in the King's service bofore the annexation, and they are no' of course, in such a state of discipline as the Regulars. Sir' HL Lawrence told me that it was a mercy there was not a shot fired. If there had been there would have been no stopping a fight, and the unfortunate mutineers would have been regularly massacred. Another most absurd story they hAve got hold of. This came on in the examination of some of the mutlneers before Sir H. Lawrence. They say that in consequence of the Crimean war there are a great m any widows in England, and that these are to be bronght out and married to the Rajash in Oade, and that their children, brought up as Christians, are to inherit aU the esta tes ! The natives are like hables-they wil believe anything. However, Sir Henry looks very serions over the pr esent state of affairs. No doubt the friends of the King of 0n do will make all *oe plots they can, and give the Government no end ot trouble. I don't believe there will be a rising in Lucknow, but I know that the natives, many of them, wish it, and that our commanders here haTe prepsared for It The officers of the 32d QUeen's are not allowed to step away from the messbouse, as they formerly were, so that they may be ready at a momenes notice.

And thus it is all over Ina. Or governent in this oountry is the most wonderful thing in the history of the world; we re not one to a hundred of the inhabitants, nor anything like it. Our strength Ewder God, whose hand I think oes may plinly we in our gorerning this immense country lies in the disunica of its inhabitants, their being divided into Mahm saans and Hindoos, whc hate one another with the. deadliest of all enmities-the proverbia odium Uaeolo-,curs.

The Qe's Regiment in the city has been reinforced by a troop of Native Artiery. It is unfortunate that they are so far from cantonments (five mile6), and the natives nmight, by barrioading Lucknow, nir-ke their progress here very slow If not impossibl.e. I k 4 4bt Bigajor who Br friend of mine, why they had not nt heg Artil t relnforoe the 324 t He id, ' Because in can of !ntir they are all we have to defend us h'ere. We think the Native Artillery will i truo wha-tevr happens, but to provide aganst their trchery a soldier from the 32d has been appointed to each 'gu, who, if he sw anything going wrong, Would give warning to thoregiment, and they would instantly shoot the zutineers. It is also Intended to hxae a company of the 32t up here to protect the English Artillery in emm of a row. If the Artillery are well protected, no doubt they rould give a good account of the Sepoy regiment, should ieY mutiny; but if not protected by EnLh soldiers ther 'ould be done for in caso of a mutiny. Thero are only 90 of them. However, I don't anticipate any worse oonsequenoes than havo alreawy happened. The mutiny has spread from Station to station, and, having been put down at' each, has, I think, ceased. I think we have had our share here, aad 'have remoon to be most thankful that things were no worse, but time will show. I learned that in the night some natives had gone to Captain Hayes, the military secretar, and hadtold him thatpartleg had been appo4tedinthe three Sepoy Regiments to go round to murder nus'a, in our beds, and set the houses on fire. Captain Hyes, not knowing whether this wu true or not, thought it wise to take all the precautions ho could; so he ent to Colonel Inglis (as I understood) for help, and he sent at once a regiment of Native Cavalry, and the 32d started from the city for cantonments before daybreak. C- also told me that the 32d bave completely left their backs in the city, hospital and alL The sick have been brought to the Residency, so have the women, and the Reiddency is garrisoned by 130 men of the 32d, and by the battery of Native Artillery. AI' the ladies, wives of civilians, who live in different parts of the city, have come into the Residency. Some are staying at Mr. Gabbines, some at Foyne's, some at Mr. Ommaney's, c.By the ResidencyI ,meanapioc.of gioun a good deal elevated above the rest of the city, allotted by the King of Oude, when he first put himself under British ' protection' some 50 years ago, to the British civil residents. It is walled round almost entirely; on one side native housea abut upon it, but On the other three sides it is tolerably clear. Roads without gates in some places coDnect it*ith the city, but it is not at lla bed place ,to make a stand, certainly the beet in Lucknow, to which it is a sort of ' Acropolis.' Thg Residency contains the Chief Commisdoner's house, Mr. Gubbinass, Mr. Ommaney's, Foynes, the poet-offie, city hospital, electric telegraph-office, the church (last Dot least), &c. You Will perhaps Bay 'Why did not all the 32d garrison this place, and the rest of the English retire toit?' illtellyou. Wed on'tthinkthedisaffectedinthe city are likely to rise unless they know that they wiUl be bcked by the Native Infantry Regimenta, Now, if aU the 32d had gone into the Residency, there wouldhave been no power to keep the three Native Infintry regiments in check. But now that the 32d and Englislx Artillery are In cantonments the three Native In fantry regiments know that if they mutiny they wil have' to meet the 324 and Artillery; and though they are five to. one and have Artillery thenselves (for there Is an Irregular battery besides those I have mentioned), yet they have a' wholesome dread of the Eaglish. They know that we have beaten thom 10 or 20 to one before nor. Well, now, I ion't think you need alarm yourself for us. you see, the Native Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery are kept in check. hero by the 32d and English Artillery, so that they cannot effect a junction with the city people without a fight for it, and they have no stomach for that unless they are sure of being able to murder al before them, or are led by their English officers, who of course would all leve them. The English in the Residency are tolerabl well protected by their position and garrison, and above all we must hope and trust that that overroling Providence which ha so long enabled' U8, one to a thousand, to govern this country Will not. desert us now. At church I said the prayer il time of war and tumults, and so, having in publio and private committed ourselves into God's hands, and taketn all possible precaution, w6e camly and fearlessly await the result. 3y opinion is that in a few days a terrble example will have been maro of the Delhi insurgents, and this, and the precautions taken, will show the natives that it is their wisest plan to keep stilL I had eervice in the city church; it was very fairly attended. After it was over Schilling, the principal of the Martiniere, asked me what he thought he had better do. The Mrtinlere is a mile out of Lucknowr, on the opposite gide of cantonments. There ar about 80 boys boarding there, eight masters, and two sergeants. There is a guard there of six Sepoys, but the worst of it is we don't know how soon our guards may turn upon us. r advised him as a matter of precaution to get some muskets and anmunition. We went first toMr. Gubbins, who thought with me, and then I drove Schilling down to cantonments, and we 'went to Sir Henry Lawrence. He offered to give him a Iarger guard, but I sid ' No; if we can't trust the guard the smaller it is the better. We want to arm ourselves lest they should turn upon us.' So Sir H. Lawrence gave him an order for 12 mnuskets and ammunition, and gave him authority to command the guard, who previously were under one of their own men. So Schilling drove off in my buggy, and I have not heard from him since. He intended to have al the boys and masters in the main building, aud distribute the sim Sepoys as much as possible. The house iu very strong; it was built by General Martin for a palace for the king. There is only one vay to the upper part of the main building, up a nariFo* taix`cab, -where half .dozen resolut men might ddfehd tVhetseltes for a week. All this precaution may seem almost absurd, but what has happened at Moerut and Delhi shows us that it is necessary. Indeed, if there were anything like union among the natives and a clever man at their head, all that we could do probably wobld not prevent our all being cut off to a man, and the English would have to reconquer the country. Things throughout India never looked so serious. It may all come to an end soon, and the country be more tranquil than ever, or we may all be murdered in a week. I think it will be the former. Whatever happens cannot be withoat the will of God, and 'Heaven,' as the old sailor said, 'is as near us here as at home.' To show you bow serious people in authority think the state of affairs, the other day, after the mutiny in the 7th Irregalars had been put dowrn, I said laughingly to Sir Henry Lawrenee, ' Why, Sir Henry, you may havo some work cut out for you now before you go home.' He said, very gravely, ' I can assure you it is no laughing matter.' I heard Celoeel Inglis say the same thing to a man who was incllned to be too jocular yesterday. " Yesterday evening I went, at 6 o'clock, to the 3W, to give them Divine service. I found them enchmped in iX 2an9go tope about 20D yards from my house. Poer fellows, there they had beenin tents allday, the hotwind blowing, and the tbermometer at 110! Colonel Inglis had been to. us in the aftermcon to ask us to give up our house for the soldiers.

Mr. W. H. RI , OnTTGHAx.-This gentleman gave his thrilling narrative of the campaign in the Crimea in the Nottingham Exchanee-rooms on Wednesda evening Lut to a highly respectable audienoe, among whic, were some of the most influential families of the town and neighbourbood. His intoresting and eloquent address was listened to with the moat inared attention, and frequently drew forth well-merited applause. The narrative of the chre of the Light Brigade It Balaldava and the foerful conlct at Inkermann was enthuiastically received. THln RECPiT FAruRS si BRISTOL.-Meetings were held yesterday of the cfdltors of AMr. Aaron Crossfield, general merchant of Bristol, and Ef Messr H. Farden and Co., of the Stoke soapworks, near Bromagrove, whose failures were mentiontd in Thle Tiaws of Mondt. From the statement submttted by Messs Barnard, Thomas, and Co., the accohtants, it appeared that the liabilities of Mr. Crossfield were 7,64" 17s. 7d., besideg huix under discount amounting to upwards of 3,0001. The asets are stated at 5,5551 7s. a An assignment was proposed, and was agreed to by nearly all the croditors. In the estate of Messrm Farden and Co., the ascertained liabilities are 2E,331. 19s. lId., besldde upwards of 5,0001. in bills under discount The assets re only 5,8981 2s. 9d. It appeared fromn the statement su bmitted that the firm had in curred losses amountini to 18,093L sinoe the year 1854. In this case it was determined that an assignment should be Immediately executed, or the 'matter will be at onoe takert to the Bankruptcy Court. OnR ir FitANcE.-The Court of Assizes of the Jura three days ago tried a married woman named Juge and her two children by a former husband, Charles Dejeux, aged 17, and Alexandrine Dejeux, aged 15, for murder. After the womau's marriage to Juge, who was a labourer of VieiUeLoye, she manifestod a profound aversion for his three children by a former w,ife, deprived them of sfficieat food aud clothing, beat them repeatedly in the most savage manner, and more tban once had turned them out of doors barefooted to beg in the midst of winter. After a while two of the little creatures died. On the third of April the third child, whose name was 1Emilie, and who was only eight lears of ge, arrived at the house of a man named Lnce, at Grosmisson, a village at some distance from Vielle-Loye, and begged of him to take her in, as she was suffering dreadfuly in her stomaoh. He received the cbild, and she told him that her step-mother had five days before sent her out to beg in the adjacent vlagees with Chaules and Alexandrine, and had at the sme time told those two to take care not to let her return home; that Charles and Alexandrine had beaten her almost continually, and when she was too fatigned to walk had dragged her along after them; and that at last they had foroed her to drink water and eat bread which had a bitter taste, and which had caused her dreadful pains in the stomach. A few bours after this the child died. Her body having been eramined by a medical man, it wa found that she had died from phosphorouj, which had been administered in water and bread. No one but the boy and the girl had been with her at the time the poison must have been administered; but it seemed certain that they had acted by order of tbeir mother, and besides, It was ascertained that the woman had shortly before purchased phosphors. The jury declared all three " guilty,' and the Court sentenoed the woman to death, the lad to 20 years hard labour, andthe girl to be confined for 20 years in a house of oorrection The Court of Asszee of the Obe was yesterday occupied in trying two men named Franvois and Gomot for an attempt at murder and for burglary. The attempt at murder was related in the Messenger at the time it occurred. As hI. Bigot, of Plessis-Betville, was driving in his gig on the 4th of July through the wood of Borest, on his return home from Sen4l he perceiaed two men by the roadside, and when he got up to them one of them fired a_gun at him; the charge, consisting of slugs, knocked of7hishat and slightly wounded him in the head The two men were about to rush on him, when he whipped up his horse and got clear off. He notioed that one of the men had bandy legs, and saw sufficient of the other to describe his person, The next day the two men were arrested, and one of them (Gomot) confessed not only that they hadattempted to murder the notary; with the intention of robbing him, but that they had a day or two before broken into two houses at Fontaine les-Cornu and stolen 60f. in money, a gtu, and some other articles ; also, that they had committed a burglary near Scnlls; and, lastly, that they had contemplated murdering a village postm;n, in order to rob him, bUt had a stained from the fear that he might not have suc,ent money on him to make It wrorth 'while. The jury declared them guilty, and the Court sentenced both to death. rR'ntE Am Lo 1 Or Lv riN HoLno1IN.-Yeete1%. day Ar. T. Wakley resamed, for the sixth time, at the olborn lJnion the inqurry respecting the deaths of Mr. WVilliam Chappie and Jobn Thomas Bolfe, 'wshich took place in consequence of a fire in the premises of Mr. Maidmont5 saddler and harness-maker, No. 14, Hligh Holborn, on thes 27th of July last. Further evidence having been given, the jury returned a verdict that the deaths of the deceesed persons were oceasioned by a fire in the premises o No 14 High Holborn, in the occupation of Mr. G haidmont; but whether the sid fire ws accidentally or ilflly caused the criminal aot of some person or persons unknown there i no evidence to show.

fONY-MA KTr a7d G'ITY A't '4LIJt,]BN^CX Thursday Evening. The English funds remain dull. Consols for money opened at yesterday's qtutatnji-9o0 to X, and subsequently touched 904. The clksing transactions were at 90N for money, and 9' l;J fur the 14th of October. Money was in deniaud both in the Stock-Exchange and in the diacount-inarket at 5i per cent., and there were some applications at the B3ank for advances on Governmernt ecuirities. India Stockleftoffat210to 212; Idida Bonds, 23s. to 17B. discountt; and Exchequer. blils, 7s. to 3s. discount. Foreign stocks also have been rather flat, Peruvian especially showing a dechlne uf i. The transactions in this market still contnuue limited, and prices generally are weaker. L3rizilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 102 aud 102i; ditto, 1829 and 1839, 101; Buenos Ayres, 84; Mexican, for the account, 21i and i ; Peruvian Foar-anda-Half per Cents., for the account, 79; PortuLguese, 45$; Spani-sh, 4q, I-, and a; ditto), nev Deferred, 25i; Turkish Six per Cents., 9.i3; ditto, for the account, 95 J and i; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 99a. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 70c. for money, and 67f. for the end of the month, showing in the former case a decline of an eighth. The operators for a fall, it is said, have had the market at their command, owing to the absence of the leading men of business from the capital, and little improvement seems to be anticipated even by the most sanguine until October. A report that the Orleans Company were about to issue new shares, which had itcreased the general deprension, is stated to be without foundation. The new tax upon transfers which is to come into operation next month is ill understood, and contributes to the prevailing dissatisfaction. The increase in the bullion of the Bank of France also is understood to be much less than was at one time alleged. It is now said to be only about 100,0001. or 120,OOl., and this has been from large artifical purchases. On the other hand, the accounts regarding the results of the harvest appear to exceed the best anticipations. The private letters from Paris tate that the recent difficulties in connexion with the management of the Crddit Mobilier have been smoothed over. AL. Ernest Andre, the director by whom upon the refusal of his colleagues to accept hias resignation a notarial notice of withdrawal had been issued, has been induced to return, while the other directors, who were understood to be desirous of getting out, have for the present, at all events, abandoned their intention. This result was to have been expected, since the auspices under which the establishment was formed were such as to forbid the idea of its being allowed to break up from any internal dissensions that would admit of being healed by superior influences. The financial world inay also be congratulate1I on the turn the affair has taken, It was on public grounds only that the institution was to be viewed with dmafavour; and now that the eyes of all persons must have been opened to the unsound character of its original pretensions, and its dangerous power has consequently been dissipated, there could be no other feeling than one of regret at witnessing any individual disasters that might attend its change of condition. The hope must be that it will gradually bring its shareholders to be content with conmparatively humble dividends, and that, instead of aspiring to regulate and monopolize the enterprise of the empire, it will recognize that no extraordinary gains cau be continuously made without extraordinary gambling, an(d that it had better accept the opportunity of quietly conducting its affairs on the safe old principles current before banks of Credit Mobilier were ever heerd of. It was announced this morning that the submarine cable to connect the Islaud of Sardinia with Algeria and bring France into direct communication with that colony has been safely laid. The length of the line is 146 statute miles, and the amount of cable paid out about 172 miles. The cable has four wires, two of which will be appropriated to the French Government, and its contract price was 50,0001. The undertaking has been carried out by the Medi terranean Company, by whom the first part of the line-namely, from Genoa to Corsica and Sardiniahad been previously completed. They have a capital of 300,0001. and a guaranteed rate of interest from the Sardinian and French Governments. Messrs. Newall and Co. were the manufacturers. The African mail steaTaer Gambia to-day has brought about 12,0001. of gold. At a meeting of the Submarine Telegraph Company to-day, Sir James Carmichael in the chair, the report and accounts were unanimaously adopted, anid a dividend declared for the past half-year at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum. A memorandum of an agreement with the North of Europe Telegraph Company for the disposal of the Hanoverian concession was read, and after some discussiou approved. By this arrangement the latter company will repay the caution money deposited, and preliminary expenses, about 7,0001. in all, and upon the completion of the telegraph will be associated with the Submarine Telegraph an(d the Societ Carmichael et Compagnie upon termns:of partnershipaimilar to those which exDst at present between the two latter companies. It.wms objected that the lastcondition was at variance with the spirit of the original resolution, which gave the option only of consolidating the dividends upon certain conditions, but the chairman explained that it had been found necessary to make the alteration, in order to join a company having concessions of 20 and 25 years to run, a course which was the more advisable as the original concessions were getting shorter. Annexed is an abstract of the report:- The submarine cables of the joint companies have continued in perfect working order since the repairs of the accidents which occurred in January. The llritish and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company have completed the renewals and repairs to the land lines from London to Dover, and the whole of the wires therefore, both submarine and subterranean, are now and bave beon for somne time past in perfect working order from London to Calais and from London to Ostend. The accident to the company's cables, referred to in the last report, caused the loss of nearly a month's tiafbo and its subsequent diversion. for a more oonsiderable period to other routes, yet notwithstanding this serious drawback the revenue of the last half-year has exceeded that of the half-year ending December, 1856, by 2841. This is the muore gratifying when it is considered that during the samie period a large reduc. tion in the pnices of messages to Fnramce, Spain, Switzerland, &c., has taken place, and that in consequence of this reduction the com"any for a short time sustained a lots upon its traffio, wbich had to be worked up durzig the latter portion of the half-year. The directors have been at consi. dorable pains to establish direct services, and messages are now generally forwarded to most of the cbief towns of Europe without retesmision tbrough any intermediate office. The business of the company for the month of July last, and up to the present timne, shows a considerable augmentation over the corresponding montbs of 1856. The directorshave deternined that a noiety of the amount expended in repair'ing the cables should be charged against revenue, and that the remaining portion of the costs incurred sbould betaken out of the reserved fund sCcrning during the present year; there w.tberef ore, beeonly theadditional sum of 851. to be deducted from the amount that may be set aside during toe current half-year. The amunut of the preseut reserve fund wiU therefore remain intsct. The total expended ou tho repairs was 1,5271. The amount of the reserved fund to be appropriated for the half-year is 5921. for both companies, and it is proposed to take 3751. from revenue, making a total of 9671., wbich, deducted from the gross expense incurred, leavves 5(51). to be carried over to the succeeding half-year. After meeting the above deductions there remains sulficient to pay a dividend of 7 per cent., leaving a balance of 216t." At a special meeting to-day of the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Conmpany the available profit was stated to amount to 6781., out of which a dividend of 5s. per cent. was declared. The aubjoined relates to the desirableness of f3cilitating the aubstitution of checks for bank-notes in certtain mercantile payments -where the latter are till insisted upon - " Sir,-In the course of business transactions in London a merchant bas frequently occasion to pay money where the receivers decline to take checks, raLd require bank-notes or specie. I would name as an instaice the payment of India bills ander discounLt in the haxds of institutions having branches in the East. ' The present system is bad, not only becanFe it exposes elerks to unnecessary temptation, but also because it compels their employers to incur the risk of loss from thieves and pickp ockets, or from the carelessntess of the young man while it 1S being carried to its destiR,ati,n. " I am surprised that a very simple plan in vogue in the United States has never been adopted here. 1 mean the certifying' of checks, as it is called. The check is preaented at the bank there to the order of the receivers, here It would, probably, be crossed instead. If the account is good for it one of the paying ceshiers writes his nam oa it, or rmerely afflxes his initials, wb-ch is tantamount to paying it, as the bank thereby enegages 4oraqnour it. " Thea. signaturecef As var6uts-hiers are well known among banks and bankers, and the receiver In taking a 'certitied' check knows that he gets Tbe security of the bank on whieh it is drawn, wbich ia s good to htbLLt, the money. I may mentien that it is usual ft,r the samhier of the bank on which it is drawn to enter the amount, aDd in es-timating the po5tion of any accoumt the bum is looked npon ase paid. 'By this system all risk of the money being misapproptiated er falling into wrong banlds tY obviaced, and I think that you will agree wish me in recommending its adoption here.

INLAND STEAM NA VIGATION IXr BENGAL. TO THE ED1TOR OF THE TMES. Slr,-Were the public to judge from the published worrspondence of the Manchester Chaimber of CoDmerce, the remarkg lately made at a meeting at Iaverpool, and b. tho swond report of the directr of the Orienta Inland Steam Company, they might fairly conclude that nothing bad hitherto been done In promoting inland steam naviption in India. The lid of pssengers gion in your Calcutta corre. spondent's lotter, dated July 20, published in Thc Tima of the 7th ibt., shows that the steamers and barges of the Ganges Steam and Inland Steam Navigation CompAny have been " rendering important serrioe in the present cri6s; and it may be stlfactory to know that these vessei were expeditlously transporting European troops up the country. By a letter to my address, dated [Calcutta, 17th of July, from the manager, I learn that the 3IizzApore Steamer conveyed a portion of the Mdram Puilefrs from Calcutta to Allahabad (800 rmles) in 17 days; the sawe vessel and the Benares, both belonging to the Ganges Steam Company, each having a lr8e iron brge attached, were engaged to convey troops and stores to Aliliabad; and, as the river had become more easily ravigable In consequence of rain, it is remonable to suppoce the voyage would be made in 14 days. General Hvelocks foce would Dot therefore be long without support. Had the Government iu England despatched 10 soldiers to Bombay or Calcutta as second. clas or deck psengers by eah of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamers twice a-month, and their arival been publicly notified, the moral effect would have been excellent. It is not yet too late to adopt this mode of peedy transport, partioulrly a regards Bombay. Yours obediently, ATLEX. BEATTI hLD.

rBON SMIPS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Slr,-I have recently een two lette in your paper, com. menting on the remark which had been made by Sir James Elphinstone In a letter to you, that he hoped the accident which had happened to the Transit would open the eyes Of the Firs Lord of the Admiralty to the defecte of iron troop ships Now, I *pprehend Sir James does not mean to oordema the employment Of iron ships for carying troops, but rather to cal attentIon to the very defective principle upon which iron vsels are bult. If properly constructed, they urely re anot leas efficient than wooden ships for employ mert ahtrnsports orforpurpoe of trsde. It is to the acknowledged defects in the principle of construction alone that any o'lection can !Is, and as iron shipbuilding is now largely extending it is high time more general attention wa directed to this subject. Hundreds of iron screW steamers re at this moment being built in different parts of the idngdom, and I cannot learn that any improve. ment in the prineiple of construction has been introduced; Vertical framing, Innumerable rivet holes in vertical lines using weakness, and other defects still prevail, the result being a speidy breaking up of the vessel on takdng the fround, and at all times a tendency to breakage of sheer called broken-backed), requiring continual and costly re. pairs. The 1ngsge commonly used in doscribing the defects of iron vemels is, that they labour and strain, become leaky, and break in two when they are exposed to heavy weather or have the misfortune to bo atrande& Now, I do emphatical asert that these faults do not arise from the iron material, hut from thb false mode of oonstruction, rendering it not only exp ent but urgently neosary that the ystem of building wth vertical frmes should be totally altered, and I am surprised that the prinCiple of diagonal framing, which would obviate all objection to iron shipa, is not univerally adopted. We should then hear no more cf broken back, or of vemels breaking in two immediately o n taking the ground; for the great strength imparted by the latter mode of construction-which must be obvious to all who have any knowledge of sbipbnUding-ae tbe same time that iwould make the vessel generally more strong and lasting would altogother prevent the fornier defect, and, under time nnfortmuiate circumstance of Druning on shore, would mnot assuredly hold bar together as long, If not longer, thS timber-built ship. I have thse honour to be, Sir, - -- - ~~Your most obedient servai,t ANGLX,4Rc2T. J-ng1zon. bept. iu.
FRENH AIND INGLISH FMISsRMN.-On WednesdU L is (Yfford, master of the boat No. 299 of }eD and Nicholas Gerzne, master of No. 348 of Boulogne, which vessels had been brought into the Tyno on Tuesday morning by the English cruiser the Otter for an infraction of the fishing regulations by fishing within a mile and a-half of the coast, were brought before the North Shields magistrates, when the cbarge was proved by Lientenant Simpson and his chief omEcer. The llayor asked Lieutenant Sinpson if he had many complaints froTm the Englsh fishermen withb egard to damage done by Frencb boats fishing upon English ground? Lieutenant SImpson replied that complaints were inoesuaitly made to him of damage arising to English boats through the French vessels destroying their netr The nig ht before it was complalned to him that a bgo French Tuger had sailed through a fleet of English fising cobes with a gr nel over its stern, which tore up and utterly destroyed Sve or dx of the nets belonginD to the coblem. The Frenchmen, however, he said, oovered their numnbe and the English fishermen could not identify the logger, otherwise he would have brought her in. The Mayor said the magistrates of the borough were determined to see that the fisng treaty that existed betwreen this country and France was properly cIaried out. In this case the defendants would each be fined 101. and costs; but he deired them to tell the masters of other French vessels on the coast that if any more were caught breaking the law their vessels would in all probability be detained in port tbree months, The attention of the Admiralty has been calledby 2Thc Times on former occasions to the thoroughly unprotected condition of the English fishermen on the north-east covst, and, far from attempting to create any national antipathy between the countries, it is b'ut a matter of justice to direct the attention of the authorities again to the position of those sinfortunate men. We have before stated that tho French Government very properly see that the international treaty with regard to fishing is strictly carried out upon their ootstg, whereas our Government either neglect doing so, or do it in a very slovenly and careless manner. At the present moment there are from 150 to 200 large French luggers fishing for herrings in the North Sea between the Bomber ang Berwick, each manned with from 15 to 20 hands. To protect the English fishormen, and enforce the thing regalso ions, the English Government has provided is season bat one samer, tho Otter, to craise long thiB fl0 miles of coast and as the best fishing is within three miles of the land-the English fishing ground, and from the extent of coast she bas to protect, the chances are one hundred to one that the Otter will not catch a Fench boat in the infraction of the law. They, therefore, rim the cbanoe and break it vith impunity. In point of faot the Fronch boats have possession of the fishingt for as soon as they a ppear our boats make to the land otherwise their nets and gearing wrould, in sli probability, be destroyed. At least three screw steamers should be em. ployed by the Government to protect the coast doring the f g. Much bad feeling would be avoided if this were done, and all parties were made aware that the fishing re gulations would be strietly enforced.

CUABGrE OF MtMnM -A farmer named James Wright, residKng at North Scarle, in the county of Netingham, has been oommitted for trial on a charge of wilful murder, under the following circumstnes :-A. man named Willia;m Eollnd, of Girton, laer the above villag, pur chased of Wright some clover growing in a field belongins to the latter. A dispute afterwards aroae as to the t, me ol the barain, and the parte, took their cese before the IUn. colnahiremagistrates on Friday last, when a decision waa venega.inct Wright, and be had to pay the expenses of the ~earmg. At 5 o'clock on the following morning he was seen sitting under tha e of tho field where the clover wa with adouble.baur gn on his arm. When asked what he WAs dolng here loes he replied tht he had been waiting all night for aome eospan, bht they had not arri,ed. He added tbet he had lost hi cae at Lincoln on the previous day, but id the matter was not ended yet. In the oourse of the same day he told another person that if Holland came to his field for clover he would shoot hin. Bet'ween 7 ana 8 oclock in the eveninz Holland and one of bis sonswent into the field in queotion, and the former began to fork up some clover, when Wrigbt approchbed them witk gun mIhis hand and tto hoot them. The older Holland, however, continued to gatber the clover, and Wright, who was in an cxcited state, raised his gun and shot Holland in the left leg, the whole of the chage lodging in the knee which was frightfully lacerted. Holland supportod himsef on bis fork, and sid, " Oh, Lord I oh, Lord, Jim I I didn't think you would do this." Wright rzejoined, " rye done what Imeant to do. If I can't have you by the laws of the oountry Ill have you b- laws of my own., Holland then leat upon bis son's shouder and oontrived to get to the neareit inn, where he was put to bed, and three surgaons soon afterwards arrived. They speed that the only chauoe of saving the man's liFe wos to have the wounded leg amputated and the man himel and his relatives having oonsented the operation was iMlfully performed; but the poor fllow did not survive more than half an hour, having succumbed under the shock and the loes of blood.

Pecruiting for the varioun India reegments is proceeding atisfactorily, the numberof recruitsjoiaing thelndiandepOt at the Provisional Battalion, Chatiam, being at the rate of nearly 200 weekly, whic-h numbec it is confidently expected Wil be considerably increased in consequence of the reduction of the standard. In consquence of the large influx of recrsits into Chatham orders have been issued for the officers in command of the several depots at that garrison to send a periodical return to the Horse Guards, for the purpose of ahowing the number of men fit for embarcation at the ead of each month, takiag care that each man, before he is returned as fit to embark for India, has been instructed in the Enfield rifle exercise, with which weapon the 'whole of the Indian troops are to be arsued. Considerable activity pravails at the head-quarters of the Royal Engineers' establishment, Brompthn barracks, Chatham, in consequence of the War Department havirg decided oa sending out four companies of the Royal Sappers and M-iners, numbering about 600 offlcers and men, to India, for the purpose of carrying on the siege operations intended to be undertaken chiefly in the BengalPresidency.

Three companies of Royal Engineers about to proceed to India have joined head-quarters at Chatlham, and detachments of Royal Sappers and Miners have also arrived at Brompton harraoks for the purpose of completing the companies about to embark. The company of Royal Engineers from Dublin, and also that from Nova Scotia, will both join the Engineers' establishment at Chatham. Our correspondence from Malta reaches to the 30th of August, but merely mentions the arrival on the night of the 28th of August, from Liverpool and Gibraltar, of the steamer Lebanon, which vessel 'was to take her departure on the 31st for Corfu to embark troops for England. Major Vesey took passage by her to rejoin his regiment at Corfu.

DURHAM COvITyNT AGRicuLuRATL SHow.-The annual meeting of the Durham County Agricultural Society -was held at Stockton on Friday last. There was a most magnificent array of shorthorns, the very best animals which the country could produce, having been sent to compete for the Challenge Cup of 100 guineas value and the *other liberal prizes gven by the society. Thecup prze vas won by Mr. Richard Booth, of Warlaby, near Northallerton, with a splendid two-yearxold heifer, in calf, called Queen of Way. This heifer has previously carried off several Important prizes. In 1856 she was shown at the Royal Agricul-turax Societv's Exhibition at Chelmsford, and won the first prize; and in the same year she was equally successful at the Greas Yorkshire show held at Rotheram. In the present year she carried off the second prize at the Royal Agrioultural show at Sahsbury, the judges, after much deliberation, awarding the first prize to Colonel 'Townley's Rose of Athelstane. She subsequently obtained the first prize at the Great Yorkshire show held at York. In addition to carrying off the special prize, -Queen of May obtained the first prize in the class for twoyear-old heifers in calf. Colonel Townloy's Victoria was considered the next best animal on the show ground. In 1856). as a heifer, she obtained the first prize at Ubelmsford, and at Salisbury in the present year she gained the first prize for cows. At the Royal North Lancashire show she was exhibited at one, two, and three years old, and carried off the principal prize on each oceasion in the class In which she was shown. At Rotherham and at Craven last year she carried off the first prize in the two-year-old classes; and in the present year she gained the first prize for fat cows at the Great Yorkshire show. The prlze for the best bull of cny age was awarded to Mark Antony-a beautifal animal of a white colour, Delonging to Mr. Mark Barrowby, of Dishforth, near Thirsk. Last year he obtained the second prize for two-year-old bulls at the Royal Show at Chelmsford, and the first prize in the same class at the Durham County show held in the city of Durham. General Elaynau, belonging to Mr. John Watson, of Long. wathley, received the second prize. This animal has pre. viously won several prizes, and, among others, he won the second prize at the Paris show. Ivanhoe, Lord Scarborough, Alma, and Duke of Csmbridge, amongthe defeated animals, have all carried off prizes at various local shows. There was a very finecollection of young animnalsin theclassfor bulls under two years of age. Sir 1dmundl Lyons, bred by Mr. F. H. Fawkes, of Fzniey-hall, §orkshlre, carried off the first prize. This bull isconsideredone of the finect of his age, aud has carried off the first prize at every meetiRg at which he has been hown, inciudi Salisbory and York The second prize was awarded to M. Thomas Wetherell's Statesman. The :frst prize in the class for the hest cow -i milk or in calf was awarded to Colonel Tow,aley for Victoria, already mentioned, Mr. Booth's Bride Eleotobtaining the second prize. ,Qneen of May, in the clsss for -two-year-od heifers in calf, experienced a keen competition from R1se of Townley, belonging to Colonel Townley-a besutiful heifer which has Parmed off. the chief prizes at Craven, Salbur, York, and other 3aees.

The annual dirner aiterwards took Dlace in the Borough-hal and was presided over by Mir, ; J. Sperman, ot Newton btl, near Durha.
T1R SUFFERE&S BY TRB MUTINY -N INDIA. The followittg is a copy of a telegraphic desqatch from Colonel Phipps to the Lord Mayor, dated Babmoral, September 9 - "You may announce subsmriptions to the iFund for the Indiav Suferers of 1,0001. from the Queen, 3001. from the Prince Consort, and lU(I, from the Duchess of Kent." Lord Palmerston has subscribed 1001. The following statement has been drawn up by an officer who served many years in India and recently returned to this country - - ' *In reply to inquiries as to the necessity for a national subscription for the relief of sufferers by the mutiny in India, and with reference to an opinion in some al'arters that the Indian Government is bound to give compensation for all losses incurred through the revolt of the Bengal army, it need only be stated that, although the Government of India is bound to do much for the sufferers, and has already sent instructions to Lord Canning to relieve at once, to the best of his ability, all immediate cases of destitution without reference to class or position, and although some of the classes plundered have public and acknowledged claims on the Jest India Company, still it can be shown that the distress of the European and Christian community in India Is sudh that no amount of funds which even the present excited feeliug and sympathy of England may be expected to raise for their relief can be adequate, after the Government has done its duty to the utmost, to meet the full difficulty. "In all pubHo calamities-of famine or inundation, of general revolt and devastation, or other wide-spread affliction-it has been found impossible for the most powerful Governments to do more than to take early measures for the present alleviation of the sufferers their aid may be liberally granted in the first instauce to supply the immediate refief and means of subsistence, and eventually to compensate for all cases denandiog it; but, beyond this, It is to be remembered that the main resources and imperial -avenues of any State are principally and almost exclusively to be applied to costly pubho remedial measures, to the restoration of order, and to the grand object of meeting the calaiLty Itself. In a case like the present mutiny of a -whole army, and its consequences, any Government must soon find its existing means unequal to the cost, and that it has to entail an us,avoidable burden on the future resources of the whole empire. The East India Company should assuredly be liberal and just to those who have been the victims of the outbreak of its army, but it has to be just also to the country at large and to the entire interests of the milions it has permanently to protect. "It has therefore ever been assigned to national sympathy to inquire into and alleviate the more private details of misery. Hence the many general subscriptions in all countries which have been voluntarily put forward to aid their fellow subjects, carrying out what a State cannot hope to accomplish. " Admitting this principle, it remains only to establish that in India there is at this juncture Private suffering among our countrymen of such appalling magnitude as to call for the fuDest sympathy of our nation at large. "In this stage of the inquiry 'oe it remembered also that the readiest contributors to our European charities have, in many late instances, been the very community now struggling under one of the severest dispensations of Providence that history has ever had to record. "- The classes forming the sufferers by the mutiny have been already enumerated at the Mdansion-house meeting of the 25th of August. They are as follow:- "'1 L The individuals and families of the public services, and the military (officers anud men) and civil establishments of Government, -whose houses have been plundered by the rebel soldiery and the rabble of the several cities and large stations in the upper provinces. Many are now escaped with their lives to Calcutta and elsewhere, without even clothing or the means of present subsistence. " I 2. The hundreds of East Indian and other Christian families from the class of assistants, clerks, and cmp1oye!, in the different offices at the many stations and outposts which have been plundered by the mutineers, such failies being now refugees, withoat means, or home, or olothing. " ' 3. The many Earopean and Christian private traders and settlers also in the above stations, in fact absolutely ruined and deprived of their alL " ' 4. The families of the many scattered missionary and educational establishments throughout the same provinces. " ' 6. The many pensioners and their families, the artifiears and assistant overseers, and others employed on rail. ways and roads, and in Indigo factories, and other trading concerns throughout the same provinces; the schools, shop. keepers, newspaper and printing establishments, hotels, &c.' " Of the four last classes it is impossible to state the exact number of sufferers, but their extent is known to be great. Exclusive of wives and families, and of the many suferers in other places, there are stated to have been 1,500 Europeans and Christians lately residing in the principal stations ascertained to have been plundered from Benares to Rurnaul; with wives and families included, the numiber of sufferers may be estimated at more than 4,000. " Many of these families were lately living in comfort, with incomes varying from say 1007. to 500& perannum. The majority are now refugees at different places. In addition to these are hundreds and hundreds who have arrived in Calcutta in the return steamers, ordered to receive them from the crowded river stations atthe shortest warning, and who, we learn from theCalouttapapers and private letters, are teaching thatplaoe in utter destitution, so that a private subscription has been set on foot, which was headedby Lord Canning, with the princely private contribution of 10,000 rupees, Lady Canning iinng 2,000 rupees, and which, by last accounts, was increased to about 13,000 rupees by the Calcutta community; while communications from that vicinity have reached England entreating that more aid may be immediately sent out for these sufferers, and for the many stiUl expected to arrive. Many of the heads of families who have been spared are necessarily remining at the outposts and factories, and thus the wives and children are arriving wholly unprotected and without clothing. The manificent subscriptions of Lord Canning and others prove that the existing misery is great, and the prayers to us for assistance from home and elsewhere sufficiently establish the extent of the calamity, and of the inadequacy on the spot of means to meet It. "But it is necessary to advert to the position of the first and far more numerous of the foregoing named classes who are in Government employ. It is supposed that these should all look to the Government for relief. It is impossible. As regards the higher ranks and civil servants, many have friends and resources of their own to resort to, but the bulk of the middle and junior ranks of the army are unknown in Calcutta, the upper country being hitherto their main place of duty and residence. By the regulations of the service officers who lose their camp equipage and other military equipments can in due course claim compensation fromthe Government, but the total of thesums awardedin any oases of total loss are about 2,000 rupees for captains, and 1,600 rupees for subalterns. The regular pay of these ranks at aU times is equal only to their proper maintenance; but this, also, is now disturbod. In the majority of cases the bungalows and furniture and other necessaries have been utterly destroyed. The husbands, if stil on duty with the remaining army and its new lovies, require aU they can receive for their own subsistence to carry on the duties required of them. Their families are thus completely in want in thelr unhappy state of refuge and separation, and perhaps there was never yet a case of such urgent requirement of large national relief for our fellow countrymen as at this mnoment exists at Calcutta and elsewhere throughout India. " With the large proportion of the native army which have mutinied it may be asserted that at least 2,000 individualsaand families of the middle and junior ranks are, throughout the Bengal Presidency, at this moment in the predieament just described. Some are widows and orphans, to be provided for in due course by the military and orphan funds; but the yearly sums for captains' widows are but 1251. per annum, payable quarterly, and 901. for widows of subalterns, with about 401. yearly for orphans. A small addition from Lord Clive's and the Compassionate Funds completes the total eventual income of these unfortunate ladies. How, in the meantime, it may be asked, can these por plundered victims of the mutiny, though their lives have been mercifully spared, find means for present maintenance-for equipment for a voyage to England 7 It is alleged that the relief subscription is not intended for such as tnese-they must be referred to the Government. It is mere ignorance of the unhappy facts themselves that could have urged so unfeeling an opinion. "Let us instanee a few general facts applicable to all classes. The instances are not imaginary ones. " A subaltern and his wife, with one child, escaped by a miraele, it may be said, the massacre by the 6th R.egiment at Allahabad. The young wife had snatched up a few of her own and her baby's clothes; the husband, tb'ough sick, had attended to his duty to the last, and escaped penniless with the clothes en his back. 'They got on board a return steamer and reached Calcutta. They must proceed to England. He will receive passage money from Gov-ernment, but has to equip his wife and child for the voyage. Unless aided, they iust be dependent for olothing on the ship from their fellow-passengers, and arrive in England without a shilling, with about 1501. per annum in prospect (when due) to subsist on for three years of furlough. " A widow escaped from the massacre at a far station, and after much suffering reached Agra, where she wasnot known to a soul, without a rupee, and but hal attired, without a single change of clothes. She received immediate relief from the kindness of those at the place, itn she has to find her way to England. "The wife, with her children, of a poor missionary, who clung to his post when he had his house burnt and everything destroyed-books, furniture, school-all gone. She arrives in Calcutta, is kindly treated and clothed; but she, also, has to find her way to England. "- A young lady was marred to a deputy coUetobr (uncovenanted service); she fell sick, and was ordered to return to England. He was to remit home monthly surns for her suppozt. He was murdered by the mutineers int Oude. The remittances, of cour4e, have stopped, and she is without a farthing " The children of an officer in India are in Europe for education. The remittances for the past half-year have unhappily ceased. There are no tidings of the parents since the mutiny. The girls are charitably kept on at a lady's academy, but a lad is actuAlly turned adrift by his ' benevolent' tutor, and within the last week has attempted in London to ealist as a privabt soldier. " But why go on enumerating cases of this description s Pages and pages of themn might be recorded, maiy of them far more touching and even appalling, and all pro- bably more pressingly in want of relief.. floats and hosts of miitary and private famiies a ud refugees of all descriptions are at this moment scattered over India in utter want, and will the wealthy and others in oomfort in our own hapoy land be excused for not subscribing to a relief fund like the present because it is the opinion of a few who do not inquire into the circuinmmces that the East India Company is bound to make good all the losses acruing from the revolt of the Bengal army ? " Iu former cases of national subscription to meet a public calanity might not the wholp burden have been thrown on the Government with a ple$ of as much justice and feeling as iz the present %wful O*is, wbigh bs Pver- g_hQnmqd sour fellow.subjeCts and eountrymenintthe East? Are wto stand by unmoved a wiithhold all exerfion tio relieve, because many of the sufferers may perhaps eventually-ulairn some compensation from the 0vvernm4t1 As well might the spectators and bystanders at akiisastrous railivay collisdon look on and refuse all effort tei elease or 'uposise the strugglig victims before them, because in timne it might be proved that the railway directors and company. will have to dole out in a court of justie some pecuniary -compensation to the injured." MEETING AT BATH. A very influential meeting was herd at the Gualdhall In this city yesterday afternoon "for the purpose of considering what measures shaU be adopted for the relief of the suf. ferers by the mntiny n India." Tbe meeting was convened by the Deputy-mayoi, r. W. Bush (the Mayor beinig prevented by illness from attending to his official daties), who also presided, and wAa surrounded on the platform by a large nurmber of officers and other leading citizens. The DETuTy-Ayoit, having stated the objects of the meeting and dwelt upon the suffesrngs of our felloweoulitrymen in the East, called upon the inhabitants of Bath to show their sympathies by unmistakeable deeds. Major-General GODLEY then moved the following resolution- "That this meetinz, smpathiing with the many helsless safferer. r the late mntinIe lu India, who are now reduoed toa sAte of uttedeslitution, feels itresl called upon to reoord itx pubio sense of Ea. calamity, asd its detestation of the unheardf atrodtis of tns rebel arnmy, and of the rabole abettosof ite cruelty to helleMs womeu and chalren andourunarmed fllow-sbjecss inthe ast, ad trusetsthat the energette efforts of the Brititsh Government and of the E;at India Comnpany for tho represlsoef the rebellion and the puntihment of the guilty may, by the Divine blesing, be crow3ned0 with the earIest Buccess." After alluding to the all-engrossing nature of the muatiny now raging in India, the gallant General took a brief retrospeotof the history of that country during the ls 150 years. e condemned the pseudo-philanthropy of some of our Indian governors, and contended that it was our overweeningconfldeuce in the natives that had led to the present dreadful calamity. The barrier, however, was now brokoen down, and we must henceforth rule with a hand of iron. The horrible detsils published in the papers was nothing to the revolting reLations of private letters. We had he.rd of these things from hnsbands and wives corniog reeking, as it were, from the slaughter of their children; and 'their tales had been taken up by the continental press, which seemed astonished at the extraordinary selI-po";ession of the people who could record sueh calamities in the very facd of them. The type of all thesehorrors was that unhung miscreant Nena Sahib, who he hoped ere long would meet his deserts. Doubtless, if It was in our power we should rush to the rescue of our cointrymen and to the vindication of the honour of our countrywomen; but, is we coula not do that we were bound by all the obligations of religion and charity to afford what means were in our power to alleviate their sufferingg; and he exhorted the people of Bath to snake such an offering as should afford proof of the sincerity of their devotions when they prayed to the Almighty to save the effusion of blood and relieve the sufferings of humanity. (Applause.) The resolution was seconded by Mr. BourT, and was carried unanimously. The Rev. W. ISIAGrE moved,- " That, In consideration os the extreme urgency of the cose and the necesity for promptly mneeting the wants,f tDhe suferers. (now Iiteral depending on others in Calcutta and elsewhere for clothing and tlod, in addition to their cruel lors of husbands and Dauedt,}) cts meeting most anxiously eGnLets the benevolent cototbutions of ts fellowcitizens, and reoommends that subecriotlon ^lIts be opened at the eeveral banks and libraries in the city, and that the amounts, aa collected, be despatshed to the Central Committee in Mendon. There was a terrible eloquence in the facts, a fearful energy of horror in the tales of cruelty we were continuaUy hearing from India. The ears of the inhabitants of this land were tingling with the atrocities perpetrated upon our fellowcountrymen and countrywomen; their sufferings were burnt mto our memory. There was no need for him to dwell upon the subject. The word with which the resolution began expressed the feelings of that meeting and of the country. It was the good old Saxoa word so expressive of English feeling and determination. "Resolved."-We are resolved (said the rev. gentleman); England is xesolved. In the hour of her great danger and sudden calasity England stands before the world resolved, and her noble attitude has won the admiration of every civilized country. We have fearful dangers before us, and difficult duties to perform. We have to reconquer an em p ire, to crush oUt revolt, to do justice; God forbid that as a minister of the Gospel 1 should preach vengeance, but we have to do justice, needful justice, upon those wretches who have so barbarously butachered our countrymen andcountrywomen; we have to sustain the fortitude of our soldiers, to succour and help sorrowing widows and orphans, and to face many difficulties, but the utterance of England's heart is, " We are resolved i" not frantic or furious, not timid or dismayod, but calmly, sternly resolved to do our duty. (Cheers.) If England were for a moment fainthearted, let her take a .lesson from her children who have suffered abroad, and from whom come tales of fortitude and devotion that have won the admiration of the civilized world. Having graphically described the heroism of several of our officers during this Tevolt, the rev. gentleman said he could not believe that God had quite deserted us as a nation, and concluded with an earnest appeal to the people at home to pour out their treasures for the delicately nurtured women and children who were now suffering privations In India is lavishly as their htusbands anad brothers had poured out their blood for us. Sir A. ELTOIr, M.P., seconded the resolution. He was rejoiced that the city he had the honour to reprefent was among the first to come forward and stretch forth the hand of warm and earnest sympathy for the sufferers in India. Whatever guilt might lie at our door for the governmont of India, there v,as now but one duty before us-to nnite in ving to our rulers all the support in our power to put the mutiny, and punish the lying treachery and cruel brutality of those who had shown themselves to be inveterate foes of -our country. Mr. W. T. BLAiR supported the resolution, which was carried by acclamation. A very inflnential committee wras appointed to collect subscriptions and the Deputy-mayor announced that 4401. had already been subsc:ibed, and he believed everything augured well for a large subscription in Bath. Sir A. ELTON subsequently entered his name for 201, and several other gentlemen esubscrbed smaller amounts. COVENTRY. On Wednesday last a meeting was held at Coventry for the purpose of expresdng sympathy with and raisin subscriptions on behalf of the sufferers by the mutiny in lndia. The Mayor presided, and mest of the leading persons of the town were present on the occadon. The l3LtyoP, in introducing the business of the meeting, observed that he could not for a moment fail to believe that the accounts of the atrocities committed in India on the pers6ns of helpless women and children had roused the utmost indignation in the breasts of the people at Coventry. lIe thought that every town in England ought to expre3s sympathy with the unfortunate sufferers froma the revolt, and he fully believed that the moral effect of such a national declaration of feeling would be most excellent. The best way of showing that they really did feel for the victims of the outbreak would be to raise a subscription on their behalf. (Cheers.) Councillor DREsSER proposed the flist resolution, which was expressive of sympathy with the sufferers. He said that the rebellion which had broken out in India was not the act of a people who desired to fiee themselves from a tyrannical Government-it waspurely and simply a military revolt, and a revolt accompanied by unheard-of atrocities. Every one who had read of the horrors that had been oommitted must have felt his heart sink. He deeply sympathized with the sufferers, and should most heartily support the subscription it was proposed to open on their behalf. The Rev. H. DAvnts seconded the resolution, and in a speech of some length contended that the priestly as weU as the military element was largely mingled in the revolt, which he characterized as the declaration of Mahomedanism against Christianity. He did not believe that the fearful atrocities that had been committed on English women and children were the result of mere wanton love of outrage. Ideas in the Oriental mind were fixed and lasting, and it had long been the object of Asiatic warriors to obtain possession of and destroy the women and ohildren of their foes, by way of showing that those foes were powerless to protect their nearest and dearest relatives. For this reason the loss of a pitched battle would be less destructive to British influence than the recent massacres, for which he hoped a terrible retribution would be exacted. The second resolution, pledging the meeting to raise subscriptions on behalf of the sufferers by the revolt, was briefly introduced by Councillor MAxltRior. The Rev. 'W. DR.AKE, in seconding the resolution, said that some persons thought there would be very lhttle necessity for the subscriptions, as the East India Company would compensate the snuferers, but it should be recollected that the Cto}npany just now had their hands full. A committee was appointed to collect subscriptions, which are to he paid over to the metropolitan fund now being raised for the same purpose. The sum of 561. was subscribed in the room. . ,, . ,,DORCHESTER. A meeting of the inhabitants of Dorchestcr and the neighbourbood was held in the Guildhall of that town on Wednesday afternoon, the Mayor, Mr. Ensor, having convened the balte in consequence of a communication received from the Lord Mlayor of London, soliciting co-operation in raising funds to assist the destitu,te su8ferers by the mutiny in India. The Mayor presided, and among those,present there was a fair sprinkling of the clergy and principal inhabitants of the victnity. The proceedings wore prefaced with an earnest and appro. priate prayer by the Rev. R. Smith, after which his worship made a few introductory observations. The R1ev. H. MOVLE proposed the first resolution, which was as follows:- -That this meeting of the Inhabitants of Dorebester and the neighbott,oed dosires to express its sympatby with Itt tellow country men and native Chrt-tiaDS in India in the cruel sufferirgs they bare endured, together with thanfitluesm to God for the cain and noble manner in which they have borne those suffering% and the intrepid sirit In which they have been enabled to meet ten muttrewrs.' The Rev. H. B. WILLIS seconded this resolution, which was unanimously agreed to. The Rev. Prebendary FOOT proposed the next:-- "Th4t Inasmuch as those who ave rturvived theor unbeard-of ateocities a'e uow sfferting utter degtItution, and mnany are widows and orphans, this meeting auxiouply entreate its fellow-twow.men and the public at lasze to unite in aiding to reUeve those *ultk lngs by a lberal cootrlibmuto.'

LIVMPOOL4. The Mayor (Mr. F. Shand), In anxwer to a numerouslyi signed requisition, ha convened a public meeting, to be. held in the Sessions-house on Monday next, at noon, to afford the inhabitants of Liverpool and the neighbourhood an opportunity of expressng their sympathy with the unhapy mfferers In dia, and to talce such measures a may be deemed beet to aid In relieviig the urgent and pressing wants of many who are left totally destitute. NORWICH. Yesterday a meeting of tEe citizens of Norwich, convened by the mayor in conse4uene of &,very numeroualy.signed requisition, was held i i the GadhahdU "for the purpose of taking into eosgideration the hbet means of affording relief totl sufferaing lurope in India whose lives have not boen taken hk the .stve!.iutinee:s, but by whose conduct t they are rendered entrely destitate." tr. R.' Chamberlain.- the mayor, took the chair, and was supported by the birdBishop'of`Norwich, SirWilliam FPoster, Bart., Sir B. J. Harvey, Sr Samueul Biguold, Kr. J. . Gurney, M.P4 Professor .Sed'gwlck, the Archdeacon of s Norwich, and a Lsrge nun2ner of the leading inhabitants of the cty nd neighbourhood. It was the most numerous and mo*t influential meeting which ba been hel&in Nor!wich for many years. i The MAYOR, in opening the proceedings, read a letter from the Lord Mayor of London, inrviting co-operation in the work of assisting our suffering fellow countrynren and countrywomen in India. He remarked that the Lord Mayor had expressed a hope that the towns throughout England 'would follow the example of th cidty of London. That Nor. wich would be among the fist to render the assistance required, he (the mayor) had not the shadow of a doubt. (HFear, hear.) The Hon. and Right Rev. Dr. PmFLH , Bishop of Nor;Wich, rose to move the first resolution, which affirmed that the meeting, rerdingwith strong feelings of abborrence the mutiny among the native troops and the cruelties they had inflicted, expreesed its warmest sympathy with the sufferers in their distress, and while trusting to God for their deliverance, approved of the ansgRstion for raising funds for their immediate relief. His Lordship remarked that throughout the length and breadth of the land there was not a person who did not feel tho deepest interest in the eyents which wvere nw going on in India, and which had burst so unexpectedly upon this country What were the canses which had led to that calamitous outbreak it would be of course for the Government to conider, and also how far our policy with regard to India might have led to it. It wiasa grave subject, and would require the gravest deliberaions upon the pert of those who were in any way ! connected writh the government of India. (Hear, hoar.) iIt was not for him in his position as bishop to set I forth what that policy had been; all he wished to do was to direct the attention of the I meeting to the fearful atrocties which had been com- mitted, to the sufferings which had been inflicted upon Iarge nurmbers of our fellow ooumtrymen and countrywomen, and, if possible, to render them assistance. A great fire bad, as it were, broken out, and it wra their duty, not to attempt to put it out, for that was the duty of the authori. tiee, nor was it their business to search out the reasons which had led to the conflagration - their business that day was to assist in providing safety, shelter, and provision for those who had e en reduced to terrible distress in consequence of the calamity, and who were now almost without tie necessaries of life; that, he conceived to be the object of the meeting, and hewas very thankful to the Lord Mayor of London for commencing a movement which was likely to have most beneficial reaults. (Hear.) He was also thankful to the East India Company for the assistance they had rendered and were about to render to all whom their exertions could reach. He had heard from the Chairman ot the East India Company that the directors had sent out I f om the first full and clear directions to Calcutta that im- mediate assistance should be afforded to all who sought refuge there, whether they had any connexion with the Company or were independent of It. (Loud cheers.) That was acting in a liberal way, for which the Company could Dot be too highly praised. (Hear, hear.) The Compan bad also directed that the widows and orphans of fficers who had fallen by the murderous hands of the mntinous troops, or who had come to an unitimely death in any way in connexion with the mutiny, should be placId en the highest scale of pensions. (Hear, hear.) These u ere very grtifyiDg features of the case; but still it must be remembered that it was impossible for the Government to deal satisfactorily with the vast number of the cases of distress which had. been occasioned by the mutiny, and which nevertheless presented the strongest claims for assistance upon the sympathy of the Christian ubliq of this country. It was therefore another cheering feature in the case that the subject had been taken up with earnest alacrity by the citizens of Norwich, and the inhabitants of other towns and cities, as well as in the metropolis. But these exertions were not confined to England. For instance, in Calcutta itself, no sooner was the distress heard of-no sooner was there an arrival in that City of widows and persons whose property had been destroyedthan a subscription was entered into, and in a very short titae the handsome sum of 9,0001. was raised for their relief. It wis also very cheering to find among those subscriptions many of 1001. and smaller sUns, contributed by heathen families, who sympathized with the Christian inhabitants of the country, and wiho gladly came forward to relieve them in their distress. (Hear, hear.) Another interesting fact wasl this, that not only in Calcutta, where the distress had been prominently forced upon public attention, hut also in Bombay and hladra8, there had been displayed the same willingness to contribute as there had in those districts wvhich wvere nearerthe scene of horror. Lot them turn again to their own country, and look at that noble sacrifice which had been made by the Marquis of Dalhousie, the late GovernorGeneral of India, who, having spent the best days of his life in that country, and worn out in the pubHc service those energies whichpromisedto renderhimsousefulto the Governmnentathome,hadretired uponthe pension heso weUldeserved, and yet had placed the whole of it at the disposal of the .East India C ompany towards the relief of those great sufferingS wrhich prevailed in the country over which he lately ruled. (Cheers.) These, again, were encouraging facts; but not only in our own country and her dependencies was this willingness to afford assistance exhibited. For centuries England and France had been looked upon and had looked upon one another as hostile countries; but now a step had been taken by the Emperor-an addition to many acts of friendship he had performed-which showed that he considered there should be a recipro(ty of interest between the twocountries ; thatthere should be a co-operation and I armnony wThich would form a strong contrast to the ,tate of things in times gone by. (Hear, hear.) The Iemarkable man who was place- at the head of that jreat country had sent over at the earliest moment ihe munificent donation of 1,0001. towards the relief of our suffering fellow countrymen and countrywomen,-an act of ; indness wrhich he was sure the people of England would i ot soon forget. (Loud cheers.) ie (the bishop) believed that the moral influence of these tmited subscriptions would be very great, and that it would tend very greatly to trengthen the arms of the collected forces we were sending *unt in putting down the rebellion, showing, as it did, the sympathy not only of this country, but of foreigners with the sufferers, and their horror of the conduct of the mutineers. (Cheers.) He believed it would also tend very materially to strengthen the Government of Indla in the critical circumstances in which It was at present placed. (Hlear, hear.) His lordship concluded by saying that ho was pleased to thiuk that Norwich had taken a leading par6 in this movement, and that he bad thus been able to join in it. Mr. RoBERT SRUIA.N, sheriff of the city of Norwich, seconded the resolution and handed to the mayor a check for fbi. in aid of the subscription. The resolution was carried without a dissentient voice. Mr. J. H. GuRKEY, M.P., moved the next resolutiou which expressed an opinion that, though the East India Company would make a liberal provision out of their funds for the relief of the existing distress, there would be many aufferers unprovided forwho would have astrong claim upon the generosity of the Bnglish public at home, and that a committee to collect subscriptions should tberefore be formed. In supporting this resolution he said he had not the slightest doubr but that the people of England would act generously on this occasion, in order that those might be adequately relieved who were not in the service or in any way connected with the East India Company. The relief which would be afforded by the Government must necessarily be of a temporary character, but they must not lose sight of the fact that the losses of those who had sustained injuries at the hands of the autineers would be permanent. To the orphans who had lost their parents-to the widows who had lost their husbands the loss would of course be irretrievable. Though the people of this country could notrepair those great lossds, yet they might show their hearty and cordial svm. pathy with those who had sustained themn, and that oould be done most practically by such contributions as the resolution suggested. Hie trusted that they would be able to raise throughout the country such a sum as would give a real, valuable, and effectual token of practical and efficient sympathy to those wrho were labouring under a tremandous affliction. (Hea.r, hear.) Tbe hon. gentleman announced his intention of subscribing 200L. towards the fund,-an announcement which was received with loud cheers. Mr. 0. SPRIXcFiELD seconded the resolution, which was unapimously adopted. Dr. JOINSON, in moving the appointment of a committee, I eferred at some length to the atrocities vrhich had been I erpetrated by the mutineers, and teudered his tbanks to the publicpress for the faU information it gave upon the subject. He trusted that the most severe measures would e takent punish thse Se ople whom we had pampered to such an extent that they had forgotten their duty to us, to themseives, and to God. (Cheers.) Mr. R. HARvEY, banker, seconded the resolution, wvhich was agreed to, and an infLuential commiStee was forthwith named. The Bishop of Norwich subscribed 25. towards the fund, and nearly all the gentlemen who were on thi platform followed his example. On the motion of the Bishop of Noawica, seconded by Mr. GUst?raY, M.P., thanks were voted to the mayor for calling the meeting, and, the compliment having been acknowledged, the maeeting separated. NoRwicHr, Sept. 9.-(By Electric Telegraph.)A fatal accident occurred last evening to Admiral Hawtayne. The galant Admiral was walking on the south pier at Lowestoft with a little girl and a lady, her mother, and, the 4vening being very dark, befell over the side of the pier. The water wasg very sballow, but the Admiral sustained a ooacucelon of -he brain, and died in about half an hour.

The ATILITIA MA N at HOMB and ABROAD.* When we are ga-in about to embody our Militia and everything that relates to the defences of the country is regarded with unusuai interest, a imple statement of the career of a Militia regiment cannot fail to be of service as a oontribution to our stock of military information ; and of the 'volume before us, which contains the history of the Royal Blank5, we can say that it is written with considerable vivacity, so that whether the information is valuable or not it is at least always attractive. In one respect, perhap1s, the work may disappoint the reader in search of military details. The greater part of the volume is devoted to the foreign service of the Royal Blanksa regiment which was the second to. embark and the last but one to return, and which thus remained abroad for a longer period than any other Militia regiment. But its .oreign service was Simply the routine of garrison duties- routine which, by the time the regiment was fit for such service, became natural and commonplace to officera and men, the consequence of wshich is that " the mnilitiaman awbroad" is quite a different being from " the militianan at home ;" the incidents of regimental duty do not make so much impreseion upon him as the new sightm and sounds by which he is surrounded, andhe writes of the orange-groves and the religious processions of the lSediterranean islands rather thant of the Commissariat and occupations of the Royal Blanks. It is in the manufacture of the rustic into a genuine soldier that we are chiefly interested, and it is in the fSt 70 pages of the present work that we find this process described with great animation, and with a good-humour which shows that the toil of discipline was a labour of love, and that from first to last there was a most kindly sympathy between officers and men. On a cold day in January, 1854, the author conducts us to the streets of Dulminster, " swarming with a motley group of clodhoppers from tihe four corners of Blankshire-shepherd lads from the downs,-stout, ruddy chawbacons from the north, with the clay still hanging about their ironshod lace-ups, some of them having trudged their 30 miles with naught of victual to support the inner man but raw carrots,-here and there a collier lad from the western border, ragged and grimy,-or a pothouse help or adventurous stableboy in dilapidated corduroys, and bit of hat in napless decadence, but hanging knowingly on the cock to the last." On this first day there was an attempt at a muster; but it appears that the roll-call ended in a catcall, and the endeavour to divide the men into companies was attended with but a very partial success. They were dismsed to their billets; some to the Blue Boar, some to the Black Swan, some to the Flitch of Baon, and some to the Golden Lion. The officers who have thefr mesroom in a homely pariour of the Golden Lion, retire to their sanctuary to discuss tihe events of the day and to heaKr the opinion cf the Lieutenant-Colonel expressed as follows:-" A famous raw material in our hands and 28 days to cook itin. By MrS ! it shall be done. To-morrow, gentlemen, at 9, we meet in the drill-ground." What a task for those who had been taught to consider a period of sxmonths the mrinim um in which a recruit could be converted into a soldier i It was a task, however, which they had soon to commence n earnest, the drill-ground being an adjacent field of some 12 acres, hired for the occasion from a butcher. But the question was how to get the motley crowd from the marketplace and from the beershops to the field of Mars. What with a bugler who made a sound like the bray of a donkey, a drummer who vainly attempted to beat upon a mouldy drum, - dogs barking, women laughing, mnen talkng, it was no easy matter to convey the 750 recruits to the appointed spot. Once there, howiever- "Two hous sfficed to distribute them luto companies, and to hand them over to their respective captains. To each company was also allotted a pay-sergeant lately appointed from a regiment of the line. The men were hearty and full of zeal, and seconded with right good will the efforts of the officers to get things into order. To be 4ue, there was here and there a little grumbling. Dick wanted 'to bide wi' Harry,' and couldn't ' stomach being alongside o'Jack,' in regard to an animosity of long standing ainst the said Jack in reference to an affair of poaching, folTowed by peaching. "Then the light company were lndignant at being placed, as tbey imagined, at the rear of all, and commenced slipping off one by one to other companies on the sly. Howvever great had been the difficulty of colecting them on the ground, none whatever existed in clearing it. Ahintabout I billets and dinner was quite enoulgh, and in a marvellous short space of titne the field was deserted. " At this juncture we received a most welcome addition to ourmeans of action by the arrival of,a detachment of non-comamissioned officers and privates of Her hfajesty's 38th Regiment, and a smarter, cleaner, or more admirably! aupointed set of men never left a barck-yard, and most ably and considerately did they set about their laborious and tiresome occupation. At 2 o'clock we were an1 again in the field. The companies were broken into squwads, and the oldmillbegan to work again in earnest, the old clapper spinmng merrily to the same old tnne-' Eyes right ; eyes left; asyon was; why don't yOut stop when I cries halt,' and A Babel of the like orders and recommendations." All this time it must be observed that the regimentt is still unprovided with a luniform, and that the costumes of the recruits are more reluarkable for variety aud character than for elegance aud fitness. One is in a blue smock, another in an old ramekeeper's coat, a third is notable for his Jim Crow hat with Its yellow riband. The larger portion, however, consisted of "sfine grown strapping country lads, in the usual dress of a Blankshire peasant, with cheery, honest faces, and a manifest anxiety to do their best.' The best they can do in the meantime is in the disposing of rations, and they dispose of these with alacrity. It was at the end of three weeks of this kind of work that the General of the District told them that he never would have believed what he heard of their progress if he had not seen it with his own eyes. But no sooner was the regiment made worthy of such a compliment than it was dismissed, only to re-assemble, however, on the 4th of April following, having been recruited in the interval up to ita full coimplement of 1,166 men. The drill went on with renowed activity; the men were now provided with muskets, and in nine days went through the manual exercise " in a most creditable manner." Apart from duty, too, their conduct seems to have been generally good, and very much to be attributed to the watchfulness of the officers, as an instance of which it may be mentioned that to avoid the annual fair and cattle-market of Dulminster the regiment was marched to the top of a neighbouring hill, and on the downs in its rear spent a paerry day in races, leaping-matches, and other games, prizes being provided for the successful competitors. While the offlcers indulged the men with pleasures such as these they amused themselves by the old military resource of private theatricals ; and so, between discipline and relaxation,the time passed untilthe endof the month, when the regiment was once more complimented by the inspecting officer, the men were again stripped of their uniforms, clad in their own old habiliments, and dismissed to their homes with laughing faces to talk over what they were pleased to regard as " a spree." In six weeks more the Royal Blanks were again assemDled for permanent embodiment. Before the close of the day about 900 men had answered to the roll-call, most of the absentees having enlisted into the Line, into the Guards, and ilnto the Artillery. Then came the task of selecting from the 900 those wvho were best litted for foreign service, and sending back to their homes on leave of absence such as could best be spared-those, for example, who had large families dependent on them. Henceforth the regiment is to be tegarded as belonging to the regular army. It receives new colours from its colonel; it goes to church to receive some excellent advice from the vicar; it is marched off to Portsmouth and into barracks; it takes charge of Her Majesty's dockyard; it learns the art of converting ration beef into good soup; it fights valorously with a similar regiment stationed near it, which presumes to describe its men as chawbacons ! clods, and bumpkins; it is brigaded and reviewed much to the satisfaction of everybody, and especially of admiring cousins from the country, who come to witness the imposing sight, and furnish 3Ir.

SUBMARINE TELEGRAPH COMPANY. The adjourned half-yearly meeting of this oompany held yesterday at the London Tavern. The report stated that the submarine cableg of the joint companies have continued in perfect worldng order since the repairs of the accidents which occurred in the month of JaTnary last. The British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Companyh vecompleted the renewals andrepairs to the land lines. from London to Dover, and the whole of the wires, therefore, both submarine and subterranean, are now, and have beenm for sOme time past, in perfect working order from London to Calais, And from London to Ostend. The aecident to the company's cable referred to in the last report caused the lors of nearly a month's traffic, and itB subsequent diversion. for a more oonsiderable period to other routes; yet, notwithstanding this serious drawback, the revenue of thelast half-year has exceeded that of the halfeyear ending December, 1856, by 284Z. The directors have. been at considerable pdais to establish direct ervoes, and messages are now generally forwarded to most of the chief towns of Europe without re-transmission through auy intermediate office. These services, by increasng the. certainty andrapiditywithwhichmeessgescenbeforwarded, tend greatly to dovelope the telegraphic intercQUMse The business of the company for the month of July Ilt and up to the present time shows a oonsiderable Augmentation. over the corresponding months of the year 1856, and appearsto promise a gratifying result on the tranactions of the year. After mature considerAtion, the directors have determined that a moiety of the amount expended in repairing the cables should be charged against revemue, and that the remainig portion of the coets incurred should be taken out of the reserved fund accruing during the present year; there will therefore be only the additional sum of 1851. to be deducted from the amount that msy be set aside during the curent half-year. The amount of the present reserve fund will therefore remain intact, The total amount expended on the repairs was 1,5271. The amount of the reserve fund to be approriated for the half-year is 592L for both companies, and it is prod take 3751. from revenue, making a total of 9671, which deducted from the gross expense Incurred, leares 5660 to be carried over to the succeeding half-ya. After meeting the above deductions there stil remais sufficient margin to pay a. dividend of 7 per cent., and to carry over a balanoe of 2161. The revenue account for the half-year ending June 3(1 showed that 10,6881. had been received, and 4,2651. expeDded, leaving a balance of 6,4231 Resolutions were passed adopting the report and statemaent of Accounts; declaring A dividend at the rate o' 7' per cent, per aunum, less income-tax, upon the capital of the compan, pyable on the 24th inst.; re-electing Sir J.

EARLY CLos1Ga AssocxArAox.-La8t evening a general meetiDg of the members aDd friends of tbe Early Closing Association ws held at Exeter-hall, Mr. Alderman Wire in the chair. le espressed the interest he had taen. In the early closing movement from its commencement, which must be 1a4aen as the rause of his being called on to preside over that meeting. The movement was set on foot For the purpose of giving relief to a very large clas of perSons whe were liviDg in a state of slavery worse than Egyptian bondage, a state of things sanctioned and connived at by the prblic at large. The result of the efforts of that associstion had been that the hours of labour hbd nowbeen considerably abridged in nearly all brAnches of trade, and that advantage had even been extended to the profession of the law, to which he belonged, in which, owing to the exertions of the association, the Saturda half-bolyday had been almost universilly adopted. It. btiUl, however, remained that the benefit of the weekly half-holyday should be extended to ths otber classes of the community. The principal obetacle he saw at present to that being carried out was the custom of paying wages late on Saturday afternoons- but he thought that wages night be paid earlier on that ay, or the payment of them changed to another day, and were either of these coures.- adopted he saw no reason wby the Saturday halfholyday should not be enjoyed by every class of the community in the metropolis. With regard to the chief object of the association,-the earlier closin, in the evening,-he thought it lay chiefly with the publc to effect this object by abstaining from making purchases after a certain hour-say, 7 o'clock. It, however, rematned with those who were benefited bythe movement to show that they -were improving themselves by the advantage of leaving business an hour or so earlier, fQr this would be one of the greatest weapons they could use for the suocceg of the cause. He believed that many thousands had been largely benefited by the uiovement, and he heartily wished its success might be still further increased. Mr. LIlwall (the hon. secretary) proceeded to give a statement of the progress of the movement during the past year. With a view of impressing upon the public the sacrednebs of the cause, the co-operationof ministers of reliion had been obtained, and 80 sermons had been preached Inthe metropolis on the subject. An important and influential meeting had been held on behal of dressmakers' and miliners' assistents, with the view of restricting theinordinately loDg hours of labour exacted from them, nd had beon productive, i) was hoped, of most beneficial resultsa The success tf the effort for procuring theSaturday halE bolyday in the law was also referred to. A deputation had also waited on the Home Secretary to solicit the closing of doclards, arsenals, and offices under Government contl;ol ons baturday afternoon,, wvhich, however, had not been ittended by muchl success. Otherimportant meetings hadbeen held, and a number of pnbllcations had been issued da[ring the year. They were mucb indebted to the effor$ of minfsters of religion, and for the uniform kindnewss the press had shown tco wards it, for wFithout *the valuable assistance of those two important agenciesg the progress of the movement would not have been so great as they bad to congrtnLate themselves ml*on at the present time. Mr. whitmore moved the first resolution: -" That this meeting desires to express its deep interest in the objects souht. to be obtained by the 13arlv Closing Association-virz, a abridFment of the hours of labour in all. departments of industnal life, where necessary, especially on Saturday nights ; the adoption of a Saturday half -holyday wherepracticable;g the earlier payment of wages, and the rescuing of shop. keepers natd heir assistants from the drudgery of Sunday trding,-believlng that the furtherance of these objects is calculated ix a large measure to benefit not only the: numerous classes immedately concerned, but the nation *b. large." The R1ev F. a Blomfie]d seconded the resolution,. which was crried, as was also another pledging the meetin, to aid in carrying out tu objects of the association. Several other lergymen and gentlemen having addressed the meeting, a vot of thanks to the chairman closed the pro. ceedings.
