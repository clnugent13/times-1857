How often was the spirit of tCe tzoop3 romus and elevated by the bnDhiring strains of martial music, or depreesed for want of such a stimulus? The induence of musbo in education civilzatioD and oven In Dolitica is not su^ently apps.o Olated, f' Julien hs pased his life In studying ite eOfeat upon the people. Aft-rthecontinentalrevolutionsof 1848 he witnesed etery eventng, and for a considerable2iod, how great was the influene of thatmagnifioent and immotal hymn *'God BSve the Queen," in conrolidating and augmenting the affettloe and restect of the Englsh nationfortheirbeloved Loverelan.

But the present occasiont wil not admit of further dissrtation on the Influence of tho divine art over nations and their rlers. M. Jullien hopes and desires that some more able pen will take up a question of such public importance. Meanwhile, he confidentlytrunsthat alt those who feel an interest Inthesubject will, on hearing the GOuldee Band, agree with bim that some improvenientsmiaybe Introduced in thib country withregard tomilitary mus!c.

Hanover.iquare. 'Unhappily, this expectation was grIevously disaPpoeined, an,l Mr. Westerton, an churchwarden, called the atDee tico of the ex-Bishop of London to the objectionable praotices that tillU rvealed. I consequence, a determined eff'ort was made to eject him I=oilleeRatAster, 1853hut a strong body of the parishioners having ralled round him, carriedhis election, and formed a party for the fartherance of Protestant views. Aided by them,.and attire suggestion oI 3teiep l Bomiseld, he next instltuted a sault in the CouWsiterial Court.

Mr. Liddoll then appeled to the Judidel Committee of the Plrivy Council. Their judgment, althoug not entirely confirming those whIch had been delivered in the EcclesIlastical Courts, yet most emaphitically forbids the use of altars Instead of Commuil'on Tables as involving the doctrine of a sacrifice offered by a priest, and easmIatIng the Lord's Bao4sPer of the Churcht of England to the Mass of the Church of H sne hsthe dangerous errors of transubsatntiation. of the corporeal Frr3ence. and of the eamTidce of the mais are denounced as ilieetb the highest competent' authority In the realm, and the benetitwhc has thience resulted te net merely local, hut co'exteasive withalte places in which the United Church of Elngland and Ireland is b a established.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE VICTORIA CROSS FOR VALOM A new epoch in our military history was yesterday inaugurated in H[yde Park. The old and much abused campaign medal may now be looked upon as a reward, but it will cease to be sought after as a distinction, for a new order is inBtituted-an order for merit and valour, open, without regard to rank or title to all whose conduct in the field has rendered them prominent for courage even in the British army. A path is left open to the ambition of the humblest soldler-a road is open to honour -which thousands have toiled, and pined, and died in the endeavour to attain; and private soldiers may now look forward to wearing a real distinction whic kings might be proud to have earned the right to bear. The old spirit of exclusiveness, which, while emiting the order of the Bath to field-officers only, yet dissipated its honours on the whole Staff, may be conaidered to have terminated when policemen and parkkeepers, officers and privates, captains and foremast sailors stood side by side as they did yesterday in the presence of their Sovereign to receive at her hands that high reward for deeds which all had earned alike. Let us hope that with this last bright episode of the great Russian war the old rggime under which the heroism of the pivate soldier was ignored is at an end, and that the Victoria Cross will muster among its wearers a glorious bead roll of rank and file, who have always signialized their bravery, but until now in vain. If the campaign in the Crirmea has only effected this, it has done more towarcls maintaining the high efficiency of our army than any military distinction founded since the days of Marlborough. The display of yesterday in point of numbers was a great metropolitan gathering-it was a concourse such as only London could send forth. There were most vague ideas extant as to the time when the ceremony would commence, the prevailing notion > evidently being that Her Majesty would be on the ground soon after daybreak, or at least by 7 a.m., for even before that premature hour spectators began to assemble. Those who evinced this precocity in their time of attendance were, no doubt, under the impresaion that by so doing they would secure good places, though the result could scarcely have justified their expectations or repaid them for getting up aimost in the middle of the night. A very large apace, at least half-a-mile broad by three-quarters of a mile long, was enclosed on the northern side of the park for the evolution of the troops. On the side of this nearest to Grosvenor-gate galleries were erected for the accommodation of 7,000 persons, who by a pleasing fiction were denominated the public, though, of course, the distribution of the tickets which admitted to the enclosure was as exclusive as a presentation at Court. The station for the Queen was in the centre of the galleries, which formed a huge deal semicircle, enclosing at least one-third of the space in which the troops were formed. On either side of Her Majesty's position were smaller galleries for the members of the Legislature and Corps Diplomatique, who in virtue of their office were accommodated with seats, while the other portiou of the galleries gave only standing room. All the rest of the ground round the enclosed space was left open to the public, who had the usual general license to see as they best could, which, as it happened, was very little indeed. Every part of these unavailable positions thus liberally set apart for the multitude was thronged by people, in some parts 30 and 40 deep, who remained under a broiling sun with silent patience, enduring everything with only the faintest hope of seeing anything in return for all their sufferings. The public, in fact, seemed only invited to contribute a great crowd to the proceedings of the day. They formed a most important portion of the show, aud must rest content with having fulfilled that duty, for, aB far as the majority of them were concerned, the whole ceremonial might as weU have taken plaoe at Stonehenge. Whatever may be the advantages of Hyde Park as a place of exercise, and as a spacious arena in which the scions of the London population may be aired, it is not adapted to every purpose, and least of all for the use to which it was put yesterday. It would be difficult to name any public ground in London from which the always ill-used public could not have had a better view of the day's ceremonial. lVhat they did see we cannot undertake to say; but what ninetenths of those present assuredly did not see was the very pageant which they came to witness. In vain they pushed about, atood on their own toes and those of their immediate neighbours, cried out "' hats off," and remained bare-headed under a burning sun. The natural obstacles of Hyde Park were not to be overcome, and push as they might they could gain no viewv of what was pasiug at hand, but quite out of eight. Em !ere naturally exasperated at this, for though in the abstract the human head is doubtless a fine subject for contemplation, yet when some 10 or 12 intervene between you and the scene you are striving to behold the emotions excited by it are.neitherphilosophic nor pleasant. Thus, therefore, we were not surprised to hear among the disappointed mass that some occasionally swore in a more audible tone than is generally allowed to good society in public. Others bore their fate in silence at least, if not with equanimity, and their only desire appeared to be to get out of the crowd as fast as possible. On the old maxim that we derive some satisfaction from the misfortunes of our best friends it may console many to know to-day that even tho'e who composed the front ranks among the public were very little better off than the " sightless" multitude behind them. Between mounted soldiers and policemen their field of view was limnited in the extreme. Miany who had borne the heat of the day, supported hy the knowledge that they had secured an eligible position, found when the ceremonial commenced that it only commanded an uninterrupted view of X 45's back, or placed them vis d vis with the hind qiuarters of a volatile troop-horse. The former, it must be admitted, was a dull prospect, and not exactly one which men get up at dawn and struggle through half a day to witness, while the latter was decidedly unpleasant, for who could stand unmoved within reacb of salies from the heels of a powerful brute, from whose perpetual manifestations of gaiety there is no retreat ? Yet such yesterday was the lot of hundreds to whom in the early part of the day fortune seemed to have awarded the best positions, who only knew by cheers which made the horse more restiff and Constable X more rigid that something of unusual interest was taking place. A great portion of the troops were on the gr.und at 9 o'clock, standing in that picturesque disarray which is almost more effective as a spectacle than their close-formed serried ranks. The 79th Highlauders were there, as fine a corps as ever, but looking considerably shorn of their regimental beauty since the new uniform came in. There was a troop of Horse Artillery and two field batteries, wvith the 1st battalion of Grenadiers and Fusileers, and the 2d battalion of Coldstreams, forming great walls of men almost as fir-m and certainly as regular as masonry itself. There was a battalion of Marines, equal in appearance and discipline to the finest troops in the service, and the 2d battalion of Rifles, sombre and gloomy-looking as a thunder-cloud. The 11th iussars, 1st and 2d Regiments of Life Gaurds, and the Gtl Dragoons formed a glittering mass by themselves, from off which the sunsa rays seemed to dance and sparkle as from 10,000 mlirrors. In fact, a little army, complete even to sappers and miners, military train, and mule litters, and mustering neur 9,000 men of all arms, was yesterday assembled in Hyde Park. The persons who composed the fashionable portion of the visi'ors, if we may so term those who were admitted to the reserved seats, were very punctual in their attendance, and every part of the great expanse of platform was well covered soon after 9 o'clock. The heat throughout the entire proceedings was intense ; the ladies seemed tosuffer much from it, and even strong, hearty gentlemen were not too fastidious to extemporize rude fans from coat-tails, handkerchiefs, and morniDg journals, or any suitable material at hand. Not a breath of air seemed stirring, and the standard which marked the Queen's position drooped heavily down, as if it too snttered from the sun and was incapable of fluattering or active motion. Everybody simmered into a state of aggravation, and everybody gasped and said how hot it was, in a tone of private communication, as if the temperature was a State secret which must not be bruited abroad. Tn leas tropical nooks, beneath the trees, costermongers clro-e a brave trade in the retail of liquids from X ortly-looking barrrls which we fancy must have contained something better than water, as polica men formed the staple of their customers. Thinga went broiling and burning on thus tiUl about half-past 9, when the troops formed in contiguous columns, stretching right across the park in a bright line, the ends of which would have been scarcely distinguishable but for their incessant glitter. Alnost at the same time a small division of blue-jackets came upon the ground to represent the sister service. These were 100 picked men from the crews of the Excelent and Osborne, al of whom more or less distinguished themselves in the Baltic or in the naval brigade before Sebastopol. They were followed by a band of Chelsea Pensionersveterans of bygone wars-and these again by the boys of the Duke of York's School, headed by a duodecimo edition of a drum-major, who, in spite of an extinguishing "bearskin" which made half his little bulk, yet strutted and flourished his staff of offlice in a style that was inexpressibly amusing. A few minutes before 10 o'clock the officers and men who were to receive the high honour of the Victoria Cross marched in single file across the park to the Queen's position. Their appearance created a deep sensation, and well it might, for upon a more distinguished band of soldiers the public have never yet gazed. One was a policeman, and wore his plain uniform as a consable of the R division, No. 444. This was George Walters, late Sergeant of the 49th Regiment. who highly distinguished himself at Inkermann in rescuing General Adams when surrounded by Russians. Surely for such a man a better post may be found than that of a constable at 18s. a-week.. Another, in the dress of a parkkeeper, was formerly a corporal inthe 23d, who volunteered on September the 8th to go out, under a murderous fire, to the front, after the attack on the Redan, and carry in Lieutenant Dyneley, mortally wounded. Three or four were in private clothesgalant men who have quitted the ranks since the war and been rewarded more or less amply by civil appointments; 10 wereofflicersandmenofthe Guards, and 7 were of the Rifle Brigade. There were 61 in all, of whom 12 belonged to the Royal Navy, two to the Marines, four to the Cavalry, five to the Artillery, four to the Engineers, and the remainder to various regiments of Infantry. Of all 25 were commnisaioned officers, 15 were warrant and non-commissioned officers, and the others privates and common seamen. Only one was manmed-Lieutenant John Knox, who, after greatly distinguiishing himself in the Fusileer Guards, lost his arm in the attack on the Redan. As they stood in a row, waiting the arrival of Her Majesty, one could not help feeling an emotion of sorrow that they were so few, and that the majority of the men who would have done honour even to the Victoria Cross lie in their sbalow graves on the bleak cliffs of the Crimea. Wherewere the menwho climbedthe heightsof Alma, who hurried forward over the plain of Balaklava to almost certain death, who, wearied and outnumbered, yet held their ground on that dismal morning when the valey of Ihkermann seethed with flames and smoke like some vast hellish cauldroa ? Where are the troops who during that fearful winter toiled through the snow night after night, with just sufficient strength to drag their sick and wasted forms down to the trenches which became their graves? Let not these men be forgotten at such a time, nor while we pay aU honour to the few survivors of that gallant little army omit a tribute to the brave who have passed away for ever. But for that dread Crimean winter, and the way in which the troops were left to pass it, instead of 61 a thousand Victoria Crosses would yesterday have been deservedly awarded. Her Majesty was expected to arrive at 10, and precisely at five minutes before that hour the guns of the Artillery thundered out the Royal salute. The atmosphere was-close and heavy, and the scond of the guns struck with a heavy concussion that seemed to shake the air, and from what we heard of their effects would almost justify some of the chimneysweepers at the West End in demanding compensation. The sound had scarcely ceased when the loyal corftge, attended by the usual " brilliant staff," came upon the ground. Her Majesty rode between their loyal Eighnesses the Prince Consort and Prince Frederick William of Prussia. She wore her usual scarlet riding coat, with the General's sash over the left shoulder, and a General's plume of red and white feathers in her open riding hat. Round her left arm was the customary token of military mourning-a band of black crape. Prince Albert wore the uniform of a Field-Marshal, and the Prince of Prussia that of a Colonel in the Prussian service. riollowing Her Majesty were their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and Alfred, both in the Highland costume, and wearing the small Glengarry borinet and the eagle's feather. A long cortUge of gallant officers preceded H er Majesty, including, among others, General Sir Hew Ross, Major-General Wetherall, Major-General Sir Richard Airey, Sir C. Yorke, his Serene Highness Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, Lord Burghersh, Colonel Clifton, Colonel Maude, Colonel Sir T. Trowbridge, Colonel Gordon, the Queen's Aides-deCamp, the Duke of Buccleugh, Marquis of Allotbury, Marquis of Donegall, Colonel Patten, Lord Dynevor, and Colonel Holloway, Colonel Forster, Colonel Lake, Colonel Tyrwhitt, &c. After Her Majesty came the carriages containing the members of the Royal Family and General Lord Gough, Field-Marshal Combermere, General Sir Fenwick Williams, MajorGeneral the Hon. Charles Grey, Sir Colin Campbell, Lord Charles Fitzroy, Aide-de-Camp to the Prince of Prussia, Lord Paumure, Sir Charles Wood, Sir Richard Mayne, &c. As the Royal party approached the troops the signal passed from rank to rank, and almost with a simultaneous movement, and with a dull, heavy attle, the whole force presented arms and lowered olours, the bands at the same time playing the National Anthem. The effect of this salute was grand and impressive beyond description. All the Royal party, attended as before, rode slowly down the front ranks of the whole of the long line. The Du e of Cambridge rode on the left of Prince Allert during this inspection, and returned with Her Majesty to where the crosses were to be awarded. It was evident, from the arrangements made in the space in front of the galleries-the handsome dais exected and table fixed-that it was expected Her Mlajesty would dismount and distribute the crosses at the table. The Queen, however, did not dismount, but with her charger a little in advance of the suite, with the Prince of Prussia on her right hand, and the Prince Consort on her left, awarded the crosses from her seat on horseback. The form observed was simple in the extreme. The order was handed to Her Majesty, and the name and corps to which each recipient belonged mentioned as lie presented himnself. The officers and men passed before the Queen in single file, advancing close while Fhe affixed to the breast of each in turn the plain bronze cross, with a red riband for the army and a blue one for the navy. So quietly and expeditiously was this done in every case that the whole ceremony scarcely occupied 10 minutes, and must have been over before the general but very distant public in the background were aware it had comuLenced. The names and ranks of those decorated are as follows, and each advanced towards and was decorated by Her Majesty in the order in which they are placed ROYAL NA VY (IN-CLUDING TilE NAVAL BRIGADE EMPLOYED ON SHORE.)

Imnmediately after the decoration was concluded tne officers and men on whose breasts the small dark crosw, the sign of so much honourable distiietion, was just visible, drew up inline opposite the Queen's position, but at a sufficient interval to allow the troops to march past between. Thewhole forcetheninarched past at slowandquick time, and, after all, the Horse Artilery and Cavalry came through at a canter. These movements, simple as they were, wvere among the most effective of the day. All the bands of the Cavalry were brigaded facing theQueen, butin rearof theVictoriaCross men. The troop of Horse Artillery was the first that passed, and they were followed by the 1st and 2d Regiments of Life Guards, the 6th Dragoons, ]1th Hussars, the Sailors, Sappers and Miners, the three battalions of Guards,theMarines, 79th Highlanders, the 2d battalion of Rifles, two field batteries, the military train (late Land Transport Corps), and last of all the mule litters. The entire manceuvre, both by Cavalry anud Infantry, was splendidly performed; but, on the whole,the Marines showed best, not even excepting the Guards. As the regiments arrived at the north end of the Park each company wheeled to the left and took up their respective positions for marching past again. The briliant appearance which this double stream of troops presented, the solid masses o men, -with their undulating movement, show ing itself in the rise and fall of thousands o bayonets, exceeded any metropolitan display of the kind we have yet witnessed. The marching past at quick time had more life in it. This evolution, both by Horse and Foot Artillery, was beautifully performed. The batteries of guns and waggons seemed each a whole machine, so perfect was their regularity of movement. The march of the cavalry was also good. Amongthe infantry, the Marines again distinguished themselves, though, of course, the Guards carried off the honours. The marching of some of their companies seemed a perfectly marvellous perfection of drill. All officers as they pussed saluted the Royal party and the colours were lowvered. The sailors saluted in their own way by marching past bareheaded, but with all their eyes intently fixed upon Her Majesty. It seemed almost a pity that more of the blue-jackets were not present, if only to gratify the people, for beyond a doubt they were the favourites yesterday, and, on leaving the ground, got one of the few hearty cheers, which broke the otherwise rather silent proceedings of the day. The 2d battalion of Rifles were as usu;l at-, tended by their ram, which had been washed And apparently bleached forthe occasion. Itis now'too fat to march at quick time, and its hobbling attempts to overtake the regiment yesterday, as it passed the Queen, excited much amusement. When the whole force had passed the second time tbe Infantry formed in the order inwhich they stood when Her Majesty arrived, while the Cavalry, headed by the Horse Artillery and ArtiUery, came past at a canter. This much enlivened the proceedings, and it was really a grand sight to see the Life Guards coming down the Park like a stream of bright metal, and pouring theirsolid troops past with a dash and velocity that seemed invincible. The Horse A rtillery, of course, tbundered by, though the men seemed doing their utmos' to hold in their fiery horses. After this the cavalry and artillery returned to their original positions in the line, which marched forward and again gave the impressive Royal salute, and thus terminated the proceedings of a day from which we trust a new era may be dated in the history of our army. The greatest anxiety was manifested on the part of the people to see the Cross of Valour men as they dispersed and left the ground; and the course of almost each could be traced by the little group that followed him, anxious t, get a glimpee of the Cross, with which all found more or less fault at the very first. Than the Cross of Valour nothing can be more plain and homely, not to say coarse-looking. It is a very small Maltese cross, formed from the gun metal o ordnance captured at Sebastopol. In the centre i a small crown and lion, with which latter's natural proportion of mane and tail the cutting of the cross much interferes. Below these is a smal scroll (which shortens three of the arms of the cross and is utterly out of keeping with the upper portions) bearing the words " For Valour." Mr. Hancock was at first ordered to strike a hundred crosses with steel dies, but the intense hardness of the metal destroyed the dies, and it was at last found necessary to cast them and chase them afterwards. Bat even with all the care and skill which distinguishes Mr. Hancock, the whole cross is, after all, poor looking and mean in the extreme. The merit of the design, we believe, is due to the same illustrious individual who once invented a hat. One of the rules of the order is that it shall never be conferred but on account of acts of personal bravery performed before the enemy, or, to use the words of the rule, " Nothing but the merit of conspicuous bravery shall be held to establish a sufficient claim to the honour." Another rule of the order we are sure our readers will peruse with satisfaction. It is "From the date of the act by which the decoration has been gained al noncommissionedofficers and privates shall be entitled to a pension of 101. a-year, and for each additional bar 51. a-year extra." May they long live to enjoy itl (From the Court Circular.) Her Majesty quitted Buckingham Palace, with the Royal cortege, at a quarter before 10 o'clock yesterday morming, in order to distribute the Victoria Cross in Hyde Park.

PBESEXTATION OF WAP. MEDALS AT ZZVER- POOL. Yesterday afternoon the pensioners belonging to the Liverpool district were drawn up in a square, two deep, in I he Exohange area in that town, to witness the presentation of the French Crimean medal of valour to two Bitish soldiers, Sergeant Brummell, of tho 46th Regiment, and Private Joseph Mitchell, of the 68th Light Infantry, the tormer of whIom lost a leg while under fire in the front parallel, and the latter an arm in the trenches. The medals Were for general bravery during the campaign. The presentations were made in the name of the Emperor of the French by Colonel Bell, inspecting field-officer of the dis. t,iCt~ besides whom there were present Lieuntnant-Colonel Rogers, Captain Fanlkner, Cap tain Bradish, Captain Middieton, &c. The ceremony was witnessed by the Mayor of Liverpool (Mr. F. Shand) and a party of friends from the balcony overlooking the area, and byalage number of merchants and others. Colonel BEL, in presenting the medals, said,-NoX, my old soldiers and companions, I am going to introduce to your notioo two of my old and gallant comrades in the lte war -two gallant baen who duritg the whole of the Crimean srvice were ditingisbEhed by their own commanding offBcers Andby the General Commanding-in-Chief, and who ar now to be decorated with the war medal by the order of His Imperial Majesty the Eniperor of the French-the greatest bonour that can be conferred upon a British soldier after re ceiving distinguished marks of honomr from his own Queen. I have very few words for this occasion; it requires but few. These medals (producing tlem); have been forwarded from the Emperor of the French to be conferred upon two brave Bzitish soldiers. They bear upon one side the bust of HIis Imperial Majesty, and upon the other the words " Valcur and " Disciplinas" are iscribed. Those words are always applicable to good British o01diers, for a well disciplined British soldier must be a valiant n}an, and a valiant man is always a well disciplined soldior, deriving all his honour from discipline and obedience to orders. The British soldier asks no questions on the day of battle. el attends to the orders of his commanding officer. He looks neither to the right nor to the left; he fights to the front; he fights for victory, and wins. (Cheers.) Here are two gaUant men, Sergeant Brammell (who stepped forward) and Joseph Mitchell (who also stood to the front). These men nobly distinguished themselves in the late war. No one knows what that war was, nor can any man teU its hardships aud dangers, not even The Timnes correspondent. The hardships of the British army are known only to those strong men who were there to share the dangers, and who outlived the perils, But tbey are rewarded by their country. Look round upoa this assemblage of the gentlemen of Liverpool ; the merchants of this great city have come to see two gallant soldiersdecorated with this sign of valour. Look baok a little in the order of events and recall to mind the noble ladies of England, who not only wept for their countrymen but worked day and night, and sent them all the comforts and conveniencies and delicacies they could to the plateau of Sebastopol, with the hope of sustaining and encouraging the bravo hearts wbo were dying on that cold sod. Soldiers, you can never do enough for the ladies, God bless them I (Cheers) In conclusion, Colonel Bell having affixed the medals on the breasts of the recipients. heartily shook them by the hand, and wished them long hfe and health to wear them, assuring them that wherever they went they would be the passcorts to a cordial reception. (Cheers) Ai the request of Mitchell, one of the newly decorated heroes, three times three cbeers vere given for the Queen, three for the Emperor of the French, and three for the ladies of England. The proceedings then terminated. Both Brummell and Mitchell have already received the English Crimean medal, Mitchell with three bars' Alma" "Inkermann,"and " Sebastopol," and Brammell with one bar-" ScbastopoL"

DOUGLAS .TERROLD. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The pubEcation of a hint in your columns might b' the means of providingthecomforts of life for the remainder of her days to the relict of Douglas Jerrold. Hlence I trouble you with this note. The captains of the pen, including your own great " Special Correspondent," are exerting themselves on the stage and in the lecture-room to honour the memory of their friend. Bat the stage itself has not come forward in the same cause to a like extent. Yet the stage owes more to Jerrold than does thelibrary. His dramas have kept many a " house' open, filled many a "' treasury," and fed many an actor, Their author dies, and his widow is unprovided for. What should the stage do? I would suggest that every theatrical manager throughout the country should give a benefit, and every actor contribute his services to aid her whose husband wrote "BlackEye'd Susan." If it could be carried out, I would have the benefit take place at every theatre, broad England through, oa the same night; and, on the "Jerrold night" let none but Jerrold's dramas be pla7ed. Let each manager charitably cast aside all remembrane of what he bas paid to the Dramatio anthors Society, and address imself toa work of charity with good feeling and witb energJy. Tlhe result would unfailngly be anannuity for Yy own services, if practicable, I wonld most cordially give. I an. Sir. vour moAt nhet c - - - -- - - JOHN HENRY ANDRSON. lamnuuQ in"eatre, dunie 2§.

Lennard, Bart., who died on Thur-day morning at his town mesidence in Bryanstone-square, having, within a few months, reached the extreme age of 90 years. He was the oldest living barone: of the united kingdom. The deceased, who was created a Faronet after the Union in 1801, was sou and testamentary heir of the 17th Lord Dacre, whose surname and arms he assumed by sign manual. The late baronet was twice married-ramt, in 1787, to a daughter of the late Sir John St. Anbyn; and secondly, in 1833, to a daughter of the late Sir Walter Stirling, widow of MIr. Henry Dawkins Miiigan. 2he late Sir Thomas was a deputy-aeutenant of the county of Essex. He is succeeded in the baronetcy by his grandson Thomas. Be was born in 1826, and married in 1853 to Miss Vood, daughter of the Rev. Sir John Page Wood, Bart.

I FOREIGK INTELLIGENCE FA2NOE. (FOM OUL OWN cOOUE.NDxN.) [The foUowing apperd iA our sond edition of yes. terdav :-1 PARI, TaURrSAY, JUNZ 25, 6 P.a The official numbering of the votes for Paris took place at the Hotel de Ville this morning; the numbers do not show any very material variation from those already published. Indeed, there is hardly anything more to be said on the subject. There is no further uncertainty about the provinces; the returns that come in show that the Government has it all its own way, or nearly s-I,and the mortification caused at first by the succem of the two or three Opposition candidates has given place, if we are to take the words of oficial people for it, to great satisfaction. Six electoral " colleges" will have to be again convoked in 15 days-three in Paris, one in Mayenne, one in the Somme,,- and one in the Maine-et-Loire, where the "absolute majority" has not been obtined, but in three of these the contest wil be between Conservative candidates. 1ML Garnier-Pag2s transfers the votes he has received to his Democratic opponent, ML Ollivier, in the fourth district of Paris; and AL Bastide withdraws in favour of X. Darimon. The united votes of the former are stiU 143 lower than those given for the Government candidate, and nothing will be left undone to make up the difference, witti what success remains to be seen. In the seventh district the united votes are still 136 under the official candidate; and General Cavaignac, in the third district, hopes to keep the advantage he has acquired. Itisimpossible to say how these will turn out. In the meantime it haabeen intimated to the Ministerial press to be very moderate in its langage -when noticing the second elections, and to avoid everything likely to excite an angry feeling. The following are the official rs6ults of the remaining elections, the only place stiU to be decided being Corsica, in which place the electoral proceedings wrill take place on Sunday . Departments.

Among them is one from the pen of a gentleman who has for some time past occupied one of the veryhighest posts under Govermment-that of President of the Council of State, and who is one of tbe great props of the Imperial regime. M. Baroche, the person I allude to, addressed in that eventful1 year to the electors of the Charente Tnf6rieure a " profession of faith" which exhales the very spirit of Republicanism. The followiug mre the most remarkable extracts:- " I am a Republican from reason, from sentiment, from conviction. It is not as a pis-eacr, or as a temporary measure, that I acopt the Republic, but as the only form of government vvhich can henoeforth secure the grandear and prosperity of France. After the sad experience we have had for the last 50 years, after the successive overthrows of three Govermments, different in origin, but all based on the monarchical principle, I am convincedthat Royalty has comr. pleted the term of its existence in Trance, and that it has no further root, no further basis, in the country. It is to the Republic that all good citizens ought to raUy without reserve, without mental reservation, and they must consider as criminal any attempt to restore mosarchy. The Republic only can give to the industrious classes of the towns and country the well-being and the political liberty to which every citizen has a right, by securing to aligratuitous eduiation and a fir remauneration for labour, by protecting agriculture, by suppressing the hateful impost on articles of consumption, and by establishing at the expense of the State places of asylum for infancy and old age. In a word, the Republic alone, by the sincere application of the principle of national sovereignty, can found in France the reiga of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Such are my reasons for desiring the Republic. Buxt I desire also (to use the fine expression of Lamartine) a Republic which shaU make itself loved and respected, a Republic which vill not make itself an object of fear to any one, except to the enemies of the State, the enemies of our institutions. Our newa Constitution must, therefore, be strong, energetic, but prudent and moderate, and founded on the respect of family and property. "As s 8incere and diinuerestcd patriot I shall be happy to co-operate so far as I can towards this great work of national regeneration, if the sufr6ages of my fellow-citizens c,l1 me to the Constituent Assembly. " J. BAROCHE, "Batonuier of the Advocates at the Court of Appeal of Paris, and forminr Deputy for the Charente Infdrieure" I wonder if the Emperor ever cast his eye over the profession of faith of his President of the Council of State, in which the three monarchical riegimes, including, of course, the first Empire, are thua denounced? It would be curious to know at what period M. Baroche, the "sincere and disinterested patriot," began to feel the change creeping over his mind; and one is tempted to ask what sort of profession of faith he would address to the electors, supposing the present rdgime upset to-morrow. WVith such specimens of human weakness, not to use a stronger and more fitting term, before them, it is not surprising that the electors gf the 3d, 4th, and 7th arrondissements regard as they do the men who share the confidence of the Emperor, and are the props of his rggime. The French Academy has just elected :r. de Yontalembert its director for the ensuing year. The Academicians bave shown better taste and a superior appreciation of talent than the electors of the Doubs. M. de Ealloux has also been elected Chancellor of the Academy. The Emperor left Paris at 10 o'clock this morning for Chalons-sur-lfarne, whence he is to proceed to Plombi&res by the new section of the Strasburg Railway, opened for this occasion between Nancy and Epinal. A battalion of Voltigeurs of the Imperial Guard, with their regimental band and their colonel at their head, together with a battalion of the 8oth Tnfantry, were stationed at 9 o'clock at the terminus of tho Strasburg Railway, and formed a double line within the rails. The Emperor and Empress arrived at the terminus precisely at 10 o'clock in an open carriage. A second carriage accompanied them. The Emperor took leave of the Empress in the saloon of the special train, which started at a quarter past 10. MIM. Jayr-Roux and the Baron d'Hervey accompany t,le Emperor to his destination. The Empress returned immediately to St. Cloud. A telegraphic despatch has been since received, which announces that the Emperor arrived at Chalons-sur-Marne at 25 minutes past 1. His Majestv will leave Chalons at 7 to-morrow morning for Plombieres direct, passiDgthrough Nancy and Epinal. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received;_ " ST.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE HOUSE OF LORDS, FRIDAY, JUNE 26. Their lordsbips met at a-quarter to 4 o6clock, ROYAL COMNIISSION. The Royal assent was then given by commission to the following Bills:--The Princess Royal's &nnuity Bill, the Cinque Ports Act Amendment Bill, the Transportation and Penal Servitude Bill, the Great Southern and Western 1Bailway Capital Bill, the Chepstow Gas Bill, the Reversionary Interest Society Bill, the Inverness and Nairn Railway Bill, the Guildford Water Bill, the South Shields Gas Bill, tho Sunderland 'Zas Bill, the South Devon Railway Bill, Meritons and Hagen's Sufferance Wharfs BiU, the Bedale and Le burn Railway Bill, the Chester Water Bill, the GuDdford (ias Bill, the Great Western and Brentford Railway Bill, the Peebles Railway Bill, the Willenhall (Wolverhampton) Gas Bill, the St. Helen's Canal and RaUl way Bill, the Tralee andKillarney Railway Bill, and Gius. tiniani's Oath Bil. The Royal Commissioners were the Lord Chancellor, the Duke of Argyll, and the Earl of Harrowby. Their lordships shortly after 4 adjourned until 5 o'clock, when the LORD CHiANCELLOR resumed his seat on the woolsack. Lord DUNGANNON presented a petition from 3fona. ghan against the Ministers' Money BilL The Earl of ALBEMAIRLE gave notice that he should on Friday next lay upon the table of the House a petition fro n the King and Royal Family of Oude, complaining of the treatment which they had received at the hands of the East India Comnpany, and praying thlat a select committee might be appointed to take their grievances into consideration. OXFORD UNIVERtSITY. The Earl of DERBY said he should seize the opportunity afforded by the motion for the second reading of the Oxford University Bill, on Mionday next, to make some observations with respect to certain proposals affecting Oriel Colleee, which were contined in the papers which had beEn laid upon the table of the House the day before by his noble friend the Lord Privy Seal. OATHS BILL. This BiU was brought up from the House of Commons. and read a first time. The Earl of DONOUGHMORE presented various peti. tions from Ireland against the abolition of ministers' money. TEHE DISTRIBUTION OF THE VICTORIA CROSSES. The Earl of DONOUGHMORE said that he had perceived a notice in the public prints that accommodaYon would be provided for those persons who applied for tickets at the Quartermaster-General's Department; he had sent a letter to that depattment, to which, however, no answer had been returned, and he certainly thought that some accommodation might have been afforded for members of their lordships' House. Lord PANHURE said that no doubt there had been a general understanding that tickets could be procured upon application. Some alowance ought to be made, however, for the shortnems of the time for preparation, and in point of fact the applications had been so numerous, exceeding, he believed, 20,000, that it had been impossible to open anl the letters which had been received. The Marquis of CLANRIC0ARDE had personally no reason to complain, but he certainly thoughtthat upin such occasions places should be reserved for the members of the two Houses of Parliament in their coUective capacity. Lord VIVIAN considered also that accommodation should have been provided for both Houses of Parliament. He himself had been fortunate enough to obtain a place, and certainly the arrangements on the ground had been all that could be desired. THE CONDUCT OF CBRTAIN MAGISTRATES IN K1ILKE;NNY. Viscount DUNGANNON, in rising to call the attention of their lordships to the conduct of certain magistrates in the city of Kilkenny, said that he was aware of the invidious nature of the task which he had undertaken, and nothing but a strong sense of duty had led him to undertake it, because, although it was never a pleasing thing to become the accuser of any class of persons, it was especially disagreeable when those persons were public functionaries. Tbe facts of the case to which he wished to call their lord. ships attention were shortly these:-In the month of January, 18560, several Scripture roaders were assaulted and much injured in Kilkenny, by a mob of persons who waylaid t em. The case was brought before the justices of the town, the Mayor, Mr. Potter, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Cullen, and Mr. Smithwick, who were Roman Catholics; Mr. Green, the st-pendiary magistrate, his brother, and Lord J. Butler, who wvere Protestants. Mr. E. Smithwick took a very decided part against the Scripture readers, and endeavoured-an attempt, to he sore, in which he signally failed--to prove that the Scripture readers had pasted placards offensive to the Roman Catholic religion upon the Roman Catholic chapeL He then asked Mr. Curtis, the director of police, if he had sent out Roman Catholic policemen to take part in a matter in which Scrip. ture readers were concerned; that gentleman replied that he had sent out three men whose turn it was for duty without considering what theirreligion might be, and thereupon Mr. Smithwick stated that it was a most improper proceeding, and that a Roman Catholic constable would have been justified in refusing to obey the order. Now, would their lordships consider that such an observation was decent or proper coming from a person on the magisterial bench? On a subsequent day a Roman Catholic attorney was permitted to say to one of the witnesses without any of the mragistrates, with the exception of Lord James Butler, interfering, "Go down, Sir; I should be sorry to be near yon if I had any money in my pocket." Mr. Green aud his brother snd Lord J. Butler considered the assaults fully proved, but the majority was against them, and Mr. Smith. wick had certainly then qualified his previous statement by alleging that he had not meant to say that a Roman Catholic policeman would have been justified in refusing to obey his orders; but that it was wrong to send out a Roman Catholic ceonstable to protect the enemies of his faith who were doing what was insulting to his religion. Now, he would not enter into the question of the expediency of employing Scripture readers, hut still their vocation was a lawfal one, atd they were entitled to the protection of the law. It was curious to observe, also, what was the condition of life of some of those persons who were intrusted with the commission of the peace, Two of them kept small shops for the sale of whisky, and a third kept a small grocer's shop where whisky was also sold. Mr. nmithwick was a brew6r. He did not mean to say that th Roman Catholics must necessarily be wrong and the Protestants right, but he could not but look with more confidence to such men as Lord James Butler and the Messrs. Green than to persons of such station as those to whom he had been referring. He should have to present Mr. Smithwick to their lordships in a still more invidious light. In January of this year a man named Ryan, who was in Mr. Smithwick's employ, was charged with severely beating with a whip two Protestant boys, who had, at his own request, given him some tracts. On that occasion Mr. Smithwick not only gave the defendant a character, but also took Ihis seat upon the bench and assisted to adjudicate upon the case, which was dismissed entirely in the face of the evidence. Had an English magistrate acted in that manner he would not only have been cautioned and reprimanded, but struck out of the commission of the peace. Some time afterwards the boys to whom he had previously referred were assaulted by a number of persons and complained to the magistrates. Mr. Smitliwick was on the bench, the only Protestant mAgistrate being MIr. Green. Although the police gave evidence in support of the charge, aUl the persons were dismissed except one; and he, although he admitted that he bad struck and tripped up one of these boys, was only fined 6d. What must he the opinion of the public as to the ad. ministration of justice when the decision of any case involving a dispute between Catholics and Protestants depended as to whetber on the day on which it was brought before the Courtbt the Protestant or the Catholie 3magistrates were in a majority? His only object in making this motion was to obtain an open field and fair play for that p arty in Ireland with which he was connected, and which at present was not treated 'with justice; and, above all, to secure a fair administration of justice in Ireland. The noble earl concl'ded by 3moving for a select committee to inquire into and report upon the subJect. Earl GRANVILLE said that his noble friend at the head of the Government of Ireland was as anxious to secure a fair administration of justice in Ireland as any one could be, and no departure from that principle had taken place in the cases brought forward by the noble lord. With regard to the first fase, the Lord-Lieutenant, on getting the Kilkenny paper frarded to him, lost no time in calling the attention of .ir. Smithwick to the words imputed to him. That gentleman in reply stated that the report inx the paper was ieoorrect, and that he had taken the first opportunity, immediately after the appearance of the newspaper, of publicly impeaching the report, but his remarks on that occasion also w.re incorrectly reported, much being omitted and much misrepresented. This explanation was accepted by the LordLieutenant as satisfactory, but he wrote at the same time to ay that had it not been so he should have taken other steps. With regard to the second part of the noble lord's remarks, the asaults referred to were of the most trivial eharacter tbp,y wer seeoc by-- -thmaitte,ndo man thywere disposed of by the magistrates, and no complaint whatever was made to the Government by the parties aggrieved, but at a subsequent period by a body of gentle. men caUing themselves the Protestant Association, which he understood was repudiated by the great majority of the Protestants of Ireland as representing them. Under these circumstances the Government did not tbink it was necessary that any inquiry should take place. Hecould not help thinking that it was worthy of the consideration of thoqe excellent men, who were anxious for the propagation of their own religion, whether the manner in which some of their subordinates acted was likely to carry out their objects. It appeared that some of these persons were in the habit of holding forth in the public streets, in loud offensive tones, flourishing their sticks and forcing their tracts upon the -unwilling paesers by, against the peculiar tenets of the Church of Rome, interlarding their disoourse with denunciations of Her Majesty's Government. This was certainly not the most efficacious mode of propagating pure religio. It was a matter of great difficulty to afford protection to such persons, while at the same time that protection only encouraged them to persevere in tbeir offensive denunciations of the religion of their auditory. In a case of this sort it would be impossible for the Government to interfere, and It would be still more improper f. r their lordships' House to go into any investigation of it. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of DERBY was disposed to think that the cases brought before the House by bis noble friend, in wbhio' the grossest partialsty was alleged to have taken place on the part of magistrates, were such as to call for the most close and searchiDg investigation by the Government. He did not tbink that questions of this Itind, affectinog the conduct of magistrates, ought lightly to be interfered with by that House, but certainly they ought to receive the serious considerationi of the Government. His noble friend opposite stated that Mr. Smithwick was calec onx to ox. plain the language which he ilad weed, and that be wrote 4 letter to say that his language was very different from that which had been reported. ElIe thought, however, that it would have been more satisfactory if Mr. Smithwick had put in writing the exact words which ho did use, and left others to judge of their effect. (Hlear, hear ) The more practical course, he thought, would have been to refer the case to the Court of Queen's Beach, and he said this tho more, because one of the greatevils in eth administration of justice in Ireland was the tesndeucy that existed to look to the Government. (Hear, hearj This was a great misfortune in so far as it interfsre',>wi%h that feeling of self-dependence which oughtto prevail,andhe therefore should like as a rule to see the Govcrnicnt appealed to only in the case of misconduct on the part of officials appointed by them. He presumed his noble friend did not intend to press his motion for a committee to a division. He could not regard that as the most suitable mode of appealing against the decision of a bench of magistrates; but, ab the same time, he thought his noble friend was jasbified in bringing the case before them as one that demanded a Eearching investigation on the part of the Government. (Hear, hear.) The Marquis of WESATME&TH know of several painful instances of disputes of this nature that had occurred within the last few years. The Scripture readers were frequently insulted and spit upon in the discharge of their duties, and he denied that they were the offending parties in the disturbances that took place. Lord DIUNGANNON, in reply, said he should not press his motion, although he did not think the noble earl opposte had fully met all the statements which he had made. The motion was then withdrawn. ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN INDIA. The Earl of ALBEMARLrE rose to present three petitions from persons of various denominations resident in the province of Bengal. The prayers of those petitions were in some degree different, but they all concurred in condemning those changes in the criminallaw of India which were understood to be in contemplation, and which were recommended by the Indian Law Commissioners. Those changes would affect nearly every principle to which the people of this country attached importance. They would affect the implied conditions UDon which British subjects had been induced to invest their capital in India, and would, if carried out, have the effect of driving most of the wealthy capitalists from the country. The petitioners were active, intelligent men, by whose exertions the resources and wealth of India bad been developed, who sent annuaUy 13,000,0001. worth of produce to this country. besides 7,000,0001. in one article-opium-to China. Upon that article they paid taxes which realized 3,500,0001. a-year, and without which the Indian Government would be re. duced to a state of complete bankruptcy. The petitioners complained of two sets of measures; one was actually under the consideration of the Legislative Council of India-the creation of a new procedure. To that the petitioners offered no objection, believing that any procedure must be an improvement upon the discreditable state of anarchy in which the courts of that country had been for nearly a century. They did, however, object that a new class of magistrates was to be created, and that British residents would be deprived of the protection of the laws of their country if the fanctions of the Supreme Court were to be handed over to the magistrates and police of the provincial courts. The petitioners objected to the amalgamation of the Supreme Court and the Sudder courts which would reduce British residents to the miserable condition in which the natives were now placed; they objected to being de,prived of the writ of Habeas Corpus and of trial by jury, as recommended by the commissioners. The petitioners claimed, as heretofore, an exemption from the criminal jurisdiction of the country courts, until those courts should be presided over by competent and professionally qualified judges. After the comments which hadalready been made upon the report of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, it was unnecessary to quote much evidence; but, In order to show the unanimity which prevailed upon this subject, hc (Lord Albemarle) would just read an extract from one of the petitions:-" The criminal courts of the East India Company have been the dread and terror of the people. They are used as instruments of outrage and persecution. Convictions in them are regarded as evidence as much of misfortune as of guilt." These courtsgave immunity to thegang robber, andwere terrible only to the innocent. The gang robber knew, to borrow the words of the Lieutenant-Governor, that "the administration of criminal justice in India is considered a mere lottery, in which the prizes are in favour of the guilty." That fact was also known to his unhappy victim. Although proverbially disposed to litigation and little inclined to show mercy to those who had injured them, the Bengalesc could hardly ever be persuaded to proseeute for robbery, " from the full conviction," to borrow again the words of the Lieutenant-Governor, "that the guilty men wil be acquitted in the teeth of the clearest evidence." Mr. Halliday stated that very few of the heinous offenders were brought to justice at alL Of every 4,000 persons charged with heavy crimes one-half eventually escaped. That was not owing to the want of evidence, for evidence was too easily procurable, but because the magistrates and Judges were perfect'ly conversant with the manner in which the evidence was obtained, knowing the torture that was inflicted upon theprisonerand the witness, He wouldgiveone example of the mode in which evidence was got up as stated by Mr Kenny, a planter, at a great public meeting held to petition against the "Black Act,' as the measure with which the Britih subjects were threatened was universally called in India. Mr. Kenny related that in the village ia which he resided the body of a boy was found hanging to a tree. The circumstance was reported to the superintendent of pollce, and by him was brought under the notice of the magistrate. The latter took it into his head that the boy had beon murdered, and told the superintendent that he was to bring the murderer before him within seven or eight days or to resign his office. The superintendent returned to the village and charged the master of the boy with the murder, The man denied it. He was put to the torture, but persisted in declaring his innocence. The superintendent then seized upon an old woman iathe neighbourhood. She was tied down; fire was anplied to her nostrils and ot -er tortures were resorted to whilch he could not describe to their lordshipsunless they orderedthe reporters to withdraw. The superintendent gained his object; the woman criminated the man, and both were brought before the magistrate. The woman then stated that all she had said was said under the influence of torture, and the magistrate dismissed the case, with a slight reprimand to the superintendent, teling him to be more cautious for the future. Plenty of similar cases might be brought before their lordships; and it was with such administrators of the law that the British inhabitants of India were now threatened. Having now described the evil, e would proceed respectfuly to suggest the remedy. He would suggest that the law should be administered by professional lawyers, and that there should be courts iu proportion to the population and the area, including Benares, Patna and other great commercial towns. He should also like to see unpaid maglstrates, native and European, wherever procurable; and he believed that if the courts were presided over by professional judges there would be no difficulty in finding an unpaid magistracy. He wished it to be distinctly understood that these courts should be open, entirely independent, and placed on the same footing as the suprenie courts of our own country. He had high authority for stating that the lex loci should be the law of England. This was no new experiment. The law of England had been tried in four different countries. Persons of every religion and of almost every nationality had come under its influence, and it had given universal satisfaction from the security it offered to liberty and property, and the readiness with which it might be adapted to native laws and customs. But, it might be asked, how did he propose to pay the expenses of these works? The answer was a simple and obvious one-vyi, that the same remuneration which was given to the incapable and incompetent boy-judges who now administered injustice should be continued to the professional lawyemrs We now sent a young man of 20 out to India-a paid covenanted servant-for judicial employment. Till he reached the age of 30 he could nct properly be laced upon the bench. After 12 years more te was entitled to a retiring pension, so that while we paid him for 22 years' serviceahe did only 12years' work. The professional lawyer, on the other band, educated himself; and he had reason to believe, from inquiries which he had made, that there were many gentlemen belonging to the English, Scotch, and Irish bars who would be perfectly ready to go out? provided they received the same salaries and retiring pensimns that were now enjoyed by the servants of the East India Company. With these remarks, in the full conviction that the importance of the subject was recognized by Her hlajesty's Ministers, be would lay the Fetitions on the table, unaccompanied by any motion, hoping that the hands of the Legislative Council would be stayed until the question had been brought before their lordships by one more competent to deal with it than The Mfarquis of CLANRICARDE regretted to be obliged to infer from the silence of the Government that no progress was really being made iai the decision of what he would venture to call the most important branch of the great Indian question. The state of India now was such that British capital, enterprise, and skill could alone he expected to develope its resources, restore its finance, and make it a valuable possession of, instead of a burden upon, this country. The advice given the other day by the chairman of the Court of Directors to the merchants and manufacturers of Manchester-that they ought themselves to extract a supply octonfrom the soil of India-was very BOUIIC AUCL judielous; but tne great impediment to the establishment in India of indigo planters and cotton speculators was the maladministration of justice. British people would not ventu-e their persons or embark their property where there were not good laws. He differed from the peti tioners upon one important point. They prayed that no alteration should be made in the Supreme Courts. He thought the Supreme Courts ought to be amalgamated with the Sudder Courts. The Supresme Courts gave universal satisfaction to Europeans and natives, and they were as good as the Company's courts were bad. He wanted to know why, after the amalgamation had been announced by Sir Charles Wood, it had not taken place? It was s sid that it was better to refer the matter to the Legislative Council in India. From that opinion he dissented. and he reminded the noble earl tEarl of Ellenborough) who on a former occasion had expressed his concurrence in it that in 1833 he entertained a differentview. Upon the gronrd of retaini g theindependent character of the Supreme Cou ts, wvhichhad greatly contributed toraise them in pnblicestimation he thought that Parliament was the place where such legi-iatsve acts ought to be done. Iedoubted, indeed, whether legally the Governor-General and Legislative Council had power to touch the Supreme Court. A clause in the Act of ]R.33 provided that the Governor-General should not have the power of making any laws or regulations which should in any degree affect any prerogative *f the Crown or the autbority of Parliament, and another clause provided that the Governor-General should not abolish any of the courts of jnstice established by Royal charter. These courts were tstablished by charter, and therefore the Governor-General and Legislative Council had no power to abolish them. But if it were contrary to statute law to refer the power og amalgamation to the Governor-General and Legislative Council in India he submitted that the only proper course was to legislate here. The judges of the Ucmpany's corts, it should be remembered, were civil awvants, who had zeceived no previous legal training. The present system was one, therefore, wiih, ias big opW,ni xequired Alteration, He saw no remm 4gy expsl should be sent out to discharge the duties of a magistrate in India simply because he had been caUed to the bar in this' country; and there were, he thought, varions modes by which a person's practical knowledge of the administratioa. of tho law might be tested before he received any such appointment. The noble duke the Poatmaster-General had upon a former occasion stated that lawyers in this country got no regular professional education. That might be the cas, bt such men were never made judges; and he might add that the magistratesinIndiadisposedof cases of life anddeath without pOssessing the same competence to the discharge of their important functions which existed in the case of those who performed similar duties in this country, and without being exposed to the exercise of the same degree of watchfuluess upon the part of the public. We sent out our civil servants to be collectors of Excise, and if it was found that they were not sharp enough for that position they were made suagistrates, and even judges after the lapse of a certain time. The system was, in fact, one of the most objectionable character, and ho was only surprised that it could have lasted for so long a period. There were in our Revenue and Customs Departments in England men who discharged their duties in a manner the most admirable, but who, he should like to know, had ever thought for a moment of allowing them to preside at the Old Bailey or in the Court of Common Pleas? It was no wonde' that petitions were submitted to their lordAhips praying for some modification of a state of things which operated as a great grievance in India, and he trusted the petitioners would receive at thelr hands that redress to which they were entitled. The noble lord concluded by asking whether it was within the competency of the Legislative Council at Calcutta to repeal, alter, or nullify an act of the Imperial Parliament, and to assume the powers of a perfectly independent legislature, by rejecting Bills laid before them in pursuance of announcements made to Parliament by the Ministers of the Crown. The Duke of ARGYLL said it had been contended that an amalgamation ought to be effected between the Sudder and Supreme Courts in India, bat in reference to that point he ight observe that in a pamphlet which emanated from a gentaeman who represented the interests of the Europeans residing in Bengal it was stated that the Qaeen's judges, the Company's judges, as well as the members of the Council, togethr writh the writer himself, whorepresentedhimself as a lawyer and a law reformer, regarded the plan as a whole as crnde and impracticable. If the Government in India were not comptent to hit upon a plan for the formation of a now court, then it would befor the Imperial Legislature to take proceedings in the matter; but there was, he thought, no good reason why Her Majesty's Ministers should not suspend their judgment until they had received the report of the Indian Government. His noblefriend asked whether it was within the comcjetency of the LegislativeCouncil at Calcutta to alter or nullify any Act of the Imperial Parliament. He (the Duke of Argyll) apprehended that it was not, but he might add that, although they could not take that courso, ye they were in a position, not to abolish the Supreme Court, but to make aay such modification in its jurisdction or any amalgamation of it with the Sudder Court Which might ssem to them to be expedient. It had been enacted that it should not be lawful for the GovernorGeneral in Council without the previous sanction of the Court of Directors to create any new cour vwith power of life or death over the subjects of Her Majesty. Itwas clear, therefore, that the Legislature had contemplated conferring upon the Indian Legislature power to establish a new court which might deal with questions of life and death, and since the period to which he had referred a new Act had been passed greatly improving the constitution and character of the Indian Legislative Council, and, as no power granted by the former Act was repealed, it was plain tnat the intention of the Legislature had beenthat the Indian Legislature should have ample power of dealing with the subject. He would not enter into the diflicult question as to how far It might be prudent to bring the sub. jects of the Queen within the jurisdiction of the native courts. He believed that it was most expedient in those courts that great reforms should take place, and it might be doubted whether bringing the subjects of the Queen withiu their jurisdiction might not tend, from the additional publiecity which would be given to their prooeedinAg, to ameliorate the administration of justice in them. The great difficulty in the administration of justice in those courts arose not so much from the character of the judges as from the character of the suitors with whom thev had to deal. It was admitted in all the petitions which had beeh presented against these courts that the great evil which existed arose from the facility with which false evidence might be adduced in them, andit didnotappear byanymeanscertin that that facility might not be removed by the introduction of subjects of the Queen as suitors. The question, however, was one of considerable difficulty, and one with regard to which a great difference of opinion prevailed among persons best informed upon the subject. Hewould not express on the present occasion any opinion upon the subject; but he must say that hethought that itwould havebeenvery imprudent for the home Government to have legislated without referring the subject to the consideration of the Indian Legislature, and he had seen letters fronu Lord Canting, in which that nobleman expressed a distinct opinion that it would have been disrespectful to the new Legislature of lndia if the home Government had proceeded to legislate without consulting them. The Earl of ELLLBNBOEOIJGH.-I do not attempt to say that I have made myself master of the contents of the 500 pages of foolscap which contdin the new code prepared by English lawyers for adoption by the Government oc India, and I must confess that I have not the smallest intention of undertaking that labour (a laugh); but I cannot imagite that any gentleman who prepared that code could ever have suggested the abolition of the Supreme Courts in India. I cannot imagine that he can have done so, because the Legislative Council has not the slightest power of doing so. It has the power of altering the form of jurisdiction in those courts conferred upon it by special provisions, but it has not the slightest power of abolishing them, and I cannot believe that the legal gentleman who prepared this new code can have thought that it was not intended by the acts which have been passed upon the subject to maintain as courts of original jurisdiction in the capitals of the different presidencies the Supreme Courts. The most important que - tions which come before those courts are questions affecting the interests of the East India Company and of gentlemen in their service, and, strange to say, whether it be from the badness of the advocates they omploy or from some other cause, the Government are almost invariably beaten. (A laugh.) What the result might be if four or five gentlemen in the service of the Eaet Iudia Company were associated with the judges of that court I cannot pretend to say. With regard to the general question. I believe the case to be that there is no power of compelling the Legislative Council of India to pass any law whatever. Parliament has reserved to itself the right of directing the officers of the East India Company under penalt of being guilty of a misdemneanour to do what they are oIered to do; yetl don't think, looking to the whole of the Acts of Parliament, that there is any power of compelling the servants of the Company to do anything in a legislative capacity. By the new constitution of theb egislative Assembly it contains members who are not servants of the Company. There are two judges, and there is the leganl member who is appointed by the Crown, and it is especially enacted that no measure shall be passed in the absence of those gentlemen, so that a mere abstinence of attendance upon the part of those gentlemen would be sufficient to impede legislation. As regards the question of the noble marquis, I can only say what does the Government of India know of any Minister of the Crown ? It knows nothing of the President of tho Board of Control. It knows nothing of Queen, Lords, or Commons, unless they speak through au Act of Parliament. In fact, it knows nothing but the orders of the Coxit of Directors. No doubt, the Court of Directors act under a Minister of the Crown; but no one knows what he puts in his letters or what he strikes out. Many things, no doubt, which have been viewed with considerable favour have emanated from him; hut, on the other hand, with him may also have originated many things which have brought great unpopularity upon the Government, and which have arisen from the economical views of a Government; and we may therefore fairly lay down the rale that the Minister of the Crown is entirely inknown in India. I will not say anay thing more except a few words with regard to one topic wbich has been adverted to by the noble duke. I fancied that the closing observations of the noble duke indicated a disposition to concur with the proposal for placing Eler Majesty's English subjects under the jurisdiction of the native courts, and I earnestly recommend bim, and I recommend the Government, and I recommendParliament, to use the most extreme caution before adopting any measure upon the subject. There are a small number of persons in the mid5t of an immense population, and we cannot submit to any change which may in the slghtest degree impair the ascendancy and supremacy of England. I do not give utterauce to my own views alone, for I have heard similar views expressed in stronger language by the late Duke of Wellington, and I would further press upon the consideration of the noble dnke the question whether he believes that justice would be obtained in those courts. I do not. A native Juue, nonau potaly isn fomnothing, and vvould return to nothing, would dare to decide against an Englishman going to his court with all the authority of his nation and of his energy of character; but, at aU events,I trust that no step wi be taken without the most careful consideration. (Hear, hear.) Lord CAI!PBELL said that the present state of the administration of justice in India, both as regarded Europeans and natives. was most unsatisfactory. Europeans in the most remote provinces were amenable to no courts but those at the chief towns of the presidencies, and while this was a great hardship to any of them who were prosecuted, it was a still greater hardship to those who had to prosecute them. In point of fact, if an European committed an offence at a distance from the seat of government there was no practical remedy whatsoever. It was now proposed that they should be subjectel to the local courts. That was a most desirable measure if the local courts could be made competent to administer justice. (Hear.) The problem which had to be Iolved was the reformation of the local courts. Years, however, passed away, and nothing was done (hear, hear), and he was afraid that if this delay continued the safety of our Indian empire might be compromised. Therefore, supporting the prayer of petitions which he had himself presented, he most earnestly implored Her Majesty's Governmnent to take effectual measures for removiag the grounds of these complaints. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH said that he saw no ob- ection to the establishment of circuits of European judges. On the contrary, he thought that much good would resalt from the adoption of such a measure, hut be thought that practically there would be much diffiiculty in obtainling substantial justice if residenlt planters had to go before their neighbours. The subject then dropped. MI'NrSTERS' MONEY (IRELAND) BIL. Earl GRANVILLE moved the third reading of this Bill Lord CLANCARTY rose to move that the BiU be read a third time that day six months. He felt that he lAbouredundergreatdisadvantage in making that motion after the declaration of the noble earl, the leader of the great Conservative party, from whoms be never differed without the greatest regret, that bie Q wnt mean to uffer any further opeosition to this measure; bett there wer-± limits beyond wIch deference could not be carried, and after giving the most serious consideration to the subject he felt that he conld not, in justice totheargaments of the noble earl and to his own position as one of the hereditary advisers of the Crown, abstain from offering his *nost determined opposition to this Bill, even at its last stage. The noble earl was in error when he said that he would cast upon tho Government the responsibility of this muasre. After a measure was sabmitted to their lordships, and was adopted by them, the responsibility became theirs as well as the Government's. Neitber did ke think that the noble earl was justified in using the expression " Lib6rav, anirAm 1 mean," It depended masly upon him whether or not the House should be freed from recommending this measure to the Crown, and he oecupied too high a position to be held to have merely an individual responsibility. As to this Bill being a measure of conciliation, inasmuch as it removed a grievaRce under which the RIoman Catho'ic populatiohi were labouring, he should be glad to know what evidenoe there was of such a grievance. 108 Petitions had been presented against the Bill, but not a singe petition in favour of it. The only petitioners were Ier Majesty's Government, who petitioned to be relieved from- the duty of enforcing the law. No doubt the passing of this measure would secure to the Government the support of what was called the "independent Irish Opposition," the private aim of which was the overthrow of the established church. It would be very satisfactory if the Government would gite some assurancethat aggressions upon the rights of the church were to stop here, for at p resent no one could teUl where they were to stop. The noble earl concluded by moving that the Bill be read a third time that day sit monts. The Earl of DERBY said that it would probably oe satisfactory to his noble friend to know that the course which he had marked out for himself on a former evening-thai of not offering any further opposition to the passing of the Bill-had met with the entire and cordial approval, expressed i writing, of the Most Rev. Primate of all Ireland. As to any influence which he had exercised on peer4 sitting on that side of the House to follow the same coursa as himself, he could only say that he had not addressed a single word to any noble lord on the subject, except tkose which he had addressed publicly to their lordships on a former evening. From the present etate of the ilouse, and particularly of the Opposition benches, the noble lord would be able o judge what proportion of their lordships were of his (Lord Derby's) opinion, and what of his own with reference to the further opposition to this Bill. He should be very sorry, however, to have it thought that in abstaining from any farther opposition to this ill he was to be understood as having in the slightest degree altered his opinon as to its principle; but, on the other hand, he was hound to say that, having given an assurance to the Government that, so far as he was conerned he would give no farther opposition to the Bill, he could not depawrt from that assurance. It was impossible for him, therefore, to vote for his noble friend's motion, and it was eoualiy impossible for him to VOtb in favour oF the Bill. lie should therefore abstain from votingaltogether. The Earl of WICKLOW said it would be in the recoUec tion of the House that previous to going into committee on this Bill he moved, on the part of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, that their petition to be heard by counsel at the e measure should be complied with. In mak- he took occasion to refer to a statement made in the other IHouse of Parliament by the late Secretary for Ireland (Mr. Horsman), as containing an exaggerated account of the funds in the hands of the commissioners, and he intimated that possibly the majority obtained in the Rouse of Commons had been very materially influenced by such a statement coming from so high an authority aS the late Secretary for Ireland. In manking those remarks he at the same time observed that he did not mean to impeach, in the slightest degree, the integrity of the right hon. gentleman, as he believed that he considered the documents on which he based his statement to be perfectly authentic; but this expression of his confidence in the right hon. gentleman's integrity did not appear in thepublishedreport of his speech. Mfr. Trorsman, On seeing his ob6ervations in the papers, wrote to im on the subject, and a correspondence took place which ended in his (the Earl of Wicklow) seeing the accounts and locuments on which the right hon. gentleman made his statement in the House of Commons; and he was, after seeing them, perfectly convinced that there was nothing in the statement made by the right hon. gentleman which was not taken directlyfrom the publicaccounts before him. To explain the manner in which these accounts came into his hands Mr. Horsman sent hima letter which he would take the libertyto readtothe House. [The noble earl here read aletterfromnMr.Horsman. Itstated, ineffect, that animnortantcircumstance had been kept from the knowledge of his lordship, that onthe 29th of May, when the House of Commons went into committee on the Bill, Mr. Hamilton, one ofthe members for the University of Dublin, took him aside In the course of the evening, and, showing him papers with which he had been furnished by the commissioners to make an explanatory st4ement, said it would be more agreeable to the commissioners if that statement was made by him (Hr. Horsmnan) ; that in this request he acquiesced, and wrote dow n from fMr. Hamiliton's dictation the statement he was to make on the part of the commissioners to the House; that Mr. Hamilton assured him this course would be perfectly satisfactory to the commissioners if he would undertake it, and that on this assurance he made the statement on behalf of the commissiouers to the surprise of many of his friends; that he was much surprised when he saw that the Earl of Wicklow had alluded to the subject in the House of Lords as he could not bring himself to believe that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, on whose behalf his lordship spoke, were capable of so gross a breach of faith after the assurance he had received that his statement would be perfectly satisfactory to them.] Now, hehad.appeared before their lordships the other evening, and made use of documents, at the instance of the commissioners, and to him it was perfectly incomprehensible, after reading the papers which he held in his band, how the commisioners could have thought of renewing the attack, or of asking him to do so. (Hear, hear.) lr. Horsman expressed his surp'ise but his surprise was not greater than w or he need hardly say that if he had known of such an arrangemnent as had been entered into with the right lion, gentleman he would not have taken the part which he did the other evening. (Elear, hear,) He coultd assure their lordships that it would be a long time before he took charge of a case again. ("Hear, hear," and a lar4gh.) Earl GRA?NVILLE said nothing could be more fair, more candid, more consistent with the noble earl's character, than the statement which ho had just made. (ERear.) - He (Lard Granville) had been much annoyed when the noble earl made the accusation against Mr. Horsman, and would have replied to it immediately, but was desirous of ascertaining the facts from Mr. Horsman. Upon doing so he found that that gentleman had put himself into communication with the noble earL and the result had been the honourable and satisfactory explanation which they had just heard. With respect to the Bill itself the noble earl (Derby) said he left the further defence of it to Her Majesty's Government. He (Lord Granville) did not intend to enter upon any defence, but, as the noble earl opposite had announced his intention of dividing the House, he thought the circumstances under which that division would take place were not unfavourable. After n few words from the Marquis of WESTMEATHE urging the withdrawal of the amendment, the House divided, when there appeared Contents ... . ... ... ... 24 Non-contents... ... ... ... ... 7 Majority ... ... ... ... -17 The Bill was then read a third time and passed.

DE. M'MAHON asked the right. hon. member for Droitwich when the commission appointed to inqutire Into the. present arrangements for transacting the judicial bu-iness, C1ivi and criminal, of the superior coutsr was likely to mtake its report; and. whether he had any expectation that such report might be made in time to have a measure founded upon it introduced in the present session ? Sir J. PA INGTON repled that the Common L%w Commission were now considering their report, 'which he hbd no doubt would be presented before the termination of the present sessien. He was afraid that he was hardly able to answer the latter part of the hon. and learned gentleman's question, because he did not yet know what amount of legislation the Common Law Commission might recommend, nor what might be the duration of tho prcsent session. LIFE ASSURANCE. Mr. K. SEYMER asked the Secretary of the Treasury whether he intended to name a day for the introduction of his promised measure on life assurance ? Mr. WILSON was very anxious to bring in this Bill, but as it was likely to givc rise to some discussion it was very undesirable that it should be introduced at an unseasonable hour. He should have wished to bring in the Bill that evening, but the crowded state of the notice paper rendered it improbablethat he could do so before midnight, and he wasafraid that hon. members would object to its being proceeded with so late. LAND-TAX COLLECTOPRS. Mtr. WILSON having moved that the House at its rising adjourn until Monday, Mr. W. WILLIAbIS asked the FirstLordof theTreasury whether borough members were to have an equal right with county members to recommend persons for appointment as Land-Tax Collectors? He asked the question, because having recently recommnended some of his constituents as fit for that situation, a letter was sent to him from the Treasury stating that the recommendations ought to have been signed by a member for the county of Surrey. Hle had been a member of that Hiouse 20 years, and that was the first occasion on w hich he discovered that there was any distinction between the privileges of borough and county members. Lord PALMERSTON said, the distinction between county and borough membera with reference to the matter alluded to by the hon. gentleman was not arbitrarily established by the Government, nor did it depend upon the Government to enfore or relax it. It was established by an Act of Parliament, and so long as that Act continued in force he apprehended that Her ajesty's Government had no choice but to obey the law. He could not say upon what ground the distinction was established, nor could he say why a borough member, and especially his hon. friend the member for Lambeth (laughter), ought not to have equally vith county members the privilege of recommending persons for the appointment in question. He could not at present say whether he should support any BiU that his hon. friend might introduce to abolish the distinetion. DISTRIBUTION OF THE VICTORIA CROSS. Sir C. NAPIER hoped that the House would not regard him as too fastidious if he should make some remarks upon the review that took place that morning in Hyde Park. (Laughter4) He saw the Artillery, the Cavalry, the Guards, the Line, and the Marines weU represented at the review. but the Navy of the greatest maritime Power in the world was represented by the First Lord of the Admiralty and about 50 sailors. (Laughter.) He spoke more in sorrow than in anger when he said that that was not a fair treatment of our brave sailors; and he hoped that if ever such a rbview again took place the Admiralty would endeavour to bring up as many sailors as they could possibly bring together. We must be badly off, indeed, if at lems: 1,000 or 1,500 seamen could not be collected Instead of presenting themselves in their blue jackets and trousers they ought to come forward armed with their light gnus, and pass before the Queen as other branohes of the service. He believed that during the late war our sailors did their duty as weU as anybody else (cheers), and especially at Sebastopol, whero they were exposed to the greatest danger and labour and suffering in the trenches; and if war shoald break out again, they would again be ready to do their duty, On such a review, therefore, as had taken place that day, proper respect ought to be showvn by the authorities to the British Navy. There were no boys to represent the navy that day in Hyde Park, and, in fart, it was the poorest display that he had ever seen in hs life as far as the Navy was concerned. Colonel FRENCO thought that tho First Commissioner of Works was entitled to great praise for the admirable arrangements which he had made in so short a time to enable the public to witness the seno at Byde Park that day. (Cheers.) JrUDICIAL REFORMS IN INDIA. Sir E. PERRY rose to ssk the President of the Board of Control whether, on the reference to India of the judicial reforms proposed by Her ajesty's Commissioners, it was competent to the Legislative Council in India to reject thoso reforms altogether, even though the Home Government approved them; and whether it was true that the Legislative Council, consisting of nine Company's servants and two Queen's judges, claimed to act as an independent Legislature ? He said that something was occurring in India at tho present moment-a branch of the Government there was pursuing a course of conduct which. he believed, would be found most prejudicial to the good of that country. In 18.33 it was thought right at once to reform tho courts of justice, and Mr. Macaulay drew up a scheme of a law commission in India, which sat 20 years. cost the State 500 0001., and the result of whose sittings was absolutely nothing. This fact had been distinctly recorded by Parliament when legislating on the subject of India three years ago; and, such being the case, the Government determined, with the sanction of the House of Commons, to make at once a complete reform in the Indian law courts, and the present First Lord of the Admirnlty announced that they had resolved on putting the Com- any's courts of justice under the Queen's judges in India. Tae right hon. gentleman, on that occasion, said he was exceedingly anxious to embody such a provision in the Bill, but he found it necessary to postpone any Legislative measure until the report of a commission. A commiaeion was therefore appointed consisting of most eminent men, and at the end of two years they presented a report which had received the sanction of the most distingLished jurists in this ccuntrz', Wheon, however, legislation was expectd here as the resull. of the commission, a paper was circula&t a mong metbers of Parliament, to the great surprise of- J 'who were interested in this question, stating thiat the Court of Directors had transmittid this report to India for tbh Purpose of obtaining the opinion of the Government there, Upon it. It appeared now, from what had taken pIle in ad ia, that instead of transmitting their ophnions iaon VIa reforts propose,dwhich he admitted wo be en itled to,dut consideration-the Legislative Council were undertakingto legislate upon the subject. They were doing even morethan this, for they were setting aside the determination ot the home Government and were about, if not stopped, topss an Act which cotld be productive of notbin btut tDmitigated evil in India-they 'were going to put Bntish ettlert. in India under the Company's unreformed courts which had so long been denounced. Now, he wished to know, if the.- Legslative Council had really taken upon themselves to. overrule the determination of the home Government, what. course his right hon. friend proposed to pursue? Since, the crestion of the Legislative Council that body had beetL laying claim to almnoet uncontrollable powers of legislation The late Governor-General, iLord Dalhousie, had not counte. nanced these claims, and he (Sir B. Perrv) should like to.- know what his right hon. friend's views were on this insportant question. Mr. V. SMITH said, it was true there had been a lawcommission-a very expensive one, and that from it h-d: emanated many reports which had never been acted upon. It wa-s also uite true that in 1853, during the discussion. upon the Inqdi BIll, his rigbht hon. firiend (Sir C. Wcod stated that his opInion was in fiavour of amaIgsmaiofthqL Sudder Court and the Sapreme Conrt in Calcutta, ind. ing, however, that inquiry was necessary before any steps. could be taken in the matter, a commissionwas appointed to consider this question, and at the end of three years aformat report was made by it. When this report was submittedt, him upon first taking his present office, he came to the con. clusiori that the best course was to send it out to India forconsideration by the Government there. He wax never more satisfied on any subject than with the perfeot wid)n of this proceeding, because he heard from the GovernarGeneral that, if he had done otherwise, he would hw e, affronted the whole Legislative and Executive Council of Ind (Hear.) He would remind them that the Legislative Council was established afterimuch deliberation in thin House by the Act of 1853. It was an attempt to providesomething like representative authority for India. Hear.) Of course it was utterly im,cossible that they could have a. representative Government in that country, but Parliament intended in 1853 to malke a nearer approach towards something like representation in that Council than previouslexisted. Was it expedient that his first official at shoLld. tend to setthat Coundilat nought,andtowetuphiaowxL fpse dixit founded upon the report of the eoomimeaon? HE' contended that to have done so wouldhbabeen an act of the.- greatest foUy and imprudenoe. Accordingly be sent out Acts on the subject of these judicial reforms, directing that they should be submitted to the Legislative Counci rwho. were probably on such subjects much better able to leg'slate for India thau the E[ouse of Commons. Hd such Act& been proposed in this House every lawyer woulad be Stait ng up to make objections to them, and he would appea to hishon. and learned friend whether, after his elsri. once of this House he thought they should be able tD>secure anything like an attendance of members for the cnnsideration of such a subject ? (Hear, hear.) He thought, therefore, he was perfectly justified in the course he ha, pursued, and he was glad to hear this impression confirmed m another place by one of the highest authorities upon India-a noble earl who had fllled the office of GovernorGeneraL Fortified by such authority, he thought it would: have been most inexpedient in him to sebmit to the, House of Commons Acts which might afterwards have metwith the reprobation of the Legislative Council of India. (Hear, hear.) Of course that Council had power to rejecfthese Acts, but he shoull not tell his hon. and leIrnee friend what course he should pursue in such a ease until he. knew what had actuaUy passed in the Council. This, however, he would tell his hon. and learned fdend:-If the Legislative Council passed Acts which, in his opinion, were prejudicial to the good government of India, he wo:iulannul those Acts; and if he could not induce this body to amend them, he would then, and not until them. -not until he had exhausted every other meanscall upon Parliament to legislate upon the subject_ It was not supposed, however, that whenever a conflict oPopinion took place between the Home Government and the' Legislative Council those gentlemen were to be dismissed - and such was his (Mr. Smlth's) opinion of the civil service, of India that he believed, if he were to dismiss the Iegisla. tive Council under such circumstances, it would not be easyto find gentlemen to fill their places. (Hear.) Measures of iudicial reform would no doubt be passed in good time. perhaps rather slower than he and hig hon. and learned. friendF might wish, owing tothe cautious habit of that body, uired a period of three months to elapse betwasn 'he secound reading and the committee of a Bi*; but tkat theCouncilvwould pass sueh a measure as wouldbepalatableand agreeable to the whole of India he had no doubt, and, if they did so, that measure would become law. Mr. WILLOUGHBY concurred generally in the remarks' of the right hon. gentleman the President of the Board ofControl, and could not help observing that, probably, no mat was less fitted to be a guide in the matter of Indi.n .wreform than the hon. and learned member for Devon pr(fl ear,t and a laugh); for perhaps the three evils wh ch most seriously afflicted India were English law, Englisin lawyer, andc the English language as the medium for the' administration of justioe. (Hear, hear.) His main object: in rising, however, was to ask the noble lord at the head ofthe Government whether he could not fix a day for the renewal of the debate which had been adjourned on Tuesdaylast? Considering tho gross misstatements which had beemmade with regard to the government of the East Ind Com. pany, and reflecting upon an honourable body of servants. who were not there to defend themselves, he thought that a. resumption of the debate was imperatively called for. (Cries of "O rder P') He would not trespass further oni te time ofthe House, but would rest satisfied with having called the, attention of the noblelord to the real urgency of a fuil discussion on the affairs of India, remindinghim that the question involved was not merely whether India could supplvEngland with cotton, but whether India were well or ilE governed. (Hear. hear.) Lord A. V. TEMPEST supported the request of the hon. gentleman who had just sat down, because, as motions on the. ballot and civil the service superannuation were appointed for Tuesday next. to adjouruthe debate on the motion of the!hon. member for Stockport to that day was, in fact, equivalent to adjourning it sinedie. Sir G. GREY reminded the House that the motion foradjourning the debate had not been made by the Govern ment but by his hon. and learned friend the member forDevonport; and according to the custom in such cases, the, member who moved the adjournment had fixed the d%y forresuming the debate. It was difficult for the Governmeat:~ in the present state of public business to appoint a day forthe purpose, and he thought that it was premature to tals_ about another day for renewing the debate before itwas ascertained that it could not be resumed on Tuesday. next, THE ORDNANCE SURVEY. Mr. LIDDELL said, that the county of Durhanshad beern already surveyed on the 25-inch scale, but in conseqaeace of the vote come to the other evening ion the motion of the hon. member for Mallow he believed that the Government had determined that no publication of the maps should take place on that large scale. He begged to ask the Secretary (or the Treasury, however, whether it would be c;nmpetent for the proprietors of land in that county, upon payment of all the requisite expenses, to obtain maps on tbat large scale? He also wished to ask whether there would be, any objection to furnishing a return of the names of theL parishes and places in theo counties of Northumberland and Darham which had been surveyed on the 25-inch scale distinguishing those portions of the survey which had been, already published from those which had not been published 2 From what occurred the other night with respect to the Scotch survey he understood that it never had been ina tended to publish maps for general use upon the 25-inch scale, but that they were only to be obtained upon special. application. He thought it right, therefore, to acquaint. the Secretary for the Treasury that he had been informed, upon authority which he could not question, that in the, counties of Peebles and Ayr maps were now published aud exposed for general sale upon that large scale. Mr. WILSON said, there would be no objection to give it return of the parishes in Durham and Northumberlam 6 which had been surveyed on the 25-inch scale, and there, could be no doubt that in regard to the parishes surveyed on the 25-inch scale the landowners could get copies of them on payment of the necessary expenses for the parp'r.seHe stated the other night that the publication of certain. maps would be made ia the coarse of the present year, but in consequence of the alteration of the scale some farther time must elapse before the publication. The motion for the adjournment of the House till Mn layr was then agreed to. PROBATES AND LETTERS OF ADMMfSTIURA- TION BILL. The ATTORN-EY-GENERAI4 in rmoving the second reading of this Bill, said, it would be altogether superfluousz for him to dilate on the evils aud grievances attending thecontinuance of the emclesiastioal courts. Those evils h .d been so long admitted, had been the subject of so many reports of committees of that House and of the other Honse of Parliament, and had formed matter of inquiry for so many commissions, that he might well assume that therewould be found no difference of opinion with respet tothem. In fact, for nearly 30 years different Government: had attempted to accomplish the change now proposed, aDdi unquestionably tbese courts would have long since sic. cumbed to the attacks made on them if their assailats ha I not been divided in opinion as to the edifice to beerected iD, the place of that which all were unanimous' r agreed to pull down, He should, however, in a few obssrv- tions caU the attention of the EHouse to the state of the, existing law in order that the House might be enabled tb judge how far the provisions of the present Bill met ths necessities of the case and were calculated to remove the evils complained of. The House was aware that anterior tothe Statute of Wills of 1837, a remarkable difference existel between wiUs of personal estate and wiU s of landed p -a. perby, A will of personal estate needed no attestation, and' a most informal docum ent might be admitted to pro'ate,. whilo a wiU of real estate required to be attested bythree witnesses and executed with peculiar solemnity. In; 1837 an Act was passed taking away altogether thtw diinction, and requiring that aU w is, whether relatiu,; to person-.l estate or to real estate, should be executed aut attested in the same manner and with the samne solemnity. It might naturally have been expected that instrameaussubject to the same forms and regulations would be subjectr to the same tribunals foradjudication-namely, the ordinary tribunals of the laud; but a gliing and m ishievor, anomaly was allowed to continue, namely, that whle there was bnt one single form aco rding to which wis mlust be made, there were, nevertbeless, two tribunals to whichthe must be submitte 'with respect to th$ir valdity-firs, am personal property, and be readily executed anywhere within the four corners of the kingdom. There niight be a good deal of disputation as to the construction of wills and the administratiou of assets, but the ainount of really contentious business in regard to wills was praotically found to be almost infinitesimal. He rejoiced, therefore, that the Government had tow directed their attention to the discovery of a conver,ient mode of conducting the common form business, because it had hitherto been too much the habit of our great jurists to overlook this, which was, after all, the most important branch of the question, and to allow their views to be moulded chiefly by their own experience in the contentiotus cases. In fact, this circumstance accounted to a great extent for the failure of many previous attempts at legislation of this description. Another matter of complaint was the evil connected with the doctrine ef bona notaWbia, which loudly called for a remedy, ald which this Bill would entirely set to rights. This measure would also furnish an index which would enable parties to find out where wills that had been proved and administered had been taken out; and thus the frightful expfense incident tosearching here and there, and employing attorneys to perform all those blessed journeys (a laugh) vhich often ended in nothing but vexation and disappointnifnt, would be wholly got rid of. He regretted that advantage was not taken of the vast depository of information at Somerset House, by means of which that excellent public officer, Mr. Trevor, stated that parties conld easily learn, at the cost of Is., where any will proved or administered within the 1ast 40 yfars had been taken out. If this could be grafted upon the Bill, a great boon would be conferred upon the present generation, and the public saved from an endless amount of trouble. (Hear, hear.) Another valuable feature of this measure was that it fully recognized the advantage of local jurisdiction witbin given limits. The people ought to have faciities for dealing with wills and administering them brought as far as possible home to their own doors. (Hear.) In turning his attention to the commuon form business,as the hon. and learned Attorney-General had done, he had avoided the rock on which so many of his predecessors in this enterprise had split. No doubt changes such as those now proposed must create a great deal of disturbance, but he believed this Bill would effect them with as little injury aa might be to existing rights. It was wiser to pass a measure which would effect a great practical benefit than to strive unsuccessfully for something v'hich might be more theoretically perfect, as the'House had striven on this suibject for the last 30 years. (Hear, hear.) The Bill of the hon. and learned gentleman contained the principal alterations which he (Mr. Henley) had for years wished to see effected in the granting of probates and administration of wills, and he thought that the House and the country were mnuch indebted to the hon. and learned gentleman for propounding a practical measure 'which would in all likelhood receive the approbation of the Legislature, rather than one more theoretically perfect which would be rejected. (Cheers.) There was a question of detail with regard to the constitution of the proposed Court of Probate upon which he wished to observe, that when the Bill came to be discussed in committee it might be well for the House to consider whether or not the Admiraty Court should be amalgamated with the Court of Probate. Every precaution should be taken for securing the means of takimg care of property during litigation. As to the procedure of the I r osed court, he, of course, must leave that matter to be de0at with by the legal members of the House. He would, bowever, observe that he hoped the sanguine expectation of the hon. and learned gentleman as to the simplification of the process would be fulfilled. The hon andlearned gentleman had stated that the length of the process would be diminished one-balf by his Bill, and sangume as was his expectation ia that respect he (Mr. Henley) must say that nobody was more capable than the hon. and learned gentleman of providing an effectual remedy for any evil to which ho nnight direct his attention. He hoped that part of the provision with respect to the transmission of wills by which the title to property was to be proved would remain open for further consideration. (Rear.) People living in the country were very jealous about the custody of their documents of title. He was quite sure that the Bill would not facilitate the proof of their titles, and he 1berefore hoped that those documents would be allowed to remain where they were. (Hear, hear.) Many of them affected the title of a poor man to a small cottage, and if all the wills of the country were to be hustled together and sent to London such a man could have littla hope of vindicating his rights. The clause on that subject was rather obscurely drawn. He had received many communieatious from persons living in the country on the subject of the Bill, from which it was evident that they assumed that aU wills, both past and to come, were to be kept in the district in which the property affected by them was situate. On no point were people living in the country more anxious than on their documents of title being easily accessible. (Hear, bear.) It was more important that wills made up to this time than those to be made hereafter should be thus accessible, because the probates of the latter would, under this Bill, be admitted as evidence with regard to the property affected by them. In speaking upon the question of compensation the bon. and learned gentleman had altogether omitted to notice the cdaim of the proctors practising in the courts out of London to compensation. He (Wr. Henley) had no complaint to make of the manner in which be had dealt with the claim of the London proctors. Those practising in the country he believed were very few, and chiefly in Chester, York, and Exeter. They were not solicitors as well as proctors, and this Bill, therefore, would deprive them of all their business. He hoped that the Bouse would consider their claim to compensation in a fair and liberal spirit. With regard to the proctors practising in London, he confessed that after having sat on commissions and committees on this subject he could not undertake to say whether they would lose or gain by the proposed change. The observations of the hon. and learned gentleman on that point ought to be received with some reservation, and he hoped that the Government would not preclude the House from freely discussing it. The Bill would take away from the London proctors a class of bDsiness which was w holly irrespective of the amount bequeathed, that was to say, all wills relating to the funded property of the country. Under the present system every will relating to funded property, whether of large or small amount, had to be proved in London. That class of wills undoubtedly gave a great deal of business to the London proctors. He should have been disposed to open the profession to solicitors, but the testimony which he had heard convinced him that the safety of the public would be best consulted by keeping it as it was. (Hear.) That testimony conclusively established the fact that the present limited body of practitioners stood even-handed between the court and the client-that if the proctor observed anything in the will brought to him by his client upon which he thought there rested the shadow of a shade of suspicion, he directed the attention of the court to it, feeling that, as an officer of the court, it was his duty to do It migbt be very difficult for the judge of the court to be wetI acquainted with the cbaracter of each of the 150 proctors who practised in his court, but. if the business were to be thrown open to 10,000 or 11,000 solicitors, how was it possible for him to acquire such a knowledge of their moral reputation as would justify his reposing that confidence in them which he might welU repose iU the present limited number of the practitioners ? The evidence was irresistible as to the great security with which the common form business had been hitherto transacted, and he did not think it would be wibe to disturb the existing system for the sake of the imaginary advantage of opening the business to solicitors. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said he had omitted to mention that a distinction should be recognized between the proctore of York and Chester aud those of London, and that be thought they stood upon a different footing. (Hear,bhear.) He had neglected, also, to point out that there was another class of persons entitled to the greatest consideration-he meant those clergymen who acted as surrogates, and who would be converted into commissioners by the Bill. (Hear, hear.) Perhaps the House would also allow hinm to state that a provision was introduced into the Bill for disposing of contentious cases, where the amounts involved were very small, through the agency of the County Courts. (Hear.) DIr. COLLIER intended to support the second reading of ihis Bill, believiLng it would be a very great improvement upon the existing state of things, anything worse than which, indeed, it was difficult for the imagination to conceive. He would not dwell upon the mierits of the measure: they had already been ably pointed out; but he felt bound to say that it possessed very serious defects-so serious, in fact, that if he did not think they could be remedied in committee it would be impossiblefor himtosupport the Bil at all. Elis objections were twofold. In the first place, he deemed it unnecessary to create a naw court at all; and, in the second place, the court which was about to be created was an inefficient one. (Hear.) He was justified in supposing that this was not the Attorney-Generals Bill, though, having it in charge, his hon. and learned friend, of course, felt bound to say all he could in its favour. The Bill introduced by his hon. and learned friend last year was not only a different Bill, but might be said to be diametri- Mll se to-ro one beoeth ose ht-a h ea"l n^^ dA to ble a-_ Ht_ ous........ A .T.h.at ._as''h i,>upseat tne on before theEos.Tawsth largest-this might ho described as the smallestpossible measure. The Bill of his hon. and learned friend proposed to consolidate three ji risdictionsrespecting wills-the Jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts which related to the validity of wills in personalty, the jurisdiction of the Courts of Common Law in wills involving realty, and the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery, which related to the administration of assets real and personal. Ilis hon. and learned friend proposed to unite thesethreejurisdictions,and if that proposal bad been acceded to undoubtedly anew court with a new judge would have been required. Whatever nmight have been its defects-and of those, as the Bil was dead and gone, he would not speak-this was a bold and comprehensive idea; the measure was throughout conceived in no narrow orpettifogging spirit, and was not unworthy of his hon. and learned friend's great reputation. The present, however, was, he repeated, the smallest possible measure. Instead of consolidating three jurisdictions, it dealt only with onethat of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and actually cut that in two, giving the greater and more important part of it to the coUrts of common law, and reserving the residue for a new judge. It called into existence a new court with all its paraphernalia, saddling the country witb precisely the same pecuniary burden as the measure of last year, whereas it would transact only a small portion of the business arising out of one of the three jurisdictioDs which the other Bil united. It established a new judge and a new court for the purpose of dealing wtth a portion only of the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courtr-namely, that which related to non-contentious matters, aud some questions of law ; while all the important issues on the great questions of fact, such as the sanity of the testator, Ihe question whether undue iDfluence was exercised upon him, whether the will was a forgery, or whether it was duly executed, were not to be tried by the new juldge, but by the courts of common law. (Hear, hear.) This Bill perpetuated wbat he thought might be described as the game of battledore and shttlecock-well-known in our judicisl systet-.. whereby a suitor was with a good deal of noise knocked about fromn court to court, generally losing a portion of his feathers at each flight. ('- Hear, bear," and the new court, with its affidavits and interromatories 'which the proctors would take care to maintain as long- as pyssible; next he would be sent into a common law coart. then he could come back into the Court of Probate, and the cbances were that Chancery would claim hbia besides. Now, he contended that if the suitor in aU important cases was to go to the courts of common law in the end he might just as well go there at once. (Esear, hear.) There was no necessity for a new court to try cases of no great importance, referriDg all great questions of fact which arose io the courts of common law. (E[ear, hear.) In place of this, he proposed that the courts of common law should transact all contentious business. and that aU the non-contentiouu businems should be disposed of, not by a new judge, but by an office and a registrar with a salary-say, of 1,5001. a-year. Such an officer would be able to transact satisfactorily all the comnmon form business, while the contentious business would bs transferred at once to the superior court of common law. tHear.) Among the complaints made esspecting the adrnimstrationof justice in this countrybe hbdnever heard it said that we did not possess a sufficient number of courts. There were Courts of Common Lair, Courta of Chancery, Ecclesiastical Courts, Courts of Bankruptcy and Insolvency, County Courts, Courts of Quarter Session, and what not, and it was owing to the conf'ict of their jurisdiction that much of the scandal attaching to our law arose, and that such expense, and occasionally ruin, were inflicted upon suitors. They had recently vitnessed an example of this conflict of jurisdictions in the struggle between Chancery and Bankruptcy for the carcase of the Royal British Bank. Well, at this moment a commission was sitting to inquira whether the 15 common law judges should not be reduced in number, because they. bad not enough to occupy them in consequence of the County Courts having taken aray a great part of their jurisdiction; and it would be a strange thing to create a sixteenth judge at the very moment when this commission mnight say that 15 were too many. (Hear, hear.) If the House came to consider this matter. what was there with respect to a Will of greater interest and complexity, or which made it more diTicult to deal with, than a deed or contract, or any instrument whereby a man disposed of his property during his life? The civil law drew no such distinction, instituted no peculiar mode of proceading with respect to a will, and created no privileged or monopolizing practitioners in will cases. In no other civilized country, indeed, besidae our own was such a distinction recognized. In America the County Courts dealt with wills; in India no courts of robate, no doctors, no proctors existed, and his hon. and learued friend the late Chief Justice (Sir B. Perry) would probably bear him out in saying thut no difficulty was found there in transaoting the testamentary businesa by the ordinary tribunals, But there was as example nearer home. About 30 years ago the Commissary Courts of Scotland, which succeeded the old Ecclesiastical Courts of that country, were abolished precisely as they now proposed to abolished the Ecclesiastical Courts in England. Was anew court created to fill their place? Not so. The Sootch would not endure, would not pay for (a laugh) any new tribunal. The jurisdiction was transferred to the ordinary tribunals of the country-to the Sheriff's Court and to the Conrt of Session-and he should be very much surprised indeed to hear from any Scotch member that these tribunals were incompetent for the business transferred to them, and that a new court was desiderated. He wanted to know why the Courts of Westminster-hail sbould not do in Eugland what the Courtof Session could do in Scotland ? (Hear, hear.) Ho said, then, thst there was no necessity for a new court, but that this jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Court was in the natmue of a diseased excrescence upon our judicial system, which a healthy action would remedy and absorb. The Lord Chancellor, in introducinga Bill very nearly similar to this, last session, said:- "' Under the measure I propose the judge of the court will bave really next to nothing to do. The registrars wiU in ordinary cases determine whether a new wiU is in force or not, appealing to the judge for vssistance whenever they require it, and when a question oi fact arises-for example, whether the testator were a man of sound mind, or whether the will was duly executed-I propose that such questions should be dealt with exactly in the same manner as an issue is directed by the Court of Chancery to be tried in a coart of law, and that nothing shall be done by the judge, except sending them wherever they can most conveniently C tried . . . . This being the case I cannot honestly propose the creation of a Dvew judge." bat was on the 10th of Febmuy this year; yet, now, in June, a judge was proposed who would confessedly have next to nothing to do. The Lord ChanceUor, in introdaciog the present Bil had been induced, he believed, to propose the new court and new judge against his better jadgment. Indeed, the noble and learned lord stated that the suggestion had been forced upon him; but he still expressed his opinion that the new judge would not have enough to do. That being so, he made the new functionary assistantjudge in the Divorce Court; but, even then, he would not have sufficient to occupy him, and so, some time or another, although when was not stated, the Admiralty jurisdiction also was to be given to him, and then it was supposed that he would have something to do. But what a medley of jurisdictions was given to this court wills. ships, and marriages; what on earth had they to do vwith one another? They might jast as well take the varioas branches of our law alphabetically and refer them in threes to different jurisdictions,-thus, bankruptcy, burglary, bills of exchange, or poachig, parish law, and piracy. (A laut,h.) Or they might shake up aU the jurisdictions in a big and put them together three at a time, just as they came out: the systema would be quite as sensible and inteUigible as the one now proposed. (Hear, hear.) But this did not seem to him to be the plan on which they ought to proceed, and to legislate upon such a principle-if principle it could be called-did not say much for the hopefulness of the cause of law reform. It was most important for the purpose of reducing to order and harmony the entangled system of our laws, not merely to look to the exigency of immediate operations, hut to take a comprehensive view of the entire judicial system and to deal with each part in reference to the harmony of the whole. (Hear.) Hpon a review of the main provisions of this Bill, then, he thought that he was justified in saying that it saddled the country with a new court where a new court was not necessary; that the court which it provided would not be an efflcient one, and that the judge of that court, if he were a man of active mind and had a great appetite for intellectual and judicial nutriment, would be starved-that he would be fed upon husks and straw while the fatted calves of litigation would be devoured by others. ("H Fear," and a laugh.) He (hlr. Collier) should endeavour by means of amendments in committee to reduce that new court to an office with a registrar, and to refer the whole of the contentions business to the Courts of Common Law. That would be in accordance with the Bill which he had introduced four years ago, whEich had often received the active assistance of his hon. and learned friend the Solicitor-General, and he was sure that the fact of his hon. and learned friend being now in office wvould snake no difference in: his opinion. There were other points of detail to which he ohjected,-such, for example, as the double appeal, first to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and then to the House of Lords He objected, also, to the jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty being givenato the new court, because he was of opinion that it ought to be transferred to the Court of Common Law. With respect to the local administration of the law it was undoubtedly most important that the County Courts should have jurisdiction with respect to probates where the property was sm,all; and the Bill, although for contentious business it adopted the County Court districts, strangely enough, for nOn-contentions business adopted the diocesan districts. In commtttee he should move a resolution to the effect that w ith respect to the local administration of this portion of the law the County Court districts should be adhered to both in the case of contentious and non-contentious business. and he did not believe that his hon. and learned friend the attorney-General would oppose that proposition, seeing that he had given his assent to it last year. (Hear, hear.) lHe would endeavour to enforce his view in committee that there should be a complete sweeping away with the cumbrous jurisdiction t f the Ecclesiastical Courtsq, and that that jurisdiction should be transferred to the Courts of Common Law and the County CourtS. MIr. ROLT should not follow his hon. and learned friend through all the details wFhich he had brought before the House, and which wer, more fit for consideration in corn msittee, but would observe that, as a member of the comn. m ission whose recommendations the present BiUl substantially carried out, be understood that the great crying grievance requiring remedy consisted in the multiplicity of independent jurisdictions with respect to the probate of 'wills and the grants of letters of administration, and the difficulty, nay, almost practical impossibility of determining wtith anything like certainty the particular jurisdiction wihich had to deal with particular cases. That inconve. nience had been admitted for nearly the greater part of this century, but it was a grievance arising, not from any defect in the original constitution of the tribunals, or from an abuse of the jurisdiction exercised, but from the rapid increase of wealth in respect to personal property, from the formation of canals and railroads, by which the amount of personal property had been so greatly increased that the simple jurisdiction, which was amply sufficient when these tribunals were first instituted, to regulate the succession to personal property, became wholly unufit for the purpose. To meet the inconveniences arising from this state of things some remedy was of course required. Various remedies were suggested, but he would now refer to but three-viz., reducing the tribunals to one or two, and improving the jurisdiction where it was defective; transferring the jurisdiction to some one existing coart, or the creation of some new cnurt; which should deal with the whole subject. Aocord iDg to bis notions of law reform theso subjects were hardly quite ripe for discussion in that House. They were mixEd questions of law and fact, which he felt his hon. and learnedl friend and every member in that EHoute maust bs unacquainted with, unless they had taken great pains to inform themselves on the subject. It was idle to attempt to legislate on the subject without knowing the whole facts and exactly how the law was administered in these tribunals To obtain that knowledge required patient research, so that the investigation was fitter for a select committee or commission. Upoa this subject tbere was a Royal Commis- sion inl130, which reported in 1832. That was followed by a select comm'ittee of that House, by a select cmmittee of the House of Lords, and again by a select committee of the Commons; and lastly there was the Chancery Commission issued some years ago, to which a supplemental com mission was issued in 1850. This commission had all former proceedings subumitted to it, and yet, in addition, it devoted a considerable portion of time in examining witnessep, ascertaining the state of the law, and inquiring respecting the course pursued in the Ecclesiastical Courts. The constitution of the commission was nunierous and varied. It consisted of one of the Lords Justices, the Master of the Rolls, the two Vice-Chancellors, oiie judge of the Common Law Courts, the Dean of Arches, the Queen's Advocate, the Attorney-General, two gentlemen f rom the Chancery bar, the rigbt hon. mnember for Carlisle, and the right hon. member for Oxfordshire. When he mentioned as nmembers of that commission Lord Jostice Turner and ViceClsancellor Page Wood, he felt thattheir great legal knowledge and judicial impartiality afforded a suficient guax rantee that everytbing wvbich could be done would be 403d1 ba apply some proper remedy to the 1iSQQSvSuitDQoI which were felt to exist. He thought it would be a sound proceeding, in attempting law reform, for that House to consider what such a comnmission recoinmended. (Hesr, bear.) The commission cauie to tho conclusion that the nght counne to pursue was to sweep away the existing multiplicity of jurisdictions and establish one tribanal in their stead. His bon. friend said that the new tribunal would have nothing to do, but his hon. friend tota]Iy misunderstood the nature of cominon form business, for it was really business of importance, requiring great checks, great knowledge, and great experience. The first questioa to I decide was who was to be the executor to deal with the personal estate. In A Tery large proportion of casas there was either no executor named or the executor renounced the probate, or it was doubtful who was the executor. These were questions of the highest importance, and his hon. fricnd was mistaken iu supposing that it could be satisfactorily disposed of by some gentleman in an office with 1,5001. a-year. If they were to proceed in that way in effecting law reform, they would find that they would be sacrificing the rights of property. A large proportion of the common form busimess necessarily went to the judge to consider, and itmust not be supposed that, because the judge did not sit in open court for six hours every day he had therefore nothing to do. He thought it might be very possible to engraft upon the business of the testamentary court a portion of those legal proceedingswhich were based on the civillaw. Three mem- crs of the commission-the Attorney-Geieral, a right hon. baronet opposite, and the Master of the Rolls-were in favour of transferring the testamentary jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery, but the majority were opposed to such a measure; but, whether it were trans. ferred to the Court of Chancery or to a court of common law it would only become a separate department of such court, for the basiness was so considerable that it wonld afford occupation enough to a department. Whether the business were transferred to the Chancery or common law coarts, or elsewhere, there would necessarily be a now and distinct department with its own officers. The commissioners, after carefully considering the subject, arrived at the conclusion that it was not desirable to transfer the jurisdiction either to the Courts of Chancery or common law, but that the best course would be to create a new and independent court, wbich should deal with the whole of the business, and he would oppose any attempt vwhich might be made in committee to prevent the establishment of such a tribunaL There werevcertainly some provisions of the Bill which he did not fully approve, but he thought the time had arrived when hon. members ought to be prepared to sacrifice their, opinions as to matters of detail in order to carry into effect a great reform which would sweep away the existing nau1l! tiplicity of jurisdictions and establish a single jurisdiction in their stead. (Hear, hear.) One question of considerable importance which had been mentioned during this discussion vvas that of compensation. (Rear, hear.) He believed there was no reason to fear tho rejection of this measurel because it provided some compensation for those -who would sustain loss in consequence of the legal reform which it would accomplish, and he bad no doubt the noble lord at the head of the Government would be grateful to the lIouse if it enabled him to do justice to those whose interests would be affected. (Hear, hear.) He considered that compensation ought to be afforded to a greater extent than was contemplated by the Bill in its prestnt form. (Eear, hear.) If he could agree with the Attorney-General that the object of the measure wu to secure a monopoly to the proctors, he, for.one,would oppose such a monopoly. He denied, however, that the office of proctor was a monopoly. It would bo as reasonable to speak of his hon. and learned friend's monopolizing the office of Attorney-General as to speak of the monopoly of their offices by the proctors. Those gentlemen were officers of a court and if they were abohshed to-morrow a new body of clerks or officials must be created, under some other name, to supply their places. The only question would be whether or not the new officials should receive the same fees as the proctors. It was absolutely necessary, when many thousands of wills were proved annually, that a body of officials should exist whose experience enabled them to detect attempts at fraud, and to advise upon the nice questions which were constantly arising. Parliament might transfer the business to others if they pleased, bat the judge of the court would find it necessary to appoint officials who would perform the duties of proctors under gome other name. He believed that if the House was satisfied this neasure would deprive the proctors of a considerable portion of their business to the detriment of the public, they, as well as the Government, would. be repared to do justice to those gentlemen. This subject ad received long and careful consideration. The present Bill was the fourth measure relating to testamentary jurisdiction which had been introduced since 1852, and he hoped the House would be of opinion the time had arrived when any petty difference as to questions of detail should be disregarded, and when an attempt should be made to remedy the serious grievances which resilted from the existing multiplicity of jurisdictiosn. (H[ear, lear.) He wished, before he sat down, to correct a misapprehension on the part of the Attomney-General, who, as he understood, stated that a Bil previously introduced on this subject had been opposed by the proctors because it only proposed to afford them compensation to the extent of onehalf the amount of their receipts. If he (Mr. Rolt) was correctly informed, the proctors, although they did not tbink that measure harmonized with the report of the commissioners, did not as a body offer any opposition to it, but would have been perfectly content if it had passed. He hoped the House would assent to the second reading of the present Bill, and that it would receive such amendments in committee as would ensure its passing into a law. Mr. COLLIER observed, in explanation, that when he said the new court would have next to nothing to do, he did not use his own words but those of the Lord ChanceUor. The hon. and learned gentleman seemed to suppose that he (Mr. Coller) was expressing his o wn opinion. Mr. MALISS had, on former occasions, uniformly op. posed the measures proposed on this subject by the Government; but he was able to give his support to the second reading of this Bill, which would carry into effect the views he bad advocated during the last four years. He entertained some objection to the details of the measure but thought on disputed points some arrangement might be made which would be generally acceptable when the BiU was in committee. The great evil wbich he desired to see removed was the existence of so many differentjurisdictions, amounting to some 400 in number. He had alwayt said these subjects ought no longer to be matters of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, but should, on the contrary, be dealt with by a court emanating directly from the Sovereign, as the fountain of all justice, and therefore to the proposal for a new Ceurt of Probate he gave his cordial support. He reserved to himself the right of objecting to matters of detail, and, with that reservation, gave his general support to the Bill, but upon one understanding. This was a measure which destroyed great interests, and called on many persons in the country to make great sacrifices, and he was therefore gratified to hear his hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General concede that the case of the proctors of the Prerogative Court of York was entitled to consideration in reference to the question of compensation. Those proctors of the Prerogative Court of York were a privileged body of men, vwhose offices had existed during several centuries, and who bad succeeded to their business only by slow degrees and after great pecuniary sacrifices in early life; and he said if a Bill had passed that Rouse which abolisbed the rights of such a body of men as that without awarding them compensation, it would have been anything but a creditable piece of legislation. (Hlear, hear.) He was therefore glad ibat his hon. and learned friend (the Attorney-General) had concededathe pressing nature of their claims. The principle, then, being conceded, he (Mr. Malins) came to questions of fact; and if his hon. and learned friend was right in couceding the claims of the proctors of York and Chester, it followed that he must make a similar concession where thesanme state of thiogs existed. But his hon. and learned friend had stated that he could not grant the concession with regard to the proctors in London, and gave as a reason for that distinction that the Houme could not compensate where improvements were to be made. But the principle of his hon. and learned friend was either right or wrong, and if the principle was wrong why did he compensate the proctors of York, seeing that they, too, were to be the victims of an improved practice ? Lord PALMERSTON.-Because the Bill sweeps their offices from the face of the earth. Mr. MALINS resumed-The noble lord said their offices were to be swept from tbe face of the land. Because, therefore, the proctors of York, as such, were to be swept from the land the noblo lord would award them compensation, but would refuse it to a class of men whose interests would be so damaged by the oneration of this Bill that they would hereafter earn only 1001. by their practice where they now earned 8001. These were men, about 120 in number, of station in society and of great respectability and many of whom bad large families depending upon them. They had privileges which they and those who had gone before them had enjoyed for six centuries; many of them were men of great age, some of them of middle age, aud others who were just commencing life; and was the House prepared to annibilate as it were, 120 families, and send them destitute into the world? Although the Bill preserved tothoLondon proctors the common form of business in Doctors!-commr,ns, he was convinced that the privilege they had enjoyed vwould be gone in substance, and hereafter exist only in name, and that they would be deprived of at least seven-eighths of their emoluments. If the Bill, in preserving to the London pocrs the common f orin ofb bn'si-n e_ss_, h'ad _pr'eserve to |- them the great bulk of their pmctice he (Mr. Mains) woald have been the first to say that theirs was not a case for compensation; but if it destroyed, as he subnmitted it would, the great bulk of their business, then he contended they were, on principle, as much entitled to compensation to the extent of their loss as the proctors of York, and that in a case of public nece-sity, wbere public interest required the privileges of individuaLs to be abolished, public justice also required that those whoseprivileges were abolishedshould be compensated f,.r the loss. He had that very evening presented to the House tbe petitions of two young men, one of whom had paid N401. and the ,ther "M01. premiuM, on being articled to the profession of a pruoctor, in addition to the stan,p duty of 1201. to the Governmoent in each case. Re bad seen thpse gentlemen, who had devoted seven years to tle study of their profe.ssion, and they bad stated to him that they were willing to for,go all the loss of tine they had spent in making thebmselves familiar with a profession which would nOW be practically valn. lesa ro them by the operation of this Bill, but thes appealed to the justice of the House that they should he at least reiyr hur,ed the money they expended on their entmance to it. He repeated that the effect of the Bill on the L-,odon proutoys awould be to deprive them of something like seven-eiglhths f their present enoluments. He was surprised to hear the AttorDey-Ceneral say that the London proctors would have their business increased by the present Bill. The Attorney. (Geueral proposed to throw open the contentious business iin certain eases to the profession; another class of cas. s be gave to the County Courts; and if the statement of tb- Lon,,-n uroctors -ere true, that seven eighths of their busaiess would be lost if th6 present Bill passed, it was zeassr,,hls that, like the proctors of York and Chester, they sh,I,ld receive con-pensation. He yielded to no o0.e in the desire to see this q'aestion settled, and a sii'gle C.oirt of Probate establishde. He ,hould, therefore. &upplort the second reading, but he did not thereby plgdge hinaeelf to support the f'eture stages of the DiR unless a full and fair measure of justice were uum.i@ nt-4e. L-Atliu tht Athruenev Gnral proposed to compensate the proctorxby meais of the fee fund, so as not to throir anydditional bmuthd upon tsii Eblic,' The same principle ought to be conceded by this ill, and carried out in the aameO arsner, If the hon, and and learned gentleman rwould grant fair and just comoeunation by means of the suitors' {und. there would be nothing to prevent the Bill beooming law during tIae prcsent session. Mlr. WESTREI&D said that the city of York, by its ecclesiastical jurisdiction, had to a considerable extent authoritt ever at least twice the populatioi of Scotland, and over am immense amount of real poperty. Theeacse of the proctors of York was, however, Nzoerent from that of their London brethren, In some respects they formed a body quite unique. Their tons tion haa been. unchanged sinoe the )ear 1311. Eight proctoss exisbd then, and the same number held offlce now. They took their offices by seniority. Each proctor had a clerk, and each clerk in the order of his seniority took the place of a proctor. They did not practise as attorneys, and under this Bil their occupation as proctors in York Would be entirely gone. The county of York, under this BIll, would be divided ioto four districts-the East Riding. the North Riding, certain parts of the West Riding, and the Leeds district, containing the populous towns of Leed5, Sheffield, Huddersfield, &c. The effect of the Bill would, therefore, be to impose some inOouvesience upon the resdents near York, for those who lived one or two miles from the city on one side wouldbavetogoto Hall,andthoswr who lived a mle or two on the other side would have to go to Richmond to prove their will. He was glad to hear the assuranoe given by the Attormey-Geneir that axentioar would be paid to the equitable claims of the proctors of York to compensation. Sir E. PERRY agreed in the opinion that minor differenoes must be sunk in dealingwith this question, He also thought that it would be well not to raise t'he question 'wbether one fanctionazr or anothershould be appointed judge of the new court. His objection was not so iminch to the number as to the conflicting powers and juriadintions of the exidting 400 tribunals. So far as these were local courts, vgi3 administration and probate upon simpl. terms tey did good; nor was he without apprehension that in forming one grand court the taking out of probates and administration might becore mnore expensive to the country than at present. He was glad that the views of the commissioners had not prevailed, and that juri-diction had been given in certain cases to the County Uourts. The sound principle evidently was to allow them to exercise jurisdiction, whether contentiosw 'or not, when the suitors ohose to go to the court. The Bill propoewd to appoint registrars throughout the country to give administration in non-contentious caes. Why those functionaries should not be attached at once ts the County Courts he was at alogs to imagine. These, however, were points upon which he would uot dwell, his principalobject in riFing being to say a few words upon tha claim advanecd on behalf of the proctors for compensatioi. It might be deemed an ungracious step-for anyone, but esp. ciaUy a lawvet, to stand up and answer the arguments whick bad been laid before the House upon toat subject; but, neverthelegs, he ventured to entreat the noble lord At the hesd of the Govrnument not to listen to the appeals which had been addressed to him unlegs a much stronger case were made out than anythmng which the House had yet hear The defect of the Bill of last session was that the compenution rhicb it provided for the proctors was too large, and he believed that the clause in question. was one of the main reasons of the measure being lost. He was in hopes that, iu the event of the new court being established, the proctors would succeed in acquiring a lIrgeramount of practioe than they hd bitherto enjoyed; and, if so, it would be waste of the nublic money to acode to the claim advanoed on their beaf by the hon. and learned member for Wallingford. Mr. HUDSON said, that no body of gentlemen could lie more entitled to tho consideration of the lIoue than the proctors of York. Some of them were so aged that they could not be expected to remove to London; and he begged to thank the noble lord at the head of the Government for having consented to compensate them. He wished to cll the attention of the Attorney-General to one defect inthe Bill. When the measure passed a person residineg within half-a-mile of York, if he wanted to make his wil, would have to go 50 or 60 muiles for that purpose. e trusted that York, a very ancient city, the centre of a populous district, would be named one of the places in which wiUs might be p roved. lt had long possessed that jurisdiction, which he hoped would not be taken from it nowv. The SOLICITOR-GENTERAl rose for the purpose of congratulating the [louse and the country at large upon the prospect which, judgiDg from the unanimity of sentiment which had been expressed on all -sides that evening, they now had of witnessing the accomplishment of a great measure of legal reform. It was very gratifying to see that while the hon. and learned member for Plymouth exceptad in some degree to the Bil before the House, he did not maintain that it was not calculated to get rid of the evil which it was intended to cure, but merely said that it did not effect that object in the best possible way. The hon. and lerrued gentlemau had always been of opinion that the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts should be transferred to the courts of common law ; but he ought ndt to forget the fact that n,ot one of the Bills which had been introduced for that purpose had ever been read a second time. The transfer of jurisdiction in small matters tothe County Courts was a feature in the Bi of his hon, and learned friend the member for Plymouth which met with his approval, and he rejoiced to think that in the present Bill the same feature appeared, as it contained provisions for referring to local and cheap tribunals dispute3 on property of deceased persons which was of little value. Looking at this as a practical measure, vwhich would effectnally get rid of existing evils, and, by uniting various opinions as to the best maode of getting rid of them, insure its safe passnge through the House, he folbt not the slighest hesitation in doing that in office which he would have done out of office-namely, give the Bill his unqualified ssent. (Hear, bear.) In one sense this would be a new court, but it would be constracted of materials at the disposal of the Legislature, and thereby many difficult questions, including that of compensation, would be avoided. He did not doubt that the court would be fuly occupied, when, in addition to the common form business, it had to dispose of questions of marriage and divorce, and matters now disposed of in the Admiralty Court. The hon. and learned member for Plymouth, when hb spoke of the transfer to the courts of common law, must have contemplated the ultimate transfer of all that business; otherwise the Admiralty Court and a new court for marriage and divorce would be required;hutb he thought the Judges of the common law courts, notwitthstanding the commis>sion which was now sitting, would scarcely be prepared to take upon themselves that additional burden, and he doubted whether the machinery of those courts would enable them to deal with the whole business i a manner satisfactory to the public. Again congratulating tihe House at the prospect of getting rid at last of widespread grievances, he would conclude by expressing his hope soon to see this useful and practical measure passed into a law. (Hear, hear.) Mr. HEADLAM congratulated the Government upon haviDg at last introduced a BiU which stood a fair chance of bringing this long-pending question to a proper settlement. He anticipated the success of the Bill, because the framers of it had avoided the grounds of objection which were urged aginst former measures. He sympathized in the objections to London being made the central place where a11 wills would have been deposited, and to the decision on the validity of wins being thrown into the Court of Chancery; but this Bill was free from those objections. With respect to the proctors of York he thought that they stood in a different position from the proctors of London, and that the House would do well to consider their just claims. He rejoiced at the prospect of a decision of the question, and he hoped in comnittee they would unite in endeavouring to make the Bill as perfect as possible. (Hear.) M1r. CAIRNS was quite ready to join in the congratulations which had been expressed at the prospect of the measure meeting with the approbation of the House. He thought it was owing to the discretion of thoee who framed it in steering clear of the objections which had been fatal to former propositions. This was not the time to discuss minute details, but he wished to throw out some suggestions for the consideration of the right hon. gentlenian the Attorney-General. He quite agreed that, as they were going to establish a supreme court, to be called the Court of Probate, the judge of that court, with respect to salary and other provisions, should be placed in a position to give him weight and importance, and when they had assigned to him such a position the next care must be to give him something to do, He found that, with regard to the contentious business, in every case in which the beir at law desired to dispute a will the matter would be sent to be tried as an issue at common law. Be was quite aware that there was no satisfactory way of deciding claims td- real estate except by tho verdict of a, jury, but be wanted to know why that decision could not be obtained tmder the direction of the Judge of the Court of Probate? It had been the dicgrace of the legal system of this country that it had been in the habit of bandying suits from one court to another. A suit was instituted in one court, banded over to another to decide a question of fact or of law, and then brought back to the court in which it was instituted for ultimate decision. That was exactly what it was proposed to do with regard to cases in whic the beir at Law disputed the will. It might be right to appeal to a jury, but why could, not thae be done be=ore the Judge of the Court of Probate - why need it be handed over to the courts of common law ? If the judge of the Court of Probate were competent to sit at tbe head of that court, he was also competint to direct a jnry in the trial of a question of fact relating to a wilL Acccdn,however, to this Bill, the judge of the Court of Probatge, with all his special knowledge of the law applicable to wilis, with all his peculiar aptitude for investigating questions affecting the sanity or insanity of the testator, or the exercise of undue ufluence on the part of the person obtainmg the will, was not to direct the jury, but they were to be directed by a common law judge, whose experience was entirely confined to a diflerent branch cf the law. That was an aboas which he trusted would be corrected when themeasurewentintocommittee.Anotberprovision'that excited his surprise was that all appeals from the Court of 1 robate were not to lie to the tnbunal to which all such appeals had hitherto gone-viz., the Judicial Committee of lPrivy Council. but were to go to the Judicial Committee of Pi ivy Council at stage No. 1 and then to be referred by that court to the House of Lords at stare No. 2. Of all tbe' courtsof the country none was more popular that the Judicl Committee of Privy Council, and no part of the business of that court was more satisfactorily transacted than the appeals from the ecclesiastical courts respecting wiDs.- This provision appeared to have erept ino. the Bill in another place out of deferenoe to the 'rejudices of those who hxd charge of the rnesure. ln tbe last Paaliamentthey hada discussionon the apellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords, with the resU1t ot whieh they were all familar, and notbing that had since occuned had furnished a substantial remedy for the complaints made against that tribunal. Was there, then, anv valid ground for taking away this appellate business from a coust which had heretofore discharged it to the satisfactioA of the suitors, and transferring it 4to a tribunal which had rever yet possssed it, and which was not. to say t'he leout mn tbe very best odour with the public? No doubt it wou.l be wise to allow contentious cases of trifling amount to b; decided inx the County Ocurts, butt singu3 to b

It was but the other day we recorded the centenary anniversary of the Battle of Plassy, from which we date the commencement of British power in India. About a month before that full period of one hundred years had elapsed, although on this side of the globe we knew it not, the son of the late Mogul Emperor had been proclaimed King at Delhi by certain regiments of the Bengal Army, which had broken out into open mutiny. This mutiny has assumed a very serious character. We do not write for the purpose of inspiring alarm or suggesting timid counsels. The moment has arrived for action-shalp, stern, and decisive. An Imperial interest is at stake-nothing less than our dominion in British India. It would be easy enough to point out the errors of omission and. commission which have been mainly instrumental in bringing about the present crisis. The course of policy to be adopted for the future is also matter for swift, though serious discussion, but just now it would be idle to waste time either upon recrimination or upon questions of general policy. In the first place the mutiny must be Fsuppressed, and in such a manner as shall impress the minds of the natives with the nature of the power they have defied when it~s real strength is put forth. If it be true that we are still very much in the dark as to the true feelings and opinions of the natives of India, it is no less true that they know far less of us than we do of them. The disadvantages arising from ignorance may tell upon both sides, but they teU more in our favour than to our prejudice. The crisis is a most serious one. We do not wish to conceal its true nature from the country, but it is not so serious that it should inspire one moment of hesitation. The vigour displayed by the victors of Plassy and Assaye should be the model for our imitation at the present moment-if, indeed, a powerful and resolute people ever need any inspiration from the past. But first let us speak of the facts, as far as they are yet known to us. The mutinous spirit, which had to a certain extent been checkedl, if not extinguished, in the more southern portion of Bengal, had spread to BMeerut. At this post two Regiments of Native Infantry-the 11th and 20th-had united with the 3d Light Cavalry, and had broken out into open revolt. This revolt, as far as it sbowed itself at Meerut, had been put down. There had been a collision between the revolted and the European troops, the result of which was that the mutineers were dispersed and fled. To the southward, and at no great distance, lies the important city of Delhi, the capital of the old Mogul Empire; and this town appears to have been the centre of the revolt. Wben the fugaitives from Meerut arrived here they were instantly joined by three other Regiments of Native Infantry-the 38th, the 54th, and 74th; and the united forces instantly took possession of the town. Any one who has had experience of the tiger-like ferocity of the Indian in a moment of what appears to him success will be prepared for the result. An indiscriminate massacre of the Europeans was the first act on which the mutineers decided, and this they are said to have carried out in a manner the most remorseless and the most complete. No tenderness was shown to sex, no reverence to age; Delhi was turned into shambles; and so the first act of the tragedy was played out. It might have been expected. The next step, however, may be considered as of a more ominous kind, if it is evidence of any preconceiveddesign. The son of the late Mogul Emperor was proclaimed King, and thus the shadow Sovereign whom we have so long maintained in empty state has been raised into momentary importance-briefly, we trust, to disappear for ever from human account. Nor is this all; tit re has been disquiet on our old Sikh battle-ground. We are informed, under date from Calcutta of the 18th of May, that at Ferozepore also there had been disturbances, but that tlhese disturbances had been suppressed. So far for the blacker side of the picture; and next for what has been done to mitigate or meet the evil. " The Government was taking " active measures to suppress the revolt, and " was concentrating troops araund Delhi." The italics are our own, and may, we trust, be justified by the event. It is of the last importance that the rebellion should be extinguished where it has arisen, and that armed fugitives should not be allowved to escape in numbers from the principal seat of the disturbances. When to this intelligence we add that the Rajah of GwALiot -the Mahratta State abutting on the south. wvestern limit of Delhi-had placed the troops of which he could dispose at the service of the British Government we have exhausted the brief, but momentous, advices which the electric telegraph brought to us at a late hour last night. The open revolt in the Bengal Presidency of five Regiments of 2Native Infantry and of one Regiment of Light Cavalry, independently of what may have taken place at Ferozepore, is undoubtedly intelligence as important as any which we have published since the fall of Sebastopol. It must also be remembered that these are not the only regiments affected with the taint of mutiny; indeed, the very telegraph which brings this news adds. that the 34th Regiment of Native Infantry, which had been before suspected, had been disbanded at Barrackpore. So far from feeling any serious apprehension for the stability of British power in India in consequence of these occurrences, we should be inclined to foretell that they may tend to confirm it, and to give us a fresh lease of empire. We have for a long time been pursuing half-measures in India. There can be no doubt that the reignof themockKing at Delbi will be but a brief one, and that a terrible retribution will be inflicted on the mutineers, not merely in that character, but as the bloody and pitiless murderers of the Europeans in Delhi. If it was to come, this revoltecould not have occurred at a better time. When the Russian war was raging it might have proved a more considerable inconvenience ; indeed, a less matter, such as the hostilities with Persia, now happily terminated, might have been a serious obstacle in the way of a satisfactory settlement. What we require is the presence in British India of the most competent officer who can be found, and an entire revision of our Indian military system. It is not here the time or place to enter npon wider questions of policy, such as the system of double government, which has gone for so much in producing the present state of afairs. We cannot, however, conclude without urging again upon our rulers, as soon as this revolt is suppressed, the absolute necessity of carxying on the Indian railway system with greater vigour. The time has arrived when the power of transporting compact and highly trained bodies of European troops from one point of India to another may be all-important. In India we are constrsting railoads on the expensive English qj a finie lines through the jungle and the wilderness, after the cheap American model, could be laid down in a tenth of the time and at less than a tenth of the expense, and these would enable us to hold posseasion of the country with an army comparatively mall in numerical force.
The saying that the English are not a military people can only be true in the sense that besides being military they are a great deal more. Besides the broad fact that, including Army, Navy, and troops in the Company's service, we send out nearly as many warriors, for our population, as any other nation, and aU these for service abroad, every successive opportunity brings out the deep military feeling of the country. One had only to go into Hyde Park yesterday morning, or even within a mile of it, to see what the English wil do and suffer for the sake of a military show. Streams of men, women, and vehicles of all sorts were steadily setting in for the various entrances; and in a sultry midsummer day, when almost everybody had been up, for business or for pleasure, till long after midnight, at 8, or even earlier, they had breakfasted and put on their beat Park dresses. To be sure, the accommodation was scant; there were few houses in -which complaint was not made of a certain short and rather illwrittemi reply to applications. But everybody went who could; everybody suffered considerable discomfort in doing so; and everybody was nevertheless much delighted with the smalest share in the day's work. What they saw-that is, what the bulk of them saw-was not much. They saw troops with whose appearance they are perfectly familiar performing some of the simplest possible evolutions, marching round an oblong enclosure, first slow, then fast. They saw the QuN, with a handsome cavalcade, pass to and fro on her arrival and departure. The favoured occupants of the smaU central gallery saw before them an irregular rank, in all sorts of uniforms, come up one by one and receive from Queen VICroRIA the choicest and chariest, though we cannot say the handsomest, honour of the war. There was little, indeed, that might not have been imagined, and none but very provincial spectators, or those who are incurably stupid about military affairs, saw any novelty. But all were satisfied, and when at 12 o'clock they returned home, wearied and burnt up, they did not the least regret what they had gone through. There is such a determination in some quarters to stint the British appetite for military shows that we must be thankful for what we can get, and note down any improvement. This, however, was an improvement, for it was a beautiful scene. The situation is at least a picturesque one, the masses of trees, the water, and the handsome houses about the Park, all entering into the view. No doubt, too, our cuirasses and helmets, our black horses and white sheepskins, the gorgeous and glittering Guards, the more sombre and grave Artillery, the neat and businesslike Marines, the picturesque but rather theatrical Highlanders, and the handfuU of Blue-jackets, all made a greater variety than one sees in a large army abroad. They went through their few movements rapidly and exactly, and there appeared to be no hesitation, no faltering, or mishap of any kind. The wicked crowyd are always on the look out for fallen horses and empty saddles, but they were not rewarded. The day was brilliant, though a trifle closer and more sultry than it usually is even at this time of the year. The ladies mustered strongly, and the only pity was that, as they stood in one long line, and neither moved themselves nor had anybody moving immediately before them, they were not seen; and the thousands of new bonnets mounted for the occasion were, severally lavished on a very small circle of spectators. There was at least on all sides, both as regards the soldiers and people, the idea of a grand spectacle. The number of soldiers-great for Hyde Park-the aptitude of the space, and the presence of the Royal Family, the QuEEN on horseback, and the Princes in picturesque and quaint Highland costume, with here and there a few other circumstances of interest, were sufficient to make up an effective whole, and to provide material for amusement. Bat room for improvement there undoubtedly is. There were features of the arrangement so gratuitously and almost maliciously stupid, that we must suppose some Eorse Guards theory of human nature and official duty to account for them. Why were there not seats ? Why was not the platform in steps, instead of an inclined plane? What would have been the cost of an awning? Many ladies, with every desire to see the show, were obliged to give it up at once when they heard there were no seats; others went, and came away very shortly; others stood to the end and were much exhausted. Then the gallery, if such it might be called, was one long line, and allowed the occupants very little range of view, except just before them. There were two sights-the presentation of the medals, and the movement of the troops. The former of these was on one particular spot, the latter was over the whole field. The provision made for the spectators, however, answered neither purpose; it did not allow a good general view of ihe field, much less a concentration of the general gaze to the ceremony going on a few paces before the Royal gallery. Had the presentation taken place in any grand street in London-in Piccadilly or Oxford-street-it would certainly have been seen well by very many more people than saw it yesterday. The least curvature in the line of the galleries would have made a great difference in this respect, by giving a little convergence to the lines of sight. This may not be thought a very important affair; but it is important that the public sympathy should be secured for the defenders of our country, and that the sentiment of heroism should be cherished by giving heroes their own, proper, ancient guerdon of praise. Inldeed, this is recognized by yesterday's proceedings. But, if the thing should be done at all, it ought to be well done. In such mere mechanical arrangements success in surely the test of ability. There is reason enough in these days fo- wishing to see more power of arrangement, and, what comes to the same thing, more habit of consideration. We have forgotten the Medal itself, or the Cross rather, for such it is. Would we could forget it! Never did we see such a dull, heavy, tasteless affair. Much do we suspect that if it was on sale in any town in England at a penny a-piece, hardly a dozen would be sold in a twelvemonth. There is a cross, and a lion, and a scroll or two worked up into the niost shapeless mass that the size adnmits of. Valour must, and doubtless will, be still its own reward in this country, for the Victoria Cross is the sh3a)biest of all prizes.
There are certain subjects the interest in which must be kept up by talking. This vast quantity of tallk is necessary in order to buoy them up and keep them above water. Perpetual talk is the cork or bladder which makes the body swim. We presume this is a necessity, so we must not grumble. It is not, however, an entirely pleasant necessity, because, unfortunately4 people will get tired of a subject, and repetition will produce flatness. This is the kind of Scylla and Charybdis between which a popular question, such as that of Education, unceasingly oscillates; the inte,ast in it must be kept up by talking, 'while .i intaxo in it also lessens by ialkrb.g. There is a constant process of absorption and regurgitation after a certain quantity of repetition. When we are thoroughly tired out attention sleeps and the subject sinks; then, after due repose, attention wakes again, and the subject rises again to the surface. This is the law of alternation under which all subjects that have to be talked about fall. It is rather extraordinary, at fir3t sight, that the most interesting and important subjects' are just tjhe subjects of which pou hear everybody declaring himself perfectly sick. You are inclined to wonder at the perverseness or fastidiousness or foppishness' of human nature, til you remember the fatal law of the case, that interest creates talk, and that talk in its turn lessens interest. The law of action and reaction is as certain here as it is in mechanics. The subject of National Education is just at this moment receiving a perfect flood of light, which the discussions in Willis's Rooms and a debate in Parliament have been simultaneouslypouring upon it. Every fresh discussion, however, of this subject only seems to show more clearly that the great impediments to the education of the poorer classes in this country are not such as legislation can remove. It is assumed as a first principle in all these discusqions that. you- are' not to interfere with domestic liberty and the right of the parent to send his children to school or not, as he likes, and keep them there for as long or as short a time as he likes, and, that being the case, it is quite evident that we are thrown back upon the natural demand for education among the poorer classes themselves for all the success and progress of the movement. It is a simple case of supply and duemand. You can only get your article bought at' the value which the purchaser himself places upon it. But how are we to inoculate the poorer classes with a value for the article ? Sir JomN PANlGTON says by bettering the article. He lays the fault upon the schools and their low standard of instruction, but even his own statistics fail him here. He finds that in 10 per cent. of our schools the instruction in arithmetic is reported as imperfect and bad. But the evil which lies at the root of the whole deficiency of our National Education-the premature removal of the children from school by their parents-is not commensurate with this, or with a much higher rate of bad instruction. This early removal from school goes on everywhere; whether schools are good, bad, or indifferent, it is the same. The question, then, has still to be answered,-how are you to create such an estimate of the value of education in the minds of the poor that they wil give up the present advantages of their children's earnings in consideration of the future benefit of an additional year or two at school? ,The only means you have for impressing this idea upon the poorer classes is that common one which you use for every process of which persuasion is the end-viz., argument. You can talk with them, set the subject before them, and show them what an advantage they are depriving their children of. Conferences in Willis's Rooms may discuss, and Parliaments may debate, and there may be a vast quantity of ingenious suggestion and construction of paper apparatus and machinery for the spread I of education and the inoculation of the poorer classes; but when you fairly examine the means at your disppsal and have reduced them to their substance you find your whole artillery contained in one very simple weapon-talk. It is Parson Joxxs or his wife or daughter, or the Squire's wife or daughter, or somebody else or his wife or daughter, trying to persuade Mother HIJB1DAt to let BILL go another year to schooL That simple and primitive te4t-tite in a cottage, with washing going on perhaps, buckets spilling water, and pots and pans sounding on all sides of you, is the ultimate engine to which the whole power of the whole of society on this subject is reduced. Conferences and debates in Parliament, public speeches, and grand schemes all fly over the heads of the poor; they do not recognize public opinion in this form; they do not hear of these proceedings, in the first place, and if they did they would not care one straw about them; they are deficient in that primary idea of cause and effect which would be necessary for their perceiving the least connexion between a meetirg in Willis's Rooms and any one thing they had to do. The only sbape in which Mother HUBBARD ever sees or deals with public opinion on the subject of National Education is somebody talkming to her in her cottage about Brar. Now, this being the case, we cannot give any large hopes of the result of these cottage tMtess-atites. The truth is, the life of the poor is a struggle; they know education is a good thing, but they want the boy's wages, and they trust to the chapter of accidents completing' the commencement of what has begun at school. But we will venture on a hint to the cottage arguer. We never read, we must confess, any public discussion on the subject of National Education without wishing that persons more accurately defined to themselves the goal and object of education in the case of the poor. Thus Mr. CowPEB "had heard schoolmasters say that nothing was "more distressing than to see the same boy who had "left them at the age of 11 an intelligent active "lad, with all his wits about him, returning to "thera at 1.7, after he had been at the plough, a "heavy, dull, stupid, loutish sort of fellow, who, so far from being able to describe all those "beautiful floulishes with the pen at which he "used to be an adept when at school, hardly "knew how to -write his own name." Now, this may be very lamentable; at the sarme time, if a boy leaves school able to read and write, that must be considered, ordinarily speaking, an adequate education for a poor boy. We want limitation in our ideas here. The schoolmaster must not expect,'even in the very best state of things, to keep the boys of the poor at school till they have acquired the full power of using their education and acquired intellectual tastes. This is wholly out of the question. A poor boy's education is reading and writing. When he is once able to read he has got the key to further knowledge, and it must be left to himself to use that key or not. If he is intelligent he will use it; this key will introduce him to books, those books will amuse, informn, and elevate his mind, and so he will unconsciously be educating himself long after he has left school. Give him this key, and you enable him- to be his own educator. But it is idle to expect that the' demands of active life will let you ordinarily give him more than this. You cannot really give the poor an education. No; but you can give them the key to an education-a key contained in the power of reading. Having given them this, the better minds among them wMill use this power; the idler will neglect it; but you cannot ordinarily do more than give them this key, and we must limit our ideas, of what constitutes a poor boy's education accordingly. And in arguing with the poor about education this limitation will not be inopportune. The remotcr stages of education the poor do not appreciate, they lie too much beyond them, but they do appreciate the power of reading. That strikes home to them. They see with their own eyes that it is a power enabling one man to do what another cannot do, and they have the idea about it that a traveller has who hears his companions using the language of the country, and feels himself cut off rom a whole world around him because he bls not the same power. The poor are quite up io the great convenience of being able to read, tkzj~ tQApass away the time in long even- ings or in illnesses. 'The power- of reading has foi far made itr, way and established its ground that they feel a certain incompleteness without it, and think an apology necesary for the 4efect. This is the quarter, then, in which they shoulcl be attacked when the cottage arguer - protests against early removal from schooL

There is no news from Grenada relative to the pending dispute with the United States. Mr. Bowlin had intimated that, being satisfied that no proposition would be made to him, he should leave Bogota on the 20th inst for the United States. The British Macintosh claim bad been settled. New Grenada pays $560,000 in paper instead of cash. Diplomiatic intercourse between the two countries has been resumed.

MON Y-MARKETaad CITYINTELLIGEMNC. Friday Evening. The funds remain without animation, and at the close of the day there was a slight decline. Consols for the 9th of Ju1y opened at 93i to i ex. dividend, and after regular hours transations took place at 93 to s. Bad accounts from the Parin J,ourse, coupled with vague rumours of the receipt of telegraphic despatches from India and China, announcing a further unfavourable movement in tbe excchanges, were the causes of the distrust late in the day. Bank Stoek left off at 212kto 21U; lReduced, 92k to 93; New Thraeeper Cents., 92k to 93S; Exehequer Bonds, 98ff to i; and India Bonds, Xs. to 4s. discount. There are too many Exche- iiier-bills in the market, and an increase in the demand for money to-day caused them to drop to 8s. to 4s. discount. Foreign stocks exhibited little activity, and there was less firmness in some descriptions. Turkish Six per Cents. for the account were negotiated at 961, J, and i; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 102k and 102; Portuguese Three per Cents. were dealt in at 46k, i, and 47; Russian Five per Cents., 110; Spanish Three per Cents., for money, 42i; for the account, 42; Spanish Certificates, 61 per cent.F; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 98k. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the ratea were a shade lower than last post. The corn-market was dull this morning at the rates of Monday. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a steady business at firm prices. The depression on the Paris Bourse is unmitigated, and a further fall of a quarter per cent. has taken place, the final quotations of the French Three per Cents. this evening being 68f. 10c. for money, and 68f. 20c. for the end of the month. The suspension was announced to-day of the respectable and old-established bank of Messrs. Smith, Hilder, Smith, and Serivens, at Hastings. It was a bank of issue, with a circulation limited under the Act of 1844 to 38,0381., but the amount of notes at present outstanding is stated not to be more than about 25,0001. The total liabilities of the firm, including the circulation, are estlinated at 150,0001. They enjoyed excellent credit, and the disaster is attributed to involvements of the senlior partner with the recent failure of his brother, Mr. Richard Smith, an extensive farmer and hop-grower. Upon the nature of these liabilities becoming known a stoppage was immediately resolved upon, although there were still funds in the hands of the London agents, and also some of the London discount houses. Under the circumstances it is therefore hoped that a good dividend may have been saved for the general creditors. The bank had branches at St. Leonard's, Battle, Hawkhurst, Robertsbridge, and Hailsham. The Board of Trade returns for the past month have been issued to-day, and present the extraordinary increase of 2,648,9041. in the declared value of our exportations as compared with the corresponding month of 1856. The principal augmentation is in the shipment of cotton goods, but these, judging from recent accounts from Manchester, cannot have left much profit. The next largest improvement is in wooUens, and after these machinery and iron and copper manufactures show the greatest activity. Among our staple manufactures none are on the unfavourable side. The subjoined table exhibits the exact increase or decrease under each head:- DzcLAR5D VALuE or RxroniToNs. The total increase ini our exports for the first five months of the year has been 6,888,2121., or niore than 13 per cent., and it has occurred in the following order:- January, increase . .. ... £1,083,319 February - .. . ... 1,587,293 March - ... ... ... ... 1,007,778 April . ... ... ... ... 560,918 May . ... ... ... ... 2,648,904 C(ompared with the corresponding five months of 1855, the increase is 15,251,8141., or nearly 41 per cent. With regard to imported commodities the arrivals generally show a rather large diminution, while there has been no corresponding decrease in consumption. Subjoined are the quantities of provisions, &c., imported and taken for home conAsumntinn *_ In the miscellaneous imports, which were very large in the preceding month, there has been a dim,nution that will help to account for the temporary cessation of the drain of gold. If this, however, instead of being a consequence of economy on the part of the population, has merely been attained by drawinig uipon existing stocks, it will have to be made up at a future time. At a meeting of the London Chartered Bank of Australia, held to-day, Mr. Duncan Dunbar presiding, the report and accounts (an abstractof which appeared in The Times of the 16th inst.) were adopted. The gross profits for the past year have amounted to 82,0001., and the London and colonial expenses have been 31,0001. Besides the bank in London there are two establishments at Sydney and four branches. Little reduction in the outlay can be romised, owing to the scale of salaries. The bad debts having been liquidated, the directors consider the bank to have been restored to a satisfactory position, and the profits are expected gradually to increase. It was stated, in answer to questions, Ohat the directors are under no advances, and that 'he whole of the secu-ities have been thoroughly examined. At the close of the proceedings a divi- dend of 24 per cent. for the half-year ending the 31st of December last was agreed to. The colonial produce-markets during the week have assuned a more animated appearance, and the ibusiness transacted has been occasionally at an advance, although heavy supplies were in some instances offered. In sugar, however, a partial decline of 6d. to ls. has been submitted to where importers pressed sales, excepting for the finest desoriptions, which have been readily taken at extreme rates. The Dit(,- Trading Company's next sale iB fixed for the 23d v dMy, and will contain 80,800 baskets 2,745 mats Java, and 7,377 bags Mauritius. Numerous parcels of plantation Ceylon coffee have been sold at ls. to 2s. advance upon coloury kinds, and five floating cargoes of Brazil, taken for near ports, realized full rates. A cargo of Guayaquil is reported sold at the high quotation of 105f., being again a rise of 5f. Rice is steady, with a moderate inquiry for the better descriptions of white Bengal. Nothing of interest has transpired in spice. An improved inquiry prevailed for saltpetre at one period, but to-day there were sellers at a slight reductiou. Higher rates have been paid for severalkinds of tea, and the marketis very buoyant. Holders are now asking a further advance for good to fine congou. Good common has also been in increased demand. The return from the Bank of England for tho week ending the 20th of June gives the following results when comparedl with the previous week :_ Public deposit ..£. ... £7,799,602 ...

STATB OF TADEZ. MANCHESTER, JuNE 26. The improvement noticed on Tuesday, arising from the reduotion of stocks and other causes, continues, and there Is a steady demand for cloths of most descriptions at very full rates. Theadvauceincotton tbis week has been quite equal to that of the last and precedingweek's,beingabout the 16th of a penny on fair Uplands, and Ad. per lb. on Mobile and Orleans. With this advance manufacturers are not, of course, equal to keep pace, and all that can be said in that respect is that they are in a position to enforce rather better rates in some cases. Messrs. George Fraser, Son, and Co., in their circular of yesterday, report the advanced quotations during the last four weeks as follows:-" For t-s printerm lAd. per piece; for 9-8ths madapollams, ld. to Ad. - for 9.8th printers and shirtings, Id. to 3d. per piece; for Agured shirtings, 1ld.; for low 5 to 8-inch jaco. nots, Id. ; for T cloths and long cloths, 1d. ; and for 39inch 64 reed shirtings a further 3d. per piece, the lower qualities of the latter up to 71b. remaining stationary in value. Yarns generally are Ad. to id. per lb. dearer, while some of the spinnings of Indian mule yarns have recovered full id. per lb. froin the extreme point of depression, and domestics have advanced a further 1-16d., or in some cases even id. per yard upon the prices at which business was practicable a month ago. The finer kinds of Indian jaconots and mulls are, on the contrary, a little lower in price than this time last month. Where these quotations, however, are held firmly they tend somewhat to impede busi. ness."
ELECTION Co vM[TTAER. MAVO (coTMwvI- The committee rea,embi,d at 11 ocloclc, Mr. BEhoefit d in the chair. Mr. O'Mialley, Mfr. B. James, and Mr. Hale anpeared :n support of the petition* -Mr M. Smitb, Mr. arlsake, and Mr. Bachanan, of the irish bar, for the sitting member,. MIr. SCHOLEFIE1D, be4ore the commencement of the proceedings of the day, called attention to an objection which he was reported to have made on behalf of the csm. mittee to the title given by Mr. B. James on the previous day to Archbishop 'Htale. He did not object, on behalf of the committee, to the title of Archbishop being given to Dr. M'Hale, but he did object to the title of Archbishop of Taam being given to him, as that was a territorial title, to which he had no right. The learned counsel on either side said they had so under. stood the expression of the opinion of the committee. Mr. Prendergast was then called and examined by Mr. O'MALTLX. He said,-I live in the county of Mayo. lam a retired solicitor and a Toter for the county. I know Mr. Isadore Barke, of Cnrralee, and Mr. D. Rutley. On the 5th of April 1 was at Claremorris. I accompameed young Mr. Bnrke to Ballinrobo on that day in order to be ready to vote at the election. Mr. Rutley was taking somo voters to Ballinrobe with a military escort. On our arrival at Balin. robe we turned up a lane in order to avoid the mob. Au additional party of military and constabulary had been sent from the town to meet nu. There is a wall on either side of the lane. The voters were attacked ia that lane by some i people who commanded the lane from the wall. There was an enormous mob round about the lane beaded by Father Conwav. They seemed to be acting under his direction. He was either on or inside the walU I heaTd him speak repeatedly to the mob. I understandIdsh very well. I heard him say to the voters in Irish, "I May the curse of God and the curse of the flock be upon any men who vote for Higgins." [The witness repeated the s6ntenoe in Irish to Mr. Buchanan, one of the learned counsel, who under. stood the language, and considerable amusement was excited by the endeavours of the official shorthand-writer to take a note of the words.] I am a Roman Catholi¢, and well acquainted with the babits and feelings of the peasantry. This expression was repeated by Conway several times in an excited and violent, but solemn manner. It was uttered in the way of denunciation. It decidedly had a great effect upon the people, and was, no doubt, calculated to excite a Roman Catholic mob. I remained at Ballinrobe from the Sunday until Tuesday morning. The town was in a state of great commotion, and infuriated mobs were continually going about. The mobs were no doubt on Moore's side. The voters of Colonel EHiggins could not go about the town in safety without an escort. I was confined to my hotel with several otber supporters of Colonel His I w Conway on horsebackriding about the town. gFdo not like to go the length of saying that he was the leader of the mobs in the town, but he appeared to have the control over them. There were otherRoman Catholic priests inthe town. Ballinrobe is Conway's parish. I was at one of the polling. booths. Therewere two poling places. By Colonel NORTEH.-?was escorted to the polling-booth. I could not have gone without an escort. By Sir J. HiAzsxa-I do not think that voters were usuaUy escorted to the polling booths at former elections for Mfayo. Cross-examined by Mr. BUCHAsA.-Voters have at former elections been brought into the town under protection. Probably a military force and a strong body of police have been present -t every election, but I don't remember. Both ends of the !ane were stopped up by the military. There were seven or eight people on the wall, but a great manywere round abaut the outside of the lane. There was a great deal of noise in the street, No one was in the lane but the voters and the escort. I heard what Conway said. I did not hear him say anything about going to mass. I heard him say nothing else, for he got very quickly off the wall. The stones were coming very rapidly from the wall, and Mr. Burke's son presented a pistol to it and said if tho voUeys of stones were continued he would fire, and the stones then ceased. I don't know whether he presented the pistol at Conway, but Conway took tho hint and disappeared; and I think he was quite right. (A laugh.) [Tis witness being rather deaf, the learned counsel was obilged to repeat several of his questions, and observed that he hoped the witness had heard Conway more distinctly than he now heard him. The witness replied that Mr. Conway did not speak in a playhouse whisper-he intended to be heard.] (A laugh.) The third candidate was Captain Padmer. I did not hear any excitement about him. The voters were without protection when they were within the booth, where there was no excitement, but I believe they were protected up to the bootb. The voters who had been attacked plumped for Colonel Higgins. I believe that Conway is the curate of Ballinrobe. The deputy-sheriff was a supporter of Colonel Hliggins. I was only in the BaUinrobe booth. Tonday is market-day at Ballinrobe. Re-examined.-There is no market at Ballinrobe on a Tuesday. We took the voters into the hotel, where they remained until the polling was over, and very good care was taken of them. By Mr. BUCHANAN.-The people going to mass at Conway's chapel would have to pass by the hotel where the voters were kept. By the CosssTTEr.-There is a resemblance between the Trish words for " church" and " chapel," but I don't think that people who understand the langnage would confound the one with the other. Mr. Joseph Burke, examined Mr. O'MAL.uY.-I am the son of hr. Burke, of Curralee. Several of my father's tenantr! are voters of Mayo county. My father supported Colonel Higgins. On the Saturday before the election I aesisted to collect the voters, and I accompanied them on the Sunday morning. Mr. Rutley and another magistr te (fr. Farrell) wera m command of the escort. We had applied for an escort, as we could not have brought the voters without it. Some of the voters had said they were afraid to go without protection. On the 25th of March I was atClaremorrls, where the Rev. Peter Reynolds is the parish priest. Reynolds officiated at the chapel. Re addressed the people with reference to the election. Ho told themnto assemble on the following Sunday to consult about the election. He advised them in very strong terms to vote for Moore and Palmer, andnot for ColonelHiggins. On the 29th I was at the chapel at Nace, about two miles from Claremorris. Mr. O'Domnell is the curate there. He addressed the congregation after mass. He said four bishops had signed a poll pro. clamation against one of the candidates; that he must bo a very bad man, or they would not hare done so; and that there was a verystrongfeelingagainstColonelEiggins'ssupporters He hoped if they went to BaUinrobe that they would get back safe. I accompanied the voters out of Claremorms. The mob chased us, and the police had to fix their bayonets to get through the mob. I was struck witk a stone. I was with my father's men and went on before tho other voters. [The witness here repeated the evidence already given by Mr. Rutley and Mr. Prendergast with respect to the attacks on the voters between Claremorris and Balinrobe.]. When we were in the lane and voleys of stones were being thrown at us, I saw Conway on the waU putting his hand to a stone. I then took out my pistol and said, " By G-, the first man that throws a stone I will blow his brains out !" The effect was that Conway, who was on the wall, disappeared. Some of the men got into the lane, notwithstanding the efforts of the infantry to keep them out. We did not lose any of our men. The mob attempted to pull the soldiers and the voters off their horses. One of them tried to get me off [my horse, but a dragoon threatened him with his sword, and made him desist. Conway mounted a horse, and complained to a stipendiary of my having arms. That gentleman asked for them, and I gave them up, saying I had done with them. I remained in Monaghan's Hotel until the voters had been polled. We could not go out of Monagban's Hotel without an escort. I was hooted and groaned at whenever I appeared at tho hotel doors. I saw Conway shake his hand in a voter's face at the booth. I said that was not fair treatment. I saw Mr. Reynolds going among the voters at the Claremorris booth. I saw Mr. Conway and another priest at the Kilmaine booth. Cross-examined by MIr. BucEcA.Ne.-I did not take an active part in canvassing for Colonel Higgins. I asked one man to vote, and he did not. A provisional committee was formed, andI belonged to it. Two magistrates besides Mr. Bentley went with me to Claremorris. Both of them were on Colonel Higgins's committee. Mr. Walter Burke brought some voters into the booth covered with mud. Some ofEmy men, I think, shouted for Higgins. Conway put his hand to the stone, but did not take it up. He was kneeling as the time. He said something about not hurting the miEtary or the police. Re-examined.-There were upwards of 100 names on the provisional committee, which was got up to express confidence in Colonel Higgins. Dean Burke and Phew were the only priests in the county who supported Colonel Higgins, and Phew was pelted. Mr. James French, examined by Mr. O'MALLEv. -lam a landed proprietor of Mayo, and a Roman Catholic. Iwent to Ballinrobe in order to vote for Colonel Higgins, and was at mass on the Sunday before the election at Conway's chape. Before the conclusion of mass I heard Conway speak to the people on the subject of the election, and I put down what he said in writing. I have the memorandum that I made with me. I wrote part of it immediately after mrss and part of it at the election. I communicated what I had heard to Mr. Griffin. The memorandum is as follows "hfts, euloglzing Mssrs. Mloose and Palmer to a high degree Conwasy said, ' but as to Iges, he s the most coaunmateo 3O drel t-Dat ever Usv' Heibas deosved you fn eresr po!nt; every sro- Ise that he made to you at the last election ha h asbroken. He bam sold his country, hi3 tbody. aud hi soul, and yet he has now the pre everyu mnwho gives it to him.'" This took place immediately after the communion was celebrated, and before the mass was concluded. Conway used great violence of gesture and of action while uttering these expressions. During Saturday and the early part of Sunday the town was quiet. On the Sunday afternoon I saw Conway speaking to the mob from a window, and the town then became very excited. The conduct of the mob was very violent. One gentleman went onut of the hotel door, but in two minutes returned with a cut on his head. Many voters would not come into the town, they were 80 terrified by the mob. I tried to get them into the town, saying I did not care a fig for whom they voted, but I hoped they would come in and vote to show that they were men. Mir. Ratley came over to dine at our hotel, and, although we had 15 or 16 police at the door, wte w ere afraid to let him venture out again, and I was obliged to give him half mky bed. I sawv Conway haranguing the people from a Cross-examined by Mr. KARSLAXE.-Monaghan's Hotel was the head-quarters of Colonel Hliggins's voters. I have heard priests address the people on various subjects after mas, hut it is not a general custom. Conway spoke to the people before the conclusion of mass. I got into the town unmolested. I saw my tenants at the Court-house on Monday. They all went back to Monaghan's Hotel, and I ordered refreshment for tbem. *When the poll was closed on the Monday I went to the hotel and dined. On the Tuesday I was at the pall until it was adjourned, when I went away. It was adjourned in consequence of affidavits. I heard no remonstrance made against the adjournment. I vwas surprised that it was not adjourned long before. The deputy.heriff (a very nice youngman indeed), (a laugh), called Conway to order several times. The poll was closed in consequence of Conway's conduct. I dined with a gentlel,an opposite the hotel, and then sat up at the hotel til 3 'clock on Wednesday morning, when the town was quiet I then got my voters out. Mhey had plumped for Colonei Higgi2s Until they went they were eating nd drinking A XQy expene at the hotel, I Was not presant at the komiz*- tion. j I Iie4xamined.-The Rev. M[r.

The first active part I saw them take was the bringing in of the votemrThey were drawn up in front of thTe Court-house to furnish ana escor faor olonel Higgins's voters whenever they were required. They occasionally patrolled the town. On the dot casion when bayonets were fixed they remainea fixed for about 10 mizustes, when Sub-Inspector Maguire camoeup and ordered them to be unfixed. hr. Kelly, arehident of Balinrobe, but not -voter, proved that he had printed the placard signed by Conway, by the order of Coa nway. on cross-examination he admitted that he bad printed another placard issued by the other aide, by the order of ir. Griffin, the agent of Colonel Higgins. Mr. John Burke, examined by Mr. B. J.&mES.- I reaidle with my father at Oare, in Galway. On the 5th of April I accompanied f r m ,y father,shoA zanote for the counity 'of ay tor BaBinrobe. He was going to vote for Colonel piggins There was a man-servant driving us.vl We were In a car. About half ungst 5 or 6in the evening we arrived close to B mnhobe.o wear the town we Iet about 200 or 300 people in a very excited state. Mny of them were abou~t half drunk. Conway was on horseback in the mob. My father is a healbty man, notwithstanding his great age, but of a very nervous temperament. The mlob called mout "Stop o and we were obliged to stop. Conway siud, aftermooldng at us for a short time, "Oh, you are Colonel Higgins's supporters,-I wash my hands of You."H meanlit thepmob to oear him. Ie rode away about 100 yards,;and two men then rushed forwards, pulled me off the onrg,htnd dragged me about 100 yards by my coat-collar in thoe direction taken by Conway. He could see what was being done. Some of the men had gone across a field to loo'k for another person, and I heard a man tell Conway that this person was not at home. I said, "It is a shame to ee a man of my father's rank treated in this way, and forfyou not to interfere" He said, eIt iswnoin my power to prevent it." I said, "You kinow wel that it is insyor power, and you ought to prevent it," He the rode back to wher m father was and as soon as I could get looso from the meni who were holding me'l also went back touny father. My father was standing on the ground in the hands of the mob, evidently ix a state of great terror and excitement. He told me .he had been beaten on the back of the neck and on the chest. He was acrippleinathe arms, head, and back for some days afterwards. Conway thon took my father out of the hands of the mob, and replaced him on the car. I have no doubt that Conway had power to control the mob. I saidto Conway that he ought now to let my father and me go home. He said, heI wih take care of you." The car was then turne towards home. It had been turned round hby theinob. I said, "Tdhat will not answer, because 1 want to place my father in the care of his wife and daughters." My father asked what they wanted with him, and the ob said, "RNot to vote for Colonel Higgins." Conway said, "It wouldl have been folly for you to go into the town, evean with a escort, because Isadore Burke was taking in some voters a short time ago, and three or four men were kiled by the mob." He then produced a list of voters and lookHed for ourTames. Isaid mynameswas notmin it. My1ather said. membt me go home, and I wl not vote for Colonel Higgins." Conwaye sad, "Will you promise me, Ir. Burke, ont our honour, that you will not voto for Colonel Heiggimsatthe election th My father then promesed on his honour, not to vote if Conway would let him go 'with his life. Conway then said, mWell, let Mr. Burke go home, boys, as he has promised on his honour not to vote for Colonel Higgins." The Committee adjournewhile thi witness wasiunder examination until 11 o'clock this day. The committee-room was densely crowded during the whole of the day, and the space behind the Chairman was fireal with membes of the bouse of Commons. among whom were Mr.do yter, Mr. Fhorsman, and Mar. H. Herbert. PONTEFRACT. The comimittee met yesterday morning at 11 o'clock. The members are Mr. Headlam (chairman), Lord H. Lennox, Mr. F. Fortescue, Mr. R. B. Sheridan, Sir MrS. Stewart. Thero were two petitions, one from Mr. Oliveira, the late member, charging Mir. Wood, the sitting member, with bribery, treating, and undue influence, by himself or his agents the other from certain electors chargingMr. Oliveira with tile same practices. Mx. Edwin James, Air. Serjeat Pigott, and Mr. Diofty Seymour were counsel for Mr. Oliveira's petition, and Mr. Tr , o Mr. Pickering, and Mr. Webstr for the sitting romeMr atheelectors' petition. Mr. JpaMs opened the case. Pontefract, which was a very old borough, contained a very large leaven of freemen, and he believed he was correct in saying it was one of the most venal and corrupt constituencies in the k-ingdoui. Mr. Oliveira was electe, in 1852, sat for the borough unti the dissolution this year, and was a candidate witheMr. Monckton MiOles at the election in March. * e charges of corrupt practices were maade against M~r. Milnes. At the election a 1852 the candidates were Mr. Miles, who was returned as he deserved always to be, at the head of the poll, Mr. Lewis, a chancery barrister, who stood in the Conservative interest, and Mr. Oliveira. Mlr. Lewis was beaten by Mr. Oliveira by a majority of 25. Parliament met in the autumn of that year, and in November a petition was presented against Mr. Ollveira's return by Mfr. Lewis. Mr. Routledge, who -was then mayor of the borouigh, came to London for the purpose of settling the petition. The result was that-2,000?. was extracted from Mr. Oliveira for the withdrawal of the petition, and paid into the hands of Mtr. Routledge. Mr. Routledge premised thaLt if the 2,0001. were paid, AIX. Oliveira shiould be elected at the next election free of expense. Similar premises were made by Mr. Clough and by a Mr. Moo.These gentlemen, however, had since turned their backs on Mr. Oliveira, and he should be able to show mo6t clearly that they had acted as agents for Mr. Wood a%i the last election and that they had on his behalf canivassed the berough anci_carriedl on a moat extensive system of undue infuence. Tne consequence was that Mr. Oliveira was thrown out and Mr. 'Wood returned in his ulace. Early in the year 1S56 Mr. Wood, having an eye to the future representation of the borough, and, in fact, being then engaged in getting up a requisition to himself (rather a new operation, certainly), issued a prospectus of an " institution for factory reform and the employment of the deaf, dumb, and destitute "-a mere bubble affair, which was used solely for the purpose of obtaining an undue influence over the electors. Situations were promised in it freely to all the electors whQ would promise to vote, GH also issued a prospectus for the establishment of a carpet factory, vvhich was also used for the same purpose. Besides this undue influence, treating began very early in the cavass. Mr. Wood3bimself, while getting up the requisitfon to himself, actually condescended togo about treating the electors, and in some cases drinkin with them, to induce them to give him their signatures. ¶ntianidation also was practised, and he should be able to show too that money bribes had been offered repeatedly duringtheelectior, to various electors. A connter petition had been presented, charging Mr. Oliveira with bribery, treating, and intimida. tion, the only object of which was to frighten Mr. Oliveira, but it had no such effect, for he shoulld place Mr. Oliveira in the chair, and be woulld show most distinctly that on his part the election had been conducted in tho purest mauner posFible. After the usual formal evidenoe, Mr. Oliveira, the former member for Pontefract, was examined by Mr. E. JAMwES. 'I'he hon. gentlenian entered into a lengtbened history of his connexion with that borougb, con;mencing with the electio:x of l=52.

APPEALS. IO1TTS. OF T.O1RnR .TTnu ocz _ _ -- RPDGWVAY V. VHARTON. :Jnesr Lordships sat this morning for the purpose of deli. vering judgment in this case, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Brougham, Lord St. Ieonard's, Lord Wensleydale, and other Peers being present. This was an appeal aeainst a decree of the Lord Chancelor reversing a decree of Vice Chancellor Stuart, pro. nounced in a suit wherein the appelant was plaintiff and the respondentwas defendant. It appeared that the respondent, the Rev. Henry Wharton, was the owner in fee simple of certainproperty at Sydenham, in Kent, on which was an inn called the Grey. hound, which had been held by Messrs. Meux and Co., the brewers, under a lease from the respondent. The inn, together with a bowling-green and other premises, had been occupied by the appellant as tenant from year to year under Messrs. Meux and Co. In May, 1849, the ap. pellant caUed upon the respondent, and stated that he could arrange with Messrs. Meux and Co. for the purchase of the remainder of their term, which would expire at M[id. summer, 1852, and that he wished to have a lease of the Greyhound. According to the evidence of the appellant, in the course of this conversation the respondent stated that he should be satisfied with whatever Mr. Crawter, his surveyor, might arrange, but the respondent denied that any words to that effect were used, but that he simply said that Mr. Crawter should look at the premises. The appellant then alleged that the respond.nt instructed Mr. Crawter as his agent to arrange terms with the appelant for a lease, and that he sent the latt-r a letter to the effect that he had seen Mr. Crawter, and that that gentleman would see the appel. lant the next Saturday for the purpose of reee ring any communication he had to make. Mr. Crawter accordingly met the appelant and they talked the matter over together. mr. Crawter then made a report to the respondent recommending him to grant the appellant a 21 years' lease of the premises in question at a yearly rent of 701., the appelant to expend 6001. upon improvements. Mr. Crawter havlng seen the respondent upon the mnatter, wrote a letter, dated the 22d of June, 1849, to the appellant, to the effect that he had been requested by Mr. Wharton to see him with respect to granting the lease, and that if he would be at Carshaltoa upon a certain day he would bring the papers, and they could talk the matter over. They Accordingly met at Carshalton as appointed, and agreed upon the terms of a lease in accordance with the report furmnished by Mr. Crawter to Mr. Wharton. Mr. Ridgway, however, desired a little time for consideration, and they accordingly parted upon the understanding that Mr. Ridgway shouldwriteto Mr. Crawter stating his acceptance of the terms, and that Mr. Orawter should procure a formal agreement to be drawn up, embodying the terms so agreed upon, upon hearing from Mr. Ridgway that he accepted them. On July the 3d Mr. Ridgway wrote a letter to Mr. Crawter, asking for a longer term, but saying that if that was refused he would accept the terms already offered, and requiring the agreement to be drawn up at once. Under these eircumstances the appellant conceived that the terms fora lease were fully adfinally settled between the parties. Mr.Crawter communicatedtheterms to the respondent, and he was requested by the latter to send the particulars of the proposed lease to Messrs. Gregson, the respondent's solicitors, for the purpose of having a formal agreement for a lease drawn up. Pursuant to that direction Mr. Crawter sent a paper to Messrs. Gregson containing the particulars of the agreement for a lease, but it was without any signature. Mr. Ridgway not hearing from Mr. Crawter as he expected, wrote a letter on the 27th of August, requesting him to send the formal agreement, and he reeeived a letter from Mr. Crawter in reply, stating that he bad given instructions to Messrs. Gregson to prepare the agreement. It also stated that Mr. Taylor, a gentleman connected with Messrs. Meux and Co., had been endeavouring to learn the " terms arranged" with him. The appeDant did not urchase the residue of Messrs. Meux and Co.'s lease, being dissuaded from doing so by Mr. Crawter, on the ground of the premises being out of repair, and thece being a claim against Messrs Meux and Coo. for dilapida. tions. The appellant, considering that the agreement entered into with Mr. Crawter was binding, did nottrouble himself about the matter until April, 1852, -when he agai applied for the agreement, To his great surDpise he was told that in consequence of the Crystal Palaee being removed to Sydenham property had greatly improved, and that a rent of 1301. or 1401. would be expected. He decined to give more than he had previously agreed upon, and commenced a suit for the specific performance of the agreement he bad entered into. The case for the respondent, as sworn to by himself and Mr. Crawter, was, that hehadnever authorized Mr. Crawtb r to agree to the terms of a lease as his agent, but that he had simply requested him to negotiate with the appelant f r the purpose of finding out what he would agree to. It we n further submitted that, even if there had been authority to Mr. Crawter, the latter had not made a conclusive and bind. ing agreement with the appellant, and that the written pape r sent to Mr. Wharton's solicitor was not an agreement signE d hy the respondent or his agent within the meaning of the Statute of Frauds, The cause was heard in July, 1853, before Vice-Chancellor Stuart, who ordered that the respondent should grai.t the appellant alease in accordance with the terms of tl a written paper sent to Messr. Gregson, being of opinion that Crawter was the authorized agent of the respondent, aLd considering that the written paper handed to Messrs. Gregson contained the terms of an agreement actually concluded between Mr. Crawter and the appellant. This decisicn having been appealed from on the 11th of January, 1854, the Lord Chancellor reversed the decision of the ViceChancellor, who, although of opinion that Mr. Crawt r had received sufficient authority from the respondent to grant a lease, yet held that no binding agreemeLt had been made by that gentleman. From that decree the present appeal had been brought, and it was heard during last year before the Lord Chancellorand LordBrougham. It was then, however, directed that it should be re- argued by one counsel of a side, and accordingly, on the 18th inst.. Mr. R. Palmer was heard for the appellant and the Attorney-General for the respondent, when their Lordships took time to considertheir judgment. The LoRD CHANCELLOR, in delivering his judgment tb S morning, said, that he had altered his opinion upon one point,-namely, with respect to Mr. Crawter having been sufficiently authorized by Mr. Wharton to agree to a lease. Re was now clearly of opinion that he had received Lo such authority. He stiM considered that there was no COL. elusive agreement between the parties, it not having been their intention to bind themselves until the terms had been reduced into form. Under these circumstanceshe (the Loid Chancellor) was of opinion that the appellant had failed in making out his case, and that the decree of the Court below munst be affirmed. Lord BROUGHAM, in concurring with the opinion of his noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, could not help expressing himself in terms of praise with respect 1o the fair, open, and manly manner in Mwhich that noble lord had stated his change of opinion, instead of keeping on in the wrong for the sake of preserving his so-called consistency. If the candid course adopted by his noble friend had always been followed there would not have been so much bad law in the books as was, unfortunately, to be found there. Lord ST. LEONARD'S delivered a long and elaborate judgment, in which he differed from his noble and learned friends on both points. He considered that the letters which we? e produced established a sufficient authority from the rea ondent to Mr. Crawter, and he also was of opinion that t ere bad been a valid contract for a lease entered into between Mr. Crawter and the appellant. Under these circumstances he was of opinion that the judgment of the Court below ought to be reversed. Lord WENSLEYDALE concurred in the opinion expressed by the Lord Chancellor and Lord Brougham. The appeal was then dismissed without costs.

VICE-CAIANCELLTORIS VTrr .T x -- -- ZMON YPENNY V. MONEYPENNV (Before Vice-Chanc<llor Sir W. P. won .ws 1oliOUR, assisted by Mr. Baron Bramwell and Mr. Baron Watson, was occupied during the greater part of the day with the arguments in this case, which arose on the con. struction of a settlementk the question being whether a grant of an annuity or rentcharge to be issuing out of a par. ticular estate, to which it afterwards appeared the grantor had no title beyond his own life, created an implied covenant under which the grantee might now go against his general estate, be being dead. The case was argued by Mr. Rolt, Mr. Willcock, Mr. Daniel, Mr. Berkeley, Mr. C. Hal, Mr. Wickens, Mr. Baggallay, and Mr. Honyman (of the common Lit bar). Te learned judges reserved their judgment. JOEL V. ?,ILS.-HARVEY V. ILLS. Tlife questionAsr these causes turned on the effect of a very singular will and codicil, by which the testator bad given to one Mills certain interests in his estate, with provisoes attached of such a nature as that hbis interest should cease on his attempting to alien or charge it, or on his doing any act by whic it should vest in other persons. Some of the creditors of Mills bad attempted in the firstsuit to attach his interest under the will, on the ground that the mode in which the testator had sought to effect his object was contrary to the policy of the law. Thereupon the trustees filed the bill in the second suit, to have the construction of the will determined and the trusts carried into execution. Mr. Rolt, Mr. Willcock, Mr. Cairns. Mr. Headlam, Mr. Elderton, Mr. Southgate, Mr. E. E. Kay, and Mr. Buxton appeared for the several parties. Jlis HONOnn gave judgment on the general effect of the will, deciding that the truats were well declared, and that Millsi having suffered a judgment to be registered against him his interest had thereby become forfeited. Another point sitill remainS to be argued.
COUIRT OF QUEWS BENCH, WXMnNsTm, JUNE 26. EOUX V. W1SE?A.N. tOWIngs rn .tianeo, oe;ore Alr. rUe8tice COLERnIGF, Mr. Jutice WiGInxzN. and Mr. Justice CROMPTON.j 'ms was an ction in which the plaintiff, the Abbe Roux, sued the defendant, Cardinal Wiseman, to recover damages for the detention of a security for 25,000 francs, which had been given to ;the plaintiff by Madame Letitia Wyse, but which the plaintiff alleged he had intrusted to the defendant for a purpose. At the trial, which took place before Mr. Justice Crowder at the last awsizes at Glocester, the plintiff obtained a verdict with o00. damages. Subsequently a rule was granted for a new trial, upon the ground t at te verdict was against the evidence, and also that the damages were excessive. On a pzevious da7 MIr. Serjeant Pigott and MEr. Griffits wrere heard to show cause against Mr. HuDDLESTO, Q.C., was now heard on the same side. The SoiaciToitGE ALa and Mr. PHrs'soN were also heard in support of the rule. During the argument, Mr. Justice CoLrRIDGz stated that the learned judge who presided at the trial had expressed no dissatisfaction with the verdict, but only as to the amount of the damages. At the close of the argument, Mr. Justice COLERIDOE said it would be more satisfactory if theretwere a new trial. The rule would therefore be made ahsolute on payment of costs. Rule absolute on payment of costs. The Court then proceeded with the cases in the Crown Paper, but nothing occurred of general interest. This was the last day of the sittings in Banco tll Satur. day, the 4th of July, when the Court will sit to give judgment in cases previously argued. (Sitings at NiSi Prius before Lord CAMPELL and a Common Jury.) PFANY NORTON V. BIUCH AN, MIr. Charnock and MIr. Cook Evans were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Klarsake and Mr. Medcalfe for the defendant. This action was brought to recover damages for false imprisonment. The- defendant put on the record a plea of Justification, that he had probable cause for believing that the plaintiff was guilty of a felony, and also that she had given a false character. The defendant is a shopkeeper at 215. Piccadilly, and the plaintiff was in his service as a housemaid. Mrs. Bnchanan charged the plaintiff with having robbed her of some plated forks and other artioles, and then caused her to be taken into custody by a policeman, She war taken to the police station at Vine-street, where she was placed in a cell with three other women, one of whom was drunk. She was kept there all night, and the next morning she was taken through the streets to the Marlborolugh-street Police-office, and the charge was gone into before the magistrate, when she was discharged. The present action was then brought. The plantiflt a smart young girl, was examined at great length, aud she gave the history of her going into the servioe of the defendant, and stated that her *ather was a clerk in the city :-In 1856 I was in the service of a Mr. EmanueL I applied to several ladies for a situation, but they refused, because I had lived in a Jew's family, aud Itherefore told the defendant I had been in the service of a Mrs. Appleyard. On the 7th of January I was engaged by Mrs. Buchanan. There was a cupboard in the parlour, of which Mrs. Buchanan had the key, but sometimes the other servants had it. There were assistants in the shop. I was generaLy in the kitchen. On the 18th of February, before a party, Mrs. Buchanan said she was several spoons short. I said I knew nothing about them. On the day after the parVty she said a veil had beeu lost, and it was picked up with my garter by the side of it. She said she had lost several spoons, and forks, and knives. She asked me my address and Mr Appleyard's, which I gave her. Mrs. Buchanan said she would search my box. I unlocked it, and she looked over it. She found a little slver trinket, and asked me where I got it. I said my fathergave it me. She said she should like to know how he got it, She afterwards told me she could give me a free passage to Australia, as she found I had not lived with Mrs. Auleyard. I explained the circumstances to her, and. tol' her she was my aunt. The defendant then said. hewouldgive me into custody. I asked him to send for my father; he refused. I was taken by a policeman through the streets to Vine-street. I was put into a cell without a bed and without a light. There were three other women in the cell; one was drank. The next morning I was taken along the streets to Marlborough-street. Vrs Buchanan gave her evidence, and then the magistrate discharged me. I went back to the house, and Mr. Buchanan said he would not mind if it cost him 10. if he could punish mne. Cross-examined.-I did not clean the knives there. I did not know the contents of the cupboard, and never had any listgven me. I did not deny that the garter was mine. lhad 1s. of my own when I entered the service. I never went out of the house without being sent by Mrs. Buchanan. Mrs. Buchanan once told me that Miss Buchanan had lost a black chain, and that I was the only person who had been in the room, and there was a great deal of bother about it. In a few days there was a party, and I saw Miss Buchaean wearing the very chain. I said, " Miss Ellen, I am very glad you have found your cbain; whero did you find it?,' She replied, " I never lost it; Ma had it." I said she ought to be careful how she charged servants with stealing things when she had put them away. From the evidence of some of the witnesses, it seemed that Mrs. Buchanan frequently complained of butter and soap and other things being taken. The servants remained but a short time. The plaintiff's mother proved that she had given her two cotton dresses. For the defendant, who had pleaded a justification, it was urged that he was perfectly justified in giving the girl into custody, for many things were lost after she came into the service. ITpon the occasion of there being a party a lace veilwas found in a room in which the plaintiff had Been, and by it side a garter which belonged to the plaintiff Some knives which had been taken from the cupboard could not be found. The plaintiff was questioned, and she said she had cleaned the knives and pat them back, but the knives were not there. Some spoons were also missing, and the next day a girl who was in the service, named Ellen Leary, brought them to Mrs. Buchanan and said she had found them in a cupboard in a room in which the servants slept. The plaintiff had stated upon coming into the service that she had lived with a Mrs. Appleyard, and upon these things being missed Mrs. Buchanan went to Mrs. Appleyard, who stated that she knew nothing about the girl, and that she had never lived with her; and then Mrs Buchanan had given the plaintiff into custody. Mrs. Buchanan said,-In January Isst the plaintiff came into my service. She said she had been 16 months with Mrs. Appleyard, and had left because the wages were too low. I did not go to Mrs. Appleyard. The plaintiff was housemaid. She had charge of a cupboard in the parlour in which were knives and forks. It was open for eight da.ys after plaintiff came; and it was aftr that time that I took her to the cupboard and told her she would have chaee of the things in that cupboard, and said there are 3. dozen of teaspoons, and b dozen and 9 of platd forks and 10 dessert spoons, 4 large tablespcons, and 2 dozen ivory-handledi forks, 2 dozen of small knives, and 1 dozen of large, 3 carving knives and forks. I desired her to look over them. She did look over them with me. After that the cupboard was kept locked. I kept the kev, and when things were wanted gave the key to Fanijy Norton. About a fortnight after she came I missed some collars, handkerchiefs, and stockings, and my daughter's ring. I did not miss any money. They were missed at different times. I said those things were missed, but I made no charge. During a party on the 19th of January I heard of a veil and a garter being found, and the day after I missed 2i dozen of forks. I did not make complaint of the loss before the party; but the day after I said I would take an account of the things in the cupboard, and then the things were brought out of the cupboard, and I counted them over in the presence of the plaintiff, and there were one dozen teaspoons and twvo dozen forks and six dessert spoons, half a dozen small knives missing. The plaintiff said she had put the knives back in the cupboard. She said that eight days before she went to look over the things, and she thought I must have been mistaken in the numbers. The day of the party I had given the plaintiff the key of the cupboard to get out the tbings which were necessary. She shortly afterwards gave me back the key. The day after I had examined the cu board Ellen leary brought me two dessert spoons, and said sh had found them in her cupboard in the nursery, that they were not there at 8 o'clock in the morning, and she wished me to make an inquiry. Immediately after that the plaintiffs boxes were searched. About 2s. 2d. was found in copper. Ellen said the plaintiff generally had a quantity of copper money; that when she came in from an errand she brought a few ece tiU it amounted to a few shillings, aometime 5,, ad tben ashe took it out and changed it into silver. Ellen said upon one oocasion she had Eeen her bring in a cap and ace ear. The plintiff would not speak upon this being said. Mr. Buchanan said she might have had the money when she first came. Ellen said, "I don't think so, bocause she hsd no. noney to buy two cotton dresses which she would like to have done, and there was sickness in her mother'8 fanily, that she oould not afford to give her any," After th I went to M Applegazd, who told me the plaintiff had not been with her. She knew nothing of any one of the name. I asked Mr. Applerard if she had not reoeived a letter from the plaintiff, asking when I could see her, and she said sh had, but sho thought it was a piece of nonsene, and threw it in the fire. On my return the plaintiff was called up and told what Mis. Appleyard had said. The paintiff then said that lMr Appleyard was her mother's sister. I said, " Whid y not tell me that at first ?" She said, "I thought bhe woould have spoken for me, because, to teil you the truth, I was very insolent to my hat mistress, and she turned me off at a minuWst otice." I never told her I would give her a free passage to Amstralia. I said I should give her into custody bhe said, " I wish you would send to my father." Mr. Buchanan said it would be something like sending to Mm Appleyard. After that she was given into custody. A lodger had complained of sdrawer being broken open. I never missed mosey. Crowsexamined.-After Ann Cook, the cook, went Ellen Leary took her place from the 7th of Febrtsary till the 205h,the day after the party. Fanny MNorton was the only other female servant, I dare sy havo ha four coohm wi the last three or four years.I never char-ged them writh robbingme. InevertoldM Appleyardso. The pLaintiff never brought me money which she said she had picked up I never gave the plaintiff a written inventory of the things. which were in the cupbosrd. The plaintiff was always oor. rect in giving me the right change. Mr. Btiuchlnan.-I am the defendant. About a fortnight before the plaintiff left I heard compWnts of things being missing. had before heard of some small articles being missed. IadvisedmywifetogoandsenMr Appleyard.When the plaintiff boxes were searched Ellen sad she thought it her duty to let me know the strange ways the Iipntiff had of doing. When she had been out she generaUybrought in some coppers with her, and when it amounted to 5s. she would take it out and get silver for it. The plaintiff heard this and said nothing. I asked plaintiff where she got the money, and she made nb answer. Ellen Ieary then said that the plaintiff when she first came told her that she had On money. After mv wife had been to lrs. Applcyard she told me she had Eeer; her, and found that the plaintiff had never lived with her, and that she knew nothing of her, and advisel my wife to give her In eharge. I then called the plaintiff into the room, and asked-her how long she ws with Mrs. Appleyard. She said, "Nne orl2months." I sid her mistress had 'ust seen Mrs. Appleard, who said she knew nothing of er. The plaintiff then said she never had been withMrs. Appleyard, and that all she had stated was false, but that Mrs. Apppleyard was her aunt. I then sent for a polioeman. Cross-examined.-I frequently have friends come, and sometimes give parties. I have never seen an inventory of the plate. i leave those matters to my wife. Ihave sometimes hearrd of things being missed in the house. On the night of the party I think there was a charwoman in the kitchen. The plaintiff said, " Send for my father;' but I considered she was all false together. Ellen Leary.-I was and am nurserymsid to Mr Buchanan. I entered three dys before the plaintiff cme. She told me she came from P hlico, where she had h the care of a child for 1S months. She said she should like to buy two new cotton dresses if she had the money, bat she had not. Shesaidsheshouldbhae hadit, onlyhermotherhad some illness at home. In about a fortnight after she came I missed my earrings out of my pocket, which was hanging in a bsok room where our boxes were. In a day or two after there were oomplaints about oollars and handkerchiefs and stockings being missed. I heard the cock complain of butter and soap and other things being missed. I heard of a veing found in the drawingroom. I remember the party of the l9th of February. 1 heard of the spoons being missed. I saw two spoons in the nursery cupboard. I hal cleaned the nursery spoons at & o'clock that morning, and those two spoons were not there then. They were not the nusery spoons. I found these spoons at 10 o'clock. The plaintiff had been in the nurser several times duringthat morning. I took the spoons down to Mrs. Buchanan as soonas ifoundthem,and Iaskedhertoseeintoit,sIdid not wish to be blamed for what others were doing. I have seen the plaintiff bring coppers into the house two or three times in s day. I have seen er take out those coppers afterwards, 5g.-worth, and she brought in five shillings for them. She showed me the silver when she brought it back. I have asked the plaintiff how she came to have the coppers in her possesion. She said when she wanted to purchase anything tbhat she took silver out of her box, and brought in the change. I never saw anything that she had purchased. I told all this to Mrs. Buchuann. I had never been to the cupboard in which the plate was but once, and that was to put some things in because the plaintiff refused to put the things away. The plaintiff sat in the room while I and the cook put them away. Cross-examined.-The cook cleaned the knives. I was not called Snmith, nor did I receive letters in that name. Ann Cook did not write a letter for me in the name of Ann Smith. I saw the plaintiffs mother bring her a bundle, and in two days afterwards the plaintiff showedme two cotton dresses. The plaintiffand I were the only two servants on the day of the party. The plaintiff waited at table, and then brought the things down tothe kitchen where I was. Everything was cleared up that night. Idon't knowwhether there was a charwoman in the house for a fortnight before the party. I did not say that I thought I had lost the ear. rings in the street. I had not taken them out with me. The plaintiff then called- Elizabeth AppleyarL-I am the daughter of Mr Apple. yard. The plaintiff is a cousin of mine, and my mother is ner aunt. Wrs. Buchanan called and requested the character of Fanny. I said I did not know we had had any one of that name, as I had been from home. My mother was out at the time. 3Mrs Buchanan said she had been fearfully robbed of plato. She said that at Christmas she had had a party of 70, and there was sufficient plate for three courses. She said she had not looked over the account to see what plate she had lost, but she knew she had lost a great deal. She said she had been robbed by all her servants. Oross-examined.-I dare say I had seen the plaintiff a month before at our house. Re-examine.-The plaintiff had many times been with us on a visit. Mrrs. Appleyard.-I amt the aunt of the plaintiff, who had many times stayed at my house as a visitor. I let lodgings. Mmrs Buchanan caled on me. She was much excited. She wanted to know if Fanny Norton had lived with me as servant, and I said, " No." She said she had been referred to me. I never said I knew nothing of Fanny Norton. She said she had been fearfully robbed by Fanny Norton and by every servant she had; that she had been robbed by a servant at Ramsgate of dozens of pairs of btockings and wearing appareL She said she gave the key of the cupboard to the housemaid occasionaRy. She found after the party that she was dreadfully robbed. f certainly did not advise her to get a policeman and give Fanny into custody. She said she would transport Fanny Norton and every servant who zobbed her, as she had been shamefully robbed ever since she was married. Cross-examined.-I had received a letter before this, but it was written in so inferior a hand that I could not read it, and I put it in the fir I did not read it nor look at the signature. I saw a name of Mrs Buchanan at the top. Ms. Buchanan asked me if I hbd received a letter, and I said, "Yes, and I put it.inthe fire." Ree wamined.-It was not Fanny Norton's writing. Ann Cook.-I wrote a letter, and addreseed it to " lUen Smith, at Ms. Buchanan's, 215, Piccadilly." I knew EUen Leary as Ellen Smith. I posted it. (The plaintiff stated that that letter came, and she deli. vered it to Ellen Leary.) Cross-examined.-I wrote a letter for the plaintiff soon after she came and directed it to Mrs. Appleyard. I signed it " Fanny Norton." I did not write my best. By the COuRT.-The letter to Mrs. Appleyard was to ask her to see Mrs. Buchanan. It was stated by counsel that the missing articles had never been found. Lord CArPBELL, in summing up, saidthiswas a most important case. The great question would be whether they considered the facts as stated in the plea were made out because the charge against the defendant was for havin given the plaintiff into custody. The defendant said he had reasonable ground for believing that the plaintiff had committed a felony. He should have to ask thenm what was their opinion of the facts proved, and then ho should have to say whether the facts amounted to such a reasonable and proba,ble cause as would justify the defendant in giving, the plaintiff in charge for a felony. HE thought humanity would have dictated that the girls father should have been sent for, that the inquiry might havetaken p lace in his presence. First, then, was there a felony Had any of the articles been stolen ? The Jury.-No, my Lord. Lord CA'sPBnL.-.Then, that puts an end to the plea, and the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict; but the damages ought to be very small, because the plaintiff had acted very improperly in saying that she had lived as servant with Mrs. Appleyard. The Jury.-We think the defendant ought to have applied for the character beforehand. Lord CAMPBELL.-Probably but for this unfortunate story told by the plaintiff the thing would noet have hap. pened. No doubt, the plaintiff had suffere-very severe in being thus locked np. The jury retired, and at length found a verdict for the paintift, damages 30L., and that the plaintiff left the court without a stain upon her character. This was the last cause in the list, which has been now entirely disposed of. The Court sits to-morrowY at Guildhatt. SECOND COURT. (Before Mlr. Justice EnLE and a SpeciaW Jury.) BERAT V. THE 1,O2WDON, BRIGHTON, AND SOUTH COAST RAILWAY COMPANY. Mr. Knowles, Mr. Wilde, and Mr. Hindmarsh were counselforthe plaintiff- Mr. Bovill, Mr. Webster, and Mr. Aston for the defendants. The declarations stated that the plaintiff bad in the year 1840 obtained a patent effecting an improvement in the locomotive engines, carriages, and wheels in use on railways, which the defendants had infringed. Tho defendants pleaded, in the first place, that they had not been guilty of the alleged infringement; in the second place, that there was no sufficient speoification; that the plaintiff was not the first inventor of the improvement in question; that it was not a new invention; and, lastly, the Statute of limtitations. It appeared that the plaintiff was an engineer. He had for seme time acted in ,the capacity of chief locomotive engineer to the London and South-Western Railway Com- pany. He alleged he had given to the world a very useful invention, which from the date of its discovery had been adopted by almost every railway in the country, and which consisted in the construction of a lathe by which two railway wheels might be bored and turned at the same time and driven from or by the same cone pulley. By means of the ordinary lathe which had previously been in use only one wheel at a time could be bored or turned, and the result of the invention bad been not only increased economy, but increased efficiency aud certainty in the working of the machinery. The patent had expired in the year 1855, but the invention had at that time been adopted bythe.ailwaycomlpaie gen!rally, &ni been used by the defendant- without the payment oE that royalty to the plintiff which he had a right to demand.

COURT OP BAYRAUPTCT, Friday, June 26. I1R 31ALL AND HALL. up- (Izpf"p U. -.- vvena couArtps were soiicitors and cattle dealers of Bog. This was an adjourned examination meetin r. -0wrance appeared for the assignees; Ar. Rivimgton for Sir Charles Rushout, a creditor for about 45,0004; Air. Linldater appeared for other creditors. Notwithstanding the numerous adjonrsments that have taken place the bankruptW accounts were not yet ready, and it was suggested that on this occasion the adjourmnent should be without protection. The CoeSSiosB doubted whether such a course would. not be inurious to the state. Any further allowance would he withheld, and there would be an adiournment to the 25th of July,with an admonition to the bankrupts that they must then show that they had used due diligence in the preparation of their accounts. Mrs. TilbY, a creditor, complrnned that about two acres of land at Willesden, upon which 42 horse-boxes had beexs erected, were stll in possession of the bankrupts. The value of the property was upwards of 3,0004 In reply to the COURT Cheslyn Hall stated that the land had been allotted in blank by the Enclosure Commissioners, and he did not know whose property it was. The Co jmsmox remarked that this was a curious state of things-an allotment in blnk How long had the property been in possession of the bankrupts? Ceslyn Hall replied since 1838, when his father died. The other bankrupt replied since 1832 or 1834. The CoMaMnSIoyR.-Have you ever paid any rent?' The bankrupts explained that no rent had been paid, anti that there was a bill of costs against the Enclosure Coin. missioners They were not the owners of the property; but they could not state whose it was; or that the property really had an owner. It was now in possession of the purehaser of some adjoining leasehold land, as sold by their assignees. The creditor strongly denied that this was so. The property had been represented by one of the banlrupts to be theirs, and the matter ought to be inquired into. Hne HoNOUR directed the official assignee to institute the necessary inquiry. IN RE JAMS MAY. The bankrupt was a linendraper and hosier, of l27, Gos. well-street. This was the examination meeting. Mr. Mason opposed, Mr. Iawrance supported. It appeared that the bankrupt commenced business in October last with a capital of 504 A further sum of 1004 was lent him by one lMyers for which he gave his biUls at two mnonths ; 12. 10s. was charged by Myers for this loan. Subsequently Myers lent him 5. for 10 days, and forwhich loan yers was paid 14 5s., or at the rate of about 80 per cent. The bankrupt explained that an entry in his book of 801. paid tJohn Ai:d May (his nephew) referred to two or three paymnents at different periods which made up that amount. He bad bought goods from John Hind May, and prt of the money paid had been borrowed of Myers. Myers ha-da'upplied himi with goods as well as cash, and was now a crediter for about 40s The CommRaowim directed a summons to issue against Myers, who must be prepared on Thursdav next with a statement of his transactions with the bankript.

POLICE. MAXSION-lHOU8s.-Willim IBoAeoy, lerk and bookkeeper to Mr. W. Cowdery, colonial brdker of Fenchurch. steet, was tried before Sir R. W. CA'RDEN and Sir J. Du;, at petty sessions, upon the charge of having feloni. ously stolen on order for the pavmeirt of 201. 1Bs., the property of his employer. The evidence of the prosecutor had ceen given upon the first examination. The prisoner pleaded " Guilt2y.' Sir P, W. CARDEN, addresssli the prsoner, said,-.My brother magistrate and I have [oked into the matter of thischarge, and we agree in thinking that it is our duty to indit upon a man guilty of such an -offence the heaviest punishment we can award under the Act. We therefore seetence the prisoner to be imprisoned for sLx calendar months in the House of Correction, and to be subjected to bard labour during that time. James Merr, George Harding, W. Watson, J. Hale, J. Barrow, T. ordsworth, H. Jaokson, E. Cartis, C. Mannig, and W. Mawwfield were placed at the table charged fs ollows: Mr. Stuchbury, from the City Solicitor's offace, attended or the posecution. J. Butt deposed that on the 3d of June he went to a room of a beershop, No. 10, Talbot-ourt, Gracechurch-4treet, and W Merry behind a counter, several other persons boing present in front of the oeunter, who made bets vith Meri:7 upon different horseraces. Slates were plaoed up m view of the persons in the roomi, on which were written the names of horseences and the prices at wbich they could be backed. Merry made a bet with Butt of 61. to 1t. against a horse called Cedric, for the Union Cup race at Manuchester, and it appeared that Merry, on every occasion of making a bet, retired behind a small partition in the room, for the purpose, as it was stated, of enterinm the bet. It also appeared that Butt (the witness) had -visited the room on several occasions, both before and after the 3d of June, and had always seenx Merry there, and numbers of persons betting with him upon horseraoes, and slates exposed to view. Marshal, 215, gave evidence to the effect that he had seen betting on different occaions going on in front of the bar of the same house, and had unsuccessfully endeavoured to get into the room in which Merry was, but was prevented by a person whom witness identified aethe defendant Harding, who guarded the door of the room, and who stated to the witness that he had injunctions not to let any persons in who were unknown, and that they were obliged to be veg esreful withwhom they betted. Hawks, 175, corroborated the previous witness. Inspector Hamilton deposed that he apprehended the defendants that day at 12 o'clock, and produced a number of slates, lists, and other documents relative to horseracing which he had found in Mlery's possession. Several other constables produced books and papers, whioh they had found on the other defendants. Merry in 'he course of the proceedings intimated that he was disposed to plead guilty, as he could not rebut the charge. The case, however, proceeded, and in conclusion, in answer to the charge, he again said that he could not rebut the evidence adduced against him, and he threw him. self on the mercy of the Court. Alderman WIRuE discharged all the defendants except Merry and Harding with admonitions. He said it was im. ssible to meet the justice of the case witbout sending Merry to prison for three months, with hard labour, and Harding, who had acted for Merry in guarding the entrance, for 21 days, with hard labour. Alirry had been convicted of keeping a betting-house in drooked-lane in June last year, and it was stated that his betting transactions amounted to several thousands. He gave notice of appeal, and was bailed the day after the examination. In the report of proceedings at the Mansion-house in Die Times of Thursday against several persons for being concerned in betting transactions it was mentioned that some of the defendants were taken into custody at the King's Arms, Bishopsgate-street. Mr. A. T. Hayward, the proprietor of that house, requests us to state that nothing of the kind occurred at his house, and that he does not allow bettiag transactions of any kind to take place there. GrILDIsALL.-John Baker, acias Wood, alias Hunt, eiaes Wilmott, wa placed at the bar before Sir R. W. CARBEN, charged with obtaining goods to the value of 171. 10s. under falso pretences, with intent to defraud Messrs. Schlesinger and Co., merchants and drysalters of Basinghall-street. Mtr. Moss said there were other cases against the prisoner. but be was not prepared to complete them yet. If, however,the prisoner were remanded the publcity of the case in the newspapers would be the means of bringing many other oases agaainst him. The prisoner was then remanded, and at his own suggestion the bail was fixed in one surety of 801., and his own recoguizances in a similar amount. BoW-sTRsEr.-Thomas Simmonds was charged with stealing a valaablo gold watch from Mr. William F'reeman, of Ailsa-park, Twickenham, who had come to town to witness the distribution of the Victoria Crosses that day. Mr. Freeman was passing along the Strand, in tbe direction of the Park, when he got into a crowd near the Electric Telegraph Company's office. While there he felt a tug at his chain, but without missing his watch. He went on and entered the National Gallery, where, however, he remained only a few minutes, when, desiring to know the time, he felt for his watch and found it was gone, He immediately left the Gallery, intending to give information. at the police-court. When he got lnto the street he found the prisoner engaged in a struggle wibh a sergeant of Fusileers, a police-constable, and some other persons,who had just apprehended him. It appeared that the sergeant, Charles P'almer, liad seen the prisoner snatch the watch from prosecutor's pocket, and had at once started off in pursuit, without waiting to speak to the prosecutor, who was pretty sure to make inquiries when he missed his watch. The sergeant overtook and seized him in Trafalgarsquare, when a bystander saw him throw the watch into an area. It was picked up and shown to prosecutor, who recognized it as his own. It was uninjured, except breaking the handle by wresting it from the chain and sLashing the glass. MIr. Freeman expressed his astonishment at the dexterity with which the robbery was effected. He had been many years a magistrate and had never met with such a case. Mr. HENRY.-Ah ! in the country that may be so, but I can assure you that they are common enough in London. It is alwvays done in the same way, by breaking the mere piece of wire which joins the head. The prisonerpleaded "Guilty." He said he had formerly been in the militia, but was draughted into the Land Transport Corps. Since that body was disbanded he had been -unemployed. MNr. HERY sentenced him to four months' imprisonment. MRLfLOROUGGH-STRERT.-TheE pickpockets mustered in great force at the proceedings in flyde IPark yesterday; the detectiveq were, however, on the alert, and brought without intermission during the day to this court batches of thieves as they were captured. IVE.I'llMNTER4-1Os. has been received from "X X. Y.' for Airs. Saunders, and an acknowledgment is requested in Tltne Times. SoUTsI WAiux.-Tbomas Crundwell, a respectable-lookin your g n,an, JSa brought up for final esanimnatlon, charbcd hobtaining the SUmU of 1 a. osfrom r. James BankF, a baker, of 34, Queen-street, New-cut, Lambetb, under false and frandulent pretenCeS ; also for forging a document on the South-Eastern R?ailway Compauy. Mr. Solomon prosecuted and Mr. Charnock defended the psoer. Mr. Banks stated that on Monday afternoon. the 15th inst., the prisoner called upon him with a sample of flour, stating that he had a small quantity for sale at a reasonable price. He also said that he was agent to Mr. Mercer, flour factor and miller of Dartford, who bad forwarded a large quantity to the Bricklayers' Arms Station, and that all had been disposed of but five sacks, which he might have for 101. 5s, The prisoner also said that he had just sold W0 sacks to Mr. Fullwood, of Blackman-street. Witness examined the sample, and consented to buy the flour at the price, and at the prisoner's earnest request he paid hifn the money, on his promising to send the flour the same evening. The prisoner, at the same time, gave him a receipt, Eigning it for the South-Eastern Railway Company, Bricklayers' Arms Station, and then he left. Finding that the flour did not come, he went on Tuesday morning to Mr. Fullwood, and asked him about his 30 sacks,when le denied having purchased any of the prisoner or anybody else from the South-Eastern Railway Company. Witness after that wvent to the Bricklayers' Arms Station, and ascertaining all that to be false, be went to Dartford, and gave the prisoner into custody at his mother's house. In cross-examination witness said he had previously known the prisoner as traveller to a flour dealer in the Blackfriars-road, but he never before ihad any dealings with him. Witness did not know that he had received six months for embezzlenent until after he gave him into custody. Evidence being provea by Mr. Pierson, the manager of the Bricklayers' Arms Station, as to the prisoner's falsehood and forgery, The magistrate committed him for trial.

DBSCENLDANTS OF REMARKABLE PEOPLE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have read the appeal which has been made in your columns for some supposed descendants of Shakspeare's sister, and a controversy which seems to have arisen out of it, and I am encouraged to make another appeal of a similar description, which I think demands precedence. I believe, Sir, that you will agree with me, that one of the most remarkable and distinguished men whom this world has yet seen was our father Adam. As I am not qnite sure of the accuracy of the many likenesses of Adam which have appeared in the shapes of paintings and statues, I will not base an appeal in favour of any particular individual on the ground of his striking resemblance to one of them, but there are a considerable number of people who may justly claim descent, not from Adam's sister, but direct from Adam himself, and many of these are equally justly objects in various ways of our commiseration. Considering, therefore, our obligations to that great man' I would suggest, as a slight modification of the scheme proposed by Mx. Howitt, that the penny subscription should form "a fund for the education, benefit and provision in old age, where required, of the descendants of Adam;" and, I would add, in Mr. How t.'s own words-" Sach an estate founded by the peol le would be the noblest monument ever yet erected to any Dian on any occasion."' I remember that a few years ago one of our writers upon the life of Shakspeare declared that the most important question yet unsolved relating to the great poet was, who was Shakspeare's maternal great grandmother? Might we not just as weU hunt up the descendants of Shakspeare's great grandmother as those of his sister? I feel the more interest in pressing my view of the subiect bceqa%s T. --If Rio - rn W sw- ONE OF ADAM'SDESCENDANTS. June 25.

A meeting of the committee of the Worcestershire Agriculiual Society has since been held, at which it was determlined to make an appeal to the law in the event of such condact being repeated. It was also resolved that "for the convenience of persons attending the fairs who are desirous of availing themselves of sales by auction, such sales be recognized by this meeting, and that a deputation (named) be appointed to wait upoa the Mayor and town-council to ask for a sufficient force to trotect the farmers and others at Worcester fairs and mar- ets in the se of their stock by auction or otherwise; and that they be requested to apportion particular places in the market for sales by auction." The farmers are determined to exercise their own judgment as to vhether they shall sell their stock by auction or by private hand, and tie butchers are equally determined to resist what they consider an encroachment upon their privileges.

IRELAND. THES MUR1 D OF MR. LITTLE. (FROM OUR OWNI ' DUBLIN. FRIDAY MORIJn- Although nothing very material has been permitted to transpire since Wednesday, when the discovery of the money was made, the papers of this morning contain some information respecting the progress of the inquiry before the police authorities which is not without interest. The following is from the Freemaifs ounial - " It having been generaDy understood that the prisoner, James SpoDen, at present confined in Frederick-lane policestationhouse, charged with the murder of Mr. Little, would be brought up for examination in Capel-street police-ofice yesterday morning, a large rumber of persons assembled ia the office and round the doors tbrough which SpolUen was expected to pass, but they were destined to be disappointed, as the Crown decided on postponing the examination of the prisoner, for the purpose of obtaining some additional and important evidence. As wve have already stated, 'the prisoner was not aware of his wif.e havinlg given information against him until he saw her in J?rederick-lane stationhonse on the occasion of his being charged by Mr. Superintendent Guy. On that occasion, after he hdA been brought down stairs to the reserve room, he appeared quito astonished when he saw his wife. Aftet the charge had been duly entered and read to him the pocketsof his clothes were searched in theiusual way and in them a key was found, -with other matters. He objected to it being taken from him, and said that it was the key of his private drawer, and that they had no right to deprive him of it. This key was intrusted to one of the police, who went to the prisoner's house late on Wednesday night, and found that it opened a drawer in a cheat irn the parlour of his residence. In the drawer eight sovereigns were found rolled upinaplece of wadding, which had the appearance of haviDg been in a muddy place, as portions of clay were adhering to it. The police are of opinion that this money was taken from the place where the gold and notes were found the day prev;ous by Sergeant Meyers. From the time the prisoner saw his wife and heard the charge which was made against him he has scarcely spoken a word to any person, save when calliung for food, which he partakes of with a good appetite. He remained nearly the entire of yesterday in one position, with his head resting on his hand, and apparently impressed with the fearful character of the charge brought against him. The Crown Solicitor and Mr. Superintendent Guy were occupied during the principal part of the day in taking down the statement of Mrs Spollen and those of her daughter Julia, a very clever and mtelligent ohild, who appears to ho about 11 or 12 years of age, and in charge of the police, along with her mother, as a witness for the Crown. " The razor with which Mr. Little's throat is supposed to have been out, and which was found by the police in the canal, was shown to Mrs. Spollean yesterday for the purpose of trying whether she could identify it as one belonging to her husband. She said that she could not recognize it as his, but remarked that some time before the murder was committed her husband had been made a present of a razor by a friend of his, and that the razor found in the canal may bethat one. The police are aware of the name and address of the person who gave the razor to the prisoner, who no doubt will be able to saypositively whether the razor in the hands of the police is the one which he gave to Spollen. In the information gIven by Mrs. Spollen to the police she says that ' her husband, on comin home at 8 o'clock on the evening of the murder, remembered that he had forgotten his ' time-book' in the office of Mr. Little, and, fearing that might be discovered, he went baek to the room and found it there, and brounght it home.' The little girl (Julia Spollen) in her examination yesterday, it is understood, gave some very important information, and identifies the ptece of cotton cloth in which the money found by Sergeant Meyers on Wednesday last between the boundary walls of the rsailway and the workhouse was wrapped up as hers, This piece of cloth, she says, she got from her aunt some time since to make a bonnet, but, not liking the material, it was never applied to the purpose for which it was given, but left lying at home. A general search for the remainder of the money taken from Mr. Little's office on the night of the murder and also for the key of the office-door was resumed yesterday morning by Sergeants Craven and Meyers, assisted by a number of workmen. The Bradogue river, into which it is stated the key was thrown, was thoroughly explored for a considerable distance, and in places where it was flged over the flagging has been removed to facilitate the search. The two hiding places where the money was found concealed on Wednesday were also minutely examined, but up to a late hour last evening neither the key nor the remainder of the missing money had been discovered. A fitter's hammer, with a broken face, was found in a drawer in the prisoner's house. This hammer is the one which was given to the prisoner out of the railway stores when he stated some time since that he had lost his own. The hammer which the prisoner stated that he had lost, Mrs. Spollen says, is the one which was found in the canal, Late yesterday evening the cottage in which the prisoner resided was searched in every part, but no discovery was made. The son of the prisoner, whose name is also James Spollen, who is at present in charge of the police at Chancery-lane stationhouse, is a well-looking lad of about 16 years of age. He bore his confinement very weU up to yesterday evening, when he became quite overpowered with grief at the position in which his father was placed, and called repeatediy for his mother, and he begged of the constable who had charge of him to take him to her or bring her to him. He is at present detained by theCrown as a witness. The search at the Broadstone terminus will be resumed this day, and the further exploration of the river proceeded with, as the possession of the missing key of the door of the cash-office is regarded as of the last importance. " Spollen was originally employed by the company in the capacity of a porter, but, being an intelligent, quick, ingenious person, he soon acquired some skill as a painter, and was lItterly engaged, as we have already stated, in painting, glazing, and occasionally doing odd jobs about the terminus ; in fact, he was regarded as a very useful, ' handy man,' especially in the painting and varnishing department. He is described as a very indstrions, hardworking man, rather quietin manner, steadyin conduct, of good address, and one of the last peraons to whom suspicion was likely to attach. The cottage lies almost exactly opposite to the room in which the murder was committed, and is within a stone's throw both of the terminus and of the ulace where the murderer concealed his booty. Thus the hrst object which would meet the eyes of Spollen and his wife on going onu of their cottage was the window of Mr. Little's room; and the recollection of the terrible tragedy enacted therein being constantly kept before the mind of the woman may have contributed with other causes to induce her to make the important disclosures which have resulted in the discovery of the money. The cottage is at present in the occupation of the police, and the only - members of tho prisoner's family remaining in it yesterday were his two younger children; his second son, an intelligent boy, about 13 years of age, and another about foar or five years old. The elder of the two appeared to feel th ) position of his father and the sudden breaking up of th i family; but the younger, as might be expected from his youth moved about apparently unconscious of calamity, though somewhat embarrassed and surprised at the preseuce of the police. " We understand that the prisoner, contrary to what might have been expected, has never evinced the slightest disinclination toenterinto conversation onthe subject of the murder. He has frequently discussed the matter with various persons in tho employment of the company, alhvav expressed his horror of the crime, and was noticed for constantly observing, ' What a nerve the fellow must have had that did it.' It is stated that a few days ago he was in company with some of the workmen, when, the murder having been referred to, one of the men remarked, 'I wonder whether the murderer was among the batch lately discharged by the company.' 'No,' replied Spollen, I I am certain tho fellow is stiU among us and laughing at us.' In reference to the question. of unrestricted access to the terminus it may be mentioned that the prisoner had charge, among other matters relating to the bulding, of the cleaning of the windows, on which account his passing through rooms and corridors woald not attract particular notice. "Amnong the means resorted to shortly after the crime was committed for assisting to discover the murderer was clairvoyance, and at the same there was forwarded to the police authorities from England a etatement, alleged tohave been made by a clairvoyant operated upon in the usual way, that the murderer's name was ' Pollen,' or a similar name, and that he lived in a ' cottage near the railway.' The clairvoyant was aboy employed in a factory in London, and the foreman of the establishmnent, who forwarded the communication to the police here, mentioned that the boy's powers in this respect had bean frequently tested and found useful. "Although no time has yet been fixed forbringing up the prioner for e-amination at Capel-street office, in all probablilty the case for the Crowvn will he Eo far complete as to enable the police to charge the prisoner before the sitting magistrate in the course of this day." Another morning paper states that an investigation by the Crown solicitor was held at SackviUeplace station late yesterday evening, and that some fresh evidence was elicited, which, however, it was not deemed prudent to make public. It is also stated that Spollen is an Irishman and a member of the Roman Catholic church. He is a native of Lucan, a village about six miles distant from Dublin on the west side. Mrs. Spollen, it appears, has made some further revelations:- "On the night of the murder she states that her husband did nob immediately bring the money into the house, but concealed it among some sheds near his own residence, until he had broken the mattr to her. Afterwards he brought it in a tin vessel, counted, and divided it into a heap of silver and a heap of gold. The latter and a portion of the former he consigned to the places in whict they were found during the sanie night. A large part of the silver, however, he con cealed in a small tank adjoining his residence ; and two days before the discovery of the money in the hasket, near the carriage works, it was taken by him at 6 o'clock in the morning, and placed in that position. She alleges that he did this knowing that the basket had been lying unused for two years, and tbat, baving access to the premises at aU times, he could, with almost perfec5 security, draw froli it smal sums from time to time for his private purposes. She also says that he was in great terror at one period, when the police were actually searching within a few feet of the place in which the gold was coacealed, and that she, believing it was discovered, warned hisa of the circumstance, whereupon he wiade a pretence to clean some lamps along the wall, which gave him an opportunity of overlooking the proceedings of the police without suspicion attaching to himself, and she added that he told her the gold was not discovered, as the stones renimined where he had placed them. Some corroboration of this fact is afforded by the circumstance that the police actuaUy searched upon one occasion within two feet of the hidiug-places both of the gold and the silver." THE FPDS.

The son of the prisoner and another person were examined, and their statements takeft down in writing in the shape of depositions. Shortly before 4 0'clock the prisoner was placed in a cab, and, accomDanied by Superintendent Guy,was on hiS way from Fredericklane atation to the Police-court in Capel-street, where the magistrate?, Mr. O'Donnell and Mr. Porter, had remained after office hours for the pur. pose9 of hearing the case; on the way, however, an order was received from the Government authorities countermanding a previous order, and directing that the prisbner shou.ild not be brought before the mag'strates for examination antil to-morrow mornmg~ at 1l o'clock. The interest evinced by the Executive in the progress of the case may ~be gleaned from the fact that anAide-de-camp of the Lord- IZeutenant attended to watch the proceedings. The greatest excitement prevailed in the neighbourhood of the Polce-court, where crowds of persons were assembled. No new fact transpired during the day.
TRE ART TREASURES EXHIBITION. The admissons on Thursday, the half-crown day, showred a slight falling off. The returns were,-Admitted byr season tickets, 3,620; on payment, S,206; total, 6,826. Of these 2,048 arrived by railway.

Jeffery, Reay, Evans, &c. At a quarter-past 1 o'clock they were joined by Mr. Scharf, who was kind enough to point out the principal objects of interest in the Gallery of Ancient MAasters, and subsequently 3Ir. Chaffers went through the great central haU with the society, and pointed out the contributions of antiquarian interest. Mr. Crossley, of Maachester,acted as the able cieerone of the visitors to the gallery of British celebrities, and his accurate knowledge of the histories of the most celebrated characters and a fund of anecdote at his command connected with many of them, enabled him to give great interest to this portion of the day's sojourn in the Art Treasures Palace. The members afterwards dined together In one of the refreshment saloons,where Mr. Donald'sgenius in providing for the com. forts of his guests was displayed to great advantage, and appeared to give the highest satisfaction. Some of the members of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers again visited the Art Treasures Exhibition yes. terday, after witnessing some interesting experiments with the rilled field piece invented by Mr. Joseph Whitworth, at the Firs. Mr. J. C. Deane has fitted up an ante-room to the private apartment in which Her Majesty Is to be received, which is handsomely furnished with tapestries, armoury, and stanuary. The whole arrangements are all that could be desired or taste and elegance.

The distance was from tho island to the bridge, against the stream in all the races, and Mr. F. Playford, former champion of the Thames, kindly officiated as umpire. The race was one of the finest on record. The whole three were started strictly in a line, and continued oar and oar nearly half the way to Poplar Point, where the Henley men fell a little short and then the Londoners. The London then took the Henley men's water, but the Oxford men continued their coinse rnot coming across till between Poplar Point and Remenham-lodge, when they took the London men's water, and came down to the bridge three lengths in advance, there being nearly the same distance between the second and third. It was very capitally rowed, THE STEWARD' OH&LLE GE CUP. London .. .T tte London Rowing Club.. .. .. , I Cambridge.. .. TheLadyMgaretClub .. .. .. .. 0 1AIr. T. Seeker, steerer. This was a great sporting event, the London men being favourites. Crowds of persons rushed to the end of the meadows on the Berks side to get the best view of the start. Thei were off like lightning, and close together for 300 yards when the winners began to lead, and, although the Cambridge men rowed at a clipping pace, they were unable to overhaul them.
