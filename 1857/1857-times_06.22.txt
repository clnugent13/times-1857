MONEY-AfARKHTandOITY.TNTELZ;IGENOZ Saturday Evening. The English funds have beeninactive to-day from want of business, but, owing to the favourablo character of the Bank return, and the announcement that the 1,125,0001. due to Denmark is not likely to be vwithdravn, the tendency was towards improvement. Consols for the 9th of July were quoted 93t to ex. dividend, and the last official quotation was 93t to i. After regular hours there was rather less firmness. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 924 to 93; New Three per Cents., 93 to *; India Bonds, 8s. to 4s. discount; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to 4; and Exchequer-bills, 3s. discount to Is. premium. Foreign securities were steady, with a moderate amount of business. In Turkish Six per Cents. operations took place at 96g. Buenos Ayres, for account, were negotiated at 87 ; Ecuador New Consolidated, i4; Provisional Land Warrant, 3i; New Granada Active, 22i; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for account, 77,; the Three per Cents., for the account, 54; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 99; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97*. The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 40c. for money, and 68f. 60c. for the end of the month, showing a further fractional decline. The letters from Paris continue to describe complete discouragement on the Bourse, although during the past week the demand for money in the discount-market has greatly diminished. The specie of the Bank of France is believed to be well mantained, notwithstanding the drain to Italy which is still observable. The recent reduction in the premium offered for gold will, it is considered, prevent any new contracts being effected for supplies from this country. Uncertainty seems to prevail as to the question of a reductioa of the rate of discount. The more cautious bankers express a hope that it may be deferred till next month, when money is usually in less demand, but the majority of the public evidently expeet it to take place on Thursday next. The railway meetings of the week have not proved important. The shareholders of the LIanidloes and Newtown Company have passed resolutions authorizing the construction of a railway from Caersws to Machynlleth, and powers were given to the new company to use the Ilanidloes line from Caeraws to Newtown, and for both companies to enter into traffic and station arrangements. The Shrewsbury and Welshpool shareholders have approved the Bill for the line from the Ilanidloes and Newtown Railway to Machynlleth. The shareholders of the Great North of Sotland Company have agreed to the several Bills before Parliament, including that for extending the Banff, Macduff, and Turriff Junction Railway from Turriff to Banff and Maeduff. By this arrangement there will be direct communication between Aberdeen and Banff. There have been no Australian gold arrivals this week, but the Francis Henty, with 100,000., is now 92 days out. The Champion of the Seas, with 131,0001., and thbRoxburgh Castle, with 122,0001., have been out 75 and 77 days. The next telegraphic despatches from India and China are expected about the 27th of June. The present is a slow vessel, however, and it may be delayed to the 29th. The subjoined communication urges the claims cf the various enterprises for furnishina the Ottoman empire with those facilities of com3munication n which, notwithstanding the natural extent of h r commerce and her liberal tariff, Turkey is behind all other nations of eaual rank. Still, however inVIingmay be the field offered, there can be little doubt that, although during the past two years no actual progress has been made, the capital of this country will henceforth, if the money-market should return to its ordinary state, be attracted to that region to an extent which will ca rather for check than acceleration. For the interest of Turkey herself the progress of such undertakings should be gradual, and it is to be hopedshe will henceforth show reserve in entertaining them. Should she wait to see the result of the concessions thus far granted, it is possible that, instead of having to solicit capital in future eases by offering guarantees, she may find an eager competition for the privilege of undertaking great works even withoat them. The concession to the Euphrates line will be sufficient to test the effect of railways in stimulating the industry of the Syrian portion of her territory, where, according to the reports from British Consuls and others lately published by the Board of Trade, only these are required to make that region again the ganary of the world, while it wil also, as a new ghway to India, draw still closer her political relations with England. The Smyrna line will perform a similar service as regards Asia Minor, by showing the effect of adopting economical means of transport to a port the aggregate trade of 'which is estimated to amount annually to 5,000,000!., of which about a third is direct with this country. Finally, the Kostendje route to connect the Danube with the Black Sea, so as to save between 200 and 300 miles in transporting the produce of Servia, Bulgaria, and Wallachia, will suffice as an experiment for that district. These several works will confer equal benefit on each of the three most important portions of the empire. When they shaU have been completed, but not before, it will be time to think of new ones. With the present rapidity of operations a couple of years will enable their most important portions to be constructed, so that the public may be satisfied of their prospects, and the Turkish Government would best consult their own welfare and dignity were they to intimate that until after the lapse of that period no new applications for guarantees on schemes of any magnitude will be taken into consideration:- " Sir.-In relation to the connexion of this country with the Turkish empire The Tines correspondent at Constantinople in his letter of the 5th inst., men. tions that little has as yet been done by his countrymen to hasten the new projects for developing its commercial capabilities. He applauds the willingness of the Tarks to facilitate by every meaos in their power Western enterprise, but omits to state that this temporary inactivity has solely arisen from the late stringent state of the money-markets. The eagerness of the Sultan's subjects to avail themselves of every improvement was not, hemaever. affected by such a distant cause, and they have, per. haps unwisely, forced on many projects in which delay vouldthavenbeen not only a great cause of acceleration but would have proved an actual advantage to Turkish credit. "No little advance has, nevertheless, been made. The Euphrates Valley Railway and telegraph are becoeing more and more matters of publio interest. The prassova and postendje concession is n the bands of a most power. ful combination, who are determined (sufficent capital being already subscribed) to push on the wrorks w ith the greatest speed. "aThe Smyrna and Aidin Company, first in the field, still maintains its position, and the fact of tenders having besn ofalrad iitheotep l Trihet esilfniswa at intis d for the construction o the entire line proves thatirnwths wcase, at least, there will be no failure. thne native capitalists, too, have given the strongest proofs of their earnestness, for in the lastr-namd under. taking a third, at the least, of the entire capital of the company rs taken up in Turkey. Indeed, I venture to pre. dict that in a few years the residue of the stock of this and of all the other purely Turkish enterprises will find its way at high priecs to and be held by local proprietors. "Riwags will be but a sink for British capital, unless there is traffic suficient to realize a large dividenld; let us therefore look at the trade that at present exists. '"I extract the following figures from the Board of Tr,.de returns of our exports for the first quarter of the present L Britisb po eston .. . ..,2C0.000 2. United States 6.300Q 3. aEan" Towns .3a00c 4. Franc , , . 1,6000 5. Ottoman Empire .1 1618C00 " The Ottoman empire is thus fifth in rank among our customers. It absorbs within a few thousands as much of our exports as France, and, if present progress be sustained, will immediately take her place. Can anything be more satisfactory than this return, which shows imports from this country alone at the rate of 6,500,000k per annum ? "Now letus turn to the local business of one of the Turkish ports. Take Smyrna, the capital of the Levant. I find from the statistical tables published annuaUy by M. Zallomi, the Austrian Consul at thatplace, that the following correctly represents the value of its exports and imports for the past year:- Impots. Exports.

" Turkey, with its climat, itg unrivallod seaboard, and 6 soil the fertility of which onee sapported the teeming populations of vast ann numerons cities, has novr, with the exception of the Danube, neither roads, rivers, nor canas;3 but, once let the zailways afford adequate mesas of trans' port and everg vaUey will exchange its surplu3 produce for British a nd co ntl nental go ods,. " I am, Sir, your obedient servant, At the first ordinary meeting of the Australian Auxiliary Steam Clipper Company, Mr. J. Gillespie in the chair, the report, detailing progress, waa adopted. It wva announced that it is not at present proposed to take the question of dividend into consideration, as, although the earnings of the Istanb^oul have been satisfactory, it is thought only prudent to await the return of the other three ahips. At the termination of the proceedings Messrs Harding and Pullein were appointed publicauditors Subjoined is an abstract of the report. "T The directors have the pleasure to submit to the shareholders an accoumnt of their progress, and to congrattlate them upon the success which has hitherto attended their exertions. The fleet of the company is at present confined to the four following sailng clippers with auxiliary stam power-viz., the Istanboul, 1,470 tons 0. iL, 100-horse power; the Indomitable, 1,160 tons o. m., 8-horse power; the King Phllip, 1,391 tons o. in., 60-horse power, and the Undaunted, 1,448 tons o. m., 100-horse power. These vessels, of the aggregate value of 130,000L., were purchased or; the valuation of iessrs. Bayley and Bidley, surveyors and valuers to the company. All these vessels have already been despatched to Melbourne punctnally with satis. factory cargoes of merchandise and passengers, the rate of freight averaging an amount considerably in excess of that obtainod by sailing vessels. The directors have to aunounce that their first vessel, the Istanboul, which sailed from Plymouth on the 16th of November last, arrived out at Melbourne, though deeply laden, drawing 22, feet water, in 71 days, having been 14A days under steam, and consuming only 210 tons of coal. She left Melbourne on the 3d of March, with afull cargo ofgoods and passengers, and arrived at Plymouth In 79 days, overtaking all the vessels which sailed a month previously-viz, the South Carolina, which sailed on the 3d of February; the Sydenhan, on the 10thof February; the Morning Star, on th o 2th of February- the Medway, on the 17th of Februar7; and the DonJad M'KAy, on the 26th of February The entire success of the principle advocated by this company having been eo far established by the performanoes of the Istanboul, the seeed with which the company'a vessels have been loaded, an the desire expressed bythe merchants in tne Australian trade for the departure of a vessel from each end punctually on a given day on eech month, point to the advisability of an increase of the company's fleet. The directorshave reason to expect a good revenue fromithe shipment of gold by their vessels from the fact of the banks and goldship rs aving alrsedy shown a Preference in favoar of the stanboul, which brought 45,000 ounces, valce 180,0001., an amount considerably in excess of that brought by any of the sailing vessels leaving at the same period. The directors may here remark that the general rates of freight at the time of the Undaunted's being ready for sea were found so low that they determined to tender the vessel for emigrants, and had the satisfaction of finding a decided preference given to her by the Emigration Commissioners, and also at once getting her fixed .with a remunerative charter. The director. think it necessary to allude to the suspension of Mr. Robert J. Brown, and his consequent retirenent from the direction. The board have secured the completion of the Undaunted in the terms of the original contract, and they have no reason to apprehend any loss to the company upon this account." The audit of the accounts of the Agra and United Service Bank, taken on behalf of the new directors who have recently joined the bank on the establishment of its head-quarters in London, has been completed under the supervisiou of a professional accountant, and is stated to have been of the most complete description. The annexed information relative to the progress of English mining adventure is condensed from the Mining Jounl:- " There has been little activity in the share-market, and prices, where shares have been offered for sale, have with few exceptions declined.

ORDINARY SHARES AND HTOOKR
ADnVTuRm OF LADY FRAxK&s BOAT.-Aboutr 14 months ago Mr. Ounard, of Canard, Munn, and Co, Liverpool, sold by auction the Sir John Franklin expeditionary steamer Isabd, the conditions of sale withdrawingf from tho transaction a small mahogany-built ice boat, laic down years ago under the instructions of Sir John Franklim himself, which accompanied the last expedition, and waswith the party who found the Franklin relics, and whiclx was much prized on these accounts by Lady Franklin. That boat wvas not included in the sale, bat by some oitsstiom it remained on board the Isabel, and was taken away hPi*e, purchaser of that vessel, and ultimately all clue to the mat was lost. In the meantime Lady FranMin, with a devo. tion unparalleled, embarks the remnant of her fortune i. a final expedition in search of her husband, and directs. that this favourite boat, of the absence of which she bas. not been made aware, shall again take part in the explora. tions. Another effort to find it was ordered to be made. The matter was placed in the hands of Inspector Bates, of Iaverpool, who, after many searching inauirles, obtains information from an old fisherman which leads him, acoompanied by Mr. Johnson, a person who can identify the- 'issing boat, to a place called Llananheiran. about sever.. miles inland on the Welsh coast, and about 16 miles frot,. Carnarvon. Therm, in an enclosure somethiDz like a pi.- fold, and covered with dirt and filth, they find the littlea boat in the possession of a landsman who hid been leftir charge, but who, on hearing the case explained, made no. attempt to resist the servants of the law. A cart was pro. cured, and the boat was taken to Menai brid where i. wasahipped in the next steamer for Liverpoolat whicik latter place it arrived on Wednesday, and was on Thura forwarded by train to Aberdeen, where it arrived in time to join the expedition.

CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. The auxiliary acrew mail steamship Scotland 4Captain G. Atkins, arrived at Dartmouth oa Satur'day afternoon. Her dates arcCalcutta, MIarch 15. 2Madras, March 22; Point de Galle, M'arch 28 -the 3iMauritius, April 11; Cape, April 29; St. HIelena, 3tlay 10; and Fayal, June 7. She brings ageneral cargo of Calcutta and Cape produce and 35 passen:gers. The Cape Parliament was opened on the '7th of -April by Sir George Grey. He recommended Pargiament at an early period of the session to deterumine In what manner provision should be made for ,ultimately raising the funds which will be required ffor the construction of a harbour of refuge in Table :3ay. The question of European immigration was also rorought to the especial notice of the Legislature. Ilis Excellenec expressed his satisfaction at the conduct and appearance of the German Legion. The revenue, which was estimated last year at *something less than 305,0001., is estimated for the .current year at nearly 387,0001. This advance of -upwards of 80,0001., he mainly attributed to the Tapid increase which is taking place in the amount -of exports and to the consequently increasing -commerce and, trade. The prosperous state of the cfinances of the colony will enable the Government -to provide the contribution which this colonv is to pay towards the expenses of bringing out the Anglo-German Legion from the ordinary revenue, without raising any loan for the purpose, as was at one time expected. " the great increase in the ecommercial prosperity, which began to develope itself in the year 1855, still continues. In the year i854 the value of exports was 606,0004; in the wear 1856 that value had nearly doubled itself, havisgrisen to 1,240,62e1. Tbe quantity of wool -exported during the year 185 was 8, 67,4571b.; in 3856 the exports of wool had also nearly doubled, baying risen to about 15,000,0001b." Z In his speech the Governor sketched the policy he had pursued with respect to the Caffres on the bor-ders. At the conclusion of the last war, he said, the <affres were inforrned that they were to be governed in future according to Caffre laws and usages, and f4hat the British Government could not entertain -any appeal against the oppression of their chiefs. 'This system his Excellency condemned, as " legal-zing the indulgence of the chiefs and great people in every vice of which the most depraved nature is .apable, and subjecting a whole nation to the worst and most degrading tyranny and oppression upon -the part of a few. It would prevent, he) said, hopelessly,the introduction of civilization and Christiamty into the country, and would permit a few vicious, ill-disposed chiefs to defeat with certainty the amanifold attempts which were being made on so .great a scale for the improvement and social advancement of their race; while to assist in the zadministration of such laws was not to rule, but to be the servant of vicious barbarians,-to aid the 'fbad in oppressing the good." Alluding to recent eaneasures he said:- " His first step was to locate a European magis-lrate in each district in British Caffraria, adopting a -simple mode of administering justice, which gave a security to life and property such as had never previously been enjoyed in that country. The fines, -which were formerly taken by the chiefs, became a part of the public revenues of the Crown, the chiefs -being paid for the duties they performed bv a fixed atipend provided by the Government. The result of -this was that the influence and authority of the -chiefs soon began to decline, and the well-disposed among the Caffres began to regard the Government -with confidence and hope." Private letters from the frontier, received by the blast post, present a melancholy picture of the distressed state of the Caffres entering the colony for -employment. The Geyser left for East L )ndon on the 29th of April, to bring down two companies of the 89th Regiment for Cape Town. The Vulcan left for England on the 26th, and was at St. Helena on the 5)th of M'ay, taking invalids from the different regi-nents on the frontier. The Penelope is in Table Bay. The following French vessels of war had arrived -on their way to China :-The Phlegeton, Dragonne, Fusee, Durance, La Meurthe, Transport, Avalanche, Primauguet, Mitraille, G6nie, and Nemesis. The mail steamship Clarendon arrived on the 24th -of April. The markets for produce were brisk. Upwards -of 400 bales of wool were sold in Port Elizabeth at a wise of id. per lb. as follows :-The fine fleece-washed -ranged from Is. 4d. to is. 61d. The better price 'was for some wool from Beaufort (West) of superior -quality; fine handwashed ranged from Is. 41d. to Is. bid.; fine unwashed, from 9 d. to ls.; mid'dling washed, from lld. to is. 3id. ; coarse hand- 'washed, Is. Od.; ditto unwashed, 9d. The value -of the wool alone must have been between 5,0001. -and 6,0001., and the other produce could not have -added less than 5001. more to that amount. The -revenue to the market wonld thus be increased by about 601. through that day's sale. A large quantity of goat and sheep skins was also sold at the 'naale, and fetched high rates, goatskins ranging from :3s. Id. to is. 7d., and shoepskins from 2s. 4d. to lOd.; ivory from Gs. 6d. to 7s. 6d., if of good -quality; ostrich feathers from 71. lOs. to 81. per lb.; aloes, 4d. per lb. ; argot, 35s. to 40s. per lOOlb.; horns, from 40s. to 42s. Gd.; Cape brandy, from -301. to 321. per leaguer.
Txr DrRECTORS OF TF1 ROYAL BRITISH BiNK.- T1he directors of the late Royal British Bank already in cnstody or liberated on bail are at present five in number. Mr. Ovwen, Mr. Stapleton, M.P., and Mr. Macleod have put in iail for their appearance; Mr. Humiphrey Brown is at present in the Queen's Bench Prison, not having completed his anil. Mr. Alderman Kennedy is on his way to this counitry, and wil arrive in London to-day in cn4ody of one of the assistants of Inspector Field. Bail is ready to bh Riven to the required amount for h1r. Kennedy. Alderman Ken. nedy was captured in the south of Germany by Inspootor .Fl d. He had for some time past been suffering considerably inhealtb, and was about to leave the residence he had <occupied for some time for one in Italy. The alderman was, it is stated, considerably alarmed on being arrested. Me was at first taken to Wiesbaden, where he was left by -he officer and a member of the firm of Messrs. Linklater and Hackwood, in charge of an assistant, instructed to accompany him to London. bIr. H. D. Macleod, who was -a director of the bank in the earliest stages, surrendered Ihimself at Doulogne on Thursday morning last to Mr. Hosgood, who held the warrant for his apprehension. and in whose com any he arrived iU town on the afternoon of that M Mr. Macleod was subseqliently broughb up before Mr. Fabstice Erle at Judges' Chambers, when the amount of his eZail was fixed at 8,001.-himself 4,0001. and two sureties of 2,0001. each. Mr. Humphrey Brown, it appears, succeeded for some time in evadinig being taken by wearing green spectacles and a wig, which moit effectnUlly altered his parsonal appearance. No proceedings will be taken against Alr. Apsley Pellatt; his connexiou with the concern, and -the acts which he performed having been d ubtless inifaoanced by a feeling of the most perfect confidence in the antegrity of those with whom he was associated. He was in no way benefited by the fraudulent transactions of the loank, and the Attorney-General, feeling convinced that the orosecution of that gentleman would be attended with ifailure, has decided not to take steps against him. The indictments against the parties are for having conspired ifraudulently to obtain a charter from Her Majesty's Privy Council, and also for conspiring to obtain money by frandulent representations. The trials will not, it is expected, come off before November, and they will take place in the Court of Queen's Bench. The BiU to enable the assignees -of the bank to effect a compromise between the shareholders -nd depositors has passed the House of Commons, and now awaits a second reading in the House of Lords. It is stated, 5liowever, that Lord St. Leonard's and some other of the law lords are Opposed to the further rogress of the Bill until he apeal froni the decision of the Master of the Rolls in Ireland respecting the liability of the shareholders of the 2'ipporary Banke has been decided.

A DEN O ShNAKddS.-The great snake den in Emt Martford, Connecticut, beats the entire country. It is on 'ibbe edge of the old Ritter Quarry, and Mr. Ratnsom White, ,who resides in that vicinity, has taken 214 live snakes from Ahat single der. No other baake den in this country has as jet equalled this. He took out the first lot of 92 on the Oth of April, and from day to day, by removing recks and *~di,gyiag, he found additional families, or "balls, ' of them; 1r i appears that the snakes, to the number of 20 or more, 'wind themselves into a ball and remain in that condition' -during the winter. Mlost of the number were black snakes, ainoearing from 3 to 4Ai feet in length, hut among these were three racers, a long slihm snake with a white ring around the ieck, and three little racers not over 3 inches in length, also -seven poisonous adders. There seems to be some difference fin'the appearance of these addezs, some of them having iflatter heads than others and brighter spots on thom. One of them in particular, a largo vicious-looking fellow, flattens *Aimsolf through his entire length, his head being as flat as a * cent. When he is annoyed he tbrows the upper part of his lead back and strikes like a rattlesnake. He is about 3 feet Ilong, his tail tapering off abruptly, the point for about -2 inches being not much larger than a piece of small twine. He is evidently as poisonous as a rattlesnake.

LORD NAPIER AT WASHINGTON. We tak-e the following characteristio account of tho feativities of the English Mission at Washington from the lVew York Rerald:- "'Her Majesty Queen Victoria completed ber 38th year on tbe 24th inat., which it may not be very gallant to state, but Queens must pay Borne penalty for their greatness, and the annual revelation of their age is one of thom. This auspicious event was seized hold of by Lord Napier, the new British Minister at Washington, to inaugurate his sooial advent, and he could hardly have adopted a happier expedient to crown the popularity he has so rapidly acquired. For a week past his intvitations have been flying about Washington, and many an expectant was faull of suevse lest their hopes of sharing in the gay scene might be disappointed. These pleasant missives were distribated with tact and liberality, and when the occasion arrived all the fashionable world of Washington, with a few outside barbarians, were driving from alt directions to the scene of festivity. "H is Excellency the English Envoy has rented the late residence of Governor Fish, which was in quite a shabby state when it came into his hands a few weeks since, but the paperhangers and gilders have been kept busy at work, and the appearance of the mansion on the night of the ball was the wonder of all who remembered its recent. sorry condition. It had a bright, fresh, and jaunty look, and the radiance of numberless lustres and candelabras threw a brlliancy over its aspect that astonished some and delighted all. " By 10 o'clock moat of the company had assembled, and the large and ourious crowd that surrounded the house without had quite a treat in gazing at the showy toilettes and distinguished persons that rapidly lighted from thoir carriages and passed within the glittering precincts. Three large rooms were thrown open to the guests, one of which was used as the ball-room, while a fourth of equal size was reserved as the supper-room. Dancing begass at half-past 10 o'clock, at which time the crowd was at its height. Unusual vivacity seemed to pervade the throDg, whichtmay, in part, be attributed to the unexpectedness of such an entertainment at this dead season of the year, as well as to the splendour of the scene itself, but more still, perhaps, to the unlooked for novelty of assembling once more under the hospitable roof of a British Minister, when only a few months since it was supposed that years might dapse before such an event would probably occur again. Joyousness was on every face, animation in every movement. The ladies were wreathed in smiles, while grim-visaged men looked placid and disposed for enjoyment. It would be too severe a tax on your readers to attempt any detailed enumeration of all the beautiful women and their costly toilets, or the remarkable and distinguished men that shared in the bounteous hospitaities of Napier-house, as it might be very properly called, and yet it were a slight to the thousands who look to your columns for news both grave and gay, not to make some brief mention of those who were more or less ' the observed ef all observers.' It w/ould he hardly less than rudeness not to single out at the start the noble host and his lovely partner for a word of merited compliment Lord Napier has scarcely resided two months in Washing ton, and yet the remark is universal, that he is the most popular Minster England has ever seut us, This unanimous admission does credit to the discernment of the town, for to say nothing of his rare intelligence, which manifests itself in the smallest things, he is the personification of a well-bred gentleman. Unassuming in deportment, refined in manners, gentle in phrase, he is at all times and placesin his own house and elsewhere-courteous, straightforward, distingss6, yet conciliating. On the present occasion he moved noiselessly about, seeldng in every way to promote the hilarity of his guests, flattering some by a pleasant smile of recognition, entertaining others with a lively word of welcome, and not omitting some kindly attention to the humblest of those bidden to the fesat. Should the reader be inclined to regard this hasty portrait as one of studied panegyri, let him, if he be a New Yorker, step forthwith into Brady's famous gallery and contemplate the inimitable hotograph of his Lordship suspended there, and then, be he or she the most superficial of physiognomists, they will be convinced that Lord Napier looks every word I have pronounced him, aye, ' every inch a nobleman.' "Lady Napier is in every respect worthy such a compeer. In person her ladyship is of the medium height, and of symmetrical figure. Her face is handsome, but it is its expression of genuine affability that constitutes its greatest charm. A winning smile of kindness is constantly playing over her fine features, and any one can see it is ihe reflex of the happy disposition within. She received her company on Thursday night with such ready welcome, extending her hand to nearly all, as to captivate every one who approached her. With becoming taste, she was dressed in the simplest attire, that she might not rival the toilets of her lady guests, A rich necklace of diamonds and emeralds was the only ornament she wore. "The diplomatic corps assembled in great force to do honour to their new confrere, and in compliment to the day several of them wore their various orders and decorations. The French Minister, Count Sartiges, was conspicuous from his broad red riband of the Legion of Honour, and the star on his left breast. The count is quiet and subdued in his manners, with a spice of haueour that does very well in an ambassador. His Countess, ci-dcvant Miss Thorndike, was one of the ornaments of the balL She was elegantly attired in blue satin, with white lce flounces. Though somewhat stout for so young a person her claims to beauty are undeniable. Her bust is maguificent, and her face is singularly attractive from its expression of real goodnature. Her bearing, too, is easy and distinguished, and reminds one of a duchess of the Faubourg St. Cermain. " The Russian Minister, the Baron Stoeckel, travelled aU night from New York rather than fail in responding in person to the invitation of the English Minister, which would have been a serious slight, as the ball was in honour of rhe Queen. The peculiar relations, too, that are supposed, on the strength of rumour, to exist between our Government and those of Russia and England in reference to China at this juncture, would have led to all kinds of inference if the Russian Minister had missed the ball. In order to dissipate suspicion and prevent surmise, Baron Stoeckel was unusally animated in his attentions to aU parties, and seemed anxious to do aU in his power to contribute to the 'daCt of the fdte. His charming wife, autrefois Miss Thompson, of Massachusetts, whether from a hint of her diplomatic spouse, or from her own inclination, was exceedingly gay. She danced the whole evening, and was singularly graceful in her movements. She is a taU and well-shaped woman, pleasing expression of face, and delightfaUly unaffected manners. Madame Cramer, the wife of a Secretary of the Russian Legation, attracted mush attention. She is a Russian by birth, but was admired nore for her beauty than that. She wore her hair a la okinonse which enhanced the effect of her striling physi- " The absence of the amiable Minister fromu Prussia, Baron Gerolt, was regretted, but he is now on hi sway to Europe on leave. There were many others of the diplomatio world worthy of remark, but I must turn my attention now to other quarters. " It did credit to the Cabinet that they turned out to a man on this interesting occasion, and, happily for the ball, they brought their wives and daughters with them. The Secretary of State, General Cass, was uot there, and if any one could find fault with this amiable man, he would deserve it now Rie ought to have taken a hint from Baron Stoekel. and shown himself at the house of the English Minister lest quidnuncs might infer a number of absurd things at his absence. Everybody knows he is writing a despatch of some importance to Lord Napier, and in the ticklish state of things existing between the two countries General Cass ought to have imitated Paul Pry, and just 'popped in,' if only for a moment. The truth is, however, that the General carries out his hygienic habits and regaulations with the vigour of the laws of the Medes and the Persians. So careful is he of his health that he wiU not dine out, not even with the President, and I doubt if he would sit up after 10 p.m. were he sure of the nomination in 1860. Twenty years ago, in Paris, at balls at his own splendid house-and he gave no end of them-he would quiety slip off to bed at 10- o'clock as though he dreaded the fate of Cinderella; but, fortunately, he left his amiable wife, three oh arming daughters, and a host of tza,cd4 to supply his place. Verily, he has his reward, for at 75 he has the appearance and vigour, mental and bodily, of a man of 50, and he will go through his career of Secretary of State with the rattle and dash of au impetuous juvenile, but with the caution and sagacity of an experienced veteran. The tall and very gentlemanly Secretary of the Navy, Governor Toucey, was there with his wife, who is nearly as tall, and equaUy distinguished in appearance and demeanour. The genial face of the plump Secretary of the Treasury wore an expression of the heartiest satisfaction. Howell Cobb is a keen-witted and warm-hearted man, and enjoys fine society as much as he oes the contest of politics or the dignities of office. He is nimble in conversation, and always on the qui vive for the calJs of business or relaxation. He is, perhaps, the most popular man of the Cabinet, and Lord Napier holds him in especial regard. His family are still in Georgia. Governor Floyd, the Secretary of War, arrived with military exactness among the earliest guests. He seems cut out to preside over the War-office, from his really martial appearancea and martial air. It is difficult to believe that his vocation is the pen and not the sword. His charming wife accompanied him to this briUliant field of action, and her Revolationary descent makes ample amends for the unmilitary origin of her "nuse. "Allmusthavenoticedatalliman of pleasant, offhand manners, moving to and fro through the rooms with a searching, critical, disputatious countenance, as though its owner had an especial fondness for Gordian knots. This was Judge Black, the Attorney-General, and one of the most awkward customers in a law argument any antagonist could meet with. His wife is a phenomenon, not of beauty only, but of extraordinary youth. IHer daughter is grown up, and it is not easy to say which is the senior of the two. "A very unpretending, sedate, easy sort of a man is the As8istant Secretary of State, Hon. John Appleton, who seemed vastly to enjoy the ball; for serious peoples are often very fond of levities. His eye is remarkably bright and keen, indicating the clearness and sharpness of his mmid, which is further shown in his precise language and distinct enunciation. He is an admirable adjunct to General Cass, who is just the very reverse in his free-and-easy ways to his exact, Ininute, and carefal Assistant-Secretary. Mrs. Appleton is a sprightly and highly-cultivated person, admirably adapted for society, and it is no wonder, therefore, that she seemed quite at home at the ball. Seated comfortably on a sofa in a side room we remarked a stout man, whose complacency seemed quite impregnable. His face and manner displayed a contented repose really enviable, yet his eye peeped out occasionally from its covert and exhibited energy, will, and intelect not unmixed with uncommon cuteness. This was the new Postmaster-Gene. ral, Governor Brown. His wife, a handsome woman, of frank, unaffected bearing, and of a cordial and kindly nature, was promenading about with her eldest daughter by a former marriage, Miss Saunders. This young lady is destined for a Washington beUe. Sprightly and graceful In mannera, quick and pointed in repartee, a face beam- ing with intelligence and sparkling with beauty, higbly cultivated, with every accomplishment, Miss Sswanders canot fail to shine in the sczons of Washington. ' In co?ing my notice of the functionaries of the Gorenment I may not omit a glance at a plesant, joUy-leokiE person, who contemplated the cLae reun4 him I = in the light of an inoffensive jolke that had little interest for him of any kind. This was Mr. Cinyton Assistant-Secretary of the Treasury, and one of the best business men of this important department. The stories told of his detection of the smallest errors in financial atatements are almost fabalons. HIs wife, the mother of a numnerous progeny, was o ne of the 3oungest and prettiest women at- the balL It was observod with surprise that the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Thompson, and his accomplished wife were not anmong Lord Napier's guests, which was much regretted by the noble host. It was rumoured that temporary indisposition had alone prevonted the worthy secretary from joining in this festive gathering. The nephew of the President, and his private secretary, Mr. Buchanan Henry, attended the baL This gentleman's pleasing address and conciliatory disposition have won him already troops of friends, though occupying a post that exposes him to cavil, and which requires tne utmost good termper to meet all the exigencies attached to it. His position, however enviable in some respects, is far from a sinecure, for such is the indefatigable industry of the Presidont that his lucklem secretary is a prisoner in his office from S a m., generally, to 4 and 5 p.m. No wonder, after such taskwork as this, that he looked so happy at the ball. Among the general company therA were many from distinction and talent abundantly entitled to a paFsing remark, but I have already exceeded your limits, and must rapidly pass by many I would fain stop to contemplate. That solemn, formal man, with 8o littlepretension of manner as to remind one of a country parson, is perhaps, without exception, the most learned and accomplished scholar in the country, the Hon.Edward Everett. whata contrastinbearisgand vivacity is the sprightly lady near him, who converses with such incredible fluency and elegance upon all topics alike, whether serious or light-that is his daughter, Mrs. Lieutenant Wise. That neat, spruce-looking person, with such an iutelligent face and brisk movement, is Mr. W. B. heed, the new Commissioner to China, and the ladv he is talking to is unquestionably one of the most elegant persons present, and admitted to be la grainde dame of Washington; her mnassivo black hai- is exquisitely coff; her faultless toilette, ease of manner, wit a certain grace and pliancy of step, all indicate that she is of a Southern clime, while her intelligent remarks smack of Northern culture; she is the vife of tho Hon. J. Slidell, of Louisiana, and a Creole by birth. Decidedly one of the best dressed and most captivating beauties of the ball-room was the lovely daughter of Captain Ingraham, so well known for his bold rescue of the Eungarian Eoezta. A Washington belUe, biFs Markoe, showed in her fioe bearing and bon ton unmistakeable slgns of having inherited from an old stock these rare and attractive traits. One of the greatest favourit-es of Washington society, Mrs. Stout, a daughter of Commodore Anllick, dispensed her gracious smiles and sparkling wit with even more than her usual liberality. The Hon. Reverdy Johnson and his imposing-looking wife thought the occasion worthy of an unusual act of homage, and came dowr from Baltimore in honour of theball. Mostpersonsremarked the smiling face and comfortable air of a stout, pleasant-looking man, who seemed well contented with his lot in life and would doubtless have wondered to hear there wvas auci a thing as disappointment in the world, as he had never met it. This was Mr. Corcoran, the millionnaire, who, out of Government loans and attention to business, has amassed a princely fortune, with an only daughter, a charming girl, to inherit it. Thel mayor of Washington, Mr. Magruder, lone of the best natured of men,ithough a vigilant and effective officer, was at the ball, with his young and pretty wife. Lat on the list I must say aword of a person hosepresenceinLordNapier'shouseexcited nolittlecarlosity which was allthe more increased by the evidentgoodwill exi8ting between the noble host and his well-known guest, the ChevalierWikoff. Onewouldhave thought, after all the dire mishaps that have befaUen the Chevalier at the hands of the Bntishers, from Lord Palmerston down to the redoubted Consul Brown. that he would have recoiled in terror, if not in hostility, from another English diplomatist. But the Chevalier, whatever his faults, has a mixture of philosophy and good nature about him that makes an admirable cement, which will serve again, as before, to rebuild his fortunes. Consequently, instead of harbourilg a puerile resentment against Iis old patron, Lord Palmerston, he cheerfully seized the first occasion to mnake his bow to his representative in Washington. Lord Napier, not in the least dismayed at this unexpected rencontre, inferred with thatsagacity and tact characteristic of the man that the Chevalier's advances were well meant, and that on his own ground he was not a foe to be despised The best understanding has been the result, and I should not at aU wonder if the Chevalier Wikoff should yet receive another invitation ' to dine and sleep' at Broadlands, or, even, miraisle dictu, that vindictive Consul Brown should politely ask him to step into St. Andrea once more, only for the delight of getting him out, which, however, I wyould not advise'the; ex-prisoner to risk. The Chevalier seemed quite at home it Lord Napier's ball, and many who had not seen him before were surprised, it is said, at his quiet demeanour and unaffected conversation. Among the incidents of the evening may be mentioned a quadriUe, danced by the entire diplomatic corps, Lord Napier leading off with Countess Sartiges. A trait of good fellovwshipmay be noticed en pVs=ant, though it escaped the attention of the company. After supper most of the diplomatic corps, ladies and gentlemen, met at the buffet, as though preconcerted, and each, with a glass of champagne in hand, drank to the other's health with a jovial-heartedness which showed that even in the diplomatio world good feeling is not always effaced by form and rival interests. I should not neglect to mention that more than once during the evening a sincere regret was expressed at the absence of one " bright, partioular star" whom a recent melancholy bereavement has compelled to withdraw temporarily from society. I speak of Miss ane. the beautiful and accomplished niece of the President. Her admirable taste and correct feeling were evinced by a well-timed compliment in honour of the day by sending to Lord and Lady Nipier a profusion of choice flowers, who showed their appreciation of this flattering civility by grouping them in Large china vases and setting them apart for the speial admiration of their guests. One of the chief attractions of the evening were the gardens attached to the mansion, which were brilliantly lit up with coloured lamps, that were suspended from the trees and tastefully scattered over the grounds. Constant groups of dancers retired from the heat of the bail-room to the refreshing air without, and while some promenaded about others ensconced themselves under tents orin arbomrs that were improvised for the occasion. It is only just to add tbat the efforts of Lord and Lady Napier to promote the enjoyment of their guests were actively seconded by the courteous attentions of the gentlemen of the Legation present 31r. Russell and Mr. Manley. In trespassing on your columns to such an inordinate length, for the record of this splendid fIte, I have ventured to hope that you would deem the occasion worthy of such a mark, on your part, of courtesy and good will to the new British Minister, Lord Napier, of whose future career far more may he augured than has been the lot of any of his predecessors."

THE MURDEB oN THE HIGH SF.s.-At the Liver- pool Police Court on Saturday Henry Rogers, the captain' Wiliam Miles. the chief mate, and C. B. Seymour, the second mate of the British bark Martha and Jane, of Sunderland, were committed for trial at the assizes, charged with the murder of Andrew Rose, one of the crew of that vesseL The evidence, which was very voluminous, established the facts that during the voyage from Barbadoes to Liverpool the deceased, who was filthy in his habits, and not alvays to be depended upon when wanted on duty, was repeatedly rope's-ended by the prisoners; that they whipped him iith a whip like a hunter's whip, and set a savage dog upon him which tore pieces of flesh from his limbs; that the captain stuffed the deceased'n mouth and nose with excrement; rolled him about the deck in a cask; chained him naked to the deck in the broiling sun; strung him up to the yard-arm by the neck till his tongue lolUed out and he vas blaok in the face - that he died when the ship was approaching Cape Clear and that his naked body was thrown overboard with as little ceremony as if it had been the carcase of a dog. Before he was dead he had horrible sores about his body, caused by the ill-usage. Mr. T. B. Wall, house surgeon of the Northern Hospital, and Dr. Pennington, were of opinion, judging from the evidence, that the deceased dted from exhaustion and debility, produced by the treatment he had received. IMPORTANT TO AGRIcuLTsuRiSTs.-In the Bath County Court. on Friday, the judge (Mr. J. G. Smith), gave judgment in the case " Strauge v. Matthews," which was an action in which the plaintiff. as lessee of turnpike tolls, sought to recover the sum of 2s. for toll of a carriage on wheels, drawn by horses, and bearing a steam-engine, the engine being used for working a machine which, when put in action by the bsteam-engine, thrashed corn, &c. The defendant contended that the engine wa xmt from toli as an im plement of huabwasdvvih tche meaning of the 3d George IV., cap. 126, sec, 32. His lIonounr, in giving judg,ment, quoted Chief Justice iDallas, who, in deciding a similar question, said that an exemption in favour of agriculture ought to be liberally construea, and least of all should a restraint prevail where it vwa to narrowr and repeal a provision which for the public benefit ought to be largely and beneficially construed, He ,(the learned Judge) was of opinion that the engine in question wras exempt from toll, as an implement of husbandry, and judgment was therefore for the plaintiff. |r 1mAT O Rxv, G.

Williams in the chair. Mr. LAURExCE, the solicitor, read the resolutions passed at the last meeting of ehareholders appointing a committee to protect the interests of the preference shareholders. The necessary steps were taken, and counsel on the part of the preference shareholders was heard against the Bill promoted by the directors of the company. But the committee of the House of Commons did not give any weight to the opposition. The only 'witness examined in support of the BIll 'was Mr. Mowatt, the secretary, and he admitted on cross-exanmination, as his private opinion, that the interests of the preference shareholders 3hould be protected, and that the credit of the company required that they should be protected. The committee of the House of Commons thought proper to pass the Bill, but the case would be aubmitted to a committee of the House of Lords. The funds in hand had been expended, and they would require about 201!. more to bring the matter before the House of Lords. After some strong observations from Mr. WiUiams, Mr. Campbell, and other sbareholders, resolutions were passed approving a petition to the House of Lords against the Bill - that those shareholders who were present and had not subscribed to the extent of 5 per cent. of their dividend should subscribe 7 per cent., and those who had alreadysubscribed 5 per cent, to subscribe a further sum of 2A per cent. of their dinidend, to defray the expenses of the opposition in the HIouse oE L ords. The committee were requested to coutinue the opposition to the Bill so far as the funds subscribed would e.xtend. A vote of thanks to the committee concluded the proceedings.

A great extent of grass has been mown this week. but haymakiug has received interruptions from oocasional thunder showers. The upland grass, from the loug continuance of frost In the spring, appears to be a short crop in some districts, and even in the meadows the svwathes do not tumn out so heavy as appearances indurated, If, howtver, the hay should be got up well and a few showers occur, the after crath wi be such as aimost to make up the deficienoy in the first crop.

Reports from the manufacturing districts of South J3bffordshire represent the state of the iron trade as satisfactory. O.ders are in the market at last quarter's prioes, but the first houses, who are in full work, are reluctant to enter into fresh contracts until the decision of the preliinary meeting of tho trade, which will be held in the courseof tlze next week. The high rates exacted for best mine pigp, notwithstanding the immense make, shows a corresponding increase in the produce of manufactured iron. The coal trade continues active. Ironstone and limestoner remain firm, with a tendericy towards an advanoe. The demands of the furnaces for all descriptions of materials are very great. The chief foundries of the town and distriet are fairly employed, although at the present time there are few workts of great magnitude on hand. At WiUlenhall, Dudley, Wedt Bromwiceh, and WVednesburythe hands are upon fullftime, and the wrought nailerxs of these neigbhoourhoods particularly busy. This branch of manufacture is scarcely ever remembered to have been so active. The manufacturers of metal ware6 in Birmingham, int consequence of the late reductions in the prioe of copper and tin, are more busily engaged than they were a fortngtst ago- but stol sme branches upon which the fall bas no£ yet hxd time to operate are languid and doing little. The prevailing opinion that present rates are likely to be malotained has induFced some manufacturers of general braziert goods to purchasorsther extensively for the autumn andwinter trade; and the workshops are consequently likely to be better employed for some time to come. From the demands of Northern Europe during the war a great increase in oertain branches was anticipated on the return of peace, but these expectations have not been realized. The tin manufacture is brisk. Even during the fluctuations which took place some months back in the prices of blocks, &o., the makers of best wares were busy, and now prices have become essier orders are more numerous than before. From Wolverhampton the reports with respect to the condition of this branch of manufacture are equaUy satisfactory. The conclision of the midsummer quatter is ulsuaUy marked by dulness in the general ironmongery businesses. Accounts are in course of settlement, and commerciat travellers have returned, or are returning, from their journeya. It fortunately happens, however, that this summer the fall in the price of metals has tended to some extent to relieve trades from their otherwise usual inactivity, and promises renewel briskness in the factors' warehouses so soon as midsummer shall have turned. For ornamental and luxurious articles of Birmingham trodactlon, there is at present a considerable call. Tte papier mache and jewelry trades are active, and a great trade is doing in agricultural implements and garden tools of alldescriptious. The exports of Birmingham manufactures to the Eat Indies and South America are represented by some of the Iagest houses in the town as greatly on the increase. The Indian railways cause coxsiderable demands for machinery andforeveryarticle of hardwarconuected with the construction of railways. In addition to the heavy contracts now on hand for the building of carriages and tracks raquired for the continent of India the shipment of fittings of every description is great beyond expectation. NOTTINGHA Jlm 20. There has been a little more doing this week, more particularly in low-priced black and white siUk edgings. The demand also continues for coarse plain goods. Some continental buyers are in the market, some of whom are operating to a fair extent. The Americans are also buying The high price of materials and the state of the money-market have been for some time felt serious drawbacks, and the former obliges manufacturers to be exceedingly cautious hov they produce goods, as creating stock at tbe present high price of s would be very unwise. In hosiery the trade continues very afat. This dulness has now continued for some time, and most branches of this manufactulre are inactive. Yarns and silk continue very dear. LEICESTElR, TuJx 20. There is a tolerable business doing in fancy hosiery; the sock and glove branches are also active. The plain worstedt hcsiery branch is exceedingly dnll, and, indeed, has been for some time past. The domand for cotton goods, which has now for sometime been buoyant, is decreasing. Thereisno> alteration in the price of worsted yarns, and spinners are yet producing cautiously. In wools there is not mucbh doing. The hosiery trade is flat, both at Loughborough ancl IIinckley. LEEDS, Ju--E 20. Continued caution on the part of both merchants and. manufacturers and an absence of briskness in any department of the basiness are the principal characteristics of the woollen cloth trade of this district at the present time. A quiet tone has prevailed in the warehouses this week. The present season's demand for the home market has evidentlynearly ran out, while the preparations for the fall trade are not yet in full operation. Tho peculiar aspect of the wool-market undoubtedly tends to check business. The buyers who have been down during the last few days have only pchased sparingly, bat some of the shipping houses have been rather busy, especially those in the Eastern trade. In the cloth.halls this morning an improved feeling was manifested. There was a considerable attendance of buyers, and a tolerably fair business was trmsacted, chiefly in mixtures and autumn and winter goods. In wool there his been more doing, and prices may be quoted decidedly firmer. It seems very probable, indeed, that the value of the raw material will increase rather than otherwise. At the York wool-market on Thursday there was a large show of wool, batween 700 and 800 sheets. There was a nutaerous attendance of farmers and wool dealers, the former of whom stood out for higher prices, and higher prices were given for nearly all descriptions, especially' samples of the best quality, which realized from 3t. to 21s. and even as much as 22s. per stone. Bayers held out against the highest rates for some time, but eventually they gave way, and nearly all, If not all, the wool exhibited was sold. At Selby an average supply of wool was shown, which was bought up at from 20s. to 21s. 6d. per stone. At Ponte. fract, being the last market for the season, there was not much doing, the clip of the neighbourhood having been chiefly sold at former markets. There were only about 55 sheets shown, and prices ruled about the same as last week HALIFAX, Jujir 20. There have been more inquiries and more business done in the yarn trade since our last report, although trade still remains without animation. A little more has also been done in piece goods. In the long wool-marke6 there has been a fair amount of sales in proportion to the quantity arriving, nd quotations of aU kinds are fully as firm. Some sots, indeed, are rather dearer. Short wool and noihe are scarce, easy to selL and command good rates. To-day's market has been pretty steady and satisfactory. BRADFORD, JuiNx 20. The worsted piece trade manifests a steady improvement. The buyers in attendance are more numerous than for several weeks past, and the inquiries for manufactured goods are to a satisfactory extent; a fair business is transacted in the lighter decriptions at much e same prices as those recently obtained. Gradually a larger proportion of looms is again being brought into operation, as the curtailment of production genernlly adopted in this district for some length of timse, consequent on the unprofitable rates current, has reduced stocks in the warehouses to a comparatively narrow limit. The greater portion of the orders reo ived are for the export trade. Worsted yarns for export meet with a better inquiry, anti more business is doing in some of the shipping houses, while the firmness of prices has decisively augmented. In the home department comparatively restricted contracts are entered upon. The spinners still keep a large number of frames unemployed, as the only course whereby to obtain the more remnnerative figures the cost of production absolutely compels them to demand. Cotton warps exhibit ana increased firmness, consequent on the enhanced rates obtainable for the raw material in the Lancashire markets; orders, compared with last week, are more numerous. The wool-market participates in a better tone with the otber departments of our trade, and a slight improvement is perceptible from its inanimate condition last noted. In combing descriptions there is rather more activity, and to Furply the imperative requirements of the trade larger and more numerous dealings are reported. Prices generally are decidedly 6rm, while the best long staple portions of the new clip arriving from the country are bought up with readine.s at 6gures denoting a tendency to advance. The purcbases from the farmers are certainly being made at prices proportionately above those lately current In our market. Short wools and noils, from the scantiness of the supply, are purchased with eagerness, and command full currencies. DUBLIN, Juwz 20. The Customs receipts for the week to Thursday, June 18, inclusive, were 19,4901., against 18,528. last week. BELFAST, JvN'z 19. Linen. -At Armiagh rough broWsS were well bought up ,,t firm rates; lawns neglected. In Lugan. the supply was small; bird-eye diapers bought freely at to prie8, damasks and lawns dull of sale at old rates, yi Bally. mena, on Saturday, there was a lifeless trade, with drooping prices. Linen Yarn.-The demand this week quiet, but pzices keep firm. Flax.-The supply of flax in the different conntry markets this week was fair, considering tbe lateness of the season, with a brisk demand for all kinds at la week's prices. Cotton.-In the production of gray goods the local houses are more actively employed, and are quiet; the trade shows a healthy spirit. Printing 'aoonets and tape checks sell pretty freely. Lawns of reeds are aull.
TRADE STRIKESAhT LivnRpoo.-The cabinet- makers and stonemasonsof Liverpool are in the fourtk week of their strike for au advance of wages, and there appears to be no present prospect of an arrangement. The stone work at several large piles of extensive and splendid offices in the neighbourhood of the Exchange has come to a standstill. greatly to tho inconvenience, in one case, of the I&verpool and Iondor Ivsurarioe Corn y, who purposed taking pos. session of their new off;es bfore the close of the year.

ATLANTIC SuBm1jsAfl TELEGRAPH.-The tedious process of shipping this gigantic coil proceeds daily, and already 98 miles are VwounD in beautiful regularity round the circular hold of the Agamemnon. As the time now yapidly approaches when it must leave this oountry, and, whether successful or not, be for evermore hid from the ayes of men, the greatest anxiety is manifested to inspect the coll, which alone as a grand specimen of manufaoturing ukill is well worth a visit. The day the ehipment com. menced Sir George Grey, Sir Charles Wood, and a distin. guished party of visitors, inoluding the Lords of the Admiralty, were present, and waited to see the first mile ,placed saSfely on board. On Friday and Saturday also the visitors were most numerous, the members of bnth Houses and the representatives of foreign Courts bein alike anxious to survey this long metallio channel of uspeech. The whole of the steam-engines, drums, breaks, anud under-running gear, with all the apparatus necessary to its submergement, will be fixed in the course of n few days, and visitors to the Agamemnon will then ?be able to see at a glance the mode in which the telegraph will be sunk, and the dangers and diffculties which beset the operation. At present the wish to witness the details connected with its manufacture extends to the parent establh.hment-the Gutta Percha Company's works, where the core of the cable is formed and the copper conductor coated and insulated. On Saturday Lord Wynford, Admiral Sir William Parker, with Rear-Admirals Sir Henry Martin, }Fanshawe, Richards, and Martin, with other naval and scientific gentlemen, were at the works to inspect the whole process of coating. A number of experiments were tried, ond fuzees were fred under the canal near the GattaPercha Company's works through a coil of wire 65 miles long.

LONDON, MONDAY, JUNE 22, 17. No one can presume for a moment that France believes in her own institutions. There exists at present across the Channel a Constitution as clearly defined and as elaborate as our own. At the head of the Administration is an EmPERoi elected by universal suffrage, the guardian of the laws, the supporter of order, the chief of the forces by land and sea. This Sovereign is assisted by a Council of State, who prepare laws and advise on the execution of them. Then there is a Senate, composed of the most distinguished men of the country-the Marshals, the Admirals, the Cardinals, and other high dignitaries. Lastly comes the Representative Body, chosen by the people on the very broadest basis. Surely here is a Constitution which ought to mean something, and to give some guarantees for liberty. And yet it is but a name, a delusion, the shadow of a shade. There is the EmPErOR firm in his seat, and the army steady in its allegiance and in its hatred of the Parisian mob. These make the Government-everything else is but a fiction more or less serious; and yet it would appear that despotism must pay a certain homage to the shade of departed freedom. In this age even absolute authority must have its decencies. The Constitution of 1852 must occasionally be brought into action, not to attain any definite end, not to satisfy any immediate demand, but to prove that the life has not quite departed out of it. For some reason best known to the rulers of France, it is thought convenient that mankind should not place the Government of Paris in the same clags as those of Berlin or Vienna. The French Sovereign must appeal in some degree to 1789 and to the new principles of France, and these are more or less connected with the preservation of democratic forms, however unmeaning and ineffective they have become. Hence the ceremony of a general election. It is a superstition of the dynasty. The appeal to the entire people is part of the Napoleonian idea-something to be kept up in form, however it may be influenced and perverted. :Every one feels naturally disposed to ask why these elections take place at ail. The EM1PEROp had a Legislature as quiet and subservient as he could possibly wish; why did he not keep it? True, its term had expired according to the Constitution; but what is the Constitution but the offspring of his own will, a form of government which he established, and which he may change ? Surely the planner of the coup dNetat cannot be scrupulous as to the rights of representative a3semblies. Why this wondrous devotion to legality, so strangely contrasted with the cavalier proceedings of Prefects all through the country ? Here is a Government which, on the eve of an election of the people's representatives, prepares its own list of candidates, enforces the choice of them by official articles, by a vast organization of functionaries, by mnaking known its intention to grant licenses, pririleges, and places only to those who support it; which " warns" one of the most popular newspapers in France for recommending the claims of Opposition candidates; which, in fact, openly asserts its right to control the choice of the people, and practicaly to nominate the representatives, and yet this same Government will not go one little step further to save itself all this trouble, vexation, and scandal. An Englishman would certainly think it a much less stretoh of authority for a Parliament to prolong its own existence than for the CRowS to command every county and borough to choose Government members. We cannot at first see any valid reason why a project of law should not have been introduced modifying the Constitution so far as to add another five years to the life of the late Representative Body. It seems, however, that a deference to the principle of universal Buffra.ge, a belief that its occasional exercise, though reaUy without liberty or practical result, gives fresh strength to the Imperial system, is among the most deeply rooted feelings of the present ruler. The success of past trials has naturally tended to strengthen this prepossession. The vote of the people made him President, President for life, and Emperor; it produced the late Assembly, which has proved so obedient and so adulatory; it may well be expected to confirm his I five years' policy by returning at his bidding the same body of men who had before received his approbation. Another reason for this appeal, or pretence of an appeal, is the disquiet which ever affects absolute authority. The very apathy of the French has of late made the Government feverish. It has been terrified at the stillness itself has made. What could be the meaning of this wonderful obedience, this portentou lull in the atmosphere ? Was it the tranquillity which is said to precede the earthquake? It would be a relief to break the silence; even a demonstration or a tumult would be better than the brooding which must be hidden under such an unruffiled surface. It was, no doubt, thought that at this period of prosperity and commercial activity the elections vould pass off quietly. Certainly the Imperial Government is conspicuouw for the success of its policy and the splendour of its fortune. It has since the last election humbled Russia, attached to itself Austria, Prussia, and Sardinia, and established no small influence in Spain. France has been intersected by railways, which are worked with profit to the shareholders and comfort to the public, trade has increased enormously, private life has become luxurious, and private ambition turned into a channel which save3 the State from all the dangers which spring from unruly energies. In fact, the EMPEmOr is powerful and fairly popular, his friends are able to boast his intellect and courage, and his worst enemies confess that his good fortune has been greater than that of any living man. It might naturally be supposed that the former representatives would be again elected, with just sufficient show of opposition to enable the Coart to declare that opinion was not dead in France. Those who were not for the Government were at first unwilling to be against it. The policy of abstaining from voting was recommended to all F who could not conscientiously support a Government candidate. Both Ultramontanes, who hanker after the BounloNs, and Democrats, who look forward to another Republic, were for a time in favour of this course. But of late a change has come over the political world. The newspapers, the liberal circles, the old Constitutional and Republican parties have resolved to Make a demonstration. Of course, these different sets quarrel among themselves by the agency of their respective journals; but still there has beea sufficient unanimity to enable the Liberals of different shades to put forward a threatening list of candidates. Themen of 1848areemergingfromseclnsion, and appear once more on the stage. C&VA1GNAC, BaTMIONT, CARNoTr, GOUDCnuAUX, LASTEThIE, RPYNuA1J, GA&aRN PAGES, JUr.ES S-InON, BASTis, will receive the sufliages of all the discontented of Paris. In the departments several Constitutionalists and Republicans will try their fortune. Now, as to a practical effect,-the actual election of an Opposition candidate,-of course, that is a matter in which the Government is omnipotent. The custody of the ballot-boxes and the proclamation of votes are functions of the authorities, and we can scarcely doubt the result. But these things can never be kept entirely secret. By private communication it will be known if any Opposition candidate receives a large number of votes, and the strength of the parties disaffected to the Imperial power will be pretty accurately tested. Under these circumstances the Government has given symptoms of something like alarm. The Prefeet of the Seine, and now the Minister of the Interior, have published manifestoes in a tone of mingled defiance and supplication, which cannot fail to produce a bad effect. M. HiAusmANx addresses the electors of the Seine with a heat which is both insulting to them and undignified in himself; while M. BmTAULTr's message to the Prefects betrays no small apprehension, veiled under an hysterical affectation of confidence. On the whole, we cannot believe that the present elections will add much to the Imperial prestige. It would have been wise to leave France quiet while she was prostrate; the chain neither clanked nor burdened her; now that she is bidden to rise and dance in her fetters she must hear their ill-omened sound and feel their intolerable weight.
If statesmen and legislators find a difflculty in reducing discussions on the Estimates to a desirable form, the embarrassment is certainly none the less in the case of journalists. On Friday night the House of Commons, after an argument upon the best method of extricating themselves from the impediments of their own rules of procedure, went on to scrutinize and estimate one vote after another through a debate which occupied five or six of our columns the next morning. Of this debate our readers will naturally expect some account, considering that upwards of 200,0001. of the public money was ultimately voted, and that many differences of opinion were expressed. We find it, however, by no means easy to present the discussion in a shape either compendious or popular, for it ranged over a wilderness of subjects, and while one party censured the Government for its awkward distribution of the votes, another censured the censors themselves for the incomprehensible arrangement of their objections. " It " was not too much to say," observed Lord T. MA.immxns of Mr. W. WLAusxs, " that when he sat " down the Committee had not the faintest con" ception what vote he was speaking about." We do not much wonder at this comment, but 3Ir. WILLIAMIS might plead in his defence that the subject scarcely admitted of precision. When a vote of 50,0001. is asked for " Public Offices " or " Royal Parks " the demand necessarily involves a multitude of heterogeneous items, and it is only by an aggregate of small criticisms that the main objection can be sustained. There really, lhowever, was but one principle of any public importance brought before the House in al the discussions to which we refer ; the rest of the controversy turned upon points of detail or questions of amount. Four considerable votes were debated, -one of some 40,0001. for the maintenance and repair of Royal Palaces; one of nearly thrice the sum for the Royal Parks and Pleasure-grounds; one of 60,0001. for the maintenance and repair of Public Buildings; and one of about half the amount for the furniture of Public Offices, &c. In the case of the Royal Palaces the question was very simple indeed. These edifices exist, and, unless it could be proved expedient to pull them downwe speak of those no longer in the occupation of Royalty,-common sense advises that they should be kept up properly and turned to the best account. Mr. Wlr.LIAsrS'S selection of Hampton Court was a most unlucky one, for there could hardly be a Palace more truly appertaining to the people. It affords an honourable residence for the representatives of those who have deserved well of their country, and it is a source of gratification and enjoyment to the whole metropolitan population. On a fine Sunday nearly as many persons as were brought together last week by the stupendous Festivals in the Crystal Palace pass with quiet pleasure and satisfaction through the apartments and grounds of this ancient mansion, and if a few thousands a-year are required to keep the place in the order in which we see it the money is unexceptionably spent. The great question of prinlciple to which we alluded, though raised on the application of public money to metropolitan Parks, is involved also in the expenditure upon the Palaces aboveruen- tioned. The argument is, that places of amiusement or recreation, such as the Parks in the vicinity of the capital, should be mine. tained, not out of the fands contributed by the, nation at large, but through local taxes raised froml the particular communities which enjoy the advantage of the resort. Mr. BLACKBUIN generalized the objections thus suggested, and moved such a reduction of the vote for the Royal Parks as would bring the amount to the average sum required during the five years' preceding Sir BE1AJsn HALL's administration; but the motion -the only one carried to an actual division throughout the debate on these matters-was negatived by more than 3 to 1. At this we are not surprised; indeed, we concur entirely in the opinions thus predominating. As far as regards the cleansing of the lake in St. James's Park, we might support our views by Mr. BLACxsBUBzS oWn admissions, for he acknowledged that the Parks should be kept " in good order," and good order undoubtedly requires that a piece of ornamental water should be pure and healthful rather than filthy and pestiferous. But we prefer considering the question in a broader light. Supposing such views as several members seemed to entertain, and Mr. Bai;er more particularly expressed, were to be recognized and established, where, we beg to ask, would it be possible to maintain anything izational at all? A park, a gallery, or an institution of any kind, with whatever title it may be dignified, must needs have a local habitation, and therefore contribute more directly and largely to the advantages of that locality than to those of the kingdom at large. A national collection of paintings, for instance, is accessible to the immediate neighbourhood at all times,-to the bulk of the population only now and then, and at more or less cost and trouble; yet for all this it is surely a national institution, and not a local one. The case is certainly not so strong as regards a park, since a park or a pleasure-ground may be found anywhere, while a gallery of pictures is more out of the common way; but, unless a " metropo" lis" is to be robbed of its distinctive characteristics, the very idea implies that it is the capital, not of a province, but of the whole State. Not only do thousands visit it, but the millions who dwell within its walls are entitled by their very position to national consideration. It is because London is the seat of Government, and because the affairs of the whole nation are there administered, that a population of two millions and a quarter is compressed into the district under conditions deserving all the mitigation practicable. Add, moreover, to these numbers the numbers attracted to the metropolis by the casual allurements of business or pleasure,-by such festivals, for instance, as those celebrated last week, and the result will represent such a proportion of the whole population as will render metropolitan interests almost equivalent to Imperial interests. Who can say, indeed, that Hampton Court is for the benefit of Londor.ers only, when there is not a town in England to some of whose inhabitants it has not been a source of delight ? The case of "1 Public Buildings" was discussed simply with reference to points of convenience and arrangement. Sir J. TRELAWNY inquired why the British MIuseum should not be opened in the evening, so that working men might share more largely in the advantages of the institution. The CCAxurjoB of the ExcnxquwR replied, that the matter had been under consideration, and especially as regarded the reading-room, but that the danger arising from lights was too serious to be encountered-a justifiable ground of objection, beyond all doubt. The next point concerned the establishment of certain scientific societies in Burlingtonhouse. Some of these bodies enjoyed by Royal grant a lodging in Somerset-house; others had been similarly indulged without quite so unimpeachable a title. When the collection of the Succession Duty caused additional room to be required by the Inland Revenue Department in Somerset-house the learned societies were invited to remove by the offer of apartments in Burlington-house, and the expense of adapting this mansion to their wants brought the whole queation upon the table. Mr. DrummoND spoke with unqualified contempt of these incorporated philosophers; Lord PA.iRsToIT stood up for science, as if the nation had a good many shortcomings in this way to be covered; the public, we suspect, will ag,ree with the Minister. There can surely be no harm in giving the representatives of science such an official resort as may serve to keep their collections together, and to I centralize their powers. Considering that all the motions referred to, except MIr. BLACMBUN'S, were either withdrawn or negatived without a division, the reader may perhaps be disposed to criticize the utility of the i discussion, but we have little doubt that these debates, unproductive as they may seem, are, in reality, very useful in their effect upon our financiers. It does not foUlow that because a vote is allowed after all, it may not have been modified originally by the anticipation of this very scrutiny, nor do we think that the House of Commons is often open to Mr. Wi,LLiAMs's reproach of voting away the public money with alacrity. On the contrary, its decisions seem frequently rather reluctant than otherwise-like those of a man who cannot pick a hole in any item of an account, and yet grumbles fiercely at the total This, in fact, is often the best kind of justification producible for the Estimates in general. If Government gets into the dilemma so do individuals, and the sharpest among them, too. How many of us are quite content with the sum total of our yearly expenditure ? How many of us, when we resolve upon retrenchment, can find the point at which the pruning-knife can be applied without invincible outcry or disproportionate damage X It is the same with the finances of the empire, and the moral should be this-that even when discontent does not make the outlay much less it is probably the only sentiment which prevents its becoming far greater.
Things are very dull just now. There is an end of Epsom and Ascot. The King of PRsssiA and the Neuchbtelois have settled their little differences. The Chinese affair drags on so heavily ihat we can scarcely expect the public to be very eager about the fresh monthly number of intelli- I gence from the source of tea. At home the new House of Commons is doing its work with all the energy, all the occasional wildness, and all the ultimate docility of a batch of raw rweruits. We have talked out the annual exhibition of the Academy. The rival managers of the two Opera-houses have displayed their tactics, and the interest in the Royal British Bank is only revived by the apprehension of its Directors. For a few days the public have contrived to exist upon the Manchester pictures, the Divorce Bill, and the HA&,DBL Festival at the Crystal Palace; but these brilliant bubbles have either burst, or the eye is sated with their radiance and marks them no more. When we turn to the other side of the Atlantic we find no diet for the public appetite upon which the merest qUidnivne could contrive to exist for one poor afternoon at the bow window of his club. The WALKER question, and the Kansas affair, and the Central Araerican difficulty seem either to have settled themselves or to be in course of amicable settlement or compromise. All goes well there. For the moment-and may that moment be indefl- nitely prolonget I-" -- HSi, Britaui r? ' "Rule, Columbia r" have become ihX national sirs of the United States. In the absence of more stirring, but less gratifying intelligence, wre can do no better than call particular attention io the report which we print this day from -the ifew Yor7 Herald of the festivities at Waaiingtaa held under the auspices of Lord NArPI, the English AmbI.aIlors on the anniversary of the birthday of our English QuzNz. Our American friends as far excel us in the style of their Court Circulars as they do in yadhtbuilding, lock-picking, and revolvers. The doement, which will be found in another portion of our columns, actually introduces us into the bet society at Washington. The acute, energetic, features of the men, the grace of the ladies, the keennems of their repartees, the majesty of their busts, the luxuriance of their hair, their oceasionsl embonpoint, and invariable charm wil here be found depicted with a graphic power far beyond the reach of our own domestic Jn,-N-xs. 'Tis a perfect gallery of photographs. Let us pick out a few characters at random; and, first, we should be worse than ungrateful if we did not achnowledge the handsome manner in which Lord and Lady NApinm are spoken of by the American chronicler of the revels. On that memorable night at "Fish-house" the aspect of the place "astonished "s ome and delighted all; it had a bright, fresh, " and janty look." Lord NArxn is pronoimced to be every inch a nobleman, and, should any New Yorker entertain any doubt upon the subject, he is told "to go to BRADY'S," and to see the inimitable photograph of his Lordship suspended there. Lady NArz, we are told, is of meium height and symmetrical figure; " the w;innin' "smile that plays over her fine features ii the "reflex of the happy disposition within." From Lord Nr.nMR and his fair ladly we pass by an easy tramsition to the rest of the Corps Diplo matique. The French Minister, Count SARG1!, "has a spice of hauteur in his manners that does "very well in an Ambassador." Thle choiceist flowers of the chronicler's rhetoric, however,? are reserved for the Ambassadress. " His Countess, " odevavt Miss THoRNDnmx, was one of: the "C ornaments of the ball. Though somewhat "stout for so young a person, her claims to Cbeauty are undeniable. Her bust is magnificent, "and her face is singularly attractive, from its "expression of real good nature." The Russian Minister's wife tbo, autrefois Mss TroxPsow, of Mamachusetts, was exceedingly affable and gay; but " perhaps this was the result of a hint from " her diplomatic spouse." The Washington writer is at great pains to tell us how Baron STOzCxE travelled aU night from New York to Washington, in order to be present at the fete of the English Ambassador, " lest any mis"take should arise as to the attitude of "his Court in reference to the dispute with "China." On the other hand-and we confess that, in a reciprocal spirit, we cannot look upon such a demonstration without suspicion-adame C Rm , the wife of a Secretary of the Russian Legation, wore her hair 4 la Chinoise, ostensibly "to enhance the effect of her strikng phy" siognomy." From, the Corps Diploraatique we pass to the native Americans, who, we confess, interest us much more. Why was not General CAss at the ball? The explanation is most satisfactory. General CAss intends no slight upon the British CRowN, but, as his habit is to go to bed at 10 o'clock every night, and as the dancing at Lord N±Pin&'s only began at half-past 10, it would have been not a little difficult for the General to be present in person. " So careful is " he of his health that he will not dine out, not "c even with the PnESDExT, and I doubt if he "c would sit up after 10 p.m. were he sure of the "nomination in 1860. Twenty years ago in Paris, at balls in his own splendid house,-and "he gave no end of them,-he would quietly slip "off to bed at 10 o'clock, as though he dreaded "the fate of CiND=m.r&, but, fortunately, he left "his amiable wife, three charming daughters, and "a host of attach6s to supply his place." From General CAss we pass to a circle of notabilities less known to the English reader. There was "the " tall and very gentlemanly Secretary to the Navy; " Governor Toucxy was there with his wife, who " is nearly as tall, and equally distinguished in " appearance and demeanour." Nor was the keen-witted and warm-hearted How= COBB, with his plump face, wanting to the festivity; nor Governor FLoYD, the Secretary of War, "with his " really martial appearance and martinet air." Then there was Judge BLAcK, the AttorneyGeneral, " with his searching, critical, disputatious "countenance, one of the most awkward customers "in a law argument any man can meet with. "His wife, too, Europe will rejoice to hear, is a "phenomena not only of beauty, but of extra"ordinary youth. Her daughter is grown up, "and it is not easy to say which is the senior of "the two." Is this the way Court Circulars are written in America? The endeavour to reproduce here the whole of this portrait-gallery would be useless; we must refer to the catalogue, which we print in extenso, for further and more accurate information. There it wiU be found how the Hon. Jomn APPLETON, although habitually a grave person, seemed to enjoy the levities. MIrs. APPIETox is a sprightly and highly cultivated person-she is, we are told, " admirably " adapted for society, and it is therefore no " wonder she seemed quite at home at the balL" But we must positively refuse to make any mor) selections from this wonderful Gallery of Illustration. If our own Court Circular would give us anything equally interesting and characteristic about our grandees, the general mass of maukind might take greater interest in their amusements. Finaly, let us add, we heartily rejoice to see that Lord NAPIER has won such good opinions at Washington, and stands so well with American society.
We are confessedly the worst hands at a spectacle in the world. For State ceremonies, pageants, and shows of all kinds we have lost the simplicity of nature without acquiring the ingenuity of art. Even when we do by accident stumble into something pretty, picturesque, and popular, something that tells its own tale and is pleasantly remembered, the authors of the unwonted success seem ashamed of their own achievement, and are anxious not to repeat it. By universal consent, the most interesting home incident of the late war-a hundredfold more interesting than a slow, sick, and smoky naval review, or whole volcanoes of slyrockets-was the Distribution of Medals on the Parade behind the Horse Guards. Old people who had seen all sorts of things, including the rejoicings at the Peace of 1814, declared that this beat them all. It came as a surprise; it cost nothing but a few deal boards and a little red baize, and an immense number of people had good or tolerably good views of it. MIany more might have seen it, for the galleries under the Horse Guards were not more than half fiUed. People all understood it; they looked into the programmes, asked cc Who's " that I Wh's thatl" and wiiU carry with them to their last day the touching figures of our maimed and mutilated warriors, as they limped or were wheeled up to the throne. Now we are to have . similar oeasion next Friday, when Ha MA-TESjy 'will distribute the Victoria Cross, awarded for special acts of bravery during the war.

DEATH OF LADY EvERsLEY.-It is with great regret that we have to announce the decease of Visconntess :Everdley, the wife of the late Speaker. The melancholy event took place at an early hour on Saturday morning at Tsis Lordship's new house, 69, Eaton-place. The noble lady Ilad been im her usual health and strength till the beginning of this week.

AMERICA. (BY aLnMC MAD INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH.) LIVERPOOL, Ju.N 2L The Royal mail steamship Arabia has arrived with advices from New York to the 10th and $2,265,224 and 3001.; $500,390 is for France. The Waahington correspondent of the New Yor7. Herald asserts that in a despatch of 12 pagesto Lord Napier Govsernor Cass had declined tco reopen for the present negotiations on theCentral American question. Another correspondent of the same journal understands that the Secretary of the Treasury will recommend the repeal of all laws requiring the coasting trade to be carried on in American ships. A despatch to the New York- Trib says,- " The pressure for the Consulship to London is so -avere that the President has concluded to supersede Goneral Camp. bell, though personaUy attached to that gentleman. The story of the intended visit of General Filibuster Walker to the city is not credited here, as a writ awaits him from the United States' Circuit Court of New York, at the suit of Commodore Vanderbilt, for plundering the Transit Company. Colonel Cummings is reported to have received the appointment of Governor of Utah." A despatch from Washington says the President has declared that in matters relating to the Nicaraguan transit he will not recognize Costa Rica as having any coutrol over it. A report that Governor Walker would be recaUed from Kansas to t.ke the place of General Cass as Secretary of State had been contradicted. At Caraccas, Venezuela, an occurrence of some interest had taken place, the British Charg6 d'Affaires having solemnized a marriage between two native Roman Catholics, contrary to the rules of the church. The bride being stepdaughter to her husband, the Archbishop and Pope had previously refused their sanction. Lord Palmerston had been written to on the subject. General Jose Mocagas had renounced his title of General-in-Chief, and resolved not to recognize the new General of Government. Great excitement prevailed. At New York trade continued dulL There was more activity in the money-market, though rates were not materially changed. High grade paper went at 7 to Si per cent., according to maturity, anld for which the demand exceeded the supply; fair names were current at 10 to 32 and 15 per cent. The Bank statement was favourable. Stocks were feverish and excited, the "Bears" having the control of all the speculative descriptions, and a decline from day to day was the consequence. Bank insurance Federal and State securities, however, were firm. Exchange on London, 9a to 9i. Cotton was at a stand still, holders refusmg to sell at the price offered.

The decrease in the receipts, as compared with the same date last year, is 237,000 bales at that port, while at all the southern ports it foots up 547,000 bales. Freights are stagnant.

A DIMAWING-ROOM ADVBNTUBB. We have been favoured with the following graphic description, by the pen of a distinguished lady, of the adventures -which befell her at the late Drawing-room:- " I fell into the line at a few minutes after 1 o'clock in New Bond-street and arrived at the Palace ata quarterafter 2, ascended the orowded stairs, and in due time reached the Armoury, where I joined my friends, the Countess Dowager of-, her daughter, and two other ladies. We had no gentleman with us, and were soon wedged in the centre of a dense throng, momentarily increasing from behind, and, as the bar was not down, it was impossaible to advance an inch, as all the narrow limits of that apartment and thenext were filed nearly to suffocation. After waiting patiently for half an hour or longer we found the obstruction was re. moved, and, impeled onward by the vexed multitude inthe rear, we entered the room where our first cards were received. This occasioned another stoppage, but the gentlemen on duty were so alert and adroit in receiving them that we got on without much difficulty to the entrance of the ' chamber of horrors,' and were in the act of entering, when a tall, athletic, burly, red-faced biped in a deputy-lieu. tenant's uniform, with a short lady on his arm, having forced his way up the side of the room, broke through all rules of order or good breeding by endeavouring to wrestle himself and the lady into the room before us. Perceiving his intentions to be desperate, I entreated him not to push tiUl we were through the doorway, where the pressure was already frightful. ' Kindly grant us a moment's grace, Sir,' I said, 'and we shall all be through without difficulty, and you will follow in the line.' Without paying the slightest attention to this appeal, he resolutely effected his purpose, asd that with such reckless disregard to the feelings of theladies with whom he came into contact that I was precipitated over a bench, which had been fixed, most improperly, as if to continue the obstruction of the narrow entrance. If I had been aware of the eircumstance I might, perhaps, have recovered my balance, but it was all the serprise of the moment. I do not suspect the author of the accident meant to commit an outrage which might, had it happened in Queen Eli7abeth's days, whentheEarl-Marshal's baton was not borne in vain, have been productive of awful consequences to himself. This was merely the result of a selfish desire of accomplishing his own object of getting up to the pen as soon as possible; and such collisious wiU continue to occur so long as the time allowed for the receptions is so unreasonably brief that every one is in a manner under the apprehension of being shut out at 4 o'clock, or soon after, when the doors of the Presence Clhamber are, I am told, inexorably closed against those who have not succeeded in getting through. Now, all the izcrease of accommodation that may be devised will no, prevent this mortification to the last comers. Hence the excitement, the impatience, and ferocity of the pushers and drivers, who are determined to force their way to the Presence Chamber. I think the evil might be easily remedied by Her Majesty herself if she could be induced to perceive the expediency of giving her loyal subjects more frequent and easy access to the performance of their homage by having three Drawing-rooms in every month while she is in town, and not unnecessarily fatiguing herself by standing. Why should she not be seated ? Why should she receive the circle entitled to the privilege of the cattree on the same day with the general circle, for whose reception the time is thus abridged into an hour or less in consequence, and great vexation incurred by those who find themselves necessarily shut out? Unless this unpopular arrangement be altered I fear worde evils than torn dresses and broken ornaments to the visitors may follow. In regard to my own accident, of which I still bear the traces, I am only too thankful I escaped so well; for, though I fell on a soft carpet, the skin was broken and blackened on the right temple, and my brooch and bracelet broken by the violence of the fall, my dress torn, and myself rudely shaken. The ladies among whom I was precipitated were very kind and compassionate to me, administering salts and eau de Cologne, so that I presently recovered sufficiently to proceed, though I had the mortification of passing through the Royal presence with a visible proof of the ungentle treatment I had undergone on my brow. The man in scarlet who had overthrown me took no notice of the aocident his rudeness had oceasioned, nor have I the slightest idea who he was. The confusion at going away was, if possible, worse than the difficulties of the approach. The crush and bad order in the lobby prevented me from reaching my carriage when it was called several times, so that I did not leave the Palace tiUl past 6 in the evening, in a state of great exhaustion. "I am sure the ladies owe you many thanks for your truly chivalric efforts to point out these inconvenionces, and procure better treatment for them from thelords of the creation; but, unless more time be allowed for the general reception, they will, I fear, be unavailing."

COURT CIRCULAR, The Queen held a Court on Saturday afternoon for the reception of addresses on the Throno. The Archbishop of Canterbury, wearing his Convocation robe, arrived at Buckingham Palace at a-quarter before 8 o'clock, accompanied by Bishops and Clergy of the province of Canterbury. His Grace and the deputation were ushered to the Green Drawing-room, and subsequently were admitted to the presence of Her Majesty on the Throne, his Royai Highness Prince Albert being by the side of the Queen, In attendance near the Soverelgn were Sir George Grey, Secretary of State for the Home Department; the Dachesa of Wellington, acting for the Duchess of Sutherland; the Marchioness of Ely, Laay in Waiting ; Earl Spencer, KG., Lord Steward; Marquis of Breadalbane, K.T., Lord Chamberlain; the Dake of Wellington, Master of the Horse; Earl of Mulgrave, Treasurer; Lord Erne3t Bruce, ViceCbamberlain; and Viscount Castlerosse, Controller of the Household. The Archbishop of Canterbury was accompanied by the Bishops of London, Winchester, Oxford, Hereford, Chichester, and Worcester ; the Dean of Bristol (Prolocutor); the Deans of Westminster and Worcester; the Archdeacons of London, Westminster, hiddlesex, Buckingham, Bedford, and Bristol; Rev. Dr. Jeromie, Rev. Dr. 'Caul, Rev. Mr. Randolph, Rev. Mr. Lloyd, Rev. Mr. Oxenden, Rev. Mr. Seymour, Rev. Mr. lills, Rev. Mr. Leighton, Rev. Mr. Harding, Rev. Mr. Hopper, Rev. Mr. Burton, Dr. Twiss (Vicar-f3eneral of the Plrovince of Canterbury), F. H. Dyke, Esq. (Registrar of Convocation) George ]Burchett, Esq. (Actuary of Convocation), and Felix Knuyvett, Esq. (Arch. bishop's Secretarv). fir Grace read to the Queen the following Addres from the Archbishop, Bishops, and Clergy of the Province of Canterbury in CJonvocation Assembled: Madsaun-We, your Majesty's faithful subjeots, the archbibhop, bshops. and clergy of the province of Canterbury. In Convocation assimbled, approach your Majesty with the assurance of our loyal and affectionate attachment to your Majesty's Throne and pemon. We fetl it to be a ground of mush ta nesa to Almighty God that In offering this our accustomed address we are able to joln with lIt our husble congratulations on the blesings which It has pleased isi to continue to your Majesty and to your iUustrious consort-bleisags wbich arehappily shared by the country at large, as weu in regard toitt internal tranquillity and welfare as to the restoration of peace among the Europeani Powera. At the same time, we would desire to offer our letpecpful coudolence upon the lOes of that excellent Princess vhose decease macks the removal of a generation of your Ma. jesty'd illustrious hours. Since the last occasion when we were permitted to address your Majesty several subjects of muoh interest to the national church have been brought undor our O3nsideration. Among these we humbly conceive that none calls moze urgeatly for our attention than the best mode of extending the blesings of the church to the increasing population,whlch bas far outgrown the actual provision both of the number of clergy and of the fundsavailable fortheirsupport. Whilewedeepl7regresthisspiritual destitution we thankfully acknowledge the measure of private liberality which has been directed towards the purpose ot oonveying the messnB of grace to our population at home. and to those colonial possessions of your Majesty which are so widely extending the laws, the language, the liberties, and, as we trust, the religoa of our native laid. It is a gratifying reflection that, through private runficence, with little assistance from public sourcee, your Majestys relgn has been signalized by the erectionoof new sees in eTery quarter of the globe-from Africa to New Zealand, from Victoria t o Rupert' fLand. We have obeened with satisfaction that your Majesy hasbeenpleased to appointa oommissiontoconsidertheboundaries of some of the diocess in England, and we earnestly pray that their inquiries and recommendations maoy be so directed as to sromote the efficency and well-being of our Church. In the promotion of publis education-a question which intimately concerns us as ministerm of religion-we thankfully acknowledge the iberal aid aforded us by publi grants. The attention directed towards the instruction of the young is a marked feature of the present age, but we deeply deplorc the difficulties which in too many cases induoe the labouring clasaes to remove their children from school at a Tre-y early age, before they have received the fall advautages of a sound education and been properly in2structed in their duty towrods God and mr "It is difficult to suggest the remedy, but if It should please your Mfajesty, in accordance with the spirit of that general summons inyser htajesty's writ 'to treat of oertain diffloult andurgent affairs oocoerning your Majesty, the security and defence of the Church of Euggland, and the peace and tranquUUty and publio good of your kingdom and your subjects of the same,' to commit to our special deliberation this or any other question affecting the interest of our holy religion or the usefulness of the ohurch, we trust that we shaU not be foumd unmindful of the solemn ochracter of the functions we are called to discharge, and shall oonduct our proceedings iu a spirlt of reverent deDendence upon the Dirine bless. ing, and with the diligence which would become us in obeyIng your M%jesty's commauda. Eitherto the shortness of time given to our consultations has in a great measure frustrated the adva. tages which we humbly trust would result if fuller opportnity ware rfforded for asertaining the opinions of the clergy by dscousdon in Convocation. Meanwhile, we assure your Maj3est that any difficulties which may inpede our endeavours to convey the gosDel of our Lord and barlour Jesus Christ as the rullug principle of life to every parih and to every individual In the land will rather serve to stimulate than restrain our exertions; and we have the encouragement of knowing that, while we attempt to carry Into effect this important purpose, we are promoting the earnest wish and prayer of your Majesty, whon God has appointed to be our Supreme Governor on earth, and whom we trust that HEe may long preserve to see the increase of tempofal prosperity and the growth of true religion throughout your Majesty's dominions.1 Her Majesty returned the following most graoious answer:- I receive with much gratification your renewed assuranoe of loyal and affectionate attachment to my Throne and Deron, and I thank you Soryour expression of sympathy with oy deeop orrowfor thereo ent loes of my beloved aunt, the late Duchess of Gloceter. I heartily concur-in your feelings of gratitude to Almighty God for the mauy and great biselngs which He has bestowed on my fami4l and on this nation: and I sincerely pray that your realoun endeavours to increame the efficiency of the church, to extend Its ministrations, end to render them as conducive as Dossible to the advancement tbroughout my dominions of pewce and happiness, truth and justice, relgion and piety, will, by the Dlvine blessing, tend to establih our national prosperityon the surest foandatlons, and to promote the ermanent welfare and highest interests of al classe of my people." The Archbishop kissed hands. The Prolocutor, the Dean of Bristol, had also the honour to kiss the hand of the Sovereign. His Grace, with the Bishops and clergy, then withdrew. An address of congratulation from the corporation of the city of London was then presented. The Lord Mayor had previously arrived at the Palace in his State coach, drawn by six horses.

The Lord Mayor and Corporation having been conducted to Her Majesty, the Recorder read the Address from the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the city of London, in Common Council assembled, congratulating the Queen on the birth of a Princess. Her Majesty returned the following maost gracious answer:- '1 Your loyal and dutiful iIddress has afforded me sincere satisfaotion; and I tbank you for the deep interest which you h%ve expressed in the domestic haDpiness of snycelf and my beloved Consort.

TO THE EDITOB OF A-HE TIMAES. Sir, -Among the numerous suggestions with reference to a suitable site for our national galleries it appears unaccountable that such a splendid situation as the ground upon which the old Palace of St. James's now stands should have been altogether overlooked. To my mind, it is most admirably adapted for such a purpose, for it combines in a degree superior to all others that have been proposed all the requisites for such an institntion. Being open in the rear to the St. James's Park there is a free ciroulation of air, which is of such paramount importance to prevent the varnish of pictures from becoming chilled. There is ex cellent light. The situation is central,-not being too fae away from the heart of the town, as would be the case with regard to Rensington, and yet not being so much surrounded with impure atmosphere as Trafalgarsquare. The only objection of any value that could be urged against this proposal is that inconvenience might arise in consequence of the Court being held at St. James's. This matter of routine, however, could easily be surmounted by letting the' drawing-rooms and levees be held at Buckingham Palace, as all the State receptions are at present. But I think that even a better arrangemont than this would be to make the new building serve the double purpose of a National Gallery and a Palace in which to hold the Court. Nothing could be more grand than to have the Court of so powerful a Sovereign as the monarch of the British Empire held in a succession of spacious halls ap. proached by wide corridors and staircases, and filled with costly works of art. Moreover, that paltry Palace of St. James's, which both externally and internally is a disgrace to England, would be replaced by a handsome palace, which might be made the finest of the sort in the world. I do not see that any serious obstacle can stand in the way of such a plan being put into execution; andl trust, for the sake of adding to the embelishment, and, indeed, the respectability of the metropolis, that you wiU lend the powerful aid of your journal in advocafing its adoption. I remain, Sir, your obedient servant. A RATEPAYER. I

SCARCrIY OF CoToN.-A large public meeting of theCotton Supply Association was held at the Town-hal, Manchester, on Friday, to consider the present inadequate sup of cotton, andthe bestmeansof extending itsgrowth. hlr.. Watts, Mayor of Manchester, presided, and there were present Lord Stanley, M.P.; Colonel W. Patten, .P.; Mr. W. EI. Horoby, M.P.; Mr. Kershaw, MP. - Sir A. Plamsay. hLP.; Mr. James Platt, M.P.; Mr. Y1. A. Turner, hLP., and many influential gentlemen conneoted with the toWn and district. Mr. J. A. Tamer, M.P., moved the first resolution, which was as followfs: That, in the opinion of this meeting, the SUpply of cotton to tbli counnat Iy inaOeqiitC to the requtremente of man.factnug induatry. and, being almost entirely derived from one souroe, Is uncertain in qastatty an8 unduly iLuctuating in price. That thts meeting believes ttle colonial and other dependencesl of (Ireat rItain afford ample resources forthe cultivutlon and developemeut ot the cotton plant, and that it is the duty as well as the intereat of the Iritisle nation to aid tn the protnotion of those efforts by means by which ita growth may be extended not onlb In tieo British dominions, but in ad accessible countries." In moving this resolution Mr. Turner deprecated the aphthy of the trade upon the subject, and said that unless they could devise means to supply the present deficiency of cotton the evils would be aggravated and the prosperity of the manufacturing districts would very rapidly decline. Mr. 0. Heywvood having seconded the resolution, Lord Stanley remarked upon the importance of the subject, and entered into various statistics to show the increase of our productive powers, while at the same time the supply of cotton was becoming more deficient. The noble lordremarked that our supply of cotton involved some political considerations which were sufficiently obvious. Without wishing to overstate the cae, he considered that our almost exchisive de- endence on the United States for our cotton was neither desirable nor safe, however improbablo it might be that the supply would be interrupted, either by war, by a social disturbance in the Southern States, or by a failure of the crop, his state of dependence was of comparatively recent origin, and it was increasing year by year. In considering howr we were to remedy the evil, he by no means recomimended exclusive attention to one part of the world, hut, after alL whatever we could do elsewhere, it was to British India that we must chiefly look. There we bad the government in our hands, a people singularly docile, and not unfitted for industry, a command of labour which waa pratialy unlimited, and vast districts comparatively, if not whoUy, uncultivated. Colonel Patten, M.P., Dr. Buist, of Bombay, and Mr. T. S. Mort (late member of the Legislative Councll of Australia), also supported the resolution,1l which was agreed to iuanimously. Mr. E. W. Watkins, iP. for Yarmouth, raoved the second resolution:- " Tat this meeting hails with satis!%ctiou tho lormatlon 8o the Cotton Snluply Association in bJancbe,ter, and pledges lVelSf o use Sta best endeavours to promote the objecta of that awclatln, and the the petition to the disse of Comnontmow reed In support of the petition of Mxr.

Tbere were on the platform the Bishops of London, Oxford, and St. Asaph, the Earl of Barrowby, Lord Feverabeos, Sir W. P. Wood, Vice-Chancel1or, Alderman Copelaod, M.P., SirThomas Phillips, Ir. 70stce Coleridge, the Rev. Mr. Cunningham, &o The progrtamtne of the proceedings Ombraced the performance of ad anthem (Handel), the " Benedictus" (Mozart), aud " La Carita'r fRossini), by the choir of Lincoln's-inn, assisted bymermbers of the Sacred Barmonic Society, under the direction of Mr. Jesiah Pitman, organist to the Hon. Society. An appromriate prayer having been odered up by the Bishop of London, his Royal Higbness opened the proceeding8 of the day by observing that on that occasion he appeared for the first time as the President of Kine's College HospitaL (Cheers.) He begged to tender to the supporters and friends of that valuable institution hia grateful acknowledgments for the honour they had conterred upon him. In doing so he could not but reflect with regret that the cause of that honour having been conferred upon him was the death of a nobleman-au intimate friend and acquaintance of hie ownwhose loss all must deeply lament. He was a man who during life promoted every useful and charitable institution of this country; aud it now became his duty to endeavour to attain to the same amount of usefulness in the world which his noble friend acquired during his earthly career. (Cheers.) After briefly adverting to the absence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had been summonod to attend at Her Majesty's Court, his Royal Highness said that he had lost had the advantage of a personal inspection of the hospital, and he thought it worth the while of anybody, who had leisure to witness what be had done, notwithstanding the difficulties which had been encountered. The organization seemed perfect, and reflected Freat credit on those who had the management of the institution. Such an inspection would convince everybody that it was of the greatest importance that so excelent and useful an establishment should be extended to the farthest possible limits. At present the accommodation was not more than half of that which was required. The annual increase of out-patients and inpatients 'was enormous. As a proof of the extensive utility of the institution, no less than 1,0001. a-year was ended in medicines alone. The locality of the hospi was certainly very confined, but it should be borne in mind that this vast city, spreading out in every direction, rendered it impossible to select open sites, while the thickly inhabitedportions of the metropolis all the more required hospitals for the sick. Yet, it was to be regretted that large intermediate spaces were left without such institutions. Such an arrangement was most inconvenient, impolitic, and objectionable, The King's College Hospital had the advantage of being in ihtimate connexion with King's College. Those gentlemen who were at that college, studying for the medical profession, enjoyed the advantage an uwsefulness of the hospital by obtaining that instruction which was calculated to qualify them for their profession in after life. The theological students elso derived great service from the institution, for there was no more important duty to be discharged by a minister of the church than the attendance upon the sick and the poor. Another advantage enjoyed by this hospital was the nursing system there pur. sued-a system superior to any yet established in giving aid and comfort to the sick. The general appearauce of the interior arrangements was most satisfactory. The wards were conveniently constructed, and cleanliness, neatness, respectability, and comfort were observable throughout. Even so apparently trifling a thin as that of flowers decorating the window sills and placed about the rooms was not to be passed by unnoticed. They of themselves gave an air of cheerfalness and comfort to the chambers of the sick, while by such minuto attentions the sufferings of the patients couldnotfailto be alleviated in thus finding themeelveshealed as if they were comfortably at home in their ovnt beds. There was one point of view in which hospitals were not sufficiently appreciated. Their chief purpose unqustionably was to administer relief to the sick and to heal the diseased; but beyond these benefits they incidentally conferred a great and lasting moralservice on many who became inmates of them. The habits, feelings, tendencies, andeverything affecting the character of the individual must be benefitted by the moral traioing which the system pnursued at such an institution necessarily imparted. Ln supporting pubHo hospitals, therefore, they were not only administering aid and comfort to the sick, but were preparing for them a better and happier existenoe through life, and a much more hopeful future in every sense of the word. (Cheers.) The sum required for so great an undertaking as the present was certainly very considerable. He was happy to inform the meeting that although 40,0001. was the sum stated to be needed, yet a very large portion of that moneyhadalreadvrbeencollected. ItreRected great credit on the committee of the institution that they had exerted themselves so effectually in that important work. BOt the sum still to be collected was consIderable. Seeing, however, the great object to be attained, and observing the large interest that was taken in it, he had not the least doubt that the committee would be able to accomplish the work they had undertaken. (Cheers.) The Bishop of OXFORD moved the following resolution- to.That thte large ameunt of relief afforde-d at Ring's Colleg Hospital tyly inreaing numbrea of sick poor, freely admi D not from the metroaolts only, but from distant Dart of tke kingdom, is at once a proof of great pabilo couddonce and a ground for continued and exHe concurred with his Royal Highness that the close ness of the locality which formed the site of the hospital, instead of being a disadvantage, was a great advantage, lying as it did close beside two great thoroughfaes of the metropoelis, from which branched narrow streets filled with houses of want and misery. He equally appreciated the important advantage arising from the connexion of the hospital with King's College, while he regarded with like satisfaction the improved system of nurses to which his Royal Highness had referred, and of which he was so competent to speak from a knowledge derived under other circumstances and in other climates (cheers), a knowledge ac2uired among scenes and in the midst of sufferings and eeds of terror, where the valour he displayed had endeared him personally to every Briton's heart. (Cheers.) The Earl of HARRonv-B, in seconding the resolution, said thlat in the presence of so many ladies he had peculiar pleasure in pointing their attention to that great object of female care, piety, and enthusiasm, the attendance of the sick in our great public hospitals. The resolution wals unanimously agreed to. Sir W. P.AGE WOOD moved the next resolution: That by re son of the remarkable and progre3-ive incrraae of the population of tbe metropolis,and the inidequacy of hospital acwommudation to supply the wants ot the inhabitantes eapeci Ily in those central dbitricts of London whih It., bewe,n oEiborn and the Thame-, the early completion of the bulidinpof allng's College Hospplal is an objeot of paramount importance." In the cour3e of his remarks the zight hon. and learned judge expresmed his belief that this country was almost entirely singular in regard to other empires in trusting to the benevolent feelings of the people for the relief and recovery of the sick poor. In every large kingdom in Europe provision was md e out of the public funds for the maintenance of those large hospitals which might be seen at Paris, Vienna, and elsewhere. Bat in this country there was alarge amount of Christiau feelingand principle to which the Government, might with confidence leave the good work of providirng institutions of this noble character. The resolution was seconded by the Bishop of ST. AsAPH and adopted unanimously. M1r. Alderman COPELAND, the treasurer, then read a list ofcontributions, at the head of which was the name of his Royal Highnes the Duke of Cambridge for 1001. (cheers) ; ISI per Mr. W.

W. E. Gladstone, 1001.. &c. A long list of the Ladies'!Committee for raising 10,0001. was also read, amounting already to nearly 1,5001. The following resolution was then moved by Mr. J. HI GRssxf, seconded by Alderman CorsAuNDw,and unanimously adopted:- "Trhat, alaoughb the imm'aIte friends Or the charity bays promiLed leral cofaibatlons,*owvrd, the aompletlon ,.f the hsepital, a. penleli by the magnitude of the nad>A]^tertaug,ed thisd. isetlneetgl- cheerfully aid tho commIttee of mansemeut by co operating in cheir effarts to mIss funds for completing tbe Irportant wore thoy have under- A vote of thanks was then passed to the treasurer and the Master and Benchers of Lincoln's-inn for bhving so readily aId obligingly granted the use of the hall. for the present meeting. Lord FRVERSHANl: then moved a vote of thanbli to his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge for having presided over the meeting that day, which was seconded. by MrJustice COLERIDGEA, and carried by acclamation and amie' loud cheers. The Royal DuKE, in expressIng his acknowledgments, observed that it had been said the citizens aed- inhabitantsa of London were somewhat backward in coming forwardb to support public charities, but he could not subscribe to that doctrine. He thought the inhabitants, of London were peculiar in the liberality of their dontrtions. ItSwas6true the Jarge institutions of this metropolis required. greab assistance, and they must strive evr to keepalive the interest of the people in those istiutios (Chaers.) It would be gratifying to the meeting to hfcinformed that no less, a sum than 15,0001. had already been contribated to the fend. (Cheers.) The National Anthem was then sung, aD& themoetIug separated.

During the early part of the sitting on Friday U,r. Newal±' and Eothwell were examlneu at the bar of the House in sup ozt of these chargeN and on the motion of Lord Palmers. In, Peter Johnson and J?oh Lord were ordered to attend the' House forthnith. Later in the evening-or, rather, early on Saturday saorning-. Lord appeared at the' bar in Custody of the Serjeant-at-Arns, and, upon being interrogated by the Speaker, admitted that he was presen.' when Peter Johnsoh offered Rothwell 50. to Absent himself,' but denied awing endeavoured to induce the latter to taket the money. The Sergeant-at-Arms at the same time inf rzaed the House that its order to attend had been served on Johnson, but that person failing to appear at the &'er he was adjudged guilty of contempt, and the Speak er was authorized to issue 'a warrant for his apprehensi. ^ A select committee, consisting of the Attorney-Ge. WeZL Lord John ERusselL ,Mr. Henley, theAttorney.General fobrlieland, Mlr. Horsman, MSr. B. Egerton, Sir H. Willoo gboy,. Mr. Roebuck, Mr. Macaulay, and Ur. Serjeant O'B.uea, was then appointed to investigate the whole subject * af the charges preferred by Mr. Newall, and was ordered tvimet for that purpose on Saturday. Although the public sould not have known anything of the affair until the publi cation of the morning papers on Saturday, containing repc rh of the Parliamentary proceedinvs of the previous evening,. the committee-room was crowded at the hour fixed for this commencement of the inquiry. In the space nually devoted to members of the House were Lord Goderi-dr,. Sir Alexander Ramsay, Sir. H Davie, Colonel Frenc.a, Mr. Serjeant Kinglake, and Mr. Hindleyv who, though noV chosen to serve on the committee, were anxious to be pre.- sent during the investigation. The officials of the House were represented by Sir Denis Le Marchant, Mr. Erskine May, and Captain Gosset, Shortly after 1 o'clock, when all the members of the committee had assembled except Lord John Russell, the Attorney-General, and MIr. Macauaay, the Attorney-General for Irelandwas, on the motion of Mr. Henley, requested to take the chair, and the first act of the right hon. gentleman in that position was to order the room to be cleared. Thereupon the members of the House whose names we have mentioned, the reporters, and the "p ublic" were hurried into the corridor, so well known to those interested in the passing of private Bills. ere they were left standing for half an hour in a stifling atmosphere, wonderiDg what could be the object of the committee in turning them out, and expecting every moment to be re-admnitted. But they were doomed to be disappointed, for at the end of the time stated th3 clerk of the committee appeared with a. sheet of paper in his hand, which, upon being affixed tS the door, was seen to contain these wrords:.-" Cirdered,-That strangers be not admitted ntil further orders." The door5 of the committee-room were atthosametimelocked. It; wasamusingtosee the effect which this notification poduced upon the members of the House whom it excluded from the inquiry. They could not fat frst believe that it applied to them, and when assured by the clerk that it did, their indignation was extreme, and found vent in expresions which the committeevwouldnotthankus for repeating. At lengthColonelFrenchgallantlunmdertookto assert the rights of his brethren, and, having obtained admission to the presence of the committee, protested against their resolation to conduct the investigation with closed doors, excli even members of the House of Commons. He cha them with exceeding the powers conferred upon them br the House, and, it may be presumed, questioned the justice. or propriety of pursuing in secret an inquiry which, if it; had been carried on in the House itself, as itf might have been, would have been open to d}h the world. But the arguments and remonstrances. of the gallant Colonel were in vain. The comrnittee remained firm in their resolution to discharge, the duty assigned to them in private; but, in deference tothe Colonel and his friends outside, they iseued a second notice stating the ground of their decision as follows .- " That the object of the inquiry will best be promoted bsy the investigation being carried on in the presenco of themembers of the committee alone." It is scarcely necessar to say that this attempt at conciliation produced an effiee the very reverse of that which it was intended tobave. eing, however, that it would bo useless and undigrified to contest the point any further, the offended senators after a parting growl, withdrew in no pleasant mood, a&d1 their example was followed by all whom business or curiositwhad drawn to the place. The committee, as they desired, were left alone, but it is not improbable that they may becalled upon this evening to defend thir conduct in theirp laces in the House. We may add that it was stated on Saturda that the officers of the House had not been able toexecute the warrant for the apprehension of Johnson. Ma.- sures had been taken, however, wve were informed, to insurethe attendance of LJord before the committee.
HAMPSTEAD HEATH ONCE MoRx. TO THE EIJTOR 0? THE TIMES. Sir,-I beg to call your attentio-. to a Bill brought in b- Mfr. Whiteside on Monday last, to amend (as he aUeges)the. Leases and Sales of Settled Estates Acts of last year. You will recollect that that Act contains a clause prohibitL. ing the Court of Chancery from granting an application for leasing powers, &c., in any case where the spplicant- hag. previously applied to Parliament for the same object andbeen refused. This clause (whicbwasearriedby a majority ofabout2to 1 in the House of Commons) was foundedcon. the plain principle that it was inexpedient and contrary toprecedent to make the Court of Chancery a Court of Appeal' from the decision of Parliament; and it was obvious thabr no injustice was thereby done to the promoters of meajuresheretofbre rejected by Parliament, since these persons retairn the right they previously had of applying again to thattribunal Itis now proposed by Mr. Whiteside to repeal this-olause, the introduction of which he last year strenuously,.butunsuccessfully, opposed. It is hardly conceivable that the proposal can receive the sanction of Her Majesty's Government, or of the House of Commons, since vWhat was just an& proper in 1856 canoot be unjust or improper in 1857. But,. as it impossible to say what influences may be brought. to bear on the question, it is hoped that yoa wil continue to raise that voice of warning which has heretofore been. exerted with so much benefit to the public.

But, while it mayfjbe observed that this argu.. ment is altogether foreign to the merits of the clause, itmust not be forgotten that the board has passed resolutions approving of the purchase of this and two other parks for the inhabitants of the metropolis, and that they are at this. very moment prosecuting in Parliament a Bill for the fornation of one of them-viz., that for Finsbury. That they. should bring in Bils for the formation of all three parks in. one year, and that only the second of their. existence, is. more than could be expected even from a body of greater, celerity of movement.

FOREIGN I.ATELLIGBYCE. ThE PARIS CONFERENCE. [A portlon of the following apporod in our second edition of Baturday :-I (BY SUBA&RINqS AND BlIRTISH TELEGRAn1}.) We have received the following telegraphic despatch from our Paris correspondent:- " PARIS, SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 8.30 A.Mb. "The Plenipotentiaries of Austria, France, Eng. land, Prussia, Russia, Sardinia, and Turkey met yesterday at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the purpose of signing the treaty for the frontier settlement in Bessarabia, and for regulating the ques. tion of the Isle of Serpents and the Delta of the Danube. " The iMmoniteur confirms the fact that a treaty of commerce was signed between France and Russia on the 14th of the present month." FRANCE. (FROM OcUR OWN COnREsPonDMn.) PARIIS, FRIDAY, Jusx 19, 6 P.u. M. Haussman, the Prefect of the Seine, has, like an able coinmander, reserved his fire for the last moment, but he comes out with terrible effect in this morning's Mrniteur. The Jupiter of the Hotel de Vile hurls his thunder, when least expected, in the form of an address to the " electors of the departmient of the Seine." M. Haussman was said to b in some disfavour lately at Court, and there were even unpleasant rumours of his removal from the high post of Prefect, which his nomination to the Senate seemed to justify. I trust Buch is not the case, but, if there really were apprehensions among bis friends, his present appeal ought to disperse them. It is true that the address of M. Hlaussman has failed, as far as I can lear, to give the unmixed satisfaction which he may have expected. People, not of the Opposition, think it too warm and too strong. The SiA¶le was visited with a warning only yesterday for attributing to its own candidates the exclusive possession of what the French papers love to call " the great principles of 1789," though hardly any two of them agree in the meaning of the term; and now we have M. Haussman, the first authority of the department of the Seine-one who exercises absolate rule over the Salle St. Jean, the Salle des Grandes Fetes, the Salle de Danse, the Salle du Trone, and the other saloons and corridors which constitute the Hotel de Ville, not to speak of the statues and caryatides inside and out,-committing the same offences, and informing the electors that the " deputies of another period and another order of ideas will expose them to agitation and uneasiness. NTow, be well assured of the fact." he says; " agitation and uneasiness recoil, above all, on those who work," and that " many of the candidates of the Opposition, open adversaries of the Imperial Constitution, only seek your suffrages in order openly to repudiate them." The Prefect of the Seine commits the same sin of rash judgment for which the SiUde has been punished, and it is the more inexcusable as it is committed by a public functionary, without whose concert and aid, at least so say some of his friends, the Emperor himsolf could not well get on. As to the "honourable independence" attributed by the Prefect to the outgoing deputies, the less said about that the better. This passage may be a bit of sly sarcasm at the Lower House, but the words quoted above have produced a very indifferent effect; and, as the Siece has received a warning, the least that can be done is to put the Prefect en pfnitevce. Those who suffer most during the trying period of the elections are, beyond all doubt, the Prefects of departments. The Minister of the Interior's circular was meant to point out the line they were to follow, but many of them appear to be at sixes and sevens. Some gave too liberal an interpretation to it-others too restrictive a sense-and not a few exhibit an unnecessary excess of zeal. When they are taken too sharply to task by the Minister, it is at least some comfort that they can fal upon the sub Prefects and Mayors-as Fag, in the Rieals, practises on the " Boy" what he himself has just received from his master. The Moniteur of tomorrow will contain a second address from the Minister of the Interior, with the view of further enlightening the electors on universal suffrage and on the object of the movement on the part of the Opposition. It is rather vigorous and decisive in style, and is superior, as it is much longer, than M. Haussman's. It will be posted up in all the public thoroughfares at the same time that it appears in the AIomiteur. The division of the Democratic party on the choice of candidates, giving a foretaste of what would occur if it were again in power, continues as strong, and apparently as hopeless, as ever. The Szixle patronizes M. de Laboulaye, of the Debats; the Debats does the same good turn for Prudhon's representative, M. Darimon; the Presse, with a wry face,however, accepts General Cavaignac, ewhor i hardly pardons for having put its chief editor under lock and key, without sentence of judge, or trial by court, in 1848; while certificates of approval are accepted from M. Degoussie, a decided Democrat, who, by way of proving his love of liberty, equality, and fraternity, proposed, also in 1848, to take up the journalists en rimsse, and keep them where they give trouble no more. I spoke of attempts at reconciliation between the rival sections of the Opposition; they have been fruitless, and the only restilt I fear is, that they dislike and ridicule each others' candidates as bitterly as before. The Siede has made the public merry with its sarcasm on what it calls the "Neo-Catholicism" of M. Jules Bastide, one of the thunderers of the defunct National, and Mqinister of something or other under the Marrast regime in 1848. M. J ules Bastide gets quite red in the face, puts his hand on his hip, snaps his fingers, shows very plainly that he forms a very low estimate of his brother Democrat's judgment, and beas very seriously that the Siecle " will not attribute to him religious or political opinions which he does not entertain." In the meantime the Sikle, the Journal des D, bats, and the Presse-tria juntta in uno-main. tain their list; the first boldly the second timidly, as if it trod upon eggs; the third grudgingly; while the Electoral Committee, whose organs are the Courrier de Paris (which has by a happy inspiration laid aside its name of La Veril, to which it had no claim) and the Estafette, maintain theirs, give no sign of reconciliation,and take-care to announce that theyhave no connexion with the establishment over the way, viz., the Sisde. Not only have both parties refused to make any sacrifice that would lead to an arrangement, or abandoned an iota of their pretensions, but they have begun to use hard words towards each other. Amid outpourings of peace and fraternal love are heard reproaches, menaces, and charges of intriguing. At one moment we were led to expect disclosures of a more serious kind, and curiosity was roused by hints about documents that would confound their opponents. The Estafette denounced the "Coalition" (the Siecle, Debats, and Presse) for having violated its engagements to the " Committee of Ancient Representatives" (les Anciens, as they are now termed); but the SiMcle has not yet taken up the challenge; while, on the other hand, the " Ancients" have shrunk from giving a decided contradiction to the SiQde, which reproached them with being the original cause tjfenim . Thne men who won the l evautose or quarreL ;nhe men who- won tervuin of February, reinforced by the Conservative Debats, have a batch of 15 candidates for the 10 electoral districts of Paris, five of whom, namely Cavaignae, Bethmont, Carnot, Goudchaux, and Lasteyrie, are accepted by both fractions of the ar; the 1O others are the apples of discord. R I. boulaye, Darimon, Vavin, Ollivier, and whoever is to take the place of Reynaud, who has withdrawn, are the preferred of the Debats, the Siecle, and the Presse; while the " Ancients" meet them with MM. Jean Reynaud, Garnier Pages (the eminent Finance Minister of the Provisional Government), Bastide, Jules Simon, and Pelletan. These last are, in the press, only supported by the Bstafette and the ex- VeniU (Coumrier de Paris), but they have at their backs a score or so of democratic leaders who were most of them functionaries under the Republic. On the other hand, we have the Socialists, who ap. parently do not warmlyapprove the policyof either. M. Louis Blanc, to whose circular or pamphlet I alluded yesterday, recommends, from his distant and safe retreat, that it should be impressed on the candidates, " as the condition of the snifrages they may obtain, {hat there should be produced inFrance not merely a superficial agitation, but a profound aud lasting emotion; that"the elected of the peopleshe~ll not, on thle opening of the Legislative Chambers, con- fial themselves to the refuaal of the oath,i but that the refusal shall be accompanied by reasons for not taking it. Should they be interrupted, the elected of the nation must insist-if menaced theymust resist-until, brute force intervening, they are clutched (empoigner)'" M. Louis Blanc anticipates a great moral effect| from this proceeding, and a oeriblie check to the Government. If the recusanta are proceeded against, why the worst that can happen is that they can join the refugees in London. " It belongs to our friends in France," he adds, "to decide to what point it is possible to realize the project in question, and what are the precautions that should be taken to insure its success. In any case, the difficulty would not be to gather together a sufficient number of bold men in a country where there always have been thousands of citizens ready to inunolate, for the public good or for a vigorous faith, their fortunes, their repose, their families, their lives. The people of France,-every page of our modern annals bears testimony to their inexhaustible devotion, and if the leaders of the bourgeoisie wanted to be recalled to the sentiment of their duty, they need only read once more the history of their fathers." Example, they say, is better than preaching. Why does not M. Louis Blanc, whc makes light of "repose, family, life," in compar7son with civic duty, jus,t take a run over to Paris incognito, and suddenly place himself at the head of the manifestation which he so fervidly recommends s The effect would be great, and if it were possible that so daring a spirit needed encouragement, there is the example of Curtiua and other ancient worthies, who gave the noble example of self-sacrifice under circumstances nearly as hopeless. The allusion to the " leaders of the bourgeoisie" (meneurs de la bourgeoisie) is evidently a hit at the Side, not to speak of the Debats; and it is additional evidence of the division of the Republican party. All these conflicting interests and rivalries do not, I fear, promise much for the organization of a Liberal Opposition in the new Legislative Body. They will rather add to the strength of the Government, powerful as it is aL-eady. I doubt the utility, after all, of a mere demonstration, for nothing else apparently is meant by the Democratic candidates. Whether for good or for bad, the present ,'igime is the issue of universal sufilrage; on universal suffrage alone the opposing candidates prefer to take their stand, and that by which they hope to attain success has already given absolute power to Louis Napoleon. How that power is used is another question. A great deal might not be gained by half-adozen Liberals getting seats in the Chamber, but something would be gained nevertheless, and m the cause of liberty no trifle should be despised. The presence in the Legislature of a few rational moderate Liberals, whatever difficulties they might encounter, would not be totally without fruit. The creditor does not act wisely who, because he cannot get paid at once the whole of his debt, refuses to accept any instalment. The better plan would be to present candidates who would not refuse the oath to the Sovereign elected by universal sufihfge; but a demonstration like that intended will, I fear, be barren in ita results. A deputation of the electors of the third arrondisement, in order to put an end to the doubt about the Opposition candidates taking the oaths, called on General Cavaignac yesterday, in order to ascertain whether it was his intention to do so. The General was rather puzzled what to reply. To answer in the negative was to trifle with the electors, and to answer in the affirmative he could not do without taking counsel of his ordinary advisers. He said that he could not give an answer then, and asked for time to consider.

Billault, the Mlinister of the Interior, has addressed the following circular to the prefects of departments:- " Monsieur le Prefet,-It is not sufficient that universal suffrage should be free; it must likewise be onlightened. The law in granting the candidates exceptional facilities freely to proclaiin and explain themselves during the 20 days which precede the ballot wished that the country, being thus perfectly instructed, should decide. We are arriving at the conclusion of this period of instruction and discussion. The Governmenthas scrupulously watched over the maintenance of the franchise of all; some have endeavouredtoabuseit,and underpretence of distributingvoting tickets wished torevive among the mass of the population the leaven of old democratical passions. The Government, which, if it vere necessary, could show that it has lost none of its force, or of its energetic will for the maintenance of publio peace, has allowed these impotent sallies to pass. It would not give even the slighest pretext for bad faith to calumniate that liberty which our laws secure to the electoral struggle. Candidates, journalists, instigators, or propagators of candidatures have all written and, acted freely. It is now for the country to meditate and to vote. Everybody has given his advice to the people-the Government owes them its opiion, and charges you, IL le Pr6fet, to make it known in all your communes. "In the midst of this perfect tranquillity, produced and maintained by the vigour of the Imperial power and by the absolute confidence which the people repose in theEmperorin presence of the general measures which proposed for reelection all the deputies whose loyal concurrence in public affairs offered in the past security for the future, it appeared that, with the exception of some individual pretensions without political bearing, no serious difference of opinion would agitate the ballot; but a small number of persons setting themselves up exclusively as democrats in the face of a Government established on the most democratic basis which ever existed has thought proper to commence a contest. Sheltering themselves under a formula of liberism, sufficiently vague that its elasticity might save them from the danger of their own dissensions, they endeavoured to supply the want of numbers by activity, and are makdng unheard of efforts everywhere to raise up opposition candidates. Bat what, then, is the object of this opposition? The country must know it; you, Monsieur le Prefet, must explain it to the people. "The majority of thecandidates broughtforward formerly professed }RepublicanorSocialist opinions,and certainly none of them would declare to-day that he had repudiated them What, therefore, do they want? To present again the question of the Republic to universal suffrage, which has three times solemnly condemnedit? That is not serious. To take the oath to the Empire, and by submitting to the constitution honourably to fulfil the mission of deputy? Nobody will believe it. Then, what remains? To endeavour to sow trouble and agitation, to embarrass the action of the Emperor, and to enfeeble, both at home aud abroad, the feehng which all Earope entertains of his power, the prestige with which he has done so much during the last six years for the glory and prosperity of the country. But they will not succeed; their efforts will be shattered against those electoral masses whose good sense and patriotism founded the Empire; it will suffice that these masses present themselves at the ballot. Explain to them well, Moonsieur le Prefet, how they have put the question. One of their journals said that it would be resolved by the country centralized in Pais. Paris will disappoint their hopes, and the 350,000 electors of the department of the Seine will not separate themselves from the 9,000,000 eleotors inscribed in the 85 other departments. Remind those who possess property of the securitr which the Empire has given them-those who labour, of the marvellous conditions of activity created for them-those who suffer,of the incessantanxietyof theEmperoronaecountofthe distress of the people-all of the glorious and respectdpoition to 'which he has reatored our oountry. Ltt them all, therefore, come and give their opinion on affairx which are ther own. They a well aware that the Empir repays ihem with sury in glory and in posperity- that which they give it in confidence and self-devotion. "Repeat to there, Monsieur le Prefet, that their duty as well their intereBsalls them to the balot. Tha verifictioni of their votes will prove that if the enemies of the Empire hoped to find a point of support in the electoral urn they have once more mistaken the power of the bondi which unite tho Emperor to the people, and calumniated universal suffrage. " Receive, Monsdeur le Priet, the urance of my very distinguished consideration. "BILLAUZlT." Notwithstanding the great care evidently bestowed in the preparation of this document, and the talent displayed in its composition, it, nevertheless, exhibits a certain weakness and betrays a fear of a partial defeat at the approaching elections, partLcularly in Paris. It evades the reil question raised between the country and the Government, and seeks to terrify the electors with the shadow of the Republic. 1L Billault asks, "what do the opposition candidates want," and continues with great naivet-, " is it to present again the question of the Republic to universal suffrage, which has three times condemned it I" M. Billault, who must have read the addresses of the opposition candidates, knows perfectly well that the question raised is,-', Have the French people a right to the enjoyment of more liberty than is granted to them by the existing constitution T" This is certinly not a very unreasonable request, particularly in face of the language employed in the averlissement given a few days since to the SiUcle, in which the follownng passage is to be found:-" Considering that the Government of the Emperor is based on the sovereignty of the people and on the principles of 1789, henceforth the indestructible foundations of Frencheociety." It would require all Me. Billault's dexterity to discover any analogy between the existing Imperial constitutioa and the sovereignty of the people and the principles of 1789. A thunder storm burst over Paris last evening, attended with exceedingly heavy rain. Unusually heavy rain also fell the evening before, and coatinued pouring down for upwards of two houru.

RUSSIA. A letter from St. Petersburg, dated the 13th inst., inthe Nord, says:- "I can now announce to you as positive the proximate deDarture of the Emperor. His Majesty will embark on tbe 23d of June for Kiel, with the Empress and the Grand Duke MichaeL The minister for Foreign Affairs, Prince Gortschakoff, Count Adlerberg, and Prince Dolgorouid wil accompany their Majesties. From Kiel their Majesties will proceed to Wildbad and Kissingen, where the Empress wil Sojourn for some time. The Emperor is expected to return to St. Petersburg in July with the Empress-Mother, the Grand Duke 3iohael, and the Princess Cecilia of Baden. In this case the marriage of the Grand Duke will be celebrated at Peterhoff in July." We may add to this announcement that during the trip of the Russian Emperor he will meet his "Brother of France ;" probably in the neighbourhood of Darmnstadt. SAItDRIA. (FROM O11R OWN COBRRsPONDENT.) TURIN, JUNE 16. In the sitting of the Chamber of Deputies yesterday M. Brofferio announced that he wished to interrogate the Ministry regarding the mission of the Cavaliere Boncompagni to Bologna, and this morning, on the opening of the sittig, having been agreed to for the purpose, the Chamber was numerously attended by persons who expected au interesting debate. The discussion commnenced by Md. Brofferio, who said:- " At the beginning of this session I made an interpellation on the Italian question, regretting that great munificence of words was followed by a scarcity of facts. I now have to lament something still more sad. Then it was a case of works left undone; now it is facts that have been accomplished contrary to preconceived hopes. Italy has two enemies-Austria and the Pope-both fatal to her. The Italians, in the midst of their municipal discords, have always a hereditary shudder at the mention of Roms or Vienna. The Emperor of Austria camo and went. Piedmont took no notice of him, and the Government deserves praise for having respected the dignity of Italy. Bat itdid not do the same towards the Pope, who arrived at Bologna amid the joyful acclamations of his own servants. Let the Pope go or come, what does it signify to Piedmont ? If we consider him as Prince he is opposed to Italian liberty; if as head of the Church, he can send us his blessing from Rome as easily as from Bologna. The Ministry bas acted contrary to the wish of the nation in sending the (avaliere Boncompagni to those same Legations for which the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed his diplomatic desire for liberal reforms. If there exists some diversity of opinion in Piedmont we are, at all events, agreed in wishing the independence of the civil laws from the ecclesiastical power. If Count Cavour had considered the laws of civil marriage, the abolition of ecclesiastical tribanals and of convent tithes, the ecclesiastical reforms which the country desires, and which Rome opposes-if he hai reflected on the hostility of Rome, on the anger, on tho protests of the bishops against the Government and the Chamber, on the resistance to sepulture-if he bad remem. bered that the Prince of Rome is the intimate ally of Austria, our enemy, and called Spaniards, French, and Neapolitans to scourge the most illustrious capital in Italy, he would never have sent to compliment the Pope under the auspices of Italian liberty. It may be said that it is sought to compliment the head of the Church, bat you cannot separate the Prince from the head of the Church. They are one body and one mind, and I am not aware that the head of the Church has come to Bologna and that the King has remained at Rome. Nor was it the King of Rome who raised so many difficulties against us, but precisely the head of the Church. If the Cavaliere Boncompagni is returned to Florence (Count Cavour had stated so yesterday when appointing to-day for this discumion), it is as much as to say that he went to Bologna. An allocution of the Pope's calls us faith-breakers, spoliators. overthrowers of sacred things, eoilero of monasteries, Communists and Socialists of the worst description and most pernicious kind, and we make to the Pope humble rever. encees. The fact is grave, and becomes still more so, considering the prosecutions in ecclesiastical matters th3t accompany the Cavaliere Boncompagni, and will cause him to be crowned on his return. In Piedmont, where liberty of consoience exista, and where there are Jewish synagogues and Vaudois temples, and might be Turkish mosques aad Indian pagodas, it is curious that we may not disoass theology without the Fiscal demanding fines and imprisonments, and almost the rigours of the Inquisitioa oven. We have seen the condemnation of the director of the Unione because he quoted the diary of Bureardo, which is printed in Florence, however, and afterwards because he said the Pope was not infallible; the condemnation of the Espero, because it quoted a page of Gurrazzi, wherein mention is made of the miracle of a famous qnttrUped; the condemnation of a priest for his religious opinions; the acquittal of another priest at Duomo d'Ossol3, who had denounced a fellow-citizen from the altar; we have the pleadings In the case of the ass versus, the mule, which wiU pass to posterity in honour of the glorions species; we have had the prosecution of Alessandria against three young men for having in private convors%tion discussed religious subjects. In all this luxury of holy offices the country, seeing the Cavaliere Brncompagni go to Bologna, feared that somethiog against the liberty of the State or some Concordst wasgmeditated. Tho clerical papers rejoice at that proceeding, and the Armonia of yesterday congratulated the Ministry upon it, spoke of the possibility of its being an edifying indication of repentance on the part of Ministers and appeared already tO fore. the muma of a Concordat desceding to purify their many dnx, I beg to be informed if the mission of the Cavalier Doncompagni had any politicd character-ii it were intended to initiate a Concordat against the liberty of the press and the independence of the State. (Cotnt Cavour.-' No.') I accept that as a favoar. able reply. The mission Boncompagni, seeing the tender. ness existing baween Rqme and Austria, may cause suspicion, however, that it may initiate also an accommodation between Turin and Vienna; and I hope the ?dinister will answer on this subject without using cunning little words, or diplomatic phrases of doable meaning. " Coant Cavour said,-The hon. interrogator demand2 frank words from me, and I will give them to him. The mission of the Cavaliere Roneorapagai had no political eharacter, but was simply one of courtesy. Whatever may be the effect of my words, I do not hesitate to say that, not. withstanding the differences between PRomo and Tarin, we have never ceased to respect in the Pope the head of the religion of the immense majority of the citizens. If we have maintained together the rights of the civil power-it we have introduced reforms required by the age, we have never ceased to consider ourselves as forming part of the church, and this sentiment is shared by the immense majority of the nation. For this reason, we thought it very desirable to perform an aot of courtesy and honour towards the Pontiff when he approached our frontier. The Boncompagni mission bad no connexion whatever with the prosecutions to which AL Brofferio has alluded. I first becama aware of those prosecutions through the public journals. The Government remained a strangerto them. The laws repressing crimes of that kind were not made by us. If we had to do so, I, for my own part, should be in favour-of giving the greatest possible breadth of liberty; but, as they pre-exist, it is a duty to execute them. Nor was it in consequence of superfluous zeal on the part of the pablic officers that the sentences of the tribunals had been severer than was demanded by the Fiscal. As to the appEcation of the law I should think it wanting in respect to the magistrature to discass the sentences. For the rest, to tranquilliza hL Broff,rio and the House, I will add that the liberty of the press has not been menaced by me; and I have only to ask for the papers of this morning or yesterday to prove how much freedom they enjoy. In a political sense I hive no gret faith in the efficacy of repressive measures for internal questions. Prosecutions and oondemnations are not effective arms against opinions and doctrines, and if they only have the effect of moderating in some degree the form they will be more profitable to liberty than to relgion. Polemics in religious matters, carried on in pssion and with injuries mixed with arguments, tum to the discredit of liberty. As to the eulogiums of the clerlcal journals, I will say that if the .Armonit has for onoe spoken les ill of me than usual the other papers of that party of Chambery and Genoa were never more violent against the ministry than at the present time. Nor have I any fault to find with them on .this account, since the Ministry oontinues to profess those principles and doctrines which drew downl their anger and hatred in times pas'. With respect to the Concordat, I bave sufficiently replied in saying that the mission was one only of couTtesy. As to reopening relations with a Power with which we have broken off I will add that the Cavaliere Boncompagni was charged to perform an act of deference to the Pope-not to enter into negotiations; and I hope that this wiU be enough to satisfy the hon. member. " ML Brofferio rejoiced to find there was no political mission,l but did not approve even the mission of courtesy. Courtesies in this case were inaulting to the country, and went farther than necessary. He denied that the rights of the State had been maintained. XReform, he said, was incomplete, sinoe for eight years Piedmont has demanded a law on civil marriage, and found coldness in the Government. The prosecutions wou'd never have taken place if the Government had not wished it. The Advocate Fiscal is an officer of the Government7 froma whom he reoeives his instructions, and a circular letter to the Fiscal8 would have sufficed to stop these prosecations. " CountCavour (with animation) exclaimed that no Fiscal Advocate wouald retain office if he were ordered not to execute the law. " Mt. Brofferlo said, -The laws are pieces of paper. (Great aigns and exclamations of dissent.) I am not moved by this disapprobation. I repeat that the law per se is a piece of paper ; it is a dead letter, and has life only when applied. The lawis in the manner of application. One word from the Government would have sufficed to prevent the Fiscals from putting themselves in opposition to the Parliament and the nation. " Me Deforesta, Minister of Grace and Justice, protested against the words of Deputy Brofferio. The Ministry would be censurable were it to prompt transgressions of the laws on the part of those whose duty it is to carry it into execution. " M. Hoia thought that In prosecutions of the press the dispositions were not so defiite and precse as not to admit of individual appreciation. Passlons and convictions influence our judgment. Two advocates of different religions and philosophioal convictions might arrive at different conclusions. He was of opinion, then, that if the Fiscal Advocates knew the Government desired temperance prosecutions and condemnations wonld be rare. "After some further conversation to the same effect i. Brofferio proposed the following order of the day:' The House, welcoming the declaration of the Ministry that the Boncompagni mission had no political signification towards Rome and Vienna,and desirous that liberty of conscience may be respected, passes to the order of the day.' "'This having been opposed by Count Cavour, on the ground that it implied that the acts of Government had caused suspicion of a Conrordat previons to the mission, M. Brofferio modified it to ' the House accepting the explana. tion regarding the P,omcompagni mission,' &c.; but this also was combated by h. Deforesta, wrho said that it conveyed a censure on the magistrature and public officers for applying the Laws as formerly; and after some remarks from the Deputy Asproni hi Brofferio agreed to withdraw his motion, and the subject dropped without ferther result."
CrviL SEEVICE ESTImATS3.-No. 6, published on Friday, refers to " superannuation and retired allowances, and gratuities for charitable purposes." The total amount demanded by the Governmnnt for the current financial year was 239,689L, against 226,1991. in 1856. The items are -- 159,8421. for superannuation and retired aUowances ; 2,0581. for Toulonese and Corsican emigrants, and Americat loyalists; 2,0031. for the vaccine establishment; 3251. for the Refuge for the Destitute; 3,8801. for Polish refugees and distressed Spaniards; 4,281U for miscellaneous charges (formerly Civil List); 2,8951. for inftrmaries in Ireland; ,9851. for the Westmoreland Lock Hospital in Dablin ; 900. for the Rotunda Lying.in Hospital in Dublin ; 4001. for the Coombe Lying-in Hospital in Dablin; 7,6001. for the House of Industry Hospital in Dublin; 3,1001. for the Cork-street Fever Hospital in Dublin ; 6001. for tho Dublin Meath Hospital; 2001. for the St. Mark's Ophthalmic Hospital in Dablin; 1,0851. for Dr. Steevens's Rospital in Dublin; 6,3371. for the Irish Concordatum Fund, &c., and 39,0541. for Irish non-conforming and other mainisters. THE NETLEY flospiTAu.-A meeting of gentlemen connected with the medical profession practiaing in Southampton was held at the Audit-house on Thursday evening to consider the statements recently made in reference to the alleged unhealthiness of the site select-ed for the Netley Hospital, and was attended by the mayor (Mr. J. White) and nearly all the physicians and surgeons resident in Southampton.. Dr. Oke was in the chair. The chairman said that during nearly 30 years' practice he had never seen more than one decided case of ague, and that was imported. Dr. Osborn denied that the localities in the vicinity of the site were so unhealthy as had been alleged. Intermittent fever and ague were so rare in the district that during 17 or 18 years' practice he had not had one case of fever per year on the average. Dr. Osborn then read some statistics to show that for some years past the duration of life in the district was lengthy on the average. Dr. W. Bullar said that during 20 years he had not known any malarious disease engendered in the town. Mr. H. Dusautoy, surgeon, took a similar view, and said that the Registrar's returns proved that the mortality of Southampton was less than that of other large towns. He believed that the Government could not have done better, or selected a more healthy position for the hospital, and that Southampton was a very health town. There was not a single medical man, he believed, who would say that Government bad acted wrongly in the selection of the site. Several other medioal gentlemen having supported these views, resolutions were agreed to unanimously similar in effeet to that adopted at the meeting of the Southampton Medical Somiety, which was published in The 27me8 of Thursday, and a committee appointed to prepare a memorial to the Government setting forth the facts in answer to the charges which have been made as to the unhealthinmss of the Netley site. The proceedings closed with votes of thanks to the Mayor for the promptitude with which he had acted in this matter, and to Dr. Oke for his conduct in the chair. Two MBN KILLED BY LIGRTNING.-In the past week the atmosphere in Berkshire was greatly charged with electricity, and on the afternoon of Tnesday an awful thunderstorm occurred in the neighbourhood of Inkpen, which is situated a few miles only from the town of Hungerford, in Berkshire. Three men, named Martin, Buxey, and Palmer, were employed in mowing the grass on the lawn of Kirby-house, the residence of Mr. J. Butler, on Tuesday afternoon, and when a storm of thunder and lightning broke over the place one of them suggested that they should run beneath a tree. Martin, knowing that trecs cenerally attracted lightning, immediately remarked, " We had better go anywhere than under a tree." Buxey and Palmer, however, as the storm was severe, and the hail was falling heavily at the timne, ran and seated themselves beneath a large lime tree, but Martin walked off to a cottage, and was safely sheltered. In about half an hour after the storm had abated both Buxey and Palmer were found lyimg on the grass beneath the tree, quite dead, the electric fluid having firat struck the upper part of the tree, then descended it, and laid prostrate the two men vrho were sitting thers. The clothes of Busey were found to be on fire. The melancholy event has excited painful interest in the neighbourhood, especially as one of them has left a widow and five children wholly unprovided for. An inquest has been held on tbe bodies, and the jury returned a verdict in accordance with the facts adduced. The hair of Palmer, when his body 'as removed, 'was observed to have been much aoorched.
LAW 1ZEPOBr. | COURT OF QMEN'S BENCE, WnMsT= JUNE 20. BETTS V. MRNZtFS At) AWrn'mnV (.N=ung8 at AitS PrtuMU, OeCOreL CAMPBELL and a Speoial Jury,.) Sir F. Kelly, Mr. stacaulay, Q.C., Mr. Uda71, Mr. Webster, and Mkr. Milward appeared for the plaintiff; r BL Smith. Q.C., Mr. Hindmarch, and .3r. J. Brown for the defendants. The trial of thig cause, which occupied the Court all Friday and Saturday, was not brought to a close until a late hour. The plaintiff, W. Betts, sued the defendants, R. D. Menzies and T. Wildey, to recover damages for the infinge. ment of a patent granted to the plaintiff on the 13th of January, 1849, for "a new manufacture of capsules, and ot a material to be employed therein, and for other purposes.' The defendants, among other objections, denied the novelty of the alleged invention, and aso said that there was no due smecification of it. It appeared that the plaintiff was ona of four sons of the late Mr. Betts, the inventor of Betts's British brandy. The manufacture of brandy was carried on at Smithfield; b*at there was also a manufactory in Wharf-road, City-road, at which 1r. Betts manufactured "capsules" and "tinfoil,"; under several patents which be had taken out. 3r. Betts died in the year 1847; but, previous to his death, he had transferred his business to his four sons. Previous to the 13th of January, 1849, "capsules" and "tinfoil" were made entirely of tin, a metal which is five times as dear as) lead, but, towards the latter end of the year 1848, it' accurred to Mr. W. Betts, the plaintiff, to endeavour to mako them of lead coated with tin. In making his experiments he laid a plate of tin on a plate of, lead, and passed them between the rollers. He found that, after being subjected to this operation, the' plates partially cohered; and, having repeated the operation several times, he eventually proved that lead and tin could be mechaniclly united by heavy pressure into one substance,. A plate of tin was then pl ced on each side of a plateof lead, the two platesof tin beng together1-10th and the lead 9-10ths of an inch in thickness and the plates being thus rolled out produced a broad ribend of lead, coated on both sides with a brilliant surface of tin inca pable of being acted upon by acids. Thenewmetth produced was then cut into disks and manufactured into capsules. An article was thus produced which was not only 72 per cent. cheaper than the tin capsules, but was more flexible and convenient in use; and, being coated with tin on both sides, the capsues had the briliantappearance of tin andwereperfectly "unpoisonous? The plaintiff completed his discovery on the 27ih of November, 1848, and the next day he petitioned the Crown for a patent, but some little delay took place on the part of the officers of the Crown, so that the patent wa not sealed till the 13th of January, 1849. As soon as the invention became known, the capsules, from the reduced price, came at once into very general use, not only in this country, but on the continent; the netw "tinfoil" or "Belts's metal" also came into extensive use in a variety of ways. It appeared, however, that soon afterwards the brothers began to dispute about the patent; and that, while the plaintif claimed it as his exclusive property, the other brothers claimed a joint interest in it. The defendant menzies, had been foreman of the capeule manufactory, and so had become acquainted with the plaintiff's process; but, on the 9th of August, 1849, he was dismissed from the plaintiff's service, A few weeks afterwards he went over to Belgium, and became acquainted with the other defendant, 'Wildey, who has now a manufactory at Malines, where he manufactures capsules according to a mode which the 'plaintiff alleged was an infringement of his patent of January 13, 1849. The defendant, Menzies, in October, 1850, returned to England. In the meantime the plaintiff and his brothers had become involved in a Chancery suit on the subject of the patent. The defendant Mlenzies then entered the employ of the brothers; and in the Sear 1852 a suggestion was made by him in Chancery that the plaintiffs patent was void, because, as he (Menzies) Paid, in theinterval between the petition for the patent, the 28th of November, 1848. and the grant of the patent on the 13th of January, 1849, the plaintiff had sold a large number of capsules to the public made of the new metal. In the year 1852 an action at law was directed by the Court of Chancery to be tried between the plaintiff and his brotbers with respect to the validity of the plaintiffs patent; but the action and all the Cbsncery proceedings were referred to a barrister, Mr. Bigg8 Andrews, who in 1856 made his award, under which the plaintiff retained the patent, and was directed to pay his brothersfrom 2,000. to 3,0001. Duringthese proceedings the defendant, Menzies, was the adviser and witness of the plaintifr'sbrothers - but he subsequently renewed his connexion with lr. Wildey, the other defendant. In the year 1854 Wildey took out a patent in Belgium for making capsules in a manner similar to that described in the plaintiff's patent, but expressed, as Sir F. Kelly observed, in more simple and comprehensive language. Lord CA'mI.im said, that in Belgium they followed the French forms, which were in general moen admirable, both for simplicity and precision. The mode of manufacture adopted by Wildey was described as being a clear piracy of the plaintiff's invention, though he alleged that the articles which he imported into this country, and which the defendant Menzies had sold, were not made according to the plaintiff's method, but according to a method patented by a MIr. Dobbs in this country so far back as the years 1804 and 1820. The plaintiff's witnesses said that Dobbs's patent was not identical with the plaintifl's, the chief difference relied upon being that in the plaintiff's patent the proportionate thickness of the metals was specified, whereas in Dobbs's patent of 1804 the metals wereto be ' of equal or unequal thicknesses." Evidenoc was given to show that Dobbs patent had never been brought into use at all. Several witnesses employed in Wildey's manufactory were brought over, and, according to their evidence, the capsules made by them in his manufactory, and which were proved to have been imported into London and consigned to Menzies, were made in precisely the same method as that described in the plaintiff's specification. At the close of the plaintiffs case, Mr. M. SMITH submitted that there was no evidence of infringement, and that the plaintiff's specification was bad. Lord CQAmBEUL said, hethoughtDobbe's patent wasgood, as far as it went; but it was not the same as Betts's. His Lordship said he should hold that the plaintiffs specification was good, and that there was evidence for the jury. Mr. SIITri, on the part of the defendants, contended, first, that the plaintift's patent was clearly bad, for there was no novelty in it, the precise method adopted by him being that specified by Dobbs in 1804; and, secondly, there was no infringement, for the capsules imported into London by the defendant had been made under Dobbs's patent of 1820 by fusion. It appeared that the plaintiff, in his specLfication, claimed,- thai, the manufacture or the new material, lead combined with I on one or both of it3 surfaces, by rol£ing or other mechanical pres- mure, axhercin dmesbcbed: and, setcoy, the imanulmet,s of capaules of the new inaterial of lead and tta combined by mechanical pressure, as herenu describedal Dobba's patent for making "Albion metal" was dated the 10th of zSeptember, 1804, and consisted,- " In plating, coating, or unitiog lead with Un, and also thelr variou alloys or,rmlxtarea, a. the case may require, whictL when done I denominate Albion metas. and which I apply to the manufacture of cisternP, liuinga for cisterns, covering and gutters for buildings, beilers, vats, and Iniugs, colln furniture, worms for distillers, and such other things as require to be maie of a flexible, a wholesome, or a cheap nmet.llic sub,tauoe.

Both the defendauts wvre examined at great length insIaport of this view, but in the course of the evidence it ajpeared from a letter wnitten by Menzies to Wildey that neither of them knew anything about Dobbs's patent until a veryrecent period, and that on making the discovery they were advised that they couldsafelyimporethe articles intoEngland. A great dealof evidence wasgiven byMenziestoshow thatbeforethe date of the plaintiff' patent he had sold a large number of capsules made of his new metal, and this evidencewas supported by entries made in the books by Menzies, and showing by the weight that the goods in question must have been of the new metal, which was heavier than the old. But, on cross-examination, it appeared that two of these entries had been made on erasures, and from the addingup it appeared that the original entries must have corresponded exactly with the weight of the oldmetal, which consisted of tin only. Ifir. M. SBiux having summed up the defendants' evidence lMir. MACAUTLAY replied upon the whole case. Lord CASIrBELL, in summing up the evidence, made some observations which were not very favourable to the defendants' proceedings, and observed that the courso taken was a hardship on the plaintiff; but still that consideration must not determine the case, but the jury must say, upon the evidence, whether or not there bad been an infringement. The jury found a verdict for thoplaintiff onall the Issues, but the defendant obtained leave to move to enter the verdict in his favour. SECOND COURT, (Before Mfr. ruSUice WIGHTIrAH and a Specio4 Jury.) LE NEVE V. TEIE V)ESTRY OF THE HAMLET OF MIE-END OLD TONVN. This was an action of trespas. The declaration alleged that the defendants had entered on certain land of ehe plaintiff, situate in front of the Earl Grey tavern, Mtile-endroad, and pulled down and removed a shed and several seats and forms. The defendants pleaded-first, not guilty; secondly, that the land was not the plaintiff's; thirdly, that the banilet of Mile-end was a district under the Metropolis Local Management Act; that the land in question was a street within the district; that the sbeds, seats, and forms were an obstruction to the passage of it, and they removed them after due notice to the plaintiff. Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Phion, and Mr. Turner were couneel for the plaintiff; Mr. Edwin James, Mr. Colier, Mr. M'Iantye, and Mr. Powell for the defendants. Sir P. TniEsiciER stated that the action was brought to .try the right of the vestry to remove a shed and sats placed in front of the plainff's house, of whick he Ibecame tens it in 1854 under Mo%. Charrington, Head, and Co., the brewers.

SBone time after the passing of the M eO r Locl Management Act th. vestry erved a notioeen te plaintiff requiring him to remove thi abed, and s he Wined to do so suanoaned him before Mr. YardlY, Who, however, consi3,ered there wa a bondJfdc claim of itle , antd refused to adjudicate, but recommtdd the vestry to bring an indictment; they however deciald to do so, bat sent a nurnbet of raen who removed thte whole structure, and threw a quantity of gravel on tie place. Thie plaintiff was therefore c-ompelled to l*iu'g this action to esablish his light. Theprincipal point for the juy wbather the land in question was part of te e highway.

Mr. Overend and Mr. D.yle were counsel for the plain. tiffs; Mr. James and Mr. filkinson appeared for the defendant. This was an action against the London and County Bank to recover damages for neglecting to honour certain bills of exchange, in answer to which the defendants paid 1.0. into court. The facts of the case were not of any public importance, and it may suffice to say that the jury found a verdict for the defendants on the only question raised by the pleadings -namely, the sufficiency of the suni paid into court, o)u accompanied that verdict by the expression of their opinion that the defendants had been guilty of negligenc iln the matter. JACKSOW V. ARMSTTRO.NG Mr. Petersdorff and Mr. Garth appeared for the plalntiff Mr. hL Chambers and Mr. Russell were counsel for the defendant. The plaintiff is the proprietor of the Eyde Pak Hotel, Oxford-street, and this was an action to reoove from the defendant the sum of 2161., being the balance of a bill incurred by Mrs. Armstrong at that house, from May to November, 1856. It aDpeared from the evidence of the plaintiff and his wife that Mrs. Amstrong wa introduced to the hotel by Mr. Poulden, now acting as the attorney of the defendant, her husband, when the best apart-ents in the establishment were engaged, and arrangements made for the board and lodging of herself and her maid at 16 guineas per week, exclusive of wine and spirits, which WAs reduced to 12 guineas when the season had advanced. DariDg the residence of hirs. Armstrong at the laint's house the defendant paid her a visit, living and sleeping with her as her husband, and on his departure expressed his thanks to the plaintiff and his wife for their great kindness and attention to his 'wife, and vwishes that she should have everything 8els required. A fter that he wrote to the plalintiff for a favourite swordstick wPhich hc had left behind him, and another letter in which he authorized him not to allow two persons whom he named to have acoce to Mr. Armstrong.

The question raised was one arising upon the construction of a cla.se in the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, sections 93 and 94. The question was whether when lands were proposed to be divided bya railway and a small portion was left on one side, less than half anacre, and the claimant required the company to make a communication to connect that small portion with the rest of his property, and the expense of doing so was larger than the value of the small portion of land, the company were not entitled to give a notice requiring the owner to sell the land to them. The piece of land in the present case was worth 1001., and making the communication would cost 5801. WVhen the case came on for trial there was a verdict for the plaintiff.

PREROGATIVE COURT, SATUBUDAY, JUXE 20. IN THE GOODS OF PPRTR RA TVI *e T 7erore Wr JOHN DODRnn.I In this case there was a novel application to the Court under the foUowiag circumstances. Peter Rainier died on the 13th of April, 1836, leaving a will and one codioil, whereby his widow E. C. Rainier, John Rainier, and John Bowler were appointed executors and trustees. After giving legacies to his wife and executors 'he bequeathed the residue of his personal estate thus .-as to one moiety, the interest to his wife for life, and at her I death, the principal absolutely to his daughter Caroline Rainier on certain contingencies, which happened ; the other mnoietv he ';equeathed to his executors, hi trust, to pay the interest to Caroline Rainier for life, and on her marriage to &sttle the same for her separate use for life, and at her death the principal thereof to her children, subject to certain provisoes. Irs. Rainier, the widow, alone proved the will and codicil, and acted in the execution of the trusts thereof. Caroline Rauiner wasmarried to Mr. Ebenezer Jones, on the oth of July, 1841; by their marriage settlement she, with his consent, assigned the first-mentioned moiety to trustees forthe benefit of such of her brothers and sisters as should survive their mother. They were Peter Rainier ancd Ellen Catherine Rainier, spinster, afterwards wife of W. Yolland. In the marriage settlement the other moiety of the residuary estate was not mentioned. Mrs. Rainier, as acting trustee, continued to hold the trust funds until her death on the 31st of October, 1852. In May, 1853, letters of administration (with the will and codicil annexed) of the estate of Peter Rainier left unadministered by Mr Rainier were granted to Mrs. Jones on her exhibiting an inventory and account, and her sureties justifying to the amount of a moiety of the deceased's unadministered estate, and the usual administration bond was iven by her husband and by William Pottinger and Archibald Weir as sureties. As these two gentlewen, who were the solicitors of the parties, required from Mr. Jones some security to cover their responsibility as such sureties, he by indenture dated the 19th of April, 1854, directed, limited and appointed an estate called Knolton-hall, belonging to him, to hold to them for a term of 1,00U years upon trust and as an indemnity for any losses they might be put to by reason of their suretyship, with a proviso that on the per. formance of the trusts the term should cease and determine. In May, 1855, on petition to the (Court of Chancery of Mr. and Mrs Jones and the other parties interested, an order of that Court was made appointing H. P. Jones and the Rev. A. Jones trustees of the estate of Peter Rainier, deceased. Elis estate, left and administered by Mrs. Rainier, consists of the stock and moneys set forth in an inventory Irought in and sworn to by Mrs. Jones. Of the residue she as paid the one moiety to her brother and sister, pursuant to the covenant of her marringe settlement, and the other moiety she has paid over to the new trustees appointed b the Court of Chcery, in trust for herself and her shildren, as directed by the deceased's will, and by an in. denture of release dated the 26th day of May, 1855, those parties have respectively certified to have received the sums of money and stock therein and in the said inventory mentioized, forming together the deceased's estate heretofore unadministered, and have acquitted and discharged Mrs. Jones as administratrix therefrom. So that the estate has now been fully administered, and Mrs. Jones has duly made, sworn to, and brought in an account showing her distribution thereof. Mr. Jones died on the 20th of January last, leaving a will, in vhich Mrs. Jones was named executrix. As such she now desres to sell the estate of Knolton-hall, for which purpose it is important that the term of 1,000 years created therein for the benefit of Messrs. Pottinger and Weirshould cease and determine, and be reassigned to attend the inheritance of the estate; but it appears that they decline to reassign it on the ground that the bond to which they became sureties is still in force. Dr. Phillimore, therefore, mioved that the account brought in by Mrs. Jones might be ailowed and confirmed by the Court, and that Mrs. Jones Siri ht be discharged from further suits in respect thereof cmd twit the bend given by her husband and his sureties aight be declared void and of nene effect. He admitted that he had no e recedent, but contended that as it clearly appeared that the estate had been duly and fully administered it was therefore competent to the Court to declare the bond given under the statutes to be bow void and of none effect. He referred to the cases of but Ea hev. Skolton lo (3 Haggard, 782), and " the Arch. bishop of Canterbury v. Ta pen" (8 B. ard C., 154). Sir JoH Don sosa ountwho ret he had no power whatever to comply with the latter part of the prayer and to pronounce the bond void. Tho Ecclesiastical Cjourts did not even assume to determine the question of the forfeituro of such beonds, but left that to the decision of the court-s of common law, and confined themselves to the exercise of a discretion as to allowing the bands to be given out for the purpose of beinig sued upon. He declined to pronounce the bond void. but said he would lcok through the papers, and, if satisfied that all the parties interested were before the Court, and that Mrs. Joness paceount was correct, he would comrply with the other part of the prayer by allowing and confirming that acrcount.

CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, Fridcay, June 19. OLD COTTR'T' (Before Mr. Baron CH&NNELL.) John Hind May, 33, warehouseman, and William Taylor and George David Myers, who surrendered to take their trial, were charged with a misdemeanour in having unlaw. fully conspired together to obtain a large quantity of goods by faba pretences from Thomas Gorman and Alexander Lawson. Mr. Giffard and mr. Poland conducted the prosecution; Mr. Serieant Ballantine and Mr. Huddleston appeared specially, with Mr. Monk, for the defendant Taylor; Mr. Hawkins appeared specially, with Mr. Sleigh, for Myers; and Mr. Robimson appeared for the other defendant, May. This case occupied the Court a great many hours on Friday, and was not brought to a conclusion until Saturday afternoon, and the evidence was of a somewhat complicated and intrica.- character. It appeared from a very lucid opening by the learned counsel for the prosecution that the prosecutors were manufacturers of Irish cambric handkerchiefs at Lurgan, in Ireland, and that Mr. Gorman, whose case was the principal one relied on, had been deprived of his goods under the following circumatances:-It seemed that in February last Mr. Gorman had come to London, bringing with him some samples of handkerchiefs which he was desirous to dispose of, and he applied to Taylor, whose business it was to act as agent in such inatters, to assist hima in effecting a sale with some of the London warehonsemen, and he consented to do so; and the samples were left with him, and Mr. Gorman returned to Ireland. Very shortly afterwards he received a letter from Taylor, in which he stated that he could dispose of the handkerchiefs to May, who carried on business as a warehonseman and commisslon agent in Huggin-lane, upon certain terms. Mr. Gorman made inquiry, the result of which was that he wrote to Taylor, and distinctly told him that he would not have any dealings with May, and that he declined to trust that per son. Several communications took place between the parties; and on the 19th of March Taylor wrote to Mr. Gorman, and informed him that he had an offer for tho goods from Messrs. Myers and Co., formerly of Ludgate-hiD, and that they were very respectable people, aad he advised Mr. Gorman to close with their offer. The prosecutor, in consequence of this, agreed to supply handkerchiefs or different qualities to the amount of 64n., and it wvas arranged that he was to receive 1001. in cash, and the re mainder in biUs bearing the acceptance of Myers and Co. The goods were despatched to London, and the defendant Taylor acknowledged the receipt of them, and said he had delivered them; and at the same time said that Myers and Co. were not quite satisfied with the price of some of the goods, and that he had been obliged to make a small deduc. tion, andhewouldremit thecashandthebiDs onthe folowing Friday. On the 7th of April it appeared that Taylor wrote again to the prosecutor, remitting him a check for 1001. and at the same time stating that Myers and Co. repudiated the bargain, and that May had turned out an " out and oat" villain, and that he had intercepted the goods and sold them and run away with the money. The prosecutor, who up to this time had not the least idea that May had anything to do with his goods, immediately came up to London and went to the countlng-house of the defendant Taylor, and inquired of him how it happened that May had become possessed of the goods when he had distinctly refused to accept him as the purchaser? and Taylor replied that Mlay had come to his warehouse and taken away the goods without his consent, that he had in fact stolen them, and that he ought to be hanged. An appointment was subsequently made for May to come and give some explanation, but he did not do so, and the advice of counsel was taken as to whether under the circumstances the defendant Myers could be made cvilly liable, but it was found that this could not be done, and the further inquiries that were made led to the conclusion that all the defendants had combined together to defraud Mr. Gorman of his property, and that the pretended sale to Myers and Co. was merely a device to obtain possession of the goods. The learned counsel said he should be in a position to show that the moment tho goods arrived in London they were opened in the presence of May and Taylor, and Myers gave written orders for them, and almost immediately after. wards they were dispsed of by May to Messrs. Meeking and Co., of Holborn, for very little more than half the price at which they could be manufactured; and he said there would be very little doubt that the money vas shared between the parties, and, at ali events, he should be in a position to show that immediately after the sale a check for 1001. and another for 0lO were paid into Myers' bankers by May to his credit. The result of all these proceedings was that the prosecutor lost the whole of the property he had consigned to the defendant Taylor; and, when the jury had heard all the facts of the case, it would be for them to say whether the whole proceeding was not a trick to indace the prosecutor to part with his property in order that the defenaants might get it into their possession and dispose of it in the manner stated. He should show that for several days before the goods arrived May had gone to Taylor's warehouse and made inquiries whether any packages had arrived from Ireland, and that immediately on their arrival he was sent for by Taylor and they both examined the goods, and they were at onoe removed to May's warehouse; and he shold likewise prove that May and Taylor were on the most intimate terms; that they had for a considerable time had offices in the same house, and that they had the same private residence, and must have been well acquainted with each other's affairs; and these facts would no doubt asdst the jury in coming to a condusion. These were the principal facts of the case of Mr. Gorman, and with regard to that of Mr. Lawson the facts were somewhat different, but as he should not rely much upon this portion of the charge he should merely inform them that through the agency of Taylor a very large quantity of goods was consigned to May, whom he must have known was at the time in insolvent circumstances, and they were disp ed of by him to Mr. Meeking, as in the case of Mr. Gorman, at little more than half their original price. Mr. T. Gorman, the prosecutor, was then examined.-He said he was a manufacturer of cambric handkerchiefs at Lurgan, Ireland, and ho detailed the circumstances, as above narrated, under which he consented to send the goods to the defendant Taylor. The value of the goods he sent, after deducting the agreed discount and all charges, was 6471. 14s. 8d. Upon receiving information that May had obtained possesson of his property and disposed of it, he came to London and saw Taylor and inquired of him how he came to let May have the goods, and he said that May came to his office and took them away while he was out. Mr. Turner, a solicitor. came in while he was there, and Mr. Lawson, who had accompanied witness, asked whether a magistrate would not compel Messrs. Meeking to give up the goods, as they had bought then at such a low price ? Mr. Turner said it was not a case for a magistrate. Mr. Drew, an accountant, who was representeod to be acting on behalf of May, came into the office soon afterwards, and handed him and Mr. Lawson a paper each, saying it was their account with Mr. May. Witness told him he did not know Mr. May, and his goods were not sold to him. Drew then undertook to produce May on the following Monday at Mr. Turner's office, and they went there, but he did not come. Taylor then asked him what he intended to do, and he said he should take counsel's opilion before he proceeded further, and they ali went to Mr. rentis's chambers in the Temple, and the facts were stated to him to have his opinion whether Myers was liable or not to pay for the goods He did not show him the letters, but upon the facts that were stated to him Mr. Prentis sad he thought there were some strong points in the case. (A laugh.) on thel16th of April heowent to Myers's house at Islin ton, and served a notice upon him demanding i the bils that te had undertaken to give in payment for the goods. He had previously seen Myers on the l3th of April, | and told him he bad come for the money for his handkerchiefs, and he admitted that he had made an offer for the goods, and said that if he had got them he would have paid for them, and at the same time threatened that he would make an exposure of the proceedings that were going on between Taylor and May, and said that he knew a great deal of their doings, and that Taylor keptlMay in his house and had part of the same warehouse with him. Taylor accompanied him to Myers's houseupon this occasion, bat he remained outside, and when they were returning in a cab he told Taylor that he considered he was concerned in the fraud that had been practised upon him; and Taylor replied that i he did not take proceedings against him he would give him everything in his house, even to the value of thebed he was lying on, and he also said that he was going into another line of business-the shipping trade, and that he would do business with witness upon more favourable terms than with any other firm Cross-examined by Serjeant BALLANTINE.-Taylor was a stranger to him in February, but he was recommended to go to him by a gentleman of great respectability in Irelaud, who gave him a letter of introduction to hhn. Witneess bad shown the goods to other houses before he left them with Taylor, and ho received a letter from him, stating that his Lurgan friends had glutted the market with similar goods or he should have been able to disposo of them more advantageously. He asked Taylor to tell him how May got possession of the goods, and he said that he came and took them away while he was out, and that he should be hanged. (A laugh.) Serjeant BALLANTIN;-I soppose that is English for ought to be hanged. You don't mean to say that Taylor said May should be hanged ? (Renewed laughter.) Witne88.-Ee supposed Taylor meant that May ought to be hanged for his conduct in respect of the goods. Taylor's clerk told him that May had come twice to his offmee before the goods arrived to inquire about them, and that he said he wanted the invoice to show to Myers. There was a consultation as to whether civil proceedings should not be taken against Myers, and Taylor at first appeared anxious to render them all the assistance in his power, but afterwards he seem3d averse to any legal proceedings being taken. Taylor spoke very indignantly of the conduct of May and Myers in the transaction. He did not believe he was quite sober when the conversation he referred to took place between them. He was not exactly due sober." What he meant by thst expression was that he might ha,vebeen about a-quarter drunk. (A laugh.) He becameratheraffectionate. (Laughter.) Taylor repeatedly sad that if he had been swindled at allhe hadbeen swindled by May and Myers, and that he had nothing to do with it, and he would sell his bed to punish Myers, and would render all the assistance 1n his power to punish them. The witness then stated that he had ascertained that May was worth nothing, but he said that Myers he had no doubt was a wealthy man. He added that he had taken the present pxoeedings against the defendants by the advice of his frinmds in Ireland, and that they had submnribed towarde.defraying the expeses. Jn answer to quections put by I;r. HA)vyaXS tho pro- secutor said that he never saw MyeTsuntil the 13th of April and he had not had any correspondence with him. HIe sen the goods to London solely upon Taylor's order, and Myers told him that he bad never seen them, and that he was out of town when they arrived, and he believed he was at Rinsgate on the 28th of March, the day on which the goods arrived in London. If Myers had paid him he shotld Of course have been perfectly satisfied, and should not have instituted any of these proceedings. He first gave May and Taylor into custody and Myers attended voluntarily. Mr. Alexander Lawson, also a bandkerchief manufacturer at Lurgan, deposed that, by order of Taylor, he supplied a quantity of handkerchiefs that were sold to May subsequently, and he received his checks and bills for the amount. The first transaction was completed in due course, and the bills that were given were naid when they arrived at maturity. He subsequently received a bill for 2001., and another for 1844 in payment for other goods. Both these bills were accepted by May, and the latter was paid, but the 2001. bil was disbonoured. He subsequently received a check of May's for 2001., and this was also dishonoured. This was on the 31st of March. He afterwards received n letter from Taylor, in which he said that he was almost mad in consequence of May's conduct - that he had tried to find him but could not - and he had ascertained that he had intercepted the goods of Mr. Gorman and other people and sold them, and that he bad got 2,0001. or 3,0001. Taylor in this same letter offered to do all m his power to discover May, and said that he was " completely done up" by the knowledge of the misery he had caused. On the 25th of April he received another letterfromTalor, in which ho stated that the opinion of counsel had beezt taken as to Myers's liability, and he advised that a sub. scription should be entered into to try the question. The witness said that he subsequently came over to England with Mr. Gorman, and he confirmed his evidence with regard to what took place at Taylor's counting-house, and stated that he also heard Taylor say that ay took the goods from his warehouse while he was absent, and that he should or ought to be hanged. By Serjeant BALLANTINE.-Taylor offered to guarantee payment for all the goods that were supplied through him, if he would give him a commission of 4 per cent. HIe considered, however, that his guarantee would not have been worth anything. A gentleman named M'Culloch first introduced Taylor to him by letter. Mr. M'Culboch was a very respectable man. The first transaction between him and May took place in the autumn cf 1856. The amount was 287. 6s., and it was paid. The next was for 3841., and 1841L of that amount was paid. By Mr.Ronmso. -May's name appeared as the purchaaer of the goods in all the transactions. Re-examined.---U n one occasion he had a conversation with May, and he to)I him that the money that was the produce of the sale of Gorman's goods had gone to Myors, and that he charged 7L 10s. for the loan of the 100h that vas sent to Mr. Gorman. David Owen, a lad in the service of the defendant, Taylor, said, he remembered some cases that had come from Ireland being brought to the countinghouse on the 28th of March. Taylor was not there when they first came, but he arrived just as the Inst case was being delivered, and he then told him to go to May's countinghouse and inform him that the goods had arrived, and he did so. May came to tb. oeuntinghouse while the Cases were being unpacked, and Taylor was present part of the time. He heard May say something about Eending the goods to Myers, and also something about a cart, and he went awav, and shortly after. wards a cart came and took away the whole of the goods, and Taylor was present when they were removed. May had been at Taylor's warehouse on several days before the 28th of March to see if there were any letters from Ireland. He knew the defendant Myers, but he had only seen him at Taylor's countinghouse upon one occasion. By Serjeant BLLANTnM -A great quantity of goods of all kinds used to come to the warehouse, and Taylor appeared to be doing a large business. Mr. James Dolphin said, he was in the service of the defendant May, and he formerly had an office in Church. passage, Gresham-street, in the same house with Taylor, and he removed from t,here to Huggin-lane. They both lived in the same private residence in iimlico. He remembered being sent by May on the 28th of March to Taylors countinghouse to unpack some goods, and the same goods were afterwards removed to Huggin-lane, to May's countinghouse. Myers was very frequently at May's countinghouse both before and after the r*emoval of these good4 and he came on the Wednesday after they had been disposed of to Messrs. Meeklng. The defendant Myers used to come to the conntinghouse almost every day, and he sat at the same desk with May, and while he was there witness was gene. rally asked to withdraw. By Mr. HAwKNs.-He did not know that Myers had been in the habit of lending money to May. He was awaze that he had carried on business at Ludgate-hill as MyeIs and Co. Re-examined.-The business carried on by Myers at Lud. gate-hill was that of a card printer. George Jurey, a clerk in May's service, deposed that on Monday, the 30th of March, he and May went to Messrs. Meekiing's, Holborn, with a sample of the pmecutor's goods, and they sold the whole of them, except a very small quantity. They were all delivered on the 30th and 31st of March, and he received checks and gold to the amount of 4091. 14s. 6d. from Messrs. Meekin in payment. The invoices for the goods were made out by may, and they were headed "J. H. May, general commission agent." The witness said that he afterwards saw May draw a check for 501. in favour of Myers, and another for 1001., and he paid both these checks into the Union Bank, who were Myers's bankers, to his credit, and he did so by May's direction. Witness was paid 114. as his commission out of the transaction. When May was absent he used to leave out the key of his desk for Myers. The witness then went on to prove that the goods that were received from Mr. Lawson were also sold by May to Messrs. Meeking at about the same rate as thoeo of Mr. German. In answer to questions put by the pri.oners' counsel the witness eaid, that Myers was at Ramnsgate at this time, and he wrote to him to inform him that he had paid inthe cheeks to his banker's. He also stated that the goods were offered to other houses,before they were sold to Wr. Meeking, at the same price, but they would not have them, and that the market for this particular description of a-ticles was completely glutted at the time. John Woodward proved that in 1851 May was a bankrupf, and the counsel for the prosecution proposed to show the condition of his affairs at that time, but upon an objection by the counsel for the defendant that such evidence was n,t legally admissble, the inquiry was not proceeded with. Mfr. Gormanwas re-called, and he statedthatthemanufacturing value of the goods that had been sold by May to Messrs. Meeking for 4091. was 6471. 14s. 8d. Middleton, a police-constable, was called to speakto a conversation he had with the defendant Myers, in which be stated that he had given Taylor a check for 81l. 10s., becaw e he said he was " hard up" for money, and this closed tte case for the prosecution. Serjeant BALLANTIN then made a most Powerful address to the jury on behalf of the defendarit Taylor. He characterized the present proceeding against him as nothing but a cruel persecution, and said that the prosecutors were not actuated by a desire for justice, but merely sought to gratify their personal feelings, and rovenge themselves upon him for the loss of their property. He then proceeded to endeavour to show that Taylor had done nothing more than any other honest broker in the city of London would have done, and said he thought he had good grounds for complaining that he should have been plhaced in his present position while the Messrs. Meeking, w o had purchased these goods so much under their real value, were salved over as respectable people. (This observation caused a burst of applause from persons in the court.) The learned serjeant then proceeded to comment with his usual ability and eloquence upon the facts of the case, and particularly dwelt upon the entire absence of any evidence to show that Taylor, supposing any fraud had in point of fact been committed, had received a single far. thing of the result of that fraud, and said that it appeared he had not even been paid the miserable commission to which he would have been entitled for effecting the sale of these goods. He went on to argue that there was an absence of evidence of fraud, and saia it was admitted that Myers WaS a wealthy and responsible person, and that Taylor was perfectly justified in recommending him to Mr. Gorman as a purchaser, and he was not in any way responsible for the manner in which they were aEterwards dealt with by A great number of witnesses of the utmost respectability were caUed to speak to Taylor's character, and they all described him as a man of high honour and integrity. At seven o'eclock onrFidayevening the trial was adjourned tothe following morning, but it being a case of misdeuneanour the jury were not locked up, as is usual in charges of felony, but were allowed to go to their own homes, the learnedajudge requesting them not to have conversation or communication with any one upon the subject of the trial. SATURDAY, June 20. The proceedings of the trial were resumed this morning, when a number of additional witnesses were examined to speak to Taylor's character. Mr. RonaNsoN then proceeded to address the jury on behalf of May, sad argued, with a good deal of ingenuity and ability, that there was not sufficient evidence to show that any conspiracy or fraud had beea intended. He said that all that appeared to be proved against his client was that he had got possession of these goods and that he had sold them,_ as it waa said, f-or half their value, but the jury would not forget that these same goods had been hawked about and offered to other parties on the same terms, and that they refused to purchase them, and that at this time the market was glutted with such goods. He said he could not attempt to justify such a proceeding, but every one who knew what was passing about them, and who was aware of the shifts that men resorted to when they were in difficulties, knew that these things were constantly done, and he submitted that the proper court to punish parties who were guilty of such acts was the Bankruptcy Court, and a Criminal Court ought not to be made the place for such investigations. Mx. HAWKINS then made a very earnest and able appeal to the jury on behalf of the defendant Myers, who, he said, had for a great many years carried on an extensive business in the city of London, and against whose character there had not been a breath of reproach until the present occasion. He complained of the conduct of the prosecutors in including him with the other defendants in the case of Mr. Lawson, when, he said, it was clear that he had nothing whatever to do with that case, and the charge could only have been made in the hope that it might have the effect of prejudicing the defendant in the eyes of the jury. Ho then proceeded to comment upon the evidence in the case of Mr. Gorman, and contended that Myers had acted with perfect honesty throughout the transaction-that he admitted having offered to purchase the goods, and he would have paid for them if he had obtained possession of them. He asked the jury whether it was likely, -if he had been cognizant of any fraud, that he would have set Mr. Gorman at defiance, and whether he would not, on the contrary, havebeen but too readyto compromise theomatter? Heurged that the adoption of criminal proceedings was evidently an afterthought for the purpose of extorting the money from Myers, and in the hope that he would pay the amountrather than be dragged into a criminal court and placed in his present disgraceful position. He had no desire to say any. thing that was likely to prejudice either of the other defendants, but he was compelled to observe that Taylor had clearly made false statements to the prosecutor and misled him as to the real state of affairs, and that be bad no zight the-jurymightform to the ndA o thes two persns, he urgVd that Mers was not proved to have had any hae with them, and tat his Atatemeut that ahO anevereven seenxthe goods wasstrictly tr ue,ad with.the knowledge of these facts he felt confiTdeAt%tha the jury vrould not convict his client of the serious ofrenoe allegedagainst him. A great many witnes were called to pak to Ayers's. cbaracter, and they Staed that he had always enjoyed the reputation of being a man of strict honour and integrity In all hs business transactious Mr. Baron CEsAsNNg theu proceeded to sm up and placed before the iju the whole of the material facts in the case with great clearness and impartialitv After observing upon the im portance of the inquiry I a mercantile pomt of view, he said it appeared to him that no one could doubt, upon the admitted aind undisputed facts before them, tha two of the defendants had acted in the trawetion in a mnner quite oppoed to any fair and honest priuciples of trading, and it wS painful to see that persons who appeared to have bor,e so good a character previously should have been concorned in such a traneaction. He did not say this in any way with a view to induce the jury to convict the defendante, but, sittiDg in the position he then bad the honour to fill, he felt that it was his duty to express an opinion in referenoe to the transaction as it appewred on tho evidence. His lordship then called the attention of the jury to the evidence an said it was clear from the correspondence and the other facts in the case that Taylor had deceived Mr. Gorman in reference to the manner in which the goods bad been disposed of, and that it was through him that May obtained possession of the property, and was thus enabled to dispose of it to Messrs. 3Meehng so much under its real value. The case of the other defendant, Myers, certainly stood upon a different footing from that of Taylor and May, and the jury would consider how far he was proved to have been concerned in the fraud, Supposing they should be of opinion that fraud actually had been committed. The jury retired at 25 minutes to 4 o'clock to consider their verdict, and in about three-quarters of an hour returned into courb and gave a verdict of Giizlty against Mlay and Taylor, and Not Guity as to Myers. They at the same time strongly recommended Taylor to the mercy of the Court on account of the good character he had received; and the 1ury also begged to be allowed to express their opinion that Messs Meeshing had not exercised proper cation in purchasing the property under Euch cummstances. The defendant Taylor declared that, notwithstanding the verdict of the jury, he was perfectly innocent, and he had been deceived by May, who had Bedalthrough the transection. Mr. Baron CHANiixa, in passing sentence, sid that the jury hadfound the defendants Taylor and May gilty of this fraud, and he entirely concurred in that verdict, and also in the verdict of acquittal a regarded the other defandent, Myers. He must also say, although it was not strictly, perhaps, any part of his duty to do so, that he concurred m the observation of the jury with reference to the conduct of Messrs. Meeking in purchasing these goods so much under their value, and he did so because it was of vital importance in a commercial city like this that all buiness transactions should be conducted with honesty and fairness, and such a proceeding as this was calculated to strike at the root of all honest commercial transactions. It appeared to him that both the defendants had been properly convicted upon the facts before the Court of obtaining goods by fabe pretences, bsut he should give effect to the recommendation of the jury in the case of Taylor, who undoubtedly bore a good character, and who, he believed, had to a certain extent been made the dupe of his companion, and inflict a more lenient punishment upon him than upon May. Under all the circumistances the sentence he shoula pronounce upon Taylor was, that he be imprisoned in the House of Correc tion for six months, and May for 12 months, but without hard labour.I Mr. GvFArD a made an application to his lordship for the costs of the prosecution. Mr. Baron CHA.NNrLT, having conferred with Mr. Straight the deputy-clerk of arraigns, said he doubted wbether he had the power to grant the application, but he would consider the subject. This case concluded the business of the session, and tih Court was adjourned to Monday July 6.
POLICE.

THE WOOLwICH ART1SANS.-TnE WELLNmTO EGOBAsION.-A large batch of emigrants, composed of artieans formerly employed at Woolwich, and thrown out of work by the termination of the war, and their families, sailed on Friday evening from Liverpool for Quebec, in the ship Henry Cooke, which had been chartered for the purpose by Mr. J. M. Walthew, of the former port, as agent in Llverpool forthecommittee conducting the eniigration bythe aid of the fund, to whichthe Duke of Welington contributed 1,0001. The total number of emigrants was Z76, all of whom are provided with railway tickets, which wiU enable them to travel to Toronto, where work will be provided for thmn. A3licAN CouRTEsy.-The Ancient and Hon. Artillery Company of Boston, United States, was the first regularly organized company in America - the germ of the mtary system of the New World. It is the American descendant of an English parent, the Hon. Artilery Company of London, and is remarkable for the fine military spirit by which it is animated. For a century and a half it furniBshed almost the only military school in the United States. The " Ancients and Honourables" is the name by which the corps is popularly known, and its gatherings and anniversaries are always objects of public interest. On the last occasion, on the 1st inst., the 219th anniversary ws held, when, with exceUent taste and feelng, the corps elected his Royal Highness Prince Albett an honorary mem. ber. Consideringthe Republican character of all American institutions, we regard the proceeding as a peculiarly delicats compliment, whioh we are sure will be appreciated by the Prince Consort. It is an evidence of the cordial feeling cherished towards the old country by herl Transatlantic children. When theproposition to elect the Prince had been put and carred thn band played " God save the King" and " Yankee Doodle"'-tunes which at one time represented antagonistic interests, but are now (and long may they continue) mere echoes of the friendship which the two branches of the Anglo-Saxon race cherish towards each other.-United S&vce Gazate. RoYAL CoLLEGE oF SuItaEoNs.-The following gentlemen, having undergone the necessary examinations 'or the diploma, were admitted members of the College, at the meeting of the Court of Examiners on the 19th inst. - Messrs John David Williams, Criccieth, North Wales; James Joseph MCarthy, Royal Navy: William John Mackarsie,Clay-cros,Derbyshire; Dr.Hartley, Blackburn, ILncashire; George Frederick Heriot La Fargue, Husband Bos. worth, Leieestershire; Henry Roger West, Harpenden, St. Alban's- Charles Hatchell, Bengal; Frederirl Lawranoe, Bleadon, Somersetshire; Robert Walter Clifton, Hon. East India Company's Service; Victor Bazire, Mauritius; A"fred George Rolfe,Virginia, United States ; and Thomas Bigland, Brambam, Yorkshire. A WAisNm To SHIPPmS.-The shipping at St. Katharine's Docks bad a narrow escape of being bmunt on Friday morning. A lighter, with a quantity of packages from the East India iocks, shut out from the Nile, was taken into St. atharine's Docks, about 2 o'clock on Friday -nmorning. About 3 o'cock the ioiceman on duty saw smoke Dassing out under the tarpauling andat once gave the alarm, and, on opening the top, fire burst forth from the packages in the or of the lghter, which was meet fortunately subdued but not until some had beenburnt and many others more or les destroyed. The cause of this disaser appea- to have been the breakage of come bottles of nitric acid in one of the packages. It is featfulto contemplate what might havebeen the result had this pac1age been plaoed on board the Nile, as the shippers intended it should have been, for the chances are thai the ame ignition would have talen place,and, if at sea, the ship and crewr wrould nsover have been heard of.

MILITARY AID NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Xhe Zollowiag General Order has been issued - " EIorse Guards, S.W., Juno 19. "-lis Royal Highness the General Commendsng.inChief vils the attention of ofricerscommanding rqztments,Aep6ts, tad depOt battalions, to the condition of their engimental tchools. It is ecarcely less essential to the soldier to be able to read and write and keep his own aouounts than to be acquaInted with his drill. Withoi'c these elementary acquirements no soldier is capable of profiting by t'he instruction giving hinm in the use ot the rVied musket, his promotion is rendered less probable, ana be is deprived of the interest and improvement dezivable from the excellent libraries now placed within his reach. " His Royal Highness is pleased to direct that for the future every soldier, after being cismissad from driji, shall attend school as A dUty until tie is reported upon as sufficiently advanced in reading, writing, ad arithnetio. "1 With the concurrence OT tbe Secretary of State for War no f'ees are to be requiredfer this attendance at scehool. " It wil be -desirable that commanding officers should so arrange the duties of the men as to give, If possible, at least four houra' attendance esh week to a men of the above class. " No man is to be considered eligible for promotion to corporal, unless in the field, who has not been dismissed the above olass. " For promotion -to the rank or sergeant hiigher qualifications may be expected. It is not intended at present to lay down an absolute rule-on -the subject, but t1he attention of commanding officers is particularly called by his Royal ligbness the General Commanding-in-Chief to the import-. i ance of carrying the education of non-commissioned officers to a higher point than the mere acquisition of the arts of reading and writing. With this view it Dlust be weil anderstood that those men who avail themselves most intelligently of the means of improvement within their reach will be generally preferred for promotioni, where, in respect to conduct and soldierlike bearing, they are eligible for it; and that neglect so to do will be regarded as a disqualification. It is not, however, intended hereby to fetter the discretion of commanding officers in the promotion of men who display conspwuous courage, or show the tact and moral influence which give non-commissioned officers weight with their comrades. " By command of his Royal Highness the General Comnanding in Cihef, "G. A. WETHERALL, Adjutant-General." An Admiralty order arrived at the head-quarters of the Chatham division of Royal Marines on Saturday, directing 'the Colonel-Cemmandant E. A.

THE, MURDBR OF MR. PRICE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Several letters having appeared in your columns relating to the murder of Mr. Price, of Melbourne, I enolose, for the information of suoh of your readers aa may desire to know something about the matter, a paragraph from the Sydney Herald, April 9, containing a full account of the manner in which the crime is viewed in the colony. Your obedient servant. W. G. MOOREI i une zv. "The news from Melbourne of the murder of Mr. Priee, the Inspeotor-General of Convicts, by some of the men nuder his charge, has created a great deal of discussion and some excitement. This has arisen, not so much from the crime itself, horrible as it was, as fromevents which havepreeeded, and, as some contend, oconsioned it. There was an outbreak among some of these same prisoners a little while ago, during which the life of one of '.heir guardians was sacrificed. Several men were tried for themurder, butwereacquittedupona legal point ; but during the trial statements were made which tended to show the existence of a oercive system of not severity only, but actual cruelty. This created a sensation among the citizens of Mfelbourne. Meetings were held at which the disclosures were commented upon in strong terms, and a committee was appointed to Inquire into the truth of these matters. The report of this committee was strongly condemnatory of the system of discipline at present in force. Now, by some means or another, the convicts were supplied with copies of this report, and with full knowledge of the sympathies which had been aroused abroad in their favour. It seems that they were not slow to take advantage of this by threatening their keepers with popular vengeance. Whether these men were treated with actual cruelty, or only with a degree of severity necessary to the management of such hardened rffians as most of them were, is still in dispute, but it is a question which must now be cleared up by an investigation which can be relied upon, for without such an investigation the public mind cannot be satisfied. The murder of Mr. Price seems to have been premeditated among a band of long sentenced men,1who,according to the evidence given of them, are more like a berd of wild beasts than a body of human beings. Having got him in the midst of themselves upon the pretext of making various complaints, one of them felled him with a shoveL The whole party then set upon him with hands and feet, with their own manacles, with stones and spades, and everything else within their reach, speedily injuring him to such an extent as to render recovery impossibie. Others who were with him were handled with great roughness although receiving no fatal injuries. This aone, the murderous crew divested themselves of their manacles with a degree of celerity which showed that they mnstpreviou3ly have had some files at work, and prepared to ' rush' their guard and escape. But these men stood so firm that the attempt was not made. The people of Williams. town, too, soon turned out in arms to assist, if necessary. Finally, a body of military arrived on the spot, and, although with great difficulty, the men were secured and removed to the hulk. Mr. Price soon died in great agony. An inquest had been commenced when the last mail left, but had not concluded. There has been quite a controversy among the Melbourne papers upon this horrible affair. One of them (the Argus) boldly declares that the whole guilt of the murder attaches to those whose morbid sympathies for the conviets and against their gaolers have encouraged the former to give vent to their demoniae passions. Others defend the course taken by the citizens' committee, and look upon this outhreak as the not unnatural result of a system of brutalizing tyranny, which has made the convicts more desperate than ever, instead of reforming them. It is impossible to form any decisive opinion here upon these questions until we shaUl be in possession of further information."
drIDDLE CLASS EDUCATION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-While the general scheme for connecting the universities with the education of the middle classes is daily finding more favour, the objections to the title "Associate in Arts" are becoming more and more apparent. The Syn. dicate appointed at Cambridge to report on this subject are well known to be strongly of opinion that the term Literate is far preferable to that proposed by the Oxford statute, and which vwas confessedly adopted with much hesitation. The title Literate would be an honourable and suitable one; though not altogether a new word, it is as yet unappropriated, and might well be applied to the class in queston, and the abbreviation " Lit. Oxon." or " Lit. Cant." would be convenient, as marking the connexion with the particular university without having any deceptive resemblance to the affix belonging to a degree. Moreover-und this is most important-the title would carry its own meaning with it ; the public would not be tempted to take it in a sense which the uiversities would be very leaions of Attaching to it. The university might well certify that a person was a Literate when it had found by examination that he had certain attainments, but it could scarcely call him an associate when he would have no privilege of membership, or connect him with the faculty of arts when he was acknowledged to be ignorant of some of the principal subjects reauisite for aa ee ein that facnlty. ade s would be the difference between the B.A and the proposed A.A., in point of the examinations passed, the necessity in the former case of residence, with its many formative and healthy influences, produces a wider difference still; and the similarity of the two titles would induce many a young A A., to his great injury, to overlook this difference, and would lead him, and perhaps the public in general, into the error of thinking that the power of pro. duoing knowledge in an exawination is the one all-sufficing test of education in the eyes of the universities. It is very desirable that the samue title shotuld be adopted by the two univercities, and I truet that in both the sup. ,orters of the project are too mulch in earnest to peril their harmonious action by inflexibility in minor points. The statute at Oxford is, r believe, not yet fioaUy passed, and opinions with respect to tbis title are much divided. It is to be hoped, then, that this point may he left open for tbe present, and that the universities may be able jointly to adopt a title which nimy be creditable and attraective, without abating in the very least their traditional avoidazwe of anything that is at all hollow or unreal.

SZBGEANTS AND GOOD CONDUCT PAY. TO TEE: EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Considerable discussion has of late taken plaee on the subject of good-condact pay for sergeants in tte army, which proves the interest taken in this class and the desire on tho part of the publio to reward their seevices. The subjeoct, however, has not hitherto been properly {nves. tigated, nor has it been viewed as the i2crits of the case deserve. While it is desirable and politic, inerder to hold forth in. ducements to young men of education and character to enter the army, to increase the pay of tire several grades of sergeants, and thus raise their value respectively, it is of importance that the scheme for doing so should be wveU considered, so as not to be unjust in its operation, as well as to guard against paying for a lower standard of merit and efficiency than is necessary. Let the subiect, therefore, be fairly investigated on the principle that the labourer is worthy of his reward. In the first place, then, le. this question be consideredIs it compatible with the position of the sergeant's rank that he should receive good conduct pay, as has been advocated ? Now, it must be borne in mind tiat a soldier is raised to the rank of sergeant for intelligence and good conduet, for which position he is prepared, and his abilities tested, by a probation in the respective ranks of " lance corporal" and " corporal." Immediately he is raised from the II rank and file" he receives an increase of pay, and his position is so marked by cbevrons and a distinctive unifora that all who look upon him decide at once that he is a well-conducted soldier. The position of sergeant is essentially a reward for conduct and merit combined. The " rank and file" receive pay at the respective rates of Is. and Is. 4d. per diem, which may be increased by good conduct and length of service to Is. 6d. and is. 10d.-a 'ise and just provision if the reward is bestowed deservingly, as there are many very deserving men in the ranks who are ineligible for promotion because they can neither read nor write. To obtain, however, this muximum rate of pay the soldier in receipt thereof must have served at least 28 years after the age of 18, and have had no entry in the regimental defaulters' book for 16 years previously. Such a circumstance is of very rare occurrence in the infantry of the Line. It has been urged, as an argument in favour of the soldier retaining the good-conduct pay he is in possession of when promoted to the rank of sergeant, that a corporal may be in receipt of pay, viz., Is. 10d. (the mazimum he can possibly receive, and under the conditions detailed in the preceding paragraph, equal to that received by the sergeant. This is true, but it must be remembered that the extra pay, so well merited, is for length of service as weU as good conduct; and that the instances are very rare. To give to a sergeant good conduct pay implies in the abstract that there are soldiers of bad character appointed to this position. Such an idea would be most injurious to therank, us well asunjust; consequently, it becomes necessary to avoid every measure having even the semblance of any such insinuation. The hardship, as also the injustice of the conditions prescribed by the War-office circular of the 16th of January, 1857, authorizing the issue of good-couduct pay to such sergeants only as were in possession of the boon on their promotionto said rank, is now admitted by all who have given the subject the slightest consideration. To give good-conduct pay to all sergeants according to length of service in the army under the coatditions of the good-conduct warrant-viz., Id. a-day for every five years' service-would be equally unjust and unwise, as it would in the long run prove a barrier to exertion. The following example wiU corroborate this statement:- A. B. enlists in 1842, bnt is not promoted sergeant until 1857; whereas Y. Z., who enlists in 1851, for his good conduct, general intelligence, and attention to his duties, is promoted sergeant in 1854. A. B., on becoming a sergeant in 1857, having 15 years' service, receives 2s. Id. a-day (viz., ls. 10d., the sergeant's pay, and 3d. as good-conduct pay). Y. Z., however, who in 1857 has served as a seTgeant for three year. but having only six years' service, merely re. ceives Is. 1ld. a-day (viz., Is. 10d., and one penny good-conduct pay). Now, it must not be lost sight of that . B. and Y. Z. were rewarded for good conduct by being promoted to the rank of sergeant; yet by the operation of such a scheme to increase the sergeant's pay it wil be seen that Y.Z., who has served as sergeantfor three years, receives 2d. a-day less pay than A.B, just promoted to that rank , what inducements are here held out to Y.Z. for exertion, or to young intelligent men to enter the army, seeing that increase of pay in the sergeants' rank would depend, not on length of service as sergeant, but on length of service in the army ? Such a system of reward would be contrary to the ordinary conceived principles of justice, and would not possess a paraUel in any community. The question now arises what scheme would be the best calculated to stimulate individual exertion, develope efficiency, and enhance the several grades of sergeant so as to induce the young men of the middle class of the community to enter the army. A better scheme could not be imitated than that adopted for the reward of services in the civil departments of the Government and in aU private firms whose existence depends upon orderand the efficiency of their servants. Clerks in the several departments of the State, as wel as otber public officers, are arranged into classes, and receive salaries accordingly. Each class receives an increase to the original stipend after certain prescribed periods of service therein, the sliding scale being so arranged that the maximum pay of any class does not exceed the minimun salary of the class next above it. Promotion, however, to the higher class is a reward for superior ability, and not for length of service. Here, then, is a system which, while it rewards ability, gives a stimulus for exertion, and which, if made applicable to the rank under consideration, as hereafter detailed, will enhance its value and give satisfaction to all concened. Sergeants on promotion to receive Is. 10d. per diem, to be raised to 2s. 4d. by an increase of 2d. at a time for every three years' service in the rank, provided he is reported to have discharged his duties satisfactorily during said period, and has had no entry made against him in the defaulters' book for one year previously to his becoming entitled to such extra pay. This allowance to be subject to forfeiture at the rate of 2d. at a time, for 12 months, for neglect of duty or other irregulartiies, wvhich should be recorded in the regimental defaulter's book. Thus. a power would be placed in the hands of commanding-officers to punish sergeants for minor offences, 'without degrading their rank in the eyes of subordinates, and prevent a reference to the extreme measure of courts-martial, very often resorted toin such cases. Colour-sergeants, on promotion, to receive 2s. 4d. per diem, to be raised to 2s. 10d. by an increase of 2d. at a time for every two years' service in the rank. In the event of a colour-sergeant being deprived of his badge as such, and reverting to the rank of sergeant, be should only receive the rateof pay he was in possession of before his promotion to be colour-sergeant. Quartermaster-sergeants on promotion to receive 3s. per diem, to be raised to Sa, 6d. by an increase of 2d. at a tune for every two years' service as such. Sergeant-majors on promotion to receive 3s. 6d. per diemz, to be raised to 4s. 3d. by an increase of 3d. at a time for every two years' service in that rank. The extra pay should also carry with it some distinguishing mark-viz., a strip of lace round both culls of lacket for every 2d. or 3d. received in addition to the pay of the rank. Here let it be recapitulated, to show that the increase proposed is only 6d., to sergeants after nine years',to coloursergeants and quartermaster-sergeants after six years', and only 9d. to sergeant-muajors (a position of great trusty after six years' service, in the several ranks respece tively. Now, the good-conduct warrant provided for an increase of the pay to the rank and file of 6d.; let, then, a similar increase be insured to the grades above-mentioned for service therein. As every opportunity is now afforded to the soldier in the regimental schools as at present constituted for improvement and acqufring knowledge, it becomes desirable that they should be subjected to an examination before being promoted, to ascertain if they possess the requirements necessary for the efflcient discharge of the duties of the position to which they are to be raised. The standard of qualification must not be too high. Sergeants should be able to writelegibly, and from dictation, understand the first four roles of arithmetio (simple and compound), and be capable of drifling a recruit sO as to prepare him for company drill. Colour-sergeants to understand proportion, simple interest, first four rules of vulgar and decimal fractions, and be capable of drilling a company thoroughly. Quartermaster-sergeants, as prescribed for colour-sergeants, and, in addition, to understand the rudiments of book-keeping. Sergeant-majors-tbe qualifications detailed for coloursergeants, and in addition to be capable of drilling the non-commissioned officers in the sword and other exercises, to make them efficient in the field, and of manceuvring a battalion. While on the subject of rewards to sergeants it will not be our of place to remark that the good of the servicoe would be oonsulted, and many a young inteUigent soldier saved from recklessness, who, by being tried by courtmartial when corporal for an offence arising out of the follies of youth and inexperience of the service, becomes indifferent for nmany years of his future service, were commanding officers empowered to reduce corporals to the rank of private by an entry in the regimental defaulters' book. Such a measure would be found equaUy effective in checking irregularities as that now rtsorted to. Corporals should also be subject to loss of good-conduot pay for irregularities under the same conditions as privates, as they are included among the " rank and file;" they should not, however, be punished in any way whereby their authority would be weakened and their position degraded in the eyes of their subordinates. As the subject of pension is involved in the question of rewards for service in the army, and as an increase has bee hinted at, it is well to observe that the present pension warrant is just in its conditions and liberal in its allowances; for while it grants to all soldiers, after 21 years service, without reference toe rank, 8d. a-day, the good soldier is rewarded, not only while serving, by au increase to his pay, but reaps, the advantages of his conduct and merit by an increase to his pension for life. Arg,uments could be used to prove satisfactorily thai the pension allowvances are liberal, and a just remsunerationufor services rendered to the_State, &A UffY1U±LtL WaO HAS SERVED. Kent, June 19,
THE GOVERNMfRNT OF CEYLO'. (From the EBamirzer.) There are more ways than one of doing injustict a Government; its faults may be exaggerated; its mnts may be underrated; errors may be imputed to it of which it has not been guilty; the good that it has accomplished may he ascribed to other ctuses, or it may be denied, or the critic rmay choose to shut his eyes to it altogether. But all these ways of wrongmg a Government are hackneyed. It was left for Sir H. G. Ward, the present Governor of Ceylon, to hit upon an original one, of which he has given the public a specimen in his mode of treating the administration of Lord Torrington. The msethod of Sir HL G. Ward consists, not in ignoring fair results, but in ignoring their obvious causes. No man seesthe excellent effects of a predecessor's polcy with a clearer vision ; he not only sees, hut beholds them with admiration; he not only admires, hut admires enthnsiastically ; he finds the colony on his arrival in the enJoyment of "a prosperity unexampled in its previous bistory ;" and he writes despatches home excpressing in rapturous terms his satisfaction at finding himself in the midst of it, But it is the result only that he sees with the optics of an eagle; Sir Henry is blind as a bat to the sources of the prosperity that amazes him; he professes himself "unable to account for it ;" the simplest and mo4t natural exrplnation never once occurs to him; he never dreams of attributing to Lord Torrington the state of thiDgs that Lord Torrington left behind him, and, instead of congratulating hinson his fortune and success, observes that " It was his fate to enter on the government at a time when progress wvas impossible and improvement out of the que stion," lord Torrington was well justified in expecting from Sir Henry Ward avery different notice of an administration which had oorne the heat of the day and brunt of the battle, and made the path of government smooth and easy for his successots. His lordship observes, in his temperate and dignified letter to Mxt. Labouchere, lately printed in a Parliamentary paper:-. " Harassed as [ have been for so many Years bY reflections cast on my pubic and legislattve acts during the time that I administered the government of Ceylon. reflections which I wasa utterly unable to tusn aide till their injustice couild be demonstrated by results which had still to be waited for; I entertained a natural confidence that the present Governor, with opportunities of pereonal obtervatiou and experlence, would have been enabled to trace my policy in its effects, and to render, by his testimony to its soundness and success, that tardy justice which has so long been withheld from me, sad, allow me to add, fiom Earl Grey, under whose ample and able instructions I entered upon my government, and was guided In my poUcy. `"3y disappointment, therefore, is keen on dlscoveridgtha, raithough 6ir H. G. Ward has the sattfactionto find himself inthe midst of -a prosperity almost unexampled In the prrvious hibtory of Ceylon, the extent of his acknowledgmentas i a confession of his inability to 'coontat for i*,-an avowal whicb be aceonopaules by iguting thote acts of my government to which it is mainly referable, and condoning my assumed shortcomings by ascribing to me utter nelplesmuess. that it was my fate, as he Bays, 'to enter on tte government at a time when progr was impoedible,' and 'improvement out of the question.' " Lord Torrington further remarks:- "It does seem to me strange when Bir H. G. Ward was made .o well acquainted with the critcal condition of Oeylon before my arrival, and is so familiar with its state after my departure, that the measmure 'hich I originated at the time for the reietf Of the colony, anu which haesproved sO successfal since, were not brought under his notioe. I do cotoocde in his view that a time of great diffiecuty must neoessaily be a period of inaction. Oa the contrary, stimulated by the nsi,s in which I found the colony involved, I addreesed myself to the temk of its extrication and ita future security against similar embarrasnmests, by a oernes of precautions asd reforms which had they 0Jeenbroughtunder Mis notice would have satisfied Sr H. G. Ward that to their operatfox the hland in maizly indebted for that easy condition of its finances whicb so materIal facilitates his own course of action at the present day." Sir H. G. Ward pronounces impossible what had actually come to pass, and declares an improvement out of the question which was staring him? bodily in the face. The trees were so numerous and so flourishing that they concealed the grove completely from the spectator's view. When Lord Carlisle went over as Lord-Lientenant to Ireland he found that country, as Sir Henry WVard found Ceylon, "in a state of unexampled prosperity." Novw, imagine his Lordship vwiting to the Home-office expatiating on the tranquil and flourishing condition of the country, and at the same time observing of the previous Adminis. trations for the last 20 years that they " entered on the government in times when progrees was impossible, aud improvement out of the question." But this would not have matched the absurdity of Sir IL Ward, for the direct ifuence of wise government was far more strongly marked in the case of Ceylon than of Ireland, where so much more was due to the course of events over which the lws and Government bad but little controL Lord Torrington's administration, in fact, did nothing for Ceylon, with the trivial exception of leaving an island which he found in the greatest confusion in a state of ad. mirable order, and a colohy which he found on the verge of bankruptcy blessed with a full and a flowing exchequer. Ceylon is at this moment one of the most flourishing settlements in the vast circle of our colonial empire. But Sir H. Ward seems to have thought that even the p.?se of havsng done nothing wvas to much to allow the orrngten Government, for, though he admits it was done " with firmness," he is careful to add that his lordship was "most ably aided and seconded by Mr. MI'Carthy." "It is necessary," continues the letter to Mr. Labouchere, * To remind yoe, Sir, of the state in which I found Ceylon on mY assumption of the government in 1847: its treasury nearly empty' its current expditure largely in excess of its aunnual income, its oommerce declining, the cltivation of Its staple products, coffee and cinnamon, suddenly arrested and discouraged, an uit generalcondition leading rapidly to banoruptcy. It was noner these disheartening circumstances that, according to the Dresent deepatch. I practically did nothing, but did it ' with firmneas,' and was I most ably aided and secouded by Mr. 3POuthy.' " The slightest and most superficial inquiry would have saved Sir Henry Ward from committing himself to such a tissue of absurdity, contradiction, and injustice. From this able Mr. M'Carthy, had he been called upon for the details of the assistance he rendered his chief, Sir Henry Ward would probably have learned the truth which it appears he hsd not the sagacity to read in the phenomena of order and prosperity surrounding him. The most cursory analysis of the nothing done by Lord Torrington woluid have disclosed the important series of somethings which his lordship has had no alternative but to record for himself-a duty which he discharges with equal clearness and modesty in the paper before us. "But Mr. M'Carthy, Lord Torrington's immediate successor, was not silent on the subject. From his opening address to the Legislative Council his lordship quotes the following passa%e, which it is strange that Sir H. G. Ward should never have read, and stranger still, if he did read it, that he should have remained insensible to Lord Torrington's indefatigable and efficient exertions:- . " I cannot conulude the observatluos which I have thought It incaunbent on me to mate without ooDgratulating yeu, gentlemen, on the remarkable and. of late years, quite unprecedented state of financial prosrerity and promise of which the papers that I now lay on the table afford much satisfactory proof. The comparative statement of the revenne and ePenditre fo r the half of the preent Year shows a surplus revenue of £10,i63 ISS 31d.; and, to judge from the large Bims received into tee Treoasry s ince that date, accompanied by the unoeasing cse which bhas been taken to diminish the expenditure whenever an opportaniitv ha been offerei by the fusion into one of dffferent departmenth of the publo service, amd a rigid control over the outlay of the public mon ey, it may, I think, be justly and reasonably anticipated that the surplus will be increased by the end of the flnkncisi year. You wil also perceive, from the papers now laid on0 our table, that this surplus is no forced or fictitious one produced by the poAipirement of charges which would sooner or later hav to be paid. I have to point out to you the pleaclng fact that within the last few months the whole of the outstnding debts to the 1r sidencles and agents LnIndia have been paid off by the Governmentthe debt of £i0.w0 to the Orieotal Bank, contracted in the embarraemeut oft 8,Mhas beeot,paid of, DrinciDal and interest, with the exoeotion ot about ;ltt.0u^, a sum of £10,0Q0 baving bees paid within the last few days. Laree remittances have been made to the Agent, general in rondun, who, contrary to the precedent of late years in which he baa frequently been In advance for payments on account of the COylon Government, will have a considerable balance in hand on he let of January next; and with aU these payment and this almost total extinction of the debts due by this Government the accounts of assts and liabkilties which I have had made up to the lIt of October last ehow a b3lanoe In favour of the colony at the latter date of no less than £4625895,. 3id. as compared with a balanoe of £365S,2 Ie.- 77d.. on thae lSt of Januarylast, being an increase of £26,056 Ua,. Sid." For other details of Lord Torrington's measures we must refer our readers to the letter itself; he did exactly what the most judicious Government at home would have done in the same circumstances, and for which he well deserved the encomiums of Earl Grey, introducing the strictest economy into the public expenditure, while at the saine time he improved the revenue and developed the public resources, by abolishing export duties, with the exception of a single article, revising the tariff and amending the Castoms law-in a word, by a prudent appic^ation of the princinles of free trade to the commerce of the island. The results are visible in the statistical returns. The value of coffee exported rose from 328,7911. in 1846 to 534,4541. in 1849. The value of cinnamon from 40,1651. in 1848 to was 73,3861. in 1849. The vae of imports, excluve of secie, 998,849L. in 1846, when it was in a rapid decline. In 1849 it began to look up; ini1850 it rose to 1,030.2961.; in 1854 it reached nearly 1,250,0001., and in 1855 was very little less than 1,500,0001. Sir H. G. Ward might well call athig an uexamled roserit," bt itisEnost astoniahing that, even as a matter of curiosity, he should never havo investigated whence this prosperity arose. The inquiry -would have abated his unphilosophical wonder, and imparted to him in its stead some of the felicity which the epicureau poetasribes to the man who has learned the causes of things. There was, in fact, only one point in which Lord Tor rington exposed himself to grave censure in his public con duct as Governor of Ceylon; we allude to his unfair treat ment of Sir J. Emerson Tennent; but his lordship has completely obliterated the recoUection of that fault by the candour and generosity with which he has publicly acknowledged it. We have already approved the tone and spirit of the entire of the letter before us; but the following pa e is that which will advance the writer most in the pubgis esteem:- " If in the couse of these strictures I may appear egotisticA, or to arrogate an undue share of merit for the pollcy of my government, I beg it ditinctly to be understood that I act under the Impulse of feelIngs that extend tooteirsamweb as to myseltf.
