TEH CIIRISTIANIZATION OF IN7DIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In common, no doubt, with many others, I read with great interest the notices in your journal of Thursday of the sermons preached by the principal clergy and other religious ministers of the metropolis on the Day of Humiliation. It is gratifying to observe the entire absence of those perverted views of Christian principles which found favour in some influential quarters just before the late war. Crime will now meet with the punishment it deserves, withouit any reclamation in the namue of religion. It is also no less satisfactory to see evidence of a general feeling that much greater efforts than heretofore should be made for the Christianization of India; and it may be hoped that this feeling will prove no transient one, but that the agencies which have been employed in the cause with unalloyed advantage will for the future receive such increased an p port in this country as to multiply their results. It has been very appositely remarked that no evidence hn appeared of any shadow vof offence haviug been given to the native population by the operations of missionaries. On another point there seems more diversity of opuiruon, perhap arising from the very small amount of information posessed bythe English,public on the details of Indian administration. The clergy insist very generally on the duty of the Government to exhibit its Christian character; but on the mode in which this should be done and the extentto which it should be carried there aeems less agreement. Few will not approve the exhortation " not to sanction idolatry by a timid disrespect for one's own holy religion;" and it Is to be hoped as few will accept the view " that it was the duty of a Christian Government to have suppressed the vile religion of the Hindoos by the strong hand." But between these two positions the field of policy is almost boundless; and little result is likely to follow unless some practical middle course be pointed out. Accordingly, some of the preachers have embodied their opinions on the subject in definite propositions which are likely to attract attention not only from the high character of those who have put them forward, but because they probably represent the views of a considerable section of the religious public. It seems, therefore, only a duty to point out how in some instances they appear alien from those prcipls which, if any lesson is to be learned from history, are never violated with impunity in the relations between rulers and their aubjecta. In dealing with our fellow-subjeets of a different religion we must not ignore the fact that sincerity of belief is altogether a different thing from the soundness of its foundation. A man's creed may be utterly absurd, its ritual detestable, and the resulting habits of life altogether immoral; but yet his belief may be stronger than that of the most intelligent Christian, and his conviction that in forsaking his religion he is committing a fearful sin may be as crushing to his spirit as wilful apoBtacy would be to ours. This is, in fact, hardly putting the case strongly enough. The lower the civilization of a people, and the more debased their superstition, the more awful does any, the least, deviation from traditional customs appear. Any temporal misfortune--a flood, a pestilence, an unsuccessful war-ix at once regarded as a manifestation of the wrath of the offended Deity for the special offence, and the panic fear of the worshipper knows no bounds. If the religlon of a civilized man be insulted by a foreigner the offence produces indignation ; if the superstitions of a savage are violated, the immediate issue is absolute frenzy from this circumstance. When Agathoeles'olockaded Carthage, the inhabitants, we are told, attributed the misfortune to the havng purchased infant children to burn alive to Moloch, instead of giving their own, and no less than 800 persons who had been guilty of thia lesemajesty came forward conscience-stricken and gave themselves up. Heathenism, in fact, is always ready enough to cry out, " Shall I give my first born for my transgression-the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?" and it is only the spirit of a better faith that can answer, "He hath showed thee, 0 nan, what is good; and what doth the Lord requlre of thee. but to do justice and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God?" Any proceeding, therefore, which implies that a heathen is not religious, because his religion is a depraved one, that he needs not to be convinced (like any other of the great human family) because the task of convincing him is a tedious and difficult one, must be injudicious on the part of those who wish to convert him. Such a proceeding is the treating with open contempt that which he has always been accustomed to reverence. But some, while conceding that the ignorant heathen is no less sincerely attached to his religion than the Christian, will still maintain that there are especial re2sons which bar his claim to toleration. It is, in fact, this broad question which is at issue when it is demanded that "themoral law for England should be the moral law for India." No one, of course, denies that the foundations of morality are identical for all places and all times; but if the above proposition is to be taken as more than the statement of an axiom, it must mean that as a Christian people we are bound to have the same standard of morality embodied in our Indian and in our English code. I eannot persuade myself that the excellent persons who have professed their adhesion to this principle can possibly have perceived its bearing. No two nations ever existed having precisely the same standard of morality embodied in their laws, and. in no one nation is the moral standard the same at different periods of development. The law is always perhaps below the moral standard of the best citizens, and above that of the worst. It is the business of the skilful statesmana to see that it coincides with that of the great mass, or its enforcement becomes impossible. Could the law against duelling have been enforced half-a-century ago ? What would have been the operation of our mild criminal code with our rough Anglo-Saxon ancestors? l How could servage have been abolished under the Plantagenets ? HAow can it in Russia at this day ? Are we not told of things permitted in one age to the chosen people, "1 because of the hardness of their hearts ?" Some persons-probably a great majority in the British islands-consider the celibacy of the Romish clergy a demoralizing institution; is any statesman insane enough to attempt by legislation to hinder its enforcement by the authorities of the Romish church ? The practical rule of doing as we would be done by (not as others would do by us, which is a vary different thing) will, I suspect, be a much safer guide in the government of India than any theories about the special duties of Christian rulers. We are bound to render to Cssar the things which are Cosar's, to establish and maintain a secure and just Government, which shaU be a guarantee of life, property, and rational freedom to every member of the community; but let us beware of the ttemptation to set Ciesar about doing God's work. Political economists tell us that the material interests of a country can only be furthered by a Government confining its operation to opening communications, allowing traffic its natural course. Very much the same is the case with its moral and spiritual welfare. Let the Government open roads for this kind of commerce; giving every facility for the interchange of ideas. Let the ways of science, literature, and religion be kept clear and free from all impediments, except such as are anecessary condition of maintaining civil order; but let us be very careful how we attempt to advance the " kingdom which is not of this world" by an appeal, direct or indirect, to anything else than reason and conscience. With such a policy the conversion of the Hlindoo may proceed slowly, but it will, at any rate, be sure, and Its progress wil not weaken the bond of confidence between the governors and the governed, | which must be maintained if it is to proceed at all.

" WIAT S A VTS1TATION ?"-Mr. Spearman, of Newton-hall, at the recent dinner of the Dnrham CoTnty Agioultural Society, was reminded, by the absenco of clergymen, of a story which perhaps he might be per. mitted to relate, as he had it from a very good source-VIZ, from a very excellent divine, who was himself a prebendary of the cathedral church of Durham. Two honest farmers, in riding along together, encountered a large number of clergymen; and one of them said to the other, "1 Where be all these parsons coming from ?" To this his friend replHed, "1 They've been at a visitation." The other, no wiser than before, says, "What's a visitationP' and the answer he received, was, "Why, it's where all the parsons goes once a-year and swaps teir sermons." Hlis friend, on being t,hus enlJghterned, quietly remarked, "DaDg it, but oar chap mnun Bet the worst on It every time."-Ga~h~ead Observer.

AfONRY-AfARKT a7dOITYTIhITBLL1GBNOB. Monday Evening. The Bank of England have to-day raised their rate of discount from 6 per cent., which was adopted on Thursday last, to 7 per cent. This masure was fully anticipated, and, from the extent of the applications to-day, it is doubtf'ul if a further movement will not immediately be found necessary. The amount of bullion withdrawn has been only 9,0001., but it Is aseerted that 400,0001. will be despatched to New York and Boston by the Baltic and Canada on Wednesday and Satnrday next, and, as the Indian exchanges show an adverse alteration of lj per cent. at Bombay and 2 per cent. at Calcutta, it is also anticipated that the shipments in that direction by the overland mail of the 20th wvll oe larger than was at one time thought probable. With these prospects a fresh advance can scarcely be avoided, and perhaps we may again see the rate at 8 per cent., the highees point it has ever reached during modern experienoe, and at which it stood in October, 1847. In proportion, however, to the suddenness of the pressure will be the rapidity of the ultimate reaction, and, as on that occasion the rate within a year afterwards went back to 3 per cent.-there 'will in the present case be reason to look for an extraordinary turn of the tide as soon as the immediate difficulty shall have been completely met. Notwith. standing the tempting rates of exchange at New York andPalcutta, the tranmision of specie thither under existing circumstances must be a hazardous speculation, since the question in each instance is not what may be the apparent profit, judging from the present advices, but what will have been the course of the markets in the interval before the operatioa can be carried out. In America the arrears now due to England and the continent are enormous, and are accumulating every week, and the moment the panic subsides and the influence of the fortnightly gold arrivals from California again begins to be felt the scarcity of bills upon us may be as remarkable as their present abundance. In India, likewise, the falling off in the shipments of produce and the demand upon the Government for payments to English ateam companies for the transport of troops must exercise a strong effect in restoring more favourable conditions. There Is consequently nothing to excite apprehension that the distulrbance wil be protracted. The sole cause for anxiety is lest the fall of such houses in the provinces and elsewhere as are unavoidably compromised by the American failures, and the fluctuations in the markets for Eastern produce, should beget any vague terror calculated to lead even to a single day of general distrust. The belief is, however, that the decided action of the Bank has removed ail danger on that account. So well iLs the effect of a rapid advance in the rate of discount now understood that when the necessity for it exists a vigorous course of action is at once appreciated. It is unquestionable that this was the effect observable to-day. When the advance to 7 per cent. was announced every one saw that tha work of protection was in progress, and the conviction tiat in case of need there would be no hesitation in making another movement established a sense of perfect security. The funds went down, and there was much uneasiness respecting the probable fate of the manufacturing firms that have sustained losses, but there was no fright lest a period might be approaching at which it would be impossible even for perfectly solvent houses to obtain money on any terms. The absence of excitement to-day among the banking and commercial community afforded a striking contnast to the scence that used to be witnessed when the true principles which regulate the currency were unrecognized. If any regret was exDressed it was simply that the rise to 7 per cent. had not been resolved upon a day or two earlier. Altogether the feeling exhibited was such as to excite pride in our healthful system of finance, and to confirm the impresson that, although this shock from America has come upon us in the midst of th - Indian mutiny, we shal be able to withstand it, so that its consequences, heavy as they must necesEarily be, shall not destroy confidence or interrupt the general welfare of the country. The fluctuations In the funds to-day have been extremely great, and although there was a partial rally from the lowest point, the final quotations, as compared with those of Saturday, show a decline of more than 10 per cent. Just before the commencement of businems it appeared as if the market would open buoyantly from the effects of the Indian news, but rumours were at once circulated that a further movement on the part of the Bank was imminent, and the first regular quotation was 88s to J for money, being a decline of J per cent. The formal notification of the advance in the rate was made forthwith, and a gradual fall then took place to 88k. Subsequently a succession of heavy males caused further weakness, and transactions at length took place at 871, the lowest point reached during the present year. Towards the close, however, there was less unsteadiness, and the last transactions were at 87a to § for money, ancd 881 for the 10th of November. Some of the sales during the afternoon were said to have been effected to close the account of a large speculator for a rise, but the publication of the rate of exchange from Calcutta and the axpectation of shipments of gold being about to be made to New York also induced many operations. There was likewise an apprehension that mercantile stoppages would be announced from the provinces, and that the various banks throughout the country would be likely to sel stock to provide for the wants of their customers. An erroneous report was at the same timespreadof saleshaving been madeon account of the Bank of England. The rate for loans on Government securities from the present account to the 10th of November was 6i per cent. Bank Stock closed at 2111 to 212k ex. dividend; Reduced, 861 to 87; New Three per Cents., 86i to 87; and India Stock, 208 to 210. There were very few transactions either in India Bonds or Exchequerbills. Some small sales of the former took place at 30s. discount; and of the latter at l5s. discount. The foreign stock-market has been active at generally reduced rates. Turkish Six per Cents. declined heavily, but a partial recovery took place towards the close; the last price, however, shows a I fall of about 4 per cent, since Saturday. Spanish and Dutch continue exceptionally firm.- Brazilian Five per Cents., 1829 and 1839, were negotiated at 99i and 99; Buenos Ayres, for the account, 79i; Danish Five per Cents., 101 and 101* ; Mexican, for the account, 19i and a; Peruvian Four-and-aHalf per Cents., for the account, 77 and 76; Portuguese, for the account, 44 and 43; Sardinian, 90j and 89 ; Spanish, 40k, J, and i; ditto, New Deferred, for the account, 25i and i; Turkish Six per Cents., 881 and 86; for the account, 89k, 88k, J, 88, 1, 87k, 85 ,and 86.; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 98and 97k; for the account, 97k and '-Dutch Two-and-a lf per Cents., 64 and c5; and the Four per Cent, Certificates, l he corn-market was heavy this morning at a reduction of 2s. per quarter. The final quotations this evening from the Paris Bourse were 66f. 80c. for money, and G6f. 90c. for the end of the month, showing a fall of a little more than three-eighths per cent. At Vienna there has been a declne of three-quarters per cent. The diecount houses have increased their rate of allowance to 6 per cent. for money at call, and 6i per cent. for deposits with short notice, being an advance of three-quarters per cent. The National Discount Company have notified that their terms are respectively 6k and 6k per cent, The rate of the jointstock banks for deposit will be 6 per cent. The political accounts from India to-day were received ith univeru,l satisfaction, every one being died to consider that all uncertainty with reta Uoth t ffixeM caof our troopsinthere-etb - ment of authority is at an end. From Bombay the commercial accounts also are not unsatisfactory, since they show a demand for imported goods at advancing prices; but the intelligence from Calcutta of the Bank of Bengal having refused to make advances on Government paper or commercial biUs, except of short date, has occasioned fears that the step may have led to a serious presure on the other banks, as 'well as on the mercantile houses. It was known on the arrival of the previous mail that the Bank of Bengal had already refused such advances, but it was added that the Government had overruled their objections. It fow appears that the latter have given way. The satisfactory course for the Bank, instead of refusing absolutely sny class of paper, would have been for them to have raised their rate to whatever point the demand wouid justify. The true way to produce a panio is to render any large clas of securities altogether unnegotiable. A rate almost prohibitory may be fixed without the public taking alarm, because they have then the feeling of security that in the case of the worst emergeney they are not shut out from all possibility of aid. Four or five failures-some of them of importance -were announced from Glasgow to-day. The principal was that of J. Monteith and Co., whose liabilities are believedtobe extensive. Theywere large shippers of Glasgow goods to America and elsewhere. The other houws mentioned are Patteson and Co., Macdonald and Co., and Wallace and Co. Prompt measures were felt to be necessary to prevent as far as possible any increase of disster, and a committee of the Western Bank of Scotland had been stmmoned to investigate the position of these and other lirms. The private letters from New York to-day all express considerable confidence that the height of the panic had passed. A large proportion of the houses that had been brought down are described as having had no sound basis, but some of the names included are those of establishments that stood extremely welL Among these were Garner and Co., a commision house, which is said to have enjoyed credits to a large amount from leading firms on this side, and Abbot Dodge and Co., In the flour trade. All the banks at Providenoe, Rhode Inland, had stopped by a concerted arrangement, and the same result is described as had been experienced at Baltimore, the panic being at once mitigated. From Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore the advlces show an Improvement. The discount on the note circulation of the suspended banks at the two latter citles was not more than 4 or 5 per cent., bills on New York being purchaseable on those terms. The Bank of Pennsylvania have advised their London correspondents that remittances will be miade with undisturbed regularity. Purchases of American stoc3ks by English capitalists continue on a large seale, and this circumstance constitutes at the present moment a material addition to the adverse course of our relations wih l that country. The advioe fromParis state that at a meeting of the Bank of France on Saturday the necessity for an advance in the rate of discount was discussed, and that it is now considered certain. The Directors, however, were anxious that a alight delay should take place after the ill-advised increase of facilities adopted only a week ago. During the past month about a dozen failulres are stated to have occurred In Paris, but all of secondrate houes. From all parts of the continent there are accounts of Increasing pressure, and at Frankfort, Berlin, Vienna, and Turin the banks will dis count only short paper and that in certain limited amounts for the several applicants. The reports of the trade of the manufacturing towfns during the past week show considerable dulness, in consequence of the increase in the rate of discount and the losses fromAmericanfailures. At Manchester business has also been again affected by the stoppage of several silk houses. Birmingham is sthted thus far to have escaped very well the effects of the New York crisis. Bradford, it is feared, has sliffered to some extent, and at all points the cessation of orders from the United States is likely to cause inactivity during the next few months. In the general business of the port of London during the past week there has been little change. The total of ships reported Inward was 212, showing a decrease of 15 from the previous week. The number cleared outward was 109, including 20 in ballast, showing also a decrease of 14 The number of vessels on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 04, being 7 more than at the last account. Most of the engineering staff of the Ceylon Raiway embarked for Ceylon yesterday by the Australasian. MIr. Doyne, late head of the Army Works Corps in the Crimea, has been appointed chief engineer, and follows by the steamer of the 4th of November, with instructions to prosecute the works with the utmost vigour. It is said no further call is likely to be made this year.

THE CORY TRADE. _4h Af KM-L&NA MoNDAY AYTENooN. OCT.12. Onr supplies generialy lwac week wreo good, but lot heavy. The corn exporks wore nil. The receipts in English wheat were 6,636 quruter, Ili foregn 13,115. The samples from Esex and Kent this morning wore moderately abundant, with a good proporUoi fine; but, millers being reserved, sales oould only be mad by conceding fully 2s. per quarte. The foreig trade w&a exceedingly dull, and to sell newr smples a siarredn. tlon was neessary, with some abatement on old, Of contry flour there were 13,423 sacks, of foreIgn 29?, sxcks. Norrolks were s. per sck lower. The quantity oZ. foreign being very limited, prioes thereof, s well as ! town.made samples, were unchanged. The supply of Englsh barley waa 3,532 quartes oZ foreign 11,552 quarters. The bea maiting sorts were qufits as dea, but acnd qualities sold rather in buyere favour. The trade in malt was steady, without variation In pries . secondary sorts of new were, however, very dlficult t place.

BUCEB'S HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION IN ENGLANSD.* Mr. Buckle is engaged on a great task, under conditions which promise a masterly performance, and which up to this point have afforded us an instalment of more than ordinary value. Though unknown as an author, he has ambitiously undertaken to write the history of English civilization on a plan commensurate with the theme,-at all events, with a comprehensive conception and scope which, if he succeed in carrying out his intent, wiU entitle him to rank with considerable personages, including the historical philosophers of France and Germany,who are ordinarily more disposed than our own countrymen to engage in such lofty and ponderouis constructions. An idea may be obtained of the magnitude of the work in Mr. Buckle's hand when we mention that this f6rst volume of between 800 and 900 pages, contains only his " general introduction," or, as we find on turning to page 853, aportion only of this, which is again a preliminary to " the body of the worl," in which the principles will be applied which are here denoted and partially tested as the machinery of his investigations. If wo smile at such a forecast of the dimensions of a work which the author dedicates to his mother as a frst performance, we ~shall find, nevertheless, in its purpose and execution much to arouse both our interest and admiration. It would be easy, indeed, to point out its many defects and shortcomings, to question here and there not a few of its propositions, to object to Mr. Buckle's redundancy, to his invincible dogmatism, and especially to the dispropnortion which his digressions must bear to the entire work, if that work is to be ever completed; but ordinary criticism, or the result of incidental examination up and down, or in subordinate passages, would give a most unfaithful impression of a book which is truly greater as a whole than its parts, and of which none of the parts are as yet fuUy developed. The gathering together and the connecting of such vast and various materials upon any principles of arrangement, or with a view to any definite conclusions, is the achievement to which rather we ought to direct attention, and on the evidence of which thus far we should principaly insist; and still more ought we to sink all minor questions of difference, though we believe Mr. Buckle to he frequently mistaken, if in the main we find that the work is laid down upon true lines and, apart from subordinate errora and blemishes, promises on the whole to be a seaworthy construction. Its claims to originality in many of its parts ate really considerablo, but its originality even is best displayed in its system and method, in the conception by which it combines the discoveries and applies the researches of other mlnds to results to which they were already in obvious proximity; so that if, in fact, Mr. Buckle has been able to piece out here and there the recent conclusions of historicaland political philosophy, it is not on this account that we more particularly commendhim. Many of his most striking inferences were ready to his hand in the works of Guizot, Conte, Mill, De Quetelet, De TocqueviUe, and a dozen other pursuers of original inquiries; some of them even, to his apparent unconsciousness, are to be found pointed with clear and brilliant emphasis in a book so familiar as Michelet's brief Introduction to Universal History ; othe-s are expatiated on in Couin-, Buchez, and other conduits from the fountains of German philosoplhy; and it is not too much to affirm that the amount of original material-of bricks, that is to say, of Mr. Buckle's baking-will be foand to go for very little in his edifice. It is the collection and combination of the vast aggregate, the plan into which the materials are adjusted, or for their proper place in which they are shaped and labelled, which has the more considerable pretensions to novelty. The performance of lMr. Buckle is thus architectonic, and is entitled to higher or lower praise, not for the original elements which it comprehends, but according as we find his scheme more or less satisfactory. Thus, as in fact we have stated above, it is as a wlhole that from any point of view we oaught to consider it; and, having thus given the reasons which exempt it from ordinary criticism, and which render an observation f its defective parts as yet inadequate and unfair, we shall now give an outline of the conception which it undertakes to complete hereafter. Mr. Buckle commences by deploring the backwardness of history in comparison with other great branches of human knowledge. It is popular, and of the highest value, yet it has been hitherto written so indolently and empirically, on so narrow a standard, that in the whole literature of Europe there are not more than three or four really original works which contain a systematic attempt to investigate the history of man. Durlng the last hundred years there have, however, been various indications of an increasing comprehensiveness of view and purpose. Still a strenuous effort is wanted to bring up this great department of Inquiry to a level with other departments, in order that we may maintain the balance and harmony of our knowledge. Mr. Buckle then contends that the social phenomena with which history deals are only less capable of scientific classification in as far as they are more complex and 3eemingly irregular than physical data, and he closes directly withmetaphysicians and theologians by asserting the conclusion that the actions of men being ,determined by their antecedents must have a character of uniformity, and must, under precisely the same circumstances, issue in precisely the same results. These antecedents consist of the reciprocal action of external phenomena upon the mind, and of the mind uDon phenomena. Thus we have man modifying nature and nature modifying man; while out of this reciprocal modification all events must spring. The problem is to ascertain the laws of this double modification and the earliest inquiry is which of the two modification, is the more important. Are men more influenced by physical phenomena or physical phenomena by men? Mr. Buckle derives his outlines from this distant and transcendental region, and draws these at first on a questionable basls, but they begin to shape themselves more distinctly as he fills in his foundations. Thus he observes that the physical agents by which the human race is most powerfully influenced may be classed under the four heads of Climnate, Food, Soil, and the General Aqpe4 of Nature. The first three of these are in no small degree dependent upon each other, and of all the results which they produce in common the accumulation of wealth is the earliest and in many respeeta the most important. Without wealth there can be neither taste nor leisure for the acquisition of knowledge, on which it is his leading theorem that above all moral causes the progress of civilization almost exclusively depends. The energy and regularity with which labour is conducted, and, secondly, the returns made to that labour by the bounty of nature, are therefore at the root of all national and historic differences. Where climate renders continued agricultural industry impracticable to any degree, in Sweden and Norway, for example, as in Spain and Portugal, the people are remarkable for a corresponding Instability and fickleness of character. So, at least, says Mr. Buckle, as we conceive, with dubious warranty from the examples he has cited. But as to the consequences of climate and fertllity conjoined. in the main we must agree with him when we find the rude Arab, transferred from his arid deserts, was promoted in the scile of humanity at Cordova and Bagdad, or when we see the temperate zones of the earth alone in the fiat instance occupied by the higher forma of civilization, and only so occupied when their temperate climate was co-existent with .Considerable fertility. If, however, these two sources of civilization are compared, climate, which gives manwealth by stimulating his labour, is found more favourable to his ultimate progress than the agency of soil, which likewie gives him wealth less by exciting his energies than by thespontaneity of its productiveness. Accordingly, wherethe fertility of the soil exercised most iniluence, as in the ancient world, though civilization there took its earliest rorms, these were by no means the best or moat permanent. In Europe, on the cther hand, civilization, which in its earliest stage wtas governed by climate, has shown a capacity of developement unknown to those civilizations which were originated by soil. "For the powers of nature," says Mr. Buckle, " notwithstandlng their apparent magnitude, are limited and stationary; at all events, we have not the slightest proof that they have ever inoreased, or that they will ever be able to increase. But the powers of man, so far as experience and analogy can guide us, are unimited; nor are we possessed of any evidence which authorizes us to aaxgn even an imaginary b5undarSr at -ivh ch the humanintellect will of necesity be brought to a stand." Some limitations to ts bold aimerion *Eisto- of Oiaization in Bnglan4. By Henry Thomm Icl.v0 . Parker, 1857. will immediately suggest themselves; but for the purpoee for which Mr. Buckle employs it it may serve, nevertheless, to sustain a practical distinction. The great civilizations exterior to Europe which have been more affected by the powers of nature,tl} at is to say, by the peculiarities of food, soil, and I other physical agents,-have, at all events, been more stationary tian those of Earope have been. In the East certain of these peculiarities, as Mr. Buckle shows at great length-as, for example, a plentiful and oxydized food, of which little is required, and which makes population redundant and wages low-promoted an unequal distribution of wealth; others of them caused an unequal distribution of thought, by concentrating attention on subjects wbich inflame the imagination. In the Ancient World, where the proportions of physical facts were more imposing, man in the face of nature was weak, and at the same time oppressively conscious of his weakness. On the other hand, where the works of nature are small and feeble, man regains confidence, as Michelet and others have remarked with MIr. Buckle. If it is granted that there are certain natural phenomena which act on the human mind by exciting the imagination, it must be admitted also that those phenomena are much more numerous out of Europe than in it, and of all quarters that they are especially numerous in the East. Accordingly imagination ran riot in Indian literature, and even intoxicated its chronological and geographical systems, so that they overleapt the sober restraints of the meaBuring rod and the multiplication table. Imaginahon inspired religious fear, and superstition decorated Siva with his girdle of- snakes and his necklace of human bones, gave him a wife with blood-red palms, and propensities to match, and played other pranks at the expense of the terrified intloo. All this is perfectly true, as that in Greece, on the other hand, man took a bolder measure of his proportions, was encouraged by the safety and inertness of the material world to think more of Dersons than of things, to conceive Gods with human attributes, to worship heroes, to become sceptical, analytic, inductive, and to triumph over nature, which in Eastern history had triumphed over man. It was in Europe that man first succeeded in taming the energies of nature, bending them to his own will, turning them aside from their ordinary course, compelling them to minister to his hapPiL ness and subserve the general purposes of life. The traces of this glorious and successfl strugle are around us in the sea pumped out of HoUandin the vapour harnessed to the ship and to the car, in the lightning bearing our messages and the sunbeams painting our portraits, and the thousand other gains and triumphs of successive ages. The most cruel diseases, such as the plague, properly so called, and the leprosy of the middle ages, have disappeared; wild beasts and birds of prey have been extirpated; the frightful famines by which Europe used to be ravaged have ceased; engineering has overcome physical obstacles and provided physical facilities, canals for want of rivers, harbourm where harbours were not; and greater cities and greater riches thau in those countries where nature was most bountiful are now to be found in those countries where, on the other hand, man is most active. The powers of natare havenot increased, but bythe skdll and energy of man himself man's resources haveincreased, and are increasing indefinitely; whence it follows that as the influence of physical laws diminishes that of mental laws becomes more powerful, the triumph of the mind over external agents becomes the measure of civilization, and mental laws have only to be ascertained to be the ultimate basis of the history of Earope. Thus physical laws may be treated as now of minor importance, and as merely giving rise to disturbances, the force and frequeney of which have during several centuries perceptibly diminished. Unhappily for our case at this point, as respects mental laws, the netaph1ysi;cians cannet help us, for they proceed by two opposite methods to results hopelessly irreconcileable. E;tber they begin by examining their sensations or their ideas, and diverge from each other with a velocity which seems to be accelerated by the progress of knowledge. The idealists come to the conclusion that all men have essentially the same notion of the good, the true, andthe beautiful,while the sensationalists affirmthat there is no such standard. By the nature of the dispute it is impossible that any middle term can be found, nor can there ever be an umpire, because no one can mediate in metaphysical controversies without being a metaphysician, and no one can be a metaphysician without being either a sensationaUst or an idealist. Both partiea, however, conceive that menial laws can only be discovered by studying individual minds, and so discard the historical method, which arrives at its results by studying many minds in conjunction. Yet " the metaphysical method," says Mr. Buckle, "Is one by which no discovery has ever yet been made in any branch of knowledge . . Thera is not to be found in the whole compass of metaphysics a single principle of importance, and at the same time of incontestable truth." Thus we are required to dismiss the poor metaphysicianaswho were ready to offer us their opposite solutions of the historical problem, and we recur to the historic metnod of studying mental phenomena not simply as they appearin the mindofthe individual observer, but as they appear in the actions of mankind at large. Here we are offered the same certainty as to the conditions of social progress as from the aggregate of recorded examples we also obtain of the regiularity of the laws of nature under the most conflicting circumstances; for instance, of that law of the proportions of the sexes for which during many centuries men vainly searched till they inquired for and found. it by means of statistical data and comparisons. Proceeding, then, to investigate the laws of mental progress in this manner, we at once come upon the question of moral and intellectial influences, and have to decide which of them are the more imnportant to this progress. If we contrasthe stationary aspect of moral truths with the prospective aspect of intellectual truths, the difference is startling, and helps us presently to an answer. In reference to our moral conduct there is not a single principle now known to the most cultivated Europeans which was not likewise known to the ancients. In reference to the conduct of our intellect the moderns have not only made the most Important additions to every department of knowledge that the ancients ever attempted to study, 'but besdes this they have uDset and revolutionized the old methods of inquiry; they have consolidated into one great scheme all those resources of induction which Aristotle alone dimly perceived; and they have created sciences the faintest idea of which never entered the mind of the boldest thinker antiquity ever produced. Does it not follow that the changes in the state of society must depend principally on the changing element, that the advance in clvilzation must correspond with the advance in human knowledge, and that the standard of progress will be the amount and success of our intellectual activity ? This conclusion, together with others as to the limited influence, on the other hand, of such purely moral elements as philanthropical motives, may be no doubt unpalatable, but MIr. Buckle insist that " what makes them pewuliarly offensive is that it is impossible to refute them." For example the two greatest evils of those which wehave gradually mitigated which have afflicted the world are religious persecution and war; and by what means, Mr. Buckle very pertinently inquires, have we partially subdued these-by moral or intellectual agencies ? An overwhelming majority of religious persecutors have been men of the purest intentions; they have persecuted because of and in proportion to their sincerityand conscientiousness, and this will be found to have equally obtained in classic and Christian communities. Marcus Aurelius ani Julian, on theone hand, were keenly intent on crushing those whom Commodus and Elagabulus spared. On the other hand, in Christian Spain the members of the Inquisition, according to Llorente, its enemy, were aU of them men of worth, and most of them even of distinguished humanity. It was precisely the nation wbich produced the most ardent and disinterested missionaries, the most zealous and self-denying martyrs,in which the Inquisition was moatactive,and active by the influence of some of thevery best among them. The antagonist of intolerance, therefore, say3 Mr. Buckle, meaning, of course, its effectual antagonist, is not to be found in our moral repugnance to cruelty; to which position, again, we are obliged. to assent generally, though excepting to the unqualified form of Mr. Bucklde's own statement. Ii the same way, as respects war, Mr. Buckle implies that morale influences have had absolutely nothing to do with its diminutlon. Men, he says, hav nw from the farst that defensive wars were just, and that offensive wars were unjust, and it cannot be pro tended that the moderns hAve mAde mny discoveries respecting the moral evils of a state of warfare. Yet if, comparing one century with another, wars have steadily decreased, as is no doubt the case, an increasing sensitiveness to these moral evils may surely have had some share in their diminution. Mr. Buckle implies the contrary too rigidly, though, again, he is right in the main in referring the decrease of wars generally to increased knowledge. Every great increase in the activity of the human inteuect has, indeed, been a heavy bloW to the warlike spirit; it has added to the authority of the intellectual classes by amplifying the resources which they have to wield, and it has balanced the influence of the military class, after compelling them to recede from their ancient position of universal dominance. Their profession has no longer its universal attractiveness, and the warrior has no longer the universal pretensions of classic antiquity. Statesmen, orators, historians, poets, and philosophere, who then were generaUy soldiers, are rarely so in these days. Even soldiers able in their own profession have become more rare, because that profession is less commonly attractive. The invention of gunpowder first, indeed, made a professionz of the universal obligation to military service. In short, by a chymical discovery a division was first broadly established between the soldier and the civilian; immense bodies of men were gradually weaned from their old warlike habits, and employed in manufactures, trade, science, art, and literature. The study of political ecz,nomy then helped to remove the commerclal jealousies of nations. The application of steam to Itheir intercourse is counteracting their prejudices and destroying their contempt for each other; and where priests have preache an moralists admonished in vain, increasing knowledge thus mitigates strictly moral evils. The vices and virtues of individuals become of less and less importance to society, which regains its eguilibrium more easily after they have temporarily disturbed it. " The actions of bad men produce only temporary evilthe actions of good men only temporary goo. . . the discoveries of great men never leave us; they are immortal ; they contain those eternal truths wkich survivo the shock of empis, outlive the struggles of rival creeds, and witness the decay of successive religions. All these have their different measures and their difforent standardsone set of opinions for one age and another for another. They pass away like a dream * they are as the fabrio of a vision which leaves not a raci behind. The disooveries of genius alone remain; it is to them that wo owe an that we now have, they are for all ages and all times: never young and never old. they bear tho seeds of their own life; they flow on in a perennial and undying stream ; they are essentially cumulati7e, and, giving birth to the additions which they subsequently receive, they thus influenoe the niost dintaut posterity, and after the lapse of centuries produce more effoct than they were able to do even at the moment of their promulgation." Thus, then, we are put in possession of Mr. Buckle's fundamental position, that the key to the history of civilization consists in the investigation of the su3e3ssive movements of the human intellect. The actions of individuals are, indeed, affected in a great degree by their moral feelings and their passions; bat these being antagonistic to the passions and feelings of other individuals are balanced and neutralized, so that, as Mr. Buckle contends, their effect is in the great average of human affairs nowhere to be seen. The totality of human actions is governed by the totality of human knowledge, aud the progress of affairs depends on the progress of this knowledge-that is to say, on the number of truths which the human intellect discovers, and on the extent to which they are diffused. The history of any country s thus bound up more or less with the history of all, and Mr. Buckle confines himself to England with avowed reluctance, but with reasons for his preference, which he gives at considerable length. Its history he concludes to be of paramount importance, because it is more attributable to causes springing out of itself-that is to say, it has been less affected than any other by the two main sources of interference-namely, the authority of Government and the Influence of foreigners. The knowledge of which it was possessed has had freeer play, and the accumulation and diffusion of this knowlpdge have kept pace more equably. In Germany, on the one hand, accumulation has preponderated; its highest intellects have outstipped the general progress of the nation, and have ended by addressing themselves not to their country, but to each other. Hence their absence of practical knowledge and indifference to physical and material Interests. In America, on the other hand, the preponderance is altogether reversed; here the failure to accumulate is as serious an evil as the failure to diffase has proved to be in Germany. Account being taken al-m of France, Spain, and Scotland and their various peculiarities, Mr. Buckle concluaes that the history of England is that in which the harmony of different' principles has been most consistently maintained, and therefore, not from patriotism, he has selected it for investigation. Reverting again to preliminarie3s Mr. Buckle contends that the reliqion, literature, and legislation of this or of any country are more modified by the condition of its people, including, of course, the extent and diffusion of knowledge among these, than they are able themselves to modify that condition-a position by no means clearly sustained, though amounting, in other words, to the proposition that religion, literature, and legislation are more important as effects than as causes. The standard of progress in any countrymay,however, be gauged by these very incidents, as MYr. Buckle agrees in his deductions from the gradual changes in the mode of writing history. Thus history has been gradually assigning a greater importance to the condition of the people, the diffusion of knowledge included, and Mr. Buckle here employs his remarkable learning to register its errors and their significaut corrections. From the history of history he expands arbitrarily into an outline of the history of the English intellect from the middle of the 16th to the 18th century, and his seventh chapter of 150 pages, which contains this digression, is full of valuable materials, among which we may particularize the remarkable evidence of progress afforded by a comparison of Jewel with Hooker, and of Hooker with Chillingworth, the measurement of thisprogress within a single lifetime by the comparison of the Religio Medici with the vulgar errors of Sir Thomas Browne, and the measurement of a similar reaction by the sole productions of Edmund Burke. Mr. Buckle's episodes may be unreasonably long, and his own method so fataly excursive that it appears at first sight to be tantamount to an utter want of method; but his readers have at least this compensation for his digressions, that they abound withrare and choice matter, and fromresources whichareenormousderive principles and conclusions which are philosophically memorable. We defy Mr. Bockle to give us, in any reasonable compass, an analysis of his course which would be at all inteligible; yet we follow it with the greatest interest, as whichever way he turns, hither or thither, we are certain to be rewarded. When, pursuing his circuitous course, he crosses the Channel and proceeds to an outline of the history of French intellect from the middle of the 16th century, " with the light acquired by the normal condition of the English mind," we may demur to the change of scene, but we are absorbed and fascinated by the prospect afforded. We are taken abroad to observe, as compared with England, the stricter subjection of the French nation to the protecive spirit in its eccleIastical, aristocratical, and monarchical phases, and, as a preliminary, which it strikes us should have been a step in the process, we are then arrested for a hundred pages to remark the corresponding development of French and English intellect during the 70 yeanrs which succeeded tbe accession of Henry IV. From ltsbelais to Montaigne, and from Montaigne to Descartes, the intellectual movement in France is as clearly gauged as that in England had been by the differences between Jewel, Hooker, and Chillingworth. Then we follow its influence on the march of events from the wars in which religion was the cause and pretext, through the intermediate policy of Richelieu, to the doys of the Fronde, when religion was no longer either. The tendencies of the two nations, whatever the circumstances c.f their variation, are thus found to have pursued the same order of development in their scepticism, their knowladge, their literature, and their toleration. In both countries there broke out a civil war at the same time, for the same object, and in many respects under the same ircumstances. In both the insurgents, at first triumphant, were afterwards defeated; and the rebellion being pnt down, the Governments of the twor nations were fully restored aln~ost at the same moment-in 1.660 by Charles II., iW- 1661 by Louis XIV. 'I-But there the similarity stops, and having noted this ex- ceptionable resemblance we ae allowed to proceed with our inquiry, that is to say, we are again taken back several centuries to explain the causes of this national. divergence. Hlere, then, is the object for which we crossed the Channel to note the influence of the pr tedtive spirit, which Mr. Baklde says "1mry truly becalled an evil spirit," and which has always been far stronger in Francethan in England. Mr. Buckle then assigns the predominance of this spirit in the former country to the greater strength and independence of its feudal aristocracy from an early date. In England, as ho truly states, the nobles having been weakened by William the Conqueror, and being subsequently too foeble to contend with the Crown, were compelled in self-defence to ally themselves with the people. Hence, he derive3, perhaps, more conrueice3 than this circumstance alone would warrant, though he is right in ascribing much to the greater power of the French nobles, and to the fact that thoy were hardened into a distinct and domineering caste; while " our municipal privileges, the rights of our yeomanry, and the security of our copyholdern were from the 14th to the 17th centuries the three most important guarantees for the liberties of England." Hence chivalry, which was the offspring of the aristocratic element, had proportionately far more influence in medimval Erance, obtained there its chief chroniclers, its Joinvilles and Froissarts, with its model knight Bayard, endured longer and later, and has transmitted a more definite impulse to Gallic society.1 Hence the differenee in the English and French Rebellions-the one democratic, the other aristocratic ; the one trampling over an aristocracy whom the Tudors had already humbled, the other simply impelling one part of the aristocracy against the other in a resistance to their feudal superior the King. In the one country we find that a very remarkable proportion of leaders from the lower ranks teok almost the entire conduct of the English rebellion. In the other the leaders of the Fronde as oxclusively consisted of dukes, princes, and marquises,andeeremonial grievancesoccupid theirminds andwsatedthelrnoble energies while E5ngland was contending for the solid essentials of liberty. When, therefore, the Fronde was fioally overthrown everything was preparedfor that singular mtellectual polity which during 50 years characterized the reign of Louis XIV., and which was to French literature what feudalism was to French politics. It has been ascribed, indeed, as a merit to the Grand Monarque, that he organized his protection to literature into a system, but Mr. Buckle proves clearly by an extraordinary aceumulation of evidence-first, that nearly all the literary and artistic glories of the reign of Louis were the inal effulgence of the 7egite of Richelien and Mazarin; and, secondly, that in the latter half of his reign, when his own sstem had had full play, there was an unmistakeable collapse; while the entire absence during his time, not only of great discoveries, but also of mere practical ingenuity, was another indication of the dearth which he inflicted. Mr. Backle supports these positions by an array of namaes and dates which urge conviction on those most reluctant to credit the novelty that the reign of Louis XIV. was as detrimental to French intellect as it was ruinous to the Governmental system and material resources of the French empire. From the death of Louis we are led on to the first stirrings of the great reaction, which are again illustrated by that profusion of closely-condensed facts which makes this work so valuable, irrespective of its ground plan. Here Mr. Buckle lays especial stress on that influence of English views with the leaders of French civilization which he estimates as the most important fact in the history of the 18th century. The -union between the French and English minds which then took place, though often noticed, has never, he says, been examined with the care its importance deserves, and we must fairly add that we have never seen it examined with half the research which he himself brings to its elucidation. He then overwhelms us with the evidence of the crael persecution to which literature was exposed ia its first efforts at revival-a persecution which we are too apt to forget in the spectacle of its excesses in the hour of its assured triumph. Then we are shown the rise of historical ecepticism and the changes in the method of writing history sp by atop frem Du Haillan through De Thou, Suy, Sevres, IDuplelx, La Popelini?re, De Rubis, Gomberville, Berthault, Mezeray, Audigier, and Bossuet down to the [progress in Voltaire's own writings and to Montesquleu and Turgot, to the latter of whom the creation of the philosophy of history has been sometimes ascribed. Then our attention is directed to the turning point of 1750, when the French intellect began to make the State instead of the Church its object of attack, and the reprieve of the ecclesiastical order for nearly 30 years is attributed with great penetration to the fact that at no period during the 18th century did the speculative classes and practical classes thoroughly combine against it; since in the first half of the century the clergy were principally assailed by the literature, and not by the Government; in the lattor half of the century by the Government, and not by the literature. Then we pass to an estimate of the influence of the Economists, of Rousseau, of the extraordinary impulse given to every branch of physic&l science, of the growth of Calvnim among the French clergy, and of the news of the American rebellion. The causes of the revolution thus inquired into are presented to us againand again in unfamiliar aspects,and thewhole are drawn together into a great testimony of our progress, and its dependence upon the Qccum'ulation. and djusion of our knowfledge, of which we can say that it carries us out of the sphere of party to heights from which we can survey with confidence the march of human affairs through the dust of ages to the great goal of liberty, humanity, and peace. The remaining part of this introduction, which is yet unpublished, is to be devoted to an investigation of the civilization of Germany, A merica, Scotland, and Spain, and the causes of their differences are to be ascertained and goneralized. Thefundamental laws of European thought being thus obtained, as MIr. Buckle calculates, are to be applied to the History of English Civilization to which he proposes ultimately to confine his labours. His outline is immense, and with his mode of filling it up we may speculate on his incurring the reproach of the satirist- "Aub summi plen jam margine lbri, "Scrlptus, et in tergo, necdum finitus OrestesW" But if life prove too short for the completion of such a project, its offorts will not be wasted where so much is already accomplished. Had Mr. Buckle a closer method, could he compress his arguments as he marshals his faets, or could he associate himself with anyone who could render him this assistance; not only would the prospect of his completing his work be increased, but it would be far more welcome and valuable to students in consequenee. Ib has other defects, but this is its chief fault, annd this is remediable. With all its merits we wish that the book could be entirely re-written; but with aU its defects we shall watch its continuance with the keenest interest, for it is one of those Droductions which fairly make a reputation at a bound, which are a credit to any nation or to any literature.
FORT GEORSR ARD THE HIGHLAND DZPOZ'S. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It is the duty of every tre patriot, especially at such a critial perlod as the present, to do or say all he cau that may tend to promote the welfare of his contry. It ia under such convlction, then, that I solicit the favour of a space in your columns for this simple suggestlon. It has already X-= hinted by one of your orrespondents that the dep6ts of EHghlnd regiments, tho service companies of which are in India, and whieh aro at present stationed in Aberdeen, might be profitably ceatred In Fort George, while the militia regiments of some of the adjacent countiss might be raised and stationed in Aberdeen, Pertb, Stirling, &a , whence the Highland dep6ts might be liberally supplied with volunteers This would undoubtedly be an excellent plan, one not only convenient and profitable to Government, but at the same time advantageous to the recruit. The accommodation In Aberdeen is Insufficient for six depots, and much inconvenience and want of comfort 1 already experienoed there on that account. If that is the case when the depOts are so weak, what wviJ it be when they are raised to their foll complement-1,200? There must evidently be come alteration. The battalion musb elther be divided or removed to some more capaclous station. Whera is there a more suitable place than Fort George-where there Is ample field for musketry practice, now so justly valued; and where the recruit may be more perfectly drilled by being as it were isolatOd from temptation? I sincerely hope the Government wil take the cse Into consideration, and come to the good and wise conclusion of sending these depbts onward to Fort George, where there is such faeility for maidng the soldier what his nakme implies. and thus enabling him to sustin and evinenhance that renown which iz already eharactpristio of the Highianders 1.x the far East, Yours vero resnectfullv. 0. .LF.

LONDON, TUBSDAY. OCTOBEB A 1857. Another mail has come, and then another mail upon it, with news from every quarter of the disturbed provinces, and with a most gratifying announcement, very lete indeed, from the garrison of Lucknow, though without informing us of any substantial change in the position aud prospects of the war. We at home are indeed better pleased to hear that that garrison was safe on the 2d ult., lems than six weeks ago, that it had made a second successful sortie, capturing two guns, and bringing in a large supply of provisions, and that there was good hope of their relief in the middle of the month, than we should have been to bear of another glorious, but unprofitable victory, in the open field. Elsewhere, though the end is not yet, everything is tending to it. Indeed, no historian, no dramatist, no poet ever so suspended the interest, so spun out the preparations, and kept the antagonists so long on the start, as is done by the natural course of events in this war. Time is now in our favour; we everywhere hold out, persevere, gan courage and confidence. are reinforced from the mountains or the ocean; and grow continually more and more terrible in the eyes of the foe. To the arrivals from the Punjab, from Nepaul, from Madras, China, and Ceylon, we may now add whole regi;ents foro the Cape, and the head of the great column from this country. The arrival of 2,500 troops at Mauritius is an earnest of what we may now hope for every mail. Yet t}ae work is still all to come. On all sides it is the note of preparation, the catalogue of the forces, the gathering of the hosts-nothing complete, critical, and decisive. The siege train was still to arrive at Delbi, and the assault was then' to be made. This was indeed no illusion. On the contrary, the mutineers, having gone out from Delhi to intercept the dreaded messengers of their doom, suffered a great loss of men, guns, and baggage. Everywhere it is the same. We are face to face with one another at a hundred points, collecting strength and maaturing our plans. Whichever side terapts a collision, the triumph is uniformly ours, as if to assure the mutineers that they must wait their trial and then their doom. Our people have gone out from Agra in force, and routed a body of the insurgents. Major Exnx has again defeated the mutineers from Dinapore. Fresh, but not unexpected mutinies In the Punjab, have been speedily extinguished. Thus the intelligence is throughout far more satisfactory and hopeful than we could have ventured to expect, and it is impossible not to feel that we have now broken the back of this teirible affair. Nevertheless, there is this peculiarity in the news before us-that it leaves the two sides much where it found them,that is, nearly in the same position and in the same force, with no fortress captured, no territory won, no ormy destroyed. Though the rebels were everywhere beaten, there they still were; and at the very time that OuIRAa waa advancing from Allahabad to Cawnpore it was saidE that the former place, aa well as Benares, was threatened by the insurgents of Oude. The real change is that, while recovering ourselves, uniting, and slowly augmenting the small bands that have hitherto waged unequal war with the hosts around them, these hosts are themselves melting away. They are not like the smoke of the genie that took form and substance and became a giant; they only rise to evaporate. They may be said to be without form and void. A common cause they cannot have, az the Hindoos can only co-operate with the Muasulmans, and the MIussulmans with the Bindoos, with the efcret intention of getting rid of the other at the first convenient opportunity. There has been no manifesto, except a story of greased cartridges, which none believed, and the proclamation of a King whom none respected. There bas been no general except NiwAi SAHnB, for the names mentioned at Delhi are those of humble men, and change from *ay to day. There has been no plan of operation, except that they who don't know what else to do flock to Delhi, where they are not always comfortable or welcome,-where, indeed, they don't always stay. It is true that we hear of the mntineers everywhere; we may encounter them everywhere; but everywhere they are scattered and dissipated, to turn up somewhere else. At this moment it would not be safe to say that the insurgents of Oude are not on their way to Delhi, or that the garrison of Delhi is not on its way to Oude. The insurgents of Oude also threaten Ailahabad and Benares. The mutineers of Dinapore diffused an extensive panic down the river, but have been beaten twice higher up. Thus the foe we have to deal withnameless, causeless, pointless, and aimless-is desultory as a vapour, shallow as an inundation. Never was anything of such formidable dimensions so destitute of consistency. A great people or a great cause will in time find a great General, and so win the day. But, even if the Sepoys should have the luck to find a great soldier, they have not in themselves what he could take hold of. He might as well attempt to grasp a mist, or to command a shoal of herrings. Their faint traditional loyalty to some names and sites would afford but slight groundwork for discipline or government. The weak, listless, vapouring throng would resent efficien' command as a worse bondage than the old one. So little solidity or principle is observed in the mutinees, and so little power of turning their opportunities to account, that it has been thought not improbable they will all disperse on the arrival of our reinforcements, or proffer their submission. They may not take either of the-e courses, for they may not be able to do the one, or hrve encouragement to do the other; but it is confidently expected that they will make no stand. Does not this prove the worthlessness of their cauise, and the justice of ours? If they have a lightcous quarrel, what is it? If they have any principle of unity why does it not appear? If they have great names, stifled heroism, crushed nobility, or any other good thing that we have not aclnowledged, now is the time for it to be seen. Yet there is nothing of the sort. The only displays of anything like enthusiasm have been of the most atrocious cbaracter-at Delhi, Jhansi, Cawnpore, and several other places, wl'ere massacres have been perpetrated. Here the fire has broken out, and there is at least earnestness. Here they must have a real quatrel with us. Then, what is it ? At these places the grievance is an assumption of the sovereign rights of certain native Princes. This, in the abstract, is a fair quarrel enough, though, in fact, we have only used the common right of war, or taken the forfeit of broken treaties, or interfered for the common good, in support of order against anarchy and outrage, and no sooner than was neceesary. But it is enough that we are not at war anywhere with the people. We are not at war with the country round Delhi, or even with the general inhabitants of Delhi. We are not at war with any country, even with Oude. The garrison of Lucknow no sooner broke through the circle of their besiegers than they found the resources of the country at their disposal. We are only at war with a definite number of regiments of idle and pamperedsoldiers,with certain pretenders and.theirarmed bands, who have profited by the disturbance, ve been drawn into it, and with a few, very few, mere fanatics and enthusiasts animated by a religious zeal. Thus, on the whole, there is an utter want of that common cause, that sense of justice, that nationality, or that religion, which in other instances has bonded myriads into a suecessful or desperate resistance to the invader or the oppressor. We have against us a dlsunited crowd, which has renounced its flag in sheer restlessness and wantonness. Like a silly truant, it has taken a holyday, and knows not what to do with it. It is now at large, and only experiences the miseries of liberty without principle. It encounters us every now and then, but without heart, and therefore wit'aout sucecss. It flies because it cannot stand before us; it reassembles round its flags because it has nowhere else to go to, and is waylaid and robbed by the very villagers; it returns to the war because it hes nothing else to do. That, indeed, wil be its course, and the natural death of the mutiny. Every Sepoy fights -with a halter round his neck; he knows it; yet he cannot but fight and be beaten.
We give insertion this morning to a communi. cation from Colonel SyKEs on a subject -which is certain, even apart from the recommendation of so eminent an authority, to attract the attention of our readers. The object of the letter is to remove some misconceptions vhich Colonel SYKES believes to prevail respecting the operation of caste in disqualifying its votaries for nilitary service, and a memorandum is given from an officer of experience in the Bengal Army, testifying by actual example to the aptitude of the high-caste Sepoy for the several duties of a soldier. To the allegations contained in this document we readily give credit, though the value of its concluding paragraph is somewhat impaired by the fact that this mail and the last brought information of a mutiny in the very legion thus specially eulogized. When, however, Colonel SYIxS proceeds to inquire "what more could be " desired or expected from native soldiers" beyond the qualifications so described, we are compelled to remark that the Government and people of this country are not unlikely to desire and expect a good deal more than this from the troops to be hereafter iatrusted with the protection of ludia. What, let us ask, in the first place, can be thought of men whose willingness to perform the very first and simplest duties of soldiers is actually matter of controversy, affirmed by some and denied by others ? What idcea will Englishmen form of a regiment concerning which it is neceshary to assert, by the aid of elaborate and not uncoatradicted testimony, that its men do not refuse to dig the ground and stand shoulder to shoulder on parade ? We should rather expect and desire that such extremely ordinary duties should be performed so regularly, invariably, and mechanically aa never to occasion the slightest observation on the subject; whereas the truth. appears to be that though the high-caste Sepoy can, aud does, when he so pleases, dispense witl many of the obligatioa w1sIh hi, 119eWIIheX prta forward, he doe§ &b9s where be discerns his opportunity, make the same prejudices a pretext for purposes of his own. We do not doubt the accuracy of Colonel SYKEs's correspondent ; in fact, Colonel JAcoB, in the memoir which we published on the 12th of last month, uses the very same argument, and alleges exactly similar facts, to show how craftily the institution of caste is employed by the Hindoo soldier. In Eome quarters-as in the Bombay Presidency, and, as it now appears, in Joudpore-he can drop many of his caste prejudices, and conduct himself I like a sensible creature ; but in others, and most especially in Bengal, where he feels the preponderance of strength to be on the side of Brahminism, he asserts the demands of caste so unconscionably that no amount of concession can keep pace with his exactions. We do not doubt that Brahmin and Rajpoot Sepoys have handled shovels in JoudpQre, but neither do we doubt that they have refused to do so elsewhere; nor can we say that our respect for caste is much enhanced by this evidence that in many of its nmanifestations it can be put on and off at pleasure. This, however, is but one branch of the question, and not the most serious or comprehensive. Colonel SYKES, after thus expi'ining the services to which a " high-caste native soldiery really wilU" condescend, under the favourable circumstances of "C judicious" management, proceeds to remark upon the prejudices which stand upon a different footing, and which the Sepoy can not be expected to surrender. We miight easily take exception at this point to the qualifications of recruits who, if even they consented to go on board ship, would be liable to voluntary starvation, and exposed without remedy to debilitating sufferings from the minute they embarked; but the subiect calls for a broader and firmer grasp than can bo obtained by dialectiea subtleties. We maintain that, according to Colonel SYKES's own showing in this very letter, according to the representations which he himself would give of the facts, the high-caste Sepoys of Hindostan are not a class of men who cail be prudently invested with military power, or charged with the defence of our Eastern dominions. Our correspondent observes, with perfect accuracy, that cedtain alimerts are held, not only by Hindoos, but by other races and communities of men, to be so impure as only to be eaten under penalties of the most terrible kind ; and he argues, with equal justice, that to enforce such a breach of Divine or traditionary law upon any native in our service would be an act of tyrannical iniquity. To bring the question at once to a practical issue,-if the British Government, knowing the prejudices entertained, however irrationaUy, by the high-caste Sepoys to the use of cow's fat, had persisted wilfully and obstinately in driving them to defile themselves -with this obnoxious substance, it would certainly have done wrong-wrong not only in a political, hut in a moral sense; and, though not even such a proceeding could have justified the shocking barbarities which have been committed, we might certainly discover some excuse for the disobedience of the soldiers in our pay. So far we coincide entirely with Colonel SYKEs; but when he proceeds to assume that the men characterized by these prejudices are nevertheless fit men to form a Bengal army withal, we must express our absolute dissent from his opinions. It is not merely the possession of prejudice, but the liability to panic, which renders the Sepoy so objectionable ar. instrumert. It is not simply that he adheres implicitly to his caste, but that he is constantly ready to believe in the designs of others to destroy it, and that under the influence of such a delusion he becomes something worse than a madman and more savage than a tiger. it would be troublesome enough to have soldiers whose utility would depend upon the quality of a cask of grease, but the case is far worse when the results of carelessness or mistake in such a matter prove utterly irremediable, whrn they may even occur without any cause whatever, and when in practice they are pushed unhesitatingly to the length of universal treason and detestable atrocity. The Sepoy was 71ot required or compelled to bite cartridges greased with cows' fat. In this respect no wilful offence was ever given; and, as a matter of fact, the greased cartridges had ceased to be served out at Umballah after the middle of February, and the cartridges for refusing which the troopers were ordered into irons at Meerut on the 9th of May were the old cartridges of the identical description in use for years. But Colonel SxS wiU say that if the Sepoys believed in the destructive nature of the articles in question their terror was quite as natural as if the danger had been real, and that if we gave reason, however unintentionally, for such belief, we were answerable for the consequenceg. On this point, also, we join issue at once, and affirm distinctly that it is inconsistent with the very rudiments of political wisdom to arm, discipline, and organize by t.ousands a race of men so credulous, so senseless, so liable to frenzy, and so certain when frenzy seizes them to plunge into the most dreadful excesses of cruelty. Admit that we made a mistake about the cartridges, and somehow or other forgot for the moment that we were using the wrong fat in the manufacture, ought such a slip to have brought upon us mutiny and massacre, ruthless butchery, and indiscriminate revolt ? It is here that the operation of caste is so terrible. Colonel SYKES, at any rate, is well aware that, whatever may be the persuasions of Rindoos-and we assume for argment's sake the sincerity of such alarms-the idea of destroying caste by authoritative intervention was never entertsined by the Indian Government for a single moment; Indeed, an admirable letter which we published on Friday from Air. J. L. TnOMAS shows.i to what indignities we have subnitted rather than incur even the susp;cion of such a designL Yet, after a century of this policy-after the most anxious and indulgent deference to the prejudices of caste, we are not only believed guilty on the first imprefsion, but all our explanations and concessions are rejected, and we are pursued to the dc ath by the whole swarm of soldiery whom we have been pampering and conciliating for years. This is the true disqualification of the high-caste Hindoo, and it is nothing less thau fatal. We set aside for the moment the eaptioiusness and uncertainty of his general disposition, and point only to the panics by which at any minute he may be seized, and against which no possible solicitude can suesfeully guard. We say that it will never do again to have an army of men 100,000 strong who may any day conceive that we are plotting the destruction of what they call their " caste," who will noi be persuaded by any experience or arguments to the contrary, and who will forthwith give their conceptions a practical expression in the foulest abominations of treason ara& murder. The ideas of such men amount to moral epilepsy, and the disease is too perilous to be admitted into the ranks of an army. The morme saerci the souree the more dangerous is the delu'1ion, and, though the aspect of such evils may -well incite us to the work of relief where it can safely be attempted, it ought to make us eautiouw!, in the extreme in the use of such explosive materlals. " Relianee" must indeed be placed to som'j extent upon " native" levies, but they shoulda be auxiliaries only, and disconnected as much as possible from the operation of caste.. The title, of " a Bengal Army" will be assigned, we trur.t, for the future to a European force alorn.
In Ithe most mnonotonous season ever known, while all thoughts and all conversations are coaI cvItrMted on &, piuIq subject, ia the prmaeng% of anxieties more urgent than those of the Crimeau winter, and of dangers unlnown siuce the close of the eighteenth century, Lord BnOUGo has gallantly attempted to divert public attention to noame of the ordinary topics of diseussion. During this week a Congress or Assciationl is to meet at Birmingham for the purpose of c llecting and diffusing information on the principal questions which may be considered independent of domestic or foreign politics. Law reform, education, the prevention of crime, the reformation of crminals, sauitary systems, and social problems in general, have not in recent times been condemned to the obloquy of silence. The reader of newspapers may probably labour under the impresAion that a large portion of his life has been spent in studying speeches and essays on all these subjects; and he cannot but be aware that innumerable societies and meetings have firnished an opportunity for debates on similar themes which ought to have been practical and instructive. His general faith in the progress of enlightenment, in useful knowledge, and in Lord BROuGnAm may, nevertheless, reconcile him to the scheme of a societas societatum in which al conceivable social theories are to undergo contemporaneous discussion. It is scarcely fair to be too exacting with the proiectors of social science. Prison Discipline and National Schools admit of no process of demonstration, but speculations and suggestions and the results of expelience may possibly be valuable and instructive. It is true that they have aU been published before-that the amendment of the law has nothing to do with the drainage of London, and that education and the reformation of criminals are unconnected with each other and with the general business of the Congress. Natural science is always tending to unity. Social and political problems admit only of an empirical solution; yet it is dee;rable to bring various miuds to bear on inquiries of this nature ; and if the circumstances of the time are not too unfavourable Lord BROUGAsi's new form of agitation may possibly not be quite so unprofitable as sceptics are inclined to suppose. The use of societies and of public celebrations of this kind is to encourage the real agents of social reformation by the assurance that their labours are more or less appreciated by the world at large. The noblemen and gentlemen who make speeches about prison discipline and education know much less of the difficulties and peculiarities of the subject than a turnkey or a country vicar; but they supply the connecting link between the machinery which executes the work and the povwer of opinion and of political organization which sets the wheels in motion. If Lord BRouGHAM and his coadjutors animate half-a-dozen silent philanthropists to renewed exertion, their orations and statistics wvil not have been brought to Birmingham in vain. Jt would be idle to expect any novelty in the different departments. The British A-sociatlon announces the discovery of new planets, the revelation of additional nebule, fresh applications of electro-magnetism, or undiscovered indications of its connexion with the other great agents of the universe; but neither Lord BROUGHAM nor Lord JoisL RussELT, neither Sir J. PAxIxGTo2i nor Lord STAXLBY, can say anything about education which has not been said a hundred times before. The representatives of pure and applied science are the natural advisers of Government on all questions within their peculiar competence. Sir JOHN E[RSCELL, Mr. FARADAY, and Mr. Ow,-, are entitled to respectful attention when they recommend the expenditure of public money for purposes of useful experiment. Members of Pariiament cannot change their character by ascending a Birmingham rostrum. If their opinions are unpopular in the House of Commons, their influence wliU not be increased by the assumption of a quasi-scientifPc character. Crotchets on education and on crime wliU stiUl be considered crotchets, although they may be delivered under the sanceion of a solemn association. Possibly the telegraph wiUl defeat the philosophers. Not a member of the Congress will listen to ditquisitions on social reform, if there is a rumour of great news from India. Education and sanitary improvement are interesting subjects, but the capture of Delhl is more pressing. Yet there is one important question which may possibly receive some light from recent experience. Theorists on criminal jurisprudence have speculated on the necessity of discouraging crime, and on the duty of reforming criminals. The national indignation against the Indian mutineers may, perhaps, revive the ancient belief that it was the first purpose of punishment to punish, and that retributive justice primarily consists in simple retribution. The culprits of Cawnpore might almost be trusted to the mercies o. a jury of Quaker ladies. It is to be hoped that no man would forgive the murderers of women. It is certain that no Englishwoman would be content with the escape of the wretches who slaughtered and mutilated unoffending children. The stern satisfaction of righteous vengeance, wholly unmixed with any desire for the benefit of the criminals, will be but remotely connected with the desire of security against future revolts. The death of the ringleaders and of all actual sharers in the outrages, the lifelong slave labour of the ordinary culprits under the whip of a negro overseer, wiU be demanded by a more sacred and primitive instinct of justice than any which is likely to bs discussed at Birmingham. The same principle applies to more pardonable and commonplace offences; nor would social philanthropy find it easy on any other theory to justify the arbitrary infliction of pain. Nevertheless it is right to investigate the responsibilities which a tend on every exercise of absolute power. The magistrate and the gaoler have the entire disposal of the criminal, and when he is destined to return to society they are bound to take care that he is at least not deteriorated by his imprisonment. It is probable that benevolent and sagacious men, familiar with prison discipline, may be able to correct many prevailing errors in their peculiar department. Lord BRouGHAn offers to provide them and their fellow-labourers in severat other fields of useful activity with a voice and with an audience. The experiment, under existing circtimstances, is bold; but even if it fails it will probably be harmless.
The duties of a trustee are not unfrequently as perplexing as they are thankless, especially whew the nature of the trust iurolves the distribution of public money. The records of the Charity Cosw inissioners, as well as of other public departmQats, contain numberless instances of the failUe of public charities from the mere want of claitmants, and the chief difficulty in administering suzi funds has usually consisted in bringing together the money devised and the parties for Whom it was intended. We therefore claim the indulgence of our readers while we call their attention to tho position which we ourselves occupy in this important capacity, and to the manner in which we are endeavouring to fulfil its duties. It will be remembered that during the crisis of the Crimean campaign a large sum of money was placed at our dispoeal by the generosity of tho public for the relief of our sick and wounded soldiers at the seat of war. The Fund was administered by a gentlemoan eminently qualified for the task, whom we despatched to the scene of action, and whose judicious arraugemenlts rendered it u analuabie boou to out Sfng otynen The success of M£r. M&cDoAlD's mizsioli ecotu. raged R renewal of the experiment, amd a second fund was raised with the same benevoleit &bject. By the time, however, that our second Commis. sioner, Mr. STowz, reached his destinatiow he found that the arrival of Government suppie sd in a great measure superseded the necemity fdr voluntary assistance; and his untimely death, which occurred shortly afterwards, preventedthe completionof the work ini which he had engaged, and placed at our disposal a large surplus of the Fuad which he had been commissioned to administer. How to dispose of this surplus has caused us no little embarrassment. The immediate object for which it was raised having been satisfied, hoiv were we to decide among the crowd of candidates who might apply for a share of the balance T' 0a the one hand, it appeared to us uselers to fritter away a large sum in petty contributions to .a multitude of objects, and, on the other, hazardous to embark the whole in a single enterprise, however specious and attractive. After much deliberation, we have decided upon the following plan, which appears to us to combine the advantage of ministering to a pressing emergency with that of permanent usefulness:_ We have ascertained from the bankers with whom the Pund was lodged that the balance in their hands amounts, with interest, to 10,9081. 18s. 6d. Of this sum we propose to band over 3,64Z1. l5s. 8d.to the Committee for Adriinistering the Indian Relief Fund, with the express understanding that tbree-fourths of it shall be applied to the relief of the widows and orphans of soldiers who may fall in the present war, or of wounded or invalided soldiers who have no other means of support. The remainder of the balance we propose to assign to the Governors of the new Military Hospital at Netley, for the purpose of providing an auxilMary fund for the general purposes of the hospital. We trust that this arrangement will in the main be deemed satisfactory by those -whose bounty placed so large a fund at our disposal, though we are perfectly sensible that, in adopting it, we may have overlooked other objects of charity which in the eyes of some persons may possess equal or superior claims.

LoBD BPxoucimm.-We learn from the CaGrlisle Patriot tbhat for some time past it bas been the desire of gentlemen oonnected with the coanties of Cnamberland and Westmorland to give a public dinner at Penrith in henour of Lord Brougbam. The mstter has now assumed a tsngible form. The noble and learned lord has accepted the Wvitation for Wednesday, the 28th inst., and the arrancements will be commensurate with the great interest of ieo occasion, the only difficulty being the obtainment of a suitable dining saloon large enough to accommodate the great number of persons that wiU be buro to press for admission. The tribute is offered to his Lordship by men of all parties, simply as a mark of respect to a nobleman closely connected with the eounties, whose talents and unwearied exertions in the cause of education and social lmprovement are so consplicuous, and wil be entirely free from all party or political bias.

EDUCATIOx OF THE CHILDR OF Mm Rs.- Yesterday a meeting was held in Leeds, in connesion with the West Yorkshire Northern Association, for awarding prizes to the childron of persons employed in coal and iron. stone mines, when a number of prizes, vaing from 1U. to 51., together with certificates, wore distributed. The examination took place a few days previously, when 27 candidates offered, and it was conducted by the Rev. F. Watkin, one of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools. On the whole. the result was satisfactory, for though the pupils were deficient in special subjects they were well up in elementary trainiDg. Ten prizes were awarded, and they were yestsbday distributed in the presence of several of the clergy and gentry of the district. The object of the association is similar to that of those established, by Mr. Tremenheere in, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Warwiekahire, and Worcestershire, and which have been atteonad with so much success in improving the educational staL-as of the rising population of thos distreet, SUnDP3x DXAinT OF A PCo}OTn O'ricm-Mr. W.

The folloving is the supplementary despatch of Captain L'Estrange, 5th Fusileers, to the commanding officer at Dinapore relative to the relief of Arrah "Camp Arrah, August 5. "Sir,-When I had the honour of addressing you on the -inorning of the 3d inst. from our camp near this place I was so extremely anxious to fiuish my despatch and include it with that of Major Eyre, that time did not permit me to do more than record the services and gallantry of the officers belonging and attached to the detachment of the 5th Fusileers which was under my command on the eventful day of Sunday, the 2d inst. It is with feelings of the greatest pleasure that I have now to speak of the eminent services which were rendered to our force by Captain the Eon. B. P. Hastings, from the first moment -when our expedition was projected up to the present time. The gallankry of this officer was so conspicuous that it excited u.niversal admiration, while I can at the same time assert with equal confidence that nothing could have surpassed the exertions which he made for our men during their long 3nd fatiguing march, followed as it was by the hard fought imntest against hoAs of rebels and marauders. As I have before observed, I was unable in my despatch from the camp to give you these details of the obligations under which we are to our Acting Quartermaster-General, and at the same time I have to request you will consider this report as supplementary to my previous one.

THfE SUPPOSED MURDER. THE CORONE'S NoTrnwv Yesterday afternoon Mr. Bedford, the coroner for the City of WeMtminster, held an inquest at the boardroom of the Strand tUrsion, Bow-street, on the remains of the body of the individual, name unknown, which were found on an abutment of Waterloo-bridge on priday morning last. The excitement caused by the discovery of this horrible murder-for such the medical testimony given at the inquest proves it to have been-showed itself in the neighbourhood where the inquiry took place, and where a considerable number of persons had collected. The boardroom was also crowded throughout the whole of the inquiry. The jury having been sworn proceeded to view the clothes of the deceased and the remains of the body which were found In the carpetbag. The former wore displayed upon a table in the yard of Bowstreet police station. The latter (also at the same place) were taken from the pan of salt and water in which they have hitherto been kept, and ranged upon two tables in proper order, with the exception of the miming bones. It is needless to dwell upon the harrowing and a-wful sight which they presented. The jury having performed this sickening portion of their duty retuxned to the boardroom, when the inquiry was proceeded with. The first witness called was a lad named James Barber, who said,-1 am a labourer work'ng for Messrs. Smith and Sons, coal merchants, and live in Lumley. court, Strand. I was rowing up the river in a boat from Richmond on Fj iday morning last, between 5 and 6 o'clock, when I noticed a bundle lying on its side on the third abutment of Waterloo-bridge. When I first saw it I was two arches away from it. I rowed to it with Frank Hilsby, who was in the boat with nie, and found it was a carpetbag -the carpetbag now produced. I took hold of a cord which was lying in the water fastened to the bag, and we both got the bag into the boat, and rowed as hard as wo could to Lambeth to find Frank's brother. He was at Lambeth in his barge, and he took the bag and opened It in our presence. I think the bag was locked until Frank's brother forced It open. I saw it opened. There was a lot of bones in it, with some clothes, which we took out. All the things were quite emptied out of the bag. Afterwards, when we saw what they were, we put them in again, and gave the bag up to the police. When I found the bag it wanted about six incles of high tide. The bag itself was not at all wet, bat I tbink the things in it were. I did not touch themu. They were not so wet as to drip, but still they appeared to me to be wet. John Hilsby.-I am a bargeman, and live at Richard. street, Cornwall-road, Lambeth. I identify the carpetbag now produced. It was brought to me by the last witness on Friday morning last between 5 and 6 o'olock. He told me he bad found a prize and showed me the bag. I took it out of the boit. It was locked, and we tried a key we had, but it would not fit, and I then forced it open. I found in it a quantity of bones rolled up in the clothes now produced. All the bones were quite rolled up in the clothes, except one large bone, which stuck up in the middle. The clothes were not wet. They might have been damp, but they certainly were not wet. They afterwards got wet by being put into the boat where some water was, bht they were not wet when they were first talken out. I noticed that some of the clothes were much stained uith blood, and I told the last witness to give them up to the police at once. Police-constable C. G. Venn, F 96, said, he was on duty on Friday morn-ng last between 6 and 7 o'clock in the Adelphi-arches, when the two boys, Barber and Hilsby, came to him and asked him to see some things which they had found upon one of the abutments of Waterloo-bridge. Witness went with them to the Fox-under the-Hill, and in the yard of that publichouse he saw a quantity of bones and olothes laid out on the ground. They were the clothes now produced aud the remains which the jury had seen. The clothes were then wet, but not very wet. Witness put them all carefully back into the carpetbag, and took them to the Bow-street police station. When all the clothes and remains were in the bag it weighed about a quarter of a hundredweight. Witness noticed that the clothes were much marked with blood, particularly the shirt and under shirt, which were covered with it. He also noticed that there were cuts or punctures in the clothee. He noticed these more especially on the under and linen shits. Wlitneas took all the things to the station ard gave them to Sergeant Bnck. Police-sergeant Buok, F No. 5, stated that about 8 o'clock on Friday morniug last the two boys Hilsby and Barber, accompanied by the last witness, came to the Bow. street station with the carpetbag produced. Witness then recapitulated the evidenco of the boy as to the manner in which the carpetbag had been found, and also the statements as to its contents. He had particularly examined the cuts or punctures in the clothes. There were three in the back of the coat, two on the shirt as if over the abdomen, and seven through the breast of the shirt and undershirt. The cuts were all very clean and sharp made. After the carpetbag and its contents were lodged at the station witness sent off at once for the divisional surgeon. Mr. R. B. Paynter, surgeon, of 3, Bridge-street, wa5 the next witness examined. He said,-I am divisional surgeon to the F division of police. Oni Friday morning last, at about 9 o'clock, I was sent for to the station at Bow-street. On my arrival there I was shown the carpet. bag produced. It csntained a quantity of bones and clothes -the bones and clothes which the jury have seen. I took all the bones out of the bag, and proceeded to examire them. I fitted them together, and found that they must all have belonged to the same person. They formed a complete skeleton, with the exception of the cervical, seven of the dorsal vertebrac, some portions of the ribs, i with the handi end feet, ard a portion of the lower third of the lesser fibula, or small bone of the leg. All the principal bones were sawn into two or more portions, as d nearly all had pieces of tendon and mnscle attached to them as if the fle-h had been cut off iu a rough, haggling manner. On four places only was the skin left adher7irg to the bones- a piece of considerable size being on the back of each wrist, and on the right tubercle of the left tibia. Those portions of the skin left were partly covered thinly with short blaok hair-, showing that the individual had been a vigorons adult. The flesh adhering to the bones was neither fresh nor decomposed, except in one part, and one part only, where decomposition had commenced in the socket of the left thigh bone. The capsalar ligament of this thigh was cut open, and upon rotating the thigh bone I perceived a strong smell of decomposition, vrith the blue marks produced thereby. The whole of the remaining muscles and bones appeared to be quite undecomposed, and on seeking to discover the cause of this I found in several parts a gritty matter like salt. To the presence of this saline matter I attribute the preservation of the otter portions of the remains. The flesh upon the bones was on the sarface of a reddish brown c..lour, as If from the acton of salt, and of a brighter colour when cut into. I should perhaps bave remarked be. fore that every portion of the internal viscera of the person bad been removed. On examining the ribs I found the second, tbird, and fonrth ribs with a i7ece of the sternum and Hesh adhering. Between the third and fourth ribs was a cut in the flesh of rather smaller size than the cats ir the shirt and under flannel waistcoat. That piece of the ribs when plaoed in its natural position had its stab or hole exactly correspondinginxpositionand direction (its long axis being up and down) with the cuts in the clothes. The reason of the wound in the flesh being smaller is because fles, when wounded, after the weapon is withdrawn contracts again directly. The CoaoNmR.-Can you state positively whether those injuries were inflicted during life ? Sitness-I an. Around the stab a good deal of blood was 6xtravasated into the tissues, showing that the injury must have been inflicted dining the life of the individual. That would not be the case unless the ersion was alve. If acorpsewasstabbedthere might even be a fewv drops of blood, but the blood could not possibly be infiltrated into the tissues, as is the case TnIth these remains. Bound this stab wound I have mentioned the blood is infiltrated into the tissuses, so as to make a mark of some inches in size. The second and third ribs, immediately under that I have mentioned, being missing, accounts for no other marks to correspond with those on the shirt being found. The bones were clean sawn except in one or two places, where great roughness seems to have been used. The saw must have been a fine one, ind from several of the falecutsthat have been nmade on soire of the bones I should inazgine It wtas a narrow one. Several bones of the upper half of the back bone are missing. On examining the remains with regard to ascertainig the sex of tne deceased, I found the bones of such large make that, taki-t that fact in connexion with the portions of skin with shorS dark hair upon it, I should say It was a male. At the sarre time the ptlvis was of larger dimensions than thoie of males generally. I have, hov. ever not the least doubt but that the deceased was a male. Y have measured the principal bones with my own, and think that the deceased man must at the very least have been 5 feet S inches in height. In pursuing my examination of the remains I found some stray hairs ad hering tothe flesh. They appeared to have fallen there. Some that I now produce seem to be hair from the head of a mUan. It is not black, though very dark. There are lso some dark hairs from whiskers. I also found a few hairs which, from theirlengthandfineness, must have been a woman's. 1 have no doubt the dark, short hair belonged to the deceased. I think the body was not cut to pieces until the rigidity oE death had set in some time, because, in ftting together the portions of the right leg, I found the right knee joint and hip joint firnly fixed, so that the thigB must have sbiffened completely at right angles with the rest of the body. The right arm had also stiffened with the forearm under and pointing towards the body. The decomposition I observed in the left hip joint could not ha.ve been produced in less than a week before I saw the remains. The Coroner.-Are you quit2 satisfied that the wound in the ohest you hy.ve described was given durinn life time? Witness-l am certain of it, as the blood had infiltrated the tissues uxtensively ; I should not be surprised from the appearanoR of the remnains, if it was found that they had been o -d, or partially boiled. I imaiOne that that may hane been 'the case from the extraordinary tightnessan rigidity of the tendons. I have not the least doubt that the body was never used for the 'purpose of anatomil, exami- n&'Jon. It is not possiblethat such ould hve been tlhe case. A medical man must have wanted 4. bidy either for the 4Ausglee, oerves, arteries, or bones. The mUr;ltq nerves, siid arteries I ean ont postitively assert have not been diucated, and the bones ae destroyed. - Henry Errington.-I am a toll-keeper at Waterloo. brldge. I vws on duty lat Thursday night at halftput 11 I remember seeing a woman come up from the Strand side. She ras alone-at least I did mot notice any one with her. She had a carpetbag with her. The carpetbag now produced I believe to be the same. She laid a halfpenny on the iron plate, and took the bag. with ner longvays. In tryiig to get it through with her she turned the stile twice. I said to her, " Why don't you ask people to lift up your bag for you? See what you have done; you have made me lose a halfpenny." She said something in reply in a gruff tone of volce, and I stooped down and took the bag by the handles and put my hand under the bottom and so lifted it up on to the iron plate of the stile. I am certain from that that it had leathern handles with leathern bottom and sides. I particulArly noticed the bag, as there was a strong light from the gaslamp, and on the side I noticed there was a bright flower in the pattern. On the ba now produced is a flower which I believe to be the same that I noticed. Iam not certain thbt I should know the woman again, but I think I should if I saw her. Her hair looked as if it had been powdered and plastered thickly down on to her forehead. I particulaaly remarked that she seemed agitated, and as if she was in a hurry, and I thought she was hurrying to go by the train from Waterloo, which starts at 11.45. She spoke rather uff; it was certainly in a masculine tone of voice. Her neight maight have been about 5 feet 3 inches. She was a shortwoman and rather stoutish. I have no recollection of seelng her come off the buidge again. The Coroner then addressing the jury said, he did not propose to trouble them with further evidence that day. The matter was now in the hands of the police, and they could not do better than not interfere 'with them. He pro. posed to adjourn the inquiry for a fortnight, by which time he trusted that there would be some additional edidence to lay before them. The inquiry was then formally adjourned to 3 o'clock on Mondlay, the 20th inst. U p to last night the police, under the directions of Mr. Superintendent Durkin, were still engaged in active seuach for any clue which could lead to the detection of some one of the persons (for there is now no doubt that there were several) who have been concerned in this horrid murder. As yet, however, we regret to say that not the slightest trace has been obtained. Tho witne&s Rfilby yesterday brought to the station the miDsng sock and part of the neckhandkerchief ofthe deceased, which were overlooked when the eontents of the bag were first emptied out into the barge, but which on afterwards searching to see if any articles had been forgotten he found. The sock is, of course, the fellow to that in the bag, and both, there Is not the slightest doubt, are of German manufacture. They are cotton-nbbed in a very peculiar manner, and such, it is stated, as are only made in Germany. This quite bears out the opinion expressed by tailors who have seen the clothes of the deceased, that at least the greater pa were made abroad. Of course, with a foreigner who may have had but few friends in London, or posibly was only here on a short visit, this still further diminishes the chance of his clothes being recognized. The half of the necktie which has been found in the bare isa black silk one, with a small ptterned blue silk end. As with the other portions of the it has been cut in half at the back, and only one-half appears to have been put into the carpetba. From the make of the deceased's shfirt it is evident that he must have worn his shirt collar turned down over the nocktie, which again confirms the suspicion that he was not a native of this country.
REGISTRAT1ON& CITY OF LONTnN Mlr. T. Y. MCCnnRIsTT, the Revising Barrister, continued the revision of the list of electors for the city of London yesterday in the Court of Common Pleas, Guildhall. Mr. S. Smith and Mr. Ledger attended, as usual, to support the Liberal interest. The lists of a great number of parishes were disposed of witnout the ocourrence of any circumstance worthy of motice. In the list for the parish of St. Thomas-the-Apostle ap. peared the name of Mlr. Henry Suter, whose qualfication was described as a ' gateway to stables." The REVISING BARP.nisTER said he did not think he could hold the qualif cation as described to be a good one with. out giving to Mfr. Perkins, whose claim he had rejected (as noticed in The Times of Saturday), a very good ground of complaint. Mr. SZIITII thought the qualifica'don was intended to rest upoa the stables, which were occupied by the person whose name appeared upon the list. If the gateway alone Ws relied u,can, he adm-itted the qualification was insufficient. The lea-aed BARRISTER considered he was bound to deal with the qualification as decribed by the person who claimed the benefit of it, and was clearly of opinion that a gateway was not a sufficient qualification to entitle a person to be placed upon the register of voters. The name was thereupon expunged from the list. IN THE PJIRISH OF ST. MARY ABCHURCEI. Mr. H. M. East and Mr. W. Hooton, both of Cannonstreet, claimed to be plnced upon the reister in resnect of premises occupied by them. Mr-. LEDGER, in support of the claims, proved that there had been sufficient occupation, and also that in each case there had been a claim to be rated for the relief of the poor, In order to enable the present claims to be substantiated. Mr. East stated that he had resided in another portion of the city previously, and had been put upon the register of voters, but bad not paid any poor-rate, and neither had he done so at his present residence. Mr. LEDGER prcduoed a copI Qf t-he npjice served upon the cverseeis on behilf of hbi.asti CiUIng fo be rated. The Vestry-Clerk produced the ratebook, showing that a rate was made in June, 1I6, to which Mr. East had not been assessed, his occupancy of the premises in Cannonstreet only commnencing at Christmas last. He, however, believed that another rate had been made since that time. After some further search, however, it was found that no subsequent rate had been made. Mr. S. SNITH1 submitted th.t the claim made by Mr. East to be rated was sufficient, and the rate of June, 186, did not aDply to him. The R671n3UsG B.ArpRISTER saed the date of the allowance of the rate. Mr. LEDGFut said the ratebook did not show the date of - the allowance of the rate, altho3gh there wve an entry that Aldermsu Cubitt had allowed it. That defect would be a difficulty in the way of proving the legality of the rate, but he su'fluitted that, as none had been made dvibng the last electoral year to which Mr. Easi's claim referred, that gentleman's right to be placed upon the register could not he defited. The RE.VISING BARRISTER, after ascertaining that there had betn no rate made this year, and that there were no arrears due in respect o, the premises, admitted the claim of Yr. East, as also that cf Mr. Hooton, which was based upon a simuilar state of facts. Mr. LEDGER observed that, in consequence of a change of officers, this list was vesy inaccurate, conprising many persons without Chritian names, others without addresses, and even women. Several corrections having been made, one name was objected to by hIr. Ledger, wno stated that the person upon the list was a womrn, and therefore must be expunged. The 10EvISiNG BABisTERn, findiag no one appeared to rebuit tho obje.ction, erased the name from the list. The remainder of the day was occupied in business of a formal character. MARYLEBONE. MTr. M'Queen, the barrister appointed to revise the lists of electors for the borough of Marylebone, held a court yesterday at the Co-art-house, Marylebone-lane, for the purpose of settling the lists of that particular parish. The liats of the parish of Paddington were disposed of on Saturday by the learned gentleman. The RErISIinG BA}RISTER, at the opening of the proceedings, asked whether the parish authorities could justify the division of the borough into districts, with separate lists, when the Aot of Parliament required him to revise the list of electors. He did not know of any objection to such a course being taken in St. Marylebone, but he was told that In a neighbouring borough the point would be raised. The Vestry - Clerk said the divisioa had been made in this borough for many years, and probably the separate lists which had been prepared in the parish of Islington, to which the learned gentleman had alluded, had been a consequence of a division of the parish into districts under the Metronolis Loc:-l Ianagement Act. 'he only polnt worthy of notice which arose was an objection taken by one T. Peters to the name of Catharine Currey, which appeared upon the regiSter of electors. The objector did not appear to prove his notice of objection, neither did the person objected to appear to seek the retention of the name. The REVISING BARRISTEm said, as the notice of objection was not proved, he could not expunge the name of the person objected to. The Rate Collector said he could testify to the fact that the pierson objeeted to was a woman, as, Indeed, tlie name The RrvisiN-G BARRISTER said he had no official evidence of that-fact. Many males bore female Christian nam es and vice versa, and in the absence of further proof he coutd not expunge the name. A t the same time no harm would be done, as if the person who was objected to appeared at the poll booth in female attlre to vote at an election the poll clerk wroutld, of course, refuse her vote. The other proceedings were quite destitute of interest for the general public.
THE CAPn MATT,S.-SO S MIPTO N' Oct. 12.- The Union IScrew Company's steanship Celt. Captain Bro7wn, left to-day, vitheight pae. eager and 1050COh ih spfoie, for the Cape of Good Hope, calling at Ply outh to embark the mails. She is co31ed for tie entire voyage oat It is reportcd that the contract for these rnilS was orii nally taken for carrying them frem 9tampson to t Capo, but that subsequently an arramgement has'been made for the ships to call at Plymouth mr the mails, the company receiving 1001. a-month exta Fan this additiceal t-oublo. This is an abmurdity on the part of Government vhich can - can never be persisted in, 'we should think, when tl'e facts become known. A verssl loading at London would, of cours, cZll at a nort in the Channel for the mails; but that a vessel leaving SouthamDton should go into Plymout'h for the mails is so palpably ridiculous tht it can never be tolerated. Such an arrangement can only be imagined as a sopB thrown to the constituency of Plymouth by its officiaW .epresentative ; but it is too bad to perpetrate so gross au absurdity as this, and mal;e the public funds pay for it to the extent of 1,2001. a-year. Besides which, the shipping of the mails at Plymouth occasions an Increase of railway mileage to the extent of the difference between 80 miles to Southampton and 250 to Plymouth from th-j metropolis, Without alluding to other objections, those stated are suficient to lead to the reversal of such a decision and a retn to the oziginal inten. tion of embarking the mails at Southamnpton, from which part the company fiad it to be their interest to despatch their vessels.

YNDIAN MUtTIIES.-THE K-LIP FUND. - -- BT. XARYLEnOX7 -a Pubwic meeting of the pariah -of ,1 Nfasyleboix was held yesterday at the Courthouse. Marylebone-lano, in sapport of tho fund for the relief of tho sufferers by the Indi.au mutiny; the ReY. M.r. Eyre, Rector of St. Mary. Lebone, In the chair. The Rev., CImurmAxr opened the proceedings by ohserIng that it wia an unfozt inate time to call such a meeting, when all tho leading inhabitants in point of rank and wealth 'were absent from town, anid some persons were of opinion that it would ha%ve been better to open at sabscription instead of calliig a meeting; but he was not of that opInin for he was pesaded that on such an occasionthne' inhabitantsofhe great parish of Miarylebone would not ha-ve beon satisfied by merely tbrowping their- cold guineas into the general fundj without having an opportunity of expressing their syinpa.~ tbies for their fellow countrymen and countrywomen who hatd been sufferers from the unparalleled outrages that had bten perpetrated in India, and of declaring their concurrence in the national will to ptut down the abominable insurrection tha,r,t had Inflicted such unheard-of misery on t-heir elo,w creaturs. (Cheers) This wras not the occasion on which to, enter on, an inquiry into the causes of the insurrection. It was enough for them to stand boldly forward and avow their determiinationL at any sacrifice to support the Government, of wphatever political elements it might be composed, in putting down the insurretionin maintaininig the majesty of England's flag, and in aiding to avenge the cruelties that had been perpe. trated on English subjects. Let it not, however, be supposed that he was one to join in the call for vengeance, if, indieed, any such call had ever been made, but which he had never heard. On thq contrary, he had nevcr seen a single Asiatic subject to the slightes insult even byv the boys in the streets (cheers), although.'he mutst own that, when. ever he passada swarthy countenance his heart rose withinhim as hethought of the outraged mother and the nmurdered baba. (Hear, hear.) Bet, though he called not for vengeance., yet he was readyto mnaintain that for the preservation of ott countrymen in the East, and for the maintenanceo of socia order slnd law amid the family of mnanktindfor theo instincts of humanity could not be so fiendishly out. raged witliout calling out for a just visitation of human resentment and, he would add, the retribuLtion of a God Of all justice-it did beliove' them to inflict a memorable example on the perpetrators of these crimes. (heers.) With regard to the ftture good of India he believed it was one of hope. Of the issue of the stru~ggle there could be no donbt,first, becuse hie had confidence in the blessings of an all-just Godi sec-ondly, becausevwhatever might have been the failings of En3gland or her Government, s'he had inflicted o'n offence upon India which justified such outrageous criree - and, thirdly, because he well knew what were the impulses of Englisa blood and the energies of England's sons. (Cheers.) He doubted not the issue, and that her provinces woulId be reclaimed, though he believed that England herseolf needled such anx ordeal. It was requisite that she should be called upon to stand alone and show her innate power and strengt h. Of this too he was convinced, that for the future the secrets of the Indian Government would nio longer lie hid inx the buireau of the Board of Control or in the archives of the East India Company, but that the whole managemient of that empire would comne under the inquisitive eye of the British public. ((Teers.) A great task was now assigned to them, and whic it would require mnuch patience, forbes.ranco, and taut to perform, for the problem they had to solve was, how far a C ristiate Government could maintain itsChristiau integrity in administering rule over a heathen population. (Hear, hear.) The rev. gentleman then statedl that he had received a letter from Cai dinal Wiseman, who said that, but for the fact of his havin retired to the coast by the advice of his medical attendanut, he would have been present at the meeting, and his Eminenee enclosed a subscription of 101. The Secretary read letters from the Duke of Portland (with a second'subscriptlon of 1001.), Lord Manvers, Lord Portman, and others expressing their regret at not being able to attend. Sir B. HALL, In moving the first reslution, expressed his entire concurrence in the view taken by the rev, chairman as to the piropriety of holding a publio meeting on the subject under consideration, because whatever might be the amount of subscription that might be collected by calling on the inhabitants from house to house, he thought, in ref erence to a subject of this great magnitude, it should be m-ade mansifest to the public that they, felt the same inte-se interest in it as hbad been shown in every other pori-Fon of the khngdom, and were as ready to aid in carrying out the object they haLd in view. So convinced was he himself that that was the right course to purs'.e that he had purposely come fromi Wales to be presenit that day. He agreed with their rev. chairman that this was not the time to enter into any political questions as to what midght be t-he cause of the mutiny in India, and what circumstances had led to the disastrous results they must all deplore. It would ill become hira then to inquire into matters which must in the course of a few months undGrgo a full sarutiny and criticism, when answers would be given to those wrho wrould have the firal decision of the question. Confuinng himself, therefore, to the object they' had in view, he might truly say, that if a real and sincere sympathy on the part of their fellow-countrymen could give any satisfaction or cnnsolation to those who hadl suffered. such horrible cruelties, or to their bereaved relatives, they must have received it to the f ullert and most entire extent, because the same feeling -which the present meeting expresed extended from one endl of the kin-doin to the other.xThi he might say, as regarded the politica part of the question, that it was gratifying to find that the dissatisfaction which existed in our Eastern empire was confined to one class of the community only, and thait as regarded the great portion of thae population they seemnedl to he satisfied with. British rule and.dominion. (Hear, hear.) The fetling of dissatiisfaction was confined solely to the army. That was somne comfort, and also strong evidenk* in favour of the manner in which tbis country had governed that great empire. This fact also ought to be borne in mnind, that while they had heard with horror of the dreadful tragedies -which had taken place under the direct control and sanctIon of one of the great Rajahs of the country, yet there were other Rajahs well disposed towards England's rule, and whose names would be made k-nown hereafter in order that due honour might be rendered to them. It ought not therefore to go forth that all the native Princes and Governments were against us, Many, much to their own detriment, and even to their own danger,had held themselves aloof from those who had raised this mutiny and who had sympathized with us and giren us assistance in this our hour of distress. (Cheers.) It - must be highly satisfactory to every one to know that the news which had been just received was of a more cheerful character than any that had yet reahed us. Findinog their cause desperate the mutineers in Delhi had marched out and made a second assult-the strongest they had ever made--in order to prevent our siege guns being brought up against Delhi, the wralls of which by this time had no doubt been succesfully breached; and General Nlobolson was able to repulse them, taking their guns and planting his siege guns against that fated city. (Cheers.) It was impossible to read of the elailnt deeds of such ment as Nicholson and of Havelock without a feeling of grateful admiration for sucoh men-men who were gaining victories every day, the last victory bein- more important than any other. (Cheers.) While the cau.se of England in India was entrusted to such commanders they mnight feel quite assured that the British armns would be well supported, and that the like success would crown their efforts wh ich had almost ever resuilted from British actions. (Cheers.) The right hon. baronet then moved the following resolution: " Tha we, tbe tababttantsaot the paiah of St. Marylebore, in pubUc meeting assrmbled, desIre to express profound s)nip%thy with our fellow-country.nen In India In the severe trials end privations to whalh they and those dependent upon themi have been reduced by the mutiny of the native troops inL that country." Mr. R. E. BitouGnTo.N seconded the resolution. The R1ev. Canon O`NEAL, having been caled upon by the chairman, said he fealt somewhat emnbarrassed in addressing the meeting upon a subject which had been already so eloquently treated. He believed this was the first time in thelhistory of nations when almost a whole army had risen up in mautiny against the odiceors who had been accustomed to lead them to triumphant victories, and out them down aud destroyed them aLa most base and perfidious manner, without their receivinga imoment's notice. BuLt these inhumnan executioners did not confine themselves to the destruction of their military leaders, but wreaked their vengeance in the maust barbarous mnanner even on helples ladies and innocent children, destroying all without nmery in a mauner more cruel than could be conceived by the imagination of man. After making a strong appeal to the meeting ont bthslf of the object for which they were specially convened, the rev, gentleman proceeded to observe that any one who at-tempted to throw the apple of discord or of divison among any body of menL who were combined to aid so noble a c'use of charity would be guilty of an act of inijustice and of cruelty. An unjust and ungenerous interpretation had been given to the pastoral of his Eminence Cardinial Wise. man by one of the leading journals of the day. In that pastoral his Eminence advocated the necessity of tenderingl assista.nceto thedistressed inlndia. II was addressed,toal the congregations in his diocess, and was intended to meet three general objects. One was to provide an outfit for 12 priests, who were invite by the Government to be sent out, to assist in administering to the spiritual wantis of the soldiers in the East. The second object was to alleviate the miisery and wretchedness of the nuns in the East, whose oon-' vents had been burnt and whose property had been destroyed ; and' the third object was to conatribute to the gzeneral fund now bei-grs - owihsanin tes A. Genteman in the body of the meeting here rose to order, and slid, lie had not come there expecting t-o hear a' defence of Cardinal Wiseman, (Hear, hear.) The Rev. Canon O'SFEL.-I am not making a defence. I am endeavouring to explain the positioa of the Catholics in this einjire. The Ce= ,i.-Go on. The Rev. Canon O'NIAL.-My object is not to supuress the feelings or oppose the irtentlo&s of tle Catholics of this empire m regard to this great wock of charity, but, as our ehairman has told us that ths ba3t means of removing abuses is to publish them and i-site public opinion to them, I am anxious to act upon that principle; and in doing so I think it would' have a most etftacSous tendency to carry out the charitable object of thi Meeting. Well, the object of the!pastoral was to provide an outfit for the 12 priests invited by the War.offloe, It is to be understooa that although the GovernmeAki allowed eael priest 100 rupees a month, or 1201 a year soeprovisLoi was made for an outfit, which would come k>about 5W. or 601. more for each pnrest. This would creave a. want of at least 5001. or 6001. It was to provide this money that the; pastoral was issued. Since then Archbishop WI len has also published a pastoral, whichb has been severely csuremd in the public newspapers, (Cries of " Queskiosi I") The CHAI,Muia iquite sympatbized with the rev. gentleman while he conaied his remarks to the case of Cardinal Wisamasi, but 1' e ought not to travel beyond what had iefesence talthat -.ev. person. Tho Ret, Canon O'WNRAL then proceeded to complhin of the very ',artial manner in which tho Crimean Patrio'1 Fund h'd been applad, but was calld to order by The COrAusix, who requested that the rev. g,.atemau Nomlqd not nmake any. allusion to bygones. The 3eAv. Ciqen 6NExA. said, it was noi, al bgone; but 'wbat he required -was that the meetig Wpuld pled2e jelf toA faiWr and iimpatia OAA* 2 g tho tmld t was now beingraised. The Catholicg throug%out the country were under an Impreagion-that justicZ hadz ot ~bei done-in r to the distribution ofth; ,tijc ,Fund-, . hef CHAuAN, was sure .he should be expreu1ng the "eleng of tho meeting when be utteted hix firm con V1Oti&n I thatit waa the desire of all parties that the natio's mad 'homld be adimiistered nc.atdlie to tbe sitles of ,the caso, and noVamording t'tloe creed or Christian deaomiaItien of the individual. (Cheerg., The resolutiom was then agreed to. Lord EBRIxGTOz mored the following resolation "Tbat for the pnrpwof gf3 4aeticsiect to the ybrof Ihis meeting &public enScopMon be fOdthi,b alsed i hisPatstoh,f and thathe folowing gentlensus o a eSttee to Peaeive and o esr Of t rareruns:- n elg r4e for Lhe reMot His Lordship would nOt alticipa'e the investigations atd ousasslons to which this subjbot must be submitted, but he might be perunftted to &y tha4 at one time it was the fashion to hold the East InAig Gonp uy up in advantageous contrast to our Colonial and Ioone aduinistration, while recently they had heard every proceeding of that Company Impugned, and the Company i?elfheld responsible for the terrible calatities that had occnured. Now, v'hile on the one hand he vrould be the last person to declare the Company free of its fuU measure of he4nan impeareotion, yet on the other htnd the adherence to our interests of so mkny native princes, under very trying circumstances, and of so lare a proportion of the population, ought to console us wish the zefleetion that at all events Brtisla rule had not been on the whEole so disastrous so dipcredstable, or so odious as it had somotimes been reprosented. (Cheers.) The noble lord deprecated anything like indiscriminate vengeance being visited on the natives of Yndia. He was not one wrho sbared in the feeling of horror at capital punishments, but, surely, between such a feeling and asn indiscriminate shout for vengeance there was sousa mLiddle course. It was due to their dignity as a civilized coantry, to their hanour as a strong and powerful country, and, above all, to their character as a Christian country, that, if they punished, It should ba done in the spirit of jnstice-sEtern and unbend.ng,if they would,-but still in an inquiringand an impartia spit of jstice, and not in a spirit of wild andindiscriminate vengeance. (Rear, hear.) Professor MARKs seconded the resolution. and,in reference to 'what had fallen from the Rev. Canon O'Neal in regard to the distribution of the Patriotic Fund said, that according to ore of the rulesof the comnuitteethe fand ase admninistered, -without distinction of religion or nationality, to every perEon who 'had a claim upon the sym pathy and assistance of the British people. Tae Rev. EARDLLY WTLhSOT supported tbe resolution. The Rlev. Canon O'NEAL said, no doubt the raues drawn up in reference to the application of the Patriotic Fund were most excellent, but when it was remembered that that furd amounted to ,l0,OOOOi., and that nearly half the soldiers in the Crimea were Catholic-, and that there were not mnore than 10 orphans of Oatholic parents in the schools founded in Ireland by the comrnittee of that fsnd, while there were between 600 and 700 orphan children of other relig-ons professions educated in tho3s schools, it was lisyossible to remove the impression from the mirde of tho Catholics that the fund had not been impartially admsnistered. The resolution w as then agreed to. On the motion of Sir EASoTorE, seconded by Mr. PoFE, it was resolved,- rhatt Sir Soa nel sc tt and Company he requ;Sstd to act a^s tes. eurer. end Mr. W. A. Greenwel. bse vestry eerk, as hon. secretarv to the coDsemlttee." The list of subscriptions was then read, and which, including the collection of the various churches on the Day of Humilitation, amounted to upwards of 2.3001. A. vote of thanks to the chairman terminated the proceedings. -T - C'HATEHAM. A nreating of the Jewish inhabitants of the borough of Cbatham took place on Sunday evening, for the purpose of taking into con-ideration a letter receivess from the Chief Rabbi relat ive to the fund nowv beirg raised for the relief of the sufferers by the Indian mutinits. The chair was taken by Mr. J. M. Mark, deputy of the Jews, and Higb C,onstable of lChathain. ahe CRAN expressed the gratification he experienced in taking part in tho movement which had been originated by his co-re!igionists, and trusted that the example set by the Jewvs of Chatham 'would be followed in other towns. Mr. B. ALEXANDB moved, and Mr. D. Bx1N;ARD seconded, "Pot this mettr g. deeply sympathlzmsg sih oar fellow-country. men for the rebef of the 8i fferers by the mutlns In India, do reM6:ve that the sum ot £27 be given from tbe funsu of theo Chatham Hebrew Congrwation E nd. lncependeotly of the itdivifMal nbEcriptions of the Jewlah rmembera.

Most of the Jewish inhabitants of Chatamn have subscribed le.rgely to the ftnd now being raised iu that town. REDRUTH. An influential meeting to consider the necessity of taking steps to rclieve our suffering fellow-subjects in India was held in the town-hall, Redrutb, on Saturday. Among those present were both the members for WestCornwall and several of the neighbouring clergy and gentry. The chair wps taken by Mr. MICHIATL WIeLLIis, AL P., who, in opening the meeting, said he felt quite sure there was no necessity for him to recapitulate the horrible detals of murders and atrocities which had been oerpetrated by the Indian mutineers; they were without a parallel in the world's history, and lhe was convinced the syunpathies of all were awakened, and 4hat no special appeal was needed to Induce' all present to come forward to the relief of the sufferers. Mr. RICHIARD DAVZY, M.P., moved the first resolation, and expressed strong syrmpathy with ouzr sr`cring fellow counsrymen and countrywomen in India and their afflicted relatives, and reminded the naeeting of the efforts this district had so success fully made upon a somewhat similar occasion when they were asked to support the Patriotic Fund. Several other gentlemen also addressed the meeting, and strongly autmadverted on the policy of our Indian Government, upon which theCnAntaxAy observed that, although he believed the Indian and Home Governments had both much to answer for, yet, until all bhe facts were fairly brought before Parliament, which they would be in the ensuing session (when every muember would have a most onerous duty to perform), it was hardly right to condemn any one. A very handsome sum was subscribed in the room. YEOVIL. A subscription has been commenced In this town and neighbourhood, which has already produced above 4001. Tl-e Mayor, Mr. W. Bide, urder whose auspices the movement was begun, wUIl complete the collection as soon as possible and transmit the amount to tbe Lord Mayor.
PRWVCIES'S HEEATRE. Last night this house wzu reopened for the season, bright with the new decorations which we recently described. Panels, ceiling, and proscenium all shone with a light sort of gaiety, most agreeably substituted for the hot, beavy style of adornment by which the theatre has so long been characterized. But the especial " sight" of the evening was the new drop-curtain by Messrs. Grieve and T-lbin, which is a masterpiece of its kind. The chief object presented to the audience in this p;inting is a large figure of Shakspeare on a pedestal, supposei. to be discovered by the withdrawal of two side curtains, dcoorated with medallions in which are depicted the tragic and comic muses. The play was the Tcmpcst, performed with all those " effects" which rendered it the wonder of last season, and which are now attained with a degree of Iglibness that was impossible in the earlier days of its representation. Mr. Kean was heartily welcomed when he descended from the rock on which he is discovered as Prospero, and after the fall of the new drop-*crtain, which was not exhibited till the end of the first act, he was summoned so long, as the originator of all the new beox.ties of the establishment, that, after a modest resistance, he at last showed himself in compliance with the universal voice. At the conclusion of the play there was another call, which Mr. Kean answered, in the first instance, alone, An. then reappeared leading.Mlis Kate Terry, the sparkling representative of ArieL

Its native officers were originally all taken from the Line rrgiments of the Bengal army, abd n ost of the men have relations among the Sepovs of the LiLe. The Legion ba rather above theauslm propiortion of Brahmins, aid about the average number of Rajpoots and the other mill tary classes, and Lo low-caste men. " There are also in the Legion three companies of Bheels and Meenas from the hills and juDgles of Ranpootaia. 'I hbEe tribes are totally without caste, nd ignorant of aliost any religion whatever. They wiU eat the tlesh of the cow , Big, or anything else that falls in their way. They are a smnart race, particularly the Neems. All these men-that is, the eight companies of bighcaste Bengal Sepoys and the three compbnie8 of Bbeels and Meenas-work together in all duties, either in cantonmeuts or on command, and shoulder to shoulder ia the same companies on parade, as if there were no such thing as caste in exitence. Thishas been the case for some 16 years, ever snce the Bheel and Meena companies were embodied. 'About four years ago the European offioers of the Legion laid out a garden for the men. The whole of the work sras CSone by the Sepoys (all- castes indiscriminately), uho handled the shovel and pickaxe, sunk a large well, the shaft of which is some 26 feet square by 70 or 80 deep, and two Persian wheels may be worked at it. They dug, manured, planted, and did al that was requisite. The same men still continue to do aU tho labour in the garden. There are several mud wralls In the can tonments bulilt by the Sepovs. '"There arc three troops of irregular cavalry in the Legion, nearly all Muesulmaiw. UJp to the last advices the v;holeb continued to do all duties as if there were no matiny in the Bennl army. "Spt. 2;,; After the perusal of the above memorandum It wil very naturally be asked what more could be desired or expected from native soldiers, and whit possible cause or causes can there be to drive such men into mutiny-into the vengeful massacre of their European officers-into an utter reoklessness with respect to their immediate and future personal in terests, involving the loss of employment and the loss of provision In old age, of their liberal pensions from Government- and into exposing themselves to the risk of a direful ietributive vengeance. There must, tben, be somue fatal, itmperative, and irresistible obligation to produce such resultv. Sir, any one but a sciolist in the knowledge of Asiatic beliefs, customs, and usages replies that external bodily defilemenb is removed by ablutions and oblations, but that a breach of certain alimentary laws ipso fao consigns the offender r to excom. munication and degradation, than which death is preferable, for his parents, his brothers, and his fiiends can neither eat nor smoke with him, nor let him drink out-of their water vessels. He is become an out-caste. le is condemrned to contempt in this world, and his soul is damned in the next. Now, it is very lamentable that in this age of reason such stern obligations should be accepted by human beings and he operative; but they exist,-there they are:as great facts. So it is lauentable that hostile religions ehoigld exist; but thEre they axe, aud alwysyahave beer.-great facts which prgduced the conflicts of the Houmoousians and the Homolousans in our early ohurch, Baztholomew's Eve, p)a Montford's bloody doings at Carcassone, Anabaptist atro. dities at Munster, our Smithfield fires, Irish massacres, and tven in these daas tbreatened bloodshed at Belfast. Nor are alimentary laws of modern origin. We find that the Egyptians could notteat with the asonsof Jacob becauie " that was an abomination to the Egyptians J) the Jews equally were debarred by their usages from eating with the Gentiles, as is attested by St. Peter's vision of the sheet full of animals and the command, " Rise, ldll and eat," and St. Peter's reply of " Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean." Acts x, 11-15, a nd at verse 28 St. Peter adds, " Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation." With such precedents in our own Sacred Volume we can the more readily understand the food obligations of the Hindoos, which, however, have, no doubt, increased in stringency with the growth of Brahminical influence since the Christian era. But whether more or less stringent, if we take the Hindoos as our servants, subject to their religious obligations, as just and humans masters we ate bound to respect those obligations. The Mahomedans, also, are equally Esubjiect to a food interdict, in the case of swine's flesh; and Brigadier John Jacob knows fall well that if he were to order his Mahomedan soldiery (though they may venerate him} to bite a cartridge greased with pig's fat, or his high-caste troopers to bite a cartridge greased wvith cow's fat, that both the one and the other would promptly refuse obedience, and, in case he endeavoured to enforce it, they would shoot him down.t Let us suppose such an order to have beern given. at Meerut, or anywhere else, to native troops, and the consequences were inevitable. Missionary labours would have bad nothing to do with producing the bloody results; though Christianity itself had not existed they wos4d have followed, and a Buddhist, a Pagan, or any other authority vwould equally have been resisted to the death. Irrational and absurd as these caste obliga. tions are, oven felons in the gaols die to maintala them and their active resistance to the recently introducedmnessing system in the gaols of Bengal and the North-West Provinces has occasioned bloodshed. WVe have read in a recent Madras newspaper that rome convicts who were embarked for transportation to the eastward refused the ship's food given to them, and, as they were dying of starva. tion, it mecame necessary to disembark .thenm. How are we to deal with such tenaoious obduracy? We cannot kill the fanatics, and we can ouly, therefore, lamenb the fa.a. ticsm and tolerate it. It is little known or thought of in the western world to what privations and sufferings. the high-caste Sepoy u subjected in embarking for foreign service. From the moment he sets foot on board a ship.he connot cook; he cannot receive the ship's provisions, and sis suppoTt is confined to parched graia and condiments whickhe takes with hiu. In the great expeditions to Java, China, aLd the Persian Gulf these privations and sufferings were borne cheerfully by thousands of Sepous.in our service, and would be borne again and again if their religions prejudices were respected. In the present feeling of resentmnent whicbh has been so jusUy roused by the bloody acts-. of the Bengal, Sepoys, and the generally-expresee&, want of confidence. in. tne ruture loyalty of the Brahnin. and RajRoct, it is of vital importance, as we cann* t do withoub a nativa. army, that there 'shouid be a clear underzasiding, not. only with respect to the constittion of that army, but, that in its nianement we should have tonstantly in, lindt what services we can and what.woe eannat ex*ct from thlem In our dread of Brabniins an* Eajpoowo miu be carOfu2l that -we do not go to the cSler ext3emo, and plaRe pun, selves at the mercy of Ptjabee 'ussulmaps, 'or Sibs, the latter having prejuadceS vdhoit ao-slaying as strour!, or even stronger, than tb4A,e of the.

FOREIGNh IN T:23ETLLI TCE, FIANCE. (nmo 0 OWN CORLOSNDEn.) rA portion of tX folloUwng appeared La otr ind ' iU Of Yest : d-a] PARIS, OcT. 11, 6 P.M. A report Is still current of a contemplated meeting between the French and Ausian Enmperors, to take place, it Is said at Munich; and, without rffinmtg it to be well founded, 1 may observe that it obai some credit with perons who do not lightly confide in such rumours. lf the interview eoes oWccr It may be oonidered to complete the harmonlous concert among the great continentalPowers. The Mon,itez de 14 Ilotte to-day repeats that the Emperor (who arrived last night at St. Cloud) will vist Marilles before the end of this month. A telegraphic despatch announees that Prince Gortchalroftlhas addressed a confidential circular, relating to the Stuttgart interview, to the Russian Minister at foreign Courts. It is said tobe extremely pacific, and to recommend the maintenance of existing treaties. A trial of some interest has eommenced before the Tribunal of Correctional Police at Colmar (UJpper hine). Count Migeon, who was a member or the LeeItiative Asembly of 1849, and who was elected Deputy to the Legisative Body in 1852, aain presented himself to the electors this year, and was returned by 17,000 voices, against 10,000 obtained by the Government candidate. He is now indicted for fraudulent practices at the elections. The charges against him are stated under nine different heads, ineluding the rather strange accusation against a man of his respectability and position, of hav worn the rlband of the Legion of Honour and some foreign decorations wIthout being entitled to them. A .Louis Hlirabert, superintendent of military edificess, is accued with him. The celebrated Republican advocate, Jules Fare~, defends M4. Mgeon. The trial is likely to last a week. 14. Migeon and his friends are confidenlt that the charges brought against him will not only be triumphantly refuted, but that lllegal manceuvres on the part of the Government candidate will be proved. According t,o the present French Constitution, the Corps Legislatif must meet within six months of a dissolution. It is therefore expeted that that Assembly will shortly be convoked since the sx uonths expire on the 29th of November. Despatches from Athens state that Admiral Clavaud, the new Commander-In-Chief of the Freneh Levant squadron, had a private audience of the King of Greece on the 27th September, and was most graciously received. The nomination of General Kalergi as Minister to the Court of the Tuilerles has not yet taken place. His friends attribute the delay to hostile intrigues both in Paris and in London, bat express a sanguine expectation that these will soon be overoome, and that the General will be sent to his new post. Official despatches received at the Ministry of Marine from Senegal, under date of the 15th ult., say that during the entire month of August] the expeditionary column commanded by the Governor, M. Faidherbe, had had constant engagements, invariably seccessful, with the bands of Al-Hadji, the Arab chieftain. It is said to be intended to appoint a maritime prefect at Algers, which will be the chief city of the sixth maritime arrondissement of France. There seems to be no doubt that the sentence of death passed upon Captain Doineau, as instigator of the murder near Tlemcen, will be commuted to banishment to a French penal settlement. The Bevue des De=x Afondes in its last number has an article on " the events In India," interestlug as a whole, and containing some passages worthy of particular notice. The following appreciation of the conduct of the English in their Eastern possesaions, and of the benefits their goverment has conferred upon the country, may be considered with profit by those French journalists who daily insist that the origin of the revolt is to be sought in the oppressive and cruel nature of British rule. The Retue says:- "The English have been in reality the liberatomrsof the Indians; they have abolished In India the reign of brlgands and substituted foe It justice and law ; they there perform the part of grand justliaries. For a long series of centurles the history of India was bit a series of massres and exter minatioen It was the English conquest that closed this era of blood, and, without wishing to represent the English Government as the model of all virtues, it may be said to have been the most humane, gentle, and just the Indisa have ever known. The English have fertlzed India; they have made roads and railways; they have established erder there Thehi greatest error has been to have too soon believed that theyhad cted a nation. They have given to the natives liberties they were not able to support, and the triumph of barbrism has ensued." I'he writer of the article declares that if England lost India it would be a much greater misfortune for the Indiana than for the English, and a calamity for the human race. He protests against the cry raised against missionaries and Bible Societies, and upholds proselytism by persuasion, while admitting that an attempt to impose Christianity on the Indiana is not to be thought of. The question cannot be argued in this place; but, since various French periodicals besides the Revue have blamed England, some of them in bitter and violent terms, for not having attended to the converion of her Indian subjects, I may be allowed to remark that in Algeria the strictest orders are given not to meddle in any way with the religion of the Arabs. Why do not some of the journals that so severely censure our supineness, and that show such anxiety for the salvation of the Asiatic Hindoo, lift up their voices in behalf of that of the African Mussulman? The Revue proceeds to proclaim that the dominant sentiment excited out of England by the Indian insurrection is tbat of ill-disguised satisfaetion:_ " Poplar opinion pays a necessary debt to humanity and to the commonest propriety by reproving the excesses of the insurgents; but, that official duty once fulf lled, it does not diauJse Its content. Let the English nation be well assured that it is not loved in the world; it is too selfish for its nms fortunes to be looked upon by other nations as family misfortunes, and it has been too fortunate not to have provoked mmeOnse envy. Distinctions are to be made among those who rejoice at pressnt events. The CathoLic party in Frnce and on the whole continent see the chastisement of heresy in the blow that strikes England, and applauds, as lemons of Providence, the calamities that faill on the enemiw of the Church. Whatever may be thought of this sentiment, oue may at least pronounce It not a mAean one; but there is another, mnuh more widely spread, and for which the same cannot be said. It is that of the numerous friends of ser. vitude and platitude throughout Europe, who, jealous of having seen England Preserved from the revolutions which had so rudely shaken themnselves, and of seeing her reasis a pressure of liberty a hundred times stronger than that which had exploded among them, to-lay triumph at beholding her wounded In the heel, and OxclAim ' At last, then, it is her turn ' The English have the instinotive consclousness of the sentiments they inspire, and they confide in themselves alone."1 Envy, that is the word; the Remu has hit it exactly. As to the charge of selfishness, It amounts ~iply to this,-that Eugland has gone steadily ons , augnenting her prosperity, while other countries, less wise, have diminhed theinrby inteinal squabbles atd revolutionary ni& It is quite credible that some of the continental nations hsve not forgotten the contrast offered in 1848 betwieen England, calm and firm, and other nations, torn and trampled on by revolutions4 which none of them knewr howr to direct to the attaiment of ratlonal liberty. But France, which since subm1ttimn, to the guidance of one remarkabln, has regained a brilliant position, and apparently great material prosperity, might aford one woued think, to sympathize with, iteaA of envying, a neighbour and ally, and one regrets to find it stated, on evidence so respectable as the Revue des Deux Afondes, that the ungenerous feeling is the more prevalent. In France, I must own, unwillingly enough, that there is less good feeling on the subiect than I once hoped and would gladly still believe. The convictlon cannot be avoiled when one finds not one, but several Paris journals, themselves not generally unfriendly to England, deolaring it a truth. The Reu expremes the same opinion with respect to other countries, and may possibly be right. The French ought to be too proud to be envious, for envy exists only where there is Inferlority of some kind; and Imust still think that a large cLas of Frenchmaen, the most enlightened, intelligent, and truly liberal, are far from sharing the feeling which ix believed to exist among a numerical majority; and we may, I hope be pretty sure that very few share the rancorous ?eelga or approve the revolting language of such papen as the Vnivers, which, aproS of the Rev. Mr. Culien's letter from Riome, breaks forth in a strain of which the following is a specimen:- " England has irritated God and man. She has -no friends in the world-from ll ides aises against hr a c0ncert of acsations and of sob,s and a earm of blood. If shedoesnot recogize to-daythat hercrueltyandper3cution3 towards the Church have been Immense political faus, she knows nothing, and will not sve herself. . . One knows not by wbat name to iigmxtzethe imbecile fanatcism which blushes not to steal the alms given to the poor widows of the Irish soldiers, and to steal from them afterwards the souls of their orphan children. Yes, yes, England will see the ju3 tlice of God I Mii. de Montalemlbert one day anzounced to her that the revolutionary flamew she had lighted on the continent would reoross the Channel and attack her In the pride of her prosperity. This is not the only retribution she haa to fear, and she wlli pay more dearly tll perhaps for the secular mieries of Ireland. She does penanco, and she ls right; but it is not a day of penitenoe and the repetition of a prayer due to the rhetoric of her proud prelates that can suffice. She must amend so many horrible evils and such long Iniquitiee." This may suffice as a sample of the sentiments which lMt. Louis Veuillot presents upon a Sabbath morning to the consideration of his readers Sulch supporters are a curse to any religion, and we reflect with pleasure that the respectable French clergy generally discountenance and blame the journal that reckons them among its writer According to the telegraphic despatches from Berlin, up to a late hour last nigtht the Kiingt was better, but not out of dlanger. To-day prayers for his rcsovery were to be said in the churches. The troops from ChM-ons Camp have begun to arrive in Paris. The Institution of the medal of St. Helena has brought to light some curious incidents with relation to the old Imperial army. One of the applicant, presented in support of his demand a brevet, entitling him to a sword of honour received in the year 1800, after the battle of Rohenlinden, where he was wrounded. He bad preeetved this document without reflecting that the law of the 29th Ploreal Year 10, creating the Order of the Legion of Bsonour, contains the following clause:" Are members of the legion of Honour all soldiers who have received arms of honour." Another applicant, who retired from the service in the year 1813 presented a brevet of Chevalier of the Legion of Etonour, which he had received at that period, but, not knowving It value, he had never claimed the pension attached to the decoration. Thus these two men were Chevaliers of the Legion of Honour without being aware of the factthe first since the creation of the Order in the year 1802, and the other sce 1813. Their position was immediately rectified, and each has been paid the arrears of the pension for five years, being the utmost allowed by law. The popular comedian Aal is likewise a St. elena medalist. He was an engraver, and resided in Paris In the year 1813, when, carried away by the general enthusiasm of that period, he volunteered for the corps of pupils of the Imperial Guard, institated by Napoleon to receive boys of 14 years of age who should enter the Guard when compatent. Arnal was afterwards received into the corps of Riflemen, and served in the campaign of Saxony in 1813, and in that of France in 1814. Several women who served in the armies of Napoleon I. have claimed the medal, and the Emperor has ordered the claim to be admitted. A letter from Sulina of the 26th of September states that there is at present very little traffic on the Danube, which is accounted for by the aecounta received In Germany of the abundant harvest In the west of Europe. There have not entered the Danube more than 1,000 vesels since the 1st of January, and of these not more than 14 are French. They came from Marseilles and took In cargoes of lor rapeseed for France and corn for England. The cold weather which had set ln would, it was hoped, put an end to the fever which had prevailed during the summer. PRUSSIA. (FROM ou0 OWN CORn PONDEiT.) BERLIN, OCT. 10. The concluding entence of my lat letter Informed you that the King had been prevented by a slight indisposition from paying his intended visit to the Duke of Augastenburg last Tuesday, and I confined myself to this very simple statement of a fact from an unwillingness to enter upon the region of report and conjecture on a matter of so delicate a nature as the King's health is just now. At the date of my lastletter, justbefore thepost went out, a bulletin was publshed of his state of nealth, in consequence, as it was stated, of his having given up the joumney, which first bulletin ran as follows: "Mis Majesty the King has had a less good night thn yesterday. The fever has entirly ceased, but the feeling of fatigue and exhausUon sill continueS. " SCHIONIz1W. " Sans Soud, Oct. 8. W1EISS." Slight Indispositions have been too frequent of late -with the King, and are, moreover, so frequently employed by persons of high estate as pretexts for not undertaking any task that ia irksome to them, for the first intimation of the King's having given up the trip to Primnkenau, the greater part of which was to be passed in the company of the Emperor and Empress of Russda, to produce any great amount of uneasiness or interest; but soon afterwards the indistinct rumour found its way from Potsdam hither that His Majesty was really unwell. The appearance of the bulletin showed that something more than a "s light Indisposition1' was present on this occasion, and the inquiries I have made since I closed my last letter have put me in possession of the following:- The King showed symptoms of indispoition when trave.llng in company of the Emperor and Empress of Russia from Potsdam hither, with the intention of prosecuting their common course together through Silesla; and, at the suggestion and representation of one of his adjutants, he consented to give up his visit to the Duke of Augustenburg, to whose grandchild he was about to stand godfather, and, taking leave of his Russian nephew and niece, he returned to Potsdam.. Here it was found necessary that he should at once take to his bed, great depression, accompanied by vomiting, having ensued; but no further symptoms of an aggravated nature showed themselves, as far as I have heard, during the next 24 hours, and the impression seems to have been that His Majesty would get over this attack, as he had recovered from that at Plllnitz in the course of last July, by resorting simply to rest and quiet. Though the Prince of Prus3ia hadthought it right to stay with his brother rather than go to the christening at Primkenau, so Lttle apprehenslon was felt as regards the King's state that most of the Royal Princes came into Berln that evening and went to the theatre. Prince Frederick Willlam set off after the theatre for Primkenau, and hi. father, the Prince of Prussa, decided the next day also to leave Potdam on the following morning for Muskau. In the course of Wednesday It does not appear that any great alteration took place, but the circumstance that no improvement ensued beyond the cessation of the febrile affection seems to have made the propriety of publishing the bulletin abovemeni tioned evident. On the evening of Thursday, however, the King's state became unetedly worse, and the pressure or blood on tie brain became so oppressive" it the physicans had recourse to blood-letting twlc Auring the night, a treatment to which, with the Kings peculiar state of body, they would only resort In great extremity. The bulletin that was published on the following morning waa as follows:- "Yesterday evening violent congestion inthe region of the brain supervened, which, however, somewhat abated In the ooue of the night and towarda morning. SC]IONLIN. "Sans Souc, Oct. 9. "W1 EISS." It was now considered necessary to eiunmon such members of the Royal Family as were Asill absent. Prince Frederick Wiliam returned immediately from Primkenau at half-past 5 o'clock in the morning; Prince Albrecht, from Dresden; and Prince and Princess Frledrich of theNetherlands, the Mlinister President, and the Minister of Commerce all hastened back toBerlin and Potsdam by special trains on the various railways that centre in thistown. The improvement produced by the bleeding lasted during the greater part of the day and His Majesty slept for several hours, so that in the aftermoon he was able to recognize the Queen and to address her in a few affectionate words. Previous to this the King had been at times insensible, at times asleep for a very lengthened period. Baron von Manteuffel, who came up from his estate in the Lausitz early yesterday morning and repaired at once to Potadam, summoned a Council of ie Ministers for 5 o'clock, and at its close returned to Potadam, where he will remain for the present, as a-nother Ministerial Couneil has been held there this morning. The accounts I have received from Potadm thi morning are very nvouableO ; they show -better having taken place as yet is considered to augur very ill for the eventual result. Yesterday evening I telegraphed to you that the King's illness had taken avery serious turn, and that great fears were entertained for his life, and I trust that you recelved this in time for this morning's first edition. Knowing the great Interest that must be felt in England, and particularly in the relWious world the-a, for the preservation of the King's life and health, Ihavebeenat unusualpains to acquireearlyinformation onthis point this morning, so as, by means of the telegraph, to put the readers of your second edition in possesaion of the latest intelligence. The telegraph officials, however, have refused to forward my telegra,n,* on the ground that it was impossible that I could have seen the official bulletin of that morning, inasmuch as they had not yet received it; my assurances to the effect that I was perfectly Informed as to the contents of that document were of no avall, although the bulletin had been drawn up at Potsdam at 8 o'clock (it was then past 11 o'clock), and the bulletin had been lying out some time for everybody's inspection at the Hof MarschalWs Amt, or Lord Chamberlaln's office. I theu altered its tenourt' so as to make no allusion to the bulletin, and thia even was refuzed again, on the ground that It did not coincide with the other intelligence they had already received. Whatever these latter may have been, or fiom whatver source they may have been taken, mine, derived from private sources, will be found in harmony with those of the official bulletin, which, though drawn u this morning at 8 o'clock at Potadam, is not published up to the moment I write. In consequence of this unwarrantable stretch of brief authority vour readers must wait till Monday, at noon, for the information that they might otherwise have received to-day at noon, thus lodng 48 hours. I shall lose no time in bringing my complaint before the Minister of Commerce, for the sake of otners who may come after me, and have no doubt of his rectifying the evil, for in all that belongs 'o his province the greatest promptness, accuracy, and good management are shown, and their good results are evidenced in the produce of very excellent returns to the State for the capital it has invested under his supeintendence. The present attack under which the King is labouring is in so far a repetition of the attack he had at Pillnitz last July as that It proceedcs from over-exertion, over-anxiety, and a neglect of the requirements of his feeble body, while his overactive mind was being too severely taxed. The symptoms of the former attack rewembled those cf a mild form of paralysis or apoplexy, consisting of total protration of strength, suspension of the bodily and mental faculties, with occadonal wandering In the speech when tlhe organ were so far at liberty as to articulate. These symptoms have shown themselves again on the present occasion, but with more frequent repetition and increased intensity, so that the belief seems to gain ground among the medical men that His Majesty haa but a small bloodvessel in the brain, and that it is the extravasated blood which is now producing this paralyzing pressure on that organ. The circumstance that repeated bleeding has hitherto been unavailing to promote more than a transient alleviation seerns to favour this lamentable conclusion; and I close this letter with the very painful conviction, that I shall ere long have to make a communication to you that will not fail to be received in England with still more lively emotions of regret and grief than the present. In the middle of ast night the King's chaplain, the Oberhofprediger Straus, was, as I hear, sent for to come to'him, and his second body physician, Dr. Gzimm, who was absent In Switzerland for his own health, has been summoned by telegraph to repair to his Royal patient's bedside. P.S. The bulletin which was drawn up this moming at 8 o'clock at Potsdam wax as followsa:- "No change has taken place In the state of lHs Majesy' lilness during the past night. The appearance of congestion continuws to remain as moderat as yesterday morn. Ing." In the course of the forenoon His Majesty's state was still worse than that wlhich the above bulletin served to conceal; but after 12 o'clock a decided change for the better took place, so that the hearts of all around him in Potsdam and here have for the present had an oppresive load removed from them. There was yesterday afternoon a very affecting im proviso service held in the Friedenakirche in Potsdam, and attended by most of the Royal family and the members of the Court; the text was taken from Isaiah, chap. 38, and the sermon on it made a deep impreosion on all present. Prayers are ordered to be put up in an churchesL The Pincess of Pruuia in expected to arrive before nightfaL AUSTRIA. (FROM OcR O0W COesPONDmZwr.) ViNNA, Ocr. 8. We have already occasion to remark that the intervlew between the two Emperors at Weimar will be followed by a rapprochement between their Governments. Count Valentine Esterhazy who represented this country at the Court of Aussia during the war, will receive some other appointment, and it is stated that Count Colloredo, who is at presentA nbasador at the Papal Court, is to be his successor. The Runians still affect to believe that the Emperor Francia Joseph will scrifice Count Buol, but they deceive themselves. It is the will of His Majesty that there shall in future be perfect equality between Russia and Austria, and, such being the cuse, he is not likely to dismiss the man to whom he is mainly indebted for the deliverance of his empire from the Ignominious yoke under which it had so long laboured. While in the theatre at Weimar the Emperor had a conversation, which lasted full a quarter of an hour, with Prince Gortaehakoff, and persons -who are acquainted writh the peculiarities of His Yajesty's character do not doubt that he gave theRunsian Miuisterto understand that he was very sorry to be for a time deprived of the valuable services of hizMinisterforForeign Afairm BeforetheEmnperor Francis Joseph quitted Welmarhe gavel Prince Gortechakoff the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Stehen, which he certainlywould not havedonehad the usasan statesman ventured to criticize the policy of Austria during the war. The Weimar correspondent of the .Acgsburg Gazette states that while His MajestEy was talking in the back part of the box with Prince Gortcakofthe other Russians "drew a cordon round them." The same writer states that the Emperor was somewhat embarrassed when first he foiud himself in the company of strangers, some of whom were prejudiced against him but he sooe recovered his self-possession. The Xstrian Monarch conversed freely with the persons with whom he was brought into contactt, ' but the Emperor Alexander was as cold and reserved (boutone-) as he was at Stuttgart." It is credibly stated that there will not only be a great reduction In the Austrian cavalry, but that the army in the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom will at once be placed on a peace footing. The reduction of the Russian Guard and Grenadier Corps is about to be effected, as we learn by the lnstructions which were Issued by the Minister of War on the 19th August. When the war ended the 'xuard Corps conshsted of 36 active, 24 reserve, and 12 depOt battalions, and the Grenadier Corps was nominally of the same strength; but in future neither of the corps will have more than 24 active and 12 reserve battalions. The strength of the battalions will also be diminsh. In someof the Fench and Prusian papers it Is said that there will soon be a reeting between the Emperors Napoleon and Francis Joseph, but the report is not credited here. A fortnight ago the Governmental organs of the French ress disputed the claim of Austria to be considered a great ?Power, and such an insult is not likely to be soon forgotten by the ruler over 39,000,000 or 40,000,000 of subjects. A Strasburg correspondent writes, that during the last few days a great number of soldiersbelonging to the garrison of that city have recewved leave of absence. Hpe adda, " All arms are likely to be placed on the minrmum of the peace-footing." Of course, such news cannot be suppressed; but it does not at all correspond with the private intelligence which has reahed me. A few days since you were informed that the members of the Catholic Associations in Germany had talked a considerable deal of " nonsense " at Salzburg; but information has been given me that the word quoted ought not to have been employed. When the pious gentlemen met in public they passed their time in making motions of which full two-thirds were rejected, but when they had thei private sittngs theyindulged in an amusenment whxid does not find favour in Austia. They criticized the measures of Govermnent, and came to the conclusion that neither Count Buol, Baron Bach, Baron Briick, nor Baron Kempen wa worthy of the confidence of his Sovereign. The saintly politicians were of opinion that the Minister or Forel Affairs must be considered a lukewarm Catholic because he had not declared war against the unorthodox Rusians; it was maintained that the Mini3ter of the Interior was but a seeming friend to the Roman Church and must consequently be well looked after by the elect. Baron Bruck was denounced as a foreign heretic whose aim it was to ruin the State by abolishing the laws against usury, and modifylng those relative to corporate societies. The statesman who was in the worat odour in the conventicles held at Salzburg was the Chief of the Police, who was accused of showing too much favour to that part of the press which is hostile to the Church of Rome. The subject is a very delicate one to touch on, but,it appears to me that the polUee em,pioijs are afraid to dlschsr;e their duties according to the dictates of their conscience They allow much greater liberty to the UJltramontabne organs of the press than they do to the other papers, and that simply because they are unwilling to give offience in high quarters. In the Augsburg Gazette of the 5th October is a letter "from the Danube," which contains an attack upon that " faction" (the lltranontane party) which maintai that Ro Catholic Austria " ought not to be on a friendly footing with Protestant Prmsia and chismatic Ruumia." The language employed by the writer for the Bavarian paper s so very energetic, that many people fancy they recognize the style of Baron Zedlitz, whose pen isrenownedforthecoarsenesoflitsnib. The Vo?ks6ote, Augs&urg Post Zeiung Deutseland, and other. ultra-Catholic papers which appear m Germany do not thrive, and the remark will apply to the I Volksfreund and KirchenZeitwng,which are published here. The last-mentioned paper is totally unknown to the great publio, and the VoUksfreutnd has not more than 1,000 subscribers. It is, however, probable that the Severinu Association distributes many copies among the labouring class gratis. The so-oaWed Index Commission at Rome has just published a list of prohibited books, and In it figure the philosophical works of Francis von Bader, who was once a profesor in the University of Munich. Cardinal Rieisach, who was formerly Archbishop of Munich, highly approved Von Bader'e works, but MW. Geissel, the Archbishop of Cologne, has demanded and obtained their prohibition. Thus that which in the opinion of the one prelate is orthodox is by the other considered neterodox. During the last day or two opportunities have presented themselves of conversing with well-informed anddispassionate Hungarians, and they are all of opinion that things are not progresaing favourably. They assert that the administration is defective and enormously expensive, and foretell that, sooner or later, some changes must be made. A pamphlet has just been published by one of the employgs In the Home Department, in which It is shown that the Hungarians have no reason to find fault with the new institutions. The Magyars assert that all their ancient laws have been entirely set aside, but the Austrian employe proves that they say " the thing which is not." ",'For," says he, "their laws relative to mixed marriages were so good that they have been introduced into almost all the other provlnces of the Austrian empire." Canthiabe irony? And, if it is, can it be good policy to add insult to injury ? It appears that Dr. Zugschwerdt7 who is the Dean of the Vienna notaries, as well as a member of the Board of the Credit Bank, is a much greater malefactor than was originally believed. He has already confessed that he has pledged the property of several minors to some of his creditors, instead of depositing it in the hands of the authorities, as he ought to have done. His wards and acquaintances lose about 40,0001. by him. OCTOBER 9. The statements of the correspondents of the French paper relative to the meeting of the two Emperors at Stattgart do not tall with those made by the writers for the English and German press, and therefore some information on the aubject, which has been acquired at an official source, may perhaps be acceptable to your readers. TheEmperor Napoleon seemed quite at his ease, and conversed freely with all those persons with whom he was brought into contact; the Emperor Alexander, on the contrary, appeared to be out of his element, and wasshy andreeerved. The former, "who greatly affected the middle of the room," was often engaged in hvely conversation with those around him, but the latter sought out quiet corners, and obviously wished to keep in the back ground. Even after the arrival of the Empress of Russia no change was perceptible in the manner of the Emperor Napoleon, " and he could not have been more polite and friendly with Her Majesty if she had come over from Darmsadt on purpose to meet the Emprees Eug6nie." The Augsburg Gazette says:- " Napoleon, who evidently wished to produce a favourable Impression, was frank, cheerful, and sympathizing (tWinehmend); but the manner of the Czar bore the stmp of cool reserve (der kslien zurickkauung). The rendezvous in Weinar, the arrival of the Ermpress of Russa at the eleventh hour, although it was understood that she was not to appear, and another lady of high rank having in consequence decined to come to Stuttgart, and the sudden disappearance d! the Russians after the first act of the opera, would seem to indicate that the moeting of the monarchs will not lead to any Important result. At all events nothing more has been effected for the moment than that the two Em' perors have become personally acquainted, and that Napoleon hss returned the vlsit which he received last year from the King of Wurtemberg. The cheers which ,ere head were addressed to the gaests of His Majesty th3 King, and it Is even asserted that most of them proceeded from persons who do not reside within the waus of our city." The correspondent, after stating that Prince Murat received t Stuttgart the honours due to Princes of the blood Royal or Imperial, alludes to the current report that he Is a candidate for the throne of the united Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. As Baron Hiibner repaired to the camp at Chalons as soon as he got back to France, the coffeehouse politicians have come to the conclusion that he has been charged by this Government to make the necessary arrangements for a meeting between the Emperors Napoleon and Francis Joseph. Baron Hiibner came here to receive the instructions of his Government relative to the Danubian Principalities, and you may be assured that no meeting will take place between the Emperors Francis Joseph and Napoleon as long as the organs of the French Government continue to disparage Austria. Not a single Austriana aoldier has yet applied fgor the St. Helena medal, and everything is done by the Austrian press to rouse the spirit of the Germanls and to prevent their urging their claim to It. The medal, which is a mark of distinctlon for a Frenchman, would be like a badga of servitude and dishonour for a German. The " Veteran Assoclation!' at Welmar some tlme since declared that any of its members who claimed the St. Helena medal should be ex- pelled, and information has now been reelved that the Government of Hanover endeavours to keep its subjects from bei so base as to accept from France a souvenir .of the humiliation of Germany. Up to the 24th of Sep- tember the "Chancellor of the Order" in Paris had received no more than 5,800 direct applications from Germany. The letter " from the Danube," of which mention was made yesterday, haa created such a sensation here that it is necessary to return to it. Some time ago there was a very violent attack on Count Buol and his policy in.the Historisch-Potische Bltter, a periodical which appears at Munich. The magazine in question is an organ of the Ultramontanists, and the attack on the Minister for Foreign Affairs was here generally attributed to a Jesuitical professor who not long ago removed his penutes from Bavaia to Austria. As has been said, the article in the Augsburg Gazette is by persons :connected with the press attributed to Baron Zedlitz, who is an orthodox Catholic, but too stanch and loyal anAustrian to like the canting hypocrites who have during the last three or four years been imported from fore" countries. MB Hurter, an arch-Jesuit who in former years was greatly Protected by Prince Mettermcl, has just published the eighth volume of his work on Ferdinand IT., who during his whole reignu(froma J61 to 1687) was at drawn daggers with the Protestants both at home and abroad. The FraW.fort Journal reviews the work in questlon, and accuses M. Hurter, who has the high soundlnog 'titleof "CReichs-Historiograph" (Historian of the Empre) o wifuly istrtig,and eveni of sup. presingfacs "n oderto ehailiatethe Jesuits, whose ause ofinfluece andpower ormerl brougt a souvenir of his plgrimage to Mariazell, the Primate of Hungary has given a pIoce of waxtaper,"which was consecratedclose to themiraculous mag of the Vigin," to a church InBuda. It is rumoured here that the Paris Conference Will soon meet again, in order to nettle the question relative to the Danublan Principalities, but nothing positive seems to be known In official circles on the subject. Colonel Mssoud Bey, the chief of the staff to the late Pasha of Bagd4d, passed through this city on his way to Constantinople, where he expect to meet the Sirdar Omar Pasha, who is about to leave for the abovementloned city. According to the colonel, who is a most intelligent man and a first-rate linguist two steamers, which he has purchased for the Turkish Government in Belgium and France, are about to leave for the Tigris, where they will run between Bagdad and Bumorah. A fortnight sinco the Osterreehische Corresponden= gave us to underxtand that nothing would be done by Government to relieve the moneymarket; but you will probably eoon learn that the information not long since received from me on the subject war perfectly correct. No new kind of railway stock will be brought into the market until the year 1859, and the State will construct some part of the lines, and at a favourable moment cede them to the respective companies. In the balancesheet of the Bank for the month of September 16 millions of florins figure as the value of the Bank itself "and other activa." The active property meant is said to be foreign bills to a verr large amount, which will be paid in silver.' It is selfevident that the precious metal will reinforce the stock of specie of the Bank. Such a dearth of money prevails here that the rate of discount for bills of the very best quality is 8 per cent. The second-rate houses must pay 10 and even 12 per cent. Dr. Zugwchwert has not only robbed orphans and widows, but he has "done" many of the members of the Board of the Credit Bank out of their tanfmiNe. His reputation anld credit were so high that some of tho most renowned misers in the city lent him money, and naturally now bitterly repent their want of caution. The total loss to the publc will probably be some 60,0001., as fresh instances of the man' dishonesty daily come to light. The day before yesterda :a silk manufacturer shot himelf, andgyesterday a wholesale grocer Cit his throat. They were both jobbers,and the Viennese,whonever neglect any opportunityofmaking a pun, say that they committed sucide because they had too much credit (Bank stock). Count Buors health is improving. Prince Alexander of Hesse, who has recelved the Grand Cross Of the Order of Leopold from the Emuperor Francis Joseph, has returned here f'rom Welmar. TURKEY. (FiOM OUR OWN CORESPONDEnT.) CONSTANTINOPLE, Ocr. S. Goethe wrote, for the benefit of sentimentail ladies, a clever but rather long novel called Die Waheierwandslaften, in which he tried to prove that individual sympathies follow the same laws of attraction and repulsion as chymical substanceL I think one could make up a perhaps less sentimental, but certainly moreamusmgessayonpolitical affinitles, bygiving a detailed history of a Ministerial change in Turkey. The substances are always the same,Court intrigues Ambassadorial intrigues, and the intrigues of high officals; and the result is likewi6e the same,-explosion ending in smoke; but the combinations of the dferent substances to produce such a valuable result are endless, and so is the amusement which the spectator may derive from them, unless he pities the country which has to suffer from these experiments; and pity it really does deserve. It is these continual changes in the higher branches of the Government which prevent every attempt at improvement. Even in a settled state of things, with a system of Government commanding the support of at least some part of the population, such changes would be dangerous; but In a eountry which has scaeely recovered irom the effects of an expensive war, and which is in a tran- tion state, they must be fatal. Instead of thinkin on reforms, each Ministry, with this Damoeles' sword ever its head must pass it;s short days in fighting for ih o wn existence, and this existenceedepends not on what it does itself but on what others do against It. Even if a Government finds a moment to project a measure which might become useful, it is out of place before it has had time to carry it Into effect, and its successors most probably lay the measure alto. gether aside, or, at the best, carry it out impertectly. It would be unjust and irritatlng foreign influnce to lay t'he blame altogether on the shoulders of the representatives of the great Powers; the evil exists in the country 1tse1fs but it is augmented by ambassadorial interference. The more the connexion between Turkey and Europe becomes intimate the greater becomes the preponderance of foreign over ho-meaffais, and espeeiallydincethelatewarthewhole political movement is concentrated in the former. Besides this, the exceptional circumstances during the war gave to the representatives of the foreign Powrs a much more direct influence over affairs and brought them into freer contact with the Sovereign. I The effects of this were never more apparent than inithe last Ministerial change, and it is lamentable that they were not brought out in the most favourable light. Whoever watched the complieations which led to the interruption of the relations between the Porte and the four Powers had no difflculty in seeing that the old curse of European diplomacy ln Turkey,-namely, personal sympathy and antipathy, played a conspicuous part in them. It was SO much an understood thing that when the relations were interrupted Redschid Pasha received an intimation from the Russian Embassy that, although circumstances led the latter to act in concert with the French Embassy, this was by no means to be attribuited to any il-feeling towards him, and it was with a view of not being an obstacle to some possible arrangement that Redschid Pasha himself obtained the Sultan's sanction to accept his resignation as Grand -iner. When the relations were renewed, Redschid Pasha's final removal from the Ministry was urged on the grounds that no understanding could last while he formed part of the Government. This fall is, therefore, not to be considered as a disgrace, but as a sarifice to a good understanding. with France The Sultan himself haa done his utmost to convince every one of this by the attentions which he has shown alnce to the fallen Grand Vizier, whom he has visited in his own house-an honour only rarely conferred on any one not connected by direct ties of redationship with the Imperial house. Nay, he went furtherhe has dismised his mo3t intimate friend and brother-in-law, Ahmed Fethi Pasha, for having made remarks about the attentions shown to the late Grand Vizier. But, whatever the means were by which the presen' Ministry was formed, it ought to be taken as afait accompli, and the Ministry judged only by its actions ; else there will never be an isue out of this continual uncertainty. The Ministry can scarcely be said to be formed, for with the exception of the president of the Tanzimat Council, ;uad Pasha, and the' Minister of War, Rushdl Pasha, it is+,he aMiit 0which, ReDchd Panh devsedt whet he retired from the post of Grand Vizier. The head or it, Mustafa P , is an aged man who will be only left there until somebody musters courape enough to ascend that slippery port. Who that will be is as yet uncerta, for the political affinities between the members of the Cabinet were never more capricious than at this moment; but as things are at present the choloe seems to be between Aali Pasha and Mehmed Kibrisli, the late Ambassador Extraordinary in Russia. It would be desirable that something should be decided Foon, for while the Ministry is in this embryo state ovarything is at a standstill. The new Ministry has inaugurated its advent by the issue of 75,000,000 piasters of paper money, which has driven up the exchange to 149150, and has spread consternation over the commercial world. If the money be applied to the amelioration of the finance3 it may be pardonable; unfortunately the general impression is not favourable to this supposition. On Thursday last a meeting of English residents was held at Missirie's Hotel for the purpose of raising a subscription for the surviving widows and orphans of the Indian victims. It was numerously attended, with Mr. Cumberbatch, the Consul-General, in the chair. Lord Stratford, who was prevented by indisposition from attending, sent an appropriate letter, In which he announced a gift of 1-,0001. from HIis Matjesty the Sultan, and at the same time made a handsome subosciption for him.- self and his family. The example was followed, and, although not more thin 40 persons were present, above 5001. was raised on the spot. it was determined that several subscrip tion lists should be opNened at the leading bank-- ers and other place, so that there Is every reason to hope that the English residents of this place will not remain behind any other spot In the expression of their sympathies for the innooent sufferers. In a Mussulman country,! the seat of the chief of this religlon, any demonstration, even if only in the cause of humanity against a revolt in which Mahomedans have a large part, was a delicate matter, and was liable to misinterpretation; the Sultan deserves therefore no small credit for breakirg down himself any prejudice in this respect which might have existod in the minds of his people, and condemning, as it were, by his munificent gift the atrocities which have been committed by his eoreligionists. It is true that the rebel Mahomedmas at Delhi belong for the most part to the st of the Shiis, which is detested by the Turks, who are all Surmiis ; but still, in a ease of Islamism tersus Christianity, wetarian disputes might have ylelded to gympathy for coreligionists. The detaDed plan of the railway from Smyrna to Aidin have been given In, and the works have begun. The shares which were left for bubncriptions in the country have been all taken up, and, what is more, are for the moat part paid. The shares of the oKostendjl line have found equal favour with that of Smyrna, they are all subscribed. The works on this line will hkewise begin shortly. It is intended to complete, if poaible,thyearthe dike at Tchernavoda, to shut out the Dlanube, which, when it reaches a certain height, extends inland, formaing a succession of lakres. The Turks show great avidity for investment in railway shareL Nor is this surprising. Investments where the capital may be easly realized In a moment are rare, or, rather, altogether wanting. Houses and landed property are the only investments which the Turks have trusted hitherto, and these are not so easily realized. Most of the rich Turks prefer, therefore, to keep their money under lock and key than to give it out of their hands. It speaks for their just appreciation of European management that they part now so willingly with their money on the word of a few Englishmen. RUSSIA. TheJourlade St.Petersmbourg has the following " On the night between the 16th and 17th of September a great ealamity occurred on the Walkhow, opposite the town of Nov"a -L%doga, where, atthe mouth of the Iadog* Canal, numbers of vessels lMden with merchandie and timber assemble. ShorUy after midnight a tempest arose, and one of the vesels caught fire. The flames, f aned by the wind, spread to some other vesels which had run ahore. The greatest disorder prevailed. The vessels were dashed one against another, and many of them sank. It ws imposdble to give them any assistance, and everything in the direction of the wind er the island and right shore was either burnt or sunk. The wind, coming from the lake, kopt along the right shore; this circumAtanea saved all the vessels on the other side. It is estimated that about 200 veasels of different sizes were destroyed." SARDIN IA. (FROM OUR OWN OOn PsONDzrT.) TURIN, OCr. 9. The Duke and Duchess do Montpensier, who arrived here the day before yesterday from Swltzerland, left Turin tbis morning for Milan, to pay a visit to their relatives the Archduke Ferdinand and Archduchess Charlotte. During their say here the Duke and Duchess were entertained by Eing Victor Emmanuel at the Royal Palace, and they reoelved visits from the Sardinian Ministerx of State and from all the representatives of foreign Powers now in Turin. On leaving Milan the Duke and Duchess de Montpensier wi11 proceed to Genoa, where a Spanish steam frigate is now waiting to convey them to Spain. Sir Thomas Wy6e, Britinh fMinister at the Court of Athene, has been here the last few days, having arrived from Germany (where he has been for his health), and left this for his post yesterday. Since his return to Rome his Holines thePope has given the Sac.ied College a slketch of what occured upon his late journey through Central Italy, and the effects thereof, which he communicated in an allocution delivered in private consistory on the 25th of September, and a translation of which was publihed here yesterday by the Armonia. According to this document it would appear that his Holiness in excessively pleased with the reception he everywhere met with from people, priests, or princes. Speaking of the conduct of the former, he thus passes over the subject of the petitions and addreses, and, indeed, he devotes a very smallportion of his discourse to temporal "Nothing could be more gaifylng than seeing the de. votion of the people themselves and their love for this Apostollo See demonrate In so many ways; so, in accord. anoe with the charity of our paternal mind, -we must speak with tlte greatest pleasure of all the municipalities especlally, of every place and grade, whioh only expressed some special deires and requess regardingthe necessities of their own particular localities and the increase of commercial prosperity, but with that respwect and manner fitted to the most faithful snd affectionate subjets of this Holy See." With the Princes and clergy whom he met In his travels his Holinens was eqully contented, but what delighted him most of all was the excesive joy evinced by all classes on his return to the Eternal City. A letter from Florenoe says - " The Ministry is firmly decided not to make any new oonoession to Rome, and the Bishops who presented the famous petition don't know which leg to danoe upon. They make every offort to deny the authenticity of the docoiment in question." The Direction of the journal Giglio has sought without effect to obtain permission from the Grand Duke to recommence its publication, which, as you may recollect, was suspended for an attack on the Sardinian Govermnent. The editor of thisjournal, M. Mario Cavori, is scandalized at not findinog any support in the Government. In Tuscany, as in Piedmont, the priesthood is losing ground. It is said here to day that the Turkish Charg6 d'Affaires at this Court has presented to Count Cavour within tho last few days a copy of a circular addressed by the Government of the Porte to the European Powers on the subject of the Principalities. In this document the Porte, I believe, agrees to leave the question of the future government of the Danubian Principalities. to a Paris Conference, but does not disguise its own objection to their union. I am not aware if this appeal is likely to alter the line of poliey which the Pledmontese Government marked out for itself on this subject, but I believe that it is possible some recent passages in contemporary history may have had a great effect towards convincing the Government here that its sfest policy, even on questions of minor importance, will be in future to act in unison with those countries whom institutions and sympathies are conformable to those of their own. It appearsthat the difference between this Government and that of King Ferdinand of Naples is far from being smoothed. Notwithstanding all the remonstrances of the Sardinian representative at Naples, I have reason to believe the treatment of the crew of the Cagliari has been as barbarous to te last as lt w at the beginning of their lmpriEonment. They have now been sent down to Salerno for trial, and neither the Cbshrg d'Affaires nor Consul has been able to see them or have their clothes delivered to them. A letter from (enoa, of the 8th inst., informs u3 that on the preceding evening a passenger train on the railway from Alessandria to Arona ran into another train, which was stopping at the station of Valenza. The shock was extremely violent, and more than 40 pasengers were wounded. Fortunately none were killed. The town of Carrara has been declared in a state of siege in consequence of a murder commAitted there on the 28th September. The garrison has been reinforced with 300 men, at the expense of the town. The Duke and Duchess de Montpensier quitted Turin on the 9th inst. for Milan. SPAIN. Our accounts from Madrid, of the 'th inst., state that the latest report current in that city was, that Bravo MSurillo will be charged by the Queen to form a Cabinet. Some persons believe that in such case there will be a dimsolution of the Cortes. Our correspondent, however, Is of opinion that if Bravo Murillo is placed at the head of the Ministry he will present himself boldly before the Cortes, and will be supported by a large majority. It is said that 3enor Marior3, Governor of Madrid, is about to resign. The departure of Count Mrol for Cuba, to rcPlace Genera Concha, aper to be certan.

Jf.R BERESFORD HOPE, M.P., ON CHURCH EDUCATION. The 15th anniversary meeting of the Diocesan Board of Education was held on Friday Lst at Maidstone, in the College schoolroom. There was a very large attendanca of the nobility, clergy, and gentry of the district, among whom were th- foUowing:-Viscount Sydney, Lord-Lieu. tenant of the county; the Earl of Romney, Earl Amherst, Sir Brooke Bridges, MLr. Bereaford Hope, M.P., Mir. What. man, XLP., Mr. Deedes, the Rev. Archdeacon Harrison, the Rev. B. F. Smith, Diocesan Inspeotor; the Rev. Mr. OxenLden, &-c. The chair was taken by tho Archbishop of Canterbury. The Rev. J. 0. B. RiDXsLL, one of the honorary secretaries, having read the report, Viscount SDliEY moved its adoption. The Archdeacon of MAIDSTONE, in seconding the motion, obrezved that It might be taken as granted that the work of buiding schools was well nigh accomplished, although applications for the enlargement of schools where the population Was much on the increase might still be expected; but a fresh department of duty opened upon them-namely, the maintenance of schools in poor parishes where they were too small to avail themselves of Government aid. This wia a subject which had already much engaged the attention of the committee, and would requir the adoption of some soend and clearprinoiple to gaide them. Thetrainingof soheolmas. ters foremaIll chools was also a matter of great importance. These wereprimary objects, but something also must be done to meet the great difficulty which opposed them at every tura -namely, the ve_y early age at which children were taken away from school (Hear, hear.) This practice had the effectofcompletely keeping down that high standard of know. ledge which most people were looking for; but the society would feel it to be of the utmost importance that the seed sown in this short spring time should be the seeds of Ohristian principle-the fear of God, duty to God, and duty to man. (Hear hear.) The committee of the National Society would, Uae was sure, not fail to bear in mind ihe importance of the repreeentation made to it by the Diocesan >oard-namely, that continued watchfulness should be kepb over the measures brought into Parliament, In order that the continuance of Christian training might he preserved, and that freedom from interference maintained which they now enjoyed. (Applause.) The resolution for the adoption of the report was then passed unanimously. IMr. BsEsxFoPD HoPr, M.P., in moving a formal resolution for the reappointment of auditors and lay members of the board, said,-In ridng to propose a resolution affecting to some extent the management of the society, I claim your attention while I make a few remarks on the good work- which we are assembled to-day to promote,-namely, the furtherance of church education. By church education I do not mean merely religious education, but the bringing up the children of the poorer and miuddle classes to perform their duty in every relation of life in the fear of God, at the same time with a view to their own happiness, and the happiness of those about them. This is the work which this society has been set up to promote, and I am happy to say thAt not only this socmety and this county, but the national church and this rat countrt, are now fully awake to the importance of e ping it on by every possible means. I am not one of those who believe that the age we live in is more vicious than any other. (Hear, hear.) No doubt the records of crime and misery everywhere about us are appalling, but I believe it is not the blackness of darkness which has grown darker, but we are blessed more than our forefathers in having eyes to see and cousciences to feel what that blackness is (hear, hear ; and that being so, we have girded ourselves up to ar pp e and to promote the cause of light, and truth, and happiness-that happiness which nothing but religion can give, and so raise the social condition of those who are less affluent than ourselves. Belonging, as we all do, to that pure communion, the church of England-not meddling with those who are outside, not entering into nice questions, but simply walldng 31ong the path on which our own footsteps a: e planted-we are doing our own duty aecording to our own light in our own way. Our contribution to national education is the education of the children of the church of England in the doctrines and principles of that church. AU we look for from the State is fair play. Persons of all opinions have held the brightest antcipations of some national system of education which shall swallow up ali differences-differences which have ever been held in this country with the earnestness which is part of the national character; but I believe that any system of national education which shall thus override all differences of opinion is a perfect chimaera, only to be attained br crushing the coneciences of men, and laying down that as non-essential which they believe from the bottom of their hearts is most essential (Hear, hear.) The denominational system of education fi the only system which cen work well in this country of England. Fair play and no favour-each sect obtaining that share of public support which may be gained by its own exertions, or -which its own contributions may demand by an arithmetical necessity from the national rate-in-aid, and the advantage of which nothing but its own shortcominRs can deprive it. (Bear, hear.) Bat this Diocesan Society and the National Society, and other like useful institutions which are associated under the patronage of your Grace as Archbishop of Canterbury, have undertaken a peculiar department of this work-I mean the moral elevation of the peasant class of this kingdom-a class about which greater delusion has existed than about any other branch of the community. 31any persons have lived in so happy a state of blissful ignorance as to believe that while our towns present all the hideousness of vice and wretchednens our rural districts are all inmocence and happiness. I am sorry to say nothing is further from the truth than such an assumption. (Hear.) God's balance of good and evil hangs pretty equal over both town and country. The rbapsody of the poet that " God made the country and man ade the town" is false in fact as it is bad in principle. Our ex erience would not make it difficult to imagine poor parisaes with few inhabitants, remote from railway communication, with no resident Equire, with a poor incumbent, perhaps zealous up to his means and beyond his means, but those means very insufficient, with the best people in the parish not parti. cularly enlightened, not desirous to see their labourers' children better informedathan their own. This is a state ofthings not impossible to conceive. It is in parishes such as these that the real work of the church of England is ss incunm bent and is as difficult to carry out as anywhere else, and it is here that such soCieties as this perform the best of services. If every parish were reached by railways-if we were centraized up to the uttermost point of tension-then some central body in the metropolis might do the work; but as it is wo must do the Kent work in the Kent way, just as they do the Glocestershiro work in the Glocestershire way, or any other county. (Hsar, hear) We have many towns in this county of 20,000 or 25,000 inhabitantssuh oas Maidstone, Canterbury, Chatham, Sheerness; but we have no great centres of manufacturing enterprise and industry, and it is therefore we are called uponrto do moral work in the rurald wy. We have It to seek in thel woods of our weald, in the deep clay roads, up and down our hills. Although this is a metropolitan county-and I call it metropolitan because London runs into it rather than because it is the seat of your Grace's cathedral-we have as much of the rural element as in the wildest part of Englaud; and we feel that the work to be done is that of Christanizing our parishes, of bringing up our children in the feax of God, -with a desire after public worship, with some respect, at least, for intellectual enlightenment, which is perfectly compatible with true rusticity and simplicitY of character; whicha will not excite them to pine after stations of life to which they can never attain; which wilU not make them pine for town Dleasures which they can never reach, and for town society whfch they can never enjoy; but a Christian, well-conducted, God-fearing, man-respecting peasantry. (Hear.) I have lately returned from a visit to that magnif-cent collection of works of art which is so great a credit to England, but it is not the only sight which is to be seen in Manchester. It is well sometimes to see what is goin on for good as well as for bad in the north of England'. It is as well to see how much they are doing there for the education and comfort of the people, and to find how happy the working classes may be in those great mills which many are too apt to look upon as the scenes of grinding, purse-:roud tyranny on the part of the master, and of hopeless toil and suffering on the part of the operative. I had one day the plssur of visthg one of the largest mills in the north of oundthe operatives looking the very perfection of happiness; the building was fire proof, the venti- lationadmirblge, the people emnployed cleanly, cheerful, andintllient Ithen visted the house of the proprietor-a gentleman whose father had raised him- J from a veryhuml station-a gentleman who toPous and good works, and whsereretonisth clivtin fthe fine arts. After 3my inspection of his millhi ad,"el we are not so bad. in the north as you expectdt idu ' For myself I at once repudiat-ed any suchide,ad o mention the fact as a proof that lclasse ought to understand each other better, and also to show how very susceptible the ianujacturers are of the opinions of rural districts, such as our own, It teaches us also htow necesary it is that we should exert ourselves3if we would not be wholly left behind by the mnaufacturing districts in the religious training of the lower classes. (Hear, hear.) There is one point in the report to which I will now take leave to allude-namely, that which refers to the early age at which the children leave school, or are taken away from school. Perhaps I may be allowed to throw out a hint on this subject. This difficulty may be mAet by considering what is best to be done with respect to the peuiarcast ysoit from which th7e children sprin. I snould be sorry to advocate lowering the standard oour teaching, but I do advocate a greater adaptation of it to the peculiar circumstances of those we have to train up. (Hear, near.) We want something more like what Is called industrial training-a more familiar, common-sense grappling with the necessities of the case. You may nowv meet a girl coming out of a school -ay, and her instructrews, too-who may be able to state the weight of every mountain in Europe and the specific gravity of every mineral, and yet be unable to boil a leg of mutton or hem a pockethandkerchief (laughter), able to pass a first-class examination, bht mable to perform the daties of a domestic servant or a domestic wife. (Hear, hear.) Our peasantry now have a profound contempt for learning; but this is not likely to convert them, or to attract them into the better way. Something has been said of evenirg schools, and there are other ancillary works which do not come within the scope of this society; bat It is high time that we should now go to the bottom of the difficulty. The Archdeacon of Madstone has told us that the schools are built, but that the question now Is how they are to be maintained. If the eduastion imparted in them could have this obviously practical turn, wve should incline our peasartry not only to send their children, but to keep them longer at school, and so swell the box of pence at the end of the year. I vent-ore to press thia consideration on the attention of the committee. Let the schools take a more industrial form; let the children after a certain age come half time, and make them and their parents feel that while they are going on with their eohooling, while they are learningthe grest mortauceof the things that concern thair immortal souls, they are learning that also which will be useful to them in this life. (HeIar, bear ) After the disposal of soma routine business, Viscount Syph- moved a vote of thanks to the Arch- bishop of Canterbury for predldin2.1 The Earl d BE y seconded- the motion, which wa carried by ac,ltmation. compliment, said that he would be wanting in amost impor tant duty if ha had absented himaelf fron a meeting like the resent. This was a society in which not only the clery, tuthe lt',took grt interest, and so long as that interest was maintaed he felt that no expense would be spared to Carry out Its objects. He thought they had muoh reason to be thankful for the success that had already attended the operations of the society. No fewer than nlO additional ScTools had been built during its operation, and it was remarkable in passing tbrough the villages to observe how attractive the school-houses now appeared-how unHlke what they used to be, when they were more calculated to repel than to attact. The hon. memnber for Maidstone had alluded to the difficulties which attended rural schools, and long experience had convinced him (the Archbishop of CanterburT) thet thoe difficulties oould not be exaggerated. Sundayschools afforded a marked example of the difference between town and oountry. A friend of his had assmred him, as an illustration, that he had far more trouble in a rural parsh with a very small Sunday-school than he had aftorwards in the manufacturing town of Bolton, in a Sunday-school numbering 1,200 scholas, and where he had ateaher for every 10 or 1 to helph With regard to evening sohools, he felt rauch hesittion in pressing thema upon the clergy, because he knew how harda thng It was, after being employed the whole day in pastoral work, to turn out and spend two or reehoursin the arduous task of trying to imparta little knowledge where there was much dulness, and to put a little spiit into minds which were slow to receive it. At the sae time, wvhere there was zeal and proper means, and healthallovved, he did not believe the clergy would find anything more useful in caring out the great purposes of their holy office. (Hear, hear.) The meetinlg then separated.
I TO TH ECDITOR OF THE TIJIES Sir,-Although all must admit that your endeavours to Irouse the letent energy,in the country Is most laudable, I confess I was rather surprised In a late nuamber of 2Te 2brnes nowspaper to read an article not pennod with that acteness anA discrimination that distinguishes your journaL In an appeal to members of yacht clubs, in the first place, you fairly enough expose the universal, or all but universal, bungling of officials, when you pass your strictures upon the ineffioiency of our gunboats. They either draw too mLch water, or sail too slow, or their engines break down; and you proceed to show how useless sauch vessels are generally for the purpoEes for whioh they were built, and for India in particular, where, you justly observe, they have to contend with a river with shoals, saadbanks, cataracts, and rapids These are combinations and varieties of obstractions hard to be overcome by vessels of any construction sup. posing they al exist. But you go on to remark, why do the members of yacht clubs content themselves with " sailing round and round the'Mediterranean" when such work is on hand? Open tqcorrectlon, I humbly ask how could they mead the matter? Their yachts possess most of the disqualifications of a gunboat, in being totaly unsuited to contend 'with shoals, saudbanks, or rapids, and with the additional disadvantage that not above half-a-dozen, perhaps, are propelled by steam. Bsing baft for sailing on the sea they cannot grope their way through mudbanks, and if of sufficient size to make the passage out and stow water, provisionw, &c., for their crews, wil draw at least U1 feet of water. In what way they are to ascend such a river as you bave justly described the Ganges to be I am at a loss to coneive, and if towed up, of what use could they by any possibility be as ships of war ? But you might justly have used your powerful pen in showiug how remiss Government has been In not having constructed at the cutbreak df the mutiny, out in India ilats, for the purpose of ascending theee rivers, carryini troops, ammunition, coals,* and, above all, gns& These flats might have been easily constructed dnring the time that it would have taken our long-legged gunboats to get out to Calcutta, and prepared for the reception of their machinery and screw-propellers, which might have been shifted into them. In this way you might have supported your forces by flanking their march, by landing heavy guns, by pontooning, and in many ways suiciently obvious. In China, the other day, most of our gunboats grounded before they got within range; the heavy junks had all to be taken by men in row boats. The junk is bauilt after the fashion of the section of a ask, with no keeL They float over shoals, and carry heavy guns, and are easily onough propelled with sweeps,-long oars. Flate propelled by steam, and properly armed, might have been of essent'al service in the Indian campaign. Allahabad, Agra, and Delhi on the Jumna night have all been reached speedily with troops and heavy ordnance, and Sebastopol tells us what good soldiers sallors make, where batteries and the use of heavy guns come luto play. Bat this, like all other Ideas in the least approach to the idea original, has been neglected. The Shannon, by Lord Eigin's foresight, went to Calcutta, aDd her gallant commander has ascended the Ganges. But this was merely a chance blow. It requires no deep strategist to see at one glance at the map of India where the courses of the Indus and the Ganges, with their trlbutaries, run. In the old wars they had no steam; and so, I suppose, it would be too great a departure from routine to march or move in any other way than Clive or Lake did. I fear the members of the yacht clubse can help but in one way, which is by means of their purses. Perhaps those who are in Parliament may by their eloquence, If they possess any, or at least by their votes, support such measures as are vigorous for prosecuting avwar that for every reason, social and political, requires from England all the exertions of her children. Let us hope there are but few politicians (I believe there is but one) who would attempt to create political capital out of so great a national disaster Your pen saved many a valuable life before Sabastopol; it may now avenge many a cruel slaughter.

OPEN-MG OF A DRY DocK 1K THE MA19PInUS. The 13th of July was si4nalized ini the Mfaurtitus by the opening of a vast dry dock and all the 6dues of the inhabitants assembled to witness the entranco therein of the Northemn Light, a vessel of some 1,600 tons burden. The weather was favourable, and by 2 o'clock the seats reserved for the ladies at the back of the basin were all filled, and the large vessel moved mnajestically to the place destined for her, the sailors singing t'heir usua song as they warped her In. The door of the basin was then shut and the pumap set to work; all this occuipied abouit an hour. The ladies were then conducted to a splendid collationa prepared under the vast open building with its domied iron roof, Covers were laid for 200 persons, and after iced champagne and other wines had freiely circulateel Mr. P.

PUBLic AusEmsNsTs iN AatERICA.-The tightness in the money-moarket does not affect the spirits of our people so far as to keep them away from places of amuse. ment.

Mr. CnrIDzy undertook that the pawn-ticket for the watch should be given up; aso, that the matter of the felt should be satisfactorily eplained in the course of a fort- 11HNoun said that the bankrupt might pas his exa minatlon when this had been done, and ordered an adjourn. ment accordingly. RE ARRZ IAM JACO3s, JOHN JACOS, AND HERY JACOOS The bankupts were merchants of Crown-street, Pimnbury. This was an adjourned examination meeting. Mr. Lawrence appeared for the assgnees; Mr. Bagley (Instructed by Mes. Linklater and Hckwood) for the The case occuphid so protracted a hearing that it can only be notioed in the forn of a deecripive summary. The bankrupt, Abraha m Jacobs, and his two sons, in alleged partnership with Solomon Solomons, carried on the above business. There was Also an Australian firm, consisting of Henry Jacobs and Solomons. The elder Jacobs, having for 30 years carried on business sucoemfully and acctunmulated a capital of 10,0001., embarked 8,7001. in the firm, on an undenstanding that his profits should be in the form of 5 per cenLt. interest for his money. In 1852 was coomenoed the course of maidng consgnments to the house in Ars. tralia, Solomons being established at Melbourne and Henry Jacobs at Bendigo. Consignments were made to the amount of 70,0001. In 1854 the London firm becoming aware that the trade was unprofitable ceased to make consigrnments, and in February, 1855, they petitioned this court for private aran ement. A saXtement was submitted to creditors showing debts 24,0001., and assets sufficient to pay 40s. in the pound. An inspectorhip was appointed. r,0004, was receivedunder that inspectorship, which sufficed to pay a dividend of 6s. 6d. in the pound. There were thus left debts, 17,000h, and although there were stili alleged outstanding consignments to the amount of 39,OOh. not a shilling has yet been raalized therefrom. Mr. lawrence said that Solomona, with whom the other bankrupts held that there was a partnership to all Intents and purposes, although there was no partnership deed, had denled that he was a patner at all, and he stated that having received the gcods as consignee there had been such depreciations and losses that he had nothing to hand over to the estate. His esatements were considered evasve and unsatisfactory, and the assignees have instituted a Chancery suit against him in the colony. Henry Jacobs on returning in 1856 to England had left everything in the hands of Solomon; who was his brother-In-law. A warehouse at Melbourne which was alleged to have cost 10,0001. had been assigned to Solomons, and was said to be of the value of only 1,0001. Henry Jocobs admitted that certain letters sent by him to England giving a favourable view of affairs in Australia had been only a sort of a filourish to eme the mind of his father and brother. The present rtate of things had created in the minds ofthe assignees a suspicion against all the bankrupts. Theywereimpelledtotheconclusion thatit mightbethoresrut of some arrangement by which the creditors were to be de. prived of their rights. After the representations under the spectorship it was not very agreeable intolligence for the creditors that they were not to receive a shilling from the 39,0GOI. of consignments, and that they must submit to tha hazards of a colonial Chancery suit. It was a remarkable fact that the bankrupts had refused to join in any power of attorney which would assist the assignees in pro3ecuting their rights against Solomons unless the creditors gave them a release. The asdgnees were willins to take a favourable view of the conduct of Abrahamand John Jacobs; but they asked that in any case the other bankrupt (Henry Jacobe) should not be allowed to pass until they had got to the bottom of these transactions. Mr. BAGLEY urged that this was the fourth adjournment; that every creditor knew of the intended destination of the goods; that in 1854 the bankrupts had countermanded orders of large amount; and that Henr Jacobs had transmitted the 7,000h after the suspension of the firm. His HoNopassed the examination of Abraham and John Jacobs, and adjourned that of Elenry Jacobs, IN RE P. P. P. BBOOCRn. The bankrupt was a goldsmith, of S6, Newman-street, Oxford.street, Hils debts are 8,OOh; * assets about 1,0001. hlr. Charles artin (Blogg and Martin), and Mr. H. 3manuel, of 5, Hanover-squae, were now appointed the assignees, and Mr. Chidley the solicitor in the case.
.MIDDLESEX SESSrONS, Monday, Oc4 12. The CouxT sat this morning at Clerkenwell, and proceeded with the new applications for licenses for music, aud muslc and dancing, under the statute 25th George IL cap. 36; Mr. Pownll In th'e chair. There were 96 ppl ations for the license for music, and 11 for that for mudc and dancing. The CiTAinsr& stated that out of 335 licenses 111 wre for the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, Shadwell, and WapPing. There were six new applications for houses in Witechapel, and 10 in St. George's.in-the-East; there were seven for licenses for houses in one street in the latterparish, and the licenses given for the east end were as many as those distributed over the rest of the county. He repeated an observation he made at the sitting of the Court on Thursday Lest, that steps would be taken by the Bench to prevent persons going about, as was now the case, inducing parties to make these applications, representing that they had some particular infuience or privilege in obtatiing the licenses, when, in fact, they had nothing of the kind. Such a practice was most reprehensible, and could not be tolerated. In a ease which came before the Court, an application by Danmei Werner, the petition set forth that an informatlon had been laid against him by a common informer for giving musical entertainment in his house without a license, and, In answer to the Chairman, Werner stated that he had to pay the informer, a person named Newton, 151. to compro. inise it, and the costs made the sum he was muleted of W11. He asked the Court to protect him from such extortion by granting him a lihense. He was a beerseller, and had given music some years without the license. The application was refused. In another case the parson who was called to prove the notices stated, in answer to the chairman, that he was employed to do so by Mr. Reynolds, and received lOs. for the service of each set of notices, but what Mr. Peynolds charged the applicants he could not say. Mr. Reynolds had 36 applicUtions on the list. Ax applicant stated after hls petition had becn dlsmissed, as nearly all the others were, that the person named Newton had obtained 21. 4s. 6d. from him by stating that that was the proper charge to make for the application, and producing a letter which he said was to that effect from the Secretry of State's Secretary. He thought it a hard case, and that Newton ought to be sued for false pretences. Newton said he made no such representation; and the letters he showed were one from the Hiome-office and one from the chairmarh himEelf to him. A certain person (Reynolds) had been going about representing that he alone was authorized to make these applications in the district of the Tower Hamlets, and the chairman and the Secretary of State were written to, and it was the answers received that he showed to prove that he was not solely authorized. Mr. Powvi.u asked him how he dared to show his letter to represent that it authorized him in any way whatever? eLNewton said he only showed It to prove that somebody else was not authorlzed. Mr. PO'%vYALL said this grievous state of things would be remedied before next licensing day; and, with respect to the letter of his which Newton had, it was simply an answer to one sent to him; It showed that when a gentleman acknowledged or answered a letter from a stranger there was no knowing the unscrupulous use that might be made of whab he wrote. Nearly the whole of these licenses were refused. In opposing an application made by Mr. SnIMGH on behalf of Leuis Guirard for a license for a restaurant at Saville-house, Leicester-sqnare, Mr. BODUxr (who was instructed by Messrs. Allen for the parochial authorities of St. Ann's, Westminster) ob. served thatthe reoent disclosures as to the state of some of the principal thoroughfares and places of public reaort in the metropols seemed to indicate that the time had arrived when the amentable state of things in this respect made it Incumbent upon the Government to consider whether the evil could not be controlled by arrangements anolagous to those of continental cties, wherprobably, In proportion to the population, there was an et if not greaer amount of vice and depravity; but where any revolting exhibition of barefaced profligacy in the public streets was unknown. The learned gentleman concluded by expressing an earnest hope that a saubject of such pressing and vital importnoe would not be thought undeserving the sttention of the magistry of the metro. polltani oounty.

Theyt said theyknew nothing about it, bui on the way to the station Martini said he was very sorry on account o his poor mother, and that he had been persuaded into it by Morfee. He said he went home with Morfee on Tuaeay night last, stayed with him all night, and in the morning they left together,Morfee carrying some boots in a handkerchief. Morfee went out of the front door of No. 80, leading into N'ewgate-street, and he Martini) went out of the back door with a pair of boots in his pocket They afterwards went to a beershop in a passge leding to the clothes mart in Petticoat-lane, where they met a man who Introduced them to tho landlord, to whom they sold five pair of boots for 1 4s.

ARTILLERY FOR INDIA. The splendid screw stearship Australasian, Captain J. Sceales, belonging to the Royal Mail Company, left Southampton yesterday afternoon with a heavy nail for Malta, :Egypt, Aden, Ceylon, the Australian and New Zealand colmies, 30,3201. in specie, jewelry value 2,0001., and a full cargo, including a large quantity of military stores. She also takes out a total of about 150 passenges (a few of whom join the ship vid MarseiUes), among whom are 13 officers of the Royal Artillery, and a number of medical msn attached to the army, on their way to India by the overland route. Two companies of the Royal Artillery, numbering 221 rank and file, also embark by this steamer for the same destination. The troops, comprising three officers and 110 men of the sixth company 11th battalion, and 6 officers and Ill men of No. 8, Captain J. E. Thring's company, 2d battalion, Royal Artillery, arrived at Southampton at mid-day on Sanday by railway from Woolwich. They embarked Immediately on board the Australasian, vhich went out of dock between 4 and 5 o'clock the pame afternoon, enthusiastic cheers being exchanged I between the troops and the crowds of spectators who had assembled in the docks to witness their embarcation. The gallant ship lay to in the river off the West India buoy till yesterday, when she received the remainder of her mails and sailed about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The following is a list of the Artillery officers who have sailed in the Australasian :-Lieutenaut-Colonel E. Maberly, commanding; Lieuienant George J. Smart, acting Adjutant; Lieutenant T. B. Strange, aoting Quartermaster; Captains J. E. Thning and W. N. Waller; Lieutenants Robert C. Smith, H. A. Tracey, J. Robertson, Samuel Cotter Kyle, E. de L. Tarleton, and B. C. Cuthbert; Asslstant-Surgeon Andrew R. Smith. Among the passengers is Mr. Champion Wetton, who ascompanies the troops as far as Suez, for the purpose of superintending the arrangements for their comfort during the transit on the part of the Royal Mail Company. Mr. Wetton is going out to Australia for two years to under. take the general superintendence of the mail service by the Suez xoute with the whole of the Australian colonies, and to get the system into good working order. Pending the arrangeraent of this service the preparations for the establishment of the Panama route will necessarily remain in abeyance. Having lately returned from Australia, where he has been engaged on a special mission conne:ted *vith this question, and having had great experience in matters of eteam navigation, there is every probability that, under Mir. Wetton's guidance, the postal service with Australia will now work better than it has hitherto done-_ desideratam alike to the colonists and the inhabitants of the nw%her country. m r. C. A. Arney, late of the Western Circuit, and Recorder of the city of Winchester, also goes out by this steamer, to enter upon his duties as Chief Justice of New Zealand,-a position for which his qualities as a scholar and a gentleman well bstit hinm. He joins the Australasian at Malta, rid Mlarseilles. The departure of this noble vessel excited great kiterest, and several of the directors of the Roal Mail C'omnany were among the numerous staff of visitors who witnessed her leaving port. The whole of the arrangements had been completed in the most satisiactory manner urnder the directions of Cap' aln W. Vincent, the company's superintendent, and nothing seemed w.anting to insure the comfort and welldoing of all on beard during her voyage up the Mediterranean.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMfES. Sir,-In Nazpier's Peningular War, vol. vi., page 265, is the following - " The Spaniards stopped, and, though the adventurer Downie, now a Spanish General, encouraged them with his voice and they kept their ranks, they seemed Irresolute and did not advance. There happened to be present an officer of the 43d Regiment named Havelock, who, being attached to General Alten's Staff, was sent to ascertain Giron's progress. His firy temper could not brook the check. He took off his hat, he called on the Spaniards to follow him, and, putting spurs to his horse, at one bound cleared the abattig, and went headlong among the enemy. Then the soldiers shouting for I El chico blanco,' the fair boy, so they called him, for he was very young and had light hair, 'with one ehock broke through the French," &c.

AL.A.KmiNG FutEs.-On Saturday afternoon last a fire broke out at Charlton.on-Ottaoor near Biceeter, which caused the destruction of a conaideraule amount of property before it could be extingaished. It was occasionedby some children at play with lucifers in Mr. Dodwell's barn. They were making a fire, which soon extended to the loose straw in the barn, and the building was quickly in flames, The fire then caught a barn and a small haystack in Mr. Rogors's promises, then spread to Miss Osborn's farm where a barn and oontents were consumed. In the meantime the straw in Mr. Clemeuts's yard, on the other side of Mr. Dodwell's barn, ignited: this communicated to his rickyard, and all were soon in a blaze. Adjoining this farm were three small ricks, the pronerty of Thomas Hopcraft and his son, which also caught fire. The Bicester engines were sent for, but before they arrived the greater portion of the nicks on Mr. Clements's farm were too far consumed to leave any chance of saving them. They were, however, of service in preventing the spread of the flames to neighbour. ing ricks. The fire continued during the whole of Saturday nighti and was not entirely got under till mld-day on Tues. 4ay, The following property was destroyed :-Mr. Cle. merits's ricks of corn and hay were all consumed, with the exception of a few tons of hay, which were much damaged. His loss must be something like 4501. He is insured in the Connty Fire-office; but we are sorry to hear it is only for 2001. Mr. togers is also insured in the same office, and his loss (about 1001.) is fully covered. Mr. Dodwell's and Miss Oh,..ra's 'losses are asIo about 1COI. each, and they are adequately insured. Thomas Hoperaft, sen., had a rick of beans burnt, value about 20 guineas; he is also insured. His son, who has lost twvo small ricks, is not insured. The bulldings on Mr. Clemenss farm, the dwelling-house excepted, were all consumed; but by the activity of friends and neighbours the horses, waggons, Implement% and three loads of thrashed wheat were rescued.-Bucks HeradL [a gdveid6sement.jnps of India, Delhi, &c., published by Edward stanford s, ChaIneg-cross, S.W. -L Stwftord's Map of India, includlig all the ioc Iltls of the Svp,y Insurrection, the railways, mill. tars and Dose-offce Atations. the latest territorial acquIsitIons of the ffitiah. the indeptndentand protected States, anddIagrams exhbhtln d-lstance3 and. bearILgs of the thre prealdeacles of Beo~al, Medra', ang Edombay: two larger sheets 9&a 6d. ; eases 25bs rollers varnished, £1 Us. 6id. 2.

DOUBLE MZT DEE.,iVD ATTEMPTED2UMIUDE. A man arid his. 'wife vere murdered and an attempt at suicide vas made by the murderer on Saturday niight aboua l three and a-htalf miles from Bath. The scene of tho murder' is a picturesque spot, situate in the parish of Bathford, von an estate inhabited. by Mr. H. D. Skrine, and knownx by the namo of WVarleigh-house. The victms are a man a;nd rife, sraced Andrewv and Sarah Border, of the respective I ages of 25 and 29. The husband was in the service of Mr. I Skrine as groom, and resided with his wife in a teottage i adjacent. The murderer, whose name is Thomas Miller, and aged 23, *aso wosrked as labourer upon the farm, and lived In one of a block of cottages situated about 400 yards from the residence of his vietins. The following is a summnary of the particulars connected with this horrible traged. t was stated by several persons in the neighbourhood that-since the committal -of the late murder at Leigh'woods, and wioh was fully reported in 7the TitiMes attbe time, severel -conversations had 'taken plaeo between the murderer end his victims in refeence to that tragedy, and the former bhad been taunted by the two latter with being like the unfortunate womtan's murderer. This, it is said, preyed much upon his mind, protuciDg a state of insanity which at times rendered him almost dangerous. On the day previous to -which the deed was committed Miler had beexn suffering from ill-health, and was visited on Saturday evening by Border and his wife, for the purpose of inquiring whether or not he had recovered. As soon as they arrived at the house they opened the door, and found liller sittin; in the kitchen, and directly inside the door. After asking him hovr he was Miller jumped up and rushed towardsthe door. and with a knife fatally stabbed his two visitors. The mother of the assassin, bearing some one at the door, came from downstairs, and was partially an eye-witness of the horrible scene. The murdered man ran into the lane adjoining and the woman staggered a short distance into the garden, when she fell backwards. Intelligence was immediately conveyed to the house of Mr. Skrine, and the butler sient at once for medical assistance. As soon as possible Mr. 0. Edwards, surgeon of Batheaston, was in attendance. He found the murdered man at the cottage dangerously wounded, but in a sensible state. Upon examination the surgeon found that Border had recoeved a severe gash in hib abdomen, which had penetrated through the trousers, permitting a large portion of the bowels to protrude. The woman was discovered a few yards from the door, lying upon her back, with her head against a border stone. She was quite dead. She had received a stab in the left breast, and the back of her skull was fractured. Every attention was then paid by Mr. Edwards to the murdered man, but he died in about two hours afterwards. Search was in the meantime made for Miller, and after sonme trouble he vwas discovered lying against the wall at the end of the garden with his throat cut, and a quantity of blood over his person and upon the ground. There was little blood in the locality in rhich the woman was found, which might be partially accounted for by the inolemency of the weather, the rain having fallen for some considerable time. Search was then made, and a long clasp knife was found under a chair in the room with a auantity of blood upon the blade, and with which there is littledoubt the murders were committced. After taking Miller into custody he was removed to his houee, and upon further examination it was found that he had received a stab in the abdomen. Both wounds were at once sown up by Mr. Edwarzds. A small penknife was afterwards found in the garden, with which it is supposed the murderer attempted suicide. Information was then conveyed to Mr. Bruges Fry, coroner, who held an inquest yesterday upon the bodies at a room adjoinmsng the house in which deceased Hved. The coroner having directed the jury to the importance of the case they were to adjudicate upon proceeded to view the bodies which wero lying side by side upon the kitchen floor of their own residence. The following evidence was then adduced:- Superintendent Thomas Morgan, of the oounty police, stahioned at Weston, near Ba'b, deposed that he received information of the murder from Pohce-constable Waters, of the Bathford constabulary. On arriving at Border's house he found the bodies of Border and his wife laying on the floor quite dead. Witness noticed a stab in the abdomen of Anarew Border and a quantity of blood upon his stomach. The trousers had been removed in front. Also noticed that the woman had been stabbed just above the left breast. There was a small quantity of blood round the wound. Witness then went to the residence of Thomas Miller, the supposed murderer, and proceeded upstairs. Saw him in bed with a wound in his throat. He was in the custody of Policeconstable Stockton. The prisoner was unable to speak and unfit to be removed, and is so at the present moment. Witness went into the garden and found, or was present when Daniel Hancock found, a linen bonnet. It had a cut on the left side, and was slightly stained with blood. Also found the knife produced in the prisoner's room. It was partly opened and stained w.ith blood. [The knife is a large singlebladed clasp one, about 5 inches in length in the blade.] Thde Coroner.---l'hen, whom do you charge with this Witness.-Thomas Miller I charge with the murder of Andrew Border aEd his wife, Sarah Border. Police-constable Waters deposed to receiving information from Robert Baylis, the butler, and proceeding to the scene of the murder. When he entered the deceased's room the surgeon was there. Deceased said, Oh, Mr. Edwards, what do you think of it? blr. Edwards replied, " My dear man, may the Lord have mercy on your soul !" Border did not speak afterwards, and died in about five minutes. Previous to this conversation deceased asked for his poor wife, and shook hands wich George IHeard, the gardener, and said good bye. Witness also saw Sarah Border lying dead in Mrs. Bradfield's house. Witness then descrited the appearances of the wounds, also to finding the prisoner and the knife with which it i3 supposed he attempted suicide. The prisonser had upon his person a purse containinm 21. lOs. and a key. Thomas Battenbury, parish constable of Bathford, received information of the murder about 10 winutes before 9 o'clock on Saturday from Walter May, the other parish constable. He said there was murder at WVarleigh, and I (witness) must go immediately. I went iaimediately to deceased's house and sawv Mr. Edwards, the surgeon, dressing a wound in Andrew Barder's abdomen. Mr. Edwards said, " I don't want you here; go in search of the man who did it." TI-omas May and his son Walter told me that it was Thomas Miller who had done it. I went to Thomas Miller's house, and the people inside told me that he was not there. I then went to MIrs. Bradfield's adjoining and sew the dead body of Sarah Border lying on the floor. I afterwards went to a garden which I have been informed belonged to Daniel Hancock. There I heard a noise, and, on approachIng nearer, I found Thomas Miller lying on his face covered with blood. On raising him up I searched his right-hand jacket pockets and found the razor now produced. 'There was no blood upon it. I then, assisted by Thomas May, Mr. Skrine's woodman, bronght the prisoner near to bis house and placed him in a chair, and stayed with him antil Mr. Edwards the surgeon, caine, who gave us orders to take him into the house. Mr. Edwards then dressed his wounds. The prisoner said that he cut Mr. and Mrs. Border with the largeknife and himself with the small one, Prisoner was then sensible. I have known him for five years, and I believe him to be of sound mind. Have never known him confined in a lunatic asylum. He has been a quiet man, and as parish constable I never have had reason to complain of him. I took him into custody and charged him with the murder of Border and his wife. After the prisoner was in bed he said to me that Mr. Border had come to him with his (prisoner's) large case knife and threatened to rip him up, and he did cut him in the belly -.nd he (prisoner) cut him. I asked him if he knew he was dead, meaning Border, and prisoner replied, "'No, he is not dead." I then said, "Why did you strike his wife ?" He replied, " I struck her with my arm like that (moving his hand at the same time towards his head), but I did not kill her, and I do not believe she is dead." I told him she wvas dead, and he made no reply. In the course of the night he said he had not injured either of them. He did not appear to be the worse for liquor. During the night the prisoner was delirious, and charged me once with cutting his belly. Daniel Hancock, labourer, in the employ of Mr. Skrine, deposed.-On Saturday evening at 5 o'clock I came home with the prisoner from the farmyard where we had been at worlr. He seemed very dejected, and I asked him what was the cause. He replied, " They are all against me, and want tc poison me." I asleed him who they were, and for what oause they wanted to do so, and said, " Is it me ?" He replied It was some of them down there, but he didn't know who. I said to him, " You do seem to me ' ranged,' and I shall go and tell your mother." We then separated. I went into my house; she went into his. I then went to the farm and told his mother she had better come down and M te c of him. I have known prisoner for nine -ears in service, where he bus been for a longer period. He las been quiet, but flighty at times, He never appeared a dgerous character, and never was in confinement. to my knowledge. Do not x-now the reason he was in this low esponbdifng way. Never knew himto commit any act of vio- Coroner-Now, tell us about the act of violence he committed on Saturday night. Witness.-I was seated by my own fire between S and 9 o'clock, had my boots off, and was going to bed, when I heard a scream. My wife, who was outside, said, " Daniel, come out." I put my boots on, and went out and saw Sarah Border lying down on the ground. There vsere my wife, Jane Hancock, and Eliza and Elizabeth Bradfield standine by her. Somo en said, "1Tom ;MiU1ezr ha,d _d-ono it." Y ran after Tom MUler and halloaed out " Tom, Tom, Tom." I then heard Border say, " Daniel, Daniel, do come and help me ; Tom Miller has been and stabbed me." I went and found Border standing in the lane doubled up. I then put my hands round his middle to keep him from faUing, and took him h',me, assisted by Mr. Hurd, the gardener. Deceased said, '- Where is my dear wife P" and bid me go and seek for her. I then went to her and found she was dead. The knife prodaced is the property of Thomas Miller. I have noticed him at times flighty. I mean by that he acted more like a boy than a man, riding donleys backwards, instead of forwards, and acting ' ldolhardy manner. I have seen Mrs. Border at Miller's house several times. I believe they were living on neighbourly terms. I never heard any one joke him about the murder at Leigh-woods. The Coroner.-Did you ever hear any one say he was like the murderer,-tbhat's the point ? Witness-No, Sir. By a Juror.-I fancied he was not well on the Friday night. On the morning of the murder I heard my wvife say that the prisoner had been ill all night, and that he was light heaced. Jane Handcook then deposed to calling her husband, and other facts previously sworn to by the former witness. Sarah Rippin, wife of James Rippin, coachman to Mr. Slrine, then deposed:-During the week before the murder I saw Thomas Miller. He complained of having a eold, and being unwelL On the Saturday mor,,ing Le met me about half-past 8 o'clock, and said that be bad had a bad night, had been fighting with the Indians, and must fight 'themn, sain; da if he got away from them he should&l ;:va' fineoqitse lo'Hve In.

I iuouirel c f Mrs. Border, and found it was not true. I and mychild-en went toMrs. Border'sandlocked ourselves in, and. thepritoner vent away. Mr. Border thea oamehome and hid histea, and ve all stayt - there until half-past7. I and my childrenthen retrTnea home and left Mr. and Mrs. Border at their owa horse. About 20 minutes afterwards . Mrs. Sane Haridcook came to my house and asked mne for a lantern, sayin that Mr. and Mrs. Border were laid In the road in fits. I gave her the lsntern and then I saw Eeard and Handconk bnugirg Mr. Border home, who said " I am a dead man." I stayed with him an hou r while they went for the doctor. He Paid he was dying and asked me to py for him. I said, "How did it happen!" and he said, " Tam did it," meaning M.lJhr. He then said, "Se has served her the same." By her he mean' Mrs. Border, for he several times asked for his poor wife. He kept prayin"a very earnestly till Mr. Edwards camne, ata quatter past '9 o olock. Conway lhomas Edwsards, surgeon, deposed.-I reside at Batheneton. I was sent for on 8aturday last by Mr. Baylis, Mr. Srire's butler,to attend in Warleigh-lanes amanwho had been stabbed, and was told that tha man who murdered him was supposed to he about the lane. I was ordered to go to the second lodge in the Iane and I did so.. I got there about a quarter past 9 o'clock, and saw a man lying on the floor ofthe house whom I ascertainefto B Border, the groom at Mr. Skrine's. There appeared to be on his abdomen a mass of blood and intestines. The upper part of his trousers was saturated with blood, as also were his shirt and flannel waistcoat. On exatnining the mass of what I supposed to be the intestines% and finding that it was so, I cut down his trousers so as to be enabled to slip them off without much difficulty. I then searched for the -wound through whiuh the intestines had protruded, and found an incised wound. There was not much bleeding at that time. I examined the intestines, and found it was a large mass of the small intestines which protruded. In about 10 minutes I succeeded in returning the intestines. Deceased was alive at that time. I united the incision by sewing. Mr. Edwards then deposed to the treatment adopted by him for the preservation of Border's life, and finding that he was fast ssnking witness said, "Who on earth has done this?" and he replied, " Ton." He (witoess) had no doubt that the knife produced would have inflicted the wound in deceased's abd o. men, and he had no hesitation in saying that such wound produced death. The Inquest was then adjourned until next day, and a post mortem examination ordered to be made of each body.
