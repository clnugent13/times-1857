THE SLAVBVTRADE. TO THEE EDITOR OF TH TMES. Sir,-Having in former years imbibed the idea, from speeches made in Parliamient, and from articles in newspapers isimilar to that in your leader of the 24th, that our squadron on the West coast of Africa, so far from diminishing, rather increased the evils of the slave-trade, I went to Angola in 1854 fully expecting to find, as you remark, "that this nefarious traffic still subsists as much as ever. When, however, I came in contact with Portuguese who had actually been engaged in the trade, and heard them refer to it invariably in the past tense, my confidence was somewhat shaken in the soundness of Parliamentary information. " Such a man was rich," said they, " in the time of the slave-trade.' And when I saw boys of 10 or 12 years of age sold for about 12s. each within 150 miles of the coast, and heard the pathetic lamentation " Ah ! we could have got 60 or 70 dollars for these lads In the time of the slave-trade," together with the frank confession by those who, of all others, ought to know best that the prime agents in the repression of the trafflc were the English cruisers, I was forced to a different conclusion from that to which the really very plausible statements of various parties had led me. Theu, again, I saw crowds of carriers (carregadores) on the road from the interior to the coast. Tbese carriers are compelled by the Government of Ioanda to convey merchandise at the rate of 2d. a-day. On examining this system of compulsory labour I found it to be a direct evidence of the efficiency of our cruisers in repressing the slave trade. Thus, previous to 1845, when the squadron was increased to the strength it had before the breaking out of the Russian war, all the merchandise of ADgola was brought down to the coast by slaves. The merchants went inland with a few slaves bearing goods, and purchased ivory and beeswax with slaves sufficient to carry them. ARl were intended for exportation, and there was no more dlificulty in shipping the human cargo than the loads they carried. But on the augmentation of the force on the coast the Government resorted to this species of impreasment to supply the place of the slaves which were previously all exported. The spectacle of a large gang of slaves marched down to the coast, so common previously to 185, In now never seen; and if we glance at the Custom-house returns we find that the receipts for head money gradually diminished from that year till 1850, when none was received. This sacrifice of a large revenue by the Portuguese Government shows that we are not the only people who have made eforts to put down the odious traffic; and half the honesty of purpose whichyou civilly ascribe to the Governor of Cuba had characterlzed the officials sent to Angola the trade would have entirely ceased. A few incorrigible slavedealers, winked at by governors of Loanda who in words would outmatoh General Concha In strenuous endeavours to annihilate the traffic, have continued to export a few loads annually from certain ports north of Loanda. But this has been a difficult game to play, inasmuch as their own countrymen willingly give information to the cruisers for a small consideration, and being obliged to conceal their shipments from both parties they stand, as it were, between two fires. So far from brisk is the export trade that I once travelled in company with three native slavedealers who led eight womnen in a chain away from the coast towards the middle of the country to sell them for ivory. One of their owners said "that the English cruisers alone prevented their being sold across the sea." And as for the alleged increase of cruelty in the middle passage, any one who reads how slaves were treated when the slave-trade was legal will see that it was often even then as bad as it could be. It is of such a heathenish, or rather fiendish, nature that men engaged in it are somehow led to treat their fellow-men immeasurably wose than they would animals of equal or inferior value. Notwithstanding the very decided influence of the cruisers on the parts I visited, there seems to have been an increase in the traffic since the strength of the cruisers was reduced by the Russian war; a`nd this increase has taken place in the rivers north of Angola. The prostitution of the American flag is a serious drawback to our efforts at suppression.Yet it must be borne in mind that we hear more about it nowadays; and the increase of our knowledge of an abuse does not imply an actual augmentation of the evil. While cur attention is directed to feater numbers of slaves being imported into Cuba we must not shut our eyes to the fact of another market being closed altogether to the trade, nor forget that the present posture of Brazil is owing to the moral influence of Great Britain. Cuba would, were the trade open, take and kill off 50,000 slaves annually. About two-thirds are kept away from her shores by the present blockade. That, with another large market closed to the traffic, is surely not an ignoble failure. I have thus ventured to state my conviction in favour of oiur present system, formed, asit was, from personal observation, and in the teeth of a strong bias to the contrary, that you may, according to youlr custom, and if you should deem it advisable, give this to your readers by way of helping them to both aides of the question. It is not to ha supposed for a moment that the present system of coercion will result in a radical cure of the evil. The cultivation by the Africans on their own soil of the raw materials of our manufactures and the influence of Christian civilization alone will effect a permanent suppression of the slave-trade. But all hope of this must be given up if the coast tribes are to be hounded on by Europeans to hunt down the defenceless inland inhabitants on the absurd pretence of promoting " free emigration." It is no more true that Africans take delight in hunting, buying, and selling each other than that the English glory in hanging themselves in November. I know that this is the case throughout the interior, and I was sorry at the cause of a different state of things on the borders of civilization. But we are ignorant of the sources whence statements such as that referred to arise. From meeting it in various quarters, and more especially in the mouths of slaveholders, or wonld-be slave employers, I am inclined to think that both it and that about the inefficiency of Her Majesty's cruisershave had their origin in those who are, directly or indirectly, abettors of slavery, and that they are promulgated by many who, like myself, had not the means of testing their truth.

RAILWAY AND MIINm sHAREs. Tuesday Evening. The depression in the funds, together with the natural reaction upon the recent advance, have caused a general decline in railway shares; but the market continuea to wear a strong appearance. CaledoniaD, especially, receded, leaving off ]W per cent. lower. In other descriptions the fall was from i to A per cent. Colonial sorts were also weaker, and East Indian and Grand Trunk of Canada closed j per cent. below the last prices yesterday. French generally declined on the reCeiDt of lower quotations from Paris, and a reduction occurred in Great Luxembourg. There was a limited demand for American securities, but the late advance was steadily maintained. A fair amount of busines was transacted in mines, and no important alteration toak place. Joint-stock banI were firm; Australasia, which were as low as 80 yesterday, marked 84. City, Orliental, and Ottoman also improved. In miscellaneous securities the only variation was in South Australian Iand, which were nominally quoted higher. Coven 9bs% j, Lt d.

RAILWAY INTRLLTGENOE. .b _ GRE&A NORTHERN. The adjourned balf-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the London Tavern, MIr. E. Denison, A,p, in the chair. Mr. MowvATT, the Secretary, read the notice convening the meeting. Mr. HuoHEs wished to know whether, It was intended to use any of the proxies of the former meeting on that oocca sion, as the use of stch proxies by the chalrman would be decidedy illegaL They were only vailable for one meetin and if used on a second occaion the liability to a fine of for each would be incurred. The CHAutxA said the regular business of the meeting was to receive the report of the directors presented to the shareholders in August last as modified by the snppleinental report issued a few days before the present meeting, by which they woudd perceivethat there wO a sum of 1S3,2761 available for dividend after paying the. interest on deben. ture bonds. He then moved a formal resolution that the report, which had been in the hands of the shareholders for two or three months past, as modifid by the supplemental report recently issued, be receited and adopted. Mfr. Piciz, deputy-chairman, seconded the motion. kr. Hxn , being one of the preferepe shareholders who had taken an active part in advocating the rights of the preference shares, objected to'some of the paragraphs in the report; those of the supplemental report of the 26th of November -were inconststent with those in the dirtctrepo*r of the 21st of August last. There were several cndaou observations in the recent report. which ke would wish to see omitted. With regard to the report of the 21st of August it did not show the scheme for the dividend, in ac. cordanco with the requiremaents of the Companies Clase Consolidation Act. The scheme for the dividend should have been made up from the time the last dividend was d9clared, which was in Aiugust, 1856. It should have beea for a year instead of half a-year, ending 30th of June, 1857. She supplemental report ws wrong op that point, and he considered the tone of the latter report very objectionable. The sixth paragph iw- the report was very unfair towards the preference shareholders, by whose exertions the present result was brought about. He then entered into a justification of the eourse adopted by the preference shareholders, and contended that if the chairman were sincee in respect to his statement iu the 44sh paragraph of the directors' report of March last, he eould not possbly complain of the preference shareholder,. He then read the. 44th paragraph-" The directors cannot take u=n themselves to propose orsupport any biLl which woull tnw upon the preference stocks any portion of theIon sh question, and thereby shake the eonfidence of the public in all such socks." The excuse they bid given for adopting a contrary course was that Lord Redesdale objected to the original bill, the vote of the general meeting in March for appropriating the funds of the half-year and the opinion of their legal advisers, to the effect that all classes of shareholders should bear the los1. If the directors were sinoere in the promotion of the original Bill, which threw all the loss Gn the open shareholders, there was no reason why they should. impumt unfair conduct to the preference shaeholders. They hiA proposed that the losses should be spread over a series of years, bu the directors endeavoured to take the whole lOs3 out of one half-year, and so deprive the preference shae holders of their dividends; but they were defeated in that. They had shown them that a vote of the general meeting could not deprive preference shareholders of their righta Hethen proceeded to explain the progress of the Bill through Parliamuent, with a viewr to showv that the merits of the question wisth regard to taking away the rig,hts of the pret'erence shareholders had never come before the committee at all, and that when the questiOn came before the Houe of Lords clauses were inserted to protect them. He th adve-ted to the decision of Vice-Chancellor Wood establishing the rights of the ereference shareholders, an the subsequent confirmation that decision by the Lord Chancelor andthe Lords Justlces, This showed that a few shareholders having a good cause and right on theirside could defeat the directors of a powerful compaany, notwlthstnding that they were backed by unlimited funds. He hoped the shareholders generally would look closer into their affairs, and endeavour to elect o0casionallY a few good men of business, when vacandes occurred in the direction, to profinote theinterest of the company. (Cheers.) After a few words from Mr. BrrixNG, Mr. GruncsGc, and Mr. WxnEams, Mr. T. Wnso2T said he thought It would be desirable to know the amount of the legal expenses that had been incurred in the litigation with the prefehence shareholders, the amount of fees paid to counsel, and other particulars. He thought it nothing but reasonable that they should know how their affairs were conducted, and betreated with proper respect ofries "Question.") lar. v. A IGHT was auxious that a ittle oil should be thrown on the troubled waters The preference shareholders having gained their object, they had no reason to complain. The directors had, no doubt, endured a great deal of troub!e, and he hoped there would be an end of bickering. He trusted the directors would now be enabled to attend to the interests of the company and promote the traffic on the line. The public was much indebted to the exertions of Mr. Denison, and he should like him very well to continue their chairman if he were not so dictatorial, and had more consideration for the feelings of the shareholders. The CHAn2LLN, in reply, said he had no wish to act in a discourteous manner towards the shareholders, bnt he bad been proToked to it He was very sorry if he had given any offence (cheers), but he must ask them to bear with him a little. He had been provoked a good deal, and he was quito wldling to forget everything, if they wvould forget everything that was past. He never intended to insult any man or to behave discourteously to him. (Cheers.) Tha report was then carried. The CE3mNu then moved a formal resolution to the effect, that a dividend from the 1st of July, 1856, to the 1st of July, 1857, be declared on all the preference shares at the various rates of dividend in full on the several preference stocks; and thst a dividend of 6s. per cent, be declared on the ordmiarT stock, and of 12M. per oent, on the B. stock, towards the SIx per cent. for 1857. These were the resolutions which he would put to the meeting. He proposed that the dividends on the preference stocks should be paid in full, in accordance with Vice-Chancellor Wood's decree, which had been subsequently confirmed by the Lord Chancellor. He could say that his coleaes, so soon as they were justfied by the late decision, proceeded at once to take steps for paing them in fulL The directors had felt ittheir duty to appeal fromtheflrstdecision, but sosoon as it was confirmed they were ready to pay the preference shareholders in fulL He could safely say that neither the directors nor himself grudged It to the parties. He felt in his conscience they had no alternative, with regard to this matter, than the course they had adopted. They had endeavoured to carry out the resolution of the meeting of shareholders, and as they had done what they could the preference shareholders were welcome to their victory. Mr. V. HNIGnT seconded the resolution for the declaration of the dividend, and it was carried. Mr. GBETNG then proceeded to move a vote of censure on the dictors, In respect o the reg itration department. of which he had given notice. He contended, that if proper care had been taken by the secretary and directors, the frauds of Redpath would have been discovered at an early period. For the half-year ending 31st of December, 1853, 1L5001. had been overpaid bydividend warrants, whichrepresented an increase of capital to the amount of 60,0001. The matter had been brought to the notice of the secretary, aud by him to that of the directors. (Great uproar.) The CQm IRs.N interposed more than once to obtain a hearing for Ir. Greening. Mr. GRIENG said, that on the 31st of December the A. stock was 39,5001. more than the B stock, which might have been discovered if a proper mode of account had been kept. In Febrnr, 1856, the chairman very quietly affixed the seal to the register, and stated merely that some inaccuracies had crept into the account, but it would be inquired into. In the following Augnst he told them he did not be. lleve they had a dishonest man in their employment, from the secretary to the porter. From the February to the following September Redpath hd increased the stock by 29,1501, although the directors were in possession of the fast that there was something wrong. He concluded by moving the followving resolution:- 'That the dictossIoffice beore the 12th of Msuch lat be au are hereby cenued for tleir long mismnagement or neglect of the registration department, by whlch L kedpath during many ears waw ensabledto ODmmit fruds which bad caused enormous loess to the oom. pany." Mr. HuGnZSa seconded the motion. He sad it had beon attempted by Mr. Greening to fix the directors with the responsibility of the loss. (Laughter.) He (Mr. Hughes) wished he could fix it on the chearman, for every one knew the whole affirs of the company were managed by him, aud the directors had but little to do with them. (Uproar.) With the exception of Mr. Alderman Meek they had all assented to involving the preference shares in the loRs Endeavours had been made to throw the responsibility and blAme on Mr. Clark, the former registrar, on Mr. Reynolds. the accountant, and on their respected secretary. Ee did not think the auditors had done their duty. He had obiected on a former occasion to the way in which the accounts had been kept, and he now protested against the use of proxies. (Cheers.) Mr. ScoT'r believed the whole fault lay inthe secretary's department, no account being kept of the large number of dividend warrants signed by him. He moved an amend. ment at-ributing gross negligence to the secretary in respect to the signature of dividend warrants, and a want of con- ndence. Mr. FEixrNG explained that the secretary bad done everything in his power to detect the errors in the accounts, but he was for some time baffled in his inquiries bv Red. path and others, and so soon as he had something tangible e communicated the fact to the chairman. There were 6,000 warrants to sign, and they had to be prepared in a fortnight; 15 or 16 clerks were at work night and day to got them out. It was a physical impossibility for the secretry to hae examined every one of them. He thought some middle ^ourse might be adopted. Mr. Serjeant WELrs, in a very energetic speech, defended the dircotors, and called unon the shareholders to pause before they resigned their )I,OW,00O4 worth of property to the managemen,t of railwvay reformers or pro. fessional agitators. MIr. WAvxi complained of the obaervationsin Mir. DeLison's statement on the report of the committee; they were very unfair, and he considered the chief losses of the com. pany arose from want of efficiency in the secretary's departmaent. Mr. MOWATT said it was untrue; it was a gross falsehood. The CAiRm said the committee had not stated the whole in their report; they had kept things back which they ought to have stated. He (the chairman) did not write the answer to it, although he signed it. Mr. Wrnrus said, it %ppeared the great object was to find a victim. One gentleman said the directors were entirely to blame, another gentleman said he would make tho chairman responsible for all and another gentleman said the secretary was at fault. Thb cbUiman and directors said Mr. Clark, the former registrar, was to blame; then others, again, wished to rmako a victim of the committee. Others, again, thought the auditors .shonb4 bave disoovered those frauds. (Laughter.) The law. more wise than either, bad selected Redpath, and transpopfd bim. Thet, should be satisfied with the trausportation of the real oMme, Theae w-Naa AV lason wrhy tbey Aoi.l sacrifico their property asy further In respoct of tjhUtmatt4i Bethought some blame might attach to the ahareholder4 especially tbe A shbareholders, for not looking oloser afet their interests. He thought the haudsome apology of tho cbairman shoald have some weight witI them. No one vwshed to impugn his honour, or that of the directors. They sbould allow annryexpresslons to slink into oblivion--e. look forward to the fature. They had psid their prefeienc shareholdera ia full, and siould make the best of whit sbey had left. The question of the preferenco shares h%& been settled by the highest authoritr, and it th directors had acted without that authorty thematter would bavebeea open to litigation. and some might have songhtto.

Their dividends wouldincrease their revena was now far above the average gf other rallways, and he. thovsght they might give their drectors a further trial, foe. getting the past. (Cheers.) The CnAIRMLtY then replied at oonsiderable length, eon. tending that the directors had dono evervthng in their power to nrotect the interests of the shareholders. They had placed Mr. Clark. avery resrectable man, over tho re. gistration department, And paid him GM. A-year for hi services; and in the couroe of bsiness he had certified frozn time to time as to the correctness of the accounts - the registrar had trnsted too nuch to Riedpth, an4 it had been found thast .21,0004 of stock had bbeem forged by Redpath during the time the former registrawas in office. He endeavoured to show that Mr. Gree'It bad given.notioe of his motion before he knew the facts ot the case. He had endeavoured to beoocue a director of the Great Northern Company, but was not elected. It was all nonsens to attribute bbme to M. Iowatt, because he believed it was imposeible to get a better s-ecretary. The Chairman then described the course he took the moment he. heard of the discrepancies in the acoounta, wbich areslllin the arrest and oonvicUon of Redpath. Instead of a voW of censure the directors and secretary deserved a vote of thanks for what they had done. Bat he (the Chairman) dia not-van tei tans.Heasked M1r. Btt to withaw~ his amendment. (Cries of ," Withdraw.") Mr. Scorr then withdreaw his amendment. On Mr. Greening's motion being put there appeared 20 a; favour of it, and a large number Against it. The motlom. was consequently negatived. The meeting wAs then made special. Ur.

The CmanM" said the directors would resist the claini Three members of the committee had made the report with.. out consulting the two directors who were also appoinoea rneinbers of the committee by the sheholders. Mr. Hth TH defended the claim of the oommittee, andu said they could enforce It if refused. Mr. MALiNs, one of the committee, stated that they lhad saved the companua considerable sum by thei interfereno the companay was Ing ptst to an expense of 18,0001. for ait investigation of their accunts which was useless, and the committee had stopped it. The object of nen.papyona seemedl to be intended to prevent any committee in future.

ExRmORn:iAy Imh osvTurj.-At the adjournesessions at Stafford on Thursday an old man, named Thomas Beardmore, alias John Mlobley, aged 63 years, pleade(1 'guilty to two charges of obtaining monoy and goods nnder false pretences at Leek and Stone. The crcumstances under which the frauds were practised are so extraordinary that we give a brief outline of the facts, as they would havebeen more fully disclosed if the charges had been iavesti. tead by a jury. The prisoner, whose real name is Johm Vobley, is a native of Weston Turvil, near Aylesbury. Porsome time he has resorted to a series of impostures, his fa. vourite character being that of a returned convict, and inthat personation he was described in the Police GaxcUe of Sep. teuber 2 as having imposed upon an old woman named Hannah Duckworth, near Burnley, Lancashire, by repre. senting himself as her son. At a later date, at Leelc Staffordshire, he represented himsef to be a man namtd Frederick Cox, who had been transported about 19 years previosly. In consequence of the plausible tale he told. and his accurate knowledge of events 'which had tranaplre. before Coe's transportation, he was kept for nearly a montkx at the house of a married daughter of the oonvict. Cox,, wie, supposiDg her husband to have been ded, isd hagTd* again, and, although it is scarcely credible, the illy woma,n was so completely oonvinced that the prisoner was her long. nmssing partner, that sho left the man whom slie h mar ried and lived with the prisoues as his wife.

TRX CAPTUBE Off DELHI. TO THE EDITOE OF THE TIMES. DELHI, SEPT. 26. 'Sir,-tevolvers and swords have now. become salsiar to ciivilans in Inadi and, girding them on wrhen we reeeived the news of the occupation of 3)elhi, I found rmy way across country and came ia -'with tho vultures to have a look at the caroase of the reconquered city, and find my way forward -with the advancing troops. I .-6und the greater Tart of the victorious army in the city, and the waunde I, &c., being moved into it from camp, -ma I satisfied myself with the spectacle of dead '0odies, and breaches, and the localities of the combat, of all of which you will, I fancy, have pretty lull particulars from other correspondents. I think thowe who called the fortificationw of Delhi a garden'wall have only to walk round them to be satisfied -of their mistake. The defences are exceedingly strong, and though the heights, a mile distant, facilitate a siege, they by no;means, for practical DuraPovee, give any real command of the place. I am told on very competent authority that, from . mere artillery point of view, the place is stronger than Bburtpore ever was; and yet it proves that sour main difficulty was inside, not outhide Delhi. The Sepoys permitted our heavy batteries to be approached with comparatively little oppositionbreaches were speedily and well effected, and our troops got over them with loss, but without serious -check. But there their task was by no means accomplished, and street by street the enemy contested every foot of ground and occupied position after position with a courage and deterfmination worthy of a better cause. In fact, we may well ,congratulate our6elves that we did not attempt the ztorm with an inferior force. There is no doubt tbat on our occupation of a part of the city our army became disorganized to a degree which was highly dangerous when the battle was but half -won. W'hether the collection in the part of the town which we first assaulted of vast quantities of 'wine and spirits (the produce of the plunder of a long line of road on which those articles. are the main staple of European commerce) -vas really the result of deep strategy on the part of the mutineers, I cannot say, but it oes seem as if the only common bcnd which unites the various races 'lighting under our stand;ard is a common love of liquor, and Europeans, Sikhs, Goorkhas, and Afighans are said to have all mndulged to an extent which might have been -dibastious. In truth, the days which followed the :first assault were a time of great anxiety. Our progreFs was slow; the number of men -whom we could bring into qction curiously small. and the aban-4onment of the positions held by the enemy was, I believe, a relief to the Generals, even though we did %ot exterminate the mutineers. In fact, I believe 'that the bridge of boats was purposely left intact by our batteries; we were well content to leave a bridge to a flying enemy. I do not think that the enemy were actiually forced out by our shells. I 'was surprised to find how little damage was done by them. The wa]]s of the Palace are almost intact; so are by far the greater portion of the buildings inside, and it is quite clear that the chances were yet very auch in favour of such as chose quietly to sit in them. In fact, I fancy that our mortar batteries were by no means very strong, and not suflicient to do effectially such extensive work; but both the ;epoys and the King's party had had enough of it. 5he fire was, no doubt, hot, and was becoming more fo,-so they retreated, carrying with them most of their valuables, but leaving all the heavy guns and other bulky articles. As to purnuit, the infantry was simply completely knocked up and unfit to pursue for a single mile, and the General would not risk the mounted branch alone, so he contented himiself with securing his conquest, and the city of Delbi is completely ours. For the rest, a small party of Irregular cavalry appearing at a place a few miles off, where the King's family -had taken refuge, obtained wossessioii of the pereons of the Kling and the more important lrinces, making prisoner the former, killing the latter. Our position is quite secure, but we bave yet taken no vossession for a single mile south of the city. Only on the east a force is now moving out to the bridge on the Hindun, and will proceed to clear and occupy the Doab. For the taking of Delbi I believe that Genelul -ilaon, blow, cautious, calculating, and, purely an artilery officer, has been the right man in the right place, and that we have been very fortunate in him. Ee is neither a square man nor around man, but a very peculiar man, who has found his place in the very peculiar situation before Delhi and, amid much to perplex, has very steadily held his cautious course till by a favouring Providence-having meantime averted all the possible and probable contretemps which might have prevented the issue,-he has at last triumphed. But, Delhi taken, I believe that his 3partis played. GeneralWilson seems tohave beenborn to take Delhi, and he has taken Delhi; so let us be thankful. All accounts concur in representing the Sepoys as having fled in much greater disorganization than could well have been calculated on, seeing the good fight they made and the absence of purault. There is no sign whatever of their having mnade a halt or a stand anywhere within several marches of Delhi, and I believe that they really have gone off in a much demoralized state, and taking 'with them only a few light guns and their most' valuable plunder. Some have gone down or across the Doab, and some down the right bank of the Jnmna. That is all we yet know. Delhi has been completely emptied of its population and thoroughly gutted. The rows of empty houses and scattered emarins of property present a strange spectacle. But the scenes of the devastated city, and strange, wild, discordant-looking camp in and about the Palace, I leave it to other hands to portray. I will only say I believe that in all the history of this world of ours there is nothing that in any degree approacbes the most strange spectacle of -Sikhs and AAlhans-whose country wve so lately and with so much bloodshed occupied with armies of Bindostanees-now under our banners sitting bloody and plunder-laden in the Palace of the :Moguls. Yet these men are by far the most conspicuous occupants of Delhi, and to them we chiefly, in the exhausted state of our European troops, look to enable us to reoccupy our lost provinces of lHindostan. They have served us so far with the most complete fidelity. In the course of the siege they have been indispensable to us, and in the assault they behaved as well as could be expected from somewhat raw and irregular troops. I refer to oxur own regiments. Gholab Singh's auxiliaries were beaten back and ran away, and are much abused in consequence. But my own stronpg impression is that a great deal too .much was required of them-that is, more than they were likely to perform. They were set to storm a 'very strong position defended by a battery of very heavy guns-the last thing native troops are likely to do. But they have altogether borne much less of the heat of the day (in many cases they have comparatively recently arrived), and they are consequently in far better case than the European regiments. In their drinking and plundering propensities and somewhat impaired discipline they hardly differ fro7n the huropeans, whom they allege to be their mode.a in these particulars; at least, it is a difference of degree. I believe that the immediate enect of the taking of Delhi, provided the local disturbances in the Lower Punjab do not prove more serious than we n`low suppose, will be to quite secure the Punjab and our rear (where, all along, the fate of Delhi lmdecided, it has been impossible not to feel that any day an explosion might be most fatal); to give us posseesion of the districts about Delhi and of the Doab-at least as far as Agra, and I hope all tbe way down to Cawnpore; to open our communications with the lower provinces and forces there; to secure the native Princes of Rajpootana, and the Sikh and Hill States, and to act favourably on all the native States of India. For the rest, the most important point -to which I think ouxr eyes must be turned is *Owalior and the country thereabouts. The position of the Maharajah is already diffilcult .and will be much more so if many of the regisnents and fugitives from Delhi join the muti- mlous contingent and other troops now at GwaliorI So long as G walior continues in that Etate a spectacle remains which must still do muich to lnsettle the minds of the native Statis of Central India and our own Bombay and Mfadras armies. If we could only relieve the Maharajah and put him in effective possession of his own territory, and clear of the mutiny the long strip of British territory lying between the right bank of the Jumna and several other native States, I think we could hold the 3)oab and throw the mutiny altogether beyond the Ganges; in which case I should consider Tndia to bo gecured, and the conhuest of the autineers in. the Transgangetic country peculiarly their own to be a mere matter of time and expense, and one for which we oould afford to wait the arrival of the most tardy suceours from England, which, *in spite of the best efforts5 of English statesmen, must surely begin to arrive in those pleasant old sailing ships, dcep with heavy merchandise, some time in the next 12 montbs. But what between the want of generals and the want of troops, it is, I fear, very doubtful whether the Delhi army will effect the whole of the primary objects I have mentioned without EDglibh aid; and it yet may be that the delay in furnishing that aid may involve a continued werious risk to the empire for some months to come. Ta'ken as Delhi at last is, the fact will no doubt be in some degree a relief and support to those who have all along pooh-poohed the danger; but I do still most seriously maintain, not as a mere figure of speech but in sober earnestness, that the successful termination of the siege has been in spite of very umfavourable chances; that if we were to begin again under similaf circumstances, the chances are three to one we should fail; that, failing, all the Europeans in Eorthern India must have been extermiated, and our rule and name utterly obliterated from thence, and then every native state in India must have thrown off our yoke. Tbrough Rajpootana, Central India, and the Nizam's country the same must inevitably have rUn, and then who ,hall say whether we could have held the maritime provinces of Bengal, Madras,} and Bombay, and reconquered India ? It must be remembered that to take Delh'i we have been obliged, besides, completely abandoning the whole of the North-WeseternProvincea and all thenativeStates adjacent to them, entirely, we may say, ,to denude tlhe Punjab and Scinde, and to put arms into the hands of every Sikh and zffghan soldier we could find. lt has been necestary to keep our army exposed, witbhout any coverwhatever beyond very'scanty canvass. for the four hottest and worst months of the hottest part of the hottest country in the world, and to e- camp them on. a most pestilential spot. Duringal thowe months our troops have been continually defendingthemselvesin anundefendedexposedpositlo4, against a vasitly superior, never-tiring enemy-and there has been exacted from our soldiers an amount of hard labour and exposure which it was hitherto altogether incredible to us that any European fralie could stand in such a climate. I cannot see that there was any fair opportunity of taking the place sooner than we did. And to enable us to hold out during these four months who could have calculated on so unprecedentedly, I say advisedly-quite unprecedentedly-favourable a season ? Who could have calculated on so extraordinary an absence of sickness? Who *would have dared to be confident of the constant fidelity oF all Sikhs and Affghans during so prolonged a period-our power frustrated, our only torce so long checked before Deli,aand theircountry, in fact, altogether intrusted to their owFn keeping, together writh the army hitherto used to keep them in subjection nowr either rebels or prisoners in their hands I believe that when a force first marched to Delhi there was hardly one man in India who did not believe we must take it in a month, or our Empire was gone. We did not take it, and that our empire did not go is only due to good fortune and a successful management of the Punjab territories far beyond any expectation. What then might have been, and may be, the importance of the troops which might have arrived at Bombay, IRurrachee, and Calcutta in August and September? As it i? it will only be bythe lucky accident ofthatmuch dirputed China Expedition that we may save Lucknowv and have been able to maintain garrisons in Allahabad and Benares, and that we may yetkeep things going till the anCient galleys arrive to our rescue; for the best part of the army of Delhi has been, in fact, used up in the siege. The present state of that army is this. The European infantry and Foot Artillery, and the Only native regiment which may claim somo equality with them (Reid's Goorkhas), are completely used up and exhausted. There is, for campaigning purposes, to all intents, an end of them for the present. At most, they can only garrison Delhi and a few places in the neighbourhood. The regiments do not average 250 strong. The whole army of Delhi could not turn out 1,500 European bayonets, and those who can turn out are so haggard and enfeebled by constant work and exposure that to expect of them serious work or much marching is out of the question. In fact, they must be n;ursed into health and strength. If the siege of Delhi had lasted another fortnight it really seems as if the European army must have gone out of itself. I am not sure of the exact number of the native infantry in camp, but think that they may m uster 2,500 or from that to 3,000 bayonets of Punjahees and Goorkhas, exclusive of Goolab Singh's Contingent. The latter think they have done enough, and cannot be calculated on for much further service. The efficiency of our own native regiments is cruelly diminished by the prodigiously large proportion of loss among their Eu ropean officers. In fact, hardly any remain, and they are commanded by new young men who knaw nothing of them and their peculiarities. So much for the Foot. But as regards the mounted branch we are much better off. The cavalry have bad little to do, and are in remarkably fine condition. There are, I think, some 2,000 of them, including a very fine European regiment-the 9th Lancers-and detachments of another-the Carbineers-which having brought to India recruits unable to ride, and European ideas of clothing, &c., are as yet but half a regiment. The rest of the eavalry are almost entirely Punjab horse-all the Punjabees of several of Sir J. iawrence's local and police regiments, the Guides, and a new corps raibed by that very gallant officer Captain Hodson, and composed more than anything we have hitherto had of the old sirdars and soldiers of Runjeet Singh's time-in consequence of which, and of the skill of their commander, they are already an extremely eflicient corps. I was talking this morning to a very independent-looking aBesaldar, who seemned to be treated by his men 'much more as they do a European officer than is ever seen in our service, and who bears himself as the inferior of no one, and I found that he had been long a colonel of artillery in Runjeet Sing's service, and very openly went through the part he had taken against us in the revolt of 1849 in that capacity. The field artillery is very strong; there are at least six or seven troops and horse batteries, besides the Foot Artillery, which is hardly in a condition to move. Though the men of the mounted artillery have been partially worked in the batteries, the horses are quite fresh, and the men are well equal to their work. As matters have turned out, I hope it may prove that Delhi has been taken at the right time. It is certain that it was not taken a day too early, and that a little more delay in a Delhi September, worl, climate, and the prospect of reinforcements to the enemy from Mhow and Gwalior all telling against us, would probably have been fatal. But Providence having so markedly favoured us In preserving us before Delhi so long, it may, in fact, boe well that the body of the Northern mutineers has remained there so long, that they did not march back to overwhelm Cawnpore a second time, and I Lucknow, and other places long before, the arrival of reinforcements there, and before the approach of tbe Season favourable for European troops and when Englis,h regiments may be expected. Great, indeed, will be our " Ikbal" it it has all turned out for the best. Many papers were found in the Palace at Delhi (even the natives have retained our partiality for paper work), and from them it would appear that the kind of government established for the city and immediately surrounding country was more of the nature of a military than of a Mahomedan government. It seems to have been ascrt of constitutionalmonarobical milocracy. The King was King, and honoured as such like a constitutional monarch; but, instead of a Parliament, he had a Council of soldiers, in whom ieow er rested, and of whom he was in no aegree a miliTary commander. No Arabic or Persian names, forms, or terms appear to have been introduced; but, on the contrary, the English terms and modes of business were generally adopted. The extent to which English terms are used sounds very absurd. All petitions seem to have been presented to the King, but the great authority to which almost all of them on all matters both civil and military were referred (by order endorsed on the petition) was the " Court,"-a body composed of a number of Colonels, a Brigade-Major, and " Seketuri' (or Secretary), which latter functionary seems to have been the most important personage in Delhi. AU the colonels, &e., -were Sepoys who made their mark, or, at beat> sisgned in rough Hindoo characters. Very regula; xnusber rolls of regimentawere kept u and autsanticated iin due form by the, colonel, a4i nS tant, atl quarter7 ter. From these docueneet s it alsec appears thaw liey wenat sO far into detail a' tto fill up the places of the Earopean-" sergeant-majors" and "quartermaster-sergeantt." I had not time to study the various papers, but I imagine that a verv intere3ting, useful; and amusing selection of the-m might'be picked out for i publication. One Sepoy Colonel seems to have presented to the King a kind of memorandum on the best mode-of administering the country after getting rid of the Feringhees. First aud foremost, he ad Vises His MIajesty to collect as much money as he can from any quarter, by any means wbatever, as a capital to start upon. Second, he says that there is no doubt that, with all the faults of the English, their Government was the best Hindoetan has ever seen, and he proposes that the future administration should be based on their model; 'and then, in many headings, he goes into details evincing considerable thought and shrewdness. There is, I. believe, among the papers a very long and enthusia3tic account of the destruction of the European garrion of Futt4hghur. I have in my pocket a petition from a man who sought to be ppointed collector of the district in rear of our army on a solemn pledge that he would collect the revenue and stop the supplies of the Europeans, or, if not, would submit to be blown from a gun ; but the prudent order is "to be considered when the hill (the. British position) is taken !" There are many communications from native Princes, who either promise or temporize much. .From all I can hear and gather, especially from the papers in the Palace, and from the conduct of the mutineers, particularly at Bareilly, in taking the titles of their officers, imitating their staffs, riding in their carriages, and appropriating their tents and equipages, I am more and more Inclined to infer that whatever there may have been of Mahomedan conspiracy, Hindoo religibus panic, and military or political apprehension, one of the main, if not the mnain object of the mutiny, either in its origin or in its spread, was the very simple and not unnatural one-a desire on the part of the inauential Sepoys to step into the shoes of their European officers. They liked our sysem altogether, but they preferred being colonels and adjutants to being havildars and naiks; and, with the usual selfsufficiency of natives, they imagined that they would make very good colonels and adjutants, and Jumped at the opportunity of effecting that object and more besides by transferring their allegiance and the whole army, with its old organization, to a native sovereign, the first who came to hand. Though the Mahomedan element did not prevail in Delhi, and there was for a long time no extensive rise en masse of the Mahomedan popiilation, Mahomedan adriinistrations have sprung up in some of the provinces abandoned by the Sepoys; but I do not know that they have generally got the better of the Hindoos and obtained possession of anythinlg like whole districts. Onthe contrary they are almost everywhere opposed. In the territories over which we retain some partial hold there have been latterly one or two purely Mdahomedan risings, quite distinct from mere gimeutes of plunderers; but I am not sure that some of these may not possibly have been in some degree provoked by our hostility to Mahomedans, and I still do not think that there has been a general revolt of the Mahomedan population. Their hearts are, no doubt, in great measure with a Mahomedan sovereign; but while many have gone over many more have remained neutral, and some have remained faithful. Taken altogether, our prospects, so far as we here know them, are now, I think, very good. I trust that we have turned the corner, and may proceed to the work of recovering the country. Months of anarchy have no doubt created many difficulties, but we shall get over them -at least we trust so, if the next news from below is good. That things should have been so much thrown back by the long-delayed outbreak in Bengal is much to be lamented, and we cannot but believe that half the energy which saved the Punjab from so large a Sepoy army might have saved Bengal, happy in so few regiments; but we trust that that is over, and that if General Hlavelock has the better of it at Lucknow the communications will now be opened, and Sir Colin Campbell will have at his disposal the nucleus of an army fit for the work yet before it. The army of Delhi will supply cavalry and horse artiUery; our ships must do the rest. The ehief difficulty wiiU be to supply to the civil power a fitting force to hold our districts as we recover them, disorganized and demoralized as they have been by the mutiny; and in their own country theSepoys may possiblyyetofer a very stubborn resistance before we can exterminate them. Desperate men, we may drive them from position to position, but when will it end? They can never submit-they can always outmarch us, and how soon and at how great cost shall we kill'them all The other serious danger is, lest our present violent feeling against the Mahomedans should drive to despair that great sectiont of the population, and induce a really general Mahomedan revolt as dangerous as the great mutiny. We must trust to the vigour and discretion of Government to avert that danger. B13t our great difficulty in this part of India at present is the total want of any head, civil or military, and of leading men in high office. Sir J. Lawrence's authority is directed to the Punjab, and it is wonderful how fatal these anxious months have been to the heads of affairs i the disturbed country. The Commander-in-Chief was folowed tohis grave by the commander of the field force. Disease and anxiety have carried off the strong frame and powerful intellect of JohnColvin, the Lieutenant-Governor; and where is the man to replace him ? But a few days after his death, on the verv day that we obtained possession of Delhi, the oivil and political officer there was suddenly carried off by cholera at the very moment when his real functions commenced; and the General commanding, himself a man who most strongly repudiates all fitness to enter into civil and political questions, ileft without a civil authority to co-operate with him, while there is no Governor to appoint anlother. Then,as to Generals; all the good officers of the second rank are dead and disabled. Chamberlain and Showvers, no doubt good men, have been severely wounded, and are still unequal to very active service; Nichoson, who seems to have been quite the best and the most successful, is a fearful loss, not only generally as an energetic commander, but especilly as a commander of Punjab troops-a man who thoroughly understood them, and wascapable of maintainiDg their discipline with an iron hand, and of keeping down that disposition to excess and disorder which can hardly fail to zesult from their present situation. There is much fear of their being spol7t. The consequence of the absence of heads, civil and militaty, is a singular want of unity of action. The General at Meerut is senior to the General at Delhi. Though distant, General Gowan exercises a nominal seniority over all; it is hardly felt. Every eommander at each different place is nearly independent of every one else, and no common plan can be settled. Nearly so is it in civil matters. The civil servants at Meerut are independent of those at Delhi; all those of the Delhi division are independent of one another, and some emigrant officials are a kind of free lances, going wherever they choose. The interrupted communications, abnormal state of all things; and summary forms of procedure have considerably relaxed all discinline and subordination, and left every man pretty^free to do as he chooses. BOLU2DSHUHUR, Ocr. L I was prevented by the excitement of grapeshot (tbat somewhat mixed and doubtful pleasure) from finishing and despatching my letter on the day I intended. I took my passagG down eountry with the brigade or moveable column which was leaving Delhii, being a part of the force included in my former enumeration. The folowing portion of the army has been senit forwardc:-About 450 European and 1,100 Native Panjabee, say 1,600 Infantry; about 900 Cavalry, of whem the 9th Lancers are about 370 strong, the rest Punjab Cavalry; two troops and one hore battery of Artillery, 16 gans, and some Sappers. Altogether a very good force. But a large proportion of the European Infantry went into hospital in the first two days, and they are evidently quite unnequal to active service. The rest of the fore are all right. For the first three marches nothing particular occurreci, with the exception of the burning of a notorie,us Goojar town. The fourth march wvas to bring us to the stronghold of the notorious rebel Naw ab Maludad, of Malaghur, a connexion of the Kir ig of Delhi, vho, on the strength of a mud fort as d some little old guns, the reward of his grand£' athera good service to us in former days, had set himself up in this part of the country, and had never been attacked by us, though worsted by a I Jat village in his neighbourhood. He had latterly beenjoined by the Jhansi brigade of mutineers, the 12thNative Inifantry, the 14th Irregular Cavalry, and three 9-pounder guns, for the mutineers ieem to atickl together in brigades according totla place or part of the country where they mutinied. Latterly, also, the brother of the .Nana of Cawnpore had joined with somufoJlowers. The brigade occupied the neighbouring town of Boolundshuhur, but we did not believe that they-. would have the temerity to 'oppose our greatly superior force. WYon''we approached Boolundshuhur we learnt, however, from villagers that they. were still there, posted outside, the town, with the 'three guns in position down the road, and coming up vith the advanced piclket we had a good look at them before our guns. arrived. I never was in a regular action before, and know not the poians by which to judge artillery matters, bat I certaiily wis astonished to find, as we got gun after gun into action, till at last we had 12 or 13 to their three, bow very well.the mutineers fought their guns. In truth, it may seem strange, but it is certainlv the case that, while we somehow or other never seemed to hit their guns, and fired away endless rounds for a very long time without producing any visible effect, they very speedily managed to disable one of our guns and a waggon, poured in a very hot fire of grape, and kdlled and wounded a number of our men and horses. It was only after' aintainlng a most stubborn fight for a very long time that they withdrew.two of their guns ind. retreated, leaving one gun and five dead Sepoys in and about the bat. tery; It was, I believe, an accident, but certainly the result has been very miuch to raiie my idea of the way they can fight; and it does make one reflect how great may be the resistance which they may offer in fights of this kind here and there about the country. Though their guns happened to escape. our fire, It was evident from the ntarks on the trees and on a building in their rear that the fire of round shot on their position must have -been terrific, and such as one could hardly believe even Eluropeants would have stood agdinst. The fact is our inafnt7 should have gone in almost at once. When they yielded our cavalry and infantry presed on. The Lancers were a good deal punished in the town, but a great many Sepoys were cut off, found in houses and kllled. The cavalry also killed some of the horsemen fighting them on either flank, and so they were driven out of the town with cofisiderable loss, and leaving a good deal of plunder behind theni, vwile we lost in killed and wounded 47 men and 40 horse. We have thus at last recovered one district station beyond Delhi, and, as we believe, with the station the district; so we trust that the tide has turned, and that the rest will follow. We hope that we shall not meet with opposition difficult to overcome from any portion of the fugitives from Delhi as we proceed down the Doab. I fear, however, that we shall not be able to reoccupy the Doab districts of the Agra division without detaching a great portion of our present force, and that the assistance we can render to the forces below must be confined to some mounted troops. In infantry we are ourselves very weak, and the European nucleus of that arm is not only physically but morally deteriorated by their prodigious laborar and losses. Let it not thenx be supposed that it is possible to relax any effort. A greatwork lies before E3ngland. Anglo-India has nobly done her part-the mother country must do. the rest. To regulate the conduct of our functionaries, civil and military, in the territory which we recover, to introduce again tome centralization of system and uniformity of principle and practice, to punish with a vigorous hand the guilty, to shield the innocent,- to guard against the effects of prejudice or passion, to prevent unfair or inexpedient' persecution of any section of the population, or indiscriminate plunder of those who are still our subjects, to reorganiza government and render possible peace,-all this will, indeed, reqtuire a master hand, guided by a master mind. God grant us the man for the place. In trLuth, as yet we must feel that it too much depends on each individual offlcer, and the natural exasperation on our part is so great that to many men comsparatively igunorant of the country, who must necessarily exercise great power, it must be very difficult to distingtush between the movers and the victims of the rebellion. Especially, it may not be always borne In mind that, throughout, the rising has been in every sense most emphatically a military mutiny in its outbreak, little shared in by the mass of the people. Civil anarchy has been but the consequence and civil rebellions the enisodes of the great military outbreak. God forbid that the guily should be spared; on the contrary, to put down the rebellion they must be pursued with a system and success such as we have not yet seen. Again and again I say, -we must exercise the most unflinching severity; disagreeable as it may be, it is quite necessary. But, if the country is to be ours and the natives our subjects, it is at least as necessary that we discriminate and take care that, because for the time we fail to catch the guilty, we do not punish the innocent instead.* CAMP OF THE MOVEABLE COLUMIT SO-UT- EAST OF AGRA, OcT. 16. I don't think I have ever mentioned a notable and somewhat absurd feature of the rebellion-the electric guns; but they are so continually before me that I must disbtarden my mind of them. To preserve the electric telegraph posts they were inserted in enormous iron screws, into the hollow of which the poles were ineerted. It struck some ingenious native to make these into cannon. A hole was drilled near the apex, sometimes some Iron bands were put round to increase the strength, the piece was then mounted on a small gun carriage made for the purpose, and the result was a " tope"-that great instrument of terror to the minds of natives. The plan has met with vast favour, and these guns swarm all over the country. There is no end to the number of cannon now said to'be in every one's hands. They are loaded with a rough grape, and are certainly fired. Whether they ever do any execution I cannot say; they sometimes burst, but also they are certainly sometimes fired without bursting. I believe the effect is principally moral, but it is a very ridiculous perversion of ottrmosbt recent progress. To return to our history. On the 5th we occupied another district station, Allyghur, where a party of fanatie Mahomedaus had the temerity to make a stand with two real guns of native manufacttre, and a park of electric guns. They were dispersed in a few minutes, when the Horse Artillery gaUoped up, and very many fugitives were out up by the Cavalry. Next morning the Irregular Cavalry made a raid on the head-quarters of two rebel Thakoors, caught them in the act of decamping, and cut them up with their followers; after which their town was given up to fire and plunder. So the district of Allyghur was pretty nearly recovered. Meantime the main body of the beaten mutinous army fromiDelhi, which had made some stay at Muttra and set up a bridge of boats there, had crossed into the Doab, and, consequent on the delay in our progress, we foundthat they were here two long marches ahead of us. They had 22 guns; but (as we are told) very little ammunition and a vast quantity of plunder. They were in a very confused and undisciplined state, though their numbers were undoubtedly very large. They were understood to be going, part of them to Bareilly and part into Oude-to Lucknow and Cawnpore, they said. They showed nodisposition whatever to fight us ; on the contrary, the direct road to Bareily was given up, ancd they hurried down the Grand Trunk Roaad in a body. There remained of the regniments which retreated from Delhi only the Neemuch Brigade (which had formerly attacked Agra). These, under one Beera Singh, declined to join the others, and they marched to meet the Mhow Brigade, which had never been at Delhi, but, after some &tay at Gwalior, had separated from the Gwalior Contingent and crossed the Chumbul to Dholpore, where they had obtained orI taken from the Rajah three large brass guns to add to their ownfield-pieces. The two brigades unitirx formed a considerabe force, with much cavalry ani 13guns, and they threatened Agra with a second at,tack. The oveable column was therefore urgently called for, and, making a very long forced March, it wound under the fort, a gallaut spectacle, gladdening the eyes of the long-isolated garrisoa, amid their hearty plaudits. The troops bivouacked on the caiitonment parade-ground, awaiting the gradual arrival of their tents and baggago, on that morning of the 10th of October, and the greater portion ci the officers dispersed to see and breakfast with their friends in the fort. Now, Agra, the head-quarters of the Civil Government and of a crowd of refugees, was full of purveyors of inteRigence, official aud non-official. There was nothing that happened for a long way round of which W3 had not their own particular and circwaEatainelgneTh ii a m-atangementa for guarding againstsurprises, stratagems, and tresoherous enemies were also the most perfeet ever known. tThe authorities managed to make ne lives of their j ' Government have eA.pbeqweXLa5 tken avo mia pf preQautiQn, friends- thoroulghly miserable by the excess of their preciutions. It was imporsible tc go anywhere. or do anything without being hargsea oat ofone's patience. Weli, on this rnorning of the 10th for the firxt time in th bhi.tory of beleaguered Agra,-'a the newsmongers were of one accord-they had all certain intelligence that the mutineers, after threatening to cross the small Riree river, 10 miles distant, had failed to do so, and retreat d, and were then six miles on the other side. It wai also found that they were unable to get the big guns over the liver. They were clearly making off on hearing of the approach of the column. So, friends arrived, enemies flying, an impassable stream between, and military precautions unrivalled, it well' miglit be that all Agra breakfasted that morning in peace and security, with relieved minds and grateful hearts. But suddenly, while breakfast was in every man's mouth, a big gun was heard, and another, and another, and many- more, people started-" Oh, no; it mutst be a salute, though rather irregular." Still more. guns; then people were seen hurrying from cantonment-the camp was attacked. Yes, so it was. Among their many ingenious precautionr the Agra authorities had neglected one very simple one-viz., to send some one with his eyes opent to look down the road, and the enemy had quietly marched in, big gans and all, and there was not one signal of. alarm till they actually opened fire on our disordered camp and knocked down several: mnen and horses. Then there was of course a scene of wild confusion. There was, no command and no anything, and camp followers and horses fled m all directions. If the enemy's cavalry and infantry had then pushed in the result might have been most disastrous, but, nati-ve like, they firat waited to see the effect of their big guns. That delay was fatal to them. Oar guns got into action, our cavalry mountd, and when I galloped up to the ground we were returning their fire. Teen their cavalry did charge right into the parade in a greIt "t goL" But they were too late. They took a detached and disabled gun for a moment, and they were so completely among us that the artillery could not fire on them. But the tired Sikhs sittingr on the ground formed square with the utmost coolness, and ared well into them. The Lancers were ready, and charged at them as the Lancers can charge. They were broken and defeated; yet some of them-did actually sweep rigcht round the camp and cantonmenta, and createa such a panic among the general population as scarce was seen-every one riding over every one else in the most inadiscriminate manner; in fact, there never was and never will be so complete a suirprise. Bat by this time conmmadingofficers had come on the field, and every arm was in action. Our artillery fought nobly-in fact, all did; and though it was some time before we coulld find exactly where we were and where the enemy was, and they attacked on three dides at once, eveatuaUy they were repulsed and began to retreat. In fact, I think it must be that in surprising us they surprised themselves. They could hardly have known what they were attacldng, or surely they would have made a better stand. Once they were repulsed it was all over with them. After the charge their cavalry never showed but in the distance. As soon as they were clearly in retreat we followed, and before we had gone very far they had abandoned their three big guns, and their retreat approached to a flight. Here was enough for a moderate man. Our troops, it might be fairly said, hlad had enough of it; a halt was ordered. Butt another sort of men came into play in the right place. In Agra, the command was taken bv Brigadier Cotton, called " Gun Cotton." He would noQt halt, and pushed on with fortunate dash. Speedily the enemy were eompletely dispersed and routed, and they hardly returned our fire. Their infantry merely showed at the edges of the fields and then fled through them. Soon we found and took their camp, then we came on their baggage, which they gradually abaudoned. Our HIorse Artillery from time to time gaUoped up and opened fire; then that became unnecemsary, and small bodies of cavalry continued the chase. Eventually 10 or 12 well-mounted officers made everything fly from the road, while the cavalry hunted up the fugitives on eitber side. Never was dispersion more complete. All the guns (13) and baggage were taken, and no six of the infantry went away together. Those who saved themselves did so. by hiding in the high fields, and they were no doubt numerous. There was, in fact, an end of the Mhow and Neemuch brigades, excepting the fugitive cavalry, and, after a ten-mile chase, the troops returned to relieve Agra. The Sikh cavalry behaved adrairably. The state of things is now this :-there is no open armed opposition of any considerable forces north of the Chambal. In Owalior, the Maharajah still keeps aloof from the mutineers -with his own troops and some of the Contingent whom he has gained over, including, I believe, most of the cavalry. Of infantry, the mutinous Contingent have new but four reiments, but they have a very large artilleryabout 30 field-pieces and a magazine and third-class liege train. Though they have often threatened to attack Agra, they have not done so, and have throughout followed a separate policy of their own. They are now said to be about to march on Jhansi, en ecmte to Cawnpore, but we shall see. Bundlecund is, I believe, in a bad state, and a separate cold weather campaign will be then indispensable. From Cawnpore and Lucknow we have requisitions for more troops, and the column is now movingon Cawnpore. This is the second march from Agra. At Mynupooree the opposition is not likely to be serious, though the Rajpoot Rajah is hostile. At Futtyghur there may be a srong force, butwe neednot go there, andunless it proves that we can afford to do so we may not yet attempt to occupy the country between this and Cawnpore, or to keep open our communications behind us. The column is in good bealtb and spirits, but deficient in a nucleus of reLable infantry, and 200 of the cavalry are ordered to stay at Agra. Your obedient servant. A CIVILIAN.
THE GZASGOW DEPUTATION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am instructed by the gentlemen who were named at a meeting of the merchants and manufacturers in Glas. gow last Friday to proceed to London as a deputation to Government on the subject of the then impending crisis in monetary and mercantile affdirs, to state that their atten tion has been drawn to the fo)lowing words, part of an ricle in your paper of yesterday:- The Glasgow deputation was to consist of persona "chiefly known from connexion with the Western Bank of Scotland, and the published list contained the name of a partner in one of the fizms to whom the reckless advances are aUeged to have been made which precipitated the ruin of that establishment." I am desired to mention that the above statement i3 entirely without foundation; not one of the gentlemen has any " cornexion" directly OD indireotly " with the Western Bank of Scotland ;" and I need hardly addc that the allusion to some one of them as being " a partner in one of the firms tD vhom the reckless advanoes are alleged to have been made, which precipitated the ruli of that establishmnent," is a gratuitous libel.

TEE HEALTH O LONDON. (From the Weekly Beturn of the Reglstrar-GeneraL) The stocness whichig now sogenerailydlfuie througlout the metropolitan population oonttnues to devlope itael in A high rate of mortality. The deaths registered in London, Which rose in -the previous week to 1,382, ware of rea'rly equal amount in the week that ended last Saturday (Nfovnember 28b, the number having been 1,373. In the 10 ye,rs 1847-56 the average number of, deaths inr the weeks. corre. sponding with last week wag 1,183. But the deaths of laa, week occurred in an incremed, population, -and with th view of comparison the average mwut be raisedin proportioa to the increase, in which cme it will become 1,30L Itappears, therefore, that t(ho deaths mow retnmed exceed by 72 the number whioh the average rate of mortality, as ascor. tained for the close of November, would have produced. At this period in 1847 inilnenza began to be very prevalent, and in a population which wos not so great as it Is now the deaths from all causes roaes to 1,677. The births registered last week exceeded the deathsin iha mne period by 227. In this return the number of cues in which infliuenza is x0ecmded under its specific designation Isonly 13;in the previous week it was nine. Th$ epidemic bha certin distinguishing featuers; and in aU cse where medical atitendaPt observe it, either as the primary disease, or as supervening on pulmonary or other complaints, it is important th%j it should be specially mentioned by that name which is both popular and scientific. It deserves to be noticed that the deaths referred to diseases of the respiratoy organs, which clans does not include phthisis in the tables, were precieely the same numerically as those in the same cloas in the previous week-the number in each ea havitg baen 390. This number exoeeds the eorrected average of 410 weeks corresponding with lat week by 102. Of the 390,,by far the largest proportion arose from bronchitis-namely, 217 deaths, which ar thus distributed according to the ikes at which they occurred :-75 occurred in the perloci frbm birth to 20 yeas only 5 between 20 and 40 yews, 33 in the poriod 40-60, 87 at 60-SO, and 17 at 80 years and upwAa;hs. But to correctly estimate the widely different degrees, in whiolh bronchits is fatal in different stages of life ij ia evident that these numbers must be eornpwrd with the numbers living at the several periods. In the last four weeks the deaths from bronchtis increased or decreased in the following numbers:-116, 152, 227, and 217; pneumonia, 115, 108, 327, and 143; whoopincough, 40,45, 53, and 68; phthisis, 187, 151, I59, and 17L The deaths of six nonagenarians and one centenarian are included in the returns. Among the former are two woman whose respective ages were 95 and 96 years. The most advanced in life was a man who died in Trafa1gar.road, Greenwich, said to have been 100 years old. Of 43 cases in which searlatina was fatal, four oocurred in the sub-district of St. John's, Westminster, and aieso four in that of Lambeth Church (2d part). A child died of starvation, a verdict of manslaughter having been 70oorded in this case; and a crossing-sweeper also perished from starvation. A man who had been employed by a farrier died from glanders. Lat week the births of 803 boys and 797 girls, in,all 1,600 children, were registered in lTondon. Iun the 10; eorresponding weeks of the year 1847-56 the average number was 1,487. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean heigh: of the barometer in the week was 29575 In. The instrument fell from 30 18 in. at the beglnning of the week to 29 09 in. on Taesday, tho lowest point in the week. The mean temperature of the week ws 41-6 deg., -which- is 0-4 deg. above the average of the ame week in 43 .ye4s, (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The highest resding of the thermometer was 55 3' on Monday; snd the lowest 30.5, which occurred on Wednesday. The mean daily range of the week was 13-4°. The difference between the meau dew point temperature and the mean air temperature was 19°. The mean temperaturo of the water of the Thames was 459'. The wind onthe first three days was in the south and south-west; afterwards it was motly in the north.east. The amount of rain measured was 0 78in., most of which fell on Tuesday. The first snow this winter fell on the morning of Thursday in large flakes.
STATE OF TRADE. MANCBZSTER, DEC. 1. The commercial advices from India havo to-day led to more business for Bombay and Calcutta in both yarm and cloth. The orders thrown on the market in the goods suitable to these markets have to some extent led to an im. provement of prices. Yarns are reported to be ,d. to-id. per lb. better in some quarters than the more depressed rates of last week, -while other reports si,nply re resent the market as staier. For the home tra(e and for Germany buyers have been doing nothing. and in yarns for those markets there is nothing doing. High numbers of yarn are aS mueh depressed s ever. In cloths, sellers represent the prices of shirtings for India and China as 1rd. to 3d. higher than the lowest rates of last 'week. In other cloths there is no appreciable improvement. A better tone of feeling is said to pervade the mrklet, btt it is rather from the hope induced by reports of an easier money-market in London than from anypractical oererlance of improvement here. The Greeks have been picking up quantities of long cloths and T clotha where they could lay their hands on bargains, but not to an extent suifiient to raise values. Messrs. John Slagg and Co. report:- " From the date of out last report the market experienoed no reUef from the extrene depzedon of the last tbree weeks, antu Setorday lkt, adnoe which day, owing to the relpe of very faourable accounts from Indi%, a large busies has been dons In nhlstin, jawootsand "ad pollam., n-table to that market, at a lilght advance onr the lowest prices of lat week. But though there la a doelddedl bMfter ceeUng prevalent throughout the market we do hot as Ye& Dncl say 1mproved demand for oCberkinds of geods Messrs. George Fraser, Son, and Co., say:- " There hu been more butiness doing during the lst few ds for lndia and Chns, znd tbe rwlowof suitable Yas mnd gods ase oon. a quently a little irmer. In other r"sect there Is o change In the market, tho demand continuing languid." LEEDS, Dxc. 1. The cloth-markets have worn a slightly improved appoarance this morning. Buyers operate more cireerfully, bat purchase more to make up stocks or to mneet small orders han to prepare for the spring trade. For the latter, however, there are some inquiries, and altogether the trade looks better. HUDDERSFIELD,-DEc. 1. There has been a fair attendance of buyers in the market this morning, and business to a lLrger extent thau last week has been done. A good bulk of heavy goods have been sold, and the offers betoken more animation. There has not been much done In wool, bat prices are a littae firmer.
THE WOOL MARKET. _0 LIVERPOGLi .DEc 1. The unfavourable state of buziness refesre to in on last report has existed during the whole of thopast muonth with inoreased intensity, and it may Well be -gsrded as,one of the most serious ordeals in a commercia point of view which this country has ever encountered. Almost each day has brought accounts of fresh disasteaincluding many firms of old standing and undoubted respectability, causing universal mistrust, and threatening the sandlng c he most prudent trader. Under such a state of pressure, with bho Banlof England minimum rate of discount at 10 pe;.noent., and a much higher one in the open market, sale of nearl3; all kinds of produce have been namost out of the qesetion, and have for the most part been made under circnscauaneof necesity, and the Exchange has been frequen1ted morste discuss the news of the day than for the purpom of buIaku. In the wool-market, with the ez"ptio-xt of one or twoforced sales of small amount, thereNas, bee allteraUy nothing ! doing beyoud the sale of a few halos i&l adfor. Immediate wants, and prices are altogether noesina iL t in a source of great satisfaction to notice that the woo's trade has stood its ground so weLU, very few failreesinZ ocured and only one firmn of any particular standi3g, exc *iv1 ly in t'h trade, of English on eommussion, eyi h rd flhe public sales of Colonial o whha .ve been going forwara in London since the 12th ult;, and., considering the very unfavonrable circumstances, the res ult must be considered in the highesb degree satisfaobory. On the most current k-inds of htne colonial the doaline i s 9d. to 2d. per b, and on the other sorts np to 44. per lb. , the home trade taking & larger proportion than usuL T Iese Iules will close on the 4th inst.. to be fonowed bDpulblir saJes of low descriptions on the Sth and following di;s, I D;t the quantity is not imposttnt, being aboit4.000%iJes of Eat India,and probably a couple of thouand balrsef lo w foreign. The present extremely'*igh nbat of interest mst prove a barrier to any busInesma blt i c can only be egaxrded as temporay, and there seewa-rsaso n to expect thatan immediate relation will supervene. It wil no doubt take some time to recover from the piseent shock, but we look forward to a healthy trade! anr'in f,ur next report we expect to be abin to quote 1,rices writh some degrea of preCision. lmport of For4cim W ooL.-From the 1st of Janmary to the S0th of .ovenber, 17, 1B6,467 bales; from the 1st of January te the 3OtSofv X.oevomer, 1856, 125,414 blesS.

I LONBDON, WEDYSDAY, DECEMBBR 2, 1857. The Glasgow Chamber of Commerce has joined in the agitation against the atringency of a law which has, nevertheless, been lax enough to render the proceedings of the Western Bank and of its customers practicable. According to the statement of a local journal, some of the members rose and walked out of the room when one of their colleagues, who had overdrawn his account with theWestern Bank by 60,0001., complained of the want of sufficient banking accommodation. It is unfortunately true that persons who are over head and ears in debt generally require further facilities. It is satisfactory, however, to find that even in Glasgow the justice of the demand is not universally recognized. Sir JTA s COiAa:nx, who is second to none of his fellow-citizens in commercial experience, ventured to express an opinion that in granting facilities to speculation the banks had erred rather on the side of excess; but the majority present sympathized with the indignant defaulter more than with the more scrupulous men of business whom his assurance had driven from the room. The banking facilities party at Glasgow has every reason to be satisfied with the uncompromiising devotion of its Parliamentary representatives. Mr. DiGisiOSH, at the public meeting of Thursday last, went to the verge of prudence in his demands on the public purse, and in his dlenunciation of legislative securities against fraud; but Mr. BucHAwA, in a spirit of generous rivalry, fairly outbids his colleague. Mr. BuCHANAN pledges his judgment and his knowledge of commercial transactions to the statement that there has been no overtrading whatever. A firm which displays nominal assets after failing for 400,0001. has, it seems, not overtraded, and it follows that the Bank which, with the means of knowing the circumstances, discounted the bankrupt's acceptances to an enormous amount has only in the proper discharge of its functions afforded legitimate banking facilities. The security against the recurrence of the evil is therefore to be sought. not in increased caution or in improved honesty, but in additional temptations to advance unlimited supplies of money to every claimant. The rate of discount on this theory ought to be artificially kept down, the restrictions on the circulation removed, and the operations which have brought the Western Bank to a stoppage must be carried on upon a larger scale. Against the conduct of the Joint-stock Banks Mr. BuCOHNAi has only one complaint to prefer. They have not allowed their customers sufficiently large interest on deposits; in other words, they have not completely absorbed the savings of the community; nor have they been altogether laid under the necessity of forcing out advances on doubtful security for the purpose of realizing a margin of profit over their outlay. In this instance they have been too prudent and parsimonious; their misfortunes are attributable, not to their own rashness and extravagance, but to the superfluous rigidity of the existing law. The supporters of a circulation founded on bullion are sometimes accused of exaggeration when they assert that the doctrine of their adversaries tends to the introdaction of an inconvertible currency. The controversy now carried on at Glasgow shows how few are the steps which lead from the demand for unlimited banldng accommodation to the suspension of cash payments. Mr. BucuwA, in his imprudent zeal, overleaps at one bound all the intermediate space. Having reproached the Bank of England with its share in establishing a high rate of discount, he finds himself pressed by the obvious necessity of checkdng by some means the drain of gold from this country. To meetthe difficulty he does not hesitate to propose that the Bank should have and exercise the power of raising the price of gold. The suggestion has no reference to the prlce of gold as compared with the comnmodities for which it is exchanged. Banks can exercise no influence over the proportionate supplies of commercial produce and of the precious metals. It is, of course, absurd to measure gold against itself for the purpose of determining its value. The only remainire standard of comparison is the nominal currency, or, in other words, the paper circulation. Mr. BucH"Aw, therefore, desires that the Bank should be authorized to raise the value of gold coin in comparison with notes. The 61.-note in certain cases is no longer to be worth five sovereigns, and the promise to pay in specie is to be disregarded at the pleasure of the body which has issued the obligation. The descent is easy and rapid. Traders without capital ought to be accommodated with discounts on moderate terms. To meet the demand Ihe Bank must have an unlimited power of issue; and, finally, in self-protection it must be enabled to depreciate its own notes, or to represent them by a diminished amount of gold coin. It would be difficult to point out a flaw in Ithe practical logic of the deduction. Mr. BucH"Aw has done an involuntary service to sound principles by proclaiming at the commencement of the process the result to which it is tending. It may, perhaps, be supposed that the suggestion relates rather to the price paid by the Bank for gold than to the redemption of its notes. The irregular and anomalous proceeding of the Bank of France in buying up large quantities of bullion at a loss is not without its admirers; but Mr. BucANAw I shows that he alluden to the issue by his quotatioiu of Mr. TWEXSL's authority. This gentleman is a partner of long standing in the firm of Messrs. SPOONaR anid Ar-TOOD, and among the witnmes before the committee of last Sesion ho stood alone in his recommendation of a discontiuance of cash payments. Yr. TWELLS said that he remembered 20 year of inconvertible notes, and his youthful associations were those of prosperity and progress. He had bought and sold guiinea at the market price for depreciated paper, and he saw no reason why the ame commercial operation should not be reproduced. It is against the Act of 1819, and not against the restrictions of 1844, that the zealous advocate of paper strenuously protests. Mr. Bu1BAN instinctively recognizes the connexion between th, obsolete theory of Birmingham and the spirited practice of modern Glasgow. If the city members accompany the deputation which has come up to town to require aid from Government they will do well to lay before the CHarwcuLon of the Exo-iEQun all their eventual demands. A grant of public money to the Western Bank, a prohibition of high discounts when money is scarce, ard a payment of 80 or 90 per cent. in full discharge of the notes of the Bank of England-such are the proposals on which the Minister will have to decide according to the best of his judgment. The lesson which is to be deduced from these wild speculations is obvious. It is useless to tamper with the minor provisions of an Act when the principles on which it is based are utterly irreeoncilable with the claims of its opponents. The #ddition of two millions to the securities permanently lodged in the Issue Department would be equivalent to a creation of capital to the same amount, inasmuch as it would displace a correAponding sum in bullion. It is no discovery that the maintenance of a maetallic circulation involves a certain expense. The substitution of notes for sovereigns releases a valuable commodity, but it diminishes to precisely the same extent the security for the paper circulation. An able correspondent from Manchester, in a letter published in our columns yesterday, expresses the opinion of many of his fellow-citizens when he recommends that a change shouald be effected in a direction precisely opposite. A reduction of two millions in the securities held by the Issue Department would strengthen by the sa3e amount the bullion reserve in the event of a future panic. The suggestion deserves the attention of the Government at least as fally as the previous demand for relaxation. The relief derived from an extension of the issue of paper would be limited by the expenditure of public capital, In which it would virtually consist. There would be a simuilar financial profit in selling off the stores of the army and navy, but the purpos which they are intended to serve are of more value to the nation than the money for which the articles might be exchanged. In answer to the malcontents of C-lasgow, it need only be said that the Bank, in concert with other dealers in money, has already raised the value of gold so far as to make the temporary use of that conmrodityunprecedentedly expensive. Yetthe rise in the rate of discount is made a cause of complaint, and it only remains to increase the price at which gold is issued by a depreciation of notes, which would be equivalent to a partial bankruptcy. The Government and Parliament may safely be trusted to deal with so audacious a proposal.
There are different ways of finding out that we are growing'old. One is the looking-glass, another is the alteration in your absent friend since you last saw him, another is the enlargement of your library; another is the addition of new drawers for memoranda or correspondence; another is the growth and accumulation of all sorts of rubbish about you that you don't know how to deal with, whether to bury, or to burn; another is the lengthening list of past residences in the memory; another is change of opinions. All these tests do not apply to all persons, but some to one, and some to another. We will add another now to this list of tests of advancing years, and that is the progress of the United States. Those whose political recollections can stretch five-and-twenty years back can remember the idea or image of a country which the United States then raised in everybody's mind. It was the image of a newly discovered country, for two centuries seemed hardly to have made any inroad upon that vast continent of a country that had just felt the first passage of the plough, of primmval forests, a virgin soil, of cities just rising to the dignity and importance of commerce, and of illimitable, untried resources, which absorbed the activity of fresh thousands every month, and allowed nobody to stand idle for aa hour. It was the image of a new world over which the sun rose and set without seeing want, of a world in its first springtime and infancy, when Nature repaid a hundredfold the slightest attention, and had only to be asked in order to obtain from her the amplest nourishment, of however rude and simple a kind, for everybody. That was one great contrast between the United States and England. Another was the immunity of this new world from the perplexities of diplomacy, the jealousies and rivalries, the encroachments and the resistance to encroachments, involved in the European system. In that new hemisphere war was impossible, because there was no foe, and an army was unnecessary because there was no war. Thus at one stroke an expense which swelled the budget of every nation of Europe to a most portentous size was cut off, and taxation did not rise above the lowest and simplest scale. Thus all was simple and all was primitive in the United States, soil, policy, and finance; there was nothing of the old world about them; they exulted in the light atmosphere of national youth, and rejoiced in a complete freedom from the gorgeous but onerous trappings of the States of the oid world, their pomp, titles, ceremonies, ranks, diplomacy, and taxes. Such was the picture of the United States fiveand-twenty years ago; but any one with moderate political observation wil see that this picture is now considerably altered. The United States are not, indeed, an old nation yet, but there are signs of advancing time pre5sing upon them. New York was a month ago the scene of bread riots. That is a mark of age; a nation cannot ca itself quite young that finds itself involved in a financial catastrophe, the effect of an extremely developed artificial currency, and the cause of bread riots. These are features of an old world, of long established commerce, of overgrown population. The city of New York may claim now the rank of one of those vast concentrations of human power and activity, and condensations of human life, which constitute the great cities of the old world, and with the rank it exhibits also the melancholy accompaniments of such a growth-its large needy, dependent masses, living from hand to month, and thrown out of employment immediately by any serious jar in the financial system. We may now add another sign of advancing age-a war with an unruly dependency-a war accompanied by great hardships and invelving endless marches over difficult and barren ground, where the invading army must carry everything whatever necessary for human or brute life with it. Fort Leavenworth is about 1,500 miles from the American seat of Govenment; that is no short distance, but when an American army has reached Leavenworth its hostile journey to the Salt Lake City is only begun. Another journey of 650 miles up the Platte River conduct, it to Fort Laramie, and after reaching Fort Laria f a full moth's jorey succeeds before the Salt Lake City is arrived at. Of this. month's journey the whole is over difficult country, and much of it over ground with very little gras, which, little as it ix, the Mormons will, of course, set fire to. The Mormons are perfectly aware of the advantage of their position, and meet the invasion with insolent defiance, and, it must be sadded, bitherto with succersful defiance. The American advanoed force under Colonel' AIBET JonxsToNi having proceeded 250 miles beyond Fort Iaramie is stopped by a seven-inch depth of snow, combined with- a total failure of corn and grass, the Mormon force having cut off their trains of waggons in the rear. Under these circumstances the Government expedition pause, and the rebel State has a temporary triumph. Of the tranxiency of this triumph we can have little doubt. The honour of the Federal Government and the honour of the whole of the United States is now pledged to a suppression of the Mormonite rebellion; but we have also little doubt that the affair will cost a good deal, and swell disagreeably the United States' budget. The United States, in short, as they advance to importance and dignity are also rapidly advancing to the cares, responsibilities, and expenaes of empire. This Mormonite war is creditable to them; they could not, consitently with the national honour and with respect for their own position among civilized nations, have avoided it. No rnation that is a member of the great eircle of civilized nations, and forms a part of the establiahed phalanx of civilization in the world, can escape the duty of defending the necessary laws of civilization. That cause is a sacred and sublime cause committed to its trust by PRovIDxNc, and it cannot-avoid the responsibility of it without giving up its place in the civilized world, and its fellowship in the association of civilized nations. The United States have only acted in consitency with their poition as a civilized State in refusing to recognize and sanction the system of polygamy, which the Mormonites have endeavoured to engraft upon the American national code; and it is this refusal which has brought on this war. But, while we give the United States aU credit for not having avoided an honourable war, we must observe at the same time that wars such, as these are a sign of a nation's growing years. This is no bad compliment to a country, as it is to an individual; the age of a nation is its glory and pride-it is what gives it character, life, and weight. A new nation, like a new word, is a formless, nondescript thing; it is hardly a nation at all till it is in some sense in old nation, tiU it has a past, a vista of events to look back upon, a history to recall. But the honours of growing antiquity bring their responsibilities, encumbranmces, Perplexities, and grievances with them, jars and collisions in the State, difficulties of finance, popu. lar distress, wars, taxation. The crown of empire, like the crown of reason, brings its cares with it and sits heavily upon the brow. " It is not for a " statesman," says Ho3x=, "to rest all the " night-he must be wide awake while others are "s leeping." Our Transatlantic kinsmen are in their private business quite up to this duty, and they will now in their national capacity have more and more to exercise it.
Two Courts-martial which have just taken place in India give token that a firmer haud has grasped the reins of military authority, and that the lesson taught by the present convulsion will not be lost for want of a man competent to understand it. The firat to which we may call attention assembled at Dinapore iu September, for the trial of four privates of the QuEEN's 10th Iufantry on a charge that they did " feloniously, vilfully, "and of their malice aforethought kill and "murder one Hurro Kn1w, Subahdar Major of "the 40th Regiment of Native Infantry." The circumstances of the affair may be in the recollection of our readers. It arome out of General LLoYD's unfortunate expedition to AraT, in which the 10th Regiment suffered so severely. When the news was brought back that their comrades had been basely slaughtered by a gang of mutineers, that part of the 10th which still remained in cantonments at Dinapore was highly excited. Whether a fear for their own safety or a desire of vengeance principally possessed them, the result was that the 10th rushed upon the 40th Native Infantry, also stationed at Dinapore, and drove them from the cantonment, killing and wounding some 50 of their number. No doubt the four prisoners, who from their names appear to be Irishmen, were in the thickest of the fray. In accordance with the traditions, of Calcutta, they were solemnly arraigned on a charge of wilful murder. The Court-martial has solemnly acquitted them. The result cannot but be received with satisfaction by every sensible man. That the lives of natives should be pro. tected is of course just enough; but, considering the universal treachery which has been manifested by the Bengal Army, and particularly in the slaughter of Arrah, we cannot be surprised that a corps which suffered like the 10th should be excited to attack a Sepoy Regiment which might be expected at any moment to imitate the atrocities which were being enacted elsewhere. Sir CoL.NA CAMPBXL expresses his gratification that " the prosecution has completely "failed in bringing evidence against them, and "that they have been consequently exonerated by "the Court-martial assembled for their triaL." The next ease is more painful, and the Commander-in-Chief in dealing with it was called upOn to perform the harshest duty which can fa'l to one in his position. There seems, however, to have been but one course open. On the same day that the four privates were acquitted, Lieutenant OusrLEY, of the 22d Bengal Native Infantry, was arraigned on the charge of having, when on duty under arms on the outlying picket at Dinapore, on or about the 1st of August last, been found drunk. The Court found the pri. goner guilty, and sentenced him to be cashiered, recommending him, however, to mercy on account of " the recent exposure, hardships, and excessive " anxiety of mind he had undergone, without "food for days, and in the hourly expectation " of being murdered, and also on account of his " youth and inexperience." This recommendation Sir CoLIN CA3trBRErL sternly refused to entertain. In strong terms he rebukes the pity of the Court, and asks, "fHow " could the Commander-in.Chief enforce strict "duty from a sentry if he were to overlook "an act of disgraceful and outrageous "drunkenness in an officer actually command"ng an outlying picket I' Lieutenant OuszI" was consequently at once struck off the strength of the army. With no wish to add to the humiliation of the unhappy young man, Who we hope will find employment in some other career, but from a feeling that strict discipline is more than ever required in Iudia, we must rejoice at the vigour displayed by the Commander-in-Chief, both in his deciion and the language in which it is proclaimed. Sir CoLIN comments on the fact that the field officer of the day found Lieutenant OusESXy drunk at 3 o'clock in the morning, and yet did not arrest him or remove him from his picket, but contented himself with making a report at 9 o'clocsk the next morning. Moreover, the Captain of the day, when visiting an outlying picket, coDtented himself with calling from a distance " Is all right r' and thus did not "' ViAit the pioket" a re I

LIGHTS XLv T'lE PIRIR' OX FOBTB. TO TUE EDlTOW OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Even a careless reader of your paper to-day must be struck with the strange fact that two steamvesse]s, one going out and the other coming into the Firth of Forth, struck on the same day upon the same rock. The name of this dangerous reef is the NorthCarrRock. On itmanyanobleship has laid herbones,and manya valuable lifebeen lost. Ibelieve there is such a thing as a Board of Northern Lights, and I want to direct its attention to what may be called the lightless state of the Firtli of Forth. This North Carr Rock lies opposite Crail, on the Fifeshire coast, right in the fairway of vessels making for the northern ports, and I see by the chart that it has on it a beacon. Now, a beacon is a very good thing in its way, endowed with many good qualities, only it is not luminous; it does not emit rays of light, and therefore it is useless at 4 o'clock on a November morning. I dare say the Board of Lights will say there is a light near the spot. There is the double light on the Isle of May, which ought to be seen by vessels near the North Carr Rock. Welll this is Tery true; but, unfortunately, in misty weather-and it is sometimes misty even in the Firth of Forth-the May Light can't be seen at the North Carr Rock. By all means, then, let the Northern Board of Lights, or whoever may be intrusted with this duty, take measures to put a light on this rock, and no longer boast of their one light on the Isle of May. This is the state of things on the Fifeshire side of the Firth ; one light on the Isle of May, and then no light idll you get to Inchkeith, nearly abreast of Leith. But on the opposite coast matters are much worse. It will hardly be believed, and yet, if my chart does not deceive me, it is a fact, that there is no light at all on the south side, between :Eyemouth and Inchkeith. There is no light on St. Abb's Head, no light at Dunbar, ino light at Tautallon, no light on the Bass Rock, no light at North Berwick. It is difficult to conceive a more dangerous coast, and only last winter two vessels were lost, man and mouse, on the South Carra under Tantallon, blood relations of the Fifeshire North Carr, and, like it, marked by a miserable beacon. If you will give insertion to these remarks they may rouse the authorities to some little activity, and we may yet see lighthouses erected both on the North and South Carrs. If so you will have helped to save many valuable lives. 1 am, yours. (lART AWAV Dec. Ist. I.3. 1 see the GJazette this evening contains notices from the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses that several new lights have been recently exhibited on the west coast of Scotland. Is it too much to hope that the Commissioners may bestow a little attention on the east coast ? The trade which passes up and down the Firth of Forth is at least as important as that of South Uist, South Rona, and Loch Alsh put together.
SIR ARCHDALE WSo oi DELi.-The accounts of General Wilson's retirement from his command on the ground of ill-health not having been very explicit, the public may perhaps be interested to learn that a letter has this week been received from Lady Wilson, stating that on the 8th of October General Wilson arrived at Mussouree on sick leave, so exhausted that he was scarcely able to walk. She rejoiced, however, to be able to add that he had no positive illness, and was at the date of her letter (October 12) greatly improved. The General had directed his family to address their future letters to Meerut, where he was shortly about to rejoin his brigade and to hold himself in readiness for any command that might be given him. The Addrem of the Lords, in reply to the Speech from the Throne, will be moved by Lord Portman and seconded by Lord Carew.-Globe. A Cabinet Council was held yesterday at the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury in Downing-ntreet. The Ministers present were-Viscount Palmerston, the Lord Chancellor, Barl Granville, the Marquis of Lansdowne, the Earl of Harrowby, Sir George Grey, the Earl of Clarendon, Mffr.

MONEY-ArARKBT and CITY INTELLIGERN C. .---- o Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 5 per mile premium, and the short exchange on London is 25 37k per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 17s. M0id. per ouince for staudard gold, it appears that gold is about 3-](Otbs per cent. desrer in London than in Paris. By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 per mark, and the sbort excbange on London is ]3-61 per ll. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about 9-lOths per cent. dtarer in London than in Hamburg. The course of exohange at New York on London for biUs at 60 days' sight is about 108I per cent. for firat-clas paper. At the present rate of diEcount here there is consequently no profit on the transmission of gold from this country to the United States. The English funds have been flat to-day, and have experienceRd a reaction of a quarter per cent. Consols for money opened at the closing price of last evening-91i, but a disposition to effect realizations was so(n manifested, aud there 'were for a short time sellers at 91. The market then slightly recovered, axnd the final operations were at 91. to t for money, and 9lQ to ; for the 8th of January. A demand for ailver for Hamburg in consequence of the intensity of the commercial crisis in that city, and some doubts as to wbetber the Bank of England will make their usual advances on stock during the approaching shutting of the transferbooks, seemed to be the chief causes of the tendency to depression. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 216; Reduced and New Three per Cents, 90 to i ; India Stock, 218 to 220; India Bonds, 30s. to 25s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 5s. discoint to par. Money was in increased demand to-day in the Stock-Exchange, and the rates on Government securities were 6 per cent. for short loans, and f lly 9 per cent, from account to account. At the Bank of England the applications were likewise considerable, although not excessive. The preparations for the 4th of the month cause the inquiry to be active, and fears a e entertained that numerous smal failures may be announced on that day. The traneactions in foreign stocks have been rather numerous, especially on speculative account, and the market closes steadily. Turkisb, after several fluctuations, left off i per cent. lower than yesterday. Mexican were slightly firmer. Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents. were negotiated at 941 ; BueIos Ayres, for the account, 85; Cbilian Six per CentP., 102 ; Danish Three per Cents., 83k; Mexican, for the account, 1k and 19; Peruvian Four-and-a- Half per Cents, for the account, 76i; ditto Three per Cents., for the account, 51t; Russian Four-and-a-EHalf per Cents, 96i and96; Spanish Certificates, 5J; Turkish Six per Cents., 91; for the account, 91k, 4, i, i, and i; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 99t ; for the account, 99i; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 63i and and 63. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates generally were slightly higher than last post. The final quotations of the Fench Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 10c. ior money, and 67f. for the present account, shoving a decline of nearly a quarter per cent. About 60,0(101. in gold was taken to the Bank today. It consisted of Australian, American, Russian, and a variety of miscellaneous parcels. About 15 000 sovereigns were withdrawn to purchase silver to send to Hamburg. 80,0001. in silver was transmitted this afternoon to Hamburg, chiefly to take up bills whioh have been drawn and endorsed by persons on this side, and 'which the Hamburg acceptors are unable to meet. Two remittances of gold, amounting together to 120,0001., on their 'way from St. Petersburg, have been delayed for a short time by accidents to the steamers. The navigation being now closed, these axe the last sums that can be sent except by the more expensive land route. The suspension was announced to-day of Messrs. Hermann Cox and Co., of London and Liverpool, a respectable and well-known house, chiefly engaged in the cotton trade. The liabilities are estimated at about 60,0001., and the prospects of the liquidation will ultimately depend upon the realization of the stock of cotton in hand and tbe amounts that may be recovered on bills held upon failed houses. The firm hope to make such arrangements as will enable them to resume. Annexed is the circular issued "18, Mark-lane, Dec. L "It is witn the deepest pain we have to inform you that, Jn conseqenece of very severe and sudden losses, we are compelled to suspend our payments. "We have placed our books in the hands of Messrs. Qu31ter, Ball, and Co., with instructions to prepare a statement of our affairs, and submit the same to our creditors ss soon as practicable. * tectul1y, "HER&rNN COXND CO." The suspension has also been announced of Messrs. Bischoff, Beer, and Co., merchants, connected with the East India and continental trade, with liabilities for about 30,0001. Their circular states as follows:- " London, 12, Bucklersbury, Nov. 27. ' It is with deep regret that we have to announce to you that, inconsequence partly of unexpecteddelayinthe receipt of remittances from Calcutta, and partly of the failure of certain houses on the continent, we find ourselves under the necessity of suspending payments. "1 We confidently trust that this suspension vwiU be only momentary, as our books ahow that our business is in a sound and wholesome condition, and that now we only yield to the pressure of the times. " Our affairs have been placed in the hands of competent professional men who we hope will very aoon be in a position to report to yau satisfactorily. ' BISCHOFF, BEER, sND Co." The following letter, like some which have preceded it from other correspondents, expresses, it is believed, the almost unanimous feeling of the commercial public on the impolicy of any loan for India being entertained in this country. Within the past few days an impression has gained ground that the Government concur in the objections cited, and consequently that no such operation 'will be attempted; but this still lacks formal or official confirmation, and therefore must not be implicitly relied upon. The temptation to evade the trouble and responsibility of devising any other than the routine plan of creating Consols whenever money Is wanted is such that neither the Indian nor home Government can be fully trusted to resist it. At the same time, the public must keep in view that if a direct loan is avoided there are other means not unlikely to be adopted 'which may produce even worse effects. During many coming years the internal improvement of India is certain to be advocated on an almost unlimited scale. Rail and tram roads, irrigation 'works, steam flotillas, and every other aid to the development of the resources of the country will be demanded by each Presidency. If the system is to be pursued of inviting English capital for these purposes,a drain will be set up such as will soonicause a renewal of general embarrassment. The natives will continue to hoard the wealth thus thrown upon them, and whenever the time comes for the outlay to cease they 'will look 'with mortification at the turn of the tide and the profits of thair enterprises being shipped off in the shape of dividends to Europe. Hence the effect would be to impart an unhealthy stimulus to their cupidity for 1.0 or 20 years, and then to give them an interest in getting rid of our rule and appropriating free of cost the advantages we have conferred upon them. The principle, therefore, should be to draw out Indian mnoney for Indian improvements. - Whether capital be raised in England or India, it must be by means of a guarantee, and this guarantee should be offered to the natives, instead of to the London speculators in premiums. They would thus be heartily enlisted in these improvements by the tangible ties of personal property, and would have a new stimulus to net in support of the laws by which that property is protected. As all Indian enterprises go to a premium aa soon as the requisite Government guarantee is s- cured, of course the London promoters have hitherto been anxious to have the power of distributing the shares almost exclusively to the public on this side. Henceforward, with the exception of such schemes as have already been broached and taken up by the public, the stipulation should be that at least two-thirds or three-fourths of the subscriptions to each guaranteed undertaklng should be supplied in India. If a higher guarantee were required in that country than in London, it should be granted for the portion so contributed; but the dividends, with the exception of those on the Uondon amount, should permanently be payable only at Calcutta, Madras, or Bombay. All danger of their being turned to jobbing purposes in our market would thus be averted, and to whatever extent the advancement of Indii might be carrled, there would be no apprehension that it would be at the cost of fimancial disturbance in any quarter "Londfn, Nov. 30. "Sir,-One principal effect of a Cousocutive rise in the rate of Interest is to reduce the cost of onr itnports by returing in the countries whence exported a less money value for their shipments, and eventually to throw the balance of trade in favour of this country, asd consequently the exchanges. "ThegreatfallhereonLall descriptions of Bastern produce is already effecting its natural results. In theanticipation of a heavy fall in the Eastern exchanges bullion remittances hence have almost ceased, the last steamer of the 20th inst. having taken out only 318,788t, of which the sum of 67,64L. was on private account, and the remainder, 251, 174., consisted of remittances by the East India Coua- y. The relief which the cessation of this drain (averaging tor the last year 1, 2O0,00 per month) would soon afford to the market is incalculable. " The beneficial effects of this favourable feature, however. will be entirely counteracted should there be any foundation for the rumourthatGovernmentintendto raise aloaninthis country for India. Were a loan raised here it must be remitted to that country in silver, which could at preeent be procured only by our purchasing it In the continental markets, at a greatly enhanced price, for Rold. This would have the effect of at oncea raising the exchange, and of again causing a heavy drain of gold, and decreasing the Bank reserves. In the present crisis it seems most improbable that Government should contemplate such a measure; and, if xoutine would permit, nothing would tend more to confirm fast returning tinancial confidence than an announcement through some of theofficial organs that no such measure was under consideration. IIWhatever future form of government Parliament may decide upon for our Eastern dominions, there cannot be a queetion that British supremacy there will be established on a firmer basis than ever. All that the native capitalists would require to induce them to renew their money dealings with theIndian authorities is a guarantee from the Im. perial Governmentthat thelegerdemain resorted to in certain recent transactions would not be again permitted. " The Imperial Government cannot incur any real liability in granting such a guarantee, for, supposing the extreme case that we lost India, the guaran'ee would at once cease. At anytime we have the power of paying off the whole Indian debts by permitting the Zemindars in the perpetualy settled districts of Bengal to acquire the fee simple of their land at from 25 to 30 years' purchase of their Government rent; thus giving a stimulus to the permanent improvement oi the land, and to the Zemindars and farmers a direct interest in the stabihty of the Government. " Alkhbars territories never eualled our Eastern possessions, yet his revenues exceeded by 10 millions sterling annually those which we have ever raised. Under his sway there was a complete and eff'ective revenue system, and at the same timnea fair dispensation of justice and protection of property. With that revenue he. conquered kingdoms, removed cities at his pleasuro, and executed extensive public worlks; and these, be it remembered, at a time when the exports of his territories were not one-twentieth of those of our Eastern dominions nor had he our advantage of a balance of trade, amountmgeto 12 millions annually, remitted to him in bullion from Europe. " Althoughitmight be a simpler operation for Cannon-row, Leadenhall-street, and the Executive Government of India to invest promises to pay in London, rather than incur the slightest trouble in an attempt to place our Indian finances in a position to meet all legitimate expenditure, it is nevertheless questionable whether the taxpayers of this country, depressed as all mercantile affairs are at the present moment, would be equally contented with such an arrangement. "On a comparative valuation of taxation and labour our fellow-subjects in the East pay about half our exactions in this country. The taxation here is about 21. per head per aunum, and, taking agricultural wages at 10s, per week, a labourer here requires four weeks' worktorepresent bis share of the burden; while in our Indian dominions the average taxation is under 4s. per head per annum, and the wages of the agricultural labourer 7s. 6d. per mouth; the earnings therefore of two weeks only are required as the taxable proportion of the Indian labourer. "Tlze Times having consistently advocated the sound policy that India under any circumstances must pay her own way, it is tobe hoped that if any attempt, direct or indirect be made to shift a legitimate liability from the shoulders of those well able to bear it to those of the hard-working and heav3ly-taxedpopulation of the UnitedKingdom, it wig continue to be strongly reprobated. "I am, Sir, your obedient servant, I J T. YL" It is understood that at a meeting of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce to-morrow a petition to the House of Commons will be proposed in favour of the Bank Charter Act, and praying an inquiry whether its suspension has not arisen from the reckless system of banking, and consequent expansion of unsound trade pursued, by some of the Joint-Stock banks which have recently stopped payment. The Manchester merchants have long had a reputation for sounder views on currency than any of their neighbours, and it is to be hoped they will still support it. At Glasgow on Friday last the Chamber of Commerce came to a resolution that the existing issue of notes upon securities is "insuflicient for the present requirements of commerce;" but they omitted to pass, also, a resolution that when the issue shall have been increased to such amount as they consider necessary the efflux of gold to a corresponding amonolt which will then immediately take place shall be compensated by a further issue, and that this process shall be continued until there is not an ounce of gold in the country and as long afterwards as may be found convenient. A meeting of creditors of Messrs. Rose, Higgins, and Rose was held on Monday at Wolverhampton, when a composition of 6s. 8d. in the pound was offered and refused. Tne liabilities are stated to be 72,6011., and the amets are estimated at 29,4171. It was ultimately decided to place the estate under the bankruptcy law. At a meeting of the African Steam Ship Company this afternoon, Mr. P. D. Hadow in the chair, the report and accounts were adopted unanimously, and a dividend declared for the half-year ending the 31st of October of 6s. per share, being at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, free of income-tax. The chairman congratulated the proprietors upon the improved prospects of the undertaking, although the board had been unable to obtain from the Government any modification of thepresentunremunerative mailcontract. Anew steamer-the Armenian, of 1,140 tons-has been bought to supply thevold caused by the loss of the Niger, and from the pressure upon the money-market the price paid has been only 16,0001., or about 141. per ton. A short conversation took place upon the valuation of the company's vessels in the accounts, the nature of rendering the accounts themselves, and some printed statements that had been circulated among the shareholders, and in each case the chairman gave explanations satisfactory to the meeting, The development of the internal African trade is relied upon by the company to insuire their permanent prosperity, and it was stated that river steamers drawing little water could penetrate the interior as far as Timbuctoo. The report of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company issued preparatory to their meeting on the 5th recommends the usual half-yearly dividend of 3i per cent. and a bonus of like amount. The annexed relates to the question as to the most expeditious mode of transmitting our Indian malls to and from France :-r- "The despatch of the Indin mall from Paris to London on Saturday last affords a sidng instance of the facilities afforded by the route by Boulogne. Although the mall reached London too late on Saturday evening for the distributton of the bulk of the correspondence, the detention arose almost entirely from time lost between Marseilles and Paris, so that the departure from Paris, which had been expected to be at 6 a.m., did not take place until a few minutes before 10. Once away from Paris, the whole transit to Iondon was accomplished in 10 hours and a-half, and, although the period of passing through Boulogne was unfortunately that of dead low water, the mail boxes were put on board the steamer in the reads without much delay, notwithstanding the heavy north-east gale which on that day, as well as on the preceding and following days, rendered it impossible to communicate with vessels in the road3tead at Calais, and on each occasio* detained the ordinary Paris and Londoni maus several hours In excess of the regulation timefor making the journey, which itself exceeds by two hours the time occupied by tho transit of the India mail on Saturday. There can be little doubt that if the Post-office authorities employed the Boulogne route for the outward India mail as well as the homeward the detention on Thursday last (detailed In The Times) would have been avoided, and that the mail which left Dover at 12 p.m., but could be landed in Calais harbour only at 6 a.m. on Friday, would have been landed in Boulogne-roads in time to leave for Paris by the 3.35 am. mail-train, and would have reached that capital five hours earlier than It actually did. It is curious that the winds which pro- duce most inconvenience at Calais (those from SE.' leave the water smooth off the shore at Boulogne, and that the worst wind at Boulogne (S.W.) Is generally little felt off Calais. It would consequently appear that if the two ports were used concurrently m carrying on the mall service between London and Paris the amount of delays and ir-Pa laritles would be reduced to the iniimum possible under any circumstances; and with the present packetand railway services such an arrangement would be quite prcticable, if the telegraph was brought to lend its dily aid towards the neessarily varylng arrangements. Even if it were determined to maintain the longer route by Calais as the aormal route, and only to select the Boulogne roate 'hen the concurrence of low water and N.E winds interposed obstcles at Calais, the result would be to save the greater part of those detentions and irregularities which have been so frequent during the past year; but the best plan would undoubtedly be to make the shortest route viafBoulogne, which Is now used on occasions like the transmission of the homeward Inldia mail, when the utmost possible celerity is deslred, the normal route, and only to have recourae to that vd Calass when the concuarence of low water and strong S.W. winds threatened obvlous delay at Boulogne, "W." The following account of the Manchester markets during the past month is from Messrs. Robert Barbour and srother:- "The financial crisis had compartively little effret oz prices hhere until the beginnig of the present month, bti ince then the decline hks been very considerable. Spinpern and manurfcturers supplied themselves ilrgely with cotton at the high prices of September, and they gor over October pretty well with the contracts they had previously taken; but this month very few sles have been made, and there is a large accumulation of stocks. Prices have been very Irregular, and there has been considerable eagerness to realize, without, however, any general desire or neCessity manifedt- ng itsel to sacrifios for the purpose of raising money, but occaiona p hases have been made at extremely low prices for Cash. An average reduction in values of 20 to 25 per cent. may be quoted compared with the rates current two months ago. In this respect the market has only followed the course of the raw material, and prices, compred with cost, are not lower than they have been on many sormer oocaons, or than they were at this time hsat ear. There Is at least a- third less produoed than usual, which no doubt tends to support the market. Up to the present timo this district haa withstood the effects of the coelmercial convulsion better than any of the other communities of the kingdom, showing theadvantage of the system of cash ayments and limited credit, bill transactions being the exception to the usual mode of settlement. Business has been better during the last few days, as an opinion begins to revaildththewortispast. Anyimprovement,however, keysilto be irstarded by occasonal failures here as well as elsewhere, mrny concerns being weakened by holdmpg,aper on fallen houws and by lage loBses on produce." addition to the gold ahips already reported on their way to England the Suffolk left Melbourne on the 3d of October with 112,446 ounces of gold, valued at 449,7841. The Atrato mail steamer, to sail to-morrow for the West Indies, will take out 3,7651.
LIVBRPOOL CHAMBBR OF COMMBROB. geerl LMVRP00L, Nov. 30. 7the quarterly generalmeeting of this body was held this afternoon at the office, Exchange-buildings for the pur. pose of receiving the teport of the council and transating other business. The chair was occupied by Mr. Chrlstopher Bushell, the vice-president, in the unavoidable absence of the preddent, Mr. J. Torr; and there was a large attendance of members. Mr. T. B. Horafall, hiP., was present, and the Chairman stated that Mr. Joseph Christopher Ewart, I'P., was proventeA from attending by his duties as a member of the grand jury which commenced to-day. The Secretary (Mr. R. Txonson) read the report, which revidwed the operations of the coancil during the past three monihs. The exhaustive statement made by the Chairman renders it unnecessary to present a summary of the docazient. The CmiErtmx, in moving the adoption of the report, speaking of the law relating to bas,kropts, with reference to which the council had taken action in conjunction with the Law Amendment Society, said therewas perhaps no law more affecting the commerce of the country. Though we bad an expensive machinery with the view of facilitating the receipts of assets in insolvent estates, and of justly distributing them among the creditors, yet for son,e cause, either from the comp]ication of the machinery itself, or from the great expense attending applications to the courts, those laws had been made comparatively little available. It became perfectly clear, therefore, that the Courts of Bankruptcy should either be abolished altegether, or that such alterations should be made as would be likely to render them of same substantial use. (Cheers.) With this object in view, the Law Amendment Society held a meeting to which the Council of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce sent a deputation; and that subject was fully discussed. Since then it had formed the topic of discnssion at one of the sectional meetings at the Birmingham Con. ference, and it was decided to aid those measures deemed necessay for the preparation of a Bil likely to give success to the working of the bankraptcy laws. Re (Mr. Busheil) trusted that matters were now in suoh a position that ere long they would hear of such a revision of the bankruptcy laws, and of the introduction of such facilities for winding -up bankrupt and insolvent estates-it was proposed to conwolidato the two in one-that the bankraptcy lawrmachinery would do what it had never done before-insure confidence in the mercantile community. (Hear, bear. Bavingre. ferred to the Judgments Execution BilL the Chairman, speaking of the new Liverpool Dock Board, which will come into power in January next, expressed a hope that it would be so composed as to secure the confidence not only *f Live6rpool, but of the mercantile communities of the whole world. (Cheers.) With respect to the question of dock extension and dock accommodation, he observed that it was justly thought by the council of the Chamber that, however desirable and however the corpora. tion were bound to carry out the requirements of the Legis. lature with regard to the completion of the dock works at Birkenhead, yet there was an undue restriction imposed upon Liverpool; that, while rigidly obeying the orders of Parliament, they should not, on the other hand, be per. mitted to carry on dock extension on the Liverpool side of the Mersey. (Cheers.) Another subject ef consideration was how far the existing dock spae was made available by the introduction of improved mechanical appliances which would enable them to do more work, keeping pace to some extent with the iecrease of the commerce of the port, without the necessity of opening new docks to the extent which it now seemed requisite. (Hear, hear.) Speaking next in reference to the discoveries of Dr. Livingstone, and of the desirability of taking advantage of that traveller's explorations to carry commerce and civilization to Central Africa, the Chairman stated that a memorial from the council to Lord Clarendon upon the subject had elicited a favourable reply. and he believed be m ht say that there was no doubt that Government would, if they had not already done so, send out a steamvessel, with scientific engineers and surveyors, to report as to how far the Zambese river on the south-ust coast was navigable, as to the nature of the rapid 300 miles up the river, and as to ho- far that physical impediment-if it were an impediment-could be removed. (Cheers.) As to postal matters, Mr. Busheil reported that steps had been taken with a view to increase the facilities of postal communication with the continent, and particularly with Northern Germany, to secure which the council had suggested to the Postmaster-General the feasibility of supplementing the regular mall trains from Liverpool, Machester, and elsewhere, by forwarding letter bags by ordinary passenger trains throughout the day. The Postmaster-General, through Mr. Rowland Hill, had replied that the difficulty in the way was the railway companies, who refused to convey any bags, however small in bulk, except on the usual terms for mail trains. Now, as those bags would not interfere with the gene. ral traffic of the railways, he (Mr. Bushell) thought the companies might have acted a little more liberally in the matter. (Hear, hear.) The Postmaster-Genaral, however, had pointed out a mail train which left Liverpool at 10 30 am., by means of which merchants despatched letters to be in time for the continental mail from London. That was a privilege and a great advantage. (Hear, hear.) The Chairman, nproaching the subject of the present financial crisis, said,We are constantly charged with a desire to hush up what are termed commercial delinquencies. Now, although the late monetary crisis may be considered both a different and a difficult subject to touch upon, we are not aware that the merchants of Liverpool, as a body, have aught in relation to it, deeply as they have suffered by it, to be either ashamed or afraid of; so far from it, considering the intimate commercial relationship between Liverpool and New York, where this panic originated, and the fearful decline in every description of produce consequent upon it, we have the greatest reason, not to boast, but to be thankful that up to this time so few of our merchanW houses have fallen. (Hear, hear.) Whatever charge of reckless trading may be justly brought against some in every commercial community, the fact of so much stability under such a crushing pressure must, in fairness, be taken as an evidence of the prudence and legitimate tradiRg of the majority. (H?ear, hear.) But, while we feel and say this, let us not shut our eyes to the fact that these oft-recuring crises through which in our own day commerce has passed are evidences, true as cause and effect that there is something wrong in onr system, some disturbingeause in the commercial body which periodically breaks out into these fearful epidemics. Now, it cannot be denied that the natural inclination is to look for the cause in some legislative enactment which we think intarferes with the sanitary action of trade. Well, let us by all means inquire into such enactments immediately and without delay, and bring to bear alike upon the principles and details involved in them a wise, and just, and temperate consideration. (Hear, hear.) But let us not stop here; let us also inquire whether there is anything within the commercial system to which we may in some degree, if not altogether, trace these great calamities, (Hear, hear.) The inancial and commercial credit of Great Britain is unquestion. ably one of our greatest eloments of national prosperity So far as that credit Is based UDon our wealth, industr, and freedom, it is a great blessing * but credit, like all other good things, may be used or abused. It Is legitimately and properly used when it is, as we have said, based upon our capital, our Industry, and our prudence, It is shamefully abused when it has no other foundation than a bold and reckless daring, which, regardless of all consequences, deals with hundreds . of thousands as though they were grains of sand, upon the principle of "Heads I win; tails you lose," and 'unfortunately, too, when too often the condemnation or applause attending it depends too much upon the measur of ailure or success which may result. (Hear, hear.) It is well known that such a system of credit, so deeply to be condemned, not less on moral than on comnercial grounds, has of late years too much prevailed, not in Great Britaln or in America only, but throughout the commercial world; that it has raised up and fostered a daring and speculative spirit which has rendered even the legitimate and prudent operations of commerce, as carried on by the fair trader, both difficult and dangerous, and which hasin no mnall degree tended to produce those y-eriodical convulsons which involve whole communities in elmost common ruin. (Hear, bear.) Now, seeing that the credit systemof commerce is carriedon chiefly by meonsof bills of exchange; seeing that there must be three parties to each bill-a drawer, an accepter and, last not least, a discounter-it seems 'reasonable ticat if caspitalists, our mnoneylenders4, discount brokers, and hankers, would reard the chracer and means of those who make these bills more than the mere ragnitude of their transactions, they do hold the checkstrings in their own hands, and have, individually and collectively, the power at once and henceforth to remedy one great cause of these oft-recurring evls, and to restore prudence and safety, in a great degree, to the£future operations of commerce. (Cheers.) It is perfectly clear that by some means a larger superstructure of credit has been raised upon the capital employed in commerce than the foundation, however strong, has been able to bear, and the superabundant weight has caused thewhole fabric to totter, and has brought no small portion of it to the ground. (Hear, hear.) This structure of credit has row to be rebuilt; let s al earnestly inquire how aud to what extent it can best be rebuilt to insure to the utmost extent stability and safety. (Cheers.) He concluded by moving the adoption of the report. Mr. T. B, HoRs8ATy Lp,., in seconding the report, spoke of the necessity of proceeding with docks on the Liverpool side of the Mersey as well as at Birkenhead; for even when the whole of the Birkenhead Docks were completedl there would not be sufficient dock space for the reiuirements of the trade of the port. He wa glad the rhm er o Commerce had expressed a decided pno 9 the subjoct, and he hoped -that they wonld reiterate tiat opiuioa until justfjo was done to the cotunoero of the pori Mr. 3lorsfail confirmed the statements of the Coairna with reference to the Government expeditiol to the Zru. oese river; and 'smee some observations with respect to the Bank Charter Aot, which, he sgid, had been acknolwledged to have fsaled; remarking that so long as reckles trading took plAce,-and that there had been reckless trading to some extent tbey would all agree-so long as there was reckless trading, no ank Charter in the world, however perfect, would ever be the means of preventing those consequent panics whtoh had periodically occurred in this country. tHear, bear) Speaking of the state of India, Mr. Horsfall said there was no doubt some material change must take place in the govemnment of that country; but they must hear In mind how far it would be an Improvement to place the whole of the immense patronage pertainiog to the ruling of that country in the hands of Her Majesto's Government, and they ought to consider whether that patronage waes likely to be better appropri tei thhn it had been under the manage. miaent of the East India Company. The report wvas carried neon. dis. Mr. POBWOOD moved a resolution to the effect "Thst this meeting tmut that the quek5ion of ntalgamxtlon between the Lancashire and Yorkhbira and East Lino .hlreatslwa, Qosnpaces wil reirs the attentton of the ouociLt with the view ot escsintringz'hwether It Wil be calculatel to l,svOe iz4urlous to the commneroe of tbe port, and to take much further steps as in apDear desizable"-I Mr. W'Fix seconded the moton, -which was carried. Mr. J. T. DAiso?, barrister, moved a resolution to the effect "That the Oourcl oi the Chambar be rtquesed to direct pirtlnser attention to the two pest topics-the revidon of the BDuok Acts 1814 and 18S, and the reorganiafAtonof the Government of Indle In order that the hamber bay be prepaed to tate such aotlon as maybe deemed requizIte.' Mr. WArsow soeonded the proposition, which gave rise to some discussion as to the cause of the alleged failure of the Bank Charter, Mr. M'Fie attributing the weakness to the stringent provilon for the payment of Bannk of England notes in 5ard cash, without also insisting that all deposits should be in hard cash. Mr. RAWLiNS said, if the Bank of England was to be considered a national insttution (as one gentleman had observed), it was not fit to cofiduct the national buslness effi. ciently with 11,000,0001. of its capital lent to Governmaent, and 3,000,0001. locked up in bank iues, the whole hsue to be paid on demand, No doubt the first caueo of the monetary difficulty was reekless trading; but it was a fact established before the House of Commons and Houe of Loret that the Bank Act, when in operation, inereased a panla wihich it did not prevent. He was very glad the attention of t4e Charnber had been drawn to the question Theresolution Was then*adopte, anda votesof£thanks to the President terminated the proceedings.
TRB CITY OF GLASGOW BANK. (BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.) GLASGOW, TUSSDAY. A numerous meeting of the shareholders of this bank was held here to-day, Mr. Andrew Orr presiding. The meeting Unanimously agreed that the bank be rezistered in terms of the Joint Stock Bank CompaniesAct, 1857, it beingexplained that the design was not to wind up but to secure the same vantage ground as the chartered banks. The meeting aleo agreed ananimously that a committee of gentlemen uncon. nected with the bank be appointed to investigate its affairs and report to an adjourned meeting on Tuesday next, and that a guarantee fund of half a million be raised to enable the bank to resame business withoutdelay.
TRE KOORIA MOOBIR GUANO ISLANDS. LIVERPOOL, MoN-n&Y. We have been favoured with the following interesting letters:- "The following letter has been received from the master of the Credenda by his owners in Liverpool " Island of Jibleea, October 7. I beg to inform you that the Credenda arrived at the Island of Helaanees on the 9th of September in compan with several other vessels, and the following day lauded, and found a plentiful supply of good fresh water, the south. west monsoon stil blowing strong; and on the 20th of Sep. tember saied for this, and came to anchor on the northeast aide, within a hundred yards of Her Majesty's steam. ship Cordeli. I at once landecd with Mr Staubu ad wi a bag and shovel on each of our shoulders too s session of the largest cave, and am of opinion there w i1be it sufficient to oadtheCredenda, and anothervessel of the snmsheifhere. bnniThereisa large quantity of goodcguano on'th islad, it iwill require a deal of labour, na it Is a long distance tocarry it. It is imDosible to form anyw acn rate estimate of the quantity on this island, but the general opinion is 500,000 hns. It is found good on the plains and not so dam as in the caves. I have already got Iseveraltons on board, and 200tons ready for shipment, i and so soon as Captain Ord returns wlth labonr we shall get on rapidly; he left here for Muscat, on the 4th inst., in an open boat, to engage and bring lab ourers thence. I can give no information re- Hnaski and Ghurzond, no one yet having been oland. I forward this letter by the bark Amicus, which arrived thi morning from Aden with all her crew sick, and the master, finding that he could do nothing for aome time, and his vessel not being chartered, proceeds for Bombay this evening. Samples of the guano from the isand, as well as from thu caves, I forward by this opportunity. I 'am of opinion the vessel will have a good cargo, and hope you will have a vessel or two here to load the remainder of my cave. At the same time consider the guano on the plains as good as that contained in the caves. Having nothing more particunar to add, TI remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant, "WILLL&Ah lFLETT." The following is an extract of a letter addressed to Mr. Joseph Hindson, of Liverpool:- " Muscat, Oct. 9. "My dear Sir, -I left the islands in an open boat on the 4th inst. and reached here on the 9th, with the view of procuring labour, for the want of which we were at a stand. I shall leave for the islands with about 150 strong men, provisions, and some cattle, in a native craft I have chartered for the purpose, and hope to reach theiulandsin10 days hence, by whioh time I hope the natives will have come from MArbat, when we shall commence shippIng the guano on an extensive sale. I left at the islands Her Majesty's ship Cordelia, the merchant ships Virginia, Paxton, Saxon Queen, Oceans, Credenda, and others. " You may be of good cheer, our nrospects are most promising, there are not less than 500,000 tons of good guano, equal to the Upper Peruvian, on the island of Jibleea alone. "JOHN ORD."
TRADE Or SPAI.-We gather the following particulars from the offlclal Consular Report to the Government at home:-The value of the importations into Alicante, in 1856, was 161,2171, consisting chiefly of rails machinery, codfish, coke, and coals, all in British voesls: The exports are valued at 17,2611. only, consisting of almonds, fig-cake, and barilla. The harbour of Valencia is undergoing extensive improvements, and the mole already affords shelter for ships drawing 16 feet water. The import trade in British bottoms is valued at 59,9761,, and the export trade at 15,8951. The general trade of the consular district of Alicante exhibits an increase of 440,7091. in the importations, chiefly caused by the unusual admission of grain, and an increase of 84,8031. in the exports. We turn to Cadiz. 335 British vessels entered this port in 1855, tonnage 66,302; while 213 British vessels cleared out from Cadiz with cargoes amounting in value to 980,7471. 46,282 tons of coals were imported from England. The exports consisted chiefly of Xeres or "sherry" wine whereof 43,389 butts were shipped in 185, besides 118,67- tons of salt. 80 American ships imported tobacco and staves, and exported salt, wine, cork, and liquorice. The French, Belgian, and Dutch vessels imported coals (from England), and exported salt, wine, and dried fruits. The Swedish, Norwegian, and Russiau vessels imported timber and deal, and exported salt and wine. As regards Seville, the Imports in 1856 were 1,282,2451., and the exports, 1,425,9241. In the foreign trade, 194 vessels of 18,636 tons entered the port with cargoes, and 244 of 23,792 tons left it similarly laden. The imports from Great Britain are valued at 180,8661., and the exports to Great Britain at 266,7442. The exports to England included lead, oranges, figs, chestnuts, wheat, oil, cork, wood, copper, and copper ore. Thc average rate of exchange for the year was 51.21d. per hard dollar of 20 reals. An interesting general report on the st%te of Sevile is appended from the pen of Mr. Consul Williams. At Barcelona, 132,720 bales of cotton were imported in 1866 in Spanish vesselA, destined for manufacture in the cotton-mills of the district. The other imports consist of sugar, coffee, cocoa, rurn, cigars, dye-woods, wax, and hides, and the exports of wines, garlic, oil, almonds, nuts, paper, cork, and coarse cotton goods. The goods brought to Barcelona In British bottoms are coals, coke, iron, and railroad materials; the latter, howover, have been inconsiderable. The Spanish or national trade of Barcelona is of great importance. There were, last year, 2,610 arrivals, of 270,025 tons, and 3,718,7201. value of cargoes (exclusive of the dependent ports), and 2,395 departures, of 277,046 tons, and cargoes of 3,216,7701. value. The strong desire to establish cotton factories is much weakened by the liberal and anti-protective fiscal policy of the Spanish Government and the increase of competition. At present there is an unhealthy rage for joint-stock comp es at Barcelona for all kinds of objects. There now exist in the city above 45 such companies, with nominal capitals of 20,000,0001. and paid-up capitals of justone-fourth that amount. Alany of these companies, it is reported, are destined to encounter the fate of a1 baseless speculations but some of them, it appears, contribute largely to facUitate commercial operations by giving them a wider scope, and their stock becomes an advantageous mediumr of currency. The lsut year's crop of wheat in Spain fell short, aud there no longer appears any large available surplus of grain for the supply of foreign countries. Bilboa has also ceased to export wheat, which last year, on the contrary, it largely Imported. It exports chiefly madder and oopper ore, and imports from England machinery, wrought iron, cotton ood and hardware, all of whichh;ive ani Lttols on account of the enormous duty. The provincea of Guipuscos is produxctive of rich ores, especially calamine and blendo. Coal haa not yet boeen found, and the iron is worth nothing. Since the terminaflon of the Carlist civiL. war the industrial progress of Guipuzcoahabenr adIt now possesss mflls and factories of all d V cotton goodapreduced are retortas and d4fantinas (domestics) with printed calicoes. The regular trade of the port of Santander is chiefly with Ctmba, and the produce of the po vince itself Is Indian corn or maize.

LA UNCHEIG TIE LVITLATAN. * The utmost efforts were made during the course of Monday night and yesterday morniijg to get a} ready fir another start in the afternoon, bat from the umavoidable delays caused il i.he dei,very of the hydranlie rams at the yard it was impossible to make further attempts yesterday. Advantage has been taL-en of this pause to niake ii sh arrangementain somerespects forthe nextefforts, and, above all, to do away with the hindrance and loss of timel caused by lengthening the beams by which the force is applied from the hydranlio machines to the crales. Since the breakc down of the 10inch ram on Monday afternoon no less tban five of those machines have been placed at the dispoul of Mr. Brunel. One of these wil be used to replace thd broken one, and two at least of the others will be fixed close to the side of the cradle, leaving two in reserve in case of fresh mishaps. As a number of fresh piles have to be driven to form a base for the two new rams to act against, it wial at the earliest be near noon to-day before another start can be effected. In the meantime, the tides after to.daya? spring. tide will be fast getting lower and lower every hour now lost is of consequence, for every -our lessens the chance of the ship being afloat foe the next two or three weeks to come. We are far from saying that this delay will take place, or even that it is likely to do so, but the chance is quite within probable limits, and it is aa well not to be too sanguine as to imnediate results& Of course, the confident predictions to which this delay has given rise in certain quarters, that thb vesel will never move again from this day till the end of time, are sheer nonsense, and devoid even of the wit with' which the Poplar public have conk trived to embody the same idea in punning dow" her name to the " Leave her high and dry athan." If the shareholders wished, the whole vessel oould be taken bodily to the centre of Blacikheath; but that, of course, would be an expensive trip. A; the matter stands at present, it is a mere questiof of force, and with the additional hydraulic machineb more than enough will be at work to-day to push her across the river, if need be.
UNIVZBSITY INTELLIGENCE. OXFORD, Dxo. 1. In a Convocation held this day at 2 o'clock the statute for the regulation of the Taylor Institution 'was submitte" to the House in foar votes, On the first ard last there wa no division; but the second and third (requiring the Pro; fessor of Modem Languages and the teachers to subscribe the 39 Articles if born British subjects) were oppoeed, and a vote was taken on them. Both were carried-the econd by 58 votes to 23, and the third by 70 votes to 27. In a Congregation held immediately afterwards two forms of statute were promulgated, one for regulating the Craven Scholarships, and the other for making oertaii alterations in the academical costume. After the reading of the former, The Principal of St. MARY HALL (Mx. Chase) rose, and expressed his strong opposition to the statute. He entered at large into the question of the claimns of poverty, which he warmly advocated, and threw great blame on the Council for reintroducing a subject so recently decided by Congregation with an overwhelming majority. He appealed to the advocates. of physical science to, join in oppositiou to te present statute,vwhich Ignored their claims, and called on all upholders of the eleemosynary principle to resist the wiping out of the last spot in the Uiiversity legislation where that prinoiple was acknowledged. The Provost of WORCXSTZR (Dr. Cotton) desired to sug gest that persons before votng should read the regulations drawn uphby the two Lords Craven on which the claims of poverty were founded. They would find them to be very strongly expressed, and to apply alike to founder's kin and other scholars. The Rector of ExxTIm (Dr. Lightfoot) read the reguls. tions as existing at present, which were drawn up when the University accepted the foundation, and showed thit founders' kdn were exempted from the obligation of poverty. He also observed, in reply to Mr. Chase, that a statute abolishing the qualification of poverty in the cae of three out of the five scholars had been passed by lsrge majoritieo, both in Congregation and Convocation. The Provost of WoRoEsTEPR read further extracts from the Wills and Regulations in support of his view. The Master of BATUOL (Dr. Scott) explained that the re. gulations referred to by the Rector of Exeter were final, aud overruled the will of the first Lord Craven. He said that the eleemosynary principle bad never within his experience been attended to. He traced the history of the present atatute, showing that the Council had orsiginally proposed to retain the two old scholarsbips on the present footing, and to make the three founded more recently perfectly open; that the University had accepted this proposition by a large majority, butthatthe comuission hadobjected, refusing to sanction any arrangement which left any of the scholar. ships close; that the commission had themselrvb proeosed a scheme assigning the xcholarships in part to physical science, which scheme the Council had adopted, but the University had thrown it out. The present proposal was the result of an attempt to find a scheme in which the University and the Commission might agree, and he trusted it would be carried. Dr. PuSny observed that the original regulstions of the first Dord Craven were now of no force. Counsers opinlon had decided that they could not be reverted to. HAving been an examiner for the scholarships for 20 years he could testify that in all that time the poverty of candidates had never even been made a subjeot of inquiry. He thought the scholarships should be all open or none, and observed on the increasing number of those who claimed as foundere kin. Mr. 1NEATX, of Oriel, believed the arrangement made by the University with the second Ljord Craven, setting aside the will of the first Lord, to have been wrong in law. HIow. ever that was, poverty continued to be recognized as a claim much later. There was a decree of Chancery in 1819 requiring the devotion of the Craven Fund to the establishment of "ten poor scholars." He did not regad the abolition of the eleemosynary principle in respect of Fellowships as properly ruling the case of scholars. In reply to Dr. Pusey he observed, that poverty ought to have been taken into account by ths examiners. The Warden of ME.RTON (Dr. Marsham) hoped that before a vote was taken the decreo of Chancery referred to by Mr. Neate, and the opinion or opinions spoken of by Dr. PaEey, would be laid before the Congregation. He defended the claiums both of founders' kin and of the poor. Professor CoNINoTON considered that we were now free from the legal question, as we were legislating in conjunction with the comminsioners, who were expressly appointed to relax the obligations of law for us. He thought that Mr. Neste had not answered the argument from the case of colleges, and would have been disposed to regard his opinion as of more weight, had he not known him to have opposed the abolition of the eleemosynary principle even for Fellowships. The aotuel practice in regard to the Craven scholars had long been to pay no attention to the consideration of poverty. He prefered the last form of statute, and had voted for it, being quits willing to assign a portion of the foundation to physical science. He hoped the supporters of physical science wsould not answer to tho appeal of Mr. Chase, hut would vote for the present statute. Professor JowxETr said that he thoroughly approved the statute. If it was thrown out it would be merely for the sake of the shadow of the eleemosynary principle. Mlr. TwEED, of Exeter, proposed an amendment. He would divide the scholarships into senior and junior, the latter to be open to all underg- %duates of one year's standing, and would make them tenable only during residenoe. They would thus help to support real students, which was the nearest approach to the old eleemosynary principle that was practicable in our day. The Principal of ST. MARY-.ALL rose to answer the arguments which had been brought against him, and was proceeding to address the House, when Mr. RASwLINSON, of Exeter, rose to order. As one of those who had been intrusted with the drawing up of the regulations for the proceedings in Congregation, he begged to observe that, while a Person who had spoken once might exlain, he could notreply. W The ViCm-CnANC&MO upholding this, Mr. Chase sat down. Mr. LAE, of Balliol, asked a question wvith respect ko the opinion of counsel spoken of by Dr. Pusey, and sup. ported the statute. Dr. PUSEY ex;lained that the opinion was given by Sir C. Wetherall, and was to the effect that the University could not fall back on the will of the first Lord Craven. The debate then closed The statute on academio costume was then read and promulgated. when a lively and amusing debate took place, of which we can only slightly indicate the general outline. 3Mr. Neate, of Oriel, proposed that the undergraduate govwn should be dispensed with altogether, Mr. Tweed, of Exeter, that the scholars should keep their gown, and the commoners take the gown of the Students of Civil Iaw. Mr. Rogers, of Magdalen-hall, objected to any change in these dresses, but would be glad to see the gentlemen commoners' and noblemen's dress assimilated to that of the commoners. Mr. Riddle, of Balliol, and Mr. Chaffes, of Brasenose, objected to any ohange at all. The twSo Proctors defended the statute. Mr. Lake, of Balliol. objected to the proposed scholars' gown; he would put scholas and commoners in the same dress. tr. Sidebottom, of New College, and the Principal of New Inn Hall, proposed amendments, the former of which we did not catoh. The Principal's amendment was to give the gentleman commoner's gown to commoners, leaving untouched the distinction of the cap. The Congregation was dissolved at about 4 o'clock. The Junior Proctor has issued the list of candidates for responsions in the current term. The number of namex is 107. The Professor of Music (Sir F. A. Gore Oueseyt) intends leoturing in the Musio School on Wednesday, the 9th of Detember, at 2 o'lock; subject, English cathedral music.

A dreadful accident took place yesterday, between 2 and 3 o'clock, at the citadel of Vivcennes. The 5nterior of the entrance tower suddenly fell to the Eround with a tremendous ch, burying in the 3 uins the entire post of the military on guard. q'hese amounted to some 20 men, and the number uf the sufferers was unfortunately augmented by the fact of one of the upper floors being used as a ESalle de Police, where a few soldiers were at the time in confinement. A number of the bodies were extricated from the ruins, but few among the vic. rims tere fouvd alive, and those so terribly inj d that recovery is considered nearly hopeless. She whole of the sufferers had not been reached, 2notwithstanding every exertion, up to last evening, to that there still remained a possibility that the lives of some of those beneath the maes of ruins $night be preserved. Since the foregoing was written I have obtained further particulars respecting this disaster. It appears that the gate of the Fort of Vincennes where 't occurred is one of the oldest parts of the building, its construction going back to the 13th or )14th century.J Since that period the gate ham undergone several important re 'r The roof, which 'was two years ago covered with late, was con'verted into a platform, without any change being made in the main ach. The arch, it is said, then presented an appearance of solidity sufficient to support the works which were necessary for it transformation. It was laid over with sand three feet in depth, 'with a ledge of maaonry all round, in order to fit it to receive artillery. Three miortars and the same number of heavy guns were placed on it, which were afterwards found imbedded 3n the ruins. The gate of the fort was cmposed of three flats raised to some hei'ht, and it was the part which is on the right-hand side as you enter the fort tbat fell in. On the ground floor was the guardhouse of the Engineers; on the first floor was a Salle de Police, on the right a store, and on the first fioor a guardroom. At the woment of the accident the garrison of Vincennes consisted of the 1st and 14th Regiments of Artilery, the 4th and 17th battalions of Foot Ohameurs, and a battalion of the 85th of the Line. Three men of the last-. 3nentioned corps were confined in the guardroom, on the first floor to the right. About a dozen men belonging to the other corps of the garrison were in the guardroom to the left. The guard on duty consisted of an officer, a sergeant, two corporals, a bugler, and about 20 men. The great clock of the' fortresa was striking 2 at the moment the arch gave ,way, and the hands marked the same hour this morning. The corporal on duty was proceeding to relieve the guard, and it is to this circumstance that several of them owe their lives. At 8 o'clock the evening before a corporal of the 85th Regiment 'went to confine two men in the guardroom, where there were already three prisoners, who are among the killed. It happened that, owing, proibably, to the settlement of the tower, the corporal could not open the door of the cell; after various efforts he desisted, and sent his two prisoners to their beds till the next day. It was to this circumstance they owe their escape from death. When the first crash of the falling arch was heard the officer of the guard, who was in his room, tushed out, and the sergeant followed his example, jbut too late. He was swept down by the masses of stone and timber, and remained eight hours in the most critical position before he was released ; he was found to be much bruised, but yet with life. The men who were in the Salle de Police on the first floor to the left were roused from their sleep by the tremendous crash of the building, and, half choked with dust, they dashed at the 'Windows, shouting for help. Ladders were rlanted against the walls, and the bars of the i'indows broken in order to save them, but without much success; the number of victims amounts to 18. The sergeant and corporal were dugout froni the ruins, and taken to the infirmary. They were 3nuch injured, but are not without hope of being saved. The moment the Minister of War received an account of the catastrophe he hurried to the spot, and superintended in person the men who were clearing away the ruins. He remained till 8 o'clock, when It was ascertained that all thebodies were recovered. The Emperor, accomapanied by a single aide de. camp, proceeded at 4 o clock to Vincennes, and remnainedon the spot till half-past 5. Marshal Magnan, the Prefect of Police, the General commanding the garrison of Paris, and a number of other superior officers, also hastened there, anid all exerted themselves actively. The labour of clearing away the ruins lasted tiU 10 at night. It was resfumed this morning, and continued the whole of the day; and at the moment I write a great portion of the four arches that gave way so suddenly has been removed. Tbe dead bodies are lying in the infirmary. They 'will be buried with military honours to-morrow. The Emperor has, I understand, expressed much displeasure at the state 'in which the building must have been for some time. He considers that there was great negligence somewhere. The arch must have been long iu the last state of decay to fall thus suddenly without any immediate impelling cause, and it was the duty of the engineering departmenb to see that the platform was sufficiently strong to support the weight placed upon it. It was in the same fort that M-rabeau spent three years and a half as a prisoner in 1781, having been taken under warrant of a Icttre de cachet, for the third time. It was there that he translated BoccaccIo's Tales, the Baisers de Jeaia Secvad, for the amusement of Sophie de Ruf'ey, wife of the Marquis de Monnier, President of the Chambre des Comptes at Dol; and he also wrote there some original compositions of a licentious character. General Lamrorciere has refused to avail himself of the peri-nsion offered him to return. There were, it seens, certain conditions attached, which, it is iaid, another exiled General advised him not to accept. Madame Lamoricibre has left Paris to join lher husband. It may be remembered that no conditions were exacted from General Leflo on a similar recent occasion; this is explained by the fact that General Lamoriciere is regarded as a man much more stirring, more enterprising, and, in a word, mnore formidable in certain circumstances, than the other. MM. Carnot, Goudchaux, and Henon have announced their determination not to take the oaths as Deputies to the Legislative Body. The reduction by tbe Bankof Franceof I per cent. in its rate of discount has produced a beneficial effect on the comnierce of Paris. This measure is regarded as demonstrative of the comnmercial crisis havig arrived at itY decreasing stage. There is still, however, much pruidence observed among the trading elasses, for according as the close of the year approaches their engagements become more heavy. The month of December is always a difficult period among the merchants, even in the most prosperous tihmes, and a reduction of 1 per cent. in the rate of discount, which leaves it still at 7 per cent. for short bills, is not sufficient so relieve the small tradesmnen, who are compelled to seek such accommodation in order to meet their engagemenuta. As a further measureof relief forthemseives themanufacture of Paris as well as those in the departments have reduced the numoer of their operatives. The shopkeepers on their part have ceased to give orders to the manufacturers. They confine themselves to the renewal of their stocks in small quantities, for which they pay in cash and require a heavy disce;;.+ **'*. Ta-a rerali tracie, which was not very animated amon" the fancy shops in Paris during the month or October, has become more dull during the present month. The shopkeepers, however, live ia hopes that the merry ttine of Christmas may bring theim more customers. Many orders which were given to the manufacturers of the paubourg St. Antoine have been withdraw since the accounts of commercial difficulties in neighbourIng countries reachted Paris. Under these circam- stances tho positioll of the operative clases is not satisfactory, but particularly in the departments, where sonie of the railway companies have suspended their works. The Government, however has not lost sight of this subject, and it is said thai negotiations are at present in progress with the Bank of France to procure for the railway companies the assistance th-y reiluire. It is calculated that the continuation of the works on the princi. pal lines will absorb a sum of 20,000,0001. during the year 1858. It is said that the Bank is ready to advance this sum on condition that it alone shall be emilpowered to issue railway bonds and sell thems whenever the moment may appear favourable. It will advance 50,000,000f., the fifth of the surt! req-i rtcdat the ordinary rate of discount, but it will require that the reoeipts of the comrpaies borrowing be lodged ia the Bank. These conditions appear to the railway companlies more severe than the Bank is justified in imponing. The lodging their receipts in the Bank would deprive the great com aniee of a portion of their revenues,as the Bank of mr e allows no interest on deposits. Many of the railway companies employ their cash in band in loans on the security of Government Rentes, or in deposits which bear interest, until the period arives for the declaration of a dividend, and tbis source of revenue the companies wre not disposed to abandon to the Bank of France. The Northern and Strasburg Companies are said not to require assistance from Government-the one not having occsuion to issue bonds and the other having obtained all the cash it needs. Some other cnmpanies have obtained from private bankers the assistance they require. Under any circumstances, however, it is expected that the companies will be able to resume and continue their works, by which means employmnent.will be found for the operatives in the departments during the season of the year they most require it. Both wheat and flour declined in price last week in the Paris market, but not sufficiently to reduce the average, by which the price of bread is calculated. The price of the two-pound loaf will be raised le. to-morrow, the lat of December. The factors declared in the Paris market on Saturday last 3,568 sacks of flour of the first uaity for delivery within 30 days at rices varying from 46f. to 54f. the sack of 167 kilogrames, average price 49f. 60o. Bakers' flour is only saleable in amall quantities at 48f. to 49f. the sack.

As may well be supposed, the fearful explosion at the fortiress of MIayence, of which the Ptrince of Prussia is commander, has produced a most lively and painful sensation here, and even from this distance numbers of persons flock to the scene of the catastrophe to wie es with their own eyes the extent and nature of the disawter. Immediately on the arrival here of the ad newhs, the Prince of Prussia sent off Colonel von Alvensleben to the spot to inquire into the real state of the case, taking with him b,000 oersns from himself and the Princess, with a view of assisting those most in neede The result of Colonel von Ailvensleben's report on his return thence was, that the Prince Immediately ordered the Minister of Finance to forward 10,000 thalers out of the State resources towards the relief of the distressed. A committee of very inwuential men has been formed for the purpose of coectig subscriptions throughout the country towards the same end; and the town of Dantzlc, in recollection of a similar catastrophe that befell itsell: 41 years ago, has at once voted 2,000 thalers. The Grand Duke of Hetfen, who was at a very early period on the spot, has presented the town with 2,000 forens to which some of the youDg Princes of Eesoln have added 500. In Paris, the Hessian Minister has opened a subsoription among the Germans there, and headed it with 500 francs, ani in this example he is being followed by most of the Hessian consuls throughout France, tbelgium, ad the Netherlands. Of the very liberal subscriptionsin Vienna, with the Emperor at the head, you have doubtless heard direct. In the midst of the grief and regret at the fearful extent of the disaster, there is a strong under-current of satisfaction here that it was not a Prtuian hand that firedlte train, nor a Prussian officer by whose carelessnes the ke of the powder-magazine becam e liable to abstraction. Such are the jealousy and aversion of the two brother nations of Germanythat even an actident of this nature cannot be left without giving rise to al sorts of invidious imputations, and no sooner was the news of the powder having exploded in the newspapers than the statement was at the sama time launched that it was Prussian artillerymen who had done it. The removal from Potsdai to Charlottenburg has been effected without any injurious consequences to the :King, and he continues to take longer and longer drives every day, and even on the same day to walk for some little time in addition. It appears, however, to be pretty generally understood that in the course of January the King will carry out the original plan of repairing to a more southernly climate, and that the powers intrusted to the Prince of Prussia willbe prolonged beyond the three months originally appointed, and which will expire on the 23d of that month. The Prince and Princess of Prussia are recovering rapidly from the influenza, wvich has assumed a less malignant character generally throughout the town, im consequence of mild and rany weather having supervened. Prince Friedrich Wilhelm is expected back here on the 3d of December. The Hereditary Grand Duchess of MecldenburgStrelitz (Princess Augusta of Cambridge) passed through here yesterday with the Grand Duke on their way home to Strelits from Paris, where the latter has been undergoing the treatment of an oculist. The Grand Duchess went on foot to visit the Princess of Prussia, while the Grand Duke proceeded to pay his respects to the King and Queen at Charlottenburg. The KiDg of Hanover passed through here the day before yesterday, also on his way to Strelitz, The storm of the money crisis, which has already worked such devastation in the commercial circles of New York and London, has as yet only caused here a few dry leaves and rotten tWigs to fall to the ground, which had no life and tenacity of their own. The houses that have as yet stopped payment are for the most part cotton spinners and calico printers, and they have dragged down after tbem a number of drysalters; but there are hardly any names of note worth mention as yet. The necessity of taking fiteps to ward off the approaching money crisis from this market brings into fulU light the faulty principles upon which monetary matters are managed here. For instance, the rate of interest for loans of money on securities, whether stook, shares, or goods, called here "Lombard," is fiaed by the usury laws at 6 per cent.; money being now worth so much more for discounting purposes,the Bank has for a long time been fighting shy of all fresh Lombard loans, and, where it was possi- ble, has even called in those that were outstanding. The large class, therefore, of speculators in produce -for instance, manufacturers who have laid in large stocks of raw materal-were thurs deprived of their usual resource, and sent to look for relief from discounts at a much higher rate. This resource, however, is little more than kiteflying and the getting up of accommodation bills; for, 4s the Bank requires three names to every bill, ordinary trade bills drawn by the seller on the buyer were of no avail, no one being willing in times of general distrust to lend his nime as endorser for any c6nmmilson however high. Every man in want of accommodation must now soek outt wo others equally in need with himself, aud so for mutual assistance they draw on each other, and accept and endorse all round. This resource is speedily found insudcient to produce eae ;for, as the Bankis the only institation for discounting, it is woon found out if pig, pork, and bacon are ringing the changes on each other to any extent; and so the Minister of Commerce, in his desire to provide accommodation, has taken a stop that has always been avoided hitherto as one unjustifiable by any bound principle of banking. He has authorized the Bank to make advances on manufactured goods, precisely the class of secwrity repudiated hitherto in Lombard business, not only on account of the difficulty of ascertaining the intrinsic value of the goods, but also because it is an incentive to manufa,turen to continue producing when there is no demand; and because the possesion of any large stock of manufactared goods on hand that cau be dispensed with for many months is primi facie evidence of mismanagement or unsaleableness. The ligh rate of discount for bills had been fixed with a view to restricting speculation and keeping specie in the land; this extension of loans to manufactured goods neutralizes the former good measure, and confers facilities in a very questionable manner. While the Minister was stretching his authority to make this deviation from usage, he might have takenthebolder and more wholesome step of dispensing witho the third name of the bill for discount, but instructed I that care should be taken to confine the discount to trade bills, and this would have eased the manufacturer who is in a large way of business, and manages it well. The present step does not. One of the largest drysaltery house that has failed here is that of Palmie, Brothers for about 1,400,000 thalers, with biltobligatlons to the exteat of one million. Among the cloth manufacturers about the largest failure Is that of Julius Cohn, the amount of whose liabilities cannot ai yet be stated, inamuch as it is known that he has forged largely, and has already put an end to his life by blownmg out his brains. This individual, vho stood very high in commercial esteem, had borrowed from a lithographer of this place some blank check forms, on pretence of choosing between them and ordering some to be printed for himself. One of these he filled up in the name of a highly respected banker for 18,000 thalers, and got it cashed by the cashier of a banking-house in which he hielf had an account, and was also a member of the committee of discounting. A large house in the corn trade here and at Stettin, H. Moses, has failed for 1,200,000 thalers, and has pulled down with it the house of Behrendt Rosen, mi Hamburg, and it Is feare will very seriously affect many other houses hare and in Stettin. A banker in Stettin, nameed Alex Raup, has failed for 800,000 thalers, but it is understood that his estate will wind up well. In that town alo an attempt is being made to get up a Credit Assurance Society, in imitation of the oteps taken with so much effect in Hamburg and in Stockholm; but it appears that the numerows difficulties and obstacles interposed by Prussian legislatioa and administration in the way of creating anything will| prevent any result being attained from this enldeavour. N!ovmszn 29. My remaPis of yesterday on the legislation and governmnent of this country with respect to monetary matters received the same evening their most ample confirmation by the pulblication of an order, signed by the Prince of Prussia in the name of the Riing, and countersigned by all the Ministers, enacting the suspension of the usury laws for the space of three months, dating from the day before, but, at the same time, forbidding engagements to be entered into for a higher rate than the normal of interest for a longer period than a yer. The d,¶taas Ausier of yesterday also contained an article on the subject, explaining the conduct of the Government in this matter, and enunciating none but the correctest principles in monetary matters, in spite of the very faalty practice that has hitherto prevailed. This article of the .9taats 237eger shows, in conformity with my yesterday's statement .-1. That the restriction of the rate of mnterest for loans on secUrity to 6 per cent, per annum, fixed by the wsury laws, had of late put a atop to the Banlk's making advances on sec.urity, money being worth so much more for the discount of bills, which, not being restricted by the usury law to 6 per cent., is now 8 per cent. 2. The Bank law requiring three names to every biUl offered for discount has had the effect at this period of distrust of actually diminishing the amount of discount accommodation extended to the public;the amount of bilUs offered to and discounted by the BWank having actually become smaller than usual of late, wrhile the requirements of the public have been daily increasing, the paper circulation of the Bank has decreased, and its specie in hand increased; and all this while the necessity of sustaining credit and alleviating the pressure for money waS uncontested. The permissaion which the Mini-ster of Commerce had a few days back given to the Bank to make advances onl manufactured goods has doubWess been found to be inoperative from the unwillingess of that institution to part with nt ony at a rate lower than the market price (bhaving been bound hitherto by the usury laws to charge no more than 6 per cent.); and, moreover, that will hardly have escaped notice which I pointed out yesterday, that, in whatever degree this permission is acted on, it weak-ens the effect of the very judicious rise in the rate of dicount (now 8 per cent.), inasmuch as it admits a large amount of very questionable securities into the money-market at 6 per cent. This suspension of the usury laws at this period ox increased demand for money, the very moment when, according to the false moral of these laws, rapacity is most likely to takre advantage of need, and therefore3 requires to be restrained by law, is a practical acknowvledgment that the restriction of the rate oF interest to a low percentage by law does in practice make money dear to those in want of it, for it drives capital away from its legitiimate field, commerce, and compels it to seek for more profitable employment in speculations on the StockEx;chanlge or in illegal loan transactions. These laws, which have hitherto injured the whole tradAing community by making capital scarce, while they benefitted the Government alone in its loan operations by retainling a low nominal quotation for money, have, together with the anumerous restrictive measures of the State, the Zollverein, the police, and the guilds, put such a strait-waistcoat on commerce and manufactures, that numerous branches, more particularly of the latter, are making little or no progress, and prices, instead of sinking from, im- proved processes of production and competition, are continuaUy rising, while the quality and quantity of the products remain stationary. The consequence is, as I have mentioned more than once of late, that the prices of most things, necessaries of life, are dearer here than in London. On the other hand, toy, knickknacks, and all the fiddle-faddle of art industry, are infinitely cheaper and better here than in London. The same, as regards cheapness, is the case with aU articles of luxury, such as wines, servants' wages, public amusements, jewelry, &c.; so that the rich, who form an inconceivably small minority of the public here, are infinitely better off than in England, while persons of smal income find most things they want dearer here than in England, and many that they wish for not to be had at all. As was also the case this time last year, the Government has allotted 250,000 thalers out of its disposahle funds for the payment of douceurs to its very ill-paid civil servants at the approaching season of Christmas, when the waants of families are most numerous. With a view to the increase of this sum previous to distribution, the various Ministers have issued orders to aU the boards -belonging to their departments to contribute aU the small amounts they may have been able to save during the past year out of the sums voted to them by the House of Deputies, together with all waifs and strays that may have fallen in in the way of fines or extraordinary and unexpected receipts. Towards this same fund also the Prince of Prussia has just ordered that 25 per cent; of the amount shal be contributed whlch the (Government derives every year from the sale of its waste paper. In every public office not only are the documents sorted out carefully that have become obsolete from lapse of time, but also those which have fulfilled some transient purpose, and farther, aU letters not requiring to be kept are eancelled and cut up into shreds for sale to papermakers ; even the envelopes of letters are carefully added to this atore after catting off the sealing-wax, which in separated and melted up for use a second time. The Dantsic firm which was spoken of here yesterday and the day before as having suspended is the house of J. J. Joel, the liabilities of which are estimated, though probably too highly, at three millions of thalerm Three houses of good standing in this place are hinted at as likely to be involved in this breakdown. A fourth house, doing commission business, that failed here yesterday, is without any connexion with the failure of Joel, or of any importance at all. Professor Ranch, the Nestor of the Prumian sculptors, is just now so ill as to leave but small hopes of his recovery. He bad proceeded to Dresden with a view to undergoing a lithotomic operation. The fatigues of the Journey, however, have been too much for him at his advanced age, and the surgeons have been unwilling to proceed with the operation. He has, since then, fallen so seriously ill as to make it desirable for his relatives here to repair at once to Dresden. ITALY. (,aox oUR oWN 0o0RMrolDIr.) TUllIl, Nov. 28. The act of accusation against the Genoese conspirators is extended to a great length by a host of detais, relating to the preparations for, and incidents of, the attempt of the 29th of June. These details comprise little of general interest that was not made public within a short time after the failure of the plot. Mim White is not named in the document, but is referred to as a young Englishwoman who arrived in Genoa from London, preceded by prodigal encomiumain the newspaper Jtelia dei P&Rolo. She said that she came for the study of literature; meanwhile, she surrounded herself with members of t'he Workmen'a Society, to which belongednearly all the persons now accused, and lodged in the house of a hatter, Luigi Roggero, a chief of the society, and one of those conspirators who escaped. It is further stated, that the lady in question attended meetings of the society, and spokce in favour of the' Bepublic, and that she took charge of sums raised by subscription for the purchase of arms. From. the act of accusation it wrould appear that there were abundant grounds forbringing her to trial, and her release must, doubtless, be attributed to unwillingness on the part of this Government to act severely towards a deluded and misguided woman, the native of a friendly country, where certainly the insane attempt she participated in has found no sympathy. Full particulars are given of the arms and ammunition found in numerous places of concealment, in various warehouses and dwelling-houes in and near Genoa, and in a cave of Mount Portofino. The total number of these arms was very considerable, and there were also found carpentering and engineering tools, ladders, and bags of powder with fnus attached, prepared for blo W- ing in gates. Among the arms were some hundred daggers, and triangular files ground into poniards. In one of these dep6ts was found a written paper, which I think was published at the time, denouncing the house of the Peragallo famly as the first to be ?acked, its inmates being spies and cruel enemies of liberty. The memorandum ends with the words " Pillage and Fire I Courage I" Mention is also made of preparations for breaking, from an adjacent house, into the prison of San Andrea, and of the devices resorted to by the conspirators to induce people to join them; also of the trace left by the plotters in the houses where they had heli their meeting; such as candle-ends, fragments of bread, and two wine casks nearly empty, but which a wineseller declared that he had delivered on the evening of the outbreak quite full, whence it would appear that conspiring is thirstv work. Row feebly and clumsily, notwithstandinag these inspiriting potations, the attempt was made, and how signally it failed, is alreadv well known. The day before yesterday Count Mamiani took possession of the new chair of Philosophy of History established in this University, and inaugurated the course by a lecture, which was listened to by a crowded audience, including many persons of distinction. Passages of his discourse, in which he spoke of the Inquisition and the massacre of St. Batholomew, with reference to religious intolerance, were evidently taken by his hearers to possess at this moment a certain political meaning and opportuneness, and elicited much applause. With respect to the last elections there is not much to add to the information that has already been transmitted to you. It is thought possible that Count Revel may still sit in the new Chamber. One of the retrograde deputies returned for Genoa having been also elected for another place, will, it is said, choose to sit for the latter and leave a seat open at Genoa for Count Revel, who would doubtless obtain it. The Genoese, in their usual spirit of opposition to Turin, would probably be pleased at the opportunity of reversing the judgment of the capital, and of restoring to the Parliamentary OpPDOsition one of its best men-a man generally esteemed, even by those who dislike him as a politician. Tt may be remarked as rather curious that in the elections of 1853 Brofferio, rejected at Turin, was chosen at Genoa, while Revel was returned for the capital without opposition. In 1857 Turin prefers Brofferio to Revel, who perhaps wiU get in at Genoa. Of the Liberal deputies whose exclusion from the present Chamber was regretfully predicted by some of your contemporaries, Count Mamiani, as you are aware, has been returned. Parini was rejected, but I understand that his successful opponent (also a Liberal) is under the legal age, so that there wil be another election, in which case Farini's return is thought pretty secure. The clericals, having no chance of bringing in a candidate of their own for that college, supported the new man against Signor Farini. Signor Gallenga's name I have notheard mentioned as put forward for any place. A great many elections wiU be attacked when the Chamber meets, on the ground of illegality or irregularity. The Ministerialists expect to unseat many of their adversaries-among other, the Marquis Birago, editor of the Armwia, who was returned for Strambino. On the other hand, I hear that the clericals, who are quite as loud in their denunciations of Government pressure as their political enemies are in that of Driestlyinfluence and unfair tricks, will attack the election of Signor Lanza, the Minister of Public Works, and also, it is said, that of Count Cavoiir-the latter on the ground of some vote having been taken too late. Cavour was elected by so enormous a majority, and his re-election, if unseated, would be so certain, that it would be merely a vexatious proceeding to take advantage of a slight legal Irregularity.
THE LATE LIEJTENAHT SALKRLD. Our readers will learn with mtuch regret the death o Lieutenant Philip Salkeld, of the Bengal Engineers, who recently displayed such daring and gallantry in firing the siege train at the Cashmere-gate of Delhi. He graduaUy 5nnk under the wounds which he received on that occasion, and died at Delhi about the 10th efOctober. Philip Salkeld was a Dorsetshire man by connexion and parentage. His father was the Rev. R. Salkeld, who was some years ago resident at Servan, lRe et Viatne, and his son was born on the 13th of October, 1830, so that at tho time of his death he had only just completed the 27th year of his age. He obtained his nomination to the service from the late Mr. WiUiam Astell, father of one of the present directors of the East India Company, and received his early education at the Royal Military College of Addiscomba where he was selected for the Engineers in 1S47, and presented at the same time with the highest prizes in mathematics and French. On quitting Addiscombe he went to the Royal Engineer Establishment at Chatham, -where he rernained for nearly two years studying the theory of engineeting and fortification. He quitted. that institution ina January. 1850, and arrived at Calcutta in the following Jane, when he joined the corps of Sappers and Miners. In June, 1853, he was selected to officiate as executive engineer at Meerat, and in the followiniT November was transferred to the charge of the Grand Trunk.road, on which he was continually employed down to December last, when he uneceeded to the office of executive engineer of the Delhi division. He joined the force before Delhi shortly after the (teath of General Anson, and was specially thanked by General Sir Archdale Wilson for his daring exploit in bloxv ing open the Cashmere-gate-an operation equally difficzlt and dangerons, and for which he was rewarded on the spbt with the Victoria Cross. We deeply regret that tb' iat6e of Fo able, intrepid, and promising an officer as Lieutensot Salkeld should have been added to the already long list bf those who have paid their lives as the price of suppressipg the Indian mutiny and of re-establisbing our Indian empire on what, we trast, will prove even a firmer basis than lefore.

JUDiCIAL COMMITlBEAB of the PRIY COUNCzL Deo*hfr 1. HOCOfJA1RD V. Tnvw OrT THl 1ZWPORT. (Before 'Lord Jusiice K2nT BRUOE, LorI Justice TuirI 2R lDr. LuSHINOTON, and Jtr_PZw'Tof IErn. ±-m wags an appeac crom tne aecition of the Judge of the X Vice-Admiralty Court at St. Helena. decreeing theforfeiture I of a vessel called the Newport, of Jeris, for having been engrged In the slave trade, contrary to the provitSons of the 5th of George IV, chap. 113, and also condemning Messrs. ,Pinto, Perez, and Co., werobants of LoAdon, the shi,opers I of thecargo ol board the Newport, in penalties to the I amount of 12 9151. 17s. 6dL, double the value of the cargo, -and ordering the Catgo to be hild in deposit until such penalties were paid, The ship was the property of Mlessr. Lo Sueur, of Jersey, and onthe9tlcofJane, 1854, was char. tered throughMessrs. Bannerand o., hipbrokers,byMessrs. Pinto and Co., to carry a cargo ct lawful goods to Ambriz, on the west coast of Africa, and thence, if required, to Loando, and to reload at either or both of thoae gl,ces a homeward cargo of lawful merchandise, with w ioh she was to return to London. The cargo was thipped byMears. Pinto and Co., in pursuance of an artanement with Mr. Garrido, as the agent of Senor Elores, a Portuguese nercbant carrying on buslnesss at Loander- and they effected an insuratce on this and other return argoe to the amount of 20,000b In Jine, 1854, the Newport sailed on her voya with a general cogo, consisting of cotton, a number of niceillaneous articles, .nd 100 packs, a oask of rivets, 120. bundles of iron-hooping, and 1,00 demijohns, The packs, rlvets, and iron-hooping are materials used in the constructton of casks, and the demijohns are stone or glass vesels of a pecular xpe, used for holding liquor. By the bil of lading the good -were consigued to Francisco Atonro Florers, and all the articles of which the cargo consisted were specified in the bill of lading, in the lnvoices, and k the manifest. On the 21st of September, the Newport, in the proscutlon of her voyg, arsived within 12 miles of Ambriz, when she wra seezet by Har Majesty's sloop Philamel, Captain Skene, and after touching at Loando was carried to St. Hlena, where she arrived on the 9Nh of October. On the 19th of October a monition issued against ChArles Philp Hocqu3rd, the master, and Messrs. Le Suitr, the owners of the ship, in special, and all persons In general having an interest in the ship or her caro. Hocquard tbereupon put in a claim on behalf of himself and of the ownvers, as well as on behalf of Mes Pitto, Perez, and Co., whom he erroneousy supposed to be the legal owners of the cargo, they beitn only the Ahippers On the 20th of November the Vice-Admiralty Court decreed the forfeiture of the vessel, and the condemnation of Memrs. Pinto and Co. in penalties. The vessol was subsequently sold, and the cargo landed and held in deposit. The decree was appealed against first by Mess. LA Sneur; the owners of the vessel; secondly, by Messrs Pinto Perez, and Co., *ho had been allowed to intervene for the protection of their interests; and, thirdly, by Senor Flores, who put in a, cblm to the cargo The Crown, on the other hand, prayed that tbeir Lordsh}pe would report against the appeal, and pronoumoe that the sentenoe appoaled from should be affirmed, the princdpal cause retained, the cargo condemned, and the appellant and interveners oondemned in the costs of the appeaL Sir F. Thesiger, Ar. Forsyth, Q.C., and Dr. Twiss appeared for the appellants; the Queen's Advocate, the Attorney-'General, and Dr. Jenmer for the Crown. Sir. F. THEsIGIR opened th case on tho part of the appellants, and commenced by submitting that, as the Crown had put in a further prayer on the 27th nIt. " to report againat the claim of Mores, and also that the said Floree should be condemned in penalties," their Lordships would give his learned friend Dr. Twiss, who appeared for Fores, an oportunity of addressing them. Thecase of Flores was totally different from that of Pinto and Co. No condemnation of the cargo could legally take place, inasmuch as it did not belong to the shipper, "Martigny v. the Queen " (2 Moore, p. 15), but if the Crown could be heard for the condemnation of the cargo, Flores was entitled to be heard against It. Their LoRDsHms reseved their deolsion upon the poiat until a later stage of the argument. Sir F. THESIGER proceeded with his argunent on behalf of Mlessrs. Le Saeur and of Pinto, Perez, and Co, whose cases, he sad, he would take separately. The only ground upon which Captain Skene justified his seizure of the Newport was, that she had no certificate that a bond had been given to the Customs' authorities that the "packs" or " shooks" and demijohes in her cargo were to be used for lawful purposes. The Act by which bonds were required to be given to the Customs' authorities that certain artioles, including watercasba, were to be used for lawful purposes vas the 6th and 7th of William IV., cap. 6, which recited a treaty between Hs Majesty and the Spanish Government for the abolition of the slave trade. He con. tended that that Act did n )t apply to this particular case. The intention of the Act was to provide for the execution of the treaty, and it enacted that, under certain circumstanoes, vessels should be taken before courts of mixed oommission. It applied to cases of English vessels seized by foreign cruisers, and of foreign vessels seized by English cruisers;. but it could not apply to the case of an English vessel taken by an English cruiser to an English Court of Admiralty. But, even if the Act did apply to such a case, the Newport did not come within its provisions. Thearticles mentioned in the Act were to be taken as a rnin4 facie evidence that the vessel was engaged in unlawful traffio if they formed part of the " outfit or equipment" of the vessel, not if, asin the present case, they formed part of the cargo. The bond was only to be given wlhen an extraordinary quantity of articles of this description was put on board as part of the outfit or equipment. A similar distinction was drawn between cargo and equipment in the 10th article of the treaty. No bond or certificate was necessary if they formed part of the cargo or were mentioned as such in the ship's papes In the prewent case the articles were invoiced to Flores and entered in the manifest, and it could not be contended that any bond was required in respect of them. Captain Skene's only ground for making the seizure, the absence of the certificate that such a bond had been given, therefore whoUy failed. He should next contend that tho articles on hoard the Newport did not come either within the intention or the words of the Act. In considering that question it was important to ascertain the usual practice of the Customs as to the articles in respect of which bonds were required. Since the affair of the Newport the Lords of the Treasury had directed bonds to be taken and oertificates to be granted in respect of materials for casks. In pursuanco of those directions the form of bond wrs altered in January, 1857, and for the first time staves, iron hoops, and iron rivets were mentioned in it. The learned counsel then read passages from the evidence of several Custom-house offioers and African merchants, who had been examined for the purpose of showing that the practice of the Customs in regard to taking bonds in respect of materiahls for casks, staves, demijohns, and other vessels of the same kind, was very fiuctuating up to that period. There were frequent instances of casks and demijohns having been cleared without bonds when they formed part of a cargo. The shippers of this cargo, then, could not be charged with negligence in not having give bonds, no such bonds havng been demanded. Yet the absence of a certificate that bonds had been given was the only ground upon which the seizure was justified. Tbere was not the least evidence that the owners had the slightest intention of allowing their vessel to be engaged in the slave trade, or that they had any knowledge that It would be devoted to other than lawful traffic. In their answers to the interrogatorles both the owners of the vessel and Messrs. Pinto and Co. distinctly denied that they had any suspicion that the ves;el or the cargo was to be used for any unlawful purpose. The terms of the charterparty, too, wholly rebutted any such notion. There was not a single fact in the case sufficient to raise anything amounting to a suspicion on the part of Messrs. Le Sueur that an intention ensted of employing their vessel in the sLave trade. He would now proceed to the case of Pinto, Perez, and Co., who had been decreed to pay enormous penalties on the ground of their having been engaged in a contract connected with the slave trade. The first point upon rhich he should take their Lordships' opinion in this part of the case was whether the Judge of the Vice-Admiralty Court had power to decree any penaties at alL He submitted that the 5th of George IV., Cap. 113. under which the learned judge claimed to exercise jurisdiction, gave him no such power. Penalties could only be recovered under that Act in a Court of Vice-Admiralty in any part of lHer Majesty's dominions wherein the offence was committed, or where the offender might be found after the commission of such offence. Now, if any offence had been oommitted in this case It was committed at the place where the cargo was put on board, and certainly the offenders, Perez, Plnto, and Co., were not found at St. Helena after the commission of the offence. The only subsequent Act under which the learned judge could claim to exercise jurisdiction was the 8th and gth of Victoria, cap. 93, which certainly gave him no power to impose these penalties. But even if the judge had j risdiction, he had violated All the rules laid down byf the Privy Council under tbe 2d of WillIam IV., cap. 51, for the conduct of proceedings in the courts of Vioe-Admiralty. On the 25th of June, 1851, an order In Council was issued for the regulation of the Vioe-Admiralty Court of St. Helena. That order prohibited the imposition of penalties when a monition was generaL Now, the monition In this case was general. and did not mention the nmxes of Pinto, Perez, and Co. HEe could not conceive upon what ground the Crown could contend that those penalties ougbt to be enforced. The monition was dated the 19th Octooer, aud the sentence decreeing these penalties was pronounced on the 10th Novembez. However, as Pinto, Perez, and Co. had now intervened, and their Lordships might perhap be of opinion that the judge was justified in imposing these penalties, he must call their attention to the utter disregard of all the rules which ought to be observed in the oonduct of criminil Proceedings manifested by the Court below. On the 14th December, 1854, a lettetr was written by the Judge of the Vie Admiralty Court, Mr. Salomons, to Lord Clarendon, giving an abstract of the ease, and explaining the grounds of his decision. In the course of that letter Mr. Saloruons said- "In tbehe transat-as a cereon named Garrido appeams to hawe acOed s gent for ierres; son this man is xald atro to have beea actively engago4 ii the slave tr.de for many years. until he became hankrnPt and to hae been since employed going to and from Aldz London.

But he contended that the evidence was wbolly insufficient io snpport the inferences upon which the judge hsd prooeeded. The judge had no materials before him for forming an opinion &sto Elores, except the belief of Lieutenant de Bobeck, fonded upon genetal information that he hed receiveda from. tex persona. Sir F. Theniger then oomplained warmly o.f the course pursued by the Crown in eatiW Inputstionis Upon 3letars. Pinto and Co., Whofor 30yea.s lad erriedo buon ness without reproach, and were now charged with embu;kiDg In this odious trade in order to obtain exorbitant raing Ilethoughtthat,afbteressrst Pintoand Co. haa proved t1ir web engaged in comrrce ol l b.raverer would have been becoming In beo M,,if tto Wevretired from the case, at lemt to have admitted that Messrs. Pinto And Co. had completely exoneratd them"lYO But the brwi ad admitted evidenlce which was wholly inamissi. hle, in order to produce an e nhvotinlle impression upon the' minds of those who were to decide tihiemase upoas. Pinto and Perez had proed that they were unacquainted with Flores until 1852, when he wrote to them upon the Introduction of Md. Gaido, ewho had at one thus been ein- yloed as a clerk in the house of Mr. Pinto'n father and VrotheratbLsbon; tbat ealeetransactionstook lace between them and that ultimately they received 10,OO1. on acconr of Flores, with wbich they purchased a cago of Manchester goods and despatched It by the Dedander to the west coast of Africa. It was alleged on the part of the Crown that this cargo oonsisted of goods generally used in the Slave trade, but it w"a of the satna desdciption as the cargo after. wards sent by the Newport. The goods were such as were generally nsed for the p2poes of atwful traffic, and, even supposing that Flores or hIi agent did purchase slaves with it, Messrs. Pinto and Co. had not the least reaoon to auspeot that it was shipped with that object. If Flores and Garido wero tbe most notorious slave trafokers in the world, were they therefore to be precluded from ever engaging in lawful commeree? Anotherpro-ofthat MemsrPinto and Cowere free from suspicion was that in 1854 when Garridofdiii arrived in London, he applied to another firm-Cater, lnmian, and Co.-to enter into transacionis with Flores in stead of Pinto and Co, andat was only upon Cater and Co;.' refusal, out of delicac to Pinto and Co., and upon thei,r,,rr &noe of the respectailitY of Pinto and Co., that Garrido applleatothem. Ifit&do,abencpi4dn= former transctions of an illegal kind, would Grrido hxve gone to Cater and Co., sud Made this proposition? Being satiEfied with the information be had received as to their respectability, Garrido returned to them and continued to do busness with them. This crcumstaca entirely dis. proved the suspicion that previous to that period, at any rate, they had been engaged with Garrido in an unlawful undertaking. Itwassubsequenttothisthat thebrokersof theNewport,bearing tbAtPinto and Co. were shipping goodg for Africa, proposed charter to them en befalf of the owners. They did not eek out the ship, but the ship was offered to them. Their Lordship' attention would next be directed to the documents, lione of which gave the slightest Intimation that ay unlawful trafflo was intended either b Pinto and Co., or even by Flores. The invoices, the bills of lading, and the manest were perfectly regular. Some letters were found on board the veeml from Guarrido to Folres, and even those letters were perfectly consistent with the case of Messrs. Pinto, and contained no trace of any improper transaction. But were these dealings a mere cover for llegaltrading? That they were not wva proved by the cours of dealing between the parties. It appeared from the evidence that in return for the cargoes sent oat Pinto and Co. received cargoes of palm oil, fish oil, nuts, and other Afrinon produoe and that since 1852, when they began dealing with iEores, they had received several Lord Justice KNrGHT BBUCL-You appear to me to be stating rather too good a cue. I am suspecting it all alonog. Sir FRnRxmiC TESIGER.-That was the disadvantage of a good case. This was such a serions charge against a mercantile firm that he oould hardly express the earnestness with which he wished to exonerate them from the least suspicion. The Crown appeared to have adopted the rca soning, or rather the conclusions, of the judge of the court below. They relied upon the notoriety of the connexion of Flores with the slave trade, and tbey alleged that Amebriz was a place notorious for slave trading, andthat the cargo was one which eould only be used for slave barter. Messrs. Pinto, however, denied that they knew Ambrix to be a slave trading plaee, and there was evidence that three English houses had agents at Ambriz, and imported goods to England. As to the cargo, there was abundant evidence that it consisted of goods oommonly abipped to the coast of West Africa for the purpose of lawful commerce. Captain Skene himself admitted that the cargo would have found amarket among lawful traders, and Sir George Jackson, the Chief Commissioner, said there was nothing in the specification ef the cargo to indicate that it was intended for unlawful purposes, Some of the witnesses drew a distinction between the rest of the eargo and the demijohns, but Mr. Swanzy and other African merchants said that demijobns were a common article of trade. Vith regard to the packs, rivets, and iron hooping, materials ued in making casks, it was proved that those articles were commonly sent to Africa, and made up into casks on the coast for the purpose of importing palm oil in them. Thes materials, too, were second-hand, as for the purpose of holding oil they were preferable to new. Before concluding he could not refrain from again complaining of the latitude taken by the Crown in regard to some of the questions put to witnese. Questions had been put of a most insulting character, and wholly irrelevant to the inquiry. The learned gentleman then referred to some interrogatorles put with respect to a ship called the Black Cat, imputing to Messrs. Pinto an intention to deceive the Government in respect to that ship, and also read the explanations of Messrs Pinto on the subject. Lord Justice K1 GRT BRUCS said it was cerinly hard to oblige those gentlemen to go into cases whioh had nothing to do with the matter at issue. The questions respecting the Black Cat were entirely irrelevant. Sir F. THGsrn, in conclusion, submitted that as far as the owners of the vessel were concerned the seizure ws quite unwarranted, inasmuch as there was no necessity for ny bond in respect of the articles on board, and there was not the slightest pretence for imputing that the vessel was engaged in the slave trzade; that, as far as Mess 'into were concerned, the judge of the Admiralty Court bad no jurisdlction to entertain the question of their liability to penalties; but if even ho had jurisdiction, he had not exercised it according to the prescribed regulations; and that if their Lordship3 entered into the merits of the case they would find nothing from the beginning to the end of these transactions to indicate that Messrs Pinto were engaged in anything hut a lawful adventure. Mr. FoRsVrT followed on the same side. but before the conolusion of the arguments on behalt of the appellanis Their LoeDsEps adjourned.
rAW BEPORT. COURT OF Q1JES BENCR. Wmwm- Th a WELLS V. v7ARY- fb<UW9at NisPrius, before Lord CAmPB'LL a'nd Cara. mon Jurics.l mr. ±ienry James appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serieant Thomas for the defendant. This was an action in which the plaintiff, John Wells, a "utcher, near Tottenham-cour-road, sued the defendant, Charles Geary, a cheesemonger, In the same neighbourhood, to recover the snm of 221., under the count for money lent and upon an acconnt stated. It appeared from the plaintiff's evidence that in April, 1856, he had lent the defendant the sum of 251 Some payments had been made, and in .TAnnary, 1857, the parties had met and come to a settlement; and the defendant then gave the plaintiff an I 0 U for 221., which was the sum the plaintiff now sought to recover. Mr. Serjeant THot.%us asked the plaintiff whether the arrangement mazde in January was not reduoed to writing? The plaintiff said there was an agreement signed. Mr. Serjeant THoMAs submitted that the I 0 U was not evidence unless the agreement wsas put in. Lord CAxPBELL overruled the objection The learned SMsIrsuT then called the defendant, who stated thxt when the arrangement wa2 made in January only 171. was due to the plaintiff, the sum of 87. having heen paid at the sa-me interview. He said he had given the plaintiff the I Ol 0for 221. not because that sum was due, but because the plaintiff insisted upon his so doing; but upon the distinct rnderstanding that he was not to be sued or pressed for the money. Mr. JeTAs, upon this, put in a paper which the defendant had signed in April, 1856, acknowledgin the receipt of 101., part of a sum of 251., which the pl0itiff had agreed to lend him at 20 per cent. interest; and also the agreement made at the settlement in January, 1857, in which the pLaintiff, acknowledging the receipt of an I U U for 224*, undertook not to take any proceedings to recover the amount, provided the defendant would pay the amnount by instalments of 21. per month, whichl It appeared he had not done. Lord CAeBELI said that upon this evidence the plaintiff was clearly entitled to a verdict for the amount claimed, and directed the jury to find their verdlct accord. ingly. jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, for 221 Tf'l)A V. ELSTOF. Mr. Huddleston, Q.C., and Mr. Denny, appeared for the plaintiff; and lr. Petersdorff and Mr. Laston for the do. fendant. The plaintiff in this action, Robert Tidman, was a houso pa inter and deoorator, living at No. 117, Jermyn-street; and be defendant, Elizabeth Ann ElAstof, was the daughter of a Mr. Dryden Eletof, who lived with a second wife whom he had married. at No. 48, Dover-street, Piccadilly. The defendant lived with her father and stepmother, and she was sued by the plaintiff in this action to recover the sum of 421. 14s. Id., being the amonnt of the plaintiff's bill for decorating the ground floor and drawing-room of No. 48. It appeared from the plaintiff's evidence that in the early aut oftShpreseuityearthe defendant cAme to his shop with a .n=eil, and gave directions to him to do some decorations to a suite of rooms on the groundfloor of the house which had been taken by Mr. Walter BlundelL She said that Mr. Blundell was an excellent tenant, that he was to pay 200 guineas a-year rent, but she could only afford 24 towards the paper Mr. Blundell wanted; but that he (the plaintiff) was to do the work If Mr. Bl'ndell required it. The work was done, and some things sunplied on the defendant's order, which raised the bill to 3L'. 12s. 7d. Some decorations were also done to the drawing-room, as the plaintiff said, by the defendant's orders, and the bill for this part of the work amounted to 12 Is 6lsd., makine a total of 424 14s. ld. The plaintiff vws told that BlundelU 'would pay for what had been done to his rooms, and he drew upon him a bill for the amount, which Blundell sa. cepted. It appeared that in a few weeks Blundell, who had had the rooms done up in the first style, with a viewr to start. ing in the world s a dentist, left the place, became involved in some Chancery prooeedings, and got into the Queen's Prison. The plaintiffl therefore, could get no money fromn him; and when he applied to the defendant she told him her father was liable for what had been done to the drawving-roiom. The plaintiff soon after heard that the father, 5lr. Dryden Blstof, had become insolvent, and hhd petitioned the tUouut at Ipiwich. He accordingly went dow to Ipswich to oppose him. but he failed in his opposition to the defendant's father because he swore that, not he, but the daughter was liable. The present action was then brought, The plaintiff distinctly swore that he had reoeived orders from tbe defendant to do the work, but he admnitted that he had debited Blundell and lir. Dryden Elstof with tie amount due. Oa the part of tbe defendant Mrs Elstof was called. She stated that she kept the house at No. 48, Dover-stteet, and tbat she let lodgings. Her husband lived with her, butook no part in the conduct of the house, the -payment of rate, nnd taxes and all otber domestic expentes devolving apon herself. The furniture in the house formerly belong,ed to
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. WzmwmR DlEa. 1. -1nTBL.V J* B ^ f 87 (SiMings at Nis Prim, bcforo taw LoitD CTx JTusTicE and Comrnmm Jurt-.) Mr. Lush and Mr. E. Powell were counsel for the plaintiff; Y-r. Serjeant Pary and Mr. Metcalfe appeared for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action is a haybinder, and made a contract with the defendant, who is a farmer at Kensalgreen and dairyman and cowkeeper near the Edgeware-road, to mow certain fields for the defendant at 25s. per acre, and this action was for work alleged to have been done under that contract. The only dispute in the case, however, was as to a sucu of 291. which the defendant insisted he bad paid the plaintiff, but which the plaintiff denied that he had xeceived. It appeared that the plaintiffis an illiterate man (but not to such an extent as to be unable to read writin), and when the contract above mentioned was made the defendant made two copies, one of which he kept himself and the other he lave to the plaintiff. The defendant generally pid the plaitiff in the hayfield, and when he did so used so enter the amount upon his own copy and also upon the plaintiff's, and always made the entry upon the plaintiff's copy at the time. Upon coming to a settlement one day with the latiff, the plaintif called over to the defendant the fltms entered upon his copy, and according to the plaintiffs account at that time there was onl- one sum of 291. entered on the plaintiffs copy, but two sums entered upon the defendant's. The plaintiff said he had not received one of these sums, and told the defendant that he could see from his own handwriting upon the plaintSis copy that he never had received it. Upon this the defen- dant became angry, snatched up the paper, and put it in hisl pocket. Notice to Produce thls paper at the trial had been given, and, upon being produoed to-day, It appeared that there were two sums of 291. entered upon It, and the laitiff now charged the defendant with having entered one of these subnequently to his snatching away the paper. The plaintiff was the only witness m support of his ce. Among other evidenoe he stated that a person named Wire, a farner at Hendon, had made a copy for7him ofathe sums entered upon the back of his copy of the agreement, and alleged a3 an argument In his favour that the sum in dispute wa not entered upon this paper. Wire, however, who, as the plaintiff said, wrrote the paper in the hayfield inink, anzd took the ink fromu his pocket, was not called on The defendant and his foreman were called for the defence. The former Insisted that the paper was in the same state as when he put it in his pocket, and said that he did that because he was annoyed and excited, and thought plaintiff meant to cheat him. Both plaintiff and defendant appeared to be excitable men, and the defendant, on his own showing, a careless mau of business. The cross-examinations extended to a considerable length, and the jury, after retiring for nearly three-quarters of an hour, found their verdict for the plaintiff-Damages 271. 15s. GIRANVILLE V. PUGIL. Mr. Edwin Jamaes, Q.C., and Mr. Gibbons were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Dowdeswell apeared for the defendant. 'lhi was an action to recover 451. for five weeks' rent, from the 18th Jtne, 1857, of a ready furnished house, situated 1 Curzon-street, May-fair. The defenee was, that the house and furniture were infested with bugs. blr. JApIsS, in opening the plaintiff's case, said that the plaintiff is a physician of considerable English and European eelebrity. The defendAnt is the member for Moutgomeryshire. -The plaintiff, who frequently had occasion to visit the German watering. places, let his house to the defendant in June last during his absence. The defendant, after occupying the house for two nights, had thought proper to leave it, upon the ground alleged in the plea; and the plantiff was a good deal hurt at the imputation cast upon hs 8residence. the jury probably knew what a bug was. Linneus described the csmex, or bug, as an hemipterous insect, of which there are several families. There are the Pacntatomidar, Co- oi.ea, and others. There is even the Uimex Templanius. (Laughter.) The LoRD CHies JusTies said this was an aspersion upon the Temple-as a bencher for many years, he had never seen one there. (Laughter.) Mr. JASBIS said he would show that in this case a vermin doctor had been called in-a professional bugkiller-who would exhibit a tabular statoment of the number of insects and of their eggs which he had found upon extamination, and would prove that, although bugs were found in most houses in London, there was no house more exempt than the plaintiff's. Several witneeses were then called for the plaintiff, in. cluding Mr. Lahee, of Bond-street, who let the house to the defendant, and the plaintiff's wife and daughter. It appeared from their evidence that the house had been rebuilt within the last six years, and that all the furniture was new, and that the plaintiff's family had not been aunoyed to any extent by the nuisance complained of. The bed furniture was washed once or twice every year, and had been washed 'oAthiu less than three maonths of the letting of the house to the defendant. Charlotte Forbes, the plaintiffs cook, admitted that on one occasion she saw a beg on the defendant's coachman's coat, whioh was put In the fire. Mr. Lahee's clerk said that the houso and furditure were good, nice and clean. He went into the attics, and the Welsh cook was there with him alone. alr. JAEwS.-What happened ? As to the buge, I mean. Are you an entyrnologist? Can you tel a London bug fron a Welsh one? (Laughter.) The witness stated that he oould not. The cook brought 12 or 14 in a basin, and showed them to him. Cross-examined. -The furniturein the attics was clean. An uplholsterer stated that he had cleaned the bedsteads, and foumw several with eggs in the front top floor. He counted 10 in all in the whole house. The insects will go into the best houses. He did not know how long they took to hatch. He had known bedsteads cleaned and supposed to be thoroughly clean, and nevertheless the insects were dis- . covered again within a week, The defendant's case, which was supported by his own evidence, and that of several of his servants, was that he came up from Llanerchydoll, his residence in Wales in Jume lat to attendto hisParlLamentary duties, and took tie hoase in question for that purpose; that the defendant slept in the plaintiff's own room, and was not troubled; but that the very first night the defendant's con, who slept on the floor over him, came down to him for a 4iht, and said he could not sleep on account of the bugs; his son would not sleep in the house again, and his servants who slept In the attics w-ere much disfigured when they oame down in the morning. The defendant at Mr. Lahee's request remained a second night, and his cook, Elien Jones, who had been six years in his service, after the second night told him that rather than remain in the house, she woald quit his service. Ellena Jones said she had knocked down 10 into a washhand-basin. There was, however, very little evidence of the insects pervading any of the chambersofthe house except the attics. In these it seemed that 20 or 30 hua been discovered; but on the lower floor there was no direct evidence of more than two or three. The Lord CrF JUSTICE, in sunmMing up, said the question was for the jury. The defendant was liable unless they considered that upon the evidence the house was unfit for habitation, and the defendant's reason for leaving sufficient. No doubt the servants suffered on the first and secondnights; but it seemed to his Lordship that the in. convenience was confined to the attic story. A man's servants were part of his familly, and were entitled to his consideration, aud the question was, whether the jury were satisfied that the rooms appropriated to the servants were in such a state as to admit of their getting their natural rest In them and to be habitable for a man's family, or whether the Louse was uninhabitable. A house was not uninhabitable when by a little exertion and exuenso the nuisnce migit be got under by a charwoman or a aMndres. If, howevor, it would require great expense to et rid of the nuisance, to have a scientific ougkiller calledin, and the wainscot taken down, it would be otherwise. The Question was whether the 23 or 24 Insects which had been found in the upper story were such a nuisance as to justifyrthe defendant in thinking they could not be got under and throwing up the house. Was there evidence of a safficieut amounut of the -uresence of these insects to render the house unfit for habitation?9 Th mury immediately returned a verdict for the plaintiff for 41 The LORD CmXrF JUSTICE, in the course of the trial, observing a jnryman was suffering from a bad cough, suggested that he should be allowcd to leave the box, and the cause was, by consent, tried by 11 jurymen only.
COURT O'F FYnTnM TmiQAv Th,nl I BECINGHAm V. REEVE. (Sitings at Nisi Prius. before the CHIEF oAx..)i Mi. Serjeant Ballantine and Mr. Petersdorff were oouwsel foOr tthe Pl ntidff; Mr. acaula and Mr. Raymond appetred Both the prties to th.is action are dealers in horses, pd he question rsed by the pleadingls wa whether acert horse, bought by tbe plaintiff from the defendant for 461., at Reading Fair, last sulmmer, with a warranty that he was gquiet in harness," deserved that cbaracter or not, - On the part of the plaintiff, it was sbown that the horse was sold by him to Mlr. Cottrell.a London jobmua6ter, for 481., on the same diy on which he was sold to theplaintlff. and that when hewas,put into a break he kicktd and plunged so violently as to break the pole and damage the carriage, conduct which was repeated, though with less violenw, on a bubsequezat occamsion. The hgrse wvas accordingly returned to the plaintiff, and as the defendant declied to take him back he was sold at Aldridge's at a lIss of 121., for which sum this action was brought. On the part of the defendant numerous witnesses deposed to the history of the anmal in question, tracing him for the last two years from fair to fair 1i Yorkshlre, WArwickahre, Wiltshire, and Berkshire till he came into the defendantfs possesdoI HiEs history was then resumed from. the sale at Aldridge's, where the defndant hought hiu, down, to tho present. day and hour, for he then stood in P?alace-yard in a break ready to be inspected by the jury. All the witnesses, whether dealers, grooms, or gentlemen, agreei in saying that the horse throughout those periods was entirely free from vice of any sort, doing all sorts of work in all sorts of vehioles without flincbing, and with the utraost good-nature. At the close of the case for the defendant, The jury intimated that they were satisfied, and Were prepared to find for the defendant. MrSerjeant BALLANTITE, however, claiuned hls right to reply on the whole case, and in so doing contended that the conduct of the horse since his sale at AIdridge's had nothing to do with the case of the plaintiff, which was, that he was a ldcker when sold tdohim with a warranty that he was quiet. It was clear that he had kiclked whlle in MIr. Cottrell's possession, and was, therefore, anything but quiet il harness at the time of the sale to the plaintiff. The CHsiF Buaox.-The real question, Bruihor Ballatine, is wrhether the two trials by Cottrell are to outweigh the excellent general character given to this auimal by the defendant's witnese. It may very wel be that a horse put into new harness anan unaccustomed carriage once or twice might kick, and yet be deserving of a warranty such as the defendant had given to this horse. Mr. Serxj.ant BALL,NrNEL-After that expression of yotur Lordship's opinion, agreeiDg as it does with the intimation from the jury, I feel tbat in the exercise of my discretion as counsel for the paintiff I ought to withdraw from the case. I sball therefore elect to bo nonsuited. Thie CHs BARox having expressed his approval of the course purmed by the learned counsel, and of the view taken of the evidence by the jury, directed the plaintiff to be "called." The plaintiff was therefore nonsuited. ROWLAND V. ?RINCE. 3fr. Serjeant Parry and Mr. Petersdorff were counsel for the plantiff; Mr. Huddleston and Mr. Murray appeared for the defendants.

COURT OF BANEB-PU2Cy, Basi l-s!rCUt De. L In R1E SYEMS, WALEBB, AND SYEP. (Befoi Mr. ommiw~ioc GouI.BUIR.) TneO DArUptse were mewhants of London and LiverpooL This was a resumed certificate meeting. Mr. IAnklater appeared for the assignees; Mr. Bagley And Mr. Roxburgh for the bankrupts; Mr. Lawranoe for the opnosing creditors Tha bankrupt, Daniel Backhouse Syers, examlned deposed that he joined Morris, Byers, and Walker on Vhe 1st of Janu , 1854. 6He had previously been in businews at Liverpool. At the time he entered into partnerhio he took MKessrs. yers and Walker's word as to their positon. According to the banker's passbook it appeared. tiab aboutl1,000,0001 of money ad passed throughthe hand# of the new firm. Mr. Walker Attended to the Liverpool branch of the business, and all contracts entered into by the firm in London were communicated to Mr. Walker. About the 14th of November, 1855, he made a calculation as to the position of the firm. It then appeared that after allowlng 16,0001. for bad debts and losses there would have been a gross profit of 60,0001. Between the time of the caloula#on and thedate of the stoppage the price of linseed, rice, rape. seed, and other minor articles in which they dealt, fell considerably. The result was that a loss of 100,3421. accrued upon theze articles between November 1856 and Api 18 The great fell in price was caused by the cessation of the Russdan war. By reason of the fall in the rate of freights a large loss likewise accrued. The firm were in the habit of chartering vessels to bring produce from abroad, with a view to saving the high rate of frelght chargeable abroad. Mr. Warner, the opposing creditor, always applied to them to buy. The 450 tons of iron recently purchased of Mr. Warner were sent to India and Melbourne. It was purchased at 91 7s. 6d. per ton as good Staffordshire Iron. There was a loss upon the iron, and there was great difficulty in selling it in consequence of its bad quality. Great complAints were made about it. On the 4th of April, the date of the stoppage, he sent to Ifr. Coleman. At that time he had in his posession money of the firm to the amount of between 2,'00 and 2,4001. Mr. Coleman advised them to retain a sum for expenses, and to pay the residue Into the Bank of England. A large portion of this sum had been expended in consequence of the pending bankrutcyand in necessary outgoings for his family. He saw Mr. Warner at his brother's house on the ovening of the sp. pge. llr. Warner alluded to his heavy loss, and asked im to give him a bill of lading to relieve him from the heavy d^bt. MAs brother saAid that he could not do sO be. cause that would be giving him a preference. Mr. Warner pressed very hardly, hut did not get anything. Mr. Warner was the only creditor who opposed the composition. After the meeting of creditors he saw Mr. Warner, who said that if he would give him a check for 6001. he would be satisfied. Ho (bankrupt) said he would do nothing of the kind. He (bankrupt) had not kept a carriage and horses. Cross-examined.-The sum of 7501., withheld by hils brother and himself, was for the purpose of meeting any expenditure during the pending prooeedings. The bankrupt Walker, examined, deposed that he joined Mr. Syers in March, 1851. He then made a calculation as to the position of Mr. Syers's affairs, and the rtsult was that he found Mr. Syers's capital was 1,9001. The capital he (Walker) brought in was 1,8001. The business gradually increased after his joining it. In 1851 25,00' passed through the bankers; in 1852 101,0004;, In 1853 205, 000. In 1852 there was a considerable profit, and in 1853 a profitgof about 8,0004 He attended to the Liverpool branch of the business. He was from time to time informed of' all the transactions of the firm. He gave advice, but itwas not always followed. He beheved Mr. Daniel Syers's estimate of the position of the firm in November, 1855, was correct. It was a frequent practice for merchants to charter ships for bringing goods fzom abZo"X3A; otherwise they wrould have to depend upon shipowvnera. The business carried on by the firm was of the ordinary nature. The dravwings of the partnerswr regulated according to the profits He advised a sale of goohds in November, 1855, hat his partners thought proper Cross-examined.-The ships the firm took up were picipally for bringing over their own goods, but sometintz when there was spare room, it was let out at a profit. The firm never chartered ships for other people. The bankrupt, Morris Syers, examined, deposed that the sum of ,501. was retained for the purpose of meeting the necessary expenditure. On the evening of the stoppage Mr. Warner called at his house.and said he had made a very large loss by the firm, and that it wouid be a very gat inconvenience to him, and he wanted to know whether his brother would not give him some bills of lading or anyting He (bankrupt) said that he should not do so, becausm tha wouldbe a preference and he was determinAed not to give a preference to anyboay. Large losses had accrued to the firm in respect to the fall in pr_ec of freight. Mr. Alexander Rose, of the firm of Wilson, Rose, Graham, and Co., Russdi brokers, deposed that he had been in business 25 years. Ee had known Mr. Morris Robert fyers for some years, and had acted as the broker of the firm. There had been a great fall in the price of goods in which the bankrupts traded. Cross-examined.-He did not consider that the bankrupts were justified in entering into such large speculations, seeing their capital was so small Re-examaned.-Undoubtedly some people purchased at the end of 1855, anticipating a further riso of prlces, but it w1as rather desperate wrork. (Lughter.) Mr. Parry, a colonial broker, deposed to the regularity of the bankArupts' course of trade. HtTis HONOUR deferred judgmPent. (BcfOrc MS. Commi&qoner HOLROYD.) IN RE W5LLIA.M BUDDLE. The bankrupt was a builder, of 5, Delarue.terrace, Paddington.

M-rDDlS± SE9ES&rON$, !Tucay, DM 1. . (Be )-Q-r. rs,QC.) George Coboper and 'Henry Lusland-.were Indicted for stealing a quantty of bed linen, the property of William *Norman;. in his dwelling.hoase. Cooper pleaded " Guilty." Mir. Payne appeared for the prosecution, MIr. Ribbon for Riitlando The property mentioned in the indictment was mean safe about 8 o'clock on the evening of the 18th of November, and about 9 the same night Charles Cole, a policeman, inplain clothes, saw the prisoers come out of Tottenhanmstreet, the prosecutor'shouse being in Gower-pl, and goup to a cab on the rank. Cooper was carryingalarge buidle. Rut- lnd opened the cab door, and Cooper partly put the bundle' in, but, observiag that they were watched, they went to another cab, when, finding that the plain clothes mn stil had his eye upon them, they held a short conferenoe behind the vehile, after which they threw the bundle down, and went away at tho top of their speed, Cole, of course, giving chase -on suspicion. He caught Cooper just by the Qunen'a Theatre, and Rutland was captured by a policemmn and a postman, whose atten. tSon had been called by the cry of " Stop thief I" Coop told the officer it was like his Impudence to stop him, and if he had not taken that liberty he should have eaught the thief. The bundle contained the property stolen from the prosecutor's house, which had been opened by a false latchkey. The defence set up by Uutland before the magistrate was that he had only met Cooper by chance, and knew nothing of the bundle. Mir. RroBwN addressed the jury for Rutland, and at the suggestion of that prisoner, and with the sanction of the Court, called Cooper as a witnes on his behalf. He swore that he did the robbery all by himself, and met Rtutland by acciednt about 20 yards from where they were firat eeca by the polceman. In crows-examination he said he did not know how many different names he had gone by; nor how many times he sad been in prison. The jury, without hesitation, found Rutland guilty, and. it was proved that he was a regular companion of known thlevea. There was a previouns oonvicetion against Cooper. fr. Buiss sentenced the latter to four yes' penal servi-' tude; Rutland to hard labour for one year. Michael Brian and Micbael B att, labourers, were Indicted for unlawfully Inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Charles Kimber, a police-onstable, while in the dischirge of his duty. Mr. Cooper prosecuted; 31r. Orridge and Mr. Horry were for the prisoners. The prisoners were fighting in Hyde Park on the 20th of September, when the prosecutor, who was the polioeman on duty, parted them, and wished them to go home. Iu n few minutes they rsumed the fight, and he again intefeed, and said if they did not desist le should lock them up. Brratt said it would require the whole force and more to take him, and immediatelthrew the cDnstable downand juped n him,breaking leg and dislocating ens him, brealdng his leg suddiE nghisanole. Anot er constable and a person named Goodheat, who went to his assistance, were also amaulted by both prisoners. The defenoe wa tht the Injury sustained by the policeman was the result of ccident, and that if guilty at all the prisoners were gaUty only upon the minor charge. The jury found them Euily, and Mr. BaLqs sentenced Barratt to 12 and Brian to two monUth hard labour. Anbroslne Ie Blanc, 27, a Froech governess, a person with a countenance remarkably expressive of cunning, was indicted for stealing a gold watch, a silver watch, a quantity of Clothing, moneo la notes and gold, a variety of trinketa, &c., altogether o the value of about 601., the property of Elizabeth Horsford, Richard Waters, and Peter aston, in the dwellinghowse of the fLrst-nameda Mr. Cooper appeared for the proeution; the prs,oner wasnot defended. The circumstanes of this cass, particularly those relating to the apprehension of the prisoner, were of an extraordinary Caracter, and the robbery which the prisoner coi.: rmitted was one of the most impudent, heartless, and ungrateful ever heard of. The prosecuiri2, E bth Hors ford, was a widow, iving atthe lodge of a villa in Regent's Park belonging to a gentleman namedBishop, and In the early part of September the prisoner called to make some inquiry of her, and, finding her a person of easy and charitable disposition, the prisoner, it would seem, singled her out as the victim of a subtle scheme of plunder. She excited her Bympath by recounting her struggles and trials as a governees, an the sufferings sho had undergone since she left her native place, and made use of the name of a Catholic clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Martin, and she told her tale so well, that it had the desired effect, and Mrs. Horeford told her that as she was friendless and homeless, as she had represented, she might stay with her until she procured a situation, which would not be inconvenient, as the family was then outof town. For about eight weeks the prisoner ate, drank, and ale pt at the lodge, free of cost, Mrs. Hors. ford being actuated b purely benevolent motives. One day in October frfs. Horsferd left the lodge about n in the morning, to go to market, thinklug, of course, that the lodge would be as safe in the prisoner's charge as her own, but when she returned she found that every box and drawer in the place had been ransacked, and every available artiole stolen. Theprisoner was gone. Mr. Bishop's groom hadleft his trunk in charge of Mlrs. Horsfordat the lodge ; that was broken open, and his best clothes and hisvngs, 161. s 6d. taken away, and the other things taken not Mrs. Horsford's belonged to a nephew of her. Just before this the prisoner had represented that she had obtained a situation in a gen. tlemans family at Epping as governess to the young lady. but that was a falsehood to throw Mrs. Ho Cord off her track. The case was placed in the hands of Parsons- 182, D division, who ascertained that a man with whom the prisoner had cohabited was a prisoner in Aylesbury Gaol, and to Aylesbury he went for the purpose of seeing if any letters came to himu, thinlkng, of course that after e p such a booty the prisoner would write t him Seli wis correct in this surmise, for the post brought a letter in female handwriting, addressed to the man. 7he officer ooncluded that the man, upon his release, would make for where the woman was, so he disguised himself as a jour. neyznan saddler out of work, and contrived, when tho ma was let out of gaol, to get into his company, and they tramped along the road together to Wycombe, where they slept that night. Next morning the man said he was going onto Windsor. The disgaised officer said thaS was just the very place he waS going to. When they got to Windsor the man said he was going to remain there some days, and on paring with hhi the policeman went off to the railway station, where shortly afterwards his friend made his appearance, and inquired about a train for Richmond. He took a ticket for that place, so did the policeman, but un. known to him; and on getting out of the train at Eichmond the policeman, who was intending to watch him, heard him inquire for Rosedale-house. Knowing where Rosedalehovse was situated, he hurried thither, and found that A person ansvering the description of the prisoner was engaged there as governes-Rsedale.house being a J scholastic establishment-and on seeing her he was satisfied she was the person he was in quest of, and to her amazement told her she was his prisoner. She was then wearing Ms. florsford's gold watch, and a great portion of the stolen property was found in her poesession. Some she said was hers; some she acknowledged was Mr Hors. ford's. While he was searcling her boxes a letter, written in French, arrived from the man who had been discharged fror gaol, in which he informed the prisoner that he was in the immediate vicinity, and had preferred writing to ac. quaint her of that circumstance to making a personal appearsuce at Rosedale-house, as he might be suspected. e letter was written In a very affectionate strai, and contained many expreseions of love and attachment, and kisses innumerable. The officer at once brought the pri. soner and the property to London, and the whole of the articles found in her posseesion, except some new sill dresses, which there was every reason to believe were pur. chased with tho groom's money, were identified by Mr. Horaford the notes had not been traced, but about 127. ir; gold was fo=nd upon her, which the groom would receive. The prisoner addressed the jury at considerable length in broken English, and shed tears, and appeared almost over. come with emotion, as she asserted her innocence and de. fended her reputation from the stain cast upon it. She said she first became acquainted with Mrs. Hornford in August when she inquired of her if she knew vwhere she could get apartments near the park. Mrs. Horsford said she had a friend whom she thought could accommodate her, but, find. ing thatb she could not, she offered to let her lodge with her, which she agreed to, and paid her 1U. per week all the while she was there. Mrs. Horsford had a domestic misfortune which rendered pecuniary assistanCe necessary, and she appled to her for a loan of 2651., which she advanced, aud received as security the depodt of these artioles. She obtained a situation, which she had to go to at once, and, as Mrs. Horsford could not let herhave her money, sbe took the things away with her. She denied that she went away clandestinely, 1r. Horsford having known for a week that she was going, and said it was a cruel thing to attempt to crush a poor governess. She had nao friend, no parent, In the world. She had applied to the FrenchConsul for assistance, which had been refused her; but this was a noble country; its jurors were upright and intelligent men; and to those who were trying her she would appeal, not for mercy because she was a foreigner and unprotected, but for justice to a fellow-creature whose character had hitherto been irreproachable. AIr. COOPER proposed to recall Mr Horsford, to ask her as to the truth of the prisoner's statement about the things having been given to her as security for a loan Mr. BLSS said there was no necessity to do Bo. The pri- s ha fulltues commtand of language,oand had not asked one wor I crssexaintio aoutan lan,andshe hadnot A juryman said it would perhaps be bettor if Mrs. Hors. ford answered the question. Mr. BMss.-Prisoner, do you wish MIrs. Horeford to be asked if you lent her money, and she gave you these things as security ? Prisoner.-Oh dear, no;not at atlL l eave my case with you. The jury found her Guilty. Mr. CoopER sid the prisoner, hewas informed, two years ago, had apartments which she left without paying rent, and after a robbery, and she had already begun to rob the lady she went to live with at Richmond, when she was taken on this charge. He thought it his duty to add that there bad been great laxity on the part of the Rev. M r. Martin in recommending her to Dlaces when he knew so little about her real character. She was a pretty governess indeed. M r. BLISS said he never heard of a worse case, and If there had been any previous conviction proved against the prisoner he should have sentenced her to penal servitude for a Ion time. As it w.a , be should sentence her to one year's

POLICE, Bow-sT ..-.Joseph Clarkson was brozght up in ak-' tody of Lnspector Cheol-ey, of the B divison, on acha .ro of obtaining two pleces of damask from Messrs. Shoolbred and Co., drapers, of Tottenham oourt-road, by muens of a forged order, lrporting to be written by.Major Martin, of Etozvoourt, woroestersh3re UR appeared that on Tuesday, November 24, Mears. Shoolbred received through the post a letter, written Ina neat hand, and with remarkable precision in punctuation, which ran s follows:- "Maor Martin bonght from enLShoolbted, a shart2 tie ago, As Major Artian had, in fact, been recently sup lied i a h two pleces of dAsnaeklca ue, as n ere descrlbed, s or use at Upton-court,no doubt ws entertained of tbe genuineness of the order, which was accordingly complled with, the goods being forwarded as directed. Subsequently, however, it was asoertained that, though Major Martin with his servant did go down to Up ton-court by the train specified, they never received the goods, nor were they aware of their existence. The order was, in fact, a forgery, and the damask was received at the cloak-room by some person passing himself off for the Major's servant. Under these circumstances, Messrs. Shoolbred consulted their, solictor, Mr. Chamberlayne, by whose advlcoe the case was placed in the hands of Inspector Cbeckley, of the Edivision, who discovered on inquiry that the goods had been pledged for 51. 10s, by the prisoner at the bar. The latter was apprehended on Monday night, and at onco identiffed by the pawnbroker. These facts having been stated by Mr. Chamberlayne, -Xffiient formal evidence was given to judify a remand, and the further examination of the prisoner was adjonrned for a few days, when the polioe expect to be in a position to disclose some further facts. Thomas Smith, who recently filled the office of secretary to one of the "courts" or lodges of a society called the "Ancient Order of Foresters,"vwas charged with for1ing a "ccertificate," or order for the payment of asumnof &,h amount of a claim on the Funeral Fund. The court In question Is entitled the " Star of Westminster," and Is held at the Green Hin, in St. Mrtin'slane. The order ought to have been signed by the chairman, or "chief ranger" of the court, by the " viceranger," and then by the secretary. The prisoner, however, had himself written all the signatures, and on receivIng the money had not paid It over to the clauiants entitled to it. Having been expelled from the society (or some previous defalcations, the prisoner was on the dis. covery of this transaction given In custody. The prisoner alleged that it had been the custom these 18 years past for him to write the three signatures without troubling the chief ranger or his deputy. This was denied by AL. DMira F. lazard, the chief ranger, who, however, adnitted that he had never seen one of these orders before. Prisoner.-Because they were never dgned by him. Mr. James Gregson, the district secretary, by whom the money had been paid on this order said that it would not have been paid had he suspected tZat the signatures were written by the secretary. Orders so signed had been presented within his knowledge, but payment was refused until the signatures were written by the rangers themnselves. Mr. JAnRDINx-Why did you not then charge the secreWimtnes.-We thought it was done through ignorance or nilsapprehension of the law. Mr. JAnin;D said that, under these circumstances, it was Impossible to sustain a charge of forgery. Such a loose mode of transacting the society's business was highly objectionable, as it removed all check on the secretary. Neither woud a charge of obtaining money under false pretences hold, as the representation was a true one. He feared it was only a debt fronu the prisoner to the person whom he ought to bare paid. Mr. Branscourt, soliditor for the society, thought the mlsapproprlation was an offence under the rules. Mr. JAIu)fw -Pelhe ps so. I will remand him on his own recognizances, that you may look over the rules and see if you can make anything of that. WESTMsUFST-Peter Bailey, apensionerfrom the army, was charged with fraud and forgery. The accused was engaged as an assistant to Iieutenant Wllias, of the Land Transport Corps, who is recruitingfor the5thFunileers.

A MODEST SoTC BAKnuT.-The EcdinburgJt Gazde of Friday, under the headof "Sootch Bankru icy," contains this unobtrusive notification:-" John Edrd Stephens, residing In Northumberland-street, Edinburgh, formerly banker, and lately of Gothic-lodge, Twickenham, county of Middlesex, tobe examined in Sheriffs.office, Edinburgh, 7th December, at 12." John Edward Stephens is a rather oommon name, and a common name is some. times of essential advantage to a man. If, In this case, it had unfortunately been Iumphrey Stephens there might have been some ground for public reoognition. "Formerly banker," too, is a common description enough; for who In the course of his life has not had the misfortune to become the holder of a share in aome fraudulent joint-stock bank t Again, "lately of Gothi,-lodge, Twickenham," is nob partlcularly definite at a time when you cannot take a stroll round anyone of the metropolitan suburbs without mEeting 'with a NottinRhamuhouse, a Tonbrldge-vlla, a Mhilock-cottage, or a Richmond-lodge, at which some modest Jones, Stephens, orBrown has not "latelyresided." Iest the publc, after guessing again and again iu vain who this John Edwards Stephens, of Northumberland-street, Edinburgh, can be, should at length oonclude that he is a myth, or that this is one of those caes so aptly described by the poet, of " modest merit born to blush unseen," it may be stated that the MIr, Stephens here referred to is no other person than that oelebrated financier, the Mr. John Edwrd Stephens, lately Army or Navy surgeon, and manager of the London and Eastern Banking Corporation. The practioe among debtors in the oounty of -Middlesex to emigrate to Scotland having of late become fashionable, it may be well to take cognizance of the fact. Such of them as do not like to face Basinghall-street find it much pleasanter to take up a residenoe for 40 dxys in Scotland. Bankrujpcy cases are In Edinburgh much more gingerly handled, there is greater privacy, and creditors may be deterred from incurring the great inconvenience and erpense of a journey of several hundred miles from Middlesex la order to lay their complaints before a Scotch sheriff. The time 'would appear to have arrived when the bankruptcy laws of England and Sootland should be either assimfldeA or the jurisdiction of the latter be subjected to very necessary and most wholesome abridgment. The amount 6wing by this man and his intimate assocates to the ufortunate shareholders of the London and Eastern Bank is very large. Colonel Waugh, its principal director, cannot be had. The state of his health rendered his departure for Franoe and Spain necessary at a time 'when his dupes wanted him here. e have now tne manager, Stephens, gettingqnletly relieved from his liabilities in the She B-ofrioe, Edinburgh. It is ta be hoped that when he makes his appearance in thatK offioo on the 7th of December some of his London creditora may be " there to see." TRLiC OF A NEw STFA?, APPARATus.-S ouim AOPNo Tuesday.-The Royal Mall Company's steamshiP Avon, which has undergone a complete renovation and refit prior to leaving for the Brazils on the 9th Inst., went out for a trial trip to-day, princlply for testing the effiacz of Wethered's " Patent Combined Steam Apparatus` *hich has already been so suocessfully tried on board Her Afa esty' stesmships Black Eagle and Dee. On the recommendation of lMr. George Mills, previous to the retirement from the office of SuperIatending Engineer to the company, this apparatus has been applied to the Avon, and the trial of today has been looked forward to with grest interest by scientific persons. At dtarting the engines worked up to their greatest speed producing 16 revolutions per milunte, and alter three hours' working with plain 8team they commenced with the combined steam, and the result was most satlsfactory to aU on board It clearly roved that the power exered ws equal to Anl ncrease of lU-horse 'rower, and the oonsumption of fuel about 20 per oent les. There can be no doubt from the result of this trial thid the general application of this prindple wil be a great boon to ocsnmteam, navigation, from the combined advantgs of a diminished consumption of fuel with an incrs of horse, power. Among other scientific gentlemen on board the Avon were CAptn Whisk and Young (two of the Royal Mall Coinpanys directors), Captain W. Vincent, C%ptain Strutti >.

She returned to Jersey last night. The Diadem, screw, 31, Captain Moorsom, C.B., went out of Portsmouth harbour again yesterday, and after running the measured mile at Stokes Bay anchored at Spit. head. On this trial she improved in her speed under the influence of the new screw and at a new pitch, having averaged a speed of rather better than 12 knots against wind and tide, royal and topgallant yards across; force of the wind 5.

COTTAGES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Some admirable remarks of Mr. B. Hope made at Maidstone on cottages appeared in The Timem on the 24th of November. The third room for the boys of a family, after the parents and girls of a family are provided for, is the great object. Few cottage builders (certainly not the directors of the North-Western and Great Western Railways, -who have built so largely at Wolverton and Swindon) seem to be awre that this third room may be provided for the sum of 61.; indeed, without any additlonal expenditure, if the dwellings were constructed with a greater attention to comfort than to external appearance. This 61. is the sum nay builder asks for constructing a boy's room in such cottages as he built for me 12 years ago, in addition to the price then paid-viz., 751. The secret consists merely in returning to the old high-pitch roofs of our ancestors, and making a room for boys with step ladder and dormer window, or one In the gable. Supposo the roof to be an equUateral triangle, and the width of the cottage to be 24 feet by 14 feet-that is, the lower rooms to be 12 by 14, and 10 by 14, then by erecting queen posts, six feet from the eaves, 12 feet will be left in the centre, by 14, and eight feet high for the boys' room. The queen posts, being 8 feet high, erected 6 feet from the eaves, wil meet the roof joists 10 feet from the eaves, and therefore 14 from the ridge. The low-roofed slated cottages not only are devoid of the seful space of the cockloft, but are inconveniently hot in summer and cold in winter. It may be noted that sash windows give greater facilities for ventilation, without costing more with the present Drice I ODIS ODec11Qntiy, -. r,- C. IL B.
DESTRUCTION OF AN EXTENSIVE WORSTED Mmr. -A large factory, the property of Messrs. W. and H. Foster, worsted spinners and stuff manufacturers, at the moorland viUage of Derholme, between Bradford and alifax, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, was destroyed by fire on Saturday last. The building, which was situated at the base of a hill close to the high road, between Halifax and Keighley, was 150 feet long, 42 feet broad, and fonr stories high, exclusive of the attic. The fire broke out a few minutes before 6 o'clock on Saturday morning, just as the workpeople, nearly 900 in number, were about to commence work. The miU was lighted throughoat with gas, and the fire was frst discovered in tho attio. Some of the work. mnen on proceeding to that room found one of the twisting. frames in a blaze, and one of them ran for a bucket of water to put out the fire, but the flames quickly extended from frame to frame, until the whole were one mass of fire. Great efforts were made by the workmen-for there was plenty of water inithe reservoirs on the premises-to check the progress of the conflagration, and steam valves, which were supplied to every room for the purpose of extinguishing fire, were opened; but al was In valn. The fire was communicated from room to room, and by half-past 7-long before which the roof had faUen in-the whole building was envelopedin one huge aheet of fire, which lighted up the surrounding hills for many miles. and presented a spectacle of terrible grandeur. .lFive engines from Halifax and Queenshead reached the spot about half-past 7, but they were of comparatively little use. The fire went on in its uncontrollable fury, and by 9 o'clock the building was reduced to a mere shell, with stores, machinery, charred woodwork, and other contents of the factory lying in a smouldering heap at the bottom. The engine-house connected with the milU was saved, as were also a large building nearly adjoining the one destroyed, toalled " tho new mill," and some warehouses well stocked with wool, tops, pieces, &o. The origin of the fire has not beea ascertained, but it is supposed to have been in some way connected with the gas with which the mill was lighted, The loss is ostimated at 20,0001., a large portion of which, however, is covered by insurances,-namely, in the Scottish Union, 5,5001.; *Royal, 4,6001. I Uity, 3,7501,; West of England, 2,0001.; Leeds arnd Yorsi 10001.; total, 17,7601. The mill, contrary to many in the worsted district, was working full time, and at least 600 hands have been thrown out of employment by the conflagration. Other 300, chiefly wool-combers, will probably get work through Me6srs. Foster giving theirworkout on commission. "The new mill," to which allusion is made above, will probably be ready In abeut six weeiks, and then the whole or nearly the whole of the hands now out of employ will again be set to work. Mess Poster make large quantities of " lastiDgs," a kind of goods the manufacture of which is usually busiest In the months of November, December, and January Nence the reason why the inill wasorn full time.

THE INDIAN MUTINy RBLIg1F FUND. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIIfES. Sir,-I aIl be obllged by youlr giving publicitEy to the following letter, vhich I have t day received from the Governor-General of India. I am, air, your obedient servant. THOMAS Q. FINIS 27, C-nor.sket, Dec. L " T}IE RIGHT HON THE LORD MAYOR. "My Lord,-Your Lordship's despatch of the 26th of Amugust last acquainted me that a public meeting was held at the Mansion-house on the 25th of August for the purpose of expreesing sympathy with those who are suffering from tho recent calamitous events in India; that a committee had been formed for the purpose of raising funds to be placed at my disposal for the immediate relief of the most urgent cases of distres ; and that RS. 20,000 (20,000 rupees) had been remitted as a first instalment, to be distributed as might be deemed advisable. " Tour Lordship's subsequent communication, dated the 9th ult., announoes a further remittance of Rs. 80,000 (80,000 rupees), and points out that the object of the fund raised by the committee being more Iimedlaiely for the relief of those whoare not entitled to compensation from the Government, it may be a question for further consideration how far, inthe event of the Government being authorized to administer full relief, the money may be made available for the benefit of those whose means of subsistence may have been impaired or nhnilated. " Your Lordlship also informs mse of the gracious munificence with which the Queen, the Prince Consort, and'other members of the Royal family have contributed towards this benevolent object; of the friendly and prompt generosity Of His Majesty the Emperor of the French and the Imperial Guard; and of the liberality with wbich all cLsss of our own countrymen have come forward with aid for the occadon. " Fmally, your Lordship inquires how, in my opinion, the proceeds of the fund now being collected in England can in future beet be applied to the purpose in view? "I have fist to express, my Lord, on behalf of the Government of India, of the whole European community in this country, and especially of those who have been sufferers 1 by the sanguinary outrages and rapine by which a large part of Eindostan has been and is still unhappily afflicted, our grateful appreciation of the earnest, active, and wide. spread sympathy which your letter records, and I pray your Lordship to convey the offer of our sincerest thanks to those in whose name you write. " Your Lordship is aware that seon after the first out. break of mutiny in May last, and when the disastrous consequences which it could not fail to bring upon individuals became manifest, a committee was formed in Calcutta for the purpose of raising subscriptions to be devoted to the relief of the sufferers, and of distributing the funds thus raised in the most effective manner. The amount sub. scribed In India up to this date is 254,580r. l3a.; the amount expended, 91,834r. 13a.; and the amount remaining unexpended in the hands of the committee is 162,746r. " The objects to which the expenditure of the sub-com. mittee Is at present directed are the foUowing:- " L Board and lodging oan arrival in Calcutta for refugees who are without homes or friends to receive them. "2. Clothing for refugees. "3. Monthly allowances for the supporb of families who are not boarded and lodged by the sub-committee. "4. Loans to sufferers to provide furniture, clothing, &c. "5. Free grants to sufferers for the same purpose. "6. Passage and diet money on board river steamers to all who have not been provided with the same by the Go. vernment. " 7. Loans to officers and others to pay for the passage of thelr families to England. " 8, Free passage to England for the widows and families of officers and other sufferers, including travelling expenses to Bombay and Calcutta. "9. Education of the children of sufferers. "This fund has been raised independently of the Govern. nlent, and is distributed by a sub-committee according to certain rules which have been laid down, subject to the approval of a general committee of subscribers at Calcutta. " The mode in which the distribution is made is shown in the printed reports of the proceedings of the general committee, held on the 5th of August and 3d of September last, copies of which have already been sent to England, and the measures of the sub-committee, so far as they are known to the Government, have been guided by liberality and good judgment, and have give general satisfaction. " The committee applied to the Government for a grant of money in aid of the objects of the fund, but this was declined for the reasons set forth in the letter from the Secretary to the Government of India, dated the 21st idem. The assistance given by the Government has been hitherto confined to the grant of a free passage by the Inland steamers to all women and children proceeding from the in. terior to Calcutta. " The spirit of resistance, violence, and bloodshed, though gradually yielding to the means which have been taken for Its suppression, and especially to the bravery and endurance of our British troops, is not yet subdued; nor is the extent of the privation and suffering which it has already inflicted In distant parts of the country, cut off from com. munication with Calcutta, fuUy known to tho Government. It is therefore impossible to say how large may be the field over which eventually it will be necessary to distribute the funds which your Lordship may transmit. At present no better course can be taken than that which the sub-committee have adopted in dealing vith the funds at their disposal for the benefit of those who are within their reach. This course, therefore, the Government of India wvdi pur. sue in the first employment of the money received through your Lordship, extending their operations to the distant parts of the Presidency in which assistance is required, but which are not easUy accessible to the sub-committee in Calcutta. "In this view Sir John Lawrence, K.C.B,, the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, has been desired to form a separate committee at Lahore (where subscriptions have already been raised) for the purpose of affording relief to those who have suffered loss in the Punjab and the more northerly parts of the upper provinces, including the hill stations of Simla, Mussooree, and Nynee TaL A sum of 25,000rm. has been placed at Sir John Lawrence's disposal for immediate purposes, and more will be remitted when required. Hereafter, when the full consequences of the rebellion have shown themselves, I shall be in a better poea. tion to inform your Lordship as to the purposes to which the liberalityof our countrymen at home can best be turned. In the meantime the money which has been remitted will remain in the Agra Bank at the credit of the Government, bearing interest at the same rate as Is allowed bv the hank on the deposits of the committee. "I have the honour to be, my Lord, your Lordship's most faithful humble servant, " CANNING, "Fort William, Oct. 23." "Governor-General. The followving letter has been issued by the commiittee regarding the numerous applications for relief which they receive on behalf of the wives and families of soldiers who have recently embarked for India for suppression of the mutiny: "Nov. 30. " Sir,-Many applications for relief having been made by or on behalf of the wives and children of soldiers who have gone to India with their regiments, this committee has on several occa- sons giventheir most carefal and anxious consideration to the sabjeot, and it has always been with one result, that it was not in the power of tho committee to give the solicited relief. " The question is, not whether relief ought or ought not to be given, but whether such relief can be properly given out of the fund which has been intrusted to this committee; and the decislon of this question must entirely depend upon the understanding with which the fund was subscribed. 6 We may confidently assert that the prevailing idea which possessed the public mind at the time when the subscription was in active progress was the destruction of life and property in India, and the distress occasioned by it. This feeling was so strongly reflected in the resolution, which were published by this committee on the 26th of September, embodying the conditions on which we were willing to administer such means of relief as might be placed at our disposal, that doubts were enter. taiDed whether the widows and orphans of the Euro. peon soldiers serving In India, who might lose their lives by the casualties of war and clinmate, were intended to be in. cluded, and they were therefore expressly mentioned in the address which was subsequently published by our committee. On the other hand, the case of the wives and children who were left behind in this country (the fathers being still living) was repeatedly urged upon us, and the answer invariably returned was that it did not come within the scope of our fund. We cannot therefore doubt that when the fund was subscribed no such appropriation of It was contemplated, and that our committee holds the fund In trust on that condition. How important this condition it may be seen from the fact that, with a smaller number of wives and chUdren of soldiers, upwards of 100,OOOL was expended during the late Russian war by the Asoda. tion for the Relief of Wives and ChiUdren of Her laesB's Soldiers and Sailors serving in the Ea "Although the reasons why persons of this class were not inluded in the plan of the subscription have no immediate bearing on the point now under consideration, it may be proper to allude briefly to them. "' The object of tbe subscription was to relien ' the dir, tress caused by the mutinies In India.i Now, the distress unhappily prevailing among the wives and children of the soldiers serving in Indi cannot in any proper sense be sid. to bo cased by the mutiny. It was caused by that condL tlon of military life which makes it impossible that the wives and children of soldiers can accompany them on cive service, and the cse would have been the same whether the sat of war was India or Persia, or the Cape of Good Hope, or any other country. In the event of the pacification of Iudia regiments from Bengal might proceed to China, and, although the distress of the women would be in nowise diminished, it would obviously be impossble to contributo towards its relief from a fund which was sub. scribed for the relief of the distress caused by the Indian mutiny. " The wives and childrem of British soldiers fighting tha battles of their country abroad ought, of course, to b objects of the particular care of their countrymen and coutrywomen at home; but the circumstances are such that assistance cau ho given in a more effectual manner and with less probability of moral deterioration by local agency nsing funds usually raised than by means of any general administration. " The wives of the soldiers serving in India, several thou. sands in number, are residing in various parts of the united kingdom. The majority of them probably already have the means of subsistence in the Government allowance, in their own earnings, or in the help of their friends; but some of them, no doubt, stand in need of other assistance. Who the persons of the latter class are, and the kind and degree of assistance that would be proper, is iznown in the respective localities, but could not be ascertained with nearly equal certainty by a central body like the Indian Relief Committee, whatever pains might be taken to sift the facts of the sevorxa cues. In truth, if it were open to all this large dcs of persons to apply for relief out of a general fund administered in London, a great relaxation of. the ordinary motives to industry and economy, besides other moral evils, must ensue. It therefore seems to be desirable that whatever relief may be given should be by means of funds locally raised, and through the agency of [the established legal machinery, or of local associations formed in aid of it.

THE BISHOP OF EXETER ON DIVORCE. To mm Vyn. AacHDACoN or BARnSTABLE, Aim Tmx CLxPGY OP THAT AMCORDACONVRYV lDear AIr. .Archdeacon,-I have received your letter of the 21st, together with an address to me from the clergy of five deaneries of your areldeaconry, requesting "my opinion and advice on a subject which greatly disquiets and distreases them," namely, the 58th clause of the "Divorce and Matrimonial Causes" Act, by which any clergyman entitled to officiate within any diocess is authorized to intrude into any other parish of the same diocess for the purpose of performing the marriage service between parties "whose former marriage has heen dissolved on the ground of his or her adultery," whenever the minister of the parish shall have refused to perform the said service. Similar applications have been made to me from ruri4ecanal chapters in other parts of my diocess. and I expect one from the clergy of the archdeaconry of TotneTs, assembled at a general meeting called for.;that purpose by the Ven, the Archdeacon. I request that they will all accept this answer, as directed That I heartUy sympathize with my clergy on this occa. sion they will, I am confident, need no assurance; although in the outset I avow that I do not anticipate that any very grievous evll-perhaps not any practical evil whatever-will resalt from the esactment which has called forth this declara.ion of their feeling. I say practical evil, for undoubtedly the clause is in its principle open to very grave complaint. Itgrcssly violates our parochial system-thab system on which our Church's whole action has hitherto proceeded with the happiest results to the peace and edification of our people. If, therefore, the clause had been inserted on grave deliberation by Parliament, after duly informing itself on the particular matter on which it was legislating, every friend of the Church would be compelled to deplore it as the introduction of a most Ill-omened novelty -of a precedent which could scarcely fail to lead to other and graver violati.ons of principle, issuing, at length, in the disruption of all union between the Church and the State of ut I have no apprehension that Parliament accepted the clause with any such deliberate intention. It was hastily Introduced at the close of a long and wearisome discussion of a much controverted Bill, for the purpose of securing the readier acceptance of a provision which must have been intended as a concession to the conscientious feeling of 8,000 or 9,000 clergy, who had prayed that they might not be required to use the Church's office of holy matrimon3i In cases in which it cannot be used writhout absolute profa- That the 58th clause was hastily, and without due con. sideratlon, introduced and passed would appear from internal evidence, even if we were Ignorant of the history of the proceeding-from the absence, I mean, of any of those provisions which must have accompanied it, if it had been intended to produce the mischief which you with too much reason deprecate. For in that case any cle:gyman whatever would have been permitted to perform the marriage service, intead of " any minister entitled to officiate within the diocess;" in ether words, any incumbent, or licensed curate, or assistant to any incumbent, for ne other is "entitled to officiate," even if he could in any case officiate, without subjecting himself to ecclesiastical censures. This alone is no light security. In truth, I know not, andshouald be very sorry to know, any single incumbent or curate of my diocess whom I could lightly suspect of being either so unmindful of what he owes to his brethren, or so heedless of his own character, as voluntarily to incur the odium, which would most justly attach to a clergymau intrading into the church of another for the purpose of performing a servioe which the proper minister deems unfit to be pef. formed in it. In.particular, with reference to our present subject, no one having the slightest sense of decency or self-respect could hire himself out for the express purpose of calling on "God the Father, God the Son, and God the Eoly Ghost" to bless an union founded on the notorious violation of the marriage vow by one at least of the parties, most conimonly with the partner of her gailt-an union which thus would be little better than one continued life - long adultery; an union which implies an utter abnegation of repentance for past sdn on the woman's part, at least; a flinging to the winds of that "spiritual benediction and grace" which was before Invoked for her, that she and her former partner might "so live together in this life that in the world to come they might have life everlasting." But while I do not anticipate much practical evil from this provision of the recent statute, I am not the less sensible of my duty to do all within my power to co-operate with you in marlking our common reprobation of the prin. ciple involved in it. I therefore here announce to you that no such marriage will in this diocess, during my eplscopate be performed by license. A marriage license is not an instrument which can be claimed as of right. It issues in the name of the bishop, who thereby declares him. self "i lling that the desires of the appHcants may the more speedily obtain due effect without the pubchation of banns." Now, as I cannot truly say that I am thus "willing," I cannot consent to the issuing of a license in such a case in my name, and I rejoice to know that my vicar-general, to whom the power of granting licenses is intrusted by his patent, agrees with me as to the fitness of withholding them n the case of any person divorced for his or her adultery. This will probably have the wholesome effect of confining these marriages to the registrar's office, for it can hardly Be imagined that any woman who retains the slightest particle of womanly modesty will choose to have her shame proclaimed again and again in the House of God at the time of public worship and in the hearing of all the people, who aro thereby invited to declare whether they " know any cauze or just impediment" why she and her paramour shouli not be joined together in holy matrimony. This very phrase, "holy matrimony," suggests another grave consideration. Is the marriage of a divorced woman forbidden by God's law? I do not say that itis; but neither do I venture to say, in the face of great authority to the contrary, that it is not. But if it is, the recent statute which makes such marriage lawful in spite of God's law does not make lawful the solemnization of it in the house of God. For the Act of Uniformity not being repealed the new Act must be so construed as shall make it consistent, where it is possible, with the former; but the former, speakdng in the rubric, says that IIif at the day of marriage anY maan do allege the Impediment of its being contrary to God's law and put In a caution (to the full value of the charges), then the solemnization must he deferred until such. time as the truth be tried." How this trial is to be had, in what court, and by what process it Is for lawyers to say. It is enough for me to cint the words of the law itself. But neite.r is this al. I apprehend that, if to marry a divorced woman is "forbidden by God's word," such marriage solemnized In church Is unlawful, and being unlawful is elso absolutely void. Bp e that it is unlawful the Prayer-book, which is part of the Act of Uniformity, expressly declares; or it requles the minister to say "unto the person that shall be married," "Be ye wellasured that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Wordl doth allow are not joined together by God; neither is their matrimnony lawful." When, therefore, the 57th section of the new Act says that when any marriage shall have been declared by "1the Court for Divorce and Matrimonia Causes" to be dissolved, "it shall be lawful for the respective parties thereto to marry again, as if the prior marriage had been dissolved by de-ath," this must be made consistent with the Act of Uniformity, and can only be so made by the new marriage being contracted as a civil contract, with all the civil effects of marriage, before the registrar, without wor disnyhirsontrry to anYtbing in the 5gth secton, which requtires "any minister of any church who shall refuse to perform the marriage service to permit any other minister," within the description there givenx "1to performn such service." For this permission is to be given only in the case of "Iany persons who buLt for such refusal would be entitled to have the same service performued in such church or chapel;" and certainly no persons can be entitled thereto if the marriage be "forbidden by the Wordl of God." It follows, therefore, that if the position which has beena maintained by ma-ny very learned divines of very high character, with no mean show of argument-a position, too, which is In strict acordance with what is stijl the canon law in England, and was the temporal law from time immnemorialtill within these three moniths,-namnely, that to mryadivorced woman is "Iforbidden by the Word of od"-lt, follows, I say, that if this position betu had the onus of proving it to be untrue sems to rest wihtoq 'Who dany what tho Church'slaw has Always hithato ze eelved) the only oertan way in which suoh a marriage can legally be contracted at allis by the paztescontenting themsewes with marrying before the registrar. I am sorrYto have extended the statemient of mJ oDinA at your request, to so great a length; but I coui not satisfy myself without giving the reasons for what I have said in myopinion-that the mischief which you deprecate is not at all likely to be of much practical importane. Having thus largely stated my opinion, I may be allowed to oonsider lengthened "advice ' unneessary. On the only specified particular in which you ask my advicenamely, whether you should pledge yourselves not to intrude into the parishes and churches of your brethren in such cases as the mew Act contemplates, without hesitation, I advise you not to do yourselves the injustice of appearing to think such a pledge necessary, any more than it is necessary for you to pledge yourselves not to commit any other very discreditable action. There is another point on which you seem to wish my advice, though you do not directly ask it,-whether you should make '. an appeaP to Her Majesty, in order to " prevail on her to withhold for awhile the order in Council which alone can bring the act into full operation." Here I have no difficulty whatever in saying that I advise you not to pray Her Mjesty to nullify an Act of Parliament, which, as such, is her own act-" in order that time may be allowed, in consideration of the scruples of the lergy, for so far altering the provisions of the Act as to enmove the obnoxious clause." I should hardly advise you Fo to pray Her Majesty, even if it were necessary for the t uggested purpose of obtaining time. But, in truth, if the Act be called into operation at the earliest posdble period, there must be abundant time for making any alterations before the obnoxious clause can be acted upon. Parliament is on the eve of meeting; therefore the time for introducing a Bill to meet your wshes ix likewise on the point of commencing. Meanwhile, the Act cannot be bronght into use untUl a month after an order in Council, which has not yet issued. Not till the Act has commenoed can the Court constituted by it do anything whatever. Before it wiU receive any cause it must " make rules and regulations for practioe and procedure;" must "fix and regulate the fees payable on all proceedings before it;" and must make their rules and regulations and fees sufficiently known. These and other necessary preliminaries mnst take some considerable time; but not till allthis be done can a single petition be even received; then time must be given for itsbeing answered, for witnesses on both sides being summoned, for the cause being heard, decided, and sentence pronounoed. How many monthsall these matters mayurequre those only whoare accustomed to the proceedings of courtsin similar ases can be qalified to say. Bat be theeo months many or fe-a, stil three months longer must be iven for appeaagainst the decision, and not til after thege last three months shaU have elapsed, even though there be no appeal, can the parties, if divorced, marry again. You must see, therefore, that there will be abundant time for introducimg, discusing, passing through Parliament any Bil to amend the clause complained of, long before that clause can possibly oome into operation. But I frankly own that I am not in favour of your hazarding any ainend. ments of the clause, great as the reasonable objections to it in its present state my be. For the evil of it, bo it great or small, has been already inflioted, in the principle, nthe precedent, in the shock given to our Church's system. Bat Its actual operation must be so limitea that it can do very little harm; and I ventuib-to predict that the youngest of you wil never have to complain of a single Instance of intrusion under it.- ItftV if the clergy set about a Bill to ameakd. tEl6 law' are you quite sure that it will come out of Parliament with the amendments which yon wish and have devised? Say it not happen that your- "Bill to amend" will itself be amended in .A manner which might perhaps startle Yoti? Remembering the character of some of tha disecssions whl1e the Act itself was before Parliament, the tone and temper exhibited in quarters where they ought to have been least expected, the sphiit evoked and most imperfectly laid, I am inclined to recommend that you should "rather bear the ills 'yo have than fly to others which you know not of." If this long answer indicate something of the garraLity and extreme caution of fourscore, it will at least show that I have given to your addresses that serious attention which you have a full right to expeot from your bishop on aograve an occason. Believe me, Ven. and dear Mr. Archdeacon, and rev. and dear brethren, with earnest prayer for God's grace to aid both you and me in all our difficulties and tril, your affectionate friend and brother, H. EXETR P. S.-Since this letter was written I have soen a copy of the address to me now in the course of signature from the clergy of the Arcbdeaconry of Totness. I fully recognize in it the zeal and talent, as well as faithfulness, which would be expected to characterize any such paper from that body. If it had reached me earlier I should have applied my ob. servations with more special reference to several portions of it. But I trust that they will forgive me if I now eontent myself with referring them to what I have written above. I have also heard that a meeting has been holden on the same subject by a body of men in London whom I, in com. mon with all English Churehmen, regard with most sinoere respeet. If, as is not Imrprobable, I may have expressed opinions in some particulars at variance wth theirs, I am certain that the difference can only be as to the best means of attaining the same end-the peace, security, and strength of our Holy Church.

THIE BISHoP OF ExEzm-The burial board of St. Thomas, near Exeter, met on Monday, and unanimously adopted a petition to Parliament, praying that the recent Actrelating to burial grounds might be so amended as to got rid of what was termed a " quibble" which the Bishop of Exeter has raised, and under which he refuses to consecrate the new cemetery of St. Thomas. It appears that this cemetery has been ready for iuterments for several months, but the bishop some time ago refused to consecrate it in consequence of the burial board's decision not to erect a division wall of four feet in height. When the new Act was passed the board thought there could be no objection on the parb of the bishop to consecrate, and they announced to his lordship that the. ground was in a fit state for consecration. The cemeterv adjoins the old churchyard, and a mud wall formerly divided the two. This mud wal the burial board, with the approbation of the parishioners, threw down, which much improved the appearance of the place. The Bishop of Exeter, however, now refses to consecrate the cemetery unless the mud wall is restored, grounding his refusal on the 18th section of the 18th and 19th of Victoria, which grovides that the old burial grounds shall be maintained in necent order, and al necessary rpairs to the walls and fences thereof shall be executed. The consequence of this refusal is that the rector of the parlsh is unable to officiate at the funerals of deceased members of the Church of England, but the parish clerk has done so In many instances. PxgsoxA L nnry x FitACE.-A very painful occurrence has lately happened at St. Etienne, which the French papers are, I believe, prohibited from alluding to. The son of a senator residing there married, about two years since, the daughter of a rich chymistinthetown. At the end of two months they eeparated. The daughter returned to her father's house, where in due time she was delivered of a child, now thirteen months old. She frequently walked about Sb. Etienne with the child and its nurse. It appears that her father-in-law, the senztor, lately formed the design of getting this child into his own custody, and with that object caused her to be followedby the police during her walks. He had succeeded in persuadiug the chief commissioner of police of the town to aid him in the project. One day last week the lady in question was walkidg through the galleries of the museum at the Hotel de Voe, accompanied by her servant with the chUd, when a polce agent came up to tell her that a person was walting to speak to her down stairs. She went outside the building, and during her absence tba child was taken away. When she found the trick that had been layed upon her she uttered piercing cries, and to silence ter was thrust into a room in the Hotel de Ville, where she was for some time kept a prisoner. Ultimately she escaped into a garden, separated from the street by an iron railing, through the bare of which she told her story to the passers by. An immense crowa assembled, and it was feared at one moment that an attack would be made upon the Hotel de Ville. The people were, however, appeased by the release of the lady, who has applied to the courts of law for the restoration of her child. Meanwhile the Government has dismissed the Commissary of Police, whose conduct had so nearly led to an attack by the mob on the Prefect's resldcnce. The Prefe^t was wholly innocent in the matter.- Express. -I TnE SUSPrMDED BAs IN ScoTLAND.-A deputation, consisting of noblemen and gentlemen of the west of Scotland, and accompanied by Mr. DalgUsh, member for the city, proceeded again to Edinburgh yesterday (Friday) on the affirs of the suspended banks. The con. versatUon that took place with the Edinburgh bank directors was confidential, but the general result may be stated, and that is that the Edinburgh banks are prepared to enter into liberal and ascomnaodating terms for the liquidation of the Western. Their large and, under the measures adopted, daily increasing claims againat the Western as creditors will soon enable them, of course, to take steps to liquidate without asklng any one's permission. A proposition was to have been made with respect to the city, but it was postponed to a more convenient season, this being part, apparently, of the policy. The two banks should come to an immediate understanding with each other. If both cannot open without further delay, one may with the aid of the other, and be of great service in the meantime to the business of the town and country, as well as to the interests of the one that remains in suspension. Very unfavourable reports, we may add, are circulated with respect to the position of the Western.- Glsgow Daily Mail.

TIB UTAH EXPEDITIO2N. The NeMw York Trib2 ue publishes the following communlcation from its special correspondent with the Utah expedition. He dates his letter from Camp 260 miles from Fort Laramie, October 13:-- " Durng Captain Van Vliet's xta in SBat Lake City lst month he overheard but one remark which induced him to believe that the declarations by the Mormons ofan intention to resist the troops were not earnest. That was an observation Brigham Young, to the effect that his intention was = tered Iunles he should get another revelation to the contrary, which he was sure be should not.' The result has certnly justified the Prophet's oonfidence. No such revelation had been recelved by him up to October 5, on whieh date acts were committed under his direction which cannot fll to endin bloodshed. On that day the two rzgiments of Infantry and the artillery and ordnanco batteres were encamped on Ham's Fork, which branches from Blek's Fork, which is a fork of Green River. The two nearest sapply trains were but a few miles ditant from Green River, on the east bank, and about 30 miles from ColonelAlexander's camp. The next on the road had advanwed about 20 miles west from Pacific Springs, which rise at a short distnoe beyond the South PaES. About 11 o'clock At night these three trains were surprised and seized by parties of llormons, their contents examined, and what was worthpillaging mwa stolen and the remainder destroyed by fire. Each train consis of 26 waggons, and belonged to the number sent out by Mesrs Rusell and Waddell cf Leavenworth City, contractors for thetransportatlon of stores to the army and for the supply of beef cattle. The team. sters made no resstane, and were unbarmed. These Mormon bands are understood to be under the command of 'BilP Hickman, although it is rumoured that Heber C. Kimbal attends them. They are al well mounted and armedr each man being provided with a California horse and ith a rifle, and from one to three revolvers. lickman Is supposed to have directed the proceedings near Pacific wirings, whle a man named Lcksmnith commanded near "Immediately upon the receipt of the mews of this attack Colonel Alexander ent Captain Marcy, of the 5th Infantry. with five companies, back to Green River. He arrived, however, only in time to take charge of the cattle of the trains which the Mormons had left, with the polite request that the troops would fatten them over winter, when they would be in good condition for Mtormon eating in the spring. Another of their jeuz d'esprit was a remark to the teamsters that they ' bad only burnt the waggons this time, but would be likely to burn the waggoners the next.' Colonel AlexAnder also sent despatches to Brevet6 Colonel Smith, from whose camp I am wrting, and Captain Marcy sent by anotber messenger a circular letter to the trains on the road, advising them, for the sake of safety, to place themselves under Colonel Smith's protection. Both express men were intercepted by the Mormons, but~ as nothing suspicious was found on their persons, and it did nct appear on what errand they were bound, theTy were released. The one from Colonel Alexander, peroeiving that it was impossible to avoid arrest, destroyed the despatches to Colonel Smith, according to his iustractions, and we sare Ignorant of their contents. The other brought Captain Marcys circular safely through in the toe of his mocain. * 'Awe know, however, in the aheence of the official espatchcs, that Captain MIrcy has rejoined Colonel Alex nder, and that the entire force has moved to the north along Bear River towards Soda Springs, where it Will probably await the arrival of the remaining supply trains, the sutlers' trains of the the 5th and 10th nfantry, and of Colonel Smith's battalion. The reasons for this movement do not appear by a glanco at the map to a person 'unacquainted minutely with thd conformation of the country and the character of the climate. The direct road to Salt Lake City, passing Fort Bridger, Medicine Butte, and the Needles, which Co onelAlexander has abandoned, is possibly by this time impassable to wa ons or artiUery on accou nt of the weather. The season, which has been uncommonly favourableupto the be_inning of October, has resumed Its natural severity. i'ce has formed in our buckets every morning bat ono since we left Fort Laramie. The northern slopes of the mountains amr completely whitened with a covering which will not melt till , and even the southern slopes are powdered scantily with snow, of which there was a fail on Saturday night that chilled our road on Sunday and Monday, and has muddied i to day. The Mormons have probably burnt the grass along that entire route, and obstructed the defiies in which it abounds in such a manner that only artillery could clear them. But If the army concentrates at Soda Springs it will have before It a road alon_ a valley, open, it is said, even at midwinter direct to Salt Lake City. Iknow of no chartwhich exhibits all the lines of road on which these movements will be made; and, indeed, I am unable to gather from our guides sach information as to trace them accurately on Captain Stansbury's map, which is the largest cbart of this country that I possess; but I believe them to be substantially these --The direct route from California to the States crosses the Wabsatch Mountains far to the north of the Salt Lake City, and continues almost due eut to its junction with the main road to that city, which passes Fort Bridger, and then runs on through the Sonth Pass, dividing, however, near Ham's Fork into three branches, which cross the Green River and unite boyond the Big Sandy. From one or the other of these branches a road leads up into Orogon towards Fort Hall, passing Soda Springs, from which, at the springs, there is a cut off into a road direct from Fort Hall to Salt Lake City. It is over these latte~ roads and the cat-off that Colonel Alexander's march will be directed. "The Mormons who intercepted the express men told them that they had a force of 700 men scattered along through the mountains as far east as the Devil's Gate, through which the Sweetwater flows, about 200 miles from Fort IAramie, and near which is a dismantled Mormon mail station, at a fire from some of the logs of which we warmed our feet not a week ago. But this mnst be a gross exaggeration. Neither of the parties which burnt the trains exceeded 100 in number, and i iS dfficult to eonceive how a force of even that strength could have gained the rear of the rmy unobserved. It is a fact, however, that ever since the Mormons settled on Salt Lake they have been assidnous in collecting information conoerning the topography of the country, and many of their leaders understand it as thoroughly as the most experienced mountain guide. The employment of a great part of their young men in herding cattle has made them acquainted vwth every little stream and 'kanyon,' and inured them to the saddle. It is these young men, and these almost solely, who constitate the element of Mormon bnilitary forcefrom which there is danger to be apprehended. They possess the ability, if they have the will, to carry on an annoying guerilla rfare, sweeping down from moantain,peases upon single travellers and unprotected trains. ' am unable to makean estimate of the amount of stores destroyed by them in their foray of O~tober 5. The original amount intended for the Utah expedition was an eight months' supply for 2,500 men, and each train was assigned a proportion of all the articles to be transported, including even Ordnance stores. Whether different arrangements were made when it was thought necessary to leave the 2d Dragoons with GovernorWalker in Kansas I am not aware. At any rate, it is the general impression that the loss of so great a quantity of provisions as the 72 waggons must have contained would necessitate a movement towards Salt Lake Valley, were not such a movement on other accounts a consequence of their destraction. The season will forbid the transmission of any further supplies or troops from the east thanaare now Ireadyfar on their way. Whether Colonel Sumner's command has returned from its pursuit of the Cheyeunes to the Arkansas; whether Colonel Cook is marching his dragoons towardsus to fll out so far as is nowposable the original programme of the army of Utah, which was disturbed by Governor Walker's schemes in Kansas; or whether General Harney, Colonel Johnson, Governor Cumming, or any of the new territorial officials are on their way west, we are not informed, for the most recent advices we have received from the east extend no later than to September 1. Ignorant as we are of what may have occurred there during the last 40 days, it is impossible for us to fix the responsibility for the delay, so acurately as yourselves, upon those on whom it belongs but some one is certamily to blame for the fact, that of the 2,500 men originally destined to the expedition hardly 1,400 are now available, and for the other fact, that of all the newly appointed territorial officals only one to my knowledge (Chief Justice Eckels) is anywhere near his post of duty. Mro Morrell, the Postmaster of Salt L ake city, who wnas appointed by President Pierce haRt yesar, hut w hose commission was stolen from the mall, is also an exception. He is encamped near the South Pass, and will place his waggons under Colonel Smnith's protection " This news of the actual rising of the Mormons in arms cannot surprise you more than It does those on the scene of action. Thepresence of Dr. Bernhisel with Captain Van Vlet on his journey to the States seemed of itself an offset to all the threatening messages of which the latter was the bearer. It seemed incredible that the Mormons should have the assurance to send a delegate to Washington to uphold them in Congress, when they were in actual armed rebellion. That they hive been excited to a forcible outbreak only by the grossest misrepreseutationS I cannot doubt. As an Instance ofthese. I may specify one which is by no means the most absurd. When the general orders from the headquarters of the army for Jtah for the establishment of tnhree new posts inthe territory reached Salt Lake City, tue circumstance that they were to be ' double ration posta excited the utmost indignation. Supposing it meant that all the garrisons, as well as the commanding officers, were to draw double rations, laughable as it may appear, it is a fact that they believed that the extra ration was to be farnished to each soldier to enable him to marry and support a wife, whom, of course, he would seduce from among them. Captain Van Vilet found this illusion universally prevalent. "In consideration of the journey of Dr. Bernhisel to Washington, while affairs are in such a condition among his constituency, I feel bound to send you the following information concerning the mode of his election, for the accuracy of which I do not vouch,-for ib is not of my personal knowledge-hut for which I send you privately my authority. It has been stated tome that on the Sunday before the day fixed by law for the election Brigham Young rose in the Bowrery, where an audience of several thousands was collected, and spoke substantially to this "'Brethren, tomorrow, you know, is the day to vote for delegate to Congres, so the law says. But I don't see why to-day isn't just as holy, and why we shouldn't take a vote to-day. Brother Bernhisel, brethren, has done wet enough in Congress, though nobod 's of much nse there. and if it's worth while to send anybodry to Washington I guess we might as well send him back; if ho can't dous any good, he won't do us n harm. So all you that are in avour of sending Brother Iernhlsel backwill please .' "Atoordingy the whole audience rose. The next day at thEeelection but few votes were cast, and those all for Dr. Bernhlel, it being felt to be usles to op him, although, he is said to be very unpopular int Salt Lak0Cty. If I do Dr. Bernhiel y wrong by thig narration, I am sm youwill be wlling to oorrect anything which h shiall prove to be inaccurate, " As another item which I have neglected to insert inits proper connexion, it is reported that the Mormons have tlken prisoners two men belonging to DBr. Manrwls party, who lere went on businees towards Salt Lake City."

THE CALCUTTA VOLUN TRPS. (From the Daily ewbs.) Yesterday was a grand day for the Calcutta Volunter Guards. This "modern formation" consists of artillery, cavalry, and infantry, In all not fewer than 900 mnen, and, considering the very short time they have been embodied, their martil bearing is surrrlsing. Lady Canning presented the infantry with colours, and the cavalry with standards. Her Indyship arrived on the ground on horseback at 5 p.m., accompanied by the Governor.General, the Commander.in-Chief, Generals Windhas and Beatson, and a numnerous and briliant sAL Lady Canning's address was as follows - " Calcatta Volunteers,-I have great plessure In present ing you these colours I"The readiness with which you came forward at a time of trouble and anxiety, and sacrificed your leisure, your ease, and the comforts of your honmes on behalf of the safet of the pablic, and the zeal with which you have applm yourselves to the study and discharro of your self*lhposen duties, amsure me that these Brit6h colours will be confided to trustworthy hands. " Take them, and remember that it behoves you to guard and defend them zealously, and by ready attention to your daties, by strict and unhesitating obedience to your oom. manding officers, and by cheerful submission to discipline, to raise and sustain the character of your corps, and keep unsaTlied the honour of your coloura." Major Turnbull, the commandanb, replied - "LadyCanning,-lI the name of the VolunteersIhave to thank you for the honour you have conferred on us in presenting these colours, an honour fuUy appreciated by every member of the Calcutta Volunteer Gaards. " Although the tide of events has turned favourably, so that in all probability the Volunteers may never be caUed upon for active service; yet, should they ever be, judging from the high tone and soldierly bearing pervading 1 ranks, I am convinced that they are not only ready, but capable and willing, to do good services. "Every encouragement has been afforded to the Volunteers by the Governor-General graciously acceding to the requistions that have been made for their improvement We are now favoured with an additional and lasting one by these colours being presented by your Ledyship, which, confided to their care, the Volunteers will defend to the last, on all occasions, with true devotion and loyalty. Again r beg to repeat our thanks in the name of the CalcuttaFgolaun beer Guards." I have known Calcutta for many years, but I never saw anything approaching the gathering that did honour to this occasion. I think there could not have been fewer than from 20,000 to 25,000 persons present, embracing all classes of Europeans and natives. After the above expression of the corps' sense of Lord Canning's gracious desire to meet Its wishes in every way, one cannot but regret that his Lordship's alleged cord rojection of the proposal for embodying the force has been one of tho many groundless complaints in one or two of the petitions for his recall, in getting uji which many of the olunteers took a very active part. it is true, that the two positions are not strictly contradictory, but the zeal which it is now admitted he has shown in favour of the corps may be received as conclusive evidence that he agreed to its for. ination as soon as he deemed it advisable. As tothis recall, we hear much less of it than we dida month ago. I believe the feeling is not, and has not been, against the GovernorGeneral so much as against the system of government he administers, and that it has been thought a cry for his recall would be taken as an additional emphasis of public discontent,
SAUGOP.. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As the only'part of India about which much anxiety was felt after the arrival of the last tele_ram was Sanzor, it may be a relief to many who have no eaTd from their friends there if you will publish the following extract from a letter from an officer of the 31st Native Bengal Infantry, now doing duty at Saugor, and still faithful t its colours. The officer alluded to commands a division within the fort. The extract, dated October 20, is as follows ; speaking of the sentries, he says:-" I fear they are rather slack some times, knowing that t'ere is no enemy near us who dare come within reach of the guns."

Tim RoYAL SocrETY.-The anniversary meeting of the Fellows of the Royal Society was held on St. Andrew's day in their now rooms at Burlington-house. The President, Lord Wrottesley, in delivering his annnal address, noticed the advances made by science since the previous anniversary, particularly as relates to terrestrial magnetism and geograpical research. Adverting to General Sabine's discovery of the correspondence of the decennial period of the maxima and minima of magnetism with that of the revolution of the spots on the sun's surface, and to his investigation of the law of " nagnetic storms," his Lordship pointed out the advantage to science that might be expected to accrue from an expeditioon to make a series of observations at the mouth of the M. kenzie river, on the coast of Arctic America, as in that latitude will probably be found the neutral point betwean the easterly "storms" or "disturbances" at Point Barrow and the westerly at Toronto. Government are to be askei to send out a small party to settle this interesting question. Lord Wrottesley announced, with reference to the geograz. phical question, that Government have promised to send a vessel to explore the Zambesi, in conjunction with Dr. Livingstone, who will return to Africa in the course of the present month. The medals in the gift of the society where then presented; the Copley medal to fchel Eugene Chevreul, for his researches in organic chymistry, particalarly on the composition of the fats, and for researches on the contrast of colours. One of the Royal medals to Dr. Edward Frankland, for the isolation of the organic radicals of the alchols, and for hIs researches on the metallic derivatives of alcohol; the other to Dr. John LindUey, for his numerous researches and worlca in all branches of scientific botany, and especially for his Vegetadk Kingdonm and his Gencra and Species of Orchideor.
