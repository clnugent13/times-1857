THEIMPBBRIAL MBBTINGAT STUTTGART. ---------- im- (Fnom oup. srFciAL coRRir--PoxDrw-r-) STUTTGART, SErT. 27 The first sounds that the inhabitant of Stuttgart, and "the stranger that dweUeth within its gates," hear of a morning are the tones of sacred music floating down from above through the still morning air, and inspiring a feeling of devotion and elevation of spirit which none but those who have experienced its effects before the hurry and bustle of the day have commenced can fully appreciate. The m'uezzin that thus appeals so early to the German spirit of devotion is generally a brass band of some six or eight musicians, employing the energyoftheirlungs on horn, trumpet, and trombone; and from their elevated position on the external gallery at the base of the church steeple their music certainly obtains numerous, if not respondent, hearers. This morning being that of the King's birthday, the effect of tis brazen call to early prayer was speedily dissipated by the firing of 101 guns in honour of His Majesty's 76th birthday+, and this noisy martial performance was soon again succeeded by the souuds of various bands of regimental music marching through the streets to their several destinations; but these spirit-stirring strains were allowed to subside into silence as the time for Divine service approached. To-day has been Sunday, but the Sabbath has brought no rest either to the Emperors or to the Emperor-gazers ; for the latter more particularly the day has been excessively arduous. The Emperor Napoleon attended Divine service in the Catholic church, the Emperor of Russia in the Greek chapel of the Russian Embassy and the King of Wurtemberg with his Court at tihe Protestant Stifts Kirche; at the latter a Pe Deaim was sung in acknowledgment of the King's birthday, of which the external world was made acquainted by the firing of 25 guns. The ordinary earthenware of mortalitv in the streets, that had already seen the porcelain of Royalty drive out to its devotions, stayed patiently to witness its return to the Palace, and, after further due exertion of patience, was enabled to see it set out again after luncheon to inspect the preparations now being made for the Volk'est, to be held at Cannstadt to-morrow. The great card of the day, however, was the gala opera in the evening, if an Englishman may be permitted the Hibernianism. The performance was Balfe's Buhemian Girl, put excessively well on the stage, and on the whole sung well, though, as usual with Germans, the singers were deficient in volubility in the rapid passages, and the temlpi were invariably dragged where they ought to have been tak-en very brisk. For the student of British costume, moreover, it was an interesting novelty to have presented to his view Highland maidens dressed not only in kilts, but provided with sporaus and philabegs after the most approved pattern of the Scotch mountaineer at a tobacconist's shop door; but, on the other had, the absurdly foppish character of Lord Allcash was converted into a verv bearable individual, and this we will hope was done out of Consideration for our country, -which may be supposed to be somnewhat sensitive on the subject of this reunion of Monarchs within the precincts of Stuttgart. The Kapellmeister lucken, who conducted on the occasion, had introduced into the opera a whole scene for Devilshoof and his Gipsy band, the music and words of which were pretty enough, but contributed in no way to advance the action of the piece, or render the plot less obscure than the author left it. Taking the performance, however, all in all, due honour was done to our countryman's composition. As is USUal at those theatres on the continent which are the property of the Crown, tha only persons allowed to witne:.s the gala performances on specially festive occasions are admitted to them by the tacit permission or the special irvitation of the King, or his Chamberlains acting for him. To your correspondent, and to the representatives of the more considerable journals on the continent, I have every pleasure in stating that the most admirably selected Dlaces for both seeing and hearing were with the greatest readiness and k-indness allotted by Baron von Gall, the King's Chamberlain and Director of the Theatres. On such nights as these the Court theatres present an unusually brilliant sight, and this was particularly the case to-night with the Stuttgart Theatre, which is admirably built for about 1,800 persons, and so constructed that everybody can see well, hear well, and be seen. The first few rows of the pit were devoted to military officers, the next two or three behind to the higher civil officers of the Government, then those that followeed to the specially invited, and last of all came the merely permitted visitors, while every inch of standing room all round and in the orchestra was densely occupied. The first tier of boxes was devoted almost exclusively to ladies in every variety of the most brilliant costume,a profusion of jewels sparkling on the bust, arms, and heacldress of each; while the only members of the ugly sex permitted to disfigure this rich display of colour and form were princes nearly allied to Royalty, the Ministers of State, the corps diplmzatitue, the noblemen of the suites of the Emperors Alexander and Louis Napoleon, the Queens of Greece and of the -Netherlands, and the highest functionaries of the Court of Stuttgart. If it is borne in mind that the smaller the State the more gorgeous the official costumes of its Court are, and that the highest members of the French, Russian, Bavarian, Greek, Dutch, and Wurtemberg Courts were here assembled, in addition to the c'~rps dipio'rnatique and the highest nobility in this country, itwill be readily conceived that the splendour of the stars and orders, bullion, lace, and. Jewels, brilliant uniforms, and exquisite toilettes here exhibited was sufficient to eclipse even the usually unequalled charm of female personal beauty. The splendour of the scene, however, attained its climax on the arrival of the King and Queen of Wurtemberg and their guests, for up to that time the large Royal state box in the centre of the premier tier and the two Royal proscenium boxes remained empty. The King entered first, and, on advancing alone to the front ofthe box, was saluted by as long, loud, and hearty a Iwr.h as it has ever been my fate to hear, for, without intermission or relaxation, it must have lasted full three minutes; and while each voice was thus putting forth its tribute, the King looked down on the unusually animated and brilliant scene with a glance and a smile of kind satisfaction, but, in hia quiet, undemonstrative manner, made no further recognition of it than by a gentle wave of the hand. He seemed to look on it as only his due for a long reign of incessant and successfuil endeavours to improve the state of his country and the prosperity of his people. When the King had retired from the front, and the various members of the Royal and Imperial families had taken their seats in this and the two proscenium boxes, the splendid scene became almost dazzling, for the glitter and blaze of jewels, gold, and the brightest hues of colour, increased as they were by this last arrival, were further enhanced by the high rank of the potentates assembled and an indistinct impression on the part of the spectator that this meeting, which will ever form a most memorable epoch in the history of Wurtemberg, will not fail to exert some influence on the future constellations of politics in Europe. The order in which the august party occupied the front of the box on taking their seats was in this wise:-The Emnnpress of Russia and the Queen of Greece occupied the centre, the Empress being on the right; to the left Ot tne Queen o0f Greece sat the Emperor of Russia, and to his left the Queen of Wurtemberg; to the right of the Empress of Russia sat the Emperor Napoleon, and to his right again the Queen of the Netherlands; a little removed behind this front line, the King of Wurtemberg took his seat between the Emperor Napoleon and the Empress of Russia. One proscenium box was occupied by the Grand Duchess Helena, with Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, who had only arrived that afternoon, the Crown Prince of Wurtemberg, and the Grand Duchess Olga; the other by the Countess of Neipperg and the Princess Friedrich of Wurtemberg, two daughters of the King, together with certain gentlemen whom I could not recognize. I trust that the unusual nature and the extraordinary brilliancy and splendour of this concentration of rank, power, and wealth will justify the particularity with which I have put before you the details of the picture. At the conclusion of the first act the Emperor and Empress of Russia left the house with their sister, the Grand Duchess of Olga, and her husband the Crown Prince; the rest of the party, however, remained till quite the end; and the order in which they occupied places was, that the Emperor Napoleon took the Emperor of Russia's place between the Queens of Wurtem- berg and Greece, and the King of Wurtemberg took his between the latter and the Queen of the Netherlands. During the first act the two Emperors gave evident signs of being excessively fatigued, heated, and bored; but perhaps it is not worth while to look for any deeper reason for that appearance and the Emperor of Russia's early withdrawal than the natural results of the fatigues they are daily undergoing, and a dinner for 208 persons from which they had just come. After the Emperor and Empress of Rus6ia had left the feeling seemed to be less languid and the conversation more animated. In one of my recent letters I mentioned that the Prince of Prussia was coming here on Sunday to congratulate the King on his birthday. This was at the time confidently looked forward to in conformity with advices received from Berlin and Coblentz. This he has, however, not done. As he had already greeted the Emperor Louis Napoleon at Baden, that motive for coming hither had ceased to exist, and, if it has been proposed here merely with a view to birthday congratulations, I am inclined to think the idea has been discouraged, and from certain remarks that have fallen within the precincts of the Palace I assume that they wanted his room more than his company inboth the figurative and literal senses. The same remark applies to the Grand Duke of Baden, who was spoken of as about to come on the same day. The King of Bavaria, too, who was as confidently expected, did not come, though he sent his brother, Prince Luitpold. Of the Princess Mathilde Bonaparte nothing further has been heard, that she is coming or not; the expected visit appears to have gone off in the mannser so frequently deacribed by the phrase " there's many a slip 'twix;t the cup and the lip." In the midst of all the grand doings at the Court just now, where an event of more or less importance to Europe is taking place, the Minister of Great Britain is absent from his post, whether intentionally or not I have not heard; and so our nation is represented here at this moment by a Secretary of Legation, elevated for the nonce into a Charg6 d'Affaires, and whose anything but imposing appearance and coatume and want of official rank leave him in a state of total eclipse when in the presence of the brilliant, highly titled, gold-bedizened representatives of other Courts. British capital, energy, and taste are, however, represented here by Hancock, the jeweller, of B3ond-street, who appears to have constituted himself purveyor of brilliants, &C., to all the crowned heads of Europe, and he seems to be satisfied with the result of his conferences; and so, if Balfe has on this occasion gained honour, and Hancock profit, it cannot be said that Great Britain gains nothing by the meeting of all these crowned heads at Stuttgart. STUTTGART, SErr. 28. According to a custom of many years' standing a rolksfest is always held at Cannstadt on the day after the King's birthday. At all times this sight, which is kept among all classes in Stuttgart and the neighbourhood as a grand highday and holyday, is worth any visitor's while going to see, and this year it became more than doubly so from the circumstance that the two Emperors, with their suites,would accompany the King to this his favourite meeting with his people. This volksfest is in our vernacular an Agricultural Show, for the main object of it, under ordinary circumstances, is to be an exhibition of agricultural implements and produce, fruit, flowers, horses, oxen, sheep, and swine, and a distribution of prizes to those fortunate peasant competitors to whom special committees for each of the classes of produce have adjudged them. The whole closes with a race. The drive to Cannstadt at the time of this voll.fest is alone worth a visit to Stuttgart. The way leads one through the Palace-gardens here, admirably laid out with noble foliage and sward, in. terspersed with marble statues and sheets of water, past the Crown Prince's villa, where the Emperor and Empress of Russia have stayed on this occasion, past Rosenstein, the villa built for the Grand Duchess Olga, the King's country-seat Wilhelma, which I have described in a former letter, the road in the neighbourhood of these Royal properties being decorated with sculpture and elegant bridges over the Neckar and its tributaries, till one comes to Cannstadi, a quaint little German town, that is beginning to attain a more than local renown for its mineral springs and the exceUent bathing and therapeutic institutions it contains. Here we found the more prominent houses tastefufly decorated with flowers and sprays of evergreen, the flags of WVurtemberg, France, Russia, and Greece waving in all directions, the girls and women in their very best bib and tueker, and everybody agog with expectation and enjoyment. The wooden bridge that crosses the Neckar was dressed with scarlet banners of the old Teutonic cut, and the long line of passengers over it, including the soldiery, horse and foot, that was to keep the ground; the holyday folks, with here and there a pictuxesque costume from the neighbouring mountain tracts; the prize oxen decorated with garlands of flowers, like the sacrificial victims of olden time; and the horses with their head gear tricked out with gay ribands, formed, with the clear blue sky and the fresh bright sunshine, a scene that might have made a skilful painters fortune. The spot chosen for the show is a large, level, dry piece of ground in the valley of the Neckar, covered with hardy turf, that seemns at one time to have formed the bottom of a lake that has since been I drained by the river and commingled with the Rhine. The horizon was bounded on the left by the vineclad range of the Swabian Alps or the Rauhe Alpen, with the picturesque little village of Geissburg reposing on the crown of a hill in the mid distance, and on the right by the hills that shut out Stuttgart from view, but which are crowned by the Crown Prince's viUa Rosenstein, and the freshly. built Gothic church at Berg. The portal opening on to the chosen arena, and the stands erected on It for the fortunate holders of tickets, were doubtless erections of wood before they were decorated for this feast ; but as seen in their completion they seemed like lofty buildings of Medieval architecture, for which fir twigs had furnished the walls; apples, plums, and other fruits, selected for their similarity of colour and size, formed the architraves and the mouldings;sheaves of golden corn were the minarets; and pumpions, melons, and all bright-coloured luscious-looking fruits formed the accessory decorations; while graceful featoons of hops served to connect the different parts and hide the harshness of the outline. The Grand Stand even ambitiously sported a tall column in the Moorish style, in which the mosaic of fruits rivalled the Alhambra, and whose capital looked as if fit for an Emperor's dessert; this proud fabric of horticultural architecture seemed raising itself up to its greatest height to look over tho neighbouring hills and see if there was anybody stupid enough to stop back at Stuttgart and not come out to see the ro17ksfest. The iRoyal Stand was a sort of pavilion raised about eight feet from the ground, and consisting lof a circular centre and two parallelograms stretching from it as wings with a tent-like roof and waUs that kept off the sun but let through the air; the centre was reserved for the Royal and Imperial party, the wings for the Court and its foreign guests of all nations, while an estrade below was reserved for the Minister of the Interior, who distributed the prizes, and other high officials, to whose office the arrangements of the day were confided. The space for the races, which formed the periphery of the arena, was parted off with strong cords, while the interior of the circle was subdivided for the exhibition of the various articles of produce, cattle, &c. This portion of the exhibition was as much beneath what we can see at home as the rest of it was superior. The ground was kept by a squadron of lancers (Leibgards) and another of the Feldj igers, who act as the King's orderlies. The Royal Stand beginning to fill about 11 o'clock, and by dint of a good deal of most enviable squeezing, soon contained about 400 satisfactorily rounded forms, in the freshest, highest morning costume, that became the fair wearers infinitely better than the brocades, the feathers, and the jewels of the night before. This galaxy of bright forms, this rainbow of brilliant colours was not injuriously affected, but rather relieved by the intermixture of a few military, diplomatic, and Court costumes of the male gender. Among the fairer occupants of the Royal Stand the two Ladies of Honour to the Queen of Greece, in their national costume, attracted still more attention and interest than they did the night before. Over and above the fact that the Emperors and the Royal guests were on this occasion to be present at the volksfest, the circumstance that the Emperors were to accompany the King thither on horseback, with their united briliant suites, conferred an additional interest on this year's show. The King and the Emperor Napoleon left the Palace here with their suites, and met the Emperor Alexander and the Crown Prince at the head of their combined suites at one of the lyelUest * With tbe e:ceptlon of the Grnd Duke of Meokienbo?g. Strelits, the Xiiig 5f Wuztembmg is the oldest of a the sovereigns at present reigning,i and is the only one among them who ever commanded 5n entire a em~c Corps in the wha3 gaMh N^.vIQO I, points on the way to Cannatadt, where the roads from Stuttgart and the Crown Prince's villa unite. Those two cavalcades of brilliant cavaliers, comi prlsing all that is moat grateful to the eye in the region of military pomp and luxury of dress and arms and horses, meeting in that beautiful scenery, under the clear vault of blue aky with an unveiled sun, was indeed a glorious spectacle, one that gained rather than lost by the confusion introduced into the groups by the struggle who should excel in the courtesy of yielding precedence. On this as on every other occasion the Emperor Alexander in sisted on the Emperor Napoleon's taking precedence, as he is, in fact, the senior every way. The two cort6grs at length commingled, after an endless amount of caracoling and rearing, and reining and spurring, and the combined cavalcade proceeded to the scene of the exbibition, preceded bythe mounted Yeomanry of Stuttgart-a force that looks like a squadron of veteran officers, so soldierly, so well uniformed. and so well mounted they were. I need not describe the universal shouting and cheering that ensued on this numerous and pompous cavalcade entering on the racecourse-how thousands of hands and handkerchiefs were set In action at once, together with the throats and lungs of the assembled spectators, and how all the bands of music stationed around the course began playing simultaneously all the different national anthems of the nationalities present. (The Wurtemberg and the Prasrian national anthem is the same as our "God save the Queen.") When the KEng and his guests had joined the Queen and the rest of the occupants of the Royal stand and taken their places, the spectator had a repetition of the grandeur of the night before, only that on this occasion nature and nature's products furnished the accessaries to the picture, more ennobling and elevating than the most successful production of art the previous evening. Though due attention was shown to the dlerence of rank in the occupants of the Royal stand, etiquette appeared not to be so strictly observed, and therefore I omit any notice of the position occupied by each. In that pavilion before me there were grouped in the centre an Empress and three Queens, two Emperors and a King, two Grand Duchesse, and dozens of Royal Princes; in the wings of it were to be found the numerous bearers not only of titles valuable in heraldry, but whose names have been " familiar in our mouths as household words" during the late war. Behind me I could see from my elevated position all the equipages of the Court and its guests ranged in orderly rows, with a kaleidoscope pattern of lackeys, outriders, coachmen, postilions, and grooms in all the colours of the rainbow, the dense and sombre crowd of private carriages, the thousands of pedestrians, each eating grapes, and bidding " Griss Gott" to his neighbours and acquaintances; while below were the long line of peasantry leading their flower. crowned oxen, horses, &c., for which they were to receive the prizes adjudged them; above a clear, bright sky and cloudless sunshine, and all around music, flowers, and fruit. If, as I hope, this description will convey to some of your readers an idea of this unusual and charming scene, I am sure they wiRl easily dispense with any attempt on my part to add any epithets or phrases to convey the impression it made on the spectator. They will conceive it better themselves. I yesterday telegraphed to you that the Emperor Alexander would on leaving here proceed by way of Darmstadt to Weinar, and there have a meeting with the Emperor of Austria and the King of Saxony. This I have still every reason to believe to be correct; at first sight it appears about as improbable a statement as can be, but the explanLation is to be found in this fact, that this arrangement is the result of lengthened negotiations between the two Emperors, and the price of the Emperor Alexander's compliance with the wish of the Emperor Francis Joseph is the retirement of Count Buol from his present post. This statesman has made himself at different times obnoxious to the Emperor Alexander and his father while Austrian Minister in St. Petersburg and London;hence the animosity feltontheRussian side against him. If I am rightly informed Count Buol has already, some little time back, received leave of absence and it may be confidently looked forwarded to tiat after a proper and convenient lapse of time the will apply to be allowed to retire on the plea of il-health. The Emperor and Empress of Russia and Queen of Greece left this afternoon at 4 o'clock. The Emperor at leaving was observed to be in very good spirits, and of his own accord and perfectly unnecessarily he reviewed the troops that were posted at the railway, and put thena through their evolutions. The Emperor Napoleon, on the other hand, does not leave here till to-morrow morning, and then he returns direct to his own dominions. The negotiations that had been afoot with a view to his joining the two other Emperors at Weimar have proved abortive and for, the present at any rate, he will not have any meeting with the Emperor of Austria.;
COURT OF COMMffON COUNCIL. Yesterday a specal Court was held for the purpose of electing by ballot, in conformity with the resolution of the 17th nit., two aldermen and four commoners conservators under the Thames Conservancy act, 1857. There was a very large attendance of the mnembers of both Mr. H. L. TAYLOR moved:- " That prior to the ballot taking place for ai oonseryators to be appointed by this O-ast, the names of such members only be balloted for as ame proposed and seconded, each name to be received withouconament: and any naember upon his name being submited .to tha Court decUling to be included In the ballot will bignify the came by risng in his place." Deputy GODSON.-You are going to turn the Court Into a Quakers' meeting. (Laughter,) Mr. H. L. Taylor's motion was not seconded, Pnd consequently fell to the gound. Mr. ELLIOTr.- beg to ask the Lord Mayor whether the office of Conservtior of the Thames is an office of payment, direct or indirect? The LoBD MAYOR.-I think I can answer that question. It will rest entirely with the commissioners themselves. Mr. FARRIcU'.-Will your Lordship allow me to ask you whether the answer you gave to that question was advised by the law officers of the corporation ? The LORD M&YOR.-It was not.-(After consulting the Rteoorder, who at this moment entered the court.)-I can now answer the question. Our law officer has just advised me that there is no power in the Act of Parliament to enable the Commissioners to remunerate themselves. Mr. MA,srTseEvs.-Will your Lordship inform the Court whether there are any candidates for these important offices? The IOBD nMAYoR.-The Act of Parliarnent has made every member of the Court a candidate. Mr. NossLs.-As the time approaches for the election, and as the mode of election has been ordered to be by a system of ballot, in which the members, as I understand it, will write down the names of those persons for whom they intend to vote, it appears to me very desirable that hon. members should ascertain before they hand in their voting papers whether the gentlemen whose names they set down are willing to undertake the duties and responsibilities of the appointment that await them. (Hear, hear.) For myself, I am anxious to ask the Court whether it be de. sirable or not that other persons should signify their desire to have or to escape these duties. I wish to ask the Court the favour that I may not be called upon to perform the duties of a conservator. If any gentleman will go with me for a moment, I am sure he wil see that it is exceedingly desirable that while I am anxious to escape those duties he should take care to look out for some one who will undertake constantly, faithfully, and zealously to perform the duties and obligations of the appointment. hear.) I trust that hon. members wml take care oefore they give their votes to ascertain whether the persons whose names they put down are wiUing to serve or not. Unless that is done, I apprehendwe may by possibility make a mistake, and if you look to the Act yon will see that the appointment runs for a period of five years. For myself in handing in my paper I shall take care to ask every gentleman whose name I have put upon It whether he is willing to undertake constantly to perform the duties of the office. fHear. hear,) The IORD MAYoR appointed Messrs. Besley, Birkett, Lamb, and Whetham to act as scrutineers. The ballot was then proceeded with, and was kept open an hour. At the termination of the scrutiny, The RECORDER said,-The Lord Mayor instructs me to declare that the election has falen upon Alderman Hale, Alderman Humphery, Mr. Jonathan Thorp, Mr. Joseph l'urnley, Mr. Thomas Henry Fry, and Mr. Thomas Dak,n, deputy. The Court then adjourned.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIfES. Bir,-I write in order to correct a statement made In a late leading article in your paper, which I think is calculated to misrepresent the feelings of my sex in regard to the employment of men In serning articles of ladies dress. I, as well as many of my female friends, have always regarded with disgust the employment of men in such essentially feminine occupations, and should have great eatisfaction -a giving my patronage to those shopswhich would breakthrongh the present evil custom and employ women, reserving a few men only for such heavy duties as porterage, &c. Ear from finding the manner of these "white.oravattod counter-skippers" so attractive, I have often found theti rude and uncivil, which is only less objectionable than t'ne familiarity assumed by many of them. Trusting some new system will speedily be adopted in our ehops which wi^,ll restere to women their proper employ. ment, and so be the means of rescuing many of my sex from misery and want, besides leaving more men at liberty to serve their cou^ntry in this hour of need, I remain.

She brings 34 passengers, among whom are Mr. James Crawford, Her Majesty's Consul from Guadaloupe; Commander de Leon, from Havannah; Lieutenant Davis, from St. Lucia, &c. On freight she has $1,711,360 in specie, or, say, 342,2721. sterling, and a misceUaneous cargo, includmg 288 bags of cocoa from Trinidad. A remittance of goiddust from Carthagena, of the value of $127,000, has come by this steamer, and a large consignment of bark. The news from Jamaica ia in every respect unimportent. The weather was favourable for cultivationl ancd the ensuing crops presented every indication of an abundant yield. A project was on foot for the purpose of erecting a " patent slip" in the harbour of Kingston, and the probable cost estimated at 25,0001. Subscriptions to a large amount bad already been collected. The prospects appeared most encouraging and the promoters very sanguine of success. Captain Cooper has been very active in this affair,and deserves much credit for his exertions. The Legislature was further prorogued to the 20th proximo, and was not expected to assemble til early in November. De Cordora's Mercantile IntelUige7w,er of the 10th of September reports a dull state of business for the preceding fortnight. Small lots of coffee reminaing from the old crop had l.een sold at 44s. to 46s. per 1001b. There had been no arrivals of flour, but the supply in hand was adequate for the season; resales had been made at 38s. per barrel for parcels some little time at market, and a small lot by last arrival had sold at 40s. Sales of Irish butter at ISd.; all the last prime lots of American had gone out of market, and the article was inquired for. Alewives In cargo had sold for 20s. Of fish stuffs there had been six arrivals; the first cargo of codfish coming to a bare market fetched 19s. per 1001b. in tierces, and 20s. in boxes, but subsequent arrivals only made 17s. for tierces, and I 8s. for boxes. Late arrivals of herrings hadnotprovedgood, and the supply of pickled fish was not equal to the demand. Country corn was abundant, and sales quoted at 4a. per busheL There was no cheese at market, either American or English. Pork was duUl; last sales of mess at 122s. The pimento crop was just commencing, and was likely to be a heavy one; market active at 3d. per lb. Another lot of 500 bags of yellow or coolle rice of the cargo last reported from Barbadoes had been sold at 16s., and a parcel of 300 bags of inferior quality, vid Antigua, had been sold, but the price was not allowed to transpire. The supply of sugar was not large, but ordinary qualities wrere quite sufficient for the demand; fair was scarce, 26s. to 32s. had been realized. No tongues at market. Exchanges on London were quoted. as under:Jamaica and Colonial Banks.-90 days, 1 per cent. pm.; 60 days, 1I per cent. pm.; 30 days, 2 per cent. pm. Merchants' Bills.-90 days, par. On New York.-60 days, 1J per cent. pm. merchants' bills. The annual session of the Barbadoes Colonial Parliament came to a close on the 20th of August. The annual elections of representatives for the island were to take place on the 15th of September. Captain Dodgin, Inspector-General of Police, had left for Europe for six months' leave of absence, on account of impaired health; and his Ex^eUency the Governor had appointed Major Bellairs, of the 49thRegiinent, to act during his absence. The weather had been hot, with abundance of rain, thunder, and lightning. One or two vessels in Carlisle-bay were taking in the fag-end of the old cane crop. The young canes, and also the provision crop, were very promising. The American breadstuff market was rather stiff, supplies of al kinds being wanting, but there had been a few timely arrivals before the mails left. The health ofthe island continued good. At Grenada a meeting of the Executive Council had been held for the special purpose of deliberating upon a despatch of his Excellency Governor Hineks, bearing reference to the immigration question. A Royal order in Council, dated the 16th of July, makes known Her MIajesty's pleasure to leave to their operation the amended Road Act and the Tax Act, passed on the 23d of March last by the local Legislature, which the inhabitants had so largely petitioned against. There had been a great deal of rain during ithe fortnight. The last shipment of sugar for the year had been made in the Alfred for London, which enabled the crop to be summed up to within a few packages remaining unreported at the Treasury. The Customs accounts show the exports at 5,174 hhds., 771 tierces, 3,058k barrels, and 817 bags sugar; equal to 6,O83hhds. of 16cwt., being an increase of 1,013 hhds, compared with the total exportation reported In the Government blue-book for last year. In molasses the differencewas only104gallons infavour of this year. Of cocoa 5,539 bags were given as the quantity shipped to date; equal to 909,0201b., and being 116,0321b. in excess of the quantity shown in the official accounts for 1856; and there will be further shipments of cocoa this year so soon as the new crop begins. A large quantity of nutmegs and other valuable spices, the growth and produce of the island, has been exported. On the whole, the crops of the colony this year have resulted most satisfactorily in all respects. The Couirt of Policy at Demerara had had two sittings since the last mail, but nothing particular was tranzacted. The prison hulk nearly foundered during a stiff breeze, and the prisoners had a narrow escape of going to the bottom; she has since been abandoned, the civil engineer reporting her to be extremely leaky, and her bottom planking so rotten as not to bear caulking, and sbe is to be broken up. Trade continued dull among the merchants. Produce came in slowly, but freights were less scarce than they were a snort time back. The Royal Gazette of the 8th has the following items respecting the recent gold discoveries:- " A commission, consisting of the Hon. Dr. Blair, Sir W. H. Holmes, Mr. W. H. Campbell, and Mzr. 'Clintock, have proceeded oa a tour of exploration through the in. terfor, with the view of reaching the gold mines on the river Yuruari. The three first-named gentlemen started from George Town in the revenue schooner Pheasant, and proceeded to the river Waini, up which they ascended to the place of rendezvous, where they met Mr. M'Clintock and a strong party of Indian guides. Some Indians who came to George Town on Friday last brought intelligence that the party intended to start on the following day on their journey up the riyer. The commissioners purpose ascending the Waini until they come to the Barama, up which they wil proceed in their bateaux to its source. From that point they will strike across the country to the Cayuni, and then track up that stream to the confluence of the Yuruari. They will ascend the latter river until they come to Tupuquen, the site of the gold mines. They are expected to return in rabout six weeks. A gentleman arrived in the city last week from Venezuela, bringing with him about 15oz. of gold. He had visited the mines, and represents the gold to be abundant, and the mining operations as being carried on in the most primitive fashion." At Trinidad the weather was wet. 238 bags of cocoa were shipped by the Parana. The latest accounts from the French colony of Martinique state that the yellow fever had not disappeared among the shipping at St. Pierre. Agricultural and commercial prospects in Martinique were highly encouraging, and promised abundant crops or the ensuing year. Tlhe planters had been trying subsoil draining, and were quite pleased with the result. An ahown by the Customs' accountg, there had been shippeu, in the seven months ended July 31, 17,930,426 kilos., or 35,860 hhds. of sugar, 661,830 galons of rum, 123,4681b. of coffee, and 436,7851b. of cocoa. There was a decrease upon the exports of the same period last year, of 6,368 hhds. of sugar, and 67,576 gallons of rum, and an increase in coffee of 88,3591b., and in cocoa 108,9611b. We have papers fromPoint-h-Pitre to the 18th inst. Trade is represented as dull. The exports from the Ist of January to the 1st of August are stated as follows:-Sugar,15,358,330 kilos.,or 5,186,655 kilos. less than at corresponding period last year; ruan, 93,308 gallons, being 186,325 gaUons decrease on last year; coffee, 314,503 kilos., or 128,427 kilos. over last year. Intelligence from San Domingo to the 7th of September had been received at St. Thomas. General Santana had reached the army of the Provisional Government of Santiago and assumed its command. Two conferences, by means of flags of truce, had passed between the Provisional Army and that within the walls of the city, aud a cessation of arms for 24 hours had been determined on, in order to ascertain whether a pacific solution of the internal feuds could not be come to. The St. Thomas's5Tidende publishes a proclamation of President Buenaventura Baez, issued on the 22d of August, in which he states that the Consuls of the mediating Powers had officiaUy communicated to him the inteUigence that the insurgents had sent a deputation to Juana Mendez, soliciting the assistance of the Haytian Government, and that the Haytian forces were already on the frontier. This assertion, however, is said to be exaggerated, and not the substance of the communication made by the British and French Consuls at St. Domingo, who have in consequence protested against that portion of the proclamation. The same paper publishes a translation of the manifesto issued at Santiago by the Provisional Government established there, wherein the authority of Buenaventura Baez as the Executive of the Republic is solemnly denied, and the assertion that the executive power is reposed in the hands of the said Provisional Government. One other item in the St. Thomesa' Tidcnde will be interesting to English readers. Holland is, it seems, at last resolved to follow the example of her neighbours in abolishing slavery in her West Indian colonies. An official publication of the home Government prepares the inhabitants for the emancipation of slaves in Curawoa, Bonaire, Aruba, St. Eustatius, and Saba, and sets forth all the condi. tions attending so desirable a measure. There had been no late arrivals at St. Thomas's. Very little business was doing, and goods were much wanted. The public health was good. From Mexico there is no news of importance. Troubles were again looked for, many conspiracies being on foot against the Government of Comonfort, raostly stirred up by the priests. SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE. Her Majesty's ship Tartar was at Greytown, and the Brunswick at Colon. Her Majesty's ship Brilliant, which had been lying at Grenada for several weeks, was ordered to the northward on account of having yellow fever on board, and was to sai for Bermuda on the 12th of September. No less than 22 of her crew had died, and as many moro continued sick. The Grcnada Chronidc says," We find it difficult, indeed, to account for this fearful armount of disease and death, confined as they have been to one particular point, and that a proverbially salubrious situation. Some ascribe the vlsitation to the natural un. preparedness of the constitutions of the fine young Euro. peans of whom the crew was almost entirely composed, this being their very first sally into a tropical climate; others, to the erroneous step of selecting the Brilliant-so ill adapted from her lowness atween decks and other pecu. liarities of conformation-for destination to the West Indies, wlth a crew perfectly untried before In hot climates. Whatever may have been the cause, nothing is more certain than that to the ship alone must it be referred for ' a local habitation and a name.' Other vessels have lain beside the Brilliant in the careenage,and but one death has occurred among their people; while on shore the healthy character of tho island gas been all along fully sustained. In justice to Captain Paynter and the officers under him, we must not allow to pas unmentioned the unremitting solicitude they have all along manifested for the welfare of the suffering crew. The spacious buildings of the late Ordnance establishment below Fort George, as weU as the celebrated hos. pital on Rlchmond-hill, have been obtained, with additional asIstance from the experience of Dr. Aquart, of this place. for the better accommodation ond treatment of the affected seamen; and if success has not been the result in every instance It certainly is not owing to want of care or attention. As the ship is to sail on Saturday it is probable that four or five of the remaining sick will be left under ;reatment In the colony hospital. " l'he colonial steamer Tyne, from Demerara, bad foun. dered on the 30th of August. She was on her way to St. Thomas's to undergo repar, and when about 20 miles to the windward of St. Vincent she was struck by a heavy sea, during a squall, which broke her Into two parts. The captain and the crew with difficulty saved themselves In the boats, and got to St. Vincent. The steamer sank almost immediately after she wVs struck. "S-atlons of the Royal Mail Company's Steamships,The Clyde, at St. Thomas's; the Conway, for Jamaica; the Dee, for the Islands; the Dervwent, at Barbadoes; the Eagle, at Jamaica; the Solent, for Havauna;* the Thmeos, on, the Spanish Main; the lTrent, for the Spanish Main. The MIagdalena, with the mails of the 2d from Southanmp ton, bad not arrived out."
THE PACIFIC. By the arrival at Southampton of the West India steame Parana we have files of Panama papers to the 8th of September. From Chili the news is of very little interest. The new Ministry had not been named, and the Liberal party, both in Congress and through the press, demanded certain reforms, which the Government appeared unwilling to yield. The death of the son of the President and the illness of his wife had, to a certaln extent, restricted the political movements. A Bill had been presented to the Senate with a view to reward the services done to the State by Lord Dun. donaCd (as Lord Cochrane) during the War of Independence. It was proposed to give him the rank and pay of a Chilian Admiral. Speculation in flour had taken place at Valparaiso in consequence of advices received from Australia. There is nothing of importance from the Republic of Bolivia. Congress had assembled. The ravages of the fever had decreased, and the silver mines of Potosi were proving very remunerative. The news from the seat of war in Peru is most unsatisfactory; nothin,g had really been done either towards putting down the revolution or subverting the Government. President Castilla, with his forces outside Arequlpa, and General Vivanco, with his followers inside the walls, seemed so busily engaged watching each other that they had no ttme to fight. General Castillo was still the prisoner of President Castila in Callao. Mr. Sulivan, Her British Majesty's Chargc d'Affaires at Lima, died fromn the effects of the wound inflicted upon him on the 11th of August, as reported by last maiL The funeral took place on the 15th of that month; all public places were closed, the vessels in port fired minute guns, the flags were all lowered to half-mast, and a Government order prohibited all public amusements on the day of the funeraL No cluehad been obtained to the murderers, although a large rewvard had been offered for their discovery and apprehension. The Government had offered a reward of 10,000 dollars, and the British residents 50,000 more.
VOLUNTEERING AND RECRUITING. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-There appear to be solid military objections to the formation of separate volunteer corps, but might not the just and honourable desire of our English youth of the middle class to serve against those who have outraged and cruelly murdered their sisters and their sisters' ehildren in India be gratified by making some slight modifications of our existing army system, which are also imperatively called for on general grounds, and cannot under any circumstances be long delayed? These are :-First, to permit enlistment for three years, as during the latter part of the Russian war; and, Secondly, to give every third commission which becomes vacant to the best quialified and most distinguished non-commissioned officer or private serving with the regiment, provided one is forthcoming who is properly qualified. If these concessions were made, the only volunteering should be for the ranks of the regular army; and as the largest number of casualties is to be expected in the regiments in India, a prospect of promotion would be added to the motive derived from righteous indignation at atrocities greater than any which are known to have been perpetrated since the world began.

T}IE CAUSES OP THE INDIAN REVOLT. TO THE EDITOR OF TaE TIMES. Sir,-I belfeve there is no one here who will take upon himself to trace the particular causes of the present mutinies. The patent facts, which are very perplexing, are as much open to observers in England as in India. I think it very likely indeed that the Bengal Governmaent may, by the seizure of papers and other means, have gained possession of the real clue; but, on this side of India, we can only judge by studying the facts of each succesive outbreak in the light which we may have gathered from our knowledge of the native character. I do not think, however, that there can be any reasonable doubt but that the numerous deposed Rajas and Nawabs and humiliated nobles of the country, whom with perhaps impolitic benevolence we have allowed to retain the appearance of dignity and power and the reality of large allowances and numerous raffianly retainers, have always had an eye on their possible restoration. The China war seemed the proper opportunity. India was htripped of European troops, and 1 suppose they then began to make arrangements in earnest. The absolute necersii y for preparation for tampering with troops and ascertaining the cbances of succesa sufficiently accounts for the fact that the movement was delayed till we had settled matters with the Persians. Now, asuming this hypothesis, one can understand that in the first place the conspirators would try to make the army revolt me rely, and not excite a general rising of the people, which would have taken a longer time to concert; and, secondly, that itwouldbemost successful with the Mahomedans and high-caste Brahxnins and Kshutrya Sepoys of the Bengal army. As regards this latter point there has been ample discusion in the newspapem The Bengal army was, in fact, always ready to revolt. The officers were afraid of their men, and not a, single order could be issued without its being first ascertained through the native officers whether the rank and file would obey it or no. The Government were quite as timid as the officers themselves, and it is no wonder that the petted Prmtorians get the empire up for sale. That the Moslem iconoclast and vaccicide, on the one hand, and the Brahmin idolater and cow worshipper on the other, joined to murder their officers to deffle and mutilate English women, sbows that the movement could not, as far as they were concerned, be v religious one in its origin; but still it had no doubt its religious aspect, especially among the Mahomedans. The cry of "Deen, deen" was occasionally heard as well as the political war-cry of the Delhg Rai. Indeed, the natives may have some uneasiness when they see that the effect of European education is to crumble up their religious traditional notions. Instructed natives in only the rarest instances preserve their faith, and the recent extension of Government schools may well have appeared to a fanatical population an attempt on the part of the State to press on the proos of undermining the native religions. Thue, the political intriguers, whoever they were, who set the mutiny a-going, had a lever which they were acute enough to use with effect. The ignorant Sepoys were industriously plied by emissaries of their own faith, who no doubt poured out most monstroua fictions about the proselytizing intentions of Government. A lac of men wew to come from England to convert them all. Lord Canning had sent for them, and but for their discomfiture by the Imaum of Constantinople they would have been here ere this. Cartridges smeared with the abominable thing were prepred in order to accomplish the same end by guile. Well, conceive these meanJ employed for some months. Accident would determine where they should first succeed. This or that native festival would be appointed for the outbreak. No doubt there were many disappointments. The fire ws smouldering, but some time must elapse before the soldiers would dare to rise against the awful Sircar. At length, at Meerut a blundering imbecile (Hewitt) tempted them till they could resist no longer. All the rest is a matter of course. Delhi, of necessity, became the focus of revolt; and when a Delhi king was on the throne, thousands of men who up to that time had remained stanch conceived themselves bound by a new allegiance which overrode their obligations to the British Government. That aU these successive outbreaks were accompanied with great atrocities was to be expected. An ignorant inflaimnable soldiery became a mob. They would slay every European that there might be no witnessesagainst them when the day of retribution came. They ravished women and killed their children before their eyes, as many a besieging army in Europe has done at the sack of a city. The rabble of the city would of course imitate and exaggerate these outrages. It is indeed singular that the troops in Bahar should have deferred their rising till the end of July. It is to be explained, however, by the childish ignorance of the men, and the repeated persuaaions of the rebel emisaries. One important point, however, [ have not seen mentioned. How is it that all this was not found out before ? Wha is to blame I The explanation is partly, no doubt, that natives, under all circumstances, keep a veil spread between them and us. They do not invite and do not tolerate domestic intimacy with us. But, moreover, everyone that has to do with the administration of justice in India knows how enormously difficult it is to get information about any crime perpetrated or contemplated. Apathy, timidity, and hatred of the Government (it matters not what Government it may be) restrain the natives (it was exactly the same case in Ireland) from giving evidence against each other; and when the crime, as in the present case, was merely a conspiracy to turn out a Government, alien in "race, in manners, and religion," they had extraordinary motives for adhering to their usual reticence. I therefore cannot blame the authorities for not finding the rebeUion out. Every native was a traitor, and we had no go-betweens who could successfully play the part of spies. Certainly, if it had not been for Bengal notions, we might have crushed half the mutinies (e. g. Meerut, Dinapore, &c.) before this. I am not sure, however, on the whole that it is toberegrettedthat wehave let the wholeof the Bengal army show its rottenness. We have now to reconquer the country, and when that is done I hope we shall have learnt to rule with greater sternness, and give up the coaxing, fondling system which the natives see through and despise heartily. I believe they like, at all events they respect, a firm man. Disinterested benevolence they cannot understand, gratitude they onlydimlyappreciate asavirtue. Active patriotism, public spirit, as distinct froim puffing themselves in the newspapers, they do not yet comprehend. Municipal self-government they look upon as a mere bore; education as an odious and suspicioUS institution, which is necessary, hovFever, as a qualification for a place of 10 rupees a- month. If Government puts down (say) hookswinging they submit without a word, and no one grumbles except the Brahmins, who used to get the money and offerings of the devotee ; but if a missionary preaches against hook-swinging they resent it as an insult: in fact they only understand power in their rulers. ? hope that our policy henceforward will be intelligible to them, and cease to deal in refinements calculated for other meridians. Ve have made " native prejudices" a sort of standing obstruction to every improvement. For the future, I hope andl trust this miserable-timed policy will be revised, and I predict confidently that, as soon as "native prejudices" against everything that is useful cease to be cherished by us, they will cease to exist. It is said, truly, that a Brahmin will do anything for money. I don't see why we should exert ourselves to keep up the tariff. Y.- I-n ANGLO-LDDIAN. Poona, Aug. 30.

Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent and suite will proceed from Edinburgh to York to-day (Friday), aud from York to Windsor by Fpecial train to-morrow. Her Royal Highness will leave York at 9.65 a m., and reach Knottingley at 10 40 * Doncaster at iLS- Newrark at 12; Peterborough at 1.20 (where> her Royal hlighness wvill remain about an hour, and lunch); Hitohin at 2.40; ICing's.croas, 3.30; liow Junction at 3.51; and Windsor at 4.24. FIBE.-Yesterday morming, about 3 o'clock, a fire happened in the premises belonging to Messrs. T. Blackburn and Sons, mat and bag dealers, One Swan-yard, Bishopsgate-street without. At the time of the outbreak a number of horses and poultry were in the contiguous buildings. Warren, the conductor of the Royal Sofety's fire escape, upon being called broke open three doors and succeeded in saving four valuable horses and 60 fowls. The engines of the parish and four of the London Brigade attended, and a good supply of water having beon prooured the firemen went to work, but they were unable to get the flames extinguished until the warehouses and all tbey coontained were destroyed.

Conaols for money opened at the closing price of last evening90s to i, and advanced to 90, to g, at which, after some minor fluctuations, they left off with a steady appearance. For the 14th inst. they were quoted 90N to i, and for the new account on the 10th of November the final transactions were at 901 to s. The additional details from Calcutta increased the impression vwith regard to the approaching faU of Delhi, while the apprehensions respecting Lucknow have been slightly mitigated by the confirmation of the ,tatement that the garrison had succeeded during a sortie in obtaining a aupply of provisions, and that General Outram had proceeded to their relief with a force by steamers up the river Gogra. From Agra likewise the accounts are as satisfactory as could have been hoped, and in the commercial business of Calcutta there seems to bave been sonie revival of activity. U'nder these circumstances the market appeared stronger than for several days past, and the improved feeling would terhaps have been more clearly manifested but for the fact that the recent arrivals of Australian gold have all been sent to the Continent, and that some small withdrawals are now taking place from the Bank. India Stock was heavy at 208 to 210. India Bonds closed at 25s. to 17s. discount; and Exchequer-bills remain at 9s. to fis. discount, no purchases on Government account having yet been made. The foreign stock-market continues to be fairly supported by purchases for investment, but speculative transactions are limited.

Sc. for the present account, shoving an advance of an eighth. About 12,0001. of gold was taken from the Bank tc-day for exportation. The Parana, West India mail steamer, has brought specie to the amount of 343,4311., of which 239,281. Is in silver and 104,1461. in gold. The Atrato, to sail to-morrow, will take out 3,6701., mostly in gold. A trial for a Bank fraud yersterday at Stirling resulted in a verdict -which promises to form a very useful example. Mr. Salmon, the manager of the Falkirk branch of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, was recently discovered to have misappropriated between 25,0001. and 30,0001. of the sums entrusted to him. He was a justice of the peace, an elder of the church, an ex-provost of the town, and a prominent political leader. When he found that his delinquency had become known he ab. sconded, and haniged himself in the stable of a publichouse. The course of legal justice was therefore in his case ended. But there had been two clerks in the establishment named Reid and Gentles, wbo had been fully cognizant of his proceedings, as they had abetted him in falsifying the books, although they do not appear to have participated in the slightest degree in the plunder. These men the ibank were advised to prosecuite criminally, and the jury by a majority of nine to six has just pronounced them guilty. The considerations that as very young men they were greatly under the influence of a personage enjoying the local position of Mr. Salmon, that they had hitherto conducted themselves respectably, and that they had not persoiially had a single farthing of the money, 'were at the same time allowed due weight, and they were recommended in the strongest possible manner to the leniency of the Court. ELord Hlandyside, the judge, concurred in this view within proper limits, and instead of transportation their sentence was 18 months' imprisonment in Perth Penitentiary. The wholesome lesson will accordingly go forth that all persons who wilfully assist in concealing pecuniary malpractices, even though they may themselves take no share of the proceeds of the fraud, are liable to ignominious punishment. Generally, in such cases, the plea that the parties have derived no pecuniary or other benefit from the defalcations which have been tolerated excites a certain kind of false sympathy, as if they had been actuated by no bad motive, or, perhaps, even by a kindly and unselfish one. Nothing could be niore vicious than such a doctrine, and there will be no safety in the management of any public companies until it is put down. All who accept situations of trust have a clear duty before them. If they neglect that duty it must be for some motive of personal gratification. Many who are indifferent about money will break a trust Eolely that they may feed their vanity. Thus, occasionally, in Boards of Directionhumble men will wink at misdeeds by which they ostensibly gain nothing, merely to curry favour with more presuming spirits. Some again, from a grasping conceit or a desire to have a field for favouritism, will accept positions of responsibility to watch over the property of others which they never intend in the E]ightest degree to f.ilfil or for which they may be utterly incapable. They take the reward and cheat their clients of the service-an unstigmatized sort of larceny of which two or three notable instances have lately been furnished. Others will assist a personal acquaintance to help himself to the funds of strangers just as they would let a favourite dog commit depredation on the premises of their neighbours. Some are corrupted by social amnenlities and a dazzling patronage. But for Euch people the tribe of which Colonel Waiugh and Mr. Salmon are apparently specimens would enjoy a very limited career. Yet, although the motive in each of these cases is as selfish and des?icable as if it had sprung simply from the acquisitive propensity, society has hitherto taken little account v)f them. Let it be understood that every breach of duty written or implied is primarily alile disgraceful and involves liability, whatever may be the subEequent pleas in mitigation of punishment, and such exposures as have defaced the commercial records of the civilized world during the past fotur or five years will gradually cease. Tho public have the matter in their owni hands, arnd the case n' r reported from Stirling gives thrm an important precedent in the right direction. The following has been received in explanation of the position of the branch of the Agra and United Service Bank at Agra :- "Sir,-Adverting to an extract from the Bengal Hurkaru of the 23d of August, in the second edition of 2e 1imes of today, in which itis stated that 'the books of the AgraBank'are supposed to be destroyed,' but that I a duplicate of all the ao. counts is kept in Calcutta,' allow me, through your columns, tostate that the books of the Agra branch of this bank, with the cash (a small amount) and all the securities, were safely deposited in the fort there previous to the outbreak, so that there is no Ukelihood of the bank being obliged to make use of the dupUcates, which, however, the agent had, with much forethought, repared and forwarded to Bombay. "Though the bank was instituted at Agra'about 25 years ago, and continues to bear that name, the operations there alre now very limited, it having been merely a branch since 1853. when the head office was removed. " We have advices from Agra by this maU up to the 13th of August, stating that thebfortwas amply provisioned and capable of succesSfully resisting any force likely to be brought against it; but even were it otherwise the loss to this bank in any case could only be very inconsiderable. " i think it desirable to make this statement as the extract above quoted may tend to create unnecessary appre. Jhension8 among the numerous constituents of The bank. 1 am, Sir, your obedient servanit FRANCIS B. NEIISON, GeneralManager. "Agra and Ujnited Service Bank, Greshara-house, Ooto- ber. 1." The Baste'v Counties Herald states that the liabilities of the bank of Messrs. Harrison, Watson and Co., which suspended on the 24th ult., amount to about 400,0001., and that the assets are estimated at 225,0001. The joint sum owing fromMessrs. Taylor and Bright, and MIr. Hassell, chairman of the Cotton Mills Company, verges on a quarter of a million. Among the sulfferers by the failure are the various benefit societies at Hull who had opened depositaccounts at the bank. It is believed that sufficient to pay a dividend of lOs. in the pound will be realized. The Committee of Mexican bondholders report as follows:- " The Committee have received advices from Mr. Whitehead, dated 19th August and 3d ult. The paket brings $1,995 19c., which bad been taken from the chest of the dividend fund at Guaymas, and which Mr. Whitehead had recovered from the Government, but nio other remittance. The agents in Vera Crum, however, report that the duty bills there are being made out, and they expect they will shortly be handed over to them. In Collica $9,889. l8e., and in Manzanillo SM30 63c. had been collected by the agents of the bondholders. The country was qtiet." The annexed account of the Manohester markets during the past month is from Messrs. Robert Barbour and B:other - "A further advance in values has been eatablished here during the past mont. Notwithstanding the high prioes current, buyerm have given out their orders freely and a large amount of business has been done. Yarns have been in good demand, and manufactured goods have also attracted attention from their comparative cheapness. Spinners are doing a much more satisfactory business than manufaoturers, the former being well engaged at good prices, while the latter in many cases find it impossible to get remunerating rates, and are consequently Slowing their looms to remain idle. Though there is comparatively little doing for India, the demand for foreign markets generally, togetber with an active home trade, keeps stocks low and sellers independent. The advance in prices since the months of May and June now amounts to about 15 to 20 per cent. During the last few days there has been less doing, but though prices in some cases are sligbtly lower there are no symptoms of any general decline. " The advance in cotton from the commencement of the month up to the 18th inst. was id. to Ad. per lb., b" ' since then it bas receded Id. to id. The annu stateme, made up to the 1st of September shows the total receipt a; the Amuerican ports to be 2,940,000 bales this year, compared with 3,s30,000 last year. The total export to Great Britain has been 1,428,000 against 1,921,000 last year. The result is that there is now only stock in Liverpool of all kinds of 299,000 bales against 641,000 bales at same date in 1856, and .529,0(0 hales in 1853, and prices are 22d. per lb. higher than they were a year ago. Though spinners and manufacturers are supposed to hold considerably larger stocks than usual, there are many parties who expect a further advance before the close of the year."

SAIL WAY iffTBLLIGENCE. RpT21-TThTVf' The balf-yearly sneeting of this company was held at Bridport on Wednesday. The chairman of the board of directors, Mr. Gondry presided. TXhe report of the directors and the engineer's report, abstractsj of which have appeared in T'he Times, were taken as read. The statement of accounts showed that the total receipts iup to the 9th of September had been 83,8531., and the disbursements 80, 0981., leaving a balance of 3,7551. I he CHIAUINIAN, in moving the adoption of the report, conigratulated the shareholders on the Batisfactory progress that had been made since their last nmeeting. On MondLay last a trial engine lent by the Great Western Company ran the whole distance, for- the first time, from the junction at Maiden Newton to the terminus at Bridport. The line wais in excellent condition, and there was noo doubt they would receive the necessary, certificate from the Government Inspector. The notice that the works were ready for his inspection had been given on that day, so that there was every reason to believe that, unless something unforeseen occurred, they wouldl be able to open the line on Saturday, the 10th Inst. The arrears of call alluded to in the repr. as amounting to 3781. had been reduced to 3331. eTh~e whole of the capital would be required, and at the last meeting he had told them that there were something like 202 shares unapproupriated ;however, since then 12 had been subscribed for, upo the condition that the remainder should be taken up. Of the 80 left, the directors had agreed to take 28 if the shareholders would take the other 52 amoing them. Mr. SaroITH secondled the miotion for adopting the report, which was carried unanimously. In accordance with the suggestion of the chakirman, a paper was sent round the room, and 28 of the 52 shar-es were immediately subscribed for. Two of the proprietors stated that th ey would endeavour to get the remainder taken up, and the meeting separated. -WEXFORD) AX]D BAGNALSTOWN.

The hall-yearly meeting of this railway corapany was appointed to be held on Wednesday at Glasgow, hut in conce(juence of the non-attendance o~f a sufficient number oZ shareholders to constitute a meeting no business was trans. acted. The -report of the directors stated that the traffic on the line continued to increase ; the gross reveniue for the half -year ending 31at July exceeded by 1,5001. that of the corresponding period of 1856, and by I ,0001. that for the half-year ending 31st of January last. These imrvemnents had arisen chiefly from the facilities gvnto traders by the company's additional waggons. Wihthe exception of 4,000 square yards of plotlN~o. 2, no further sales of land had been made during the past half-year. Having still. so much unsold land the directors, notwithstanding the favourable state of the revenue, did not feel themnselves warranted in recommending any inicrease of dividend. The dlrectors, therefore, p reposed a dividend at the rate of 2A per cent, per annunm free of Income-tax, payable on the 9th of October, TRAFFIC RETURNS. Mlles Paes- Mdes- Total, Total Railway.

RAILWAY AND MINING SHARES. Thursday 3Evening. In railway shares a general advance has taken place in all the speculative descriptions, and the -narket closed with considerable firmness. Midland were especially in demand, and improved 21., a report beiDg current that an attempt is in progress to arrange the differences between the Midland, the GreatNorthern, and the London and North-Western companies. South Devon alone receded. East (ndian were without alteration; some of the smaller sorts, however, show more weakness. There was a recovery of 11. in Grand Trunk of Canada; Great Western of Canada and Buffalo and Lake Huron also advanced. in French shares, Great Northern of France, Paris and Lyons, and Western and NorthWestern were a shade higher. In American, Illinois Ctntral and New York Central improved, and a reduction occurred in Michigan Central Bonds. The transactions in mines have been unimportant; Alfred Consols again receded, and St. John del Rey closed 11. higher. There was no alteration in jointstock banks. In miscellaneous securities a decline took place in Canada Land. 5P nTNA WV RTAT A D m - oT

MILITARY AVD NAVAL INTELLGENCE. Major-General the Earlof Cardtgan has arrived in Dablin for tho purposo of inspecting the 8th Hussars and the 17th Lancers, previous to embarcation for India. A letter from Malta. dated September 25, says:- " It is satisfactory to find that the Government at home have at length detormined to despatch troops across the Isthmus of Suez. Orders have booen received by the Lieu. tenant-General Commanding to place two companies of the 37th Regiment in readiness to embark by the next packet which conveys the outward India mail to Alexandria. The destination of this vanguard of British troons is stated to be Aden, and it is said that it will be followed soon afterwvards by the other companies of the regiment." The 4th company of Royal Engineers, under the command of Brevet-Major L. Nicholson, and the 11th company, comnmanded by Captain C. E. Cumberland, will leave headquarters, Brompton Barracks, Chatham, at an early hour this morning for Southampton, for the purpose of proceed. ing overland to India. An immense quantity of sapping and mining implements, intrenching tools, and other materials required by this branch of the servicoe, with photographic apparatus, batteries, &co., was forwarded yesterday and the previous day by the Royal Engineer train from the stores at Brompton to Southampton, to be shipped for India, to arrive with the Royal Engineers. The Sappers aud Mliners are also provided with a number of the newly invented portable indiarubber boats, for the purpose of transporting the officers and men across the rlvers of India, and the utmost eare has been paid by the authorities at the headqusrters(Chatham)toprovidethe officersandmen with every. thing they may require for narrying on the campaign in India. The 10th company, under the commaud of Captain A. A'Court Fisher, and the 21st, under that of Captain Glastonbury Neville,are both in readiness to embark at an hour's notice. Both these compaies will probably embark for India next week. The following are the officers of the staff proceeding to India :-Lieutnant-Colonel E. Drury Harness, in command; Captain F.

General Williams, Commandant of the Artillery at Wool. wich, yesterday morning visited the Royal Marine gun.drfll battery, commanded by Captain M'Arthur, Royal Marine Artillery. Captain M'Arthur, who was on duty at the battery, requested permission to put his men through a course of manceuvres, which the General consented to witness, and which occupied nearly an hour. Colonel Brown and the whole body of available officers belonging to the eorps were promptly in attendance. At the close of the pro. ceedings the General expressed his gratification to Colonel Brown, complimented Captain M'Arthur on the success which had attended his exertlons. Arrangements were yesterday entered into at the Artillery quarters, Woolwlch, for the reception of 400 men of the Oxford Militia, who are to arrive in the garrison to-day (Friday), to do duty until further orders. About 400 men of the 10th battalion Royal Artillery a,t Woolwich commenced passing medical examination preparatory to being despatched for service in India, and are expected to follow shortly after the departure of Captain Thring's and Captain Calvert's companies by the overland rioute vi Southampton and Alexandria.

It is expected that the regiment will not remain in Doncaster more thin a few days, but Colonel Loftus, the commanding officer, has not yet received any speelfic instructions as to their destination. The men esemed in excellent spirits.
CITY SBEWBRS. A Court was held, Deputy C ETsi presiding. VENTILA'o12f OF THE sEWERS, In answer to a question from Mr. ABRAhA, Mr. HAYWOOD, the engineer, said, he thought he should be able to report in about two months on the subject of the ventlation of the sewers. The matter was also referred to the Medical Officer of Health, with whom he was in comn inunication upon the subject, and when the requisite in. quiry was made he thought they would be both ready to report together. As far ss he had considered the mattei, he saw great difficulty in advising any system likely to be effective, and at the same time economical. Mr. Ross said, the question was one of very great importance, and ought to be taken up by the Metropolitan oarcd of Works The reports will, it is expected, be brought up at the next Court.

SoumAMPTox, Oct. 1.-The European and American Company's steamship Jason, Captain Britton, left this morning for New York, with upwards of 400 passengers (principally steerage), a ship-letter mafl, and large cargo. Tne Calcutta, Captain Blackmorer belonging to the same company, sailed hence yesterday evening for Cork, where she is to take in the 51st Regiment for conveyance to India. THE RELIEF OF LucxNow.-At the present stage of the terrible drama now being played out in India. the main Interest centres in General Havelock's force. Wil this General, who in a few weeks has won eight brilliant victories against overpowering numbers, be able to fight his way to Lucknow before the garrison there, hard beset and surrounded by hosts of furions zealots, succuLmbs to irresistible pressure? Or are new bands of hapless victims -brave men, delicate la2des, and helpless childrento glut the savage hate of men, or rather fiends, who have sworn to exterminate every European, every Christian in Hindostan ? There is not an inhabitant of this island whose heart has not thrilled responsively to theso u vestlons. Would that we could answer tbem satisfactorUy. Alas! so far from that, we have now rather to ask whether the column which we hoped would have relieved LucL-now wiU be able to make head at CawLpore, to which It has Xetreated, against the overpowering numbers of the enemy wrhich are assembling round it. Reduced to 1,003 efficient men, and with nothing that can be called a fort, its danger is zreat.But, supposing Havelock to hold his ground uDntU the 90th Regiment and the 5th FusUoersreach him on. say the lt of September, he would then perhaps be strong enough to force his way to Lucknow, and would do the disf ance of 53 miles in eight marches, allowing for the time lost in engagements with the enemy. Let us examine the route. The stages then to Lucknow are as follows:From Cawnpore to Onao, 10l miles, over a bad and heavy road, It being necessary first to cross the Ganges, which is spread out to a great width opposite Cawnpore. On aois a large village, and here on the 30th of July General Haveloolc engaged and defeated an immensely superior force. The next stage is Onao to Rahmstganj, UA miles, over a bad and much cut up road, passing the large vluage of Ramgani half way. Here, again, a second action was fought on the 31st of July, and the enemy routed. A bad road leads to the next stage, Noelganj, 12 miUes. The river Sye must be crossed half-way on this stage, where Havelock was stopped by its swollen stream, the opposite bhnk being {lined with the enemy. Had he sucoeeded in crossing he would stlU have had to travel 10 miles to Badli KA Talnyah, at the entrance oF the city of Lucknow, whenoe to cauatonments is nine miles through the narrow streets of the city, aoross the Ghoomtee river by a bridge, which might be destroyed, and thence over heavy sans. Supposing the march to be successfully accomplished in spite of the vast masses of the enemy which aro sa d to be postod along It, what will be General Havelook's next movement? From LuCknow he would probably return to Cawnpore, for, supposlng him to maroh next cn Agra by Mynpoorie, he would in any case have to retrace his steps towards Cawnpore as far as beahganj, 34A miles, and he would probably find dificulty in crossing the Ganges, except at Cawnpore, where he has already seoured the means. From Cawnpore to Mynpoorle the total distance is 107 miles. The road during the rains is heavy. At 47 miles from Cawpore the Eean a considerable stream, must be crossed. Itynpoorie Is a town Vith less than 3,000 Inhabitants. The Eesan must here be crosed apain. There was a bridge, but whether it still exiss is unknown. The distanoe from Mynpoorie to Agra is 71; miles over a good road in dry weather: but for the first 40 miles it Is during the rains and till November under water, varying in depth from one to three feet. From Agra to Delhi by Allyghur, now in the hands of the eremy, is 139 miles, but this is a very cirouitous route. There is a more direct route along the river Jumna, but It is scarcely practicable at this season for large bodies of troops. On the whole, it seems reasonable to expect that nnder the most favourable circum. stances a month or five weeks must elapse before General Havelo¢l;'s army, even if powerfully rcimforced, could, after quitting Luokow, unite writh that before Delhi; and ere that we trot the English fla ill wve over what remalns of that detested city. We may be sure that officers like Nicholson and Chamberlain will ur£e on the assault if there should be a shadow of probability shat it will succeed. Should It, however, be necessary to delay, that delay will only be the more fatal to the rebels, who will then be surrounded without a possibility of escaping. In either case their punishment is not far distant, and wll be, we doubt not, a sgnal one.-From the Hom7eward Mail from India. Chin&, and the Eaet, of Ootobeo 1, 15.7,
LOA2DON, FBIDAY, OCTOBEB 2, 187. The arrival of Indian letters and newspapers puts us in possession of opinions as well as facts. One naturally wishes to know what is thought and felt at one end of the wire, or other line of communication, while war rages or conspiracy threatens at the other. But, the bare facts once announced, there is not much to satisfy impatience in the speculations, the rumours, or the gossip even at the very seat of Government. Many a tourist has found that at Geneva or Berne he was to all practical purposes no nearer the Alps than in Whitehall or Cheapside; and it would seem as if people were no nearer Delhi and Lucknow at Bombay and Calcutta than we are at home. Their conjectures are little less *wild. They seem almost equally condemned to be idle bystanders when every feeling wotuld prompt the quickest and most vigorous interference. Anglo-Indian opinion, however, has evrdently entered a new stage, though one not without precedent. Some of the finer, more subtle, and more torturing questions that occupied it at first have now answered themselves. Of seventy regiments not one is now left to foster the fond illusion of its fidelity till the happy moment for the bullet or the " tulwar" to do its appointed work. Not a mess remains to be butchered sitting, or a colonel to be rudely interrupted while writing to the GOVERNOR-GENFRAL a letter full of happy assurances. Few stations remain to be burnt, and few treasuries to be " looted." The death of many hundred officers, civil and military, in battle, or more generally by the hand of the assassin, and the massacre of as many women and children, have gone far to exhaust the fund of private solicitudes. It is true that there are stations dotted about of wbich little is known; I but the mind wearies of repetition. Lucknow would be only Cawnpore on a somewhat larger scale, and should the infection which has reached the Bombay and Madras armies infect the whole of the dark flock, and lead to equal atrocities, no numbers, no magnitude would make up for the want of novelty. So opinion has now passed into the hard, calculating, military stage. The residents at Calcutta can look forward to the approaching campaign. The real war, according to Indian notions, has not yet begun. It must begin in September, and end in May, after which month it seems taken for granted that not a shot will be fired. Passing, then, over the preliminary horrors, Indian politicians are evidently satisfied with the prospects of the war. They think that we shall have a succession of triumphs, and that next Spring wiU find us holding India with a stronger grasp than we ever did before. Strangely enough, this conviction betrays itself at the very time that the arrival of the English mail brings what seems there an immense underrating of the mutiny. We believe that on this point they are mistaken. The statements and estimates made, in or out of Parliament, to the best of our recollection, simply reflected from time to time the latest news from India. It was nobody's businems here to anticipate worse than was known, and reinforcements were despatched, if not quite as expeditiously as if the worst had been known, as expeditiously as anything is ever done in this country. The military estimate, then, taken at Calcutta looks rather to the reserve than to the forces engaged, and rather to the surrounding country than to the actual seat of war. Even the prospect of reverses in the present battlefield and the interruption of communications does not seem to concern them as much as might be supposed. At Calcutta they are safe. The arrival of the Chinese force, the sight of the Shannon in their river, the passage of several regiments up the river, and, above all, the departure of Captain PEEL with 400 British sailors and ten 68-pounders, make them feel as secnre as we do at home. The arrival of Sir COLIN CA3rPBELL, a Commander-in-Chief with real power, replacing Sir P. GRANT, who, as an Indian officer, had responsibility without power, contributed to this comfortable feeling. At all events, the tide of war seemed to be rolling up the Ganges, and every wave of it would drive further inwards, the mutineers of Dinapore, who have created Bo much alarm; of Ramghur, on the very borders of Bengal proper ; of Oude, and the whole vaUey of the Ganges. Looking to the other extremity of the disturbed line, the state of things at Delhi was so encouraging that we felt ourselves justified in calling it the other daythe bright spot in our Indian prospects; but at Calcutta they were even more sau,guilne, and fully expected on the 23d of August that the assault had already taken place, wheii it was supposed the mutineers would be dispersed and a large part of the besieging force would be available for the relief of LIucknow and the conquest of Oude. The tables had so far been turned on the mutineers that time was in our favour. Every week was adding severalthousands to our force, and the idea of a Sikh invasion of Hindodtan u nder the British flag was so popular in the Punjab, that there appeared to be no limits to the accession of strength from that quarter. In Delhi all was confusion, dissension, desertion., want of powder, percussion caps, money, mue, and food. The RiNG was moat uncomfortable in his quarters, our artillery having found His Majesty's range. The 3Iahomedans and Hindoos were quarTeUin, for the use of the water tanks. All were greatly discouraged by the uniform defeat of the recent sorties. In this extremity the question was whither to go-whether to consult discretion by going down the Delhi side of the Jumna, or to take the more valorous course of crossing the river by the bridge of boats, and making for Oude. In either ease it would be strange if we did not follow them up, and inflict that chastisement which they now avoid under the shelter of walls and streets. As far as can be inferred from the description of our camp before Delhi, and the bodies of Irregulars flocking to our aid from the Punjab, Cashmlere, Kumaon, and Nepaul, we are much better prepared for open warfare than the garrison of Delhi, with no other " tower of strength" than their " King's " name." The probability is that the more desperate and deeply committed of the mutineers, driven out of Delhi, would swarm in the direction of Oude. It is vain at this distance, and this day, to speculate on the fate of Lucknow, which, be it well or ill, is now a thing of the past. Even at Calcutta they had had no direct and certain news of the garrison, with its precious and helpless charge, for a whole month. It was supposed that General OUThA-M would attempt to relieve the place by going up the Gogra or the Goomtee, which might be a necessary change of route, but serves to show the time required for the task. But, whatever the result, there will then be aimply two armies in the field. Agra, at least, we assume to be safe, as it is no longer mentioned with anxiety, and is said not even to be invested. Certain points, such as Allahabad, wil then be held for military purposes; but otherwise it will be a simple, ordinary case of two armies in the field, depending for success on their spirit, their numbers, reinforcements, supplies, and the good-wiU of the population. We feel no question that in all these points, except, possibly, the numbers actuallybrought into action, we have the best of it. We have all the chief conditions of success. It will be found-indeed, it has already been found-that, as we have said from the first, this is not a rebellion, or even an insurrection, it is only a mutiny. Notwithstanding certain taunts at our want of prescience or want of capacity to comprehend the fact, this is only a military revolt, inspired by those causes and motives that prevail most with the military character-aggrandizement, love of plunder and general license, pure restlessness,-in a word, all those feelings that have rendered India a sea of troubles for these many centuries. The mischief isal.most confined to the soldiers, unless it be an accession of credit and strength to their cause that the criminals they release from the gaols and the ruffians of every town help them to plunder and destroy. But, on the whole, with rare and accountable exceptions, the people are in our favour, and as the war proceeds wiiU be so more and more. Every day the war will be confined to a still closer compass, and with Bengal, the sub-Himalayan countries, the Punjab, and Central India on our side, we shall crush the mutiny, we fully expect, before next Summer.
Two of the Tory leaders have favoured the world with remarks on the Indian question-Sir EDwARD BULWFzn LYTTON at St. Alban's, and Mr. DISRAELI at Newport Pagnell. Agricultural gatherings were the occasions of both speeches, and both were pronounced after the usual loyal and patriotic toasts which follow the annual auier. It is a proof how completely the crisis through which we are passing has engrossed all the faculties of the nation that each speaker hastened to leave the pleasant subject of a good harvest and increasing prosperity for the doleful tale of treachery and disaster. Sir EDWARD seems, indeed, to lhave been animated by the associations which surrounded him. The Earl of VEEVLAII was in the chair, and the speaker tells Us that he was instautly reminded of BACON, who also bore the title of VEYUL.AI. Moreover, if the philosopher could come on earth again and see the improvement on the Verulam estates, " the sight nught suggest to him one other illustra" tion for his admirable work on The Adranre. " ment of Leamkintg." Influenced by these high recoUections, Sir E. Lyrox could not descend to make a party speech, but only hinted something about " the policy which has produced the revolt " in India," and the necessity for Parliament to examine into the causes which have produced suchI a wide-spread explosion. But Mr. DISRAELI has no such scruples. He and his friends were unable to meet at dinner after the ploughing matches and the cattle-show without attempting to make capital out of the calamity which is now chiling aU hearts. Mr. DAU-NCY, who, we learn, is strict, rigidly strict, in preventing any admixture of party politics in these agricultural assemblages, " takes upon "himself to propose ' the Health of the County "' Members,' and to eulogize the foresight and "sagacity of Mr. DISRA-ELI in regard to the iIndian Mutiny, and also to animadvert on the "levity of Miniaters quitting their posts to "indulge in autumnal sports at so critical a "conjuncture." This was the keynote of Mr. DIsiRxaL's performance; and we wil venture to say that an address showing less consideration for the circumstances in which the country is placed has not been delivered for a long time. It will be plain to every one that the language held at this moment by political men in England will be repeated in every corner of the earth. The eyes of the whole world are upon us, the ears of all men are open to catch any sotnds which would tell of dejection and discouragement. And it is not alone the European reputation of the country which is at stake. It is not lest the Uinivers and its brethren should exult and prophesy that we should be cautious, but lest Asiatics of any race and region should receive encouragement to rise against us, or persuade others to rise. If ever there was a time when it was necessary to impress the world with a consciousness of our power and of the certain defeat and punishment of the rebels, It is at present. We all know, indeed, that the affair is a mere question of tune. As surely as civilization is superior to barbarism, the Englishman to the Musaulman and Hindoo, so surely in a few months-perhaps weeks-will the miscreants of Upper India bh crushed and scattered. No efforts which fanaticism and despair can prompt will be able to avert their fate. But in the meantime the tide of mutiny may ebl or flow in a manner which we can neither foresee nor control. Though eventual triumph is certain, yet the fate of hundreds of women and children, not to speak of brave men, depends upon the impulses of a barbarous soldiery. These impulses will be determined, we can safely say, by hope and fear. If these ignorant and savage men believe that the hand of England is weak, nay, if they think that it wiU be long in desoending, they wiiU continue their career of devastation, trusting to a speedy triumph or, at least, an eventual escape, each with his share of booty. But if they become convinced that the hour of retribution is at hand, that to cope with England is beyond the power of themnselves or their gods, they will fall asunder like sand ; the lives of thousands of our countrymnen will be saved, and Btitish authority restored speedily and completely. Now, what news is likely to be trausmitted to these vast populations at the present hour ? By routes which the European never treads, and from mouths which they know will not deceive them, they are probably already hearing of the vengeance which is to come. If Persia could intrigue with Oude, and Hindoo Sepoys communicate treason through 1,000 miles of country, can we doubt that the rebels have even now learnt that more than 50,000 Englishmen are on the way to punish their atrocities ? Are they to be delivered i from this wholesome dread, which may at any moment disperse them and leave us conquerors without a blow? Is the Turkish or Syrian Mussulman to be able to send the nevws that in England the greatest men are afraid that the whole of India is about to revolt, and that if it revolts the English will be powerlezs ? And if wantonly spreading such alarms be reprehensible, what are we to think of Mr. DIsnAmELI's address ? In order to respond to a foolish speech about his own foresight and the Alinister's " levity," he thinks proDer not only to paint actual facts in the darkest colours, but to predict disaster and ruin without the slightest foiudation. "We were told," he says, " that "the armies of Bombay and Madras could be | entirely depended upon. Week after week, "howvever, we have found that these hopes have " been fallacious." Here, indeed, is a manifest departure from the truth, for the fact of the Bombay and Madras armies having as yet, in a most wonderful manner, resisted the temptation to revolt is undoubted. " But," continues MIr. DISRAELI, " greater disasters may I "occur. We shaU probably hear that the I"lahratta Princes have risen against us. We " must prepare ourselves for an insurrection in "the Punjab-a province which we are always told " has been faithful." The next topic is mercy for the muttineers. Because a feeling of indignation has been roused by the violation and slaughter of our counitrywomen, MTr. DISRAELI would almost suppose that " the religious feelings of Englishmen " have undergone some sudden change, and that " instead of bowing before JEsuTS we are prepar" ing to revive the worship of MoLocH," and he hopes that the clergy will take advantage of the Fast-day to bring us into a better state of mind. But we need quote no more of this ill-judged effusion, which only shows how the subjection of all a man's faculties to party spirit prevents him from rising to the level of patriotic feeling. The speech of 3Ir. DIS1AELI is an attempt to turn the present trials of the country into a means of attacking the Alinistry. The party which has opposed all i eforms at home may endeavour to prove that the Government has raised a rebellion by its reforms in the East, and that, in fact, there are persons in ffice " responsible for the revolt in India; " ths ane party may attempt to injure its opponents by (xaggerating every danger and carping at every i ernc Ay during the progress of the troubles; but we feel certain th-at the comnmunity will see through end condemn any such affected patriotism. Such events as those we now behold %re too momentous to be made the subject of any party strife.
Our readers have just had a second opportunity of considering the principles which, in the opinion of our correspondent " P.,"and a very large class of Indian functionaries whom he may be considered to represent, should characterize the future policy of our Indian administration in matters of religion, From this opinion we are constrained to express our owvn entire dissert, and we conceive, indeed, that the principles referred to now stand convicted by the results of experience no less than the dictates of reason. There is one argument wvhich may be removed from the controversy at once and altogether. No party in this country either desires or has ever desired to make the power of the Dritish Government in India an instrument of religious conversion by persecution or terror. No modification of such agencies would ever be adopted or reconimended by any responsible sect of politicians or Christians. Such a policy, in fact, would be utterly inconsistent not only with the spirit of our creed, but ivith our nattural disposition and national practices. In what part of the world have British missionaries or British officers ever attempted compulsory proselytism ? And why should we seek to exert in India a species of violence which we have never employed elsewhere ? NVhen our correspondent speaks, therefore, of " decided hos" tility" to native religions, and of " war to the " knife against caste, and creed, and Islam; " and when he warns us against the acceptance of aly such policy, he is arguing with a visionary antagonist, and deprecating courses which are never likely to be embraced. The idea of anything even resembling persecution on the part of the Indian Government may be promptly dismissed as one which will never be entertained. The true questlon at issue lies, not between a policy of forcible propagation and a policy of charitable tolerance, but between alternatives oZ a very different kind. Up to this timie our Indian administration has been distinguished in matters of this description by a principle more positive than that of neutrality, and which, as far as its activity extended, operated rather to the disparagement than the elevation of the religion which we professed. We not only abstained from all authoritaUive intervention with the native forms of worship-a course of obvious prudence and propriety-but we allowed our toleration in this respect to assume an aspect of encouragement, at the same time that we submitted to a virtual suppression of our own creed and its obligations. We gave the actual support and countenance of our Government to idolatrous ceremonies and institutions; we permitted rites of the foulest impiety and barbarism to be practised when, as rulers of the country, we could have interdicted them ; we allowved the profession of Christianity to remain absolutely penal by Hindloo law ; and we (onducted ourselves generally as if we held our power by sufferance, and were content to sink our character as Christians on condition of an easy tenurc. This in reality is the " traditionary policy" to which our correspondent alludes. That it was not becoming to us, either as Christians or governors, we need hardly stop to prove. That it has not preserved us from the worst outbreaks of fanaticism we are now but too plainly taught. Our correspondent does not shut his eyes to the facts before him; but, after assuming thas the Bengal army has revoltcd on the declared ground of alarm for caste and creed, proceeds to argue frmim this very assumption in favour of unlimitea deference to prejudicez so sacredly oherished. We draw a different moral from the lesson. We tbinlk the one great fact protruding itself through all these horrors is that a century of " traditionary "policy" has not sufficed to preserve us from those very disasters against which it was designed to guard. For a hundred years togethEr we have been k-eeping our- Christian quality out of sight, and venturing only in the most timid and cautious manner to relieve the natives of India from one or two el the most terrible obligations which their misbelief imposed. We have forbidden infanticide and suttee, though even in these extreme cases oiur r%oceedings have somuetitnes been confined to expostulation and remonstrance, where a more peremptory prohibition could easily have been issued, and must necessarily have been obeyed. Talking one step further, we have exempted young widows from tthe necessity of perpetuial celibacy, and have decreed that no native shallu be punished by the loss of h_s inheritance for professing the same religion as his rulers. This is the sum of our " intervention" since the year of grace 1757, and as the reward of our moderation we now see our countrymen massacred and our dominion repudiated in favour of a Government the very characteristic of which is proselytism by fire and sword. WVe think it must be clear to aU that if this is the end of our traditionary policy there can be nothing in that policy wvhich is worth preservation on the score of the security which it yields. To say that as Christians and lords paramount we ought to have done less is utterly impossible, though it would be easy enough to argue that we should have done much more. Even " P." himself would not maintain that we should have allowed widows to be burnt alive or little children to be murdered; in fact, his discontent seems to be concentrated on the new marriage law and the new law of inheritance. The former of these enactments, by which Hindoo women were relieved from a barbarous and demoralizing penalty, could obviously have been dictated by concern for the natives alone; and if by the latter we protected our own faith from persecution, is it possible to argue that we did too much ? Yet this dilemma is unavoidable-either we ought never to have ventured upon even these manifestations of our Christianity and otur power, or a policy perfectly unexceptionable has not saved us from sanguinary insurrection. It is plain that at the price we are now actually paying we might have pushed on the work of religious conversion as rudely as we pleased. If every Governor-General since the days of CIIvB had been a Duke of ALVA, we could not have been assailed with a more terrible eruption of treachery, ferocity, and fanaticism. We have been labouring to pacify an invisible but dreaded monster by obsequious conce3sions and studious deference, and we find on a sudden that in spite of our policy we are exposed to its most violent attacks. By assuming for the future a firmer attitude we may probably do better, and can certainly not do worse. We certainly cannot suffer,-we hope we may gain, by acknowledging in the face of the Eastern world that we value and reverence our own faith though we wiU compel no one to share it. The idolatry and prejudices of oar subjects may command our toleration, but they need not receive our respect. Above all, let it be known and felt that we hold India less by sufferance and more by strength. This very crisis will show how impotent is even the mightiest military insurrection against the power of England, and a littti more wisdom wou3d have saved us from the miseriez of the trial. The peril has been created, not by the presence of Christian missionaries, but the absence of Christian so) diers. If every province in India had been gardisoned ecnd governed like thePunjab, we might have viade a much more dignified avowal of our religion v ithout ever hearing of the Mutinies in Bengal.

I THE MASSACRE AT CAWNPORR N S NfUJOOR JEWARREES STORY. The writer of the following is deseribed as one of our spies. He belongs to the lat Native Infantry, and is said to be a moat intelligent man:- " When the mutiny broke out at Cawnpore he was with three companies of his regiment, the first, or GIlls Poltsn at Banda. On the breaking out of the Sepoys at Banda Nujoor Jewarree saved the life of a Mr. Duncan and his wife (Mr. Dnncan was a writer, and instracted this man In English), by concealing them in his hut, and afterwards reporting to the Rajah that they were willing to turn Mfug. sulmana. For this the Sepoy fell Into ill odour with his comrades, and when the mutineers marohed into Cawnpore theNena took away from him all he had-about 3S0rs.-and confined him with four more Sepoys in the same house with the Europeans. At the fight of Fattehpore he was released by the Nena, went back to the Gundee Nuddee, and thence came over to the English. His account of the Nena's treacherous attack on the boats and the escape and recapture of one of the boats is as follows:- " When the Nena's guns opened on the boat in which Wheeler Sahib, the General, was (it has now been fully ascertained from servants and others who were wlth the English party that General Wheeler was not dead before the massacre, but was put wounded on board the boats) he out its cable and dropped down the rlver. Some little way down the boat got stack near the shore. The infantry and guns came up and opened fire. The large gun they could not manage, not knowing how to work the elevating screw, and did not use it. With the small gan they fired grape tied up in bags, and the in[antry fired with their muskets. Thii went on all day. It did not hurt the Sahib log much. They returned the fie writh their rifles from the boat, and 'wounded several of the Sepoys on the bank, who therefore drew off towards evening. The Sepoys procured a very big boat, into which they all got, and dropped down the river upon the Sahib's boats. Then the Sahlbs fired again with their rifles and wounded more Sepoys in the boat, and they drew off and left them. At night came a great rush of water in the river, which floated off the Slhib's boat, and they passed on down the river, but owing to the storm and the dark night they only proceeded three or four koss. In the meantime inteUigence of the Sahib's defence had reached the Nrena, and he sent off that night three more companies of the native reglment (lst Oade Infantry) and surrounded the Sahib's boat, and so took them and brought them back to Cawnpore. Then came ont of that boat 60 Sahibs and 25 mem-Sahlbs and four children-one boy and three halfgrown girls. The Nena then ordered the mem-Sahibs to be separated from the Sahibs to be shot by the Gillis Pultun (lst Bengal Native Infantry); but they said, ' ea will not shoot Wheeler Sahib, who has made our Pultun's name great, and whose son is our quartermaster; neither will we kIll the Sahib log. Put them in prison.' Then said the Nadire Pultun, 'What word is this? Put them in prison; we will kill the male.' So the Sahib-log were seated on the ground, and two companies of the Nduire Pultun placed themselves over against them, with their muskets ready to fire. Then sid one of the mem-Sahibs,-the doctor's wife sho was, I don't know his name, bu' ho was either superintending-surgeon or meedical storekeeper-' I will not leave my husband; if he must die I will die with him.' So she ran and sat down behind her husband, clasping him round the waist. Directly she said this the other mem-Sahibs said, ' We will also die with our husbands ; and they aU went and sat down beside their husbands. Then their hnsbands said, ' Go back,' but they would uot. Whereupon the Nona ordered his soldiers, and they going in pulled them forcibly away, seizing them by the atm; but they could not puU away the Doctor's wife, who there remainod. Then, just as the Sepoys were going to fire, the padre (chaplain) called out to the Nena and reqaested leave to read prayers before they died. The Nena granted it. The padre's bonds were unloosed so far as to enable him to tako asmall book out of his pocket, from which he read; but all this time one of the Sahlb-logs, who was shot in the arm and the leg, keptcrying out to the Sepoys, ' If you mean. to kldl us, why don't you set about it quickly and get the work done ? Why delay ?' After the padre had read a few prayers he shut the book, and the Sahib-log shook hands all roundThen the Sepoys fired. One Sahib roUed one way, one another, as they sat; but they were i.ot dead, only wounded; so they weut in and finishsd them off wvith swords. Afltr this the whole of the women and children (that is, including those taken out of other boats), to the number of 122. Were taken away to the yellow house, which was your hospital. This was the Bithoor Rajah's house in the civU lines, wherelasnd four more Sepoys were confined, and where I had the opportunity of talking to the sergeant-major's wife. After this, when we (Sepoys) were taken down with the Nena to Futtehpore, the women and children were taken away to the house where they were 'terwards mardered. "' Were any of our women dishon oured by the.Nena orhis people? None that I know of, excepting in the case of General Wheele's youngest daughter, and about this I am not certain. This was her circamstance. As they were taking the memSashibs out of the boat a sowvar (cavalry man) took her away with him to his house. She went quietly; but at night she rose and got hold of the sowar's sword. He was aslep; his wife, his son, and his mother~n-law were sleeping in the house with him. She killed them all with the sword, and then she went and threw herself down the wel behind the house. In the morning, when people came and found the dead in the house, the cry w,s, 'Who has done this?' Then a neighbour said that in t'e night he had seen some one go and throw himself into the well. They went and looked, and there was Missee Baba, dead and swoUen." Our correspondent adds: "I have seen the fearful slaughter-house, and also saw one of the Ist Native Infantry men, according to order, wash up part of the blood which stains the floor before hang. tng. The quantities of dresses, clogged thickly with blood, children's frocks, frills, and ladies' under clothiDg of all kinds, also boys' trousers, leaves of Bibles, and of one book In particular, which seems to be strewed over the whole place,called PreprationforDcwh, also broken daguerreoti-pe cases only, lots of them, and hair, some nearly a yard lonz; bonnets all bloody, and one or two shoes. I picked up a bit of paper with on it, 'Ned's bair, with love,' and opened and found a little bit tied up with ribaud. The first fellows that went In, I believe, saw the bodies witb their arns and legs sticking out through the ground. They had all been thrown in a heap in the well." (From the H-ovneurd .'foil from India, China, and the East, of October 1, 1S57.) We are glad to be able to present our readers with the first authentic narrative which has been received in this country of the events at Cavnpo.e immediately preceding the massacre of the garrison. This painful but singularly interesting document is thus des-ribed by the ofFicer from whom it was received :-" I am enabled to send you a translation made by ryself of about one-half of a nativejournal kept at Oawnpore during the siege. It is, I am afraid, incorrect in some p~articu}ars, but it is in the main a true translation, It was writteum so badly that the natives co4ild not read somne of the wrords, and I was obliged to omit them to make the translation readable without them. The names of the, European merchants cannot be identified, but l have translated thenm as well as I could:-" " For some tinme back there was a report in Cawnpe.eha:, *he-Sovernment woRld serve out to their army cartridge; which had been prepared in the bladders of pigs sn biniock-4 instcrd of psper, and that these cartridges had arrived; or were expected shortly, from England. On this accomnt the minds of the Sepoys, both Hindoo and Massulmnan, ha-Ai2g 'become estrmged from their allegiance to Governuaent, they formed plana for the destruction of the Christians. WMen the Governmeut officers perceived that the Sepyls disobeyed several orders, the collecter, Sahib Bahadoor, aing taklen several elephants belonging to Nena Dhoondu. Pant son of Bajee RPaNeishws, deased, went to the trsAury for the purpose of weighing out the treasure. At that time the sepoys guarding the treasure said,-' Wa will aot let you take away the treasure ,' and altbough- the collector tried his, utmost to load the treaure oni (the elepbants the Sepoys would not let hin take it away, The collector then said, 'I f this is your intention, uert- Monday guards of Eunopean soldiers shall be sent to the nta6azina and tre,, sury.' *)n bearing this the Sepoys and havildm and jeona dar inanimously answered, I'Tis shat unt be sa long as w vs are alive, be ause In these two posts a. lar off Europ'n, soMliers rver was and never bhr,ll .aced,; d, a moreover, if the magazine or treas;re shou!1A go. on cornm nd we wiU accompany it.'

THEL INDI A,N RELIEF FUND. The following address to the Brritislh public has| been issued by the Indian Relief Comsnittee :- "The Comirmlittee for relieviDg the suffering caused by the Indian mutinies, while aoknowledging gratefully the munificent donations already contributed, yet feel it their duty to call attention to the circumstances which necessitate a further appeal to the public. "Throughout the length and breadth of the Bengal i Presidency large numnbers, amounting probably to some thousands, of oivil servants, covenanted and uncovenanted, nilitary officers, chaplains, missionaries, indigo planters, private traders, clerks, civil engineers, persons employed in the Department of i'ub.ic Works, and ethers, have lost their movable property, and, in the present eisturbed state of the country, will have difficulty in raising funds. Without somo kind of pecuniary aid, therefore, they will be unable to reinstate themselves in their previous mode of life. " The families vf persons who have been killed or despoiled of their property, or who, from their beiDg employed in disturbed districts, are unable to make remittances, are to a great extent withont present means of support, whether they are residing in India or in this country; and many children who have been sent to England for education would have to be removed from school if some assistance were not given, " Considering the greatly increased numLer of European troops now to he eis1loyad in India, numb'ering probably nearly 100,000 men, andl the casualties which are likely to take place among them from war and climate, the pecuniary aid which will be required for their families is certain to amount to a Yery large sumI. This observation applies both to Her Majesty's and to the lion. East India Cowpauy', European troops. M Many other classes of persons might be mentioned who wiiU stand in need of assistanoe, including those natives of India, civil and military, or their widows or orphans, whose destitution may be distinctly traceable to fidelity and devotior, to the cause of the British ; bat enough has been said to show that, independently of any assistance which iuay possibly be required iu the Bombay and Madras Presidencies, subscriptions a.e still called for on a scale equal to the greatest efiorts of this kind which have beea. made of late years. In the majority of cases temporary aid will be sufficient; but soms caiems upon the national bounty wil necessamily extend over a considerable period. No suis will be given absolately where a loan would be sufficient. " The principles according to which the relief wivl be administered, in c'lncert with the Calcut'a and other comrmittees, are contained in the following resolutions, which were passed at a meeting held at the Mansion-house on the 26th of September. " Mansion-house, Sept. 30." 1 At a meetin g of the committee held on the 26th of September, 1&57, tht following resolutions were unani* mously adopted: - "1 The object of this commitie is to relieve, as f4r as ulay be practicable wid necessary, the distress caused by the mutiries in India. "*2. In so doing, care should be taken not to supersede the aisistance which 'eught to be iven by the Goverinment, by the establishe(I WVidos' and bphans' Futnds, or by the relations of the sufferers; but to supplement it to the extent to wbich it falls sho-t of a jLst nmeasure of relief. " 3. Compensation for losses, as such, will in no case bh given. " 4. Subject to the preceding conditions, the eo5orts of the comnittee will he snecisllv directed - "First, to enable the sufferers to live with frugality in their respective states of life until other mesab of subsistence are avaiable. " Secondl7, to provide for the maintenance and education of children m cases in which it has been interrupted or pre- I vented by casualties arising out of the mutiny, and in which it cannot be provided for from other sources. "Thirdly, to asist the sufferers to come to this country or to go to India w-hen the circumstances render it proper that they should do so, and the means of paying for their pasage cannot be obtained from aay other source. " Fourthly, to afiord reasona'le aid, by loan or otherwise, te cfficers and others who have lost their equipments, furniture, or other property, by the necessity of sudden flight from their statious or the destruction of their dwellings, when, wi'hout such aid, they would be involved in pecuniary enbarrassmeuts. Fifthly, that relief according to these principles be given, without distinction of religion or nationaLty, to every person of whateser rank who has a just claim upon the sympathy and assistance of the British people, CAMBRIDGE. A meeting of the inhabitants of Cambridge, convened by the Mayor for the purpose of raising a fund for the relief of the sufferers by the mautinies in India, was held on Thursday in the Town-hall, The Mayor, Mr. Patrick Beales, presided, and thore were present, amongr others, the Vice.

Snith, Moyse (J.), Cookerell, Randall, Eiough, Bacon, W. and J. Wetenhall, Bond, CoUier, John Eaden, Ilaley, R. Rove, Brimley and Hammond; the Revs. Mattin (Trinity CoUege), Clayton, Titcomb, Sealey, Banks, Goodwin, Pullen, &c. The YICE-CJIANCELLOR said that in proposing the resolttion intrusred to him he felt that the task was in some respects an easy one. They had all read, and he was sure with the deepest pain and grief, the accounts that had appeared of late in the newspapers, and not withont a feeling of shame that human nature could have faUlen so low as to stoop to the commission ot such atrocities-atrooi. ties of a most inhuman and disgusting character, not committed In the heat of passion, excited by battle or the sacking of towns, but in the most cold blood. In nearly all cases the vetimns were quite unprepared, and in ranny had been living in towns of the most fi-sendly intercourse with those by whom they bad bee;s so inhumanly butchered. He was sure they were all prepared to express their sympathy, but they must go further than that, and see how it could hebees expressed. Exclusive o' ives and families, and of the many sufferers in other places, there were stated to have beenl,64A,i Europeans and Christians lately residing in the priac0,pa} stations ascertained to bave been plundered from Bena- es to Kurnaul; with wives and families included the raffereis might be estimted at more thaX 4,000, 1,siA ot these families wore 3ately living in comfort, with incomes varying from 1001. to 5001. per annum. The majorith werem now refugees at different places. In addition to these were bundreds and hundreds who had arrived in Calcutta in the return steamers ordered to recelve them from the crowded river stations at the shortest wvarning, and who, we learnt from Calcutta papers and private letters, were reaching that place in utter destitution, so that a private subscription had been set on foot, which was headed by Lord Canning with the princely private contribution of 10,000 rupees, 1,000&, Lady Canning giving 2,000 rupees, and which, by last accoints, was increased to about 90,000 rupees by the Calcutta ccmmaunity ; while comnrmuicatious from that vicinity had reached Engiand entreating that more aid might be immediately sent out for these sufferers, and for the mainy still expected to arrive. To those among them who had the means there was everv inducement to give largely, but the value of the subscriptions depended very much upon their nrumber as well as their actual amount. He proposed:- "That this mneeting, sympatbizing with the many belpless sufferers by ite iase musi,,ies in lsoit, who are now recdugd to a state ot _L ttiotien eels itasef cledt u: on to record publicly Itgs ense of this esiocity. and its detestation of tbe atrrcitles of the rebel arur, snd tLe cruelties and inusuigntes perpetrated upo,a helplesm women and ch*ldr-i, wad o,r un'arned fe-low-subjeeta in the Esatt and trusts thatthe e terieeueffortsol the British Government for the reprsiest' of she rebelion asia the punishment of the tulhty may, by the Dirine blersin. be speedily crowned with SuCcoes. Mr. E. B.ALL, M.P., seconded the resolution. He thought it was not out of character if one of the representatives of the county came forward and took part in such a good woil as that, and expressed his willingness and readlness to assist those who met for the purpose of expressing their determination to support any Government who would vigorously put down or stay the progress of those tens of thousands of demons in human shape who had thus outraged humanity. (Cheers). It was a very great circumstance that the whole of the nations of Europe, laying aside all distinctions, had come forward to express their hatred of the past, and to support and comfortthose who had mnore immediately su.fered. France, by her Emperor, had come forward to offer her oblation and sympathy; even the Turk was melted by the tale of our people's sufferings, and hbad sent his contribution. There was nothing, however, that a.fected the puhlic mind so much as ihat in the country wbere we had first won fame and honour, humanity, instead of being observed, had been outraged; the bodies of English womnen had been violated and outraged, and thrust our after inhuman murder into the streets, their only cover' iug being the bcolies of their own murdered children. (Hear, hese.r.) The MASTER Of ENfAXUERL COLLEG.E said that he had been requested to propose a resolution, in the absence of the Master of Trinity College. The torrents of blood that had been ahed, the hundreds of children and women who had been cruelly put to deathi, after having undergone the most unbumnan cruelties that could he perpetrated, are subjects too painful to be discussed. They had heard of English ladies imploring their husbands to put them to deasth at once rather than expose them to the barbarous acts of the mutinees. It was toogrievoustosaythatiintoo many i;istances the reqluests of thoseladies hnd beencomplied within too many InstaLnces the British of'ficers bad been compelled to put to death their own wives, and afterwards deliberately shoot themselves. Hle believed that an attempt had been made to trace this terrible catastrophe to some adveree cause. Some had 'olamued the Governuitnt at home; some blamed the Govermient in India; and another silly attemupt had 1-eon iade to saddle the blame upon our missionaries, as if, forsooth, they had not enough to do in perform.ng their duties; but he beheved, in regard to any blame being attached to the missionaries, there could not be a more groundless charge. Hle believed, on the contrary, that ouir mizsionaries had long met with suDport from the Hindoo and the Mahomedau, or they would not have pune the lengths they had. Ee would now read the followsDg resolution:- * That to mset the eityeme urzgncy- of the cas and reliove the pr ssing want of Ihe sufferers now depending epon others for clothing ad Icud. n aaditlort, their cruel loss of husbands and parexts, this rtmeetiog oans,eetly o,tr,-ats the bs,secolentcont,lhbtions of the inh3bltauts of Catbridge and the meunbersof the TTuiveruity, and that the scetral baukers be requ,.stod to receive eubreriptions. and that the S-si's be authorized to forwhrd the came to the comnmittee Ln Lon- M5r. A.derman ]TAPPRrS seconded the reeolution. hIr. Alderman FAN V(ETT, in moving a Vote Of thanks to the Mayor, sail the atrocities of the S,epoys had no parallel in history. As long as history should last the name of Nena Sahib wronld bh hold up to execration as that of the most awful fiend that ever cursed God's earth. (Applause.) In fact, to use the language of one of the wretch's own coun. trymen, he was a very incarnation of the devil. (Applause.) Ile had heard from a friend that a lady and two children had just arrived in this country in a rnutllated state; but the . u11 extent of the atrocities vwould neverbe thoroughly known, as the murdered anid many of the murderers had gone to their long home. The Itev. Dr. CA.rTMELL, Master of Christ's College, ceconded thu resolution. The MicVOI: In returning thanks, stated that he had received several letters promising subscriptions. The first was from Mr. Adeane, requesting his name to be put down for 251. ; another frons the Master of St. John's College, nho wats now in Lancashire, for 51.; the Vice-Chancellor had put his name down for 101.; Mr. E. Ball, 5U. ; Rev. C. Clayton, 5l.; EbeneYer Fuster, 51.; and his own small trifle vould be added. TLhe neeting then corcluded. At the close, the request made by the Mayor was most l:berally responded to by several gentleman putting down their names for varicus sums of morey. WOOL WICI. Major Ceneral Sir W. F.

INDIA. [A portion of the following appeared In our second edition of yesterday:-] WVe have received files of Calcutta papera to the 23d of August, and our private correspondence and files of papers from Hongkong to the 10th of August. We take the following summary of news from the Bengal Hurkarz. of the 23d of August:- "The mutinies are still developing, and theinsurrection is taking a consistent form. Tojudge by present appearances,there woil soon be scarcely a regiment or a district that has not caught the infection, in Bengal or the North-West. There was a lull of several days soon after the departure of the last mail, during which things seemed at their worst, for all communication with the North-West and Bombay was completely cut off, and the rebellion showed the most uinmistakable signs of narrowing its circle roand Calcutta. Since -then a change for the better has taken place. The communication has been restored, and the news obtained by this means turns out to befarmore favourable thanmost persons had expected. Reinforcements had arrived at Delhi, and the besiegers were making more impression upon the place than they had ever done before, were in better spirits, and had the fullest confidence in their speedy and triumphant success. The besieged were in a wretched condition, and, it is said, had offered terms of capitulation, which had been refused, not because they were unsatisfactory, but becauee no terms at aU could be accepted. After the marny false reports which have been circulated upon the subject, we can scarcely expect our readers to share our confidence when we once more express our belief that Delhi will have fallen long before this sheet is in their hands. But such is now the general inapression, and it is justified by the strongest facts. The besieged, it is known, are nearly without ammunition, having for some time past been firing pieces of telegraph wire and kunkiur from their muskets, and they are, besides, fast being decimated by famine and disease. ' Thenevws fromAgrais equally satisfactory. After the battle which we recorded in our last Overland Summary, the fort, where the garrison and Winhabitants had taken refuge, has not been threatened, though all the houses in cantonments and the ciril lines have been destroyed by the budmashes (i. c., blackguards) of thecity and the 3,000prisoners whom, in spite of warnings which they have received for years past, the Government insisted upon keeping in the heart of the station. The value of the property thus destroyed is immense, for the merchants were prosperous, and their large shops abounded with the most costly articles of necessiiy or luxury, obtained from home at great expense, and for the loss of which they, as well as the other sufferers, need not, and of course do not, expect to obtain one sixpence of compensation. The books of the Agra Bank are supposed to be destroyed-a circumstance which was deeply lamented by those who were indebted to that institution, as the loss would have prevented them from liquidating the claims against them. The spirits of these persons (a numerous class) have, however, risen again upon hearing that a duphcate of all the accourts is kept in Calcutta (which we belUeve to be the case), so that they willj be, after all, spared the pain of occasioning any loss to the bank. It is scarcely fair to throw blame upon any precautionary measures which have had the effect of sparing human life, but it is the opinion of many persons in Agra, wel qualified to judge, that it was a mistake to abandon cantonments (except as far as the noncombatants were concerned), and that the station might have been spccesdully held and saved from destruction, which was brought upon it, not by the mutineers, but by the unarmed nrisoners and the rabble of the place. " Our troops still hold Cawnpore and Allahabad, but General Havelock has been unsuccessful in the relief of Lucknow. After displaying great activity, and figbting more battles than were ever fought before in so short a time, he has fallen back upon Cawnpore, with a force, it is feared, considerably weakened, but which has, for aU that, done wonder'. It is believed, bowever, that, though unable to relieve Lucknow, his presence in its neighbourhood enabled thebesieged to establish a communication with theoutside, and to obtain supplies, which will enable them tohold out for some time longer thanthey couldotherwise have done. What is to be the next plan for their relief we are not aware, but it is said that Sir James Outram is to perform the work by operations from another direction. The greatest anxiety is naturally felt for the safety of Lucknow, and there are not wanting suspicions that it has already fallen; but these cannot be traced to any justifiable source, and we should be sorry to encourage them without good cause, especially as a catastrophe at Lucknow similar to that of Cawnpore would be far more horrible, because the garrison is larger, and the number of ladies and children far greater. Up to the present time, we repeat, there is no ground for apprehension on this score. ":The most cheering event of the fortnight is the arrival of Sir Colin Campbell and his appointment from home as Commander-in-Chief. The qualifications of Sir Patrick Grant for the post are undoubted; but, while rejoicing that the progress of liberal views had permitted the chief command to be heldby a Company'sofficer,the community hereforgot that this very circumstance would deprive Sir Patrick of all power to act with effect. Sir Patrick Grant, had he been a Queen's officer, might have done good byactin%g independently and fearlessly doing his duty. Sir Patrick, being a Company's officer, had his hau. s tied. He could do nothing unless his advice happened to be acceptable to others, or unless he ck.ose to make the advice of others acceptable to himself. Under theec circumstances, it was mere nonsense bringing him from Madras, as he soon began to think himself. So as soon as possible after the arrival of Sir Colin Campbell, he prepared to return to the conmmand of his habitual Sepoys, and, if reportsBay, truly, the 17 gums which announced his departure yesterday morning were the sweetest sounds he has heard for some time. " Sir Colin Cauipbell has the opportunity which was denied to Sir Patrick Grant; and those 'who best l:now the character of the former gallant officer are the least likely to suppose that he will let the opportanity escape. The best means of giving Sir Colin Campbell the authority which we all feel that he ought to hold would be to proclaim military law throughout the Bengal Presidency, and a petition to this effect has already been extensively signed and presented to the Governor-General. Now that the Mohurrumn is. just Gonamencing, this question is one of particular importance, and all we hope Is that the measuxe will not be found necessary after the mischief has been done. It is due, however, to the Goveriament to say that very extensive arrangements have been made for the protection of the city, pickets of regtular troops and the Volunteer Guards bei-g posted day and night at the principal points, and patrola being kept up at aU hours. Con3idering all these precautions, it is not expected that any serious disturbantce wvill arise." (From the Calt-utta EnglishLma of Autgut 22.) Since oar last despateh, and till within the last three days, we have been without news from the Upper Provinces, the Dinapore and Ramghur mutineers having intercepted the dawks, and on% or tws o mails are reported to have been butrtnt. The dispersion of these scvaadrcel has, hlwivl r, asin pPt- tially restored our communications, t4e telegraph is again in action as far as Oawnpore, and a stray letter or newspaper occasionally reaches us from the NorthWest. Prospects are still sufficiently gloomy, but a slight gleanm of sunshine has at last reached U3s in the news that the garrison of Delhi are quarrelling among themselves, and are in want of provisions and ammunition. The besiegers, too, have been strongly reinforced before this time, and we may shortly expect to hear of the fall of the city. It is stated, but not upon certain authority, that the mutineer3 have offered to surrender on condition of a certain number being spared, and that the answer given them was that they must surrender at discretion. This is, at all events, probable, for no British officer wonld be base enough to pardon the asrassinw of Bareilly, Mleerut, and Delhi. rhe latest date from Delhi which has reached Government is the 14th inst., and reportsthe probable speedy dispersion of the mutineers. We have had two more mutinies sinee the departure of the last mail, but not of much importance. The Hill Rangers and the Ramghur Battalion have inscribed their names in the roll of traitors, and gone off with their arms, but we have not heard of any more assassinations. We are, however, stil in great anxiety for the garrison of Lucknow, and for the number of families which it protects. General Havelock has returned to Cawnpore, not having troops enough to force his way to Lucknow; and we hear that General Ouitram has stopped all the reinforcements in progress towards Cavnpore) with the intention of proceeding up the Gogra or the Goomtee, and reaching Lucknow in the opposite direction. Several of the Sikh Sirdars have been detained in Calcutta under sirreillance ever since the last Punjab war. They are eager for employment, and at last the services of one of them, Gholab Singh, have been accepted. From the beginning of the mutiny the Sikhs have everywhere shown steady fidelity to theBritishGovermnent, andtheir conduct inthePunjab might have been expected to induce our rulers to avail themselves at once of the services of men so influential anmoug them as these chiefs, but only a tardy and partial acceptance has been given. In the Punjab the energy of the Commissioner and the fidelity of the people have complete]y crushed the mutiny, and either destroyed or disarmed all the disaffected regiments. It is stated that the new levies there, expected to be ready for service at the commencement of the cold season, wiU amount to 30,000 men. This wiU render it unnecessary to restore any portion of the mutinous and inefficient Bengal army. We have now an excellent Comimander-in-Chiefthat is, if his hands are not tied by red tape. Sir Patrick Grant resumes his command at Madras, and it is currently reported that he has declared that while here he was a mere cipher, having responsIbility without power, and that he is glad to retzrn to a place where he feels that he can be of sorme use.

Sir,-I have much pleasure in reporting, for the information of the officer commanding the Dinapore Division, the safe arrival here of the field force under my coimmand, and the relief of the party defending themselves at Arrah, nith ahov have jtLst opened a satisfas'toiy conm munication, and bave received your letter, dated Slat ultimo, front which 1 exceedingly regret to learn the severe loss sustained by the detachument co-opeiating with us on the Dinapore side; but I venture to affrm confidently that no such dis aster vwould have been likely to ocecr had that detachment advanced less precipitately, so as to have given full time for my force to approach direct from the opposite side, for the rebels would theti have been bemmed in between the tv, opposing forces and maust have been utterly routed. IT. ly former letters, of the 30th ultimo and Ist instant will, I hope, have informed yott of my advance from 1Bixar on the evenin of the fiist-named date. We pushed on with aU practicable speed to Shavwpore, distant 28 miles, where rumours of the Dinapore disaster reached us,. Hearing that the enemy designed to destroy the bridges en route' we again pushed on at 2 p.m., as far as BuUowtee, where we found the bridge cnt through-an hour's halt sufficed to repair It, which we employed also in bnrning the villages on either side, since we had caught their inhabitants in the act of deasruction. Arriving at GocjerajgZunge by nightfall I was deligh ted to find the bridge entire; here we bivouacked for the night, and at daybreak nest morning resumed our march, but had only proceeded abont a mile beyond Gooierajgunge when we discovered the enemy in great force in possession of the wroods to our front and fianks. The road by which we had to reach the wo6d ia our front was bounded by inunda ted paddy fields 'on either side. I halted to observe the best conrse to pursue, and finding that tht enemy were weakerirg tl,eir frrnt to take us on both 114nks, I bol ly pushed fors'ard, throming out skirmishers in every direction. The Enfield rifMes kept our foes at a distance, and we succeeded in forcing the wood, beyond whicb, as far as Beebeegunge, it lay across an open swamp, which greatly befriended us. Meanwhile the baffled enemy were observed hurrysag round to oppose us at Beebeegunge, which is sitnate on the opposite tide of a bridge by vwhich we had hoped to cross the river. HTere I again halted to refresh the troops and to reconnoitre. Finding the bridge had been destroyed, extensive earthen breastworks raised on the other ride flankin.ig the bridge, ard the mutinous regiments in force occupying the houses in.the viUlage, Idetermnined on making a detour to the right, as far as the railway earthworks, about a mile off. I masked this movement for a time by the fire of my guns, but no sooner did the eremy discover our purpose, than they hurried with their entire strength to intercept us at a wood which it was necessary for us to pass; a portion of them followed us up in the rear, and by the time we reac hed the wood we found quite as much on our hands ae we could manage. They mustered some 2,000 to 2,500 strong in SepoyS alone, besides Rajah Cooer Siogh's irregular forces, of whom, however, we made little account. The RI jah was apparently present in person, and for upwards of an hour we were cornpelled to act solely on the defensive. The Sepoys, apparently emboldered by their recent suecess beyond Arrah, advanced to the assault with a rigour quite unexpected, and twice, with their bugles sounding fErst the "Assembly," thon the "Advance " and the " Double," made determined rushes on the guns, but were on both occasions repulised vwith showers of grape. Meanwhile Captain L'Estrange, with the gallant 5th, was not idle, as wilh be seen bh his own report, hereto appended. Finding at length that the enemy grew emboldened by the superiority of their numbers and the advantage of their position, I determrined on trying the effecl of a general charge of the infantry, anr sent Captain the Hon. E. P. Hestings to Captain L'E,trange with orders to that efFect. Promptly and gallant!y he obeyed the order: the skirmishers on the right turned their fank, the guns %ith grape and shrapnel drove in the centre, and the troops advancing on alL sides drove the enemy pauizstruck in all directions. Thus our road was cleared. AUl beyond the country was open, and we proceeedc without further internp!ion to vwithin four miles of Arrah, wrhea we vere suddeulv bronght up by 1n impassable river. au have iic,ce beer. emuployed in attempting to bridge it over.

CHINA. (FROM OUII OWh' OORBZSPONDVNT.1 [A portionof the foUowig appero6d In our secondedition I ot JoBt4& :-*I HONGKONG, JULY 16. On the 13th the French Admiral came into harbour. On the 14th the opiuni-steamer Launcefield arrived from Calcutta, bringing advices to the 19th of June, communicating certain intelligence of the spread of the mutiny and only an uncertain probabmity of the fall of Delhi. In thiz little community, where everything is watched, where everything is known, and whera nothing Is secaet for more than a quarter of an hour, it was immediately notorious that the Plenipo, and tLe General, and the Admiral, and the French Admiral were in earnest communication. Then It transpired that orders hd been issued to the ships under orders for ths north not to take in the extra quantity of coals previously ordered. So the expedition to the Peiho had beuen abandoned, greatly to the joy of every denizen of Hongkong. Shortly after there were gentlemen In the Queen?s-road who could repeat the very woras used at the " Council of War;" how the General said "that he could not hold that city without some fabulous amount of men," how the Aidmiral said "that he would showhim the way In," and how the French Admiral rermarked that " if the English would take the placa the French would hold It." Of course there were rival versions. Another report stated that the General insited upon storming the city at the head of the 59th, and that the stopping of the coaling of the ships was evidently to decrease their draught of water and lot them up to shell the fort. Tne one ruling idee Jixe is-take Canton. Every one who comes here is dominated by it In tenx minutes. Even Lord Palmeorton, if he were here, would, after a gallant fight about some of the red tape of diplomacy and some thumbing of his httle Yankee book on the law of nations, give In and cry, " Va o 14 cite." Mr. Cobden would be hurried away In much less time, and find himself garrisoning Magazine-hill before he had coUidered how he should explain the transaction to Mr. Caird. No wonder, then, that, seeing that this taking of Canton is to us upon the spot the evident and only solution of the difficulty, every movement is reeeived as an intimation that the coup Is about to be made. Nothing, however, is at present further from our leaders' thoughts than the taldng of Canton. As I Intimated In my last letter, the subject has been considered, and all authorities are agreed that although the city might be destroyed, It could not be taken and held. So far from the French having Intimated a different opinion, it is no secret that they for the present decline any aetive co-operation of any kind. The Chinese, who havea spy in every " boy" who stands behind your chair, and in every coolie who pulls your punkab, get earlier informatiop- than the English. There is a Chinamas, a painter and copier of charts, in the Queen's-road, whose shop is like the shop of Pasquin. " Ey yaw," said this authority about 4 o'elock yesterday, " You no catchee that city. What for your number one big Mandarin run away, ey I" The celestial ,man of art was right. Lord Elgin had resolved to start for Calcutta. An hour afterwards, and we had the announcement that " the Pearlwillleave for Calcutt3 and take letters for Singapore and Europe," and the information did not long lag that Lord Elgin was to accompany her in the Shannon. Of course the Chinese chuckle, and the merchants are dispirited. I am convlnced, however, that it was the only wise cours open to Lord Elgiln He will take a force of 1,500 blue-jacket, and marines to Calcutta. This will compose the minds of the inhabitants of the City of Palaces, and the fact of his arrival may have a benefcial moral effect, ehowing that the whole Chinese expedition Is present and ready to aet upon India; the high Commissioner accompanying them. Moreover, he will know after a fortnight's stay at Calcutta what probability there is of Lord Canning being able to restore him his troops, or to replace them by native Indian regiments. These advantages, however, are contingent and collateral. The real consideration I take to be thazt it is the only escape from a false position. If he had gone to the Peiho he would have met there an insult which he is without force to resent. The French Admiral brings intelligence that the Baron de Gros will not be here for two months, so that if Lord Elgin had rermained here he would have afforded a spectacle to the Chinese, and also to Europe, of a British Plenipotentiary awaiting the leisurely pleasure of our good allies. Of course the state of India could not have been foreseen, but, making all allowances for this disturbing circumstance, the people at home seem to have sadly bungled this matter. The self-evident course was to send out a sufficient force to punish Yeh-to take possession of the city, out of which he had driven us-to inflict punishment for his attempts at wholesale poisoning and for his proclamations inviting our assassination. Then, with Canton in our hands, and with the balance in the war of reprisals in our favour, Lord Elgin might have come out and presented himself with dignity at the Court of Pekin. He might ha,ve said, " Your officer has broken the treaty, and committed upon your allies the most savage outrages. We have punished him on the spot; and we come now to ask you either to disown him and to indemnify us for his misconduct, or to acknow. edge him and make this a national quarreL" Inistead of this, we can read Lord Elgin's instructions in the paragraph of the Queen's Speech and In the proposed expedition to the Peiho as clearly as if they were printed In the Gazette. He is to present himself at Pekin, while the Chinese are in possession of the cause of quarrel, and believe, and rightly believe, that they have upon the whole the best of the contest. He will find at the Peiho the same feeling which cause I the risings at Singapore and Penang, and at Sarawak -a feeling generated by the simple fact that the English have been driven out of Canton, and have not been able to force their way back; he will be rudely snubbed or entangled in long and fruitless Inegotiations. Then comes the expensive expedient of a declaration of war. The four portswill be closed,the Chancellor of the Exchequer's 10,000,000oL will be cruelly clipped, and the Yankees will stop in and carry off the profits of British trade. Precious time wvill have been lost and our position sacrificed, in order that Lord Palmerston may have no breach of eUtquette upon his conscience. A state of war with the Emperor of China costs us 10,000,OOO a-year ia home revenue and commercial profits; a border war of reprlsals costs us nothing but the e:rpnse of the force employed. Yet we play our last card first; we stop our reprisals and commence our war, in order to apply to a barbarous Asiatic ceremonies of Western chivalry which he can neither appreciate nor understand. Verily, Sir John Bowrlng, much abused as he is both here and at home, has taken a more common-sense view of these mbtters than the high diplomatis of England and Frace. About the end of ,September, when the Gulf of Pechelee is swept bY storms and the anchorage is insecure, the English and French Plenipotentiarieg wI probably renew the postponed expedition to the Peiho. They will act in sweet accord-the English to open trade for the whole world3 the French to open the Raoman Catholic religion to the world of China. At the end of October they wiU be precisely where we all are in this month of July. Lord Elgin embarks to-day at 2 o'clock. I sball go and study certain commercial questions at the four ports-while they are yet open to Englishmen. On tbe Yello w Se& stexiner BRam, JTaly 31. Goodbye to Hongkong. On Saturday, the 25th of July, under a vertical sun and over an unrufaed sea, the Remi steamed out of Hongkong harbour. The ships of war, with their awnings spread and their flags drooping down the spars, seem to feel the lassitude which oppresses all animal life. The junks are spreading their damaged silks to dry, covering their rigging, with reds and yellows, which mingle so badly in detail, but contrast so gorgeously in masses. They are also chin-chin-ing their Josses for prosperous passages-firing off crackers and sending lighted paper lanterns afloat upon the harbour. We take leave of the familiar spots and prominent points in the city of Victoria, and as it recedes from view we wonder how so small a speck upon so smanll an island can hold 70,000 people. We have escaped from that dominating and oppressing mountain, and that humid heat. Rey for the north I Hongkong itself Is only one of that multitude of ten thousand islands which fringe the Chinese coast from the Gulf of Tonquin to the Gulf of Pechelee, and as we move out through that strait which separates it from the main land, and forms its admirable harbour, we only involve ourselves among other barren islands and in other intricate channels. The south-west monsoon, however, blows gently aft, and it is pleasant upon the quarter-deck of the Reml. A merchant, with whom I have much confederated, is come on board, accompanied by boxes of ice and caes of creature comforts; and there Is an American captain, who is cunning in strange beverages. There is not much to see, but life is not unendurable. Next morning we are closely hugging the mainland, and can distinguish populous towns upon the coast. How rife is human life in this region. Wherever the eye wauders thousands upon thousands of fishing boats cover the sea in troops 1nnumerable. These are the minnows of these waters. Now and then, with ample snowy canvass, a British-built schooner speeda by, sailing like a yacht for a regatta cup, but armed to the teeth.That is one of the far-famed opium cllppers, and she calls Jardine, or Dent, or Russell, or EHeard her owner. She is the trout of the water. There are plenty of pike, but they are lurking out of view. If that schooner were to be becalmed, or our machinery were to break down, they would soon show themselves. In the afternoon of our second day's voyage we were off Swachow. Three low pyramidal hills,behind which lie many square-rigged vessels, their spars visible above the elbows of the hills, form a breakwater to a convenient bay, and at the top of that bay lies a city where a large foreign commerce has sprung up despite the opposition of the authorities. The surrounding country and the opposite coast of Formosa produce large quantities of sugar, and the dangers of piracy have enabled the Europeans to monopolize the carrying trade which was formerly carried on by the junks. The junks bring some of the coarse sugars over from Formosa, but when purified it is too valuable a cargo to be trusted to native bolt toms. Swachow will be a considerable commercial port when a new treaty has placed China within the comity of nations. Next we pass the island of Namoa-very classic land. Namoa is a collegiate city; literary men abound there, and much opium is smoked. Onetwentieth part of the whole quantity imported into China is delivered from the Namoa station. But, notwithstanding the depressing influences of Chinese literature and British opium, Namoa is a well-cultivated isand. Barley is growing all up the hills wherever the rocks allow, and rice is cultlvated at the bottom, where the collected drainage affords a constant moisture. The morning of our third day shows us Chapel Island-a rock with a natural tunnel through it. It is the outlying picket to the Amoy Archipelago. Amoy is one of our lawful ports of trade, and thither we are bound. It took last year abou 120,0001. worth ($471,689) of our cottons, and 3,0001. ($11,430) worth of our woollens, and it gave us in return sugar and sugar candy, some indifferent tea, and a little camphor and alum. lt is not a very large affair, this Amoy trade; but, as it is an established fact, we must look at the place. As we stand in from Chapel Island we appear to be entering a deep bay in the mainland. The land we have before us is, however, really the two islands of Koolongas and Amoy, so close together that the strait between them seems only the upper end of a bay. There are three Mandarin junks flaunting their gaudy banners, and one of them is firing a shot to bring to a boat. But these brave-looking war craft are said to have a marvellously good understanding with the pirates outside, and to be well out of the way whenever any enterprise is going on which is undertaken in force. Besides the Malndarin's there are numerous junks of commerce, many lorchas-hybrid things, half European, half Chinese,-and several European vessels. The Comus should show her pennant here, but she is away upon a cruise, and the defence of Amoy is left to our picturesque and gaudy Mandarin friends, with their lofty sterns and their carved prows. As we advance into the harbour between the two islands we pass over the spot where the English fleet, in the first war, blew out of the water the only Chinese fleet that ever ventured to come out to meet them. To our left, on the Island of Koolongsu, is the walled graveyard where moulder the bones of the Englishmen who taught the Chinese of these parts a lesson they still remember. Further up upon our right lies the city of Amoy. There are four houses which are evidently built for purposes of European residence. The rest of the place in its water-side point of view looks like a small slice of Wapping in very bad repair, and grotesquely painted. I found a lady in Amoy who resented my asking her if she were resigned to her residence there, and who de- olared that of all spots out of England it _as that she should choose to live in. Women find their happiness intheir duties, and they bear them with them to every climate. But Amoy is not a place to be loved for itself. With a chair and four bearers I traversed the town in every direction. Amoy is a real unsophisticated Chinese town, and I expected something entirely new in character. Alas I there is nothing new, even under the sun of China. Amoy is almost exactly like every other tenth-rate Eastern town. Tt has the smell of Lower Thames-street in hot noon-day. It has the booth-shaped, one-storied houses whereof the Arabsahave built Constantine, whereof the Turks have built the baser parts of Smyrna, and which are to be found also in the Egyptian part of Alexandria. It is a congeries of huts with open fronts. Upon the floor is heaped and exposed for sale every indescribable edible in the Chinese dietary. Some hiesing hot are for immediate consumption; lumps of roast pork, stews curiously eompounded of gelatinous matter, a small square piece of meat, and vegetables of different kinds cut into long regular strips. Some coldly taint the air and call for fire and quick consumption, such a fresh fish, caught perhaps in the bay a few houz-s before, but now rapidly decomposing, Livid joints of beef hang upon bamboo poles, despite ths precepts of Po; and within reach of their odour is a mountain of Chinese confectionery-bean cakes, looking like cakes of honey soap; dark treacly substances. which quiver as they are divided into small portions ; and a light compound which looks like that pleasant mixture of honey and almonds wherein the Turks are so cun. Ding. There were shops also full of bamboo work, and others where John Chinaman, naked to his hips, was at work upon rude furniture; but I saw nothing which ministered to the elegancies of life, except a warehouseful of artificial flowers. I had abundant leisure to observe Amoy in all its details. The streets were so narrow that my palan. quin, not two feet wide, could not pass between the merchandise on either side. The proprietor stood by to protect it as we scraped past. About six times in the course of our long peregrinations we came upon processions from the opposite quarter. Some great or little Mandarin, with a body guard armed with trident spears, appeared in his palanquin darectly in my front, and stared at me with a mild interest. In Amoy every Europeau face is known, and they are not difficult to count. To pass was physically imposible, and there was always much shouting, but I could not detect any tendency to be uncivil to the strAnger. Once, by the aid of some bystanders,and favoured by the construction of the shops on either side, I was lifted bodily over the head of the Mandarin; sometimes we managed to squeeze by, and sometimes we remained in position until a way could be cleared through the merchandise. Then "Ya-ho, ya-ho" sang the bearers, and away they went knocking everything about that did not get out of their way. We passed a few Joshouses, which are in form quite alike, and are exceedingly well represented in the temple depictured upon a willow pattern plate, but beyond these I saw no public building. The city of Amoy is about a mile and a half in diameter, and the residence of Mr. Morrison, the consul, is just outside the city wall on the opposite side from the harbour. The city wall Is a structure which would not defend an orchard from the incursions of an English schoolboy. The consular residence is the most pleasant residence in this part of the world; large, airy, and convenient, and with a spacious verandah, through which the sea breeze blovrs with grateful freshnes There are gardens all round it, and a nound whence there is a prospect of the surrounding country. From the top of the mound I had an opportunity of seeing a marching column of the Amoy Militia, who were defiling along the bank of a small lake. The uniform of the Amoy M3itia In not strictly maintained, and their order of march is not one of Eevere precision. Some of themwore the hugebamboo hats which an English frult-stall keeper vwould use to hold bushels of apples and to display hundreds of oranges, but which the Chinese peasants wear as shields from the sun and rain. Others abaudoned their shorn heads and pendent tails to the fierceness of the midday heat. They all wore a sleeveless cotton jacket with some Chinese characters printed upon it; but in other respects they presented every variety of the Coolie garb-naked feet and legs, leathern sandals, thick-soled Chinese shoes, loose trousers, and cotton breeches and stockings, were all equally tolerated among the Amoy Militia. They straggled along without much order. Two or three braves with trident spears walked first, then followed the arquebuss men, carrying their guns as the spies from the land of Canaan brought back their trophies, two men to each arquebuse. Then came some warriors with large wicker shields and short swords, and, lastly. upon a pony came the venerable leader of thetroop, two men holding a large parachuts formed parasol over his head. Returning from the consulate 1 visited the merchant's " go-downs," and saw the preparation of the teas for the English and colonial markets. The outer bamboo casings were being stripped off, and coolies with tow and cungee (rice paste) were affixing upon the coarsest possible teas printed labels descriptive of very superior quality. I waitold that these teas were too bad to hope to find any market in England, but they would be bought up for the Western States of America, for Canada, and for our other colonies. The prices are very high. The buyers have in some instaunes been paying more for teas in China than, according to the last accounts, they would sell for in England. One day is abundance for Amoy. Having obtained all the statistics I wanted from the consul, and having noted all the information I could obtain from the merchants, I was glad to get on board the Remi again, and to find myself steaming out of harbour before sundown. Yet even at Amoy commerce ig winning Its way, and the operations are increasing. In the afternoon of the next day we sighted the "White Dogs"-rocky islets at the mouth of the Min. Here we were to leave the mail for Foochow, another ofJ our treaty ports, situate 40 miles up that dangerous river. I wanted to go to Foochow, and there were several mereantile people on board who were very anxious to know the price of teas there; but they only smiled when I proposed to go up in the mail-boat. When I argued that where Her Mlajesty's mails could be trusted our carcasses and packages could not be in much danger, they replied that the river pirates knew that Her Majesty's mails consisted of " chits" not worth one dollar to a pirate, but that no instance had yet occurred of a chest of opium or a box of treasure being trusted to this conveyance. I had calculated on meeting a stout sailing-boat, manned by an English crew. I own I was a little astonished to ftnd at the appointed place a miserable Chinese sampan, manned by anoldChinaman and his two sons. Three nights in such a vemsel as this vas not an encouraging prospect; and when I was told that I might possibly be detained a month before I should find an opportuiity of going thence north to Shanghai, I felt that a port having such spars facilities of access could not offer very valuable opportunities for investigation. Foochow is of importance to us as a tea port. Tn 1856 40,972,6001b. were exported, valued at 1,525,0001. Of these 23,880,8001b. came to Great Britain, and in return Foochow took 110,000 pieceS cf our gray and white longeloths and 1,000 pieces of long ells, valued together at -0,2501. The rest was paid in bullion. The balance of trade, therefore, is at this port altogether against us, and I am told upon the authority of a man who knovo the country well that, as a tea port Foochow, is altogether a mistake. Higher up upon the coast, just upon the division line which separates the provinces of Fuhkien and Cheikiang, lie the bay and city of Fuhning. I am told that the tea which is brought down to Foochow is all carried upon men's backs across the high chain of mountains, and comes from the neighbourhood of Fuahning, which is the centre of this tea district. I am told also that when teas were selling at Foochow at26 taels a picul they might be bought atubming at 13 taels per picul, and that the interruptions which have occurred togettingtheteasdownto Foochowthl5 year are occasioned by the difEculties of the mountain transit, and would not operate if we went to Fuhning and embarked them there. When a new treaty shall have given us freedom to trade along the whole of the coast Foochow will probably go out of existence as a commercial porL As it is we have been several times on the point of abandoning it. Next day we pass Wanchow upon the coast. We are now coasting along one of the most denselypeopled provinces of China, and the seaboard is studded with great cities. Wanchow carries on a tolerated trade with us, and we get tea, xilk, salr alum from that port. This treacherous Chinese sea is still blue and calm and beautiful, although it is the full season of typhoons, and we have been coursing the fu'l length of the channel of Formosa, which is thought to be the birthplace of all typhoons. During our fifth night at s we fell in with a dismasted ship, which refused our proffered amsistance and dis. appointed our captain's hope of salvage, but which reminded us passengers that these sldes do not always smile. Not long after, in the clear moonlight, three large, heavily-armed junks came swoop. ing round ;us-no doubt they will also visit our dismasted friend; but he has made himself pretty taught by this time, and will not be an easy prey. On the sith day of our voyage we stand out to sea, and keep outside the Chusan group. The sacred isle of Puto is just viaible through my glass, and I can see no -mall object in Chusan. To-morrow morning we shall arrive early at Woosung, and proceed up the river to Shanghal, and, as I shall only arrive jumt in time to catch the home-going mail, I will now close this letter. (FRO ANOTHX CORRPONDaiT.) HON{GKONG, AuGLUsT 10. The steamer Cadiz, bringing the London mail of the 26th of June, arrived here on the 6th instant. The Ganges, with the outward mails, leaves today. The principal item of Interest which we have to call attention to by this mail is the notification, in the Government Gazde of the 4th instant, that a blockade of the port and river of Canton would be established on the 7th instant. We understand Admiral Sir Michael Seymour has been induced to adopt this course in consequence of the American steamer Antelope having proceeded up the river as far as WVhampoa, and it was the impresdon that the Americans and some other foreigners were desirous of forcing a trade with Canton, which, it is said, Yeh would not object to. We have yet to see the effect this measure will have on the small trade now existing here and at Macao. If restrictions on interoourse continue for any length of time, they will, no doubt, be seriously felt by the Cantonese. Her Majesty's steamer Fury left for Singapore on the 28th ult. to bring on here, it is said, the meen of the 59th Regiment which were on board the illfated Transit. IHer Majesty's steamer Tribune left for Manilla on the 8th inst. She towed the ship Northfleet, bound for London, with invalids on board, clear of the harbour. The troopships Neleus and Moreafort arrived from England on the 8th inst., with about 500 men of the3:Royal Artillery, besides officers. It is unfortunate that these vensels were not intercepted in the Straits, and ordered on to Calcutta, It is the intention to send round a portion of this force in Her Majesty's steamer Sampson immediately. Trade at Hongkong shows signs of improving, and there has been some demand for manufactures As we have said, we have to see yet whether inquiry will cease in consequence of the river being blockaded.

FOREIGN INTELLIGEMOY. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN COORESPONDRNT.) IA portion of the followixg appeared In our second Aitlhn of -e-A.. .-1 fAK-W, WEDNEDAY, SaxPT. 30, 6 P.M. Letters and arrivals from Stuttgart confirm the belief lately expressed, that the interview of the Emperors was but a frigid affair. The arrival of the Empress, which tool, everybody by surprise, seems to have acted, although it be ungallant to say so, as a wet blanket. only two days before the French Minister at Stuttgart had said publiclythat there was not the least probability of her coming. According to French accounts, the Emperor Alexander did not gleanmany"goldenopinions from all sortsof people." n the first place they laugh at him for going in a Circassian uniform, and say that Napoleon might as well have gone attired as a Zouave. Then they say that he neither looked, nor was, amiable. They find fault with him for leaving the theatre after the first act of the performance, and not returning, while the French Emperor sat it out. In short, they seem to think that the style and manner of the Russian Sovereign contrasted unfavourably with Napoleon's easy, natural, unaffected ways. The deficiencies of the Monarch-if any there really werewere in some measure atoned for by his Minister. Prince Gortschakoff seems to have pleased everybody, and is described as a most amiable and agreeable person. Count Walewski, who has arrived in Paris, is said to have been particularly taken with hiu. The Emperor is expected at Ohalons camp at 6 this evening. It is not known exactly when the Empress is to arrive there. Apartments have been prepared for her at the Prefecture at Chalons. It is reported that a great military and religious ceremony is to take place at the camp, during which she will present the Imperial Prince to the regimenta of the Guard. There appears to be no doubt that the duration of the camp will be prolonged to the 1 5th of October. The question of the union of Wallachia and Moldavia, upon which such floods of ink have been wasted, and the decision of which may yet be remote, is treated to-day by the Constitutio7nd in an aricle which has much the appearance of proceeding from an official source. The tenour of this article is entirely In favour of the complete union of the Principalities under a foreIgn prince, which is asserteed to be the only union understood and desired by the Moldo-Wallachians. As to a mere administrative and military union, a union of ohurch, finances, tariff, and army, the semi-official journal scouts it as a mockery. Some such project, known as " the Clarendon project," has indeed, according to the Constitutionnel, been whispered atVienna and Frankfort, but the enlightened electors of Jassy and Galatz, who bave just returned a Unionist Divan, and the equaUy enlightened WaUachians, who by this time have probably done the same, know not of it. What they understand and desire, and what the Constitutiounel to-day advocates, is the establishment of Rouman nationality. It seems to be forgotten that more than half of the existing Roumans dwell elsewhere than in Wallachia and Moldavia, and are to be sought In Turkish, Russian, and chiefly in Austrian provinces. Judging from the tone of the French journalist, however, it would be no cause of grief to him,or to those who inspire him, if the dominions of Austria were to be lopped for the benefit of the new kingdom of Rloumania. Indeed, the most remarkable feature of the article, which is of little value in an argumentative point of view, Is the bostility it breathes towards Austria. One is tempted to ask if the spleen displayed is roused by the coming interview at Weimar, or if it is solely to be attributed to vindictive reminiscences of Austria's conduct during the late war, and to acts unfriendly to the house of Bonaparte committed early in the century. It is chiefly on account of this splrit of hostility that the article obtains notice, for, as for the question of the union, it has been argued too often for one to feel inclined to re-open It on such a provocation as the Constitutionln affords. As far as England goes, it has been repeated again and again, and must be evident to everybody, that she has no interest in the matter that is not identical with the interests of Europe. The Constitutionnel, which we must presume well informed, seems convinced that the British Government has espoused the views of France with respect to the union. If this be the ease, it Is doubtless because it has been considered that the matter was not sufficiently important to differ about, the majority of the parties to the treaty of Paris being in favour of this pet combination of the aspiring patriots of Moldo-Wallachia. The question must, of course, be settled in conformity to the treaty, but it seems impossible to convince French journaliss that a mere majority in the Divans is not to decide It. Supposing the Divans to have voted the union, the European Commissioners to have reported favourably to it, the Paris congress to have decreed it; supposall preliminary difficulties-some of which, and especially the choice of a ruler for the new kingdom, are anything but trifling-to be overcome; still, all that can be said of the union of Moldavia and Walachia under a foreign prince is, that it is a hazardous experii ant the success of which is extremely doubtful, tried with the fraction of a nation of which the higher classes are thoroughly comrpted and the lower orders profoundly ignorant and degraded. Austria has, doubtless, mere reasons than any other Power for opposing the project, and beyond this fact It is difficult to discover a single motive France can have for upholding it. The bitter anti-Austrian aniinus of the CoustitutionnePs article is unmistakeable, and, as if to leave no possible doubt of it, it gives in the same sheet a letter purporting to come from Vienna and to be written by an Austrian, in which the difficult position of Austria, " which brings to mind the complications of 1848," and her complete isolation are deplored, as the unforeseen and bitter fruits of the treaty of the lth of December; all the sacrifices made to preserve the stadus quo in the Principalities are pronounced to have been in vain, and to have served in fact only to destroy Austrian preponderance in the countries traversed by the Danube, while the attitude of England is declared to be decidedly favourable to the union, so perseveringly pursued by France, and now seemingly on the eve of realization. This letter, superior in style to what is usually found in the French lithographic sheet, in which it originally appeared, is open to the suspicion of Parisianfabrication. "WVith the exception of the Ottoman Porte," it piteously concludes, * No Power testifies sympathy with our policy, and yet we were wont to consider ourselves as the arbiters of Europe! AR these considerations are doubtless maturely weighed In the conferences between Count Buol and our envoys to the three principal European Courts." As before said, one can but conjecture the causes of all this rancour towards Austria displayed by an organ of the French Govermnent. One is puzzled to inderstand its object or to what it can possibly lead. EHardly to war, as has once or trice been rumoured within the last two months. France has no valid cause of quarrel with Austria, and assuredly a contest engaged in from a mere feeling of animosity on the part of the Government would be anything but approved by the French nation. Although Austria certainly played an ungraceful part during the late war, and got soundly abused for it at the time, yet, when we look back and consider the circumstances of her position, it is difficult to see how she could have acted otherwise than she did. The most the allies could expect her to do was not to assist Russia, which so lately had assisted her. As to reminiscences more than 40 years old, of Austria turning against the husband of one of her own arch-duchesses, I douibt very much if France be disposed to expend blood and treasure in revenging such antiquated grievances. The days are gone by for wars of sotuernir. WVould not the Constitutionnel then, which is believed to reflect in its articles the sentiments of this Government, do well to abstain from such spitefiul demonstrations as that of to-day, and to remember that it is, to say the least, undignified to bark when there is no intention of biting ? It is said to-day that the Sultan, believing the union of the Danubian Principalities inevitable, is disposed to accept it, provided that the choice of a foreign prince, made by the European Powers, shall be submitted to his approval-in short, that he should have a veto, which would doubtless be a mere formality, tantamount to a recognition of his supremacy. The latest accounts from Constantinople speak of a secret intrigue, which was on the point of succeeding, for sending Redschid Pasha as ambassador to Paris in the place of his son, now filling that post. The plot appears to have failed, and Ethem Pasha, formerly Minister of Foreign Affairs, is spoken of as the favourite candidate. M. Rouet, Consul and Chai,cellier of the French Embassy at Constantinople, has arrived in Paris on leave of absence. He brought despatches from M. de Thouvenel, who, it is said, requests that, after the arrangement of pending difliculties, he may be removed to some other post. This last statement certainly requires, confirmation. Threre are one or two Paris newspapers so hostile to England that they are always ready to sacrifce truth and common sense to prove anything to her disadvantage. Thus the Unin to-day, speak of Havelock's glorious operations, writes as follows " E[o has had several affairs with the enemy acoording to ihe offimc note; he has invariably beaten lum; he has taken many guns frem him; nevertheless, he has been obliged to retire to Cawupore I We do not tmderstad. 'To conquer is to advanco,'J said Frederick the Great, certainly a connoisseur in such matters." The Union is not generaly remarkable for the brilliancy of its perceptions, but we may still suppose that, with a little goodwill, it might have mustered sufficient intelligence to perceive that when a General's forces, originaUy only 2,000 men, are reduced,as a natural consequence of campaigning and of the victories referred to, to the strength of a single battalion, it may be necessary to retire in order to avoid annihilation by a contest with an enemy 20 times as numerous. A ship of war has been launched at Bordeaux for Russia; others are expected from the United States I am assured that Rusr,ia is making great haste to get screws fitted to all her sailing men-of-war. It is reported thab the Be de la RWunion, formerly fle)Bourbon, is to resume the name of Ile Bonaparte, which it bore under the first Empire. The Customs' receipts for the month of August and for the first eight months of the present year have just been published. The following are the principal particulars:- *' The Import duties for August have amounted to 14,383,444f,, being an augmentation of 768,310f. over tho corresponding month of 1856, but a diminution of 3,204,386f. as compared with that of 1855. The principal articles pre. senting tho augmentatfon are cattle, coffee, oil, wool, cast. ings, copper, foreign sugar, and indigo; but there has been a diminution In linseed, tallow, lead, zinc, raw slk, and French colonial sugar. The imports of the first eight months of 1857 present an augmentation of 12,620,476f. over the same period of 1856, and a diminution of 12,051,209f. over 1855. But it Is not improbable that the difference between 1857 and 1855 may disappear almost entirely by the end of December, for In 1355 the extraordinary movement caused by the Universal Exhbition stopped short at the month of October, and the produce of the last three months of that year was less than In preceding years. On the contrary, In 1857 there has been a general dead season during tho summer, and it Is only lately that business has resumed its activity, which will, very probably, continue to thG end of the year. The amount of the exports during the month of August shows an augmentation over both 1856 nd 1855, partcularly in Paris articles, porcelain, perfumery, refined sugar, cotton, linen, and woollenwoven goods, wine and brandy, silk goods; and glas. The abundance of the harvest has diminshed the importation of corn, which is dolwn during lsb maonth for 349,301 metrIcal quintals only, to 692,316 qulutals in 1856; whereas the exports have been 170,198 quintals in August, 1857, to ,71,753 in the same month of 1856. The movement of the precious metals has been very active during the last month, there having entered into France 347,402 hectogrammes of silver, which, at the rate of 20f. the hectogramme, repres sent a capital of 6,948,040., and there having been exported 2,343,290 hectogrammes, of a value of 46,864,600f. But, on the other hand, the Imports of gold have amounted to 153,899 hectogrammes, which, at the rate of 300f. the hectogramme, represents a value of 46,169,700f.; the exports have been 17,532 hectogrammes, of a value of 5,259,600f. From these figures it results that the imports of the two metals together represent a total value of 53,117,740f.; and the exports one of 52,124,000f., being a surplus of 993,540f. in favour of the general circulation of the precious metals in France. Similar is the result for the general movement during the first eight months of the year, the imports having boen-silver, 61,490,920f.; gold, 375,865,500f.; ln all, 437,356,420f.; and the exportsilver, 319,290,440f.; gold, 79,231,200f. in all, 1398,521,640f., wlhich shows that during the eight months the metallic circulation has increased in France 38,834,780f."

The Opinione of this morning announced that the decree for the dissolution of the Sardinian Parliament would be published in the course of to-day, but this prediction has not been fulfilled, and it appears, on inquiry, that although the decree in ready for the Royal signature, it is not likely to be I promulgated just yet, and that the elections will not take place before November next. In the meanwhile all politicalparties are exertingthemselves to prepare for the coming struggle, and the organs of the clergy are especially remarkable for their indefatigable industry in trying to raise antipathy towards the supporters of the present GEovernment, To this end the Armonia is nowlIn the course of publishing a list of the members of the present Chamber of Deputies, with annotations of its own on their votes on the four following Bills, for the guidance of those electors who look to the Armn70nu for instruction as to the exercise of their franchise. TheBills that the A roni0waselects asthetests oE fitness or unfitness f or reelection are those on " Civil Marriage ;" " Modification of Penal Law" (which makes priests answerable to the civil power for any expressions on temporal affairs made use of by them in their capacity of spiritual teachers) ; the lawr for the suppression of certain convents; and the law which has extended the Conscription Act to all citizens until their 25th year in cases of national emergency. The votes of members on the first three of the above-named Bills the Anrmc'bia considers as proof of whether they are Catholics or anti-Catholics; and, of cour'se, it is quite unnecessary to add how it thinks they should be treated by the electors whose suifrages they solicit. The fourth measure appears only to have been included in the list by way of bringing hna few more names for rejection, and evincing the great jealousy of the retrograde party f or the freedom of the citizens, To the same effect, also, the Gatt'olico of Genoa continues a series of violent appeals to the municipalism and impatience of taxation of the Ligurian electors, and it thus concluded one of its tirades the jother day *-" Once more, electors ! if this race of men continues to hold its foot on our neck, nothing remains for us but to emigrate. We won't say 'Go,' becaiise about five years makeit possible to remove the nuisance. Another five years, and the difficulty will be altogether done away with." Another five years will hardly suffice to convince the Cattolico party that their efforts to overthrow the Constitution of this country are vain, it is to be feared, although, to judge from present appearances, there is every prospect of their finding themselves at the end of that time much in the same position as they are at this day; but if the Cattolico were really to advise its clients to cut their sticks ("far fagotto," as it says itself,) from this State, aceursed with laws which make priests and laymen equally amenable to the civil power, it would certainly add much to its popularity with the inhabitants at large. Several English gentlemen and clergymen con nected with the Foreign Aid Society have arrived in Turin lately, with the object of endeavouring to establish a chaplai here of the church of England. I have not heard whether their charitable intentions are likely to be successful, but I should fear not, as the British residents in this town may be counted on one's fingers, and they are probably content to avail themselves of the Valdese church rather than pay what would fall upon them as a very heavy tax for a pastor and place of worship, for of course at least half the eaixy of a chaplain would have to be found by those who were to benefit by his services, With the exception of the members of the British Legation there are not habitually a dozen English residents in Turin, and of those few there are two or three members of the Scotch kirk, and as maniy more Disaenters from the church of England of one kind or other. Just now the hotels in Turin are crowded with English tourists, and the Anglo-Saxon is predoininant under the porticoes of the Subalpine capital, but that is a very tranmient state of things. A few weeks hence all these autumn travellers will have betaken themzelves to winter quarters in the South or in the North, and were there an English chaplain here then he would probably find himself with an ordinary congregation of half-adozen. A subscription has been opened here for the purpose of erecting a monument in Turin to the memory of Daniele Menin.

She had also cut out her signature to the wil of 1850. One of the sisters mentioned in the wiIl had died before, and the other had survived the testatrix. Dr. SPINrs now moved the Court to grant probate of the vill of 1850, on the ground that the testamentary paper of 1854 had been written by the testatrix, in Ignorance of the law, merely for the purpose of declaring her intention as to the disposition of her property In the event of her surviving her sisters, and not animo revocandi. The learned JUDGE said that the cutting out of the signs. ture to a willprlm4 facle amounted to cancellation although circumstances might be lad before the Court to sLow that it wasnot done aninmo cancedandi. In this case, however no such circumstances had been lald before the Court, and it was unreasonable to ask the Court, upon an ez parte argu. ment, to preclude other parties who might be interested frombeing heard.

AfIDDLB,SEX kIgSION4 Thursday, Oct. L (Before Mir. CREAsY.) John Rooney, 30, optclian, was indicted for fraudulently obtaining by false pretences from Ann Toker a sovereign, with intent to defraud. Mr. Sletgh appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Payne and Mr. Metealfe were counsel for the prisoner. The ProweontrlL-I am the wile of John Toker a retired odicer, and live at 18, Cambrldgstreet, Pimlico. Mr. Glover, who was returned as member for Beverley, s my nephew, I believe. One day-Saturdav, tho 15th of August, I think-the prisoner called at ourihouse and said he was one of the electors of Beverley, and gave the name of Arkwright. He wvas showrn into the drawing-room, and he then said he had come up fromBeverley withhis father,who, however, had returned, leaving him without money. Ilis father he saSd, would telegraph to him that night, and he shoula then have money. He aked me to lend him a sovereign, and I did so upon the faith of his representation that he was an elector of Beverley. He then went away, and afterwards I found that he was not an elector of Beverlev and ave information to the poliee. I did not see him agaIn untif the 18th of September, wlhen I met him in Ecelestonstreet. I told him where I lived, and asked him If he was not the man who obtained a sovereign from me. He said, "No." I asked him if he had ever been at Beverley, and he said he had never heard of such a place. I then gave him in charge. When at our house he said he and his father were two of Mr. Glover's stanchest supporters. There Is no such name as Arkwright upon the list of voters for Beverley. A witness was then examined who proved that the prisoner's name ws Rooney, and the servant at Mr. Tokers stated that the prisoner was the man who said he was an elector of Beverley. She let him in and heard him say so. Mr. PArNx addressed the jury and contended that the prisoner's Identity was not sufficiently proved, and that the statemeat he ws sad to have made did not in law amount to a false pretence. If there had been an elector at Beverley named krkwright, and the prisoner had represented that he was that person, the case would have been very different. If the prisoner really was the man he had told a lie simply. Mrl Toker lent him a sovereign goodnaturedly, pleased no doubt at being the aunt of a member of Parliament,-though he was not long the representative of Beverley,-and if everybody who told a story and derived advantage from It was to be tried judges and juries would have notMg else to do. Mr. Cs.ASY said, the ouly substantial question was as to the man's identity. If the prisoner wras the man, the faets made out the offence of obtaining money by false pretences. Tho jury found the prisoner Guilty. Mr. SLEIGH, on behalf of the prosecutrix, strongly recommended him to mercy on account of his wife and children. Mr. CREASY sentenced him to sidx weeks' hard labour. Wiliam Conch, 36 William Clark, 25, Charles Wornum, 26, and Joseph urwell, 22, were indicted for stealing 13 carpets, value 80M, the property of Thomas Pestorre, in his dwellinghouse. This robbery was committed on the I9th of Augi in a most impudent manner. The prosecutor lived at 47, Glocester-place, Hyde Park, and it appeared that the prisoner Wornum was related to one of the servants, and was at the house on the 18th. The cazpets had been taken up for the purpose of being sent to be cleaned, and were lymng packed up in the back dining room. It would seem that he arranged a plan with the other prisoners to carry them off. On the following eveninv Couch and Clark drove a horse and cart to the door, and told the servant that they had came forthe carpets for Mr Sewell, the cleaner who had received orders from Mrs. Pesterre to fetch them. The servant let them have the carpets, which were put into the cart, and the prisoners left. As they were not returned by the time they were required inquiries were made, and it was found that they had not reached Sewell's premises, and, information being given to the police, Clark and Couch were traced and apprehended by Inspector Checkley, of the B division. The carpets were pawned, and disposed of by the four prisoners jointly. They were preduced in court. The jury found Conch and Clark CsWi1f of stealing, Burswvell and Wornum Guily of receiving. They were all know n to the police, and one was stated to be a ticket-ofleave man. Judgment deferred until next sessions. Mir. T. Atkinson prosecuted; M&r. Payne, Mr. Metoalfe, Mr. Sleigh, and Mr. Longford were engaged for the defence. Richard Evans, 26, was indicted for stealing a silver basket and other articles of plate, value 651. l6s., the property of John Fowler, his master. Mr. Metcalfe appeared for the prosecution, Mr. Sleigh for the prisoner. The prisoner was butler and confidential servant to Mr. J. Fowler, civil engineer, of No. 2, Queen's-square-place, Westminster, at a salary of 501. a-year, with perquisites and board and lodging. About the end of July inquiries were made of him concerning the plate, somaething having transpired about it, and after some hesitation he said it was not forthcoming; he had pawned it to put himself in possession of some ready money. He said he would borrow some money to redeem it, bnt he did not, and was ultimately given into custody. He bad pledged the articles in the name of Bellamy, they being marked with the initial " B," which was the first letter of Mrs. Fowler's maiden name. The prisoner was taken into custody at his mother's house in Newland-street, Pimlico. le had been led into dishonesty through betting, and a book containing entries of bets was tound upon him. The jury returned a verdict of GuiUy. Judgment deferrd u ntil next sessions. John Metcalfe, 35, was indicted for embezzling the sum of 19s. 6d., the moneys of Robert Baker, his master. Mr. Metoalfe appeared for the prosecution, Mr. Sleigh for the prisoner. The prosecutor was an upholsterer, having two shops, one in Edgware-road, and one in Church-street. The prisoner had the care of one of them, and the charge against him was that he sold a bedstead and mattress, pocketed the money, and told bin master that he had sold nothing. The prisoner received a very good character, and Mr. SLJEUIG contended that there was no case made out against him. He was AcquWctd. Rose Raoul, 40, aFrenchwoman, was indicted forkeeping a brothel. mNr. Metcalf e, instructed ry Mr. Randall, appeared for the prosecution. This was one of a series of prosecutions instituted by the authorties of Marylebone against the keepers ofmbrothels inNorton-street.

POLICE. ;MANssoN-.HoUB.-JOhn Franklin and William Kerp, who had been remanded upon the charge of having u:tered up to him and asked him to take au order for a forged check for 270l., with intent to defraud the Union Joint Stock-Bank, were again brought before the LoRD MAYOR. Mr. A. J. Johnston, the barister, attended in support of thc prosecution; Mr. Lewns, jun., appeared for Franlin; and lMr. Humphreys for Kerp. Mr. Goodman having read the depositions taken at the former examination Mr. Johnston aid, -I propose to-da to call some fresh evi. dence with regard to thecae already lAid before your Lordshli against the prisoner Franklin, and also to prefer a fresh chae of forgery. He forged an order for the delivery of A check book under the circumstances to whIch I will advert. It Will appear, from the evidence of a boy named Enmm, the son of respectable parents, living in the city, that he being in tho neighbourhood of Finsbury. squre on Friday lht, the day previous to the uttering of this forged check, saw a person whom he will distinctly identify as the prisoner Franklin, who came a check book to the Union Bank of London, to get the check-book and bring it back to bim. The ld will tell you tbat he ccordingly took the order in ques. tion to thebank. and received a check book; that hetook back that check book and delivered It to Franklin, who Rave hbm a shilling, and told him that if he came to the game place on the foowing day at 12 o'clock he might have another job for him. The lad went there, and after waiting some time and not seeing the prisoner left. I sball also show that the forged check which was presented was taken from the check book to which I have referred. With regad to Kerp, I confess at first sight, if I were not Lble to lay more evidence before you the evidence as it stands would be weak though V sidcour Haydon, the of5icer has stated that when he Asked Franklin how he became posessed of the check, he merely gave an aecount of his having got it from a person at the Three Colts Tavern, where he was to receive some money on bets. The prisoner Eerp has refused *tether to give his address I am further informed that I shall be able to prove, although not to-day, that the cabman who was with Kerp at the cab stand saw him and Franklin together previous to the utter. lng of the check. I now ask for a further rerand M1r. Humphreys said. that no evidence had been addnoed at All Affecting Kerp. It was true thiat he had refused togive his address, nd he had a perfect right to do Eo. The only circurnstance of Any suspicion against him depended on the uncorroborated statement of kr nklin which he (Mr. Hnmphre7ys submitted was not sufficient to justify the de. tention of erp The Lonn MAYOR.-If a mnan says he is respectable And refuses to give his address it looks rather strange. Mr. Humphreys.-The very circumstnce of his being a respectable man maybe a strong reason for his refuz to give it. The Lord Mayor, I apprehend, will never commit a man on a serious charge iike that of forgery without there being A moral certainty of a conviction. Mr. Johnston.-No address has been given to the officer. Mr. Humphreys. --And none will be. The LorBD MAYC P-Is the cabman here? Mr. Johnston.-No. The LORD MAYOP-I have not sufficient evidence as the cabman is not here, to justify me in remanding Eerp again, but I have sufficient to justify me in calling upon him to enter Into his recognizanoes Mr. HUmphreys.-He will enter Into his recognirances, but he wi not giTe his address. fr. JOhnstoI.-Then he ought to fnnd sureties. Mr. Humphbe s--Sureties for what? Mr. Lesw-47 shall show hereafter by the most unmistakable evidence that Franklinj has been a dupe in the other prisoner's hands. The LORD h&YOsR.-If Kerp refuses to give his name and addreu I shal remand the case tillo od°ay. Remanded Accordingly. WOSHIP -STRExr.-George Edwards, a journeyman In the service of Mr. Foresbury, a meat palesman in Leadenhall market, was charged with the following atrocious assault upon Ann Collins, the wife of an officer in the H division of police, The complainant 'who exhibited severe contusions of the face And ras evidently in extreme suffering, stated faintl, tnat the defendant was a relative of her husband and hAd recently manifested much ill-feeling towards them; this induced her to refuse him admission to her house, but he persisted in annoying her, and last evening on her opening the street door he seized her by the hair with his left hand, dragged her across the threshold, and struck her repeatedly with his clenched fist on the head and bodv; from these blows she bled at the mouth and left ear prozely,-desfness ensued, and her ewes were blackened; mndependent of which results of a more delicate nature had followed-she being at the time three mouths eein-e. A certificate from a medical gentleman named Edmunds minutely described the injuries indicted on the poor woman, Collins 49 H then stated that while engaged at the rear of the premises preparing for his duties at the Btation screaMs of murder from his wife in the street induced him to rush to her assistance. Fortunately his staff was within reach as he passed along the easwe, and he was obliged to use it freely on the head of er assailant, his own cousin, before he could release her from his tenacious grasp and cowardly violence. The defendant, whose head was swathed in bandage$, now assured the magistrate that what the good lady had spoken was utterly false-he had not touched her;* but Mr. H I was disbelieving, and said he should remand the accused for a week, as the consequences might be more serious than even nowv deecribed. SOUTHWARam-James Fricker, a respectable-looking young snn, was brought before Mr. BRCHAM for final examination, charged with robbing his master, Mr. Thomas Steele, slk merchant and draper, Blackman-street, Southwark. Mr. Solomon appeared for the accused. It appeared that the prisoner had only been In the prosecutor's employ nine days, who hbving some suspicion on Saturday Aout him went into his bedroom, and, seeinv a box there, he lifted up the lid, and tbere perceived seve pleces of riband, gloves, and other articles belonging to hlm. He closed the box, and communicated with the police, when Sergeant Raymond, X division, returned And mook the Prisoner Into custody. Mr. Solomon, on behalf of the prisoner, pleaded "GuIlty" to the charge, stating that it was the first time he had committed himself. His friends were highly respectable, and he had held good situations and maintained, up to the present time, an excellent character. Mr. BURCA asked the prosecutor whether he had a character with him? The prosecutor replied that he had, and he was surprised at his robbing him, as his engagement was 456l a-year with board and lodging. He must, in fact, havecommenced robbing him the first day. Mr. Solomon hoped his worship would deal leniently with him, as it was hIs frst offence. Sergeant Raymond said, that on searching him he found a betting-book, in which several recent entriles had been made. The prisoner expressed his contrition, and acknowledged that he had made some bets, and unfortunately had been the loser. Mr. BURCRAM told hirn he had committed a very serious offence, for which there was not the least excuse, and if the prosecutor had wished he should have sent him to the sessions for trial. However, as he had pleaded " Guilty;" and having been asked to deal summarily with him, under the recentAct of Parliament, heshould inflictthe severestpunishment on him allowed by law. He sentenced him to dx morths' hard labour in the House of Correction at Wandsworth.

IRELAND. (PROM OU'R OWS CORRESPONDENTr. DUtLEN, Ocr. IL (GREAT !'LO()IS IN COicK. The Cork papers received this morning statc tati on Tuesday a strong gale blew from the !wuhs-r.ar, and towards evening rain fell in torre,uts, and so continned durivg the greater part of the, night. Towards the west the rain meast liave beges earlier5 az on Weduesday morning the river was swollen ts a hulge e:xtent, and was rushing through -he toin | with the ragidity of a t4rrent, bemriLLg et-iJenee3 of its rage in broken; trees, spars, aced ether. sreek. t. p aiong the banLks of the river we mir2er.stand very serious dae.mage hasfl beenl done. Stacks of hty fromn the neadows and of corni from the stubble-fields have been carried otf by th:: Hlow of the water, aud in mrny places the sulrface has been mnaterta'fy injured. At l3.undors there wvas a serious inmmdation, by which e great deal of damage t-, property has been dono. The iicod did nlot tak e place i-u the mnain river, which ruwns throtgh the town, buit in a small branch called tie Shanagool, which overflowed its banks this motning, bulrst open a small bridge by which it is spannled, asd ricsehed down through the South Main-street with such force fnat several shop fronts iu that locality were torn asray. A second editioni of last nights i7l;r4 .-qi,eim,contains the followving particulars of the el'ect of the floods in Bandon and tie ueighbourhood " very serious calamity fsas befallen the town of Bandon, involving considerable destruction of property and the loss of a sinele life. Durins, the whole of the evening of yesterday and tbrough the night the rain fell in such torrents that between 2 and 3 o'olock this morning a small stresm, which comes down from the moUntainons Cashel district, by Mayfield, and thence into the sonth sidc of Bandon, became swollen beyond its usual dimensions. The little bridge near the old chapel wvas inadequate to afford a passage for the immense body of water, which, in consequence, overflowed and rushed through the streets of the rown, first flooding the distiDery of Mr. Fitzgerald and the brewery of Messrs. HArley. which are in the neighbourhood. The force of the water soon became so great that it demolished a sniall bridge caUed Cavendf-h tBuay Eridge, which in its fall considerably damaged the house and tanyard of Mr. Lee, situated close by its abut. ment. Its destruction, however, involved a much more melancholy result, as there is but too much reason to suppose that a poor man, a watchman, named Thomas Eel y, wvho has since beer, missing, was on the bridge nt the n.oment of its fall, and was engulfed in the runsIng water. The poor felow's dog was afterwards discovered rnanning about the spot, and vainly barking after hilost mast,.r. A little bridge, which crosses the stream just at its junction with the maln river, and leads into the P'res. byterian nmeeting-house, was also destroyed, but wibbout any such melancholy accompantiment. Damaee of another kind and to a very serious extent was also inl!icted after a different fashion upon the town. The little angry river nrns through a back street parallel to, and at the rear of the South Mairn-street. The confined water ruthing through the back of the houses eicap:d through the fronts, c3rrying off with it in n!:my instances the whole of the shot) windows, doon, kc. Among the chief sutfferers w_as Mr. William Bullen, the whole of the front of whose shop was swept away. Curiously enough, a box coIntainling money, It is said to the amount ,f 2d1/., was sent floating about, but was recovered by Head-Constable W right. Mr. Beamish, dyer, suffered in a similar mtanner, a large juwtantity of Indigo used In his mansfactures lending to tho water that deluged the neighbourhood an azure tint at his expense. Amoig the other parties injured were 'Mtr. 'Bennett Hayes, r. Xtochc, dir. Crowvley, MIr. Moriarty, and a large anumber thlat I cnnnot enumnerate. As may be supposed, great alarm was felt, but a large party of police under the command of Head-Constable Vright, was soon on the spot and using every exert'.n to save property and liCe. Mr. flesery HaEsett, J,P., who was also Dre.ent, bv hispru-sence of mind ard energy gave much valuable assistance. A body hass been found at C'olliers's-cquay, and though not yet identified is supposed to be that of the unfortunate watchmann. The damac that has been done is not, I regret to ar, confined to the town, ro less than three other bridges 'haviug been destroyed, one at Ballyminahane, one at Ballin2curra (near Bandon), and another at a place called Doundaniel. An immensity of damage has been done to tho matlcoach-rnad, the parapet wall of the little river bring carried away in many parts, and the road in some portions so cut up that it is scarcely an exaggerat'on to may it seems torn up by an earthqliake. Of course It isas yet impossible to form anything like a correct money estimiate of the damr-ie done, but undoubtedly it will be found to be very large. The river Bandon ic still greatly swollen, and rashes along by the railway In tremendous volume, flooding the mes dows at each side, bht no further Injury Is anticipated. Tho extent to wvhich tho inundation has reached has becomue very serious. Eight acres of oats belonging to Mr. Townsend, of Woodside, were completely swept away. At d fferent tlmes during the day a cow, a pig, a donkey, a butt, aud various other hoary articles, Proving the enor. menus force of th flood, have leen seen l!oating dow-n tie river. The body ef a woman, too, has been found, batt not yet identified. It is supposed she avas surprised fly the flood, and drowned. As yet we have not been able to ascertain any further particulars, but we have learnt enough to lead us to believe that the late rains have produced far greater damage tbroughout this locality than we at first anticiputod." ln Limeorick also the heavy rains of Ttesday di,l considerable damau!e. The timber scalfoldintg at the Castleconnell lRailwvay was swept away, and some injiry vwas done to the Rtobertstown v iaduct oie the Foyrnes linte. TlE 31AG IST5:ACY. MTr.

There wern iv,wre than 4,000 persona proeuen, a, wooden building, co,. erlag, 2,949 square yards, having beeni erected foc the rccssion, decorated with coloure-d calico, and brilliantly ~llunainated. Air. T. WNrigley, the chairmanx of Mr. -Philips's eilection commnittee, presided ; amd there were also on the platform Admirrl Sir Charles Napier, M.P., AIgr. J. A. T'urnier, MI.P., Air. .1. Cheethanm, i P., Mr. G4. Hadfield, AI.t., MUr. J. P'illcingion, M.P., Mr. Ml. Philips, Dr. Ml Horrow, and Sir J. Watts, of Manchester. Loiters of apology for absence were reacd from Lord Goderich, Mi.,P Mr. Roebuck, Ml.P., Mr. WN. Browm,U.P., the Honn. IF. H. F. Berkeley, Al.P.' Lord Duncan, M.P., Mr. W. J1. Fox, andI Mr. G. Wilson. The C;1ATRMAN1,T said the responisibility of calling together this vast assembly had not been assumned. in order to gratify any idle taste, or ininister to the vanity oi any individual cliclue or p arty, but because there was a great ino-al purpose anid political object in view. They were as- sembled to do honour to the constttuency in the,prsqon of Itheir valued representative (cheers), and to celebrate the "I'triump of a principle of wvheih Mr. PhUiis was the type. (Ch eers) A constituency miight have a representative of brlliant abilities, with the wit of Fox and the eloquence of D)emosthenes, butt unless he had also the yluality of honest thotrut cnfiedto him was no longer tenable ; and inMr Philips this borough had a represents- ive of no ordinary abilties, and also one on whoin his constituents ojuld pre. eminently rely that he would never deceive them. (Cheera.) The chairaman then proposed in succession, the toasts of "1The Queen," 'The Prince Consort, andI the reat of the Royal Fainily," and IIThe Army and Navy," which were enthuaiastically received. Sir CHARLES NTAPzER rose to responad to the last toast, amid hearty, cheering. He said,-Mr. Chair. man, ladies, and gentleman, I have attendedI many large mieetings both in the metropolis and in other parts of this reat country, but I don't think I ever met an assenblyv so large and so orderly as the one I am now addressing. Such a meeting as this does honou-r to yourselves, as well as to -your hon. representa. tie hm I am happy to call mry friend. (Ap. pluse.)I can assure you I feel very highly flatteredi at the manner in which you have thought proper to receive me. I am hut a humable indlividual of the profession, and I meet you here in the interior of England, where hardly the name of a. sailor is known, and where he Is very rarely Laen. (" Hear, hear," andl lauighter.) I thank youi, therefore, fromi the very bottom of mny heart for this kind recep. tion. I have performed no service at all which demands it from you. During the war wvith Russia it was not In my power, nor was it In the power of the British nav,t perform any great service to this country. (Hear hear.) The enemy with whom we had to deal refuised to come out and meet us (loud cheers), and they were much too strong for mae to be &ble to oanidmeetthemn. (Hear, hear.) I know that some people in England have fancied, or pretended to fancy, that they k-now better than I, hut, gentlemien, I am an old practitioner in the navy. (" Hear, hear," and laughter.) I knew what mien and what ships could do; and. Though I and they were ready to sacrifice our lives for the safety and honour of ouir couurry, we had not couirage suffcient to lose the britibh fleet. (Cheers, and " Bravo.") It would he ve-ry bad tr.s9tt in inc to say any more of my own wrongs at a metting of this sort, buzt I do wishb those who wronged me were present here. (Hlear, beer.) How their heart&'would. shrink to see the meetinIg that lisa receivedl me onl this koccasion. (flear, hear.) No man ever endeavoured to got :ustice more thian I did. I applied for eourte-moartial n fw cxaminations; but the Government were afraid of being exiosedl, for they refuised to allow the Investigation I dt ansuded. (Clieers.) On the very first occasion, - ~.iad It offered itself very soon in the muttropohlis 'm thi reat% country-when a vacancy occurred In Parlia iuent, I peale to the people of England, and they returned me by ,, must triumiphiant majority as one of their repre-ent'a. tives. That showed th~e feeling they had for me and their dissatisfaction at the manner in which I bad been treated. (Ilear, hxear.) IHaving said so much, gentlemen, Iloan only regret that the navy in the present war will not have an opprtoisyof ffodin th?t service to their crountry thoit theyothewis woud b gladl to render. The unfortunate rebelli''on nw go?in`g1 on. in Indlia calls niore for military than for Laval Operations ; but I trust every exertion this great counLtry can miake will be made in order to put down the mnutiny, and to avenge, and severely avenge, the injuriesand cruelties that have been inflicted on our countrymen in the East. (Hear, hear.) I don't wish to lmeayGovernment at all, hut I think Governments for many years past have been very much to blame respect. ingInia They were warnedl, and often warned, by officers wIhoe knew the condition of the Indian army and of our Government In India ; and!they were mor-e particularly warned by a gallant relative of'mine, now no mnore. (le-ar, hear.) He said to them, "Take care of India, take care of our army there, rulec It better, and officer it better, or te day will come, and it is not far distant, when there will be a muLtiny and a rebellion in that country." (Hear, hear.) All that he said was negleced,, or despised, and he was hinuself pulled down and illtreated by the Governmient whoma he recommended to be more careful in their conduct. But I will not blamve one Governmnent more than another. These warnings were given to all Governments, -whether Whig or Tory, ancl thcy were neglectedI and despised. The thimig for us to do nowy is, niot to reoriminate, but to do all we possibly can to repair the miublhef. Let by-genes be by-gones, and let us all, of every denomuination, whether Wlsiig, Tory, or Radical, put our shoulders to the wlieel, nan endeavour to send reinforcements to that country, an-I save our fellow-countrymen, and particularly the wonmen anid children. (Cheers.) In the first inistance, wo were not sufficientlyvactive in sending troops to India. It appears-by a paper I .have hero that our first troops sailed only on the Ist of July, while the news of the mutiny arrived on the 28th of Miay. I tLink there was great blame, hut the blame was not to the (Joverumenut, but to yourselves. You cried out anid inFi~'ed upon the Government doing away with theineomne-tax, and the (Jovornient was obilged in consequence to make great reductionisin our.armyanidour navy. They were tak.-m by surprise in India when the mutiny took place, and we bad no,,t ships in England of aby description to send ouir troops cut In. I can cay, for myself, I used all mDy exKertions to convirce the Houseof Commons of the absolute necessity of this great country keeping up establishments for all contingencies (hear, hear), but we were tired of the incomne. tax, and I dare say we had reason to be so. (Hear, hear.) N-evertheless, this couLntry ought never to he left without a prolper defence both naval and military. Wbat have we gaind? You got rid of thee id, and I bcelieve you will have Is. to pay in future. (Laughter.) Don't you lay the flattering unction to your souls that this rebellion is to be put dowrn so easily, I have not the sumallest doubt It willhe putdown, but you must pay for doing it. (Hear.) It is all very well to say the East India Comapany most pay ;bat I tell you the East India Company is.Englandl in this case, and if the East India Company cannot pay the bill John Buill must pay it. (Hear, bear.) It was the people of England, and you here as much as ammvbody else, Iwho were to blame, and I am niot afraid to tell you so. ("Hiear, hear," and laughter.) You insisted onl reductionis. I went myself to Lord Palinmerton, and said, "M by Lord, if you wil stand up in this Housec and say you will not be responsible for this country unless a proper army and navy arc kept up, you may depend upon it you will receive the cheers of the country from one end to the otber :" and I am sure that wouild haEve been the c-ase ; ut Lordl Palnierston, like other Ministers, was afratid of losing his place. (Laughter.) I dare say other Ministers have done the same, but I sini sorry the reduction took- place. I remeraber, in 1827, when Spain mnarelbed an army into Portugal during the Adnuiinistration of Mr. Caann!ng, whlen we- kept up a navy in England of aE, illany sril of the line ; Mr. Canning came down to tve House of Commons soid said :-"I We received the news the day before yesterday of Spain invading Portugal. A Cabinet CouncOil Was held that day ; the Pslnce Regetaits opini..,n was taken on the followinig day, and at the tinie I am addrcssing von we have 10,000 men in full march to Portugal.' (Hoear, Lear.) Now, if you had niot insisted on the army anid navy being reduced, I have iso hesitation in saving thai in 48 hours you would have been able to send iO,000 or 15,00) aen oat to India, JTust reflect on what horrors that woiild have saved. You wouild have prevented the horrible mnassacre at Cawnpore,and the threateningof Lucknow at the present moment, where tlierearel 0.00English,!men, women, and children, locked up, short of provisions, with few to defend them, and an army of barbarous rebels besieging them. I wish to God I could take all this assembly here to Lucknow, witli even only bluidgeons on their shoulders, and we wouild save all those unfortunate creaturies from being mnurdered. (Chieers.) Massacred they will he, unless indeedt the officer in command there has decision and determrintuion sufficient. He is In an awvful position. These wouien and children have only the choice of being violated and murdered, and treated in the mnoat barbarous manner in the event of the rebels succeediiig in takinig the place ; and the Govern,or has absolutely nothing to do to iayo them froim this ignomniny and cruelty but to destroy the whole of Luck. now. That, ladies, inay appear to you a horrible thingbut whar can be done? We have seen what bat; been done at Cawupore, and when we reflect on whsat must be done at Lucimow, if no relief has taken place, there is nothiing on eartci left bUt for the n.an in com~mand with h.,s _o_wn hands to destroy his fellow-countrymen, worueui, and children. It is a horrible thought, an awful thing to think of, that with our own hands we must apply the match to destroy our women and children to rescue them from the horrid barbarities that were practised at Cav,n pore, and will be practised again at Lucknow if the rebels succeed. But I will say, if the Government were rathier slow ill beginning. I myself and other members of the House of Commons did all we could to urge them to sena troops out with mere vigour than they vwere using yet after they had once begun they have gone on with the greatest en.ergy possible. Seventy-seven transports have now sailed; :;5,000 rnen are gone, and 4,0(0 or 1,000 more are ready to embark the momient we have the means of sending them, But it will take three months before they can arive in India. lW'hen they have arrived, therecannot be the smallest doubt that the rebellion will be put down; and I hope the cause of the murdered will be most severely avepged, T am not of a barbarouts nature myself, bat I know no punishment that can yossibly be inllicted on those wretches that will be suiffcient. atting them to death is nothing-It is almost mercy ; but though I would save their women and chUdren, not one other human being should live there if we had tbe power of putting them to death. I am sure there Is not one, not even the most kind and most religious in the world, that for one moment would be mealy-mouthed enougfir to say that one of then, should be saved. (Here, hear.) TV"e horrors of which we have read in the newspa ers have never been equalled in any country in the world ; and I I do hope we shaU go on pourng troops into India. But even if you put down the rebellion, there is a great deal to be done before you can organize an army sufficient to restore our power in that unfortunateand unhappycountry. I call It unhappy and unfortunate because even theinhabitants themselvesnmust sufferdegradation andinfamyfrom the conduct of theirsoldiers. We have not yet done enough, in my opinion forIndia. TWehavecalled out onlylO,000 of the Militia, We u.st call out the whole of the Mhilitia of Great Britain and -Ireland; aDt we must sende:ve maIt who can carry arms go IndLa as fast 4s we can. 'We must give up China alto. tether, ttis a flea-bite in compasison with India, and we can secTtle that any tlme at oar leisure. (" Hear," and la" i.ster.) Let us pour treops into India as fast as we can, an I do trust, tsoughWocaanot expectitby the noxt mafi, that every suemssive mail will bring newvs of the arrival o'f fresh reinforcements in ali parts of India, to prevent further mnssacres taking place. (Elear, hear.) I cannot express to you smy gratitude for the exertions the Govern aent are at last making. We have a Minister at the head of the Government, in Lord Palmerston, who, I am happy to say, I am glad to think we must look upon as a nost energetic Minister. Neither years nor anything el-e bave any et',ect upon him, I believe. He is a good deal older than I am, and God knows I am old enough (laughter), hut I beleve that man is a fit man to be the Minister of this country, and if he is well supported, as I think he ;s, by his assistants and colleagues, he will be able to bring this war to a successful termnation. (EHear, hear.) Now, gentlemen, though that can be done, I am not exactly of opinion that we ought to give up reform. (Hear.) I think reform can go on at the same time that we a:e sending out troops to India. It requires only a stroke of the pen from the Ministerto orderso many thousand men to go there, and while they are performing the voyage I do hope and trust the country will keep Lord Palmerston to his promise to give us reform. I don't know to what extent of reform you go in Bury (laughter); I go tolerably far myself; but I will tell you there is one species of reform we are all asking for. I want to see the constituencies reform the,nselves by sending their members to Parlianient free of expense ; and you may depend upon it, if you wish to got good members of Parliament you must send them there without half ruining them. Some that you send there, the fust thing they think of is to gel places to mlake up for their losses. (Laughter.) You laugh at that, but it is very true; and other gentlemen are obliged to frllow a course of economy-and I am one of those who do it--to recover the expenses my election has cost me. I don't know how your member has got off here. (A voice, " Free," and cheera). Well, then, I need not talk to you ; youarereformed; youahavereformedyourzelves; but let . lother constituencies of England do the same, andl de. pend upon it they will send a very different ciass of members to Parlament from what they do at present. Remember how many men there are in this constituency, how miany in h,anchester, and in various other towns and counties, far fitter to represent you than these yon send to Parliament now, hut they are kept hack because they car not afford it. By reformingw yourselves you may rely upon it you will get the services of members more eficient, and who will not hunt for places as your representatives are doing at the present moment. (Cheer-. ) The CHIAURLA, in a long address, proposed " The Health of Mr. P. N. Philips." The toast was received vith great cheering. Mr. lt. N. PHIIirPS, MsLP., having expressed his acknow. Irdgments, referred to some of the incider.ts of his eketion. He then rermarked that, with respect to the labours of the pact session of Parliament, he believed there never was a House of Commons which had more freely granted to the Governmenit of the day all needful supplies. He had voted in favour of the large grants that had been given to the Government for the support of the army and navy and the civI service; and it was now the business of the executivo Government properly to adninister those grants. There had been many measures brought forward by the Government, which were of considerable inmortance to the well-being of a commercial community. To the Attormey-General they were deeply indebted for Bills relating to law reforms, and more particularly for one with respect to the better regulation of wills and the administration of the property of deceased persona. That m easure was more particularly under the gui(dance of the hon. member for Sheffield, with whom he agreed in thinking that it would work well for the country. Another measure of importance was the Divorce Bill, the object of which ivas to give to the poor the advantages wh!ih were previously only enjoyed by the rich. He supported that Bill, and also that clause whieh was introdisced in order to provide local courts. The question of divorce itself was another matter; this Bill simply removed a distinction which had hitherto existed between one class and another. (Hear, hear.) The vote which he believed was most inter. eating to his constituents was npon the ballot. As he had promised, he gave the measure his support, and he regretted that it had not met with bettersiccess. He wished that those who opposed it would show some other plan by which the object in view might be attained. (Hear, hear.) Every man who had the franchise should have the privilege of usilng t in the way he thought best. (Hear, hear.) EHe considered it degrading to a man to have to go round a borough canvassing the electors. The electors should be allowed to sce the candidates, to make their selection, and if they did not like any of thern to abstain from: voting altogether. In the next session the House would have to consider most seriocsly our colonial and internel affairs. He ha.d made up his mind how he should act with regard to India; he should give his most eordial support to the Government, in order to enable them to obtain everything necessary to put down the rebellion. (Hear, hear, and applause.) It was nonsense to begin yet to talk of what ought to be done in the government of India until the country was again our own. He would not detail the cruelties which had been inl.icted there, but be world remnark that in Manchester a subscription had been commenced in order to assist the suifferers, and he hoped that every one in the country would contribute his or her mIto to the fund. The rebellion being put down, it would be the dutyof everymemberof theLegislatureto give to the Indian ouestion his seriouscon6ideration. They must ask what, were the evils which bad eauscd this mutiny, and if possible, remedy them. He thought that a powerful executive Govornmi,ent underthe Crown was necessary, and 'hatfor the aduinistration of its internal affairs there should be a good commercial head appointed, who would make such progressive irprovements in the interfor of the country as would develope its resources and benefit India as well as the mother country. Re rejoiced at Ihc auticipation that in the discussion upon Indian affairs the couatry would have the advaurage of the presence in the House of Commons of the hon. member for Br.cksngham--Mr. Bright. (" Hear, hear," and app'ause.) That gentleman's opinions upon Indiawould be r.e.ved with great deforence. Much would have to be dc.en in the cultivation of cotton in India (hear, hear), a subject in connexion with wh;ch great exertions had been made by the hon. niember for 'South Lancashire, Mr. Cheetham, in order to obtain certain privileges from the Ea.st Indla Comrlpany. (Hear, bear.)) 'ith regard to the ruestion of the reform of the House of Commons, he hoped that the LobleViseount at the headof the Governmentwould see that the timne had arrived when a Reform BiU was again necessary. Therehadbeenuianysocial changesin the country since the last was passed, and put an end to the rotten borough system; a new Bitl was wanted to extend the franchise among the industrious worlking classes. If, however, Lord Palmerston should not think proper to bring forward any Reform BiW, there was another noble lord-he referred to Lord John Russell-who might think it was time for soinethingto be done. (Hear.) Under any circumstances, whoever brought forward a good substsntial measure of reform shonld have hlis sincere and hearty support. (" Hear, hear," and applause.) One great advantage of bringing forward a Refcrm Bill just now would be, that Its introdustion wouldnet be the result of elamour; it was not desirable that legislation should be postponed until it must take place under pressure. He had now only to thank his constituents again. There were few members of the House of Comnaons wbo could say,as he could, that he had been returned free of expense, and that when a petition was lodged against hin his return was defended by their own subscriptions. He owed them a dee) debt of gratitude for the manly way in which they had a ways supported him, and he hoped that they would always equally value their own independence and liberty. (fear, hear.) He had to propose " The health of Mr. J. A. Turner, M.P., and succens to the commercial interests of LancashXire." (Hear, hear.) At the lst election he (Mr. Philips) was in the unpleasant position of an opponent to the houn. gentleman who had now come to support him. hlo (Mr. 1'hilips), however, acted at that time eutirely from conscientious motives. He thought lie was doing v.hat war right and proper, and what would be beneficial for the country. It was the 'irst time that either in Public or private life he had had a difference with the man whom lie loved most dearly. The result of the election at Manchester was to place Air.Turner and his colleague at the head of the poll, and his (Mr. Turner's) presence among them that evening showed that, although there was a difference of opmnion in Manchester on certain points relating to the wvr, yet there was no difference as to the great questions of reformu. (Hear.) There v-as not a split, and there shonld not be a split in the Liberal literest in the city of Man. chester; it would always remain united in support of thcse principles for which Manchester was so weLl known. ("Hear, er,"andfapplause.) The country was much indebted to Mr. Turner for the pains he lad taken during the last session in the management of th1e savings-bank question; more recently Mr. Turner had placed the people, especiaUy of this district, under a deep obligation to him for his labours in connexion with the question of a supply of cotton. (Hear, hear.) 'J'hough he (Mr. Philips) might have differed from Mr. Turner on some points, yet such a man ought to he much esteemned, as indeed he was,by those who had sent him to Parliamnent. As far as he (Mr. Philips) had had to do with political life, he did lnot know that on any division, except, lporhaps, upon an unimportant matter, he and Mr. Turner liad been found in different lobbies. He had therefore g. eat pleasure in proposing his health. (Cheers.) I Thhe ineeting Wu subsequently addres sed by - .M r..A i Tu'nerl. and other gentlemen, aud the proceedings conclulded about midnight.

THE MURDER AT BRMALL. The murder of James Hendersn, farmer, at Bramall, Cheshire, at an early hour on Wednesday morning, when he was shot dead while asleep in bed, has created the most intense Interest throughout the neighbourhood, and great numbers of people hawve aready visited the scene of the tragical occurrence. In the account given in The Tire of yeaterday several mysterious circumstances,inconsistent with the story told by James Henderson, the eldest son, of the house having been entered by burglars were briefly glanced at. The arrest of this son, who is 3+ years of age, on his return from Manchester, after the despatch of our report, on Wednesday evening, by Mr. Andrews, chief superintendent of the Cheshire county police, on suspicion of having murdered his father, removes the necessity of withholding these and other details attending the murder which it was then thought desirable to keep back. It would be gathered from that report that on Tuesday night 11 persons went to bed at Hardy's farm, including-the deceased in one bedroom; the prisoner in a bedroom adjoining his father's, on the left hand as approached from the staircase; and mrs. Henderson, deceased's wife, and a married daughter, Jessie, in a bedroom on the same floor, to the right of the deceased's. There are three bedrooms over the groundfloor apartments In the front of the house. Another daughter, Jane, slept in a smaU room on the same floor, but looking to the back of the house. The doors of all these rooms open into a short' passage, only a few yards in length, at the top of a staircase, of two flights of six steps each. At the bottom of the upper sx steps is a landing where the stairs turn, lighted by a square windowl glazed with small dia mond.shaped panes of glaos Eet in lead. In one of two attics, ascended from the passage thus described by two other fights of six steps, slept the other son, Thomas Henderson, and a servant man and a servant boy. In this room was alsoasheepdo: The otheratticwasoccupiedby a servant voman. TwoIrish lads, outdoor farm servants, slept in a granary enteredfromthefarmyard by a flightof stone steps. These members of the household retired to their chambers at various hours on the Tuesday evening. Thomas Hen. derson, who had been to get bis shoes mended, returned home and went to bed about 10 o'clock, when he found that his father had aLready retired, his usual practice being to go t o bed between 8 and 9 o'clock. The servants, male and f emale, had also retired. His mother, who had arrived late from Manchester, where she had been with horse and cart, driven by a man-servant, to fetch grains to feed cattle with, went to bed soon afterwards with her daughter. James, the eldest son, who had returned from his employment as cashier of Messrs. Sanders, Son, and Co., cornfxctors, Manc-hestertern miles distant. about T o'clock, was the last to =etire to bed, and is supposed to have been up antil 12 o'clock. His story is, that he was awoke at 2 o'clock by hearing the discharge of a pistol in his father's bedroom. He knew it was a pistol shot, because he could distinguish the sound of a pistol shot from that of a gun. He got out of bed and laid holdof adoublebarrelled gun, and then opened his bedroom door, and, seeing somewhat indistinctly a tall man near the window at the bottom of the first flight of six steps of the staircase, he fired at him. The charge was one of smaaU round sbot (about o. ), and went partly through the right-hand corner pane of gLass at the top of the window, and partly against the plester wall by the side of the window. He says the man screamed and wook to flight, and tbat then a light he had seen in his father's room wvas exfnguished, and two or three men rushed from that bedroom, and made their escape down the StairS, in front of his own bedroom door. A cry of " robbers !" was then raised by other members of the family, his brother joined him, and they went down stairs; but the burglars had escaped, and they afterwards found that their father had been shot dead, and that the door of a sitting room down stairs had been opened, a leathern writing-case torn open,'and 141. IOs. abstracted. The table drawer in the father'x bedroom containing 1001., a banker's receipt for 931. lOs., aud a watch had not been disturbed. The first thina in all these particulars, when first related to the pollce, which excited remark, was that out of so numerous a household James l3enderson alone should have seen anything of the murderers. Several members of the family speak of hearing a shuffling of fee. on the staircase, as if some pe-sons had ruin down it, buts the noise was not as If they had shoes on, o rrlf they had, as if something was wrapped over the solesto deaden thesound. Theprisonerstates that it was usual to keep a loaded double-barreled gun in his room after the annual cattle sales, when money might be supposed to be in the house, and yet it would appear that one of thc outer doors bad been left unfastened-no appearanoe of a forcible entry beiig anywhere perceptible-or that such carelessness had Leen observed during the previous evening as to enable some of the murderers to conceal themselves in the house. Another point which naturally excited attention was, that the prisoner, at the time he kept a loaded gun in his Vtdroom to guard against robbers, should have left bis leathern writing-case, from which he says the burglars bave abstracted 141. lOs. of his money, upon the table of the sitting-room, the door of which was left unfastened. Then it must be supposed that the dog heard no strange footsteps about the house, or he would have gven some alarm. These are all ciroamstances compatible iita the prisoner'S innocence, but they have no doubt had some weight with the poliee in putting him under restraint. But there are other circumstances which are of far greater importance, and which had naturally much weight in deciding the course to be taken. One of these is, that the lsmall round shot extracted from the head of deceased on a post mortem examination are of about the same size and description as those found in the plastsr of the wall, fired from the prisoner's gun. The papers used as wadding in both discbarges were also not only found to correspond with each other, but with paper found in the prisoner's dressing-table drawer. For iastance, in the dressing-table have been found four pages of l a 12mo. cheap publication, headed The ColvUjc Girt, or tMe Afarriage Day, forming a sizth part of a sheet of demy tsi elves. The first of these pages are numbered 1, 18X and 1, 186, and the other two are pages 1,199 and 1,200. On cxasrimmg the wadding paper found on the bed of the murdertd man one scrap is found among it forming the corner of page 1,I1S of the same publication. The type is the sams and there is enough letter-press onl the scrap lo identify it as part of the same tale which occupies page 1,199. Then the wadding of the gun-charge which took effect on the side of the window of the staircase, and which is said to have been fired by the prisoner at the murderers, is In the hands of the pollee, and is easily identified as part of the samus publication of the same tale. These facts were in possession of the polle on Wednesday evening, when the prisoner, who had been to Maanchester that day (after the murder), returned home, and Mr. Superintendent Andrews, after consulting Captain Smith, chief constable of the county police force, and Mr. Little, deputy constable, at once decided on taking him into custody. Mr. Andrews told him,, on doing so, that he was charged with the mnurder of his father, and he replied " Indeed ! on what grounds ?" Mr. Andrews told him there were very strong grounds of suspicion against him, and that it would be necessary that he should be detained in custody unti the facts were more fully investigated. He made no attempt at resistance, and was soon afterwards conveyed to the county lockups at Stockport, where he is stiAl confined. Yesterday morning the prisoner was brought privately before Colonel Davenport, a magistrate of the county of Chester, at the lockups, and was remanded until Tuesday next. The inquest on the body of the father was also opened yesterday evening, but too late for a report to reach forthis day's publicatior. It was understood, however, to be the intention of Mr. Johnson, the coroner, to swear in a jury, open the proceedings, and allow them to view tble body before interment, after which he would adjourn the inquest to next Tuesday. '['here is a good deal of speculation in the neighbourhood as to what could have formed the motive for such an uanatural murder, supposing the suspicions against the prisoner to be well founded; but on this poinit very little has transpired, except that there had been ageodideal of hosillty between the father and son owing to the latterhr ving attempted to get Colonel Davenport, the landlord, to transfer the farms from the father to him, and bis constaut interference with the management of it.
PREaERVATION OF5 LIFR FROM SfPH WIECK.-Yesterday a meeting of the loyal National Lifeboat Instibiition was held at its house, John-street, Adelphi ; Captaiu Lainbert Perrott in the chair. Mr. Lewis, the secretsry, having read the minutes of the previous nieering, a reward of 61. was voted to the crew of the lifeboat of the institution stationed at Berwick, which had been Instrumental iu assisting two herring-boats with crews of nine rnen, froni a perilous position when overtaken by a heavy north-east tale very early in the morning of the 2d ult. Had it not een for the assistance rendered by the lifeboat, both boats and their crews would in all probab:lity have been lost. The si!ver medal of the institution and a copy of its vote on velum were presented to Captain Tulor, PN., in acknowledgment of his gallant conduct in putting off with others in the Wick lifeboat during a heavy gale of wind and attempting to rescue the crew of a Hanoverian galliot which was on the !):h nlt. observed to be in a dangerous position rear WVick, and to have her crew in the rigging. The crew of the lifeboat have, we understand, been rewarded elsewhere. Ln. mense seas swept over the vessel froue stem to stern. Through the tremendous surf the lifeboat with her gallantt crew had nearly suoceeded In reaching the ship when a heavy sea separated her froim the vessel, driving her up the hay, the bilows growing in volume and rolling into the boat with an almost unprecedented rapidity of succession, breaking aU her oars and drowning one of her noble crew. 'We fear that none of the crew had lifebelts on, and probably the poor fellow who 1perished, and was afterwards found to have had only ore hand, lost his life through the omission. We again repea=, that people in charge of lifeboats on the coast incar a fearful resopnslbility ifthey allow their crews to go afloat in them without each man having a lifebelt on. A reward of 11. was also given to the master of a barge for his laudable services in saving three sergeants of the Royal Marine Artillery, who were capsized frern a boat near Southsea somne time since, when three of their comrades unfortunately perished on the occasion. A reward of 3Z. was also voted to three pilots f.,r rescning, at much rigk of life, 17 persons from a pleasure boat, which was seenin a dangerous position at the mouth of the Severn, in the British Channel, on the 24th nlt. A reward of 1L was also voted to two Irish fishermen, in consideration of their promipt conduct in putting off in a curragh (a smaU canvas boatl and rescing three men who had been capsized from their boat off Munstark Island, on the coast of Mayo. A set of lifebelts snmilar to those in use by the crews of the lifeboats of the society were ordered to be presenkdon behalf of the institution to the crews of theiMargate lifeboats. Miss Bnrdett Coutts, with her uisual liberality, had given the men a lifeboat, and the other boat they are themselves about to purchate, aided by the contribut-ions of the public. The officers of the institution had by invitatikrn vislted the Boulogne Shipwreck Soeiety, and reported thai its lifeboats and life-prerg apparatus were in excellent order, and that they redected much credit on the committee tif management, which consists of Frencb and English gentler men. It w7as reported that during the past month the institution kad sent two lifeboats to Wieklow and to Cambe, n-ear Rye. During the last few months the society has found. d, at an expense of nearly 2, 0001., five lifeboat stations on the west and on the soith-east coast of Ireland. The committeeearnestly appealed to the public for snp port to enable them to ineet the heavy demands made o the fuinds of the instita:ion, Tie proceedings then closed,
