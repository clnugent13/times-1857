The line was formed at 10 o'cock, and ,hortly afterwards Colonel Tulloch, attended by a mounted orderly, rode on the grou nd, and was received with a general salute, drama and fifes playing. Having inspected the line, the ranks closed, broko into open column, and marched past. They then commenced a complete round of field-day manwuvres, and went through a series of manual and platoon exercises. Finally, Sir Alexander, dismounting and passing down the line, examined the personal appear. snce of each man, inquiring the ages of those who appeared to be most advanced in years, and desired that if any of them had any complaints they would make them known to him. None, however, were made. Having formed square the colonel advanced to the centre, and assured them that he felt great satisfaction in meeting them again after the lapse of six months as complete a corps as when he last inspected them, with the exception of three on sick leave and one absentee. After paying a compliment to Colonel Forbes and Major Warde, the colonel retired from the common amid cheers. The Agamemnon, Master-Commander Cornelius T. A.

AZOTERB COLLIBRY EXPLOS&OA. ABERTILIRY, MONMOUTERSMRE. TH1TJRMMAV A wtkole district is again panic-stricken by a fatal colliery explosion, and 12 lives have falleu victims to that terrible element-firedamp. At about 7 o'clock yesterday morning a cloud of smoke was suddenly observed ascending from the Tyr Nicholas Pit. Jobn Carpenter, an overman, wvho was on the surface, saw the indication of an explosion, and immediately descended. About 80 men, we understand, were at work underground, but the workings were divided into two separate portions. Carpenter discovered resons for apprehending that the explosion had taken placo in the " five-feet vein." He caUed men from the other working, and with much bravery proceeded in search of the living and the dead. Amid much danger arising fsom the " chokedamp," and being obliged to supply canvass doors for those blown away in the air courses, Carpenter and his companions undauntedly proceeded, and at length came suddenly upon the bodies of eight poor feUows, who had been struck down at a moment's warning by the terrible " choke," and hurried into eternity. 13xtendiog their search, they presently found the bodies of two men and two boys. Three had met their death by burning. The fireman, Samuel Merrifield, whose duty it was to precede his feUow-workmen to ascertain the state of the pit as to gas, had also fallen a victim. The dead bodies were got out as soon as possible, and the distressing spectacles witnessed at the pit's mouth as each was recognized by children, or brothers, or widow, were most affecting to behold. The managing officials of the coUiery lent every aid to t o survivors who were inured, three of whom were said to hein a dangerous condition. One poor feUlow, named Henry Clarke, is said to have become delirious, although physicaUly uninured from the shock received by him ia the pit by the explosion, in which lamentable state he yet remainsB. The cause of this sad catastrophe it is almost impossible correctly to ascertain. There are many rumours in circulation, WnlCh it would be unjust to repeat. A conjecture has been hasarded that as Merrifield, the fireman, was found in the spot where the explosion must have taken place, with bis Davy lamp lying near him, the top separated from the bottom, he must have been " trying for gas " with the naked light, and hence the explsion. The following are the names and ages of the killed William Williams, aged 42; Samuel hlerrifield, 29 ; Jonas Brown, 52; John Silcox, 30; John Havvkins, 51; William Wyatt, 58; Thomas Barwell, 18; John Jones, 13; Thomas Parry, 53; George Taylor, 58; James Gregory, 23; and Charles Merrifield, 58. Orders for coffins were immediately despatched to Mr. John Palmer, undertaker, Newport, and the poor feUows are to be interred on Saturday or Sunday.

uN! VRR&TY. INTZ'LTrGBNCZ. OXFORD. MAY 29. A meeting wIll be held on Tuesdaynext in the Sheldonian Theatro (which has been lent for the purpose by the curators), under the presidency of the Bishop of Oxford, in order to establish and inaugurate a new Eociety, to be called The Oxford Diocesan Spiritual Aid Society, the main object of which will be to afford assistance in the maintenance of a curate to the most necesnitous clergy of the diocess. It is understood that the vsit of the two University Members to Oxford during the Whitsun recess is specially connected with this meeting, in the business of which they vwil take an active part, together with many other influential yersons from the three countie rhich form the diocess of Oxford. The meeting will commence at 1 o'clock, when the whole theatre, with the exception of a portion of the semi-circle, reserved for the speakers and their immediate friends, will bo open to the public. A large attendance is expected. The following is a more exact abstract of the new statute on the subject of middle-class education than our space permitted us to give yesterday:- " The preamble recites the fact of numerous applications having been made to the 'University to bring into connexion with it by a system of examinations classes of persons beyond its bounds engaged in the studies of a liberal character. " Clause 1 enacts that two examinations of such persons shall be held annually, either in Oxford or elsewhere, as may seem expedient,-. one of older students between the ages of 15 and 18; the other, of younger students, 'who have not completed their 15th year. " Clause 2 fixes the subjects of examination, which are (I) the Rudiments of Religion for those persons whose a arents or guardians do not object; (2) English Literature; (3) History; (4) Languages; (5) Mlathematics; and (6) batural Science. '- Clause 3 enacts that 'Tostamu' shall be given at both examinations to all who satisfy the examiners; and that the title of Associate in Arts shall be conferred on those who obtain h. Testamur' in tho senior examination. ' Clause 4 provides for the appointment of a delegacy to tominate the examiners, and to fix the time and character if the examinations, the number of the classes, &o. The delegacy proposed consists of 21 momoer,-viz., the ViceChancellor, the prectors, six persona named bytheHebdomadal Council from their owvn body, six persona elected by congregation, and six nominated by the Viee-CbnacefloT nri proctors. The delegacy in to bs appointed for tbree " Clausa 5 gives the delegates the puwi- If -quir' 7 from the candidates a scale of fees sufCe4Icnt v', ratin expenses of the examin.ations. Clause 6 impeses on the delevs;- z ' w dut'. ;.-king an annual report to the University." The statute is arcompenied by tL', aport of a committee of the council appointed to consider the subject, consisting of tho Vice-Chb.cellor, the Provost of Worcester, the Easters of Pembroke and Balliol, the Principals of Brasenose and Magdalen Hall, Professors Pusey and Daubeny, Mr. Michell, Mr. Gordon, and Mr. Mansel. This report is followed by a number of documents, chiefly memorials from places of importance in favour of such a scheme as that proposed. The most important are two from Birmingham,-one from the Educational Association, the other signed by 81 of the most influential inhabitants; one from Cheltenham, with 46 signatures; one from Glocester; one from Leeds, signed by the trustees and masters of the Grammar School, and by many clergy of Leeds and of the neighbourhoad; one from the Hants and Wilts Education Society; one from the Warwick and Leamington Schoolmasters' Association ; and one from the Examination Committee of the West of England Prize Scheme. These memorials are preceded by two letters from the Rev. F. Temple to the Master of Pembroke, suggestive in all the main points of the Echeme to be proposed to Congregation. The Reader in Experimental Philosophy (Mr. Walker) preposes to commence a course of lectures on Magnetism and Electrodynamics, at the Clsendon, on Wfednesday, June the 3d, at 1 o'clock. Those gentlemen vvho wish to attend are requested to enter their names at the lecture-room on Tuesday, June the 2d, between the hours of 1 and 2 o'clock, or before the first lecture. A. fee of 1. is fixed by statute to be paid for the firat time of attendance, but this fee once paid entitles to free admission to any number of courses afterwards.
13Ls-op or ABmwaennr.-The Rev. Dr. Thomas G. Suther, incurabent of St. Andrew's, Aberdeen, has been elected a Bishop in room of the late Bishop Skinner by a majority of the clergy of the diocess, thirteen voting for Dr. Suther and nine for the Rev. Patrick Cheyne. The new Bishop belongs to the Evangelical party. INCOiwORATED CHURCH BunILDInG Socrxry.- The 39th annual general court of this society was held yesterday at '9, Pall-mall. His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury took the chair. The attendance of members was very limited in number. The Rev. G. Ainslie, secretary, read the report, which stated' that in the course of last year assistance had been granted towards the building of 30 new churches, the enlargement and rebuilding of 20 churches, and the repairing and rendering more available for public worship of 69 churches, at an aggregate expense of 13,0321. The increased accommodation amounted to 23,120 seats, 21,688 of which were reserved for tbe use of the poorer classes, incuding schools. Thecommittee haddischarged in the course of the year claims to the amount of 13,0491., by means of which 26 new churches had been completed, 2a rebuilt, and G3 enlarged. The committee were still responsible for 31,3331. for grants promissed in aid of churches in the course of erection or repair. In the course of the past year the functions of Her Majesty's Commissioners for Building New Churches had ceased, and their powers had been transferred to the Ecclesiastical Com. missioners of England. The committee expressed their regret at the cessation of the " Royal Letters," by which a sum of 8,000l. was on the average annually produced. The pastoral letters of the bishops had also been very inadequatelyresponded to, stIll they hoped those pastoral continue to be issued, as they were convinced that there were some who would always be ready to promote the glory of God and the good of their fallowcreatures by the erection and reparation of churches and chapels. The funds placed at the disposal of the com. mittee during the last year were.-donations, 762X. 14s.; subscriptions, 1,269l. i diocesan and district associations, 1,2351. 5s. 7d.; collections under episcopal letters, 2,1071. 4s. Wd.; legacies, 2,8951. 15s. 6d. Mr. Beresford Hope, in moving thAt the report be printed and circulated, expressed in very feeling terms his regrat at the loss the society had sustained by the death of their late secretary, the Rev. Thomas Bowdler. In his opinion, the society had not received that support which was adequate to its great claims; in one respect, however, this was not a matter of much regret because he believed that the diocesan focieties had gained that which the parent society had lost. He was sorry to see so small a gathering of memberc on the present occasion. What they were to do to remedy it' was matter for future and deliberate reflection. The resolution being seconded by the Rev. H. Etowarth was unanimously agreed to. A vote of thanks to the vice-presidents and the church architects was then proposed by the Rev. Canon Wordsworth, who observed that the diocesan societies ought to regard themselves as owing a sort of filial duty towards the parent society, and he trusted that a cordial co-operation would ever exist between those societies and the parent institution. He also hoped that the laity would unite their efforts with the clergy in promo. ting the objects of the society. Considering that upwards of 500,0001. passed into the hands of the churchwardens every year in the shape of church-rates, it was impossible that those persons who had the fabrics of the chturches especially under their care could fail in their duty, and allow the society to languish and decay for want of adequate s pport. The resolution was seconded by the Rev. Saamuel Smith, of Cambsrwell, and agreed to. Mr. Cotton (Bank director), in moving a vote of thanks to the diocesan, district, and parochial associations for their exertions in aiding the object of thissociety, said that he very mnuchattributed the non-attendance at religious worship of large masses of the poorer classes to the pew system which so extensively prevailed. Hle was happy to observe, however, that the attention both of the clergy and of the laity was being directed to this evil, and that means were now about to be taken to bring our poorer brethren intomore direct communication with the excellent Liturgy of the Church. He, however, could never expect a blessing on their labours until the offering of the people was made to God, and not bestowed merely as a gratuity to the poor. In shozt, his anxious desire was to see the offertory restored. The resolution was seconded by Mr. Arthur Powell, and unanimously adopted. A vote of thanks was then proposed by Mr. B. Hope to his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, as president of the society, for his unremitting attention to its affairs, as well as for his kindness in attending the meeting that day. Mr. Hope trusted they might often see his Grace occupying the position he then held, and that he would he better supported by his right rev. and rev. brethren than he had been on the present occasion. The vote having been unanimously adopted, his Grace, in returning his acknowledgments, said he did not think any other society, useful as they undoubtedly were, more immediately concerned the interests of the church than the one they were then assembled to promote. Great complaints were mado that the peo lI would not attend their church, but they could not be expected to unless the necessary accommodation was afforded them. It was impossible that the working classes should find places in the existing churches, and what was the consequence 7 From a disuse of attending public worship they at last lostall desire to do so. However there was hope that this disinclination would soon be overcome. He had been informedthatthree weeks ago, in the parish of Islington, week-day services were held esDeciaUlyfor the working classes and it was particularly desired that those who had seats in the churches should on those services stay away. What was the result ? The churches were crowded, and on the following Sunday evening there was not a single church in the parish that was not filled to overflowig. Therefore, he would say, it wvas a vital question with all the true fiendg of the cburch that they should by every possible means afford church accommodation to the people; and when they were able to show to the rich that the poor were anxious to come to church wherever there were churches built for them it was bis firm belief that the most ample support would be given to this society. The benediction was then pronounced and the m eeting broke up. METROPOLIS TURNPIRE ROADS.-The 31st report of the Commissioners of the Metropolis Turnpike Roads was published yesterday. The tolls of the several districts submitted to public competition were let and produced within 101. the same sum as they had realized the previous year. The receipts from tolls during the past year have amounted to 56,3W., and the receipts from all sources, to *62,5351., the concurrent ex>penditure having reached 61.878L, being an excess of 23431 bceyond the income. AII.the tradesmen's bills and other liabilities of the commisdoners to the Ist of February last have been paid, and, the estimated amount of their present floating debt is about 8,0001.

LEEDS. Mr. J. .L Miles addressed a meeting of the electors at the Stock-Exchange on Thursday evening. Aldermon George presided, and, after paying a tribute of respect to the deceased member (Mr. X Hall), warmly commended Mr. Mills to the support of the electors. Mr. Mills briefly explained his political views, the chief of which were set forth in his printed address, an extract from which appeared in 27te Times of yesterday. He had been supported by upvwards of 2,000 of the electors at the late election, and a.lthough then unsuccossful, he hoped he should be returnea at the forthcoming one. At the conclusion of Mr. Millss address, Mr. W. B. Holdsaworth moved a vote of confidence in Mr. Mills, pledging the meeting to support him. The motion was seconded by Mr. Adams, and carried. Mr. W. E. Forster, the other Liberal candi?date was to. address the electors at the btock-Exchange yesterAay (Friday) evening. His leading supporters Eay that he will gR to the poll, and that many of the Liberals who supported Mr. *MilUs at the Last election will now support Mr. Forster. No Conservative candidate has yet been announced. .A lrman Sidney, of London, who in his absence was put 'a numination along with Mr. Ball at the election for Leeds in 1852, has issued an address to the electors, intimating his willigneEs to become a candidate.
MEDICAli BEFOBlf. Yesterday alternoon an influential deputation of the "Heads of Houses" of the medical profession had an interview with Sir George Grey at the Home-offlce. The deputation consisted of Dr. Mayo, President of the College of Physicians, London; Dr. Alderson, Treasurer of the College, Dr. Hawkins, Registrar, Dr.Burrowes, Member of the Council, and Senior Physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital; Mr. Travers, President, and Mr. Joseph Henry Greene, and Mr. Stanley, Vice-Presidents of the College of Surgeons, England; Dr. Williams, Dablin, Pxesident of the College of Surgeons, Ireland; Dr. Nergon, Menior censor of the King and Qieen's College f Physicians, Ireland; Dr. Hunter, President of the Faculty of Pvhysicians of Glasgow; Dr. Wood, President of the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh; Mlr. Tegrt, Chaisnan of the Court of Examiners of the Society of 4pothe¢szies, London; Mfr. De Yere of the Court of Assistants, &c. Dr. JsL&YO introduced the depuatifon, and in doing 6o said he trusted that the profession at large had arrived at such an amount of unanimity as wag possible when it was considered into how many sections they were divided, greater than had ever obtained before. They had come to support the Bil of Mr. Readlam, a BiU that had the whole profession and the public with it in its favour. He was aware that there wasanother BUl before Parliament, that of Lord Blcho, which contained a provision for the nomination of ail the members of the neW governiDg council by the Crown. Mr. Headlan's Bill, which had been adopted by the deputation, had the same provieion for six vacancies, and it was reasonable to conceive that a large portion of the council to be elected ahould belong to the medical body. Their proposed MeEical Bill far surpassed Lord Elcho's, as it would tend to improve the s&uus of the body in general, giving large opportunities to every section for that preliminary education which was so essential to every section of the profession. Sir G. GP.REY said, that it appeared to him the dissentients from Mr. Headlam's Bill and its supporters held similar viewswith respect to generalprineiples,Ibut different only on matters of details. Dr. MLkYo said, that the points of each differed, and it appeared to a great majority of the profession that those points were of vital importance. Sir G. GREY was glad to hear that the medical profession was so unaninpous now, as Dr. Mayo had stated. Ie under. stUod that the BiU bronght in by Lord Elcho was not his own Bill, but one that he had taken up from some other person mnce last session. The Hon. H. F. CowPst B said, with regard to unanimity he had waited for that opinion, and therefore he took it for granted that it wvas settled among the profesdon to sup. pert Mr. Headlam's Bil. Dr. WiLiUAsS, President of the CoUege of Surgeons, Ireland, said, that he had coire expresdy from Dablin, in company WIth his collesgue, Dr. Neligon, to express the a; proval of the bodies with which they were connected of Mr. Headlam's Bill. Ten medical corporations were unaniincus in their support of it and in condemnation of the mneasure of Lord Elcho. His Lordship'sBill confiscated the revenues of the corporations, and took the management of their affairs away altogether, vesting that power in nominees appointed by the Crown. They had 21 licensing bodies agreeing with them. The Universities of .Oxford, Cambridge, and London had not declared, but as far as they had spoken they were in favour of the Bil of the deputation. Dr.WOOD, President of the CoUegeof SurgeonsEdinburgh, and Dr. Hunter, President of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons, Glasgow, followed with arguments on the same side, saying that their respective institutions had unanimously agreed to support the BiU of Mr. Headlam as the best, and, in facb, the only Bil of the profession. Sir G. GREY, having asked some questions, thanked the gentlemen for the information they had given him, and the deputation then retired. Mr. HResdlam, MI.P., also introduced a deputation of medicel graduates, consisting of Dr. O'Connor, Dr. Maclean, Dr. Adlington, Dr. Sibhold, and another gentleman, upon the same subject. Dr. O'Co?Nsos. having fully explained their views, the depu.tation withdrew.
YOUNG ?IEN's EV32NflG CLASSES.-Yesterday evening a dinner in aid of the fund for the purchase of the lease of Crosby-hall and the permanent endowment of the evening classes for young men took place at the London Tavern. Earl Granville took the chair (though not until after the dinner had commenced, as his Lordship wts delayed by having gone by mistake to the Freemasons' Tavern), and there were also present-Viscount Ingestre, Mr. T. Baring, hXP., Mr. John Dillon, Mr. . W. Fowler, &c. The usua routine toasts having been disposed of, the noble chairman gave the toast of the evening, and recapitulated the substance of an appeal which was distributed about the room. This document stated that the evening classes for young men originated in 1848, to meet a great want of the age, bF giving healthy occupation for their leisure hours to clerks, shopmen, and artisans of the metrepelis and it has ever since continued its work with the most gratitying and progressive results. Their chief place of meeting had been at Crosby-hall, and during the nine years the classes had been held there upwards of 5,000 cer s&.ns had attended, and there were no less than 845 mem6ers in the first term of this year, of which number 161 subrosibed to the library, reading-room, and lectures, and 791 tickets were taken for 33 casses, where systemnatic instruction was given In common things and all the branches of literature. The success of the sytem as an educational institution had been certified by the fact that last Juue 22 of the members received certificates of merit at the examination before the Society of Arts, and carried off three out of the six 10-guinea prizes, while one in November at a competitive examination obtaiued a clerkship in the Educational Department of the Privy CounciL The sum re uired for the purchase of Crosby-hall was 5,500b, and a ?urther sum of 8001. to pay off existing liabilities; and there was no doubt that the clases would become self-supporting when the building was rent-free and present liabilties discharged. When once the building wes in the hands of the trustees for educationalpurpeses it would be availbble for kindred societies and ther uses much wanted in the city, such as a trade museum, a mercantile or maritime colege, or a middle school for tradesmen's sons. The Lord Mayor had kindly consented to preside at a public meeting (should one be thought necessary) to raise funds for the purchase of Crosby-place, and his Royal Highness Prince Albert proposed to head the subscription with a donation of 1001. Lhe young men were endeavouring to raise 1,0001. among themselves, and other subscriptions had been promised. It was he ped that the public would respond to the appeal, and thus render permanent a useful and approved institution, the rtsult of nine years anxious work, and so save the committee from the painful alternatie of dispersing a well-cemented band of a thousand intelligent and sef-improving youths. The toast was received with long-continued applause, and practicaUy responded to by a smost liberal subsoription, rmountins to no less a sum than 2,6761. Other toasts foll wed, ana the festivities were kept up till an advanced hour of the eveniug.

After the usanl loyal and appropriate toasts, " The Army and Itay" being represented by Yiscount Comberniert and Captai ones, The LoD MATYOR rose to propose the toast of the even. ing. It was, he said, a peculiar satisfaction to him to have the honour of seeing so many of those eminent personages wbo, with so much integrity and ability, administered the laws of the land. A good waderstanding had always existed hetween the leglaluthorities of the land and tho great city which he on that occasion represented, and he trusted that that good understanding would long continue. He begged to propoee " The Health of Her Majestrs Judges." The LoRD Cnw BARON, in returning thanks, stated that the duties of the Bench wera exercised under a control by which everything must be bound-he mneant public opinion. The judges of tho land would no more dare to swrer7o one tittle from an honest interpretation of the law than the gallant officers who had on that occasion represented the sister services would dare to show cowardice in the presence of their forces before the enemy. The conduct of the common law judges was always sablject to a cer. tain check-namely, that of a jury ;and in th courts of equity, the public pres, acting. as it always did with the utmostimprtiality, rendered it impossible for any judge, even if in¢lned-and he was sure thatno judge ever would feel inclined-to deviate a hair's breadth from strict rules of law and equity. (Applause.) The LoRD MAYOR then gave the toast of " The F, Ministers," coapling with it the name of Mr. Dali e American Minister, -Mr. DLAnS, in returning thanks for the toast, expressed the satisfaction which he felt at being allowed to render his tribute to the abiity, integy, and industry which characterizedthe e land. (Applause.1 The musical arrangements were under zhe direction of Mr. Bates, assisted by Clark [epworth, Messrs. Daw son, D)onald King, and Lawler. Alter the banquet the Lady Macress had a quadrille party, and daucing was kept up with spirit until after 1 o'clock, when the party brains up.

The following are the receipts of railways for the past week- *BOMBAY, BARODA, AND CENTRP&TL INDIA. - , The report of the direoctors of thbs company aittea tht, iu consequence of the retiremnent of two of their coUlboi (their late oble chairman and Mr. Lewis), CoIonel Prma hasbowppointec chairma, Catia Soott vioe.chaimaan and Mr. y and Mr. Hackenxie have beenappoinked berof the board, subjet to th approval of the sabrs. holders. The directors fully cocur with the oonsltng engineer in the opiniosi that their maot important duty is to obin from the home Government of India a ncion foree' thejunction line between Bombay and Surat, nd they Wa ad!pt every le"itimate meas witbin thdr ch to accomuplit thisan'tal objec, fUll- caulating un the strenuous support of the sh.areholders in sostiniugtlieir efforts. The a.rebolders at their last meeting addressed a memoria to the Governor in Council of Bom. bay, mieatig that the further informaion required by the HOD. Court onthe subject _m htbe furnlhed. An& 3sit me yhave UGovernmenm ombayb eooomplied n nrequest, 2dfafrnished sueh further informaion, it wll be now for the shareholders to conaider whether the time hus not arrived for their addrssing a memorial direct to tbe Hon. Court and the Board of Control, earnesUy solicting a favorable decison On the ese. The directors altd ntheir last report, that thyhad then under consideration the important matter h es amount of security in the registry and trnse of MhaCa and they are now happy to sue MMat. good systera or checks has been establihd in the tnsfer department; in addition to which, an arrangement hI been made with the auditors for a minute monthly audit of all the account, induding the registr and trfer records of the company. The report of IAieutenant.Colonel Kennedy, the consult. ing engineer, sates that the works are progressing on 94 miles of the line, and that the estimated cost of 142f miles of the line between Surat and Ahmedabad, ba upoa the worldng plans and sections of that porion of the undertaking, includinm the crossing of the Taptee, Nerbudda, and Mhye rivers, amnounts to 788,9031., or 5,516C. per mile, and of the roUin, stock and op tools for one train eac way dLUYto .85L,or 28Lper mile, making together 878.7081., or 6,1441.per;mile. Forevery additioa daily trn (up and down) for which it may be necessary to provide rolling stock may be estimated at about 51. per mile of line in addition. But it had been shown In former reeorts that if right 1rinciples of constrction and working the line be sthictly adherea to, one full°tr.naily ineachdietionshould l the sharebolders 10 per cent, upon their capital. tbe frei gts and fare for lowest eias coeds andpasengers being-chaged at about one-half f the English rtes. It would nowever, be unreasonable to hope thct eVen One train dail in each direction should be filed on the remote detached portion of line between Surat and Ahmedabad, until they were permitted to efrect a jmuction with the commercial focuisof their line at Bombiay To obtain this permission from the Government sppeared tobe the most important duty of the direcetors. From the answer given by the local.Govern. tneu of omba tothe urgent solicitation of the thercniebde fta r dny tappeared that the coyictiOn, of tfhe hloca Government continued as strongly in favour of opening the Bombay and Surat junction as-it ever ha& been, and that in referenoe to the memorial forarded by the shareholders at their last balf-yearly meeting, the Bombay local Government had reiterated their solicitation to the home Government for the immediate extension of the line from Surat to Bombay. There appeared, therefore, to be nothing now impeding the progress of the work in the vital point which every well informed authority a6dmitted to b-e the main element of Its ultimate utility and SUcess, but the con. currnece ofL the homne Governmnent of India in the reiterated recmmendations of the Supreme Government of India, of the local Government of Bombay, of the commercialinterests of the Bombay Presidency, of the Manchester commercial bodies, who are interested in Indian progres and of the shareholders and directors of the com any. It was therefore clear, after the fnUest oonsi. deration of the entire subject, that the most important benefit which the directors could confer upon the share. bolders of the company, and upon the population of Westerm and Central India, would be to obtain the concurrenoe of the home Government in the unanimous recommendations of the above high authorities for the immediate canstraction of te Surat and Bombay Junction. All the previous engineers reports and estimates, as regarded the practicability and cost of constracting this indispensable portion of the line, had receivedan important nMb tion the recent report, dated March 10, 1857, of Mr. Forde, the present chief engineer Of theB comPAnY in India, who calculated the, expenditure required between Sarat and Bombay at 5,9491. perm apttal accot shodthat 467,27831 had. been received, and 165,102b expended, leaving a balance o£ 8 in the hands of the East India Company and. 8,088 at the banker. The interest account showed that 8,330b. had been paid to the shareholders, leaving a balance of b151. in hand. STOCEPORT, DISLEY, ANTD W:ALEYBRIDGE. The formal opening of this railway took Place on Thursdy. The openmg for trafc is fixed for Mfonda week, if an injunction can be set aside which has be obtswee d bY the CromfordandHigh PeakCompany (whose line ismot used for Passengers), and which restrains the directors from opening to the publc until the two lines are united by a junction at Whaleybridge. AU1 that is wanting to this is a viaduct which may be completed in about six weeks. The line which has been constructed is 10.A miles long, ad branches from the London snd North-Western main line about half-a-mile south of the Stockport station. It passes byER[zelgrove, Disley, and New-Mills to Whaley, for each of which places there is a station. There are some deep cuttings and high enabankments; a short tunnel 50 yards in length, under the Pleak Forest Canal, and another tunnel, 187 yards long, close to the Disley station. There is a steep gradient of about three miles in length from Hazelgrove to Disley of 1 in 60. From Disley toWhaley the rise is very- sliht. The line opens a beautiful country for excursion tra eLling;and ant extension to Baxton, ditant only six miles from Whaleyr, has been suggested. Ai considerable tran inpassengers andmnineralsis expected.era hne event wa s celebrated at Disley by a dinner to about 103 guests at which Mr. J. Chapman presided. CORK, BLACKROCK, AND PASSAGE. The report of the directors of this company states that the receipts for the six months ending Apri last amoLuted to 4,7081, and for the corresponding period of 1856 to 4,4001., sbowing an increase of 30. The increase inthe expenditure amounted to 16, which Was paid principally for sleepers and rails, of which latter a large portion has not yet been used. The balance to the credit of revenue amounts to 2,611l. out of which the directors recommend a dividend of 8s. per share, free of income-tax, being at the rate of 4 per cent, per annnm, which will leave 2441. to be carried to the ne=xt accoun, subject to claims of 1244. for unpaid dividende.
REPOPtT ON THE MURAIN OF CATTL1E.-The report of Dr. 1. Ieadlam Greenhow on the murrain In horned cattle, and the eFects of the consnmption of their flesh on human healtb, has been sent in to the General Board of Health andaince printed. It formssablue-book of 60or 70 pages. The learned doctor gives a lucid account of the disease among cattle as manifested in England and on the continent. The result of his inquiry is that the cattle disesewahichhe was desiredto investigate is not of recent origmn, but has prevailed in the united kingdom among horned cattle for the last 15 or 16 years; that it is not peculiar to London; that it is probably infectious, but is also developed spontaneously ia consequence of some unknown peculiarites of breed, managrement, seaon, or locality, and is not supposed to have boeen imported frem' abroad; that it isidentical with the lwmgenseuckc, orplmonary murrin, now prevalent in Mecklenburg, aolstein, and elsewhere; and that it has no affinity with the rinderpc8t or steppe-murrain, with which it has bee confounded by some English writers. The doctor suggests that the importation of the steppe-murrain (which would be most probably by way of Prussia) should be prevented by the prohibition of the inmportation of cattle excopt from countries which have clean bills of health. It appears that meat derived from animals suffering from the pulmonary murraim, and probably other diseases, is commonly and extensively sold in London and elsewhere forhuman food, but that there is no satisfactory proof that the consequences of consuming it are directly injurious. There are reasons to suppose that the use of meat from animals suffera g tmder dise3se unknown among the cattle of the united kingdom has, abroad, been frequently attended with severe conseunences on human health. The consumption of meat un ergoimg decomposition has frequently been injurious% and such meat cannot be eaten with safety even when cooked. THE CIm SERVrCE.-GxNmEL POsT-oFF(IC.- Mr. J.

Mr. HUTT brought in this Bill, and it was read a first time. THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE. PASSING TOLLS. The question that the House, at its rising, should adjourn till Thurday, having been put, Mr. HUDSON rose to ask whether it was the intention of the Government to introduce during the present session a Bill for the abolition of passing tolls, and to amend the twas to the appointment and regulation of pilots? The hon. gentleman stated that the abolition of these tolls had been promised by the right hon. gentleman the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Labouchere) wben he repealed the navigation laws, by the late hon. member for Oxford (Mr. Cardwell), and by the right hon. gentleman the member for Oxfordshire (Mr. Henley), and was a measure which was earnestly desired by the shipping interest, which was now suffering under great depression. Tie regulation of pilots was a matter about which much difficulty was experienced in the port of Suuderland, and one which was, in his opinion, well deserving of the attention of the Governiniozt. The CHlANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUERsaid, that the subject of passing tolls vwas one which was in the hands of his right hon. friend the President of the Board of Trade. 'I he hon. gentleman not having given notice of his question his right hon. friend was not in his place to reply to it, but he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) might observe that the state of public business was suchas to render it impro bable thatany mueasure upon the subject would be speedily SAVINGS-BANS. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY complained of the delay which had taken place in the production of certain returns upon this subject for which he had moved, and which it was desirable to have laid upon the table before the second reading of the Savings-banks Bill came on. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, he was not aware of the cause of the delay, but that he should take care the papers should be produced as soon as possible. BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVE-NCY (IRELAND) Mr. J. D. FITZGERALD, in reply to WMr. VANCE, said, ie had no objection to postpone the committee upon this Bill until Thursday next. The motion that the House at its rising should adjourn till Thursday was then agreed to. PUBLIC BUSINESS. On the motion of Lord P. nUseIsro' it was ordered that upon Thursday, the 18th of June next, and upon every sacceeding Thursday during the present session, Government orders of the day should have preCedence of notices of motion.

Bertolacci, Aaditor of the Duchy of Lancaster. MILITARY EDUCATION. Sir D. L. E V A NS gave notice, that he should, on Thursday, the Ilth of lJune, muove a resolution on the subjeot of Military Education. CIVIL SERVICE. Mr. EA.SS askzed the Chancellor of tho Excheue What was the course pursued when candidates for empolly mneet on the civil service were reoommended by members of Parliamenit; whether a candidate so recommaended was aecessarilly admitted to examination; whether there was any eempetition for employment in the Civil Service, and 'whether in fact, with the exception of a simple examination, as to the ordinary qualifications for office, the old sy stem of patronage and favouritism did not still remain in foree ? The hon. gentleman said, he had been induced to put these questions in order to remove all uncertainty with respect to the subject to which they related. That such uncrtantynowexitM e ws cnviced from the nuxmber of letters whichbad been addressed ito him, stating thatba general impression prevailed throughout the country that if a member of Parliament were to recommend a candidate for examination for the public service it necessarily followed that he w ould be admit;ted to such examination. The /CHFfANCELLOTr rlg, . n,,U of the EXCIIXEQUER said, the imn pression which his hon. friend had described as prevailing out of doors was entirely erroneous, as members of Parliarnent possessed no right to nominate candidates for public Eituations which was not enjoyed in an equal degree by every other member of the community. (iear.) All the regulations which existed upon the subject were embodied in an Order in Council of May, 1855, andif his hon. friend wvould refer to that order he would find that it contained everything which it was material that he shou'd know. (A laugh.) He might add that there were also two reports upon the subject which had emanated from the Civil Service Examination Commissioners, and from which his bon. friend would be enabled tj ascertain the oianner in which the Order in Council had,been carried into effect. He would learn from that report that in addition to the ordinary examinations, in which no comn- petition took place, there ware several instances in which the beads of the public dep)artments bad selected candidates, in vhose ca.se there had been competition. That was a maatter in wvhich the heads of departments exerised their own discretion, and he might add that the eompetition wras not unlimited, but existed between a certain limited number of persons, Lord GODERICB then gave notice that upon the motion for going into committee upon the civil service estimates he should bring the subject to which his hon. friend (Mr. Bsss) adcelledtheirattention under the consideration of the CORRUPT PRACTICES PREVENTION ACT. TATF, CROSS asked the Secretary of State for the Home p)pattent whother it W28 the intention of the Goverr. msnt to extend the provisions of tho Corrupt Practices Preve ntion Act, 18i, to munuicipel elections? -He believed ti at Act had been found to work very well throughout the country. Sir G. GREBY said, it was not the intention of the Government to propose the extension of the Act to municipil electiona, It was a measure of a temporary character, and. although the hon. gentleman had said that it had worked well, it had been deemed expedient last session to appoian a Eelect committee to inquire into its operation. That committee had not been reappointed in the present session, and for the very good reason that perhaps the best test of the working of the Act would be obtained from the in. quiries which were about to take place before the electioa committees upstairs. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) HONDURAS. Mr. DISRAELL-I rise, Sir, to make inquiry of Her Majesty's Government respecting the non-ratification of the treaty entered linto by Her Majesty and the Government of the United States in reference to Honduras. I shoald be glad if the noble lord at the head of the Governmentt could state to the House the reasons why that treaty his not been ratified, and I should wish that he would also ian form us whether negotiations are still pending upon the subject, and whether any papers with regard to it are to bs laid upon the table of the Hiouse ? Lord PALMERSTON.-In answer to the right hon. gentleman I have to state that in the course of last summer two treaties were concluded by Her Majesty's Government -the one with the Republic of Honduras, the other with the Government of the United States. The object of the treaty which we entered into with Honduras was, among other things, the cession to her of what are caled the Bay Islands,-namely, Ruatan, Bonaces, and two or three other smaller islands. Those islands were, under the provisions of the treaty, ceded to Honduras upon certain conditions which Her Majesty's Government deemed it to be necessary to impose for the security and wellbeing of such British settlers as had property within them. The treaty also provides that the islands in question should not be allowed to fall into the possession of any great maritime Power; that no fortifications should be erected upon them, but that they should continus to be-that which they hitherto have been-inoffensive and non-nilitary stations. The treaty which we concluded with the United States divides itself into two distinct ports The first part contains the article of the treaty which Great Britaiu and the United States were to agree to propose to Nicaragua and Costa Rica for the purpose of settling the differences -which have arisen bebween the Spanish American States in Central America and for the future regulation of the Mosquito Indians. The other part of the treaty contained the conditions of an engagement betweenEngland and the United States,andone of these articles was to this effect-that whereas a convention had been concluded between Great Britain and Hon. duors whereby, on certain conditions, the Bay Islands had been ceded to Honduras, Great Britain and the United States engaged henceforward to acknowledge those islands as part of the territory of Honduras. This treaty was signed by my noble friend at the head of the Foreign Department (Lord Clarendon) and Mr. Dallas, the American Minister here. This treaty was sent to Honduras and Washington respectively for the rmtifLcation of those Governments. We have not yet received an official notice from Honduras whether the treaty to which I have alluded has been ratified or not by the Government of Honduras. We have, indeed, heard privately that some technical difficulties have pre. vented its ratification, but we have no offiCial information on the subject. The treaty with the United States was referred, of course, to the Senate. The Senate proposed several alterations in that treaty. Some of those alterations were of considerable importance, and one was of very great import. ance. The treaty so amnended was sent back to this country with the ratification of the Government of the United States, and we were asked to adopt those alterations. Nowr, of course, the Senate of the United States havean undoubted right to modify and alter any treaty with which they are not satisfied, and which may become the subject of discussion. But the ratification of a treaty by a sovereign Power means that that sovereign Power adopts and ratifies by its signature the engagements taken in its behalf by authorized diplomatic agents; and to ratify a treaty which having been altered by another Power, is no longer the treaty that was concluded by an authorized diplomatic agent would be against all rule and against all the principles of diplomatic usage. Therefore, even if the British Government agreed to adopt the alterations in the treaty made by the Senate after its signature, it would be necessary that a fresh treaty should bs concluded adopting those changes, and that this new treaty should be ratified by the sovereign Powers of the two countries, There were several changes made in the treaty none of them, as I have stated, unimportant, but, nevertheless, Her Majesty's Government being desirous of uAt raidng unnecessary difficulties upon a question which it was highly desirable should be settled, waived their objections to aU but one, and that was a change made not in the treaty which the two Governments proposed to Nicaragua and Costa Rica, but in the recital of that treaty. There were alterationsin that draught of the treaty which was embodied in the convention with the United States. They were far from uninwportant, yet we were prepared to adopt them. But in the other articles which were agreed to be directly contracted between the United States and Great Britain there was an alteration which I will mention. The article relating to the Bay Islands contained, as I have stated, the recital of a convention between Great Britain and Honduras for the settlement of these islands upon certain con. ditions, and it said, " Whereas such convention has been concluded between the Government of Great Britain and Honduras, and it has been agreed to consider these islands as part of the territory of Honduras." The Senate of tha United States proposed to omit aU reference to the convention between Great Britain and Honduras, and that the article should simply stand that England and the United States acknowledged these islands as part of the territory of Honduras. Now, the obvious effect would have been, by implication, and, indeed, directly, that we were making an unconditional cession of these islands to Honduras divested of those steps which we thought necessary for the well bei'ig of the colony and the fature political interests of the country. Her Majesty's Government therefore expressed their regret that they could not adopt that alteration, but they proposed an addition to the article as it was amended by the United States, which would have made the cession of these islands conclusive only upon the acceptance by Honduras of the conditions and stipulations we proposed. That proposal was sent to the United States, and the matter is stiU under negotiation. Therefore, with respect both to this treaty and to the treaty with Honduras, it is not in my power, according to the established practice, to lay these papers before the House. If, unfortunately, these negotiations do not turn out successful, it will be the duty of Her Majesty's Government to lay before the House the grourds of the stand which they have thought proper to make. If, on the other hand, the negotiations are successful and the treaty should be ratified and signed in the form which the interests of this country require, then the Houe will probably be content with the treaty without inquiring into the differences between the two countries. (Cheers) Mr. DISRAELL-I wish to know whether the alterations made in the treaty were not communicated to our representa. tive at Washington, and whether an announcement of those alterations was not received from him before the treaty was ratified and aent to this country? Lord PALMERSTON.-I do not quite comprehend the right hon. gentleman's question. Mr. DISRAELL-My'.question is, whether the alterations which Her Mlajesty's Government could not accede to were not communicated to our representative at Washington, and whether an answer to the alterations of which the noble lord complained was not sent out before the treaty was sent over here for the ratification of Her Majesty's Government ? Lord PFAL ERSTON.-I might take exception to the word "complained." [Mir. DisraelL-"Well, objected."] The Senate of the United States had a right to make whit alterations they pleased in the treaty if they thought it no' fit to be agreed to. No doubt the probability of some alterations being made in the treaty by the Senate was communi. cated by our Minister at Washington. That arrived before the treaty, but our answer was communicated on the offi3ial communication of the result of the deliberations of the Senate. THE PRINCESS ROYAL'S ANNUITY BILL. The EHouse went into coanmittee on this Bill. On clause 1, giving an annuity of 8,0004. to the Princess Royal, Mr. BOWYER, in rising to propose that the annuity should cease to bo payable in the evernt of her Royal Highness becoming Qaeen Consort of Prussia, said, that the reasons both for and against his amendment were so obvious that it would be best to introduceit briefly. He participated in those feelings of affectionate loyalty which pervaded not only that Hlouse but all classes of this country. Indeed, wben he looked back to the history of this country up to the Norman conquest (ironical cheers) he did not fini that any better S overeign than Her Majesty had ever sat upon the throne of this country. But these feelings, how. ever laudable and just, ought not to influence the House in deciding a matter like the present, and it seemed to him that all the reasons in favoar of this provision for the Princess Royal, however just they might be under present circumstanes, did not apply to th9 event of her Royal Highness becoming Queen Cowrt of Prussia. It was most desirable for the honour of the prusssian Crown that the Queen Consort of Pras3ia should not be in the receipt of a pension from a foreign State. iet was sure that we should no t like to ee a Q aeea Consort of England placed in that position; and he felt confident there woukl be a strong feeling, especially amorg the middle classes ot this ountry, AgabAt aab -nuil papy ment to the Qneen Consort of an independent nation. Such a continued payment would be a constant source of irritatiomn il the country (hear, hear), and candidates on th3 nstings would ho asked whether they concurred in it, or u propose its repeaL Some illustration on this poiut was a or ed by the case of the King of Belgium, who, it was well known, dud not apply to his own use the sum he eceved frou havng been the husband of the Princess Charlotte. Yet candidates at elections had been questioned in regard to that pensions and a strong feeling had been expressed at the hustings against the Sovereign of a foreign country deriving anything from the Exchequer of England. He (Mr. Bowyerl was aware that precedents might ba cited against him. His answer was that precedents drawn from things done in the reigns of George IL and George Ill, under unreformed Parliaments, ought not to be bindilg upon them. Indeed, such precedents rather zesembled the lighthouse placed on a rock to warn people off than the sign-post which pointed the way they should go. (Alaugh.) His amendment, which had been lilghtly altered since he put it on the paper, Was that the annuity to the Princess Royal should be suspnded during the time she might be Queen Consort of Prussia. But, looking to the possible contingenoy which he trusted would not ocour, of her becoming a widow and surviving the Prince, he proposed that in the event of her Royal EHighness surviving her intended husband, after he had been King of Prussia, her allowance should revive, and its payment be resumed. Hgis reason was this:- on becoming a widow her Royal Highness would very probably return to her own country. At any rate she would be regarded more as an English than a foreiga princess. In this shape he believed his proposal would be more favourably received by many hon. members than if it made the annuity entirely to cease from the date of the Princess Royal becoming Queen Consort of Prussia. The hon. gentleman conoluded by moving to add to clause 1 tbe words:-" Provided, however, that in the event of ber Royal Highness becoming Queen Consort of Prussia the said annuity shaU cease and determine from the date of the accession of his Royal Highness Prince Frederick William of Prussia to the throne of Prussia." The question having been put, The CHANCELLOR of the EXOHEQUER said,-I will endeavour to follow the example of the hon. and learned member for Dandalk by addressing the House very briefly; and I can hardly think that any very elaborate argument: s needed to convince them of the propriety of rejecting the amendment which he has proposed. I could understaud any member of this Ifouse objecting that the whole Proposition of the Government respecting the provision for the Princess Royal was excessive and extravagant; that, looking lo the compact made between the Queen and the country at Her Majesty's accession, it is her duty to provide for her children; and that this House ought not to be caUed upon to vote anything for the dowry of her eldest daughter. I could comprehend, I say, an hon. gentleman taking that course, and putting an entire negative on the propositiin of Her Majesty's Government; but I confess I cannot ap preciate the merit of such counter motions as have beea submitted to the House,-such minute, such "nibbling" motions (if I may be allowed the word), first reducing the annuity of Her Royal Highness from 8,0001. to 6,0001. per annum, and then crowning this species of propositions by the singular amendment at present under discussion. The bon. and learned member has now made his motion smaUer and more diminutive than the one of which he originally gave notice. The notice he gave at the outset was to put an end to the annuity if the Princess Royal should become Queen Consort of Prussia. He nowamends his amendment, and converts this into a sort of shifting or springing annuity, to be paid as long as she remains the consort of the son of thePrmceof Prussia. She would continue, I presume, to enjoy this allowance if her father-in-law should suceeed to the throne, and if she became consort of the heir apparent. Should she, however, become Queen Consort of Prussia, she is to be deorived of her annuity ! But the hon. gentlemaa hopes that she may die during the life of her husband. (Laughter and dissent.) He wished her, as I understood him, to be short-lived, in the hope that she might not survive her husband; but in the event of the unfortunate calamity of her being blessed with longevity (renewed laughter) her allowance is to revive-this grant is to spring up again, and she is to be entitled to 8,0001. a-year. I do not believe that an arrangement of that sort would redound to the credit of this country. (Hear, hear.) For myself I would far rather agree that this Bil be read a second timne this day six months, and give up the arrangemenit altogether. What should we think of the person who proposed such an arrangement in private life ? (Hear, hear.) Would anybody reaUy propose, on the marriage of a lady to the heir of a fortune or a landed estate, that she should enjoy a oertain annuity till her father-in-law died-that, on her husband succeeding to the estate, she should be deprived of that annuity; but, in the event of her becoming a widow, that the allowance should again come in force ? Such a settlement would not be deemed very honourable to those who framed it; and i cannot think it is the wish of this House that if the Princess Royal forms an alliance with the presumptive heir of Prussia-a marriage higher perhaps in rank than any contracted before by a Princess of this kingdom-she should be placed, if her husband succeeds to the throne, in a situation of entire dependence on the bounty of the Royal Family of Prussia, and that no contribution should be made by the country of her birth to maintain her dignity and support the exalted position she wiUl have to occupy. Considering what is due to the honour of the Crown, I cannot but believe that even the national pride of this country would prevent the House from acceding to a motion like that of the hon. and learned member. (Hear, hear.) I therefore trust it will not receive tha countenance of hon. gentlemen, but will be negatived by a large majority. (Hear, hear.) Mr. W. WILLIAMS said that, having himself given notice of a motion similar to the present, he should cordially support the hon. and learned gentleman's proposal. He was not a little surpnsed to find Her Mfajesty's Government opposing so reasonable a motion. (Laughter.) He should like to know what could be the feeling of a King of Prussia who could allow his Queen to be a pensioner paid out of the taxes on the people of England. A man of so little spirit could hardCy be a very desirable husband for the Princess Royal. (Laughter.) What would Her Majesty and the people of this country say if his Royal Highness the Prince unsore derived an annuity from the taxes of Saxe Coburg? They would be ashamed of it, and would not permit it for one moment. That the people of England should be taxed to maintain a foreign Queen, and especially the Queen of a high Power like Prussia, would be most degrading to that country; and so far from this being a " nibbling" proposition, it was one which, if carried, would conduce greatly to the respect in which Her £Majesty and her august family were held. Taxes for such objects as that proposed by the Bil were the most likely of al other things to bring the Royal Family nto a position with respect to the people very different from that which they now occupied. He hoped, although he knew there was not much ground for hoping, that the hon. gentleman would carry thin motion. (Laughter.) He was quite convinced that it would be most acceptable to the country at large. The House had acted very liberally in ranting this annuity as well as the dowry of 40,0001.; and it would be unjust to the people of England if she were to continue to receive an annity of 8,0001. after she had become Queen of Prussia. Ar. WALTER thought that the very circumstance of this discussion showed how much more sensible the arrangsment that was suggested by his hon. and learned friend the member for Sheffield would have been (had it been proposed in a more definite and specific form) than the scheme which had been submitted by the Government. It must be confessed that it would be somewhat unbecoming in the Princess Royal to continue to be a pensioner on the people of England when she became Queen of Prussia. (Hear.) At the same time he could not support the proposition of hi, hon. friendthememeber for Dnndalk unless it underwent some alteration. He should like to suggest, by way of compromise that the annuity should cease altogether when the Princess Royal became Queen of Prussia; but that a corresponding increasc should be madein the annuity for the limited perioI antecedent to that event-that it should be 12,0u01. instead of 8,00W. (" Oh !"~), and should cease absolutely when the Pincess Royal became Queen of Prussia. He believed that as a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence that would be a very good bargain for the country. (Hlear.) If it were possible to propose such an amendment on the proposition of his hon. friend he should be disposed to do so. Mr. DISRAELL-Every state of this measure, and every form in which these propositions come before us, has only the more and more convinced me of the folly and extreme injustice of placing the Crown in the position of making this application to the House of Commoms. (Hear.) It Is necessary to remind the House over and over again, that the Crown has possession of an estate perfeetly adequate to furnish all that is required for the convenience, comfozts, and happiness of the Queen and the Royal Family, and for establishing every branch of that family, however numerous, in a manner worthy of the Royal Family of England without coming down to Par- liament for any grant whatever. (Hear.) It appears, by evi dence which anyhon. gentleman may refer to, that the Cro en Estate brings into our Exchequer 260,0001 per annum. (Hear.) With an estate to that amnount surely the, Crown would be in a position to supply all that is necessary for the cormfort and convenience of the Crown, and for establishing every branch of the Royal Family. In all that is necessary for the wise pageantry connected with the Crown the country is as much and more interested than the Crown itself. We know very well that under ordinanv circtumstances that pageantry is not had recourse to, but o all occasions of public ceremonials in which the august individual who is the representative of ournationalinstitutionsperforms public dutiesthatpagenntryisrequied,andtheHouseof Commons is bound to furnish the expenditure wdhich it entails. Unfortunately, on the accession of Her Majestytothe throue, but no dob by the advice of those who believed that they were gvn sound advice to the Crown, Hler Majesty entered int this compact which we now call the Civil List. But let the House consider under what circumstances a youthful Sovereign is called upon to enter into arrangements of that kind. What experience of tho world could a YOuthful Sovereign have as to the feelings of a community which she might be called upon to govern I if it had not been for the coCpact then entered into it woulh not have bemu necessary to make this application to the House of CorAmens. It may now be impossible to change toe arrangemont entered into with the Crown, butt it is for these who advige the Crown to consider whetber it might not he advisAble to do so. I suppose that no person in this House may live till another rei-gn, hut if I should have the opportunity I'jhould urge-Upon the advisers of the Soverelign that a cempact so un-s4e as regards the dignity of tbe Crown as the Civil List of- 4182 ought never to have been cOuId not afford to keep her any longer there. He paid for the quarter the sum of 91. los. She appears to have been benefited by her stay in tho asylum, but she has relapsed into her old state since she camo home. She also is kept .n j a mfost filhy stato." The parents were reported as naturally inclined to be dirtyj In the extreme, and as drauken in their habits. They dran J a good deal of whisky, they said, to drivo care away when they thought of their daughters. He now approached a very sad and painful part of thecase-the number of lunatic ;women in Scotland who had given birth to children, aud whose mental defect was frequently manifested in their offspring. (Bear, hear.) "These," said the commissioners, we have ascertained to "Amount to not 2ess than 126, and there is cause to 'believe that manv cases of this description have escaped obrervation, and, also, that the fact of such weak-minded females baving given birth to offspring has often, for obvious reasons, been designedly concealed. Accordingly, large as the above number appears, we are satisfied it should be taker considerably higher. It niust be kept in view, too, that many of there womnen have given birth to several ebildren.' In one county-Ayr he thought-there were 15 idiot mothers with 31 children. In Latheron, in Caithness, with a population of about 8,000, eight mothers were returned with 10 children, while one woman was reported pregnant. The largest numbar of children anywhere returned to one fatuous female were five. The commissioners said, and ho agreed with them, that- "It thus becomes a question of very serious import whether, for the sake of public morality and civil policy, all fatuous females should not be restricted in their liberty, and he gathered together in poorhouses." (Hear, hear.) On referring to the particular cases given in the appendix he found that many female paupers, insane fromi birth, had borne one, two, and three children each, and opposite their names was tho following remark, '- Not sufficienitly clothed, fed, orcared for." In many instances the ailowancts from the poor's funds ranged from 9a. to 20s. a.quarter-snms utterly inadequate for the maintenance of these poor women. (Rear, hear.) Distressing as were the cases which he had mentioned, there were others ten times worse remaining behind-so horrible, indeed, that he durst nat venture to shook the feelings of the House by relating them. There were other cases of a similar kindreportedby the commtssioners,- " The fatuous paupers of the city of Edinburgh, living with relatives or strangers, are 12 in number, and the allowance for some of them, though boarded with stranges, is only 2s. a-week. Complaints arc made that this is insufficient, and, indeed, the fact is self-evident; for, although certain articles of clothing are also found by the parish, it is clear that 2s. a-week is a very inadequate sum wherewith to provide lodging and food for adult paupers and to afford remuneration for the trouble of looking after them. Such cases as these show either a want of proper supervision of the fatuous poor by inspectors or else a culpable economy on the part of parochial boards. Of these lunaties 937 are plac:d with strangers, and 191 are not under the care of any one. Of those placed with strangers as many as 489 are women. Tho pauper lunatics amount to 1,998 man of whom shonld be placed in asylums, and who are leftin teir present circumstances from their condition being imperfectly reported to the Board of Supervision. When estimating the condition of the insane not in establshments it should be remembered that the details furnished by us give only an imperfect representation of the true state of rmat. ters. They form only a part of the picture of nisery, and had we been able to extend our investigations it would, we are convinced, have assumed a much darker shade. We possess little or no information as to the condition of those vwho have no one to take charge of them." The constitution of the commission was such as to remove all suspicion of partiality or interested motives. It consisted of two gentlemen experienced in cases of lunacy and fully acquainted with the treatment of such cases, of a very experienced lawyer in Edinburgh, himself a sheriff of a most populous county, and therefore not a likely man to say anything unnecessarily harsh against his brother sheriffa or, the Board of Superversion; and of a inaedical gentleman of Edinburgh fully qualified to deal with the subject. All the commissionears appeared to have set about their task with an earnest desire to ascertain the real facts, and had spared no labour in pursuing their objects. He would next refer the House to the report of the Board of Supervision which had been recently laid upon the table, dated August of last year. For four years previously the Board had reported " no change in our manner of proceeding in regard to' unatic paupers," but in their lst report they stated- " Having ascertained that in some instances the necessary legal forus had not been observed in reference to fatutous paupers who were inmates of poorhouses, we consldered it necessary to call the attention of parochial boards. inspoctors of poor, poorhouse committees, and offlcials of poorhouses to the requirements of the law in regard to this class of the poor. As we had no reason to believe that the irregularities which had arisen proceeded from any improper motive, we contented ourselves with explaining to the parochial authorities the requirements of the statutes, and warning paro. chial boards and their oficers as to the danger of neglecting them." He thought that a board of supervision that could pen such a garaph should be abolished as soon as possible. (Hear, hear.)e could not understand how any Government could remain assive after the publication of a dtatement which ne would not call wilfully false, but at least culpably incoorrect. (Hear, hear.) The declaration that they had confined themselves to " explaining to the parochial authorities the requirements of the statute," after the facts published by the commissioners, was, he could only think, an insult to the common stnse of the Government and the country. (Hear, hear.) Be thought he had mnade out acae tojustifyhiscalngatten. tion to t is matter, and, although he did not call upon the Government to legislate upon the subject of asylums, as he was sure they intended to do so, yet he felt it necesary to a.k what was to be done at the present moment to put an end to those horrors which he had described. (Hear.) What was to be said to those authorities who had so culpably allowed the law to be disregarded? (Hlear.) If the Govern. ment did not intend to pronounce a severe censure upon those authorities, he conceived they would be abdicating their functions. The suggestions of the commissioners were not moderate; they recommended that regflationsshould be made by which pauper lunatios might be brought under proper 'visitation, and that steps should be immediately taken to prevent a continuance of that ill-treatment of which they quoted so many instances. The commisioners also recomn^.ended that rules should be framed for the guidance of the Board of Supervision; but he (Mr. Ellice) thought that a board of supervision which required rules for its guidance was a misnomer. The control of paupers had been continued to that board when the right hon. bonetthe member for Carlisle (SirJ. Graham) introduced the new Poor Law Bill, because its members were supposed to be beat acquainted w;ith the wants of the country, and of the mode of meeting those wants. They bad failed in their daty, and he theref,re asked Ithat a direct condemnation should be passed upon those who had so neglected their charge, and that some statement might be made of the measures to be adopted to potect paur lunatics from continued neglect and abuse. (Hear, h.r.iTe Sir G. GREY.-I am rot surprised that my hon. friend, as a representative of Scotland, should have felt it to be his duty upon the earliest opportunity to call the attention ofI will not say the Government, for our attention has already been attracted-but the attention of the House and the country to the report recently made by the commissioners appointed two years ago to inquire into the state of lunatic asylums, and on the care and treatment of lunatics in Scot. land, containing, as that report does, statements of facts and allegations calculated to cast the utmost discredit upon that portion of the United ingdom in which such things happened. (Hear, hear,) I shall not foRow my hon. friend through the details of the report, but can only express a hope that the observations he has made may lead hon. members to read that report themselves (hear, hear), and especially those members who are returned by Scotch constituencies, because upon them mainly depends the adoption of those means which alone can beeffectual toremedy thegreat evils complained of; andXI trust that the perusal of the report will secure the hearty co-operation ef every member from that part of the United Kingdom in the adoption of measures which will prevent the contlnuance of such a state of things. In one respect only do I differ from my hon. friend; I do not know whether he meant exactly what I collected from his statement, but I understood him to state that the law in Scotland was far from being defeotive, that the law provided safeguards and securities for the proper treatment and care of the helpless class whose condition we are considering, but thae the defects revealed by the report arose from a defective administration of that law. Mr. ELLICE-I confined that statement to the case of pauper lunatics. Sir G. GREY.-Then, I must say that, as to pauper lunatics, especially, I think this report shows great defects in! the present state of the law. Allow me to caU the attention of the House to the concluding portion eo the reprrt, which is the key to most of the abuses therein detailed, " Gross anomalies exist in the statute. Thus,-the statute requires that pauperlunatics should he sent to a publicasylum, whileit omitsto make any provisionbyenactmrnt for the erection of suoh establishments." There does not exist at the present moment in Scotland one single establishment supported by local rates or by pablic funds appropriated by the State. The only asylums of which favourable mention can be made are those which are teamed chartered asylums, owing their origin to the munificent benevolence of individuals, but which are self-sapPorting because they only receive a clam of patients whose rriends are in a position to pay for their maintenance. After these asylums, which can only reoeive a limnited number of the superior class of luratics, the commissioners speak of tho licensed houses, poorhosises, and those portin-ns of poorhouses appropriated to the reception of launatics as of the worst possible description, as, indeed, might well be expected when we find no provision made for the reception of that class of paupers who most need careful keeping, but who, ir many eases, at present are subjected to treatment too horrible to contemplate. This report very olearly demonstrates a most defective state of the law, especially as respects the provision that ought to be made for the unfortunate class of pauper lunati¢s- defects that once existed in this country, but which haveI been remedied by imposing on every borough and county in England the duty of providing out of local fands establishnients, subject to the approval of the Government, in which the care and treatment of these unfertunate persons may be properly attended to. (Rear, hear.) I can assure my hon. friend that as soon as that report came into My hands, only 15 days ago, my attention was immediately directed towards it. nHear, hear.) I lost no time in consulting my learned friend the Lord-Advocate M to the measures which ougbt to be taken; and I shall now state generally what steps have been taken and what steps we intend to take regarding it. (Hear, hear,) Eirst of all, let me say that I entirely ooncur 'with my hion, friend in the tribute of admiration wbicb he has pd th e benevolence of 14a AmiterlcFlady WhI 6xMQ time ago visited this country and took a deep inteie3t in the velfare of tbis unfortunate class of being. Tbat lady Fent to Scot'a id, and on her behalf an application was made to mre to enable her to get access to an establishments for tho reception of lunaties. The Dake of Argyll, Lord Shaftesbuly, end the Lord.Advocate were aware of ber wishes and represented them to me, and I most cordially agreed to give ber every facility in visiting those establishmepts. (Hear, bear.) As my hon, friend has informed the House, the Quveznment, about two years ago, thought it desirable to issue a commission for a fuller investigation of the whole of this subject than had previously taken place. We were desirous that that commission should be so composed as ts insure an efficient discharge of the importaut duties intrused to it. I put myself in communication with the lunacy commissioners bere, and two gentlemen were Eelected-Mr. Campbell and Mr. Gaskell-assisted by Dr Coxe, an eminent man who has devoted much of his time and attention to this subject, and who entered most sedalously into the inquiry. With them was associated DIr. Sheriff MIonteith, and the siim of their labours is now before us. I am bound to say that they have discharged thei duty with great ability and honesty (hear, hear), and I trust the result will be to confer an inca culable boon upon the unfortunate class into whose case they were apDointed to inquire. (Hear, hear.) As my hon. friend seem to intimate that the Board of Supervision and other authorities in ScotlanAd bad thrown obstacles in the way of the inquiries of the commissioners, I beg to call the attention of the House to one paragraph in the report which by no means bears out my hon. friend's statement. In that paragraph it is Paid - `We take this opportunity of acknowledging our obligations to the various legal autthorities ; the Board of Supervision for lIelief of the Poor, and parochial inspectors; the General Board of Prisons and governors of Drisons; the secretaries and superintendents of pablic asylams; and to many of the proprietors of private asylums, for the wilinag and ready manner in which they aided us in our ir.quizies." I have to state to the House that a't, even acursoryper. sal of the report I thought itimy duty to address a letter to the Board of Supervision, enclosn copy of the report and appendix, and informing theboagrd that the statement of facts therein related was one that demanded and would receive the immediate attention of the Government with the view of applying a remedyto-the evils then brought to light; but that, independent of anygeneral measares which the Government might propose, the attention of the board ought to be directed to the allegations of cases of craelty and neglect that had taken-place in the administration ofthe existing law. (Hlear, hear.) I rece.ved an acknowledgment of that latter from Sir J. M'Neill, the President of the Board of Supervision, thanking me for the communication and expressing his desire to be furnished with more definite information on various points adverted to-in the report. I accordingly addressed a letter to the lunacy commissioners, a'king them to supply all the information that could be required by the board, in order to a fall investigation of the various cases. (Hear, hear.) I will not enter into a defence of the Board of Supervision; and I think gentlemen ought to suspend their judgments, and not ask the Government to pass a censure on the board till they have heard the statement that will be made by the board itself. (Hear, hear.) I believe my hon. friend has verymuch overrated the power of the Board of Supervision as to controL I am far from saying they are free from blame; but on reading the report it isplaiL that whatever blame exists is shared with them by the parochial boards, by the inspectors of the poor, by the Bherifis, the clergy, the justices of the peace, and the commissioners of supply. (Hear, hear.) One in the existing law is the miperfect responsibility thrown upon these persons, no one being called on to take on himself the undivided responsibility that is necessary to the due performance of duties of this kind. (Hear, hear.) I have also to state that my learned friend the Lord Advocate has addressed a letter to the sheriffs of counties, sending them a copy of the report, and calling thdir attention to the alleged cases of neglect of duty on the part of sheriffs in the exercise of the ministerial powers given to them bylaw and asking in such cases for any explanation they may Lave to offer. (Hear, hear When these explanations are given my learned friend wiil know what course it will be proper to take regarding them. With regard to individual cases of gross cruelty, or illegal proceedinga, I may observe that these particular cases are now under the consideration of the lord Advocate. (EHear, hear.) Time is, however, required in order to do faul justice to these cases, and I hope the House wiU bear in mind that only 15 days have elapsed since a printed copy of thetreport was put into my hauds. (Hear, hear.) I trust it wil be tho opinion of the House that the Govemment have lost no time in taking those measures that were thought neces;sar to correct what may be amiss in the administration of e present law. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the steps hereafter to be taken I may observe that we intend to ask Parliament for a Bil calculated to remove aU those defects in the law that are proved to exist by the statements made in this report. The late Lord Rutherford, when Lord Advocate, brought in a Bil that, if passed, would, I believe, have remedied all the evils now complained of. That BIl was read a second time with the warm approbation of many Scotch members on both sides of the House, and was by common consent referred to a select committee - but the opposition raised to it in Scotland on the miserable ground of the expense it would incur (hear, hear) proved fatal to the measure, and the Lord Advocatefound himself unable tocarryit. (Hear, hear,) Itisdeeplytobelamentedthat hewasnotablesuccessfully to deal with thatmeasure; but I trust that a different reslt will be arrived at with regard to the BiU which my learned friend will propose to the House. (Hear, hear.) I trust the disgrace that now attaches to Scotland in this matter will ba thereby removed, and that this and the other House of Parliament will cordially co-operate with the Government in the adoption of those measures that are necessary for the relief of the unforturate class of persona referred to in this report, (Hear, hear.) Mr. DRUMIIOND (who was very indistinctly heard) was understood to say that when Lord Rutherford was Lord Advocate he (hIr. Drammond) endeavoured to get Eome returns that would give information to the House on this question. Everybodywho knew Lord Rlltherford would say that a more humane man never existed, and accordingly he obtained from him every asistauco in his power to procure tho returns which he desired; but all his eforts were fruitless. Both he and the Lord Advocate vwere beaten by the systematio opposition of every single person who was consulted, (Hear, hear.) He was unable to procure the returns, and the ground of the opposition was the dread of the expense which might be incurred. (Hear, hear.) The way in which tbey treated the poor in Scotland was perfectly scandalous, and in nothing did the system appear so bad as in the treatment of pauper lunatics, the rich lunatics being sufficiently well taken care of. On reading the report one could not help being struck, in the first place, with the neglect of duty by the aheriffa, and, in the next, with the total neglect of duty exhibited by aU the magistrates. How was It that throughout the whole of Scotland there was not one clergyman who could find time to visit these poor creatures? True, there was one, but when he went to the asylum ho was refused admittance; and why? Because bewasaPapist. (Hear, hoar.) ThePoorLaw, asmanaged by the Board of Supervision, had been well defined to be *' a law for depriving the poor of their just rights." (Hear, hear.) Three cases which he had taken at hazard wel iUeus. trated this :-A woman of 64 years oF age, who had lost the use of her right arm, who hbd asthma and a cough, wa3 allowed 2s. a-month; one of which was deducted for some purpose or the other. Another poor woman, deserted by her husband, with three children under seven years of age, lived aU day on a tUtnip, which one of the children stole out of a garden. To an Irishman, a Roman Catholic, with : n asthma and an ulcerated leg, they gave nominaUy 4x. a- week, but the inspector kept back 3s. of it for rent. All these cases were refused by the Board of Supervision repeatedly until some person, with whom he was weU acquainted, but whose name he would not mention, insisted upon having a row made about them. fNow, that this report was fresh in everybody's mind, was the time for doir g memthing to remedly those evils, hut he warued the LordAdvocate that unless he excerted himlself to the utmost e! would meet with the same discomfiture as Lord Ruther- Mr. F. DUNDAS was understood to deny the truth of a particular case stated in the report, but owing to the low tone in which the hon. member spoke it was impossible to ascertain to which case he referred. Sir T. E. COLEBROOKE, as a Scetch member, took sorne shame to himself for the disgraceful state of thin1s which had been disclosed by the speech of the hon. meinber for St. Andrews. After all, the greatest share of the - sib31ity maust rest on the Imperial Parliament for not 'lnL ago taking meaures to put an end to these evils. The oome Secretary was quite correct in attributing the oppoEition whichLord Rutherfurd's Bill bad met with to motives of economy; and a very uistaken eoonomy it was, for it was a well-known fact that patients afflicted with this distressing malady, who might ea8ily have beeu cured at first, became incurable for want of care and attention, and that a permanent charge was thrown on the ratepayers. Mr. KINNAIRD expressed his gratitude to his hon. friend for the very able manner in which he had laid this disgraceful feature in the administration of the Scotch Poor Law before the House. Some hon. muembers, he believed, were under a missapprehension that one of the cases of gross cruelty described by his hon. friend had occurred in the Perth Asylum, but that was notthe fact. The case in ques- won occurred elsewhvere, but the patient was afteorsaards brought into the Perth Asylum, and there treated with great humanity and kindness. (Hear, hear.) He had always been in the habit of visiting the asylum in the town which be represerAed (Perth), and he was glad to find that it was not one of those which had disgraced Scotland. (Hear, bhar.) Great praisa was due to the Home Secretary for tho vigoutr with which he had prosecuted this matter. Colonel SYKES said, that a remedy must be applied to this evil at the earliest possible period, and the lunacy commission of England afforded an example of one which eould not fail to be successful. Up to a recent period thecondition of lunatics in England was quite as bad as it had been desclibed tobe in Scotland. Inthe year 1835, however, the exertions of Mr. Robert Gordon and some other gentlemen procured the establishmient of the Lunacy Commission. That commission, of which he (Colonel Sylces) was for ten years an unpaid member, found that even in respectable licensed establishments, in which 501., 60., and 1001. per annum was paid by the friends of the inmates, the patients were chained to their chairs and their beds. The commission had put an end to the existence of these and other atrocities in Eulaud, and he had no doubt that its extension to Scotland, or. the establishment of a similar body consisting of stipendiazies and philanthropists there, would produce similar results in thatt country. The LORD-ADVO04ATE said that, So far from regretting the publication of tbis report, or the statements made by hit bon. friend, ho rejoiced at them from the bottom of his heart, because ibis state of things had for a long time been a disgraoe arAd a scandal to Scotland. The people of. that contry hr4j known that it was a disgrae and a scandaL Au attemPt 'bad been made to remedy it, but that attempt had failed. (Hlear, hear.) The commissioners in their report aW4gested certain matters as the groundwork of a remedy, avd in referring to the measure intsoduced by his I te much lamented friend? Ulod Butherfurd, he

LONDON, SATURDAY, MAY 0, 1857. In t'he House of Commons, in reply to an inquiry by Air. BASS, The CHANCELLOR: of tho EXCEEQUER said the irn- pression that candidates for employment in the Civil Service were nominated by members of Parlia. ment was erroneous; that members of Parliament had no moro right to nomieate than was possessed by other persona, aud that~ all the regulations upon this subject vwere to be found in the order in Council of May, 1855. * MEr. DJsniAEi inquiired the reasons for the nonratificatiol of the Treaty between HuEr MAJEsTy and tho G-overnment of the United States about Honduras, tho prewent state of the negotiations, and whether the papers would be lWid before Parliament ? Lord PALtsnstoN replied that in the course of laat summer two treaties 1ad been concluded by IF= 3fAJiSm's Governmetit,-one with thleRtpblis O lionduras, which, among other thing., coded to the Republic the Bay Idlands upon certain Mc&I.tions; the other treaty, with 'the (ernnmeit of the United States, the details of which he exr lained, had reference to Nicragua and Cost viCa, as well as to the treaty with Hondraa The treaties were signed by Lord CLAxzziON and Mr. DAMAS, and xent to Honduras and WAahingtonrespectively for ratification. No offleial notice had been received from Honduras whether that treaty would be ratified or not. The treaty with the United States was, when received, reerrend to the Senate, which had proposed certain alteratios, and, thtt amended, it had been sent back to this country for ratification with its modirmationw. Although the changes were not unimportant, Han MA3z&x's Goverrnent kad waived their objeetions to all except one, which tbey felt it their daty zot to adopt, since the effect of the change woufd be to make an unconditional cesion of the islandr to Honduram, divested of stipulations which tYp* deemed indispensable. HZK bIAjScy's Govervment had prepared certain modifications, which had been sent to the United St&teW' Government, and the matter was ttill under negotiation. I; thi' state of things it was not the practice to lay the papers before the House. Mr. DisR.Ami inquired whether the alteration of which Lord PAnSansrox complained had been communicated to HEE MAJzSry'S representative at Washington, and the answer to the commmnication made before the treaty was sent here for ratification? Lord PAimERstoa maid no doubt the probability of such an alteration had been communicated to our Minister at WVashington; but the answer of Him MAiar's Government had been founded upoi the officialintimation from the Government of the4fnited States. TheHouse having resolved itself into a Committee upon the Princess Royals Annuity Bill, Mr. Bowmrc moved an amendment, the effect of whi& was to suspend the annuity in the event of her Royal Highnes becoming Queen Consort of Prussia, the annuity to revive in the possible ulteriorevent of widowhood. STe OC OELLOn. of the E32;CHEQtM Opposea what he termed a minute and nibbling diminution of the annuity, which would not, he thought, redound to the credit of England. He would prefer, he said, that the annuity should be rejected altogether. Mr. W. WLiAs support dthe amendment. After a short but interesting discussion, in which Mr. WALTaR, MIr. DiSRAML, Sir F. BAXIrC, and Mr. RoxnVuc participated, the amendment was withdrawn, and the Bill passed through the committee. On the order for going. into a Committee of Supply, M.r. R 131GOe caDed attention to the report of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the State of Lunatics in Scotland, and the necessity of securing to pauper lunatics better protection and maintenance, the treatment of this unhappy class in Scotlaud (4,60G in number) evincing, according to the details read byr MIr. I3L1IC, in many cLaes great neglect and crnelty as regards their reception, their custody, anld their removal from one place to another. These detaiLs wrere of a most painlful and even repulsive character, and MIr. Ezrcu did not hesitate to chargethe authorities with culpable complicity, and asked the Government to visit them with direct condemnation. Sir G. Gm was not surprised at the indignatioln manifested by Mr. ELuc' at the gross cases of abuse and neglect revealed in the report of the commisioners, and hoped that the perusal of that report would evince the hearty. co-operation of Scotch members in providing a remedy for a radically defective administration of the law. He differed from Mr. ELLICE only in one respect. The law had provided safeguards against these evils - the great defect was in the administration of the law. As soon as the report was in the hands of the Government (only 15 days ago) his attention was immediately given to it; he conferred with the LORD ADvocATr and called the attention of the Board of Supervision to the gross neglect and abuses in the administration of the law disclosed in the report. Some of the cases of illegal neglect and cruelty were under the consideration of the LoiD. ADVOCATE, who would in due time propose to Parliament a Bill for remedying the present state of things in regard to pauper lunatics in Scotland. Mr. DRtmmoiw, MIr. F. DUNDAS, Sir T. CoTaBROOxE, AIr. KixANAD, and Colonel SrxEs having spoken upon the aubject, The LORD ADvocATX said the state of things disclosed in the report had been a disgtace and scandal to the country. Every one of the suggestions of the commissioners had been introduced into the Bill of the Lord Advocate RonimTso.,- in 1848, and, if that bil had passed, these abtuses would have been put an end to. It was, however, resistedin Scotland, and large counties had petitioned against it; but now he believed, if he proposed these remedies, the biU would pass both Houses, After some furthcr discussion, the House went into Committee of Supply upen the remaining army estimates, when votes were agreed to, after discassion, to make up, with the sums already voted on account, the following amounts:- 37G,2381. for manufacturing establishment,, &c.. 332,8681. for the wages of artificers and labourers. 418,5701. for clothing and necessaries. 955,9001. for provisions, forage, &c. 599,1911. for warlike stores. 245,1331. for fortifications. The Chairman was then ordered to report progress. On the order for going into Committee upon the MIinisters' Money (Ireland) Bill, Lord J. MAxrsnS objected; but, after a short discussion, in the course oE which it was stated by Mr. H[oasw, and admitted by Mr. G. A. HLTOi, that the ordinary reveaue of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners was 99,00UI., and their ordinary espend'iture (including 12,000I. for Mfinisters' MEoney) 97t,000UL, the Hyouse went into Committee on the BQil, the clauses of which were agreed to. The CaANCELLOR of the ExCIEQuER withdrew the Savings-banks Bill, and obtained leave to introduce another. The Cinque Ports Act Amendment Bill was read a third time and passed. The LoaD ADvocATE obtained leave to bring in a Bill to regulate certain procedure in the Commissary Courts in Scotland, and Mr. LowEv a BiU to amend the Joint-Stock Companies Act, 1856. After some further business, theHouse adjourned, at half-past o'clock, until Thursday next.
A distinguished personage has observed, that the acme of human happiness is 5,0001. a-year, with a good house in town and no estate in the country. No one but a landed proprietor can appreciate the truth of that estimate. He may be a great man; he may do his duty; he may preserve his game and manage his land well; he may keep on good terms with his neighbours, his parson, and his tenants; but he ia not a happy man. He must sacrLfice comfort to self-respect, uefulness, and honour. When so much is to be said for such a maxim as the above We will confess ourselves surprised to find its ingenious propounder regretting that his beloved SOvrnItG. has been placed by a provident people in the very position to which he has assigned the palm of happiness. Queen VIcTop.%A has a decent town house, a handsome establishment, a private purse of 60,0001. a-year, a Parliament to provide for her children, and no " estates in " the country." Of course, we need not thinlk of the marine villa in the Isle of Wight and the shooting box in the Highlands, which she has been able to buy for herself. what we mean is, that she has not the cumbrous charge of a huge rentroll, leases, fines, manors, and all sorts of proper. ties, subject to all kinds of charges and depreda. tions. There are a few noblemen in the country who make these things pay, buit they do so by making themselves literally the stewvards of their own property. At all eventb, ths history of the Cnowx property under EER MAJESTX'8 predeessors is one long story of Iwate, iil§Vt, mismausgemebt, fraud, and qpi
The old-fashioned treatment of Lunatics, as ,developed in the " Report of the Scottish Lunacy "'Commission," was brought before the House of Commons last night by 3Ir. E. ELTCE. This system is happily so obsolete in this country that we rank it with the barbarisms of the middle ages. Handcuffs, leg-locks, gloves, straps, and straitwaistcoats are as antiquated weapons to use in -the warfare against insanity as bows and arrows are in common war. But, according to this Report, -and according to Mr. E. ELLICE, this is still the main system in use in Scotland. It is indeed aurprising to see how completely a mere arbitrary boundary line stops the advance of an important improvement; and yet Scotland, with its great medical school, is the last country in the world -ahere we ebould have expected such ]arbarisms to be maintained ; for the new treataient of the insane, though a benevolent movement in some degree, is mainly a medical discovery. Scientific men discovered that the old system was a mistake-that madness was not to be met by such remedies; and the new system grew up as any other medical improvement might-such as the new mode of treating fever. As the old established seat, theni, of medical science, why did not Scotland take the lead in this discovery, instead of being, as the fact turns out, the very last even to take advantage of it when it has been made? The institutions called " Cbartered Asylums" in Scotland seem tolerably free from this charge. The Commissioners, indeed, object to the " cage-like" appearance of these structures, which are " en" closed externally by strong wire or light iron" work." They object to their " long galeries " radiating from the central staircase," and recommend " more simple and ordinary buildings for "the poor, having a more domestic aspect and "arrangement." The very sensible language of the Report, indeed, on this point, deserves to be quoted:- " There is little doubt that to be near homne, and to be surrounded with homely objects, in dwellings having a domestic character, and affording opportunities for ordinary daily occupation in household work, by arrangements familiar to them at home, are grateful to the feelings of poor patients, who generaUy prefer an inferior description, of acconmmodation of this kind to the spacious gaUeries provided in some of the pablic asylams. In saoh plain domestic buildings a more contented frame of mind is likely to arise. These appardntly trnlling arrangements assume a degree of ixuportance when it is considered that by recalliog past impregsions, avakening deadened sympathies, and reviving former habits and eustoms, they may become the means of arresting the aberration of a diseased mind and of restoring it to healthy action." These Chartered Asylums use the expedient of seclasion too much; but they appear to have dropped. the coarser weapons of the old system. The " Li" censed Houses," however, retain the old coarse system of instrumental restraint. These are establishments set up by persons as private speculations, and often, as the Commission complains, by unfit persons, the Sheriff not seldom giving licences to men who have no professional knowledge of the subject. The keeper of one of these establishments at Mulsselburgh had been a "victual-dealer,"another had been an " unsuccessful baker," another had been a " gardener," another "a a woman who had " kept a publichouse." Instrumental restraint is in very general use in these houses, and is applied to private patients as well as pauper ones. "There " are houses in which some of the paupers " are kept constantly manacled." The straitwaistcoat is in daily use. " In ahlost every house "we found," say the Commissioners, " handcuffs, "leg-locks, gloves, straps, and straitwaistcoats, " and these not in the custody of the proprietor or "medical attendant, but hanging up in the wards." The Commissioners discovered that the patients were " restrained by means of manacles, fastening "the arms behind the back, and also to rings "fixed in the wall." The seclusion-room comes in as supplementary to this system. " In the "Barony Workhouse a very narrow slit admitted "light and fresh air into three rooms, which were thus close, dark, and offensive." The patient in seclusion lies on a mattress on the floor, or on loose straw covered by a sheet. The sole motive, of course, in setting up these establishments is profit, and " the accommodation " of the greatest possible number at the smallest " outlay" is the great aim. There is consequently overcrowding, with an absence of proper separation of male and female patients. "lMost " of the pauiper houses have no day-rooms, the "patients vwhen not in the airing-grounds occupy"ing their crowvded sleeping-rooms during the "day," and some which have day-rooms hardly furnish them. In very few are there any single rooms for the separation of the epileptic, noisy, or refractory. Even the upper class of patients are often miserably lodged "Two male patients were confined in Hill-end Asylamn, near Greenock; both had occupied respectable positions in life, and the payments made for them were respectively 531. and 351. per annum. At the time of our visit they shared a small bedroom with a third patient, and for months bad slept together, entirely naked, in a miserabletrough bed, upon a quantity of loose straw." The dormitories of these overcrowded establishments are, of course, abominable; and whereas in Lanarkshire the Sheriff had fixed 800 cubic feet of air as the minimum7 allowance for each patient, the allowance in some cases is - only 200, and the average is only 300-and this with hardly ever any arrangement for ventilation other thau the natural outlets of the room afford, and even these not used. "The windows, even in summer, are almost always closed during the night, ana1 "the fireplaces are generally boarded up, so that " ventilation is impossible." Very few of these establishments possess a warm bath, and even the ordinary washing accommodation is exceedingly defective. " Frequently there are no basins, and "the patients wash in tubs, or at the pump; but in some cases it seemed doubtful whether they " washed above once or twice a-week." In Lilybank this tub was placed "in a damp " shed, which served also for the deadhouse." The table linen was often extremely dirty, and in some houses the patients "were served "in their sleeping-rooms, taking their food "in a basin and tearing it with their fingers." These establishm,,nts also are grievously deficient in space, and do not give room for necessary exercise and amusement. Everybody knows what important ingredients these are in the good treatment of insanity, and that the want of them is fatal. Yet the grounds for 60, 70, 80, or 90 patients rarely exceed one acre in extent, while there is seldom any attempt made to provide the moen with any kind of work or amusement. Such is the picture which Mr. E. ELLIcE, relying upon this Report, gives of the present treat. mient of Lunatics in Scotland-a country which, though blest with two Church Establishments, a body of stipendiary Sheriffs, and a judicial Bench cluitc out of proportion to the work it has to discharge, seems to have known nothing of these aboninations. The disclosures of this Report will he received with surprise and indignation by the English public, which has been now so long accastomed to a better system, and which will, we trust, insist on immediate legislation to remove a practico which is ai stain on the character of Scotland and a disgrace to our common humanity.
In all the debates and treatises, in all the active measures and proceedings to which for the last 50 years the Slave Trade has given rise, one weak point of policy wil be invariably discovered. t is negative ratber than positive in its character, involving not so much an error as a shortComing, not so much a mistake as an omission; and yet, for all this, it is little less than fatal in its consequences. Let the reader consider for a moment the principal elements of this great question, which bas led to so many noble saciifices and so many abortive struggles; to so much benevolence and to so rcuch mniscry; to so much charity and to so much strife. The most prominent feature was, of course, the actual traffic in human filesh. On one sids of the Atlantic was a country swarming with a population which its own chiefs exported for use, and which, after unutterable suffering, was landed on the other side to be worked up with less care than is bestowed upon brutes. From the firt capture of the slave in the African village to the final sale of the miserable creature in America, the whole commerce, in every one of its incidents and its results, was so frightful that no language can adequately describe its horrors. To the aboli- tion, therefore, of this detestable trade. the effurts of European Abolitionists were immediately directed. Reciprocal treaties paved the way for proceedings, Government enactments then concurred in denouncing the trafflc, and, finally, measures of forcible repression were adopted to secere compliance with the new law of Europe. By consent in the first instance, by arms in the last resort, but absolutely -and effectuaUy in some way or other, the Slave Trade was to be put down. This is the first element in the case. But to what objects or purposes had the traffic in slaves been directed? After all, nefarious and execrable as this traffic was, it was a traffic still, and the supplies from Africa could only have been based upon a regoular demand. Slaves were only shipped for sale because it was known they would be purchased, and they were only purehased because their labour could be turned to account. On what, then, was this labour employedc? On tropical agriculture,-on the production of sugar, rice, coffee, and other articles of almost the first necessity to European life. Now, be it observed that in this, the ultimate foundation of the Slave Trade -the basis on which the whole superstructure of abominations was raised and supported-there was nothing objectionable whatever. No exception could possibly be taken to the cultivation of those fertile soils from which crops of such utility could be raised. The fruits of the earth are for man's use il one region sof the globe as well as another. There' is no criminality attending the consumption of coffee or sugar, no censure attaching to husbandry in Jamaica or Brazil any more than in Norfolk or Pomerania. The object, therefore, of the Slave Trade-that is to say, the tillage and improvement of the soil-was lawful enougli; the crime was confined to the means by which labourers were attained and the conditions under which they weroe worked-in other words, to the trade itself. From this point of view we observe the second element of the question-viz., thEt the- Slave Trade had maintained a vast system of production, against which, considered apart from the agencies employed, not a word could be said. Looking, then, at the case as involving on one side an extensive and beneficial species of cultivation, and on the other an atrocious traffic in human blood, let us ask what steps were taken when we abolished the evil to provide-for the maintenance of the good. To this question no satisfactory answer can be given, and it is at this point that our policy has failed. Admitting at once that it was our bounden duty as a* Christian people to in.ercept by all the means in our power that dreadful current of misery which for so many years had been setting across the Atlantic, it would surely also have been wise to. concert some effective measures for supplying the' agriculturists of America with other agencies in the place of those which they had lost. Neither we nor they could desire that their avocations should cease altogether. Their fault, or their misfortane, had been, not that they were farmers, but that they farmed by means of slaves. IR could not be expected either that Europeans would dispense with the importations they had been in the habit Ofi enjoying, or that Americans would quietly see their lands run to waste; and yet these were the conditions which we seemed to be assuming. Instead of facilitating the introduction of some substitute for the labour abstracted, we regarded with the utmost jealousy every effort directed to this end, and were so nervously apprehensive about the continuance of slavery under any kind of disguise that we placed a kind of prohibition upon any labour whatever. That such a state of things was perfectly incompatible with tranquillity, content, or good faith in the execution of agreements, the smallest knowledge of human nature should have sufficed to teach us., We had, left a large class of agricultmrists, hitherto engaged in, remunerative. production, without the means byg which such production could be carried on. AU this while we had no design of proscribing the production itself, but desired, on the contrary, that it should be stimulated and improved as far as possible. We wanted sugar, coffee, rice, and other tropical exports in constantly increasing quantities; and what, then, were planters to do ? Naturally, they struggled as hard as they could against the interdict which had beea issued. In the West Irdies, being British territories, they had no chance, and when a few schemes of apprenticeship, &c., had been tried and failed the worst actuaLy came to the worst, and estates went out of cultivation altogether. In other countries the Governments, as was to be anticipated, reflected, as far as they could venture to do £o, the dissatisfaction of their subjects, and strove, with more or less success, to leave loopholes for a traffic which theywere solemnly engagedto putdown. Then came the measures for snppressing this most dreadful of aU kinds of smuggling-and with consequences injurious to all parties alike. Bad as the Slave Trade had always been, a contraband Slave Trade proved something worse than ever. The horrors of the middle passage were doubled through the expedients adopted to avoid the cruiser3; the questions arising between preventive vessels and other vessels were perpetually threateniag international conflict, and the police of an immense ocean sorely taxed the patience and the purses of those who supported it. At length, after 40 years of incessant efforts, measures of repression have so far succeeded that nine-tenths of the contraband traffic may be c.nsidered as stopped ; but under what conditions ? lWhy, the whole gist of the debate on Thursday evening was that our success was only just commensurate with our coercion, that as long as we held the serew tight we might reckon on security, but no longer ; that the Slave Trade, as Lord PALiaRsToNo phrased it, was "not extinguished " in the hearts' of the planters; and that, in point of fact, we were just where we used to be, except in so far as violence, or threats of violence, had produced, nob abandonment, but suspension of wrong. Who can wonder at this? or who can expect that such ideas will cease until a substitute has been found for something which was indispensable, and which has been taken away? Here is the weak point of our policy. Instead of endeavouring to destroy the hankering after slaves by the importation of more lawful labour, we mercly abolished one agency without thinking about another. We intercepted a supply, but' left an active and powerful demand-a demand which we our. selves conurred- in 'stimulating. Very possibly the employment of slaves, like all vicious practices, might have produced some positive preference for the evil; but this must soon have vanished with a state of things providing equal opportunities for enterprise in a better form. As a matter of calculation, indeed, slave labour is not cheap labour, but, as we left things, it was that or none; so that the impulse of evil habits conspired with necessity itself in keeping people on the wrong trae'k. To make the abolition of the Slave Trade an accomplished and an accepted fact slaves should have been rendered useless in the plantations, and therefore worthless in the market. If population was to find its level and labour its price, this coul'd be done as well by importing freemen as bondsmen. We know for certain that there are quarters of the globe so overpopulated that the exportation of labourers would be beneficial to all parties, and as we did not wish to put down sugar-growing, but merely slave-holding, these were the quarters where our true resource was to have been found. We do not think the work would have been, difficult, if this part of the question had onlT hseu handlea 'wt the same Tigour asawas applied to the other. A compara' tively small amount of labour will make all the difference between a surplus and a, deficiency, and if a supply of this kind had been substituted for that which was so righteously abolished. Brazil might have been now above suspicion, aud our own West Indies as flourishing as ever.
IRELAND. THE NEW CHIEF SECRBTAY. (PrOM OUR OWN COnRSPOWMnnw'v. DUBLIN. FRIDAY MORN,Tl- The conlirtnation of the appointment of MIr. HenryArthur Herbert has given general satisfaction. Of his re-election for Kerry without a contest there is not a shadow of a doubt. Apropos of the Irish Secretaryship, it may here be mentioned that-vhen the rumour of Mr. Bernal Osborne's acceptance of the office was first bruited a most unjust cry was raised against him by the Frmeenan's Journa, which, by some unaccountable miseonception of' facts, charged him with having, in the course of a speseh delivered six years back inthe debate upon the abolition of the Irish Viceroyalty, made some insulting remarks upon the conduct of the lady ,isitora at the Castle festivities. Never was charge more bpseless. The vety reverse was the truth. After the publication of the attack upon Mr. Osborne the EvenibW -Post promptly took up hisdefenee, and showed from, the printed reports of the- speech in question; that Mr. Osborne, so far from speakiZg disparagingly of the Irishuladies, tock occasion to censure the toGne of a paragraph containing the offensivealltusions, which: appeared in another Dublin journal, and which was. referred to by MIr. Osborne as an iUustration of the* asperities of party in connexion e7en with the hostitalitiea of Dublin Castle. A correspondent. of the Evening Post, repelling the attacks of the Freemnux upola Mr. Osborne, says:- "Eeeling fully convinced that he was wholly incapable, under any eircumstances, of feeling or giving utterance to the sentiments or language imputed to him, and that your contemporary munst have wvitten under a great mistake, forgetfulness, or misconception, I have ta-ken the trouble to examine in Han8ard the report of the speech in question and I was not surprised to find, though others may be surprised tohear,th tin the speech,. from beginning to end,. there is nothing wbatever to Justify the aceusation, nor any language -usedby Mr. Osborne of the character ascribed to him.. l have also consulted thereporaof lM.0sborne's speech in Ahe Times andDublin Eveninst) Mail, in neither of whicha: is there a particle of foundation for the charges against Mr. Osborne. The speech wi be found in Hansard? R2 rts, vol. IlP, Ipe 202, debate of 17th of May, 1852; and on reference it will le seen that Mr. Osborne, speaking of and deprecating the violence of party feeling at-that time in Ireland, and the attacks of thie press certain to be made on any neowLo idLieutenantt and giving instances, goes on to say-' And even the laes dinot escape.' Xs an instance of the virmlence of this party feeling, ho read an article from the Dublin Evening Alail, deocribing St. Patrick's ball. For aU the slander and aspersion in that aticle let the authors of it, and them alone, answer. The languege was not Mr. Osborne's, nor was-it adopted by him, or used, as stated, in any other manner than above mentioned; and I fully and entirdy believe, from his long and intimate knowledge of Irishsociety, he vwould be the last man to entertain or instinuate any sentiment derogatory to the virtue, purity, or correctness of conduct of thebldies of Ireland." HARVEST PROSPECTS. From the comnmencement of the week the weather has been most' favourable for agrictltural purpose, and although the wind seems permanently fixed at east the heat of the sun out' of the shade is very hreat, the glass yesterday forenoon standing at 93. The Cork Reporter has the following satisfactory statement with regard to the prospects in that extensive district " The agricultural operations in this part of the country have been carried on with such eagerness and unceasing exertions that almost all kinas of spring crops are now sown, and the appearance presented, especiaUy since the timely rain of tho past, week has visited us, is most cheering to the fartuer, who sees in the healthy look of the thriving potato stalk with which the fields are at pre. sfDt green tn all the surrounding districts, as well as'in the nc-t less promising fields of corn, the guarantee of a fruitful and an abundant harvest, which shall amply repay him for al his toil and anxiety. Therains which have lately fallen have brought with them the genial heat of a snmmer su, and these combined are forcing on vegotation with almost visible velocity. Tho entire face of the country looks refheshed and beautiful, the trees have increased their foliage, prezentinga pleasing contrast with what theyappeareda short time ago, and all nature has renewed its yonth, so that even' the aged of mankind almost feel themselves returning to the spring of life again when they behold the change around them. Butif allthis gives promise of a bounteous! i-crease in the coming autumn, and as we have said, is caloulated to cheer the farmer,; should It not also bring consolation to the poor, especially of our cities, to whom the p?esentprice ofprovssionsisa matter of - soine importance, and who can hardly look for any chango until the newv crop is fit for the miarket? Surely it ought, and there can scarcely be a doubt but, with the now cropg, prices will come down so as to plice the necessaries of life more within' the reachof ourpoorer population than they are at present."

FORBIGN INTELLIGENCB. - - JEANCE. (YBOM OUR OWN OORRUPONDMU.) (A po.-tIon of the following appeared in our secondeditiout ef -stArdiv !-1 FARS, THURSDAY, MAY 28, 6 P.aL 'Tho Republican party, it appears, has decided on putting forth a certain number of candidates at the approaching elections in Paris. These candidates belong to what used to be called the Bltes, or moderate Republicans, and are General Cavaignac, MM. Havin, (loudchaux, Marie, Bethmont, Lasteyrie, Caraot, Gervais (de Caen), and Garnier Pages, several of whom were members of the Provisional Go vernment in 1848. M. Gamier Pags wiU also be proposed at Valenciennes and Douay, ML Jules Favre and Dr. Henin at Lyons, and M. Maillard, who, I believe, was formerly secretary to M. Ledru Rollin, in the department of the Correze. It is not said whether all or any will, in case of election, take the oath of allegiance to the Emperor. It will be curious to observe the effect produced on theParisian population when such namea are put before it after so long a period of repose. Of the success of the movement it would be hazardous to say anything, as the Government will probably do their best to keep the doors of the LeAgislative Chamber shut in the face of men like Cavaignac, Carnot, and Lasteyrie. As yet no animation, no interest in the elections is visible, and unless such a astimulus as this prevail the apthy promises to remain the same to the end. Mhere there is no un.certainty as to the result people do not think it worth while to break the tranquility of their every-day existence. Under any circumstances, I doubt whether there will be more than a score of new members in the next Chamber. Five or six may be promoted to other posts, placed in the half-way stage of the Council of State, or flung up into the Paradiso of the Senate. As many more may be pre'vented by business or ill-health from returning to the Chamber. About the same number of incapables-men useless to Emperor or country-regular "chips in porridge"-of whom even the Emperor himself is tired, may be flung aside. A few may get in on the " Opposition interest" without any positive interference on the part of the authorities. I should be surprised if the changes were more, but it is not improbable that more opposition will be manifested in the next Chamber than in the present: I believe that there are severalGovernment measures which it would not vote were it not on the eve of dissolution. While the French journals only criticize with fear and trembling the acts of the home Government, they take great liberty in discussing the merits, or demerits, of the Moldo-Wallachian Administration, and in denouncing the conduct of the opponents of the Union; and while the Mhisterial press is recommended to observe absolute silence on the French elections, now so near at hand, and on the acts of the autholities, it may expend any amount of indignation against the Moldavian agents, who, supposing all to be true which is alleged of them, do no more than imitate imperfectly the example set them by the Imperial Government of France. The columns of these journals have been for some time past filled writh communications from Jassy and Constantinople, condemning the arbitrary conduct of the Kaimakan of Moldavia. TUhe Monvite'r itself, which only two days ago inSiicted chastisement on the,Tourad des CJheminm de Fer for a criticism on certain financial measures of the Government, has the hardihood to forget its official gravity, and to descend, like any vulgar organ of the public, into the arena of politics. Utterly regardless of what passes before its own eyes, it thunders against Prince Vogorides, the Kaimakan of Moldavia, as if he were the greatest criminal on earth. The crime of Vogorides consists in his being the partisan of the separation of the Principalities. In these views he may be riglht or wrong, but at least he is entitled to his opinion quite as much as Md. de Talleyrand, the French Commissioner, is justified in his opposition. M. Vogorides has, at all events, the meritof acting frankly and openly, and the same energy which the agents of power in France are employing to secure a Chamber that shall be like the p resent he exhibits in his peculiar vocation. If he has committed illegality, of which there is only French evidence, the organ of the Imperial Government should be the very last to reproach him, for the Kaimakan believes that in resisting the Union and directing the elections he takes as his model the Emperor of the French. Like him, he repressesthe " revolutionary spirit." It is rather curious that the French Government, which at home energetically and so successfully opposes every manifestation of public spirit or political agitation in every corner of the French empire, and so vigorously removes everypretextfordisturbingpublic tranquillity,makes common cause with the agitator of Jassy, and attacks through its repreeentative at Constantinople a functionary who can be only reproached by his superiors with exhibi a little too much zeal in defending the interests of the Sublime Porte. It is reported that a telegraphic despatch has been received from Constantinople, announcing that, as thePortehas not dismissed PrinceVogorides from his post of Eaimakan of Moldavia, as demanded by M. de Thouvenel, the French, Russian, Prussian, and Sardinian Commissioners have signified to the Government that they wiUl quit the Principalities unless the demand of the French Ambassador is immediately complied with. A private letter from Toulon contains some details respecting the steam frigate Audacieuse, which has jus sailed for China. The frigate is only to touch at Senegal and at the Cape of Good Hope. She carries coal for eight days, so that she may steam over that portion of the passage where sailing ships are detained by light winds, and which comprises a distence of from 2CO to 250 marine leagues. This is the first screw frigate which has been despatchedto the Indian seas. As the Audacieuse is a frigate of great speed, she may beexpected to perform the passage to Singapore in 75 days, where Baron Gros will meet Lord Elgin, who has gone by Suez. A letter from Madrid announces that orders had been transmitted to the Governor-General of the Philippines, in anticipation of the events to take place in China. According to those orders a shipof-war attached to that Spanish colony is to be placed at the orders of the Spanish Consul at Macao. 'The colony will, moreover, place stores of all kinds at the disposal of the British and French ships-ofwar. The measures adopted by the Spanish Government on this occasion are the more useful as Manilla affords many resources, and is at a reasonable distance from the coast of the Celestial Empire, which is to be the theatre of the approaching operations. I am informed that the arrangement of the differences between the Spanish and Mexican Governmnents, which had been in a fair way to a conclusion, have encountered fresh difficulties. The negotiations are continued, but Senor Lafragua has not yet been received by the Queen. Intelligence has reached Paris of the arrival at Cherbourg of the Admiralty yacht Osborne, from England, and that the Grand Dukej Constantine was hourly expected in that pert. The report of M. Devinck on the bill for renewing the charter of the Bank of France gives an account of all the discussions which have taken place in the committee on each of the articles of the bill. The modifications adopted by the committee, and which have led to a new wording of the bill, are the following-- The first bears onthe form of the wording as regards the Rente to be transferred to the Bank of F rance; the second relates to the price of that Rents, which will be no longer fixed on beforehand, but according to the average price of the month preceding the payment; that price, however, cannot be below 7Sf. It is known that according to the Government measure the Rente was to be transferred at the price of 75f.:- " We found," says M. Devinek, " that that quotation was not high enough; in fact, the price of the Three per Cents. less than a year ago was 76f.; it was at 86f. after the cotlp Vdtat; and no one ought at this moment, when France, by the wisdom and energy of her Government, has just acquired a political grandeur vwhich places her in the first rank, and when the riches of the country manifest themselves by an inrea8e in the public revenue which exceeds aU calculations, to admit for our Three per Cents, a price of 75f., wbich would in some measure form a limit for the price of publio seourities." The third modification has for its object to replace tIe power of charging a commission by an advance in the rate of discount in certain exceptional oircumstances. It appeared to the committee difficult to fix a commission to be graduated in proportion to le number of days which the bills would have to "If it were to be so," says tho report, "that right of comnmssion, whioh woulad become an annual duty, would in reality be a rise in the rate of discount." The object of the fourth modification is to cause to be paid into the funds of the Bank, and in augmentation of those funds, the result of a rise in the rate of discount. The fifth authorizes the issue of bank-notes of 50f. This amendment, which is accepted by the Council of State, is thus explained by M. Devinck:- " It has for its object to permit a humble economizer to store up his savings in a bank-note, instead of in specie, by which means that amount of specie would naturally fnd its wayback to the coffers of theBank of France. Itis,therefore to increase indirectly the quantity of specie which is nocessary for circulation. It is besides to put into circulation all the specie which will be exchanged against 50s. notes; it is, lastly, a facility given to workmen and employds wishing to send a sum of 50. to their families, and who are now compelled to send It in specie or in a post-office order." Two other modifications impose-one, the obligation for the Bank to establish within the delay of ten years branch establishments in all the departments where they do not now exisbt ; and the other, the reduction to three per cent. of the rate of interest eharged on the account-current of the Treasury. In the creation of fresh branch establishments the committee sees a means of promoting the circulation of capital and " of bringing dowrn the rate of in- terest, by attracting towards the coffers of the bank | specie, of which it can readily make a more useful distribution." An eighth modification wasi warmly advocated by the committee, but was rejected by the Council of State. It related to the power given to the Government to modify its concession after a period of 20 years:- "The majority of the committee," says M. Devinck, "has not changod its opinion on this pointk but has retained its firm conviction that the Governent is wrong in not reserving to itself this means of foresight." " But," he adds, in conclusion, "in presence of the considerable improvements which are ntroduced into the concession of the privilege of the bank, it proposes to you the adoption of the bill."

Since the frosts of winter left us positively and definitively for the last time, after having apparently taken leave of us a good many times before, the works have been resumed with great activity at the " Palace of the old King," rearranging, enlarging, embellishing, almost rebuilding it for the future Crown Prince of Prussia and his EngL?sh bride, the Princes Royal. Every traveller who has visited Berliu will recolleet the " old King's Palace," as it is popularly called, opposite the Zeughaus, or Arsenal, a heavy, tasteless pile of building, which constituted almost an eyesore in the circle of interesting buildings that surround the Opern Platz. Its value and interest, however, to the Prussian are, that there the idolized Queen Louisa lived, the old King lived and died, the present King and all his Royal brothers were born, and to that palace it was that the late King and Queen returned in 1808, when the conclusion of the Treaty of Tilsit had procured the evacuation of thecapital by the French. This Palace is about to become one of the greatest ornaments of the town, and an appropriate completion of the most interesting area in Berlin. While it retains its claim on the affectionate recollections of the past, it will form the focus of Prussia's hopeful expectation for the future, for the young Prince is fully as popular in Prusia as heirs apparent and presumptive generally are in the land of their expectancy, and his approaching marriage with the Princess Royal is of a nature materially to strengthon that feeling. The King has acted in this whole affair of the Palace with the greatest liberality; he has not only asigned 350,000 thalers (between 50,0001. and 60,0001.) for the alteration, enlargement, embellishment, and furnishing it, but has also left the young Prince full freedom to carry out the designs and plans that have been thought most conducive to his future domestic comfort. These plans, which are now in course of execution, have, as I shrewdly suspect, already travelled to England, for they bear the impress of English tastes and domestic habits, and differ in some important respects from the prevailing arrangements of gentlemen's seats in Prussia, and still more from those of the Royal Palaces. It is usual, as far as I have seen, in large houses and palaces for the master and mistress of the house to have each an entire suite of rooms, apart from the other, pretty much as though they were living together, but separated, and met only at dinner or in company; these two suites of rooms, moreover, are generally on separate floors. ID this Palace, however, the separation takes place, not between man and wife, but between what is official and what is domestic; the ground-floor being devoted to the official business connected with thePriinces station and military rank, and the upper part of the Palace to privacy and the most intimate domesticity. The building, as it has hitllerto consisted, was composed of a single corps de los of two stories high, with an unbroken facade; by the addition of a third story to a portion of the front (which story will, however, for the first few year1 remain in reserve), the building is made to consist of a centre and wings ; a noble Corinthian portico is to be thrown out from the centre to form a covered carriage approach, and along the front of the eastern wing there will run a colonnade, supporting a trellicework for creeping plants and flowering shrubs to be trained on. The apartments destined for the Princess'sprivate use are both cheerful and comfortable; they lie on the first floor at the west side of the Palace, and the windows look on to that brilliant little panorama of whichI have spoken above as containing almost all that is interesting in Berlin. In front is theZeughaams, or Arsenal, and progreesing westwards the eye lights on the elegant Kdnigswache, the chief guardhouse of the city, flanked by the statues of Scharnhorst an i aniln - acie by- a_ rihgoeo an lw , and backel by a rich grove of chestnuts. Then follow the University, the Academy of Arts and Sciences, Rauch's splended equestrian statue of Frederick the Great, with the avenue of lindens and chestnut trees stretching thence nearly a mile in length to the Brandenburger Thor, then the Prince of Prussia's Palace, the tasteful Operat house, the bronze statues of Blucher, York, aa Gneisenau, and the palace of the Princess Liegnitz, the late King's second and morganatic wife.. Be: tween this last Palace and that of t-he young Prince and Princess there runs a street, but a connecting gallery was thrown over it in the time of the late King, as a means of communication between the two households; that gallery is now retained for the Princess's private use, its issue into the Princess Liegnitz's Palace having been bricked up, and thus it forms a light and airy room, looking up and down the street, like the room ever Temple-bar. The Prince's rooms are on the same floor, at the east side of the building, and look over the Commndandarnt (the residence of the military commander of Berlin), across the Schloa-brucke, with its groups of white marble, to the Royal Schloss, the Cathedral, the Museum, t'he Lust-garten, round to the A rsenal In front, so that there is very little worth seeing in Berlin t-hat is not visible from the young couple's apartments. These roDms, which occupy the whole range of the front, are eonnM ki with each other by a corridor running along at the back of the2 so that communication can be kept up between both extremes without necessarily passing through the apartments occupied by the Ladies and gentlemen in waiting. The S3tate I apartments occupy the whole east side of the Palace stretching in one unbroken suite from the front to the back, towards the south. A similar range of Tooms on the west side of the Palace is devoted to sleeping, dressing, and bathrooms, and to the accommoation of the household attached to the person of the Princess. The rooms occupied by the late Eing, and which up to the commencement of these alterations had always remained intact, wlll still be retainel in the Palace, when completed for its new occupants. Those on the groundfloor will even contain the identical furniture he used, and in exactly the order in whaich he left it, but those on the floor, consisting of but three rooms, will retain only the form aud decorations of the walls, but will be denuded of their furniture, so that they will always be available for use. These three rooms are,-1, the room in which the old King died; 2, the favourite sitting-room of Queen Louisa; and, 3, the chapol which the King had arranged for himself when he was prevented leaving his apartments from having broken his leg by a fall. The skiU which has been exhibited ia procuring the necessary accommodation and arrangement of the rooms for the wants of the young couple, and at the same tims in retaining what is sacred to the memory of the late King without interfering with their eomforts, reflects the greatest crediton Professor Strack, the architect who has been intrusted by the young Prince with the designing and conduct of the building; the difficulties of thus reconciling the requirements of the past, thepresent, and the future in ona building have been certainlyincomparably greater than in designing a plan for a palace to be built for a given number o pono on a plot of totaJly unoccupied ground. lhe eatire a meats esn to be pervaded by a sound and who esome sense of what is suitable and sanitary; what is good and desirable in English internal arrangement is associated with what is elegant and tasteful In Prussian external architecture. Thus the Palace will be thoroughly and amply supplied with every water convenience and contrivance (as yet all but unknown in Prussia) ; with gas, for illumination all over the building; with warm air, for heating; thopen fireplaces and other appliances for warmin an ventilaon. The open paralelogrm left betwveen the main comps de logzs in front and the two long sides of the Palace is to be laid out as a garden, with plenty of grassplot and flowering shrubs and statuary intenningled. As its aspect is south the whole of the back of the building derives from it a cleerful, airy, and healthy appearance. The stables and coachhouses are situated at the furthest end of tbis parallelogram, about 150 yards from the private apartments, and, asthemewn opens out into side streets at both ends, the noise and other nuisances connected with stables will ba kept entirely aloof. AlR the stone, and even the marble used in the building, will be the produce of Prussian quarries; and all the fitting-up and furniture will as far as possible be of Prussin manufacture, at the young Prince's own especial desire. When one sees that the stables are being erected for 50 horses, and thinks of the numerous household that will be accommodated within the rooms now in process of erection, the usual apanage of a Prussian Prince, which, as I lately stated, is only 40,000 thalers (6,0001.), seems rather inadequate. In the case of Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, however, the allowance will probably be larger than this sum; though he is neither Crown Prince nor heir presumptive to the throne (that is what his father 1S), he is at any rate the second nearest Prince to the throne, and in all human probability will eventually succeed to the crown. Whenever, therefore, the point comes to be maooted at this Court, there is no doubt that these circamstances will be duly considered, and the usual allowance extended by the King to either 9,0001. Or 12,0001. AUSTRIA (MONx OUR OW OWNO lPONDxT.) VNIE-A, MAr 26. The Ost-Deutsche Post of this morning contains the following communication, which emanates evidently from the Government:- "1 A number of k Tim7es contains a Vienna lettein which it is mad that the Primate of Hungary has presented to lis Majesty the Emperor a petition bearing the signatures of 200 Hungarian magnater, and containing the exprewlon of the wishes and wants of the country. As the news oontalned In 2Vze Time has also been given in several German papers, we have thought it advisable to examine Into the matter more closely. " Talleyrand used to say,-' What is known to more than two persons Is no longer a dlplomatic secret ;' and we therefore thought there could be no great difficulty in getting at the truth of a matter known to 200 orc-acording to the ANord--0 persons. Our own investigtions, oombined with information acquired at pefectly credible sources, enable us to assert that no petition of the kind described was presented (eberreia) to HiS Majesty from the time of his arrival up to his departure this morning. " If a petitlon-which, as has besan said, was positively not presented-was ever intended, the idea originated with a certain party, and not with the Hungarin nobility. "In the meantime, the Empero has granted an amnesty, aad displayed a clemency of which there is no second example in Europe, He has healed the still gaping wounds of a sad past, and prepared a happy future for this country. " Pestb, May 23." Either the high employgs in Hungary are marvellously ill-informed of what is pasing around them, or the writer of the foregoing article takes advantage of the double sense of the word ibreien. Strictly speaking, iibe7reichen is "to present " t; hand over," but it may also be understood to meaa that the object presented is accepted. If in the foregoing letter the word is used in the first sense, the writer is altogether wrong; if in the last, his statement is perfectly correct. As has been 5m5A in more than one of my lettes, the Emperor declined to accept the petition which the Primate of Hungary was deputed by the magnates to put into his hands. Most of the Hungarian nobles are now in this city, and very discontented and downc2st they appear to be. My recent assertion that His Majesty cannot make the political concemions required of him has greatlydisgusted the leaders of the ultra-Conservative party, and my statement that the discontent which prevails iu Hungary is principally to be attributed to the injudicious and arbitrary conduct of the employis is said to have much annoyed and displeased the provincial Government. Reliable private letters have not yet been received from elther JaszBereny or Szegedin, but the official reports are that their Majesties are received with great enthusiasm. An account has to-day been given me of the way in which Count Radetzky broke his leg. Countess Wallmoden called to take leave of the Marshal, and when she was about to leave the room he rose from his chair, and insisted on accompanying her tothe door. The Countes stronglyprotested against his doig so, and, having made him resume his seat, she hurried out of the room. It is supposed that the old gentleman's politeness induced him to rise again as soon asthe Countess's back was turned, for before she was out of the ante-room she and the servant in attendance heard a heavy fall. On returning she found the poor old man lying on the floor with a broken thigh. The patient, who suffers very little pain, is in good spirits, but laments that his departure for Monza must be delayed " for at least six weeks.' The prevalent opinion in medical circles is that no attempt has been made to set the bone. His Majesty has agreed to the enlargement of the inner city 'i princple, and Baron Bach has received orders to take the matter into immediate consideration. The first regular consultation on th$ subject was held at the Ministry of the Interior yesterday. I am glad to say that the huge barracks on the ramparts facing the Leopoldstadt are as displesing to the eyes of the Emperor as to those of every one else. Never was a greater architectural blunder committed than the erection of such an edifice on such a spot. The picturesque appearance of a part of the ancient city is destroyed, tho handsome Francis Joseph'a Gate has been made to look like a stone mousetrap, and the communication between the city and the Custom-house by meaus of a wide straight street has been rendered impos3ible. "I If," said Mis Majesty some time ago, "I could have foreseen that the barracks would so disfigure the city, they shouldhave been built elsewhere.' ITALY. A letter from Rome, of the 20th i:nt., ttea that as yet the journey of the Pope through his States has not given rise to any remarkable incident. The Municipal Councils of the towns through which Elis Holiness had pased had ucceeded in concealig from their Sovereign the whes of the population. It is said that Mondgnor Borromeo rwas particularly charged by Cardinal Antonelli to prevent any sUch msnifestations, and he has skilFully performed his part. It is believed, however, that this system of concealment caunot be maintained when Pius VIL visits the Legations. Captain Azzanessi, Commander of the 4th company of Chasseir, which fo'rms the garrison of the castle and State prison of Pagliano, had arrived at Rome. This officer obtained a certain notoriety by his severity at all times to the State prisoners, but particularly during the late attempt made by them to escape. Among other facts it is mentioned that he caused the head of a political prisoner named Roselli, brother of General Roselli to be shaved and ordered that he should be loaded with chains: because he reminded the captain that he was under his orders in the year 1848. The announcement of the suicide of a political prisoner named Romiti, in the castle of Pagliano, caused a painful sensation in Rome. The unfortunate man had many friends, and was greatly regretted. lIe was drivento commit the rash act by the severities to which he was subjected. There are two other political prisoners, MM. Gulinelli and Dodati, at Pagliano, whose period of imprisonment has expired, and in any other Christian country their discharge would be considered certain, but it is not so in the Roman States. The writer concludes by observing that the Count de Rayneval might write another despatch on the execution of the laws in the Roman States. A letter from Rome, in the Cologne Cazeue, announces that the poor classes of the Eternal Cityhave received a practical illustration of the fallibility of human calculations. Shortly before the arrival of the Empress D)owager of Russia the MIont de Piete of Rome transacted an enormous amount of business, as the poor inhabitants thronged to that establishment and pawned their clothes and other petty articles with the idea that they would be all redeemed by the Empress. Their expectations have not been realized, but the Empress replied favourably to 600 petitons for asistance addressed to her. RUSSIA. The official Gazette of Warsaw publishes an Imperial ukase, Igned by the Emperor Alexander, and dated St. Petersburg the 17th (29th) April, 1857. After referring to the Imperial ukase of the 27th May, 1856, which granted an amnesty to those Polish emigrants who had acknowledged their erros and applied for leave to return to Poland, the present ukase restores to all political emigrants the rights of their class of which they had been deprived, provided they had taken advantage of the ukae of 1856, and had returned to Poland before the present Emperor's coronation. The presentukaseissimplyanuamplification of the ukase of 1856, and a call to Polish emigrants to avail themselves of the Emperor's clemency, whereupon they will be restored to their rights and privileges, without claim, however, to the property they possessed before they emigrated.
STATB OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, lXE&Y 29. There was more or less demand for cloth suitable both to home and foreign markets, but it was on a very limited scale, andl there has been no improvement worthy of remark since Tuesday. Sellers, with very few exceptions, held to last prics with much firmness, but there is sufficient pressure on the market, owing to accumulation of stocks, to enablo bayers to gain some slight advantage. This is the case in longCloths, T cloths, and printers' shirtings, and most inds of fabrics in which demand falls short of production. In yams there is notmuch change from Tuesday, when prices were id. per lb. lower than in the previous week. En some cases buyers have been able to purchasetstill rather easier prices, and there Is some irreglarity in the quotations of spinners. 16'a to 24's water twist are rather firmer than most other kinds, but the demand in several kinds of yarns has scarcely been sufficient fairly to test prices. The short-time movement has made some little progress since the commencement of the week. At a meeting heldinStockport by firma representing seveneighths of thehorsepower in thattownitwrasareedon Thursday to work attheratsof4O hoursperweekonly, foramouth from the Ist of June. It has already been mentioned that Burnley and Bacup are working the same number of hours for three months to come, and, considering the large quantity of cloth produced in those towns, the movement is one which will tell very considerably in reducing the over pressure on the market. Manchester itself some time slnce adopted the short-time movement, but the attempt at Preston has failed, and after some discussion upon the question, on Thursday, the subject was adjourned forafortnyht, sothatthelimitation of productionduring themonthof une of cloths suited to China, which are largey produced in that town, is not probable to any exteut. An attempt at Black. burn to induce a resort to similar limitation of hounrs of working has also met with little encouragement. At Rochde and Oldhan some of 16 mills were going upon short time, and in most of tho towias of the district, even where a general movement has not sucoeeded, individual firmshave adopted some restriction. In addition to the manufacturer who is stated to have stopped payment on Tsaeday, two small Greek houses in the Manchester trade have suspended, but their liabilities will probably not be over 2O,wuM together.

THE VINTAG w PRAoE.-The Moniteur Vinicole says:-The beat whichprevailedsome days ago has of late been considerably mod'med by the storms and by the rain, a good quantity of which has faUen and proved most salatary. Our accounts of the appearance of the viiieyards vould have been perfectly satisfactory were it not that we have to mention that the oidium has shown itself in some parts of the Meurthe, the EIrault, and the Bordelai, Fortunately, on all the points where this scoure has appeared, the application of sulphur is practised with such energy as to remove every cause for uneasiness. Wines are wlm, without any fresh advance in quota. tions, but without reduction. Nevertheless, the nropriators and holders now accept prices which the' refused a few days ago. Brandies have not much varled but prices have slightly given way in the markets of Snrgares and La Rochelle.

MONEY-MABKBTaildOrTYIN2'ELL.TGBArog. -Friday Eve1n The funds have been inactive to-day at the prices to which they receded yesterday afternoon on the news from China. Consols for money were first quoted 93i, and, after having touched 930, they closed at 93* for money and 93i for the 4th of June. For the new account on the 9th of July the laBt transactions were at 94* (or 93 ex dividend). In the early part of the day loans upon Government securities were in demand at 7 per cent., but subsequentlythe rate was 6i per cent. The Government broker did not make any further purchaso of Erchequer-bills, and it is therefore assumed that his operations for the savings-banks are now completed. The total of Exehequer-bills bought byhim isince the 8th inst. amount to 540,0001. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92k to #; New Three per Cents., 921 to i; India Stock, 220 to 222; Inddi Bonds, 7a. to 4s. discount; 3Exchequer Bonds, 98k to 99; and Exchequer-bills, June, 2s. to 4s. premium; Mlarch, 5s. to 7s. premium. Foreign securities opened with firmness, but there was subsequently a slight decline. In Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, the transactions were at 95, 94q, and J. The general business comprisedBrazilan Five per Cents., 100I; Buenos Ayres, for account, 86i; Danish Theeper Cents. 84 and 85; Provisional Land Warrant, 3 -; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 7q ; Russian Five per Cents., 107*; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97 and 98; Venezuela, 36*; and Dutch Four per Cents., C3ertificate., 97. The corn-market was again firm this morning, and a further advance of between s,1 and 2s. was m some instances realised. Tho report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a limited business, at dull priCes In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates for Arnsterdanm, Hamburg, and Paris were a ehade lower than last post. The final quotations of the French Throe per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 30c. formoney and 69£ 20c. for theendof the month, showing a recovery of an eighth. According to the advices from Paris to-day it appears that the amended measure for prolonging the privileges of the Bank of France provides that the price at which the Bank are to take the 4,000,0001. of Three per Cent. Rentes that are to be issued from time to time to represent their new capital is to be regulated by the average quotations of the month preceding the delivery of the stock, instead of being fixed at 75, as was at first contemplated. In no case, hoWvTer, is the price to be below 75. Another modification, and one of a satisfactory character, is that the Bank are to be allowed under certain circurnatances to advance their rate of discount beyond 6 per cent. in a direct manner, instead of by charging a commission. It is also stipulated that the Bank shall establish branches in all the departments where they do not already exist, and that the rate for advances to the Treasury is not to exceed 3 per cent. Finally, the most important among the new arrangements is the privilege of issuing MSf. notes. The professed aim of this step is to economize specie, and cause it " to find its way back to the coffers of the Barle'-so that it may "increase indirectly the quantity of specie which is necessary for circulation." By setting freea certain amount at present in use in France it will increase the quantity of specie available throughout the world; but if the French financiers imagine it will permanently increase the supply in France relatively to other countries they are under a delusion. It is true that the first effect of the issue will be to augment the circulation, but this augmentation will be followed by a rise in prices which will operate on the exchanges by attracting foreign commodities, and result in a proportionate drain of bullion. This drain must continue until the aggregate note and specie circulation is brought back to it1 former limit, and then the only difference will consist in the circumstance of this aggregate being composed of a larger amount of paper and a smaller amount of bullion than is at present the case. The resolution, however, is not necessarily dangerous or unsound, since if the population prefer 60f. notes to gold a diminished supply of the latter will suffice. Some private telegraphic despatches from China quote rates of exchange from Hongkong and Shanghai even more unfavourable than those announced in Tie Times. At Hongkong it is alleged to have been 5s. id., and at Shanghai 7s. 5d. The demand for silver, however, in this market has been scarcely so great as was apprehended, ahijpers probably being rendered cautious by the know edge of the large quantities already sent. Although the presentadvices have caused great heaviness in the stock-markets, it must be borne in mind that they do not intrinsically alter our position or prospects. We can only pay once for the Chinese silk crop, and if we transmit large sums thus early, we shal pro, portionably diminish the amounts to be sent at a later date. A circular of M. Arles Dufour, of Lyons, dated the 27th inst., gives a summary of the intelligence thus far received of the progress of the silk crop in Europe and Asia. In Naples and Spain, after a very satifactory commencement, the disease showed itself between the third and fourth stage with such Intensity thatnot more than half a crop is expected. From Sicily and Calabria, on the other hand, the news is very favourable. In Lombardy and Piedmont the crop is unusually late, the worms being only between the first and second stage; and no opinion can yet be formed. ln France it appears that in the forward districts, where the beginning was most hopeful, a great deficiency is now anticipated, the symptoms being the same as those at Naples and in Spain. From the lIevant aUlthe accounts are encouraging, and the crop is expected to be as good, if not better, than the last. M. Arles Dufour adds that the recent advices from China, announcing higher quotations for silk than those which have been reached on this side, have had no influence on the Lyons market, which remains very dull, the general consumption being greatly affected by the existing prices. In the produce-markets during the week the transactions generally have been upon a limited scale. The recovery in sagar noticed last Friday has been followed by a renewed faU of Is., excepting for fine grocery descriptions, notwithstanding the small supplies brought forward by importers This inactivity arises partly from rather heavy receipts, whils the high prices now reached induce the trade to operate with increased caution, although the stock, according to the latest retarns, was much less than for many years past at the corresponding date, and there are as yet no indications of diminished consumption. The market has been barely supplied with coffee, and buyers are waiting the supplies just arrived from Ceylon aud in course of landing. A mixed cargo of St. Domingo and Porto Rico has been sold for the Mediterranean at priceswhich have not transpired. A further aIvance has been paid for Guayaquil cocoa, which has now attained the remarkably high rate of 100f. per cwt. For rice only a moderate inquiry has prevailed at previous rates, although speculation in Liverpool appears to have revived. Beyond a further decline established for pimento, nothing of. interest has occurred in spice. The telegraphic message from China has not influenced the prices of tea, scarcely any transactions having taken plaee during the week. Saltpetre has been dull, and, excepting for fine descriptions, p rices show a slight decline wthere holders have made sae The olonial wool sales terminated to.day, and the following account of them is from Messrs. Southey and Son *- " The first series of sales of colonial wool of the seaon commenced- the 30th ult. and concluded this day, eom~- risng 15,320 bales of Sydney, 21,509 biles of Port Philllp, 8,.252 bales of Van Diemen's Land, 9,025 bales of South Australian, 398 bales of New Zealand, 35 bales of Swan River, and 7,604 bales of Cape; making a total of 62,143 bales, besides 1,016 bales of East Indian.

LAW BEPORT. COIURT OF C3ANCERY. ImcoLN's-mm. MAY 29. I -- - flT RE 'WOOfl,RnmN'% qT~wqr t-GvJ> wBLo1iD UHANWELLoR and tX LBRDS JUMCES of APPEAL.) IMs was an appeal from an order of the Master of the RoIIs making the trustee, who had paid tke trust fund into court under the Trustee Relief Act, pay the coats of the petition for obtaining the fund out of cout. The Master of the Rolls, upon considering the merits of the petition, thought that the trustee had paid in the trust fund without any sufficient reason, and therefore ordered him to pay the costs of the ce3tui que trusts petition to obtain their own money out of court. Upon the hearing of the appeal before the Lords Justices their Lordships were of opinion that the crder of the Master of the Rolls was a very just one, provided the Court had jurisdiction under the Act to make the trustee pay costs. As the question was one of considerable importance, their Lordships requested the Lord Chancellor to hear the appeal before the full Court of Appeal on tho point of jurisdiction. Mr. LLOYD and Mr. TOLLER, for the appellant, contended that the Court bad no power to givo costs personally against trst.ees, unless special authority for that purpose had beengive.n to it by Act of Parliament, which was not the cas i the present Act. I Mr. R. -cainier and Mfr. Shapter appeared to su~iport the order, but were not called upon. The LoRD CflANCELLoR delivered the judgment of the Court, and said that the trustee had availed himself of an Act of Parliament (10 and 11= Vitoria, chap. 96) to pay the trust fund inato Couirt, instead of filing a bil to have the trusts administered, and the sole point for cdete rmina. tion was whether the Court had jurisdiction to make him pay the costs of such a roceediMng. It was to be assumed that such an order woul ust and expedient, provided th;e Court had authority to make it. Now, after =isteing to a maost elaborate argument, he (the Lord Chancellor entirl3 c.i curmedwiththeodecision of the Masterof the Rolls. The second clause of the statute enacted " that such orders as shall seem meet shall be from time to time made by the Court of Chancery in respect of the trust moneys, &c., and for the investment and payment of any such moneys or of any dividends or interest upon any such stockr, &c., and or the administration of any such trusts eneraly, upon a petiton to be presented to the Lord chancellor or the Master of the 2iollswithoutbill; and every order made upon any such petition shall have the same authority and effect in the same manner as if the same had been mado in a suit regularly instituted in the Court." The question was, did this section give jurisdiction to the Court to make an order for the trustees to pay costs? It could hardly be seriously contended that the trustee would have escaped the payment of costs provided he had thought fit to file a biU to have the trust fund administered by tNis Court, and the point therefore was to see whether the Trustee Relief Act gave him any immunity for wrong. doing. It appeared to him (the Lord Chancellor) that the meaning of the Act was to enable trustees to pay into court irust funds without going through the formality of filing a bill, and that the Court was then to make such orders as might seem just. Looking at the words of the Act in their strict2st interpretation, the order of the Master of the Rolls appeared to him to be an order in respect of the truat funds paid into conrb, and was therefore quite right. If, however, the words had not been exactl what t were, he should have been very much disinclined to hold that the Court was prevented giving costs against a trustee who had misconducted himself. The argument of the a pellant, if correct, would go to the extent of preventing the Court awarding costs agamst any of the cestui que trusts whoimightimproperlyconductthemselves,-apropositionthe Courtcould not accede to. It was, however, said that there was along series of authorities the other way. His Lord. ship then reviewed them, and said that none of them seemed to apply to the present case with the exception, perhaps, of " Ex parte Hemmin" (3 K and J.). With respect to that decision of Vice-Chancellor Wood, he must observe that it did not appear to have taken up much time in discussion ; but if it were the deliberate opinion of that learned judge, he the Lord Chancellor) could only s, notwithstanding the difidence he felt in differing from him, his own opinion was directly the opposite. The appeal must be dismisEed, with costs. Lord Justice K?.'IORT BtUcx, in agreeing with the Lord Chancellor, said the case had been heard by the full Court of Appeal, not from any dif'iculty that the Lords Justices entertained respecting the question, but from the general bearing and importance of the case. Lord Justice TURNER concurred, and stated his opinion to be that the Act in question was never intended to relieve trustees from the risk of costs if they put the trust estate to unnecesary expense, except pro tanto of the difference between proceeding under the Act and the filing of a bill. Is BAx ustpTcy. Iy 'BE GREIG-EX PARTE THE OFFICIAL MAAGEPR OF TE ROYAL BRITISH} BANi. This was an appeal from an order of Mr. Commissioner Goulburn, holding that the call of 754 per shares made on the 10th of January last by Vice-Chaucellor linderaley was invalid, on the ground that the orders had not been signed by the Vice-Chancellor on the day they bore date, and consequently that they were merely the orders of his chief clerk, AMr. Pugh. The case had notproceeded far before the Court expressed a most decided opinion that the decision of the Commissioner could not be sustained in point of form. The order of the Vice-Chancellor, whether proper to have been made or not, could only be got rid of by a rehearing of the case before him, or by an appeal to this Court. It was ultimately arranged that the assignees of Greig should have the opportunity of questioning the proprnety of the caU upon its merits before this Court on Taesday next, provided they gave notice of their intention so to do in the course of to-morrow (Saturday). Mr. Bacon and Mr. W. D. Lewis appeared for the official manager; and Mr. Daniel, Mr. Speed, and Mr. Aspland (of the common law bar) for the assignees of Greig.
ROLLS' COIURT, CHcm!y-Lrw, r&Y 29. BARROW V. WADELM.-JDG3rXEN?r. (Before ae MASTM of theBRoL)j The MASTER of tho ROLLS gave judgment in this case, the facts of which are as follows :-In the year 1783 a per son named .1ohn Barrow, then about 16 years of ag, and a native of Lancaster, left England for America, where he arrived in the month of September in that year, and about five days after the treaty of peace between America and this country. In 1788 John Barrow became a naturalized citizen of the United States, and In 1806 married an American lady, by whom he had a large family. In January, 1843, a Mr. Thomas Barrow, of Elswick-lodge, Lancashire, and brother of John Barrow above mentioned, left the greater part of his zeal estates, by will, to his wife for life, and after her death to trnstees in trust for Elizabeth Barrow, the wife of his nephew John Barrow, of Skane. ateles, Onondagor County, New York, such 'Dephew being the son of the testator's brother John. In Jbne, 1843, the testator,ThomasBarrow, died, and in 1848 hiswife died. The qestion now raised was, to whom was the testator's property Wevised to Elizabeth Barrow (she being an alien) to pass, whether to the Crown or to the heir-at-law of the devisor or, in other words, vhether a trust for the benefit of an alien was void, or whether such trnst could be enforoed by or for the benefit of the Crown. His Honour, after zeviewing all the authorities at great lengtb, held that a eevise of real estate to an alien was not void so as to make Ihe land devised pass to the heir-at-law of the devisor, but that a devise to an alien was of such a nature that the Crown had power to enforce it. The form of declaration would therefore be, that Elizabeth Barrow being an alien, the Crown was entitled to the land devised to her. This decree in favour of the Crown is merely a formal one, and such as is seldom insisted on as against the intended devisee. Mr. R. Palmer, Mr. Follett, Mr. Wickens, Mr. Little, and Mr. Turner, among other counsel, appeared in the case.
VIC0E-CIANCELLOES' COUPTS. MJAY 29. IN RE TIlE BIMUNGHAM NATIONAL SCMOOL (Before Vice-Cancallor Sir R. T. KINDERsLEY.) lls was the petition of the trustees of the site of the Bimingham National School, which had been taken by the lond m and North-Western Railway Company for the parIo ies of their railway, and the object of the petition was to obtain the sanction of the Court to the application of a portion of the purchase-moneypaid by the company as a subscription towards the erection of a school, for which a site had been already purchased, and which was in the course of erection by aid of voluntary contributions. The schoolhouse which had been pulled down was erected by means of voluntary contributions, and in pursuance of certain resolutions passed in 1812, providing for the maintenance of the school in general conformity with the plan of the National Society or of the Lichfield Diocesan Society for the education of the poor, and that, in conformity with the views of the said societies, the children should be instructed in the Catechism and Liturgy of the Church of England, aud should regularly on the Sabbath day attend Divine service in some of the churcbes or chapels belonging to the establishment. The site on which the district schoolI was in the course of erection to which it was proposed to contribute a portion of the fund in court was purchased in 1854, and was by the purchase deed made subject to certain rules and regulations providing that the officiating minister of the ecolesiastical district in which the school was situate should have the superintendence of the religious and moral instruction of the scholars and, that the management in other respocta of the school should be vested in a committee, consisting of the officiating minister and of the churchwardens of members of the Church of England, and ten other persons, being members of the Church of England; and that, in case of difference between the minister and committee of management respecting the relgious instruction of the scholars, r the dismissal of any teacher on account of defective or unsound religious instruction, the decision of the bishop of the diocess should be conclusive; but the rules did notexpreesly provide for the instruction of the children in the Catechism and Liturgv, or for their attendance at church. Mr. Dx Gxx, in support of the petition, submitted to the Court, whether these requisitions were not substantialy secured by the regulations to which the new site was subjecot . Mr. BAiLY and Mr. M. A. SHEE, for the trustees of the new site, said that the regulations were such as most effectuaDy to sesure the objects which the subscribers to the ossgtnal school had in view. Mtr. WscEEscSn for the Attorney-General, submitted the question to the decision of the Court. Mr. Speedappearedfor therailway company. The YIcDCE-CacELI,os, said, upon the whole, be considered that the rules to which the new site was subject % ere such as would carry into effect the views of the original subscribers, and that on the petition being instituted under Sir Samuel Romilly's Act, as well as under the Lands Clauses Act, the order might be made. m RE THE CRYSTAL PALACE AMD WEST-END RAILWAY COMPAN'Y. This was the ordinary petition for payment of money out of court, representing the deposit for certain lands taken by the compeny, and the petition p rayed payment to the secre- ofrythe the company. A difficulty had arisen in consequence ofteregistrar, Mr. leach, considering that there ahonld be tbinaen order for payment to the company, who were peti- Mr, I, WxBB now said that he had obtaned nearly 100 similar orders to that now asked, some here and some at the . Rollswhich had been passed by Mr. ColviUlc, Mr. Bicknell, Mr. ood, Mr. Litham, and other registrars. The VICE-CHN03ron said that it was quite clear there ought to be either an authority under the seil of the coraTany, or some resolution (as Mfr. Glasse had auggesed) itat the money should be paid to the secretary. Mr. WEBB said the objection to that was the delay vwhish would be thereby caused. The VICE-CNCELLOR said, mnderstngthat so many similr orders had been made, he would make this order, but it must not estabhsh a precedent, and no other orders would be made until he had communicated with the other equity judges on the subject. 1Mr. WEIB said that he should feel muoh obliged to his Honour if he would Communicate the result of such consultation. L' RE SIR THOMAS MARION WI1iSN' ESTAT lMr. a. PERCEVAL appeared in supporSi of a petition in this matter, asking for the investment of certain sums of money, arising from copyholds which hadbeencompulsorily enfranchished under the Copyhold Enfranchisement Act, and the petition went on to ask that any future sums which might arise from the same source, without any further order being made, might be invested, and the dividends paid to the tenant for life. The Master of the Rolls in a similar case had made such an order. The VicE-CrANcmon doubted whether such an order, if made, could be satisfactorily worked in the AccountantGeneral's-office; but ultimately, although with considerable hesitation, made the order. HOWARD V. HAY. This was a petition by the executors of William Kay for the transfer- to them of certain sums of stock and Long Annuities under somewhat peculiar circumstances. It appeared that the testator had left his personal property to certain parties in the most general terms, and a considerable time after the testator's death the executors discovered the existence of the stock in question, but that such sums had been transferred by the Bank to the Commisioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, under the 59th of George IIt, chap. 60. The Bank refused to transfer unless three months' notice were given in two newspapers for claimants. This was ione in The Tiies and Morning Post, and a person named Villiam ay HBaunaford, from Devonshire, put in and persisted in clamuing one-third as next of kin of the testator, but, As the petitoners stated, had failed in substantiating it, and the Bank refusing to transfer to the petitioners, it was necessary to resent this petition, and the question was whether Mvr. W . K. Hannaford ought not to pay the costs? 3r. Hannaford had been served, but did not appear. A question was also raised as to the testator's identity as the owner of the stock. Mr. asch, Mr. Rawlinson, Mr. Dickenson, 3ir. Bovill, and Mr. Wickens appeared for the several parties. The VICE-CHACELLOR thought that there should be an affidavit of identity, and he had no doubt that if the Bank were informed that he (the Vice-Chancellor) wished to know when the transfer to the testator wrs made, they would furnish the information, as they always did to the Master, for the purposes of justice. The costs of the petition, so far as related to the claim of Mr. Hannaford, were so very trifing that he did not think he could make any order as to them. (Before ice-O7icellor Sir J. STuART.) IN RE THE SETLED ESTATES ACT AND PROCTER'S SETTLED ESTATES. This was the petition of the tenants for life and tenants in fee under the will of the late Ms. Procter, and also of the trustees of that will, praying that the trustees might be empowered to grant miningleases, under the 10th section of the Act passed in 1856 entitled "An Act to Facilitate Lcases and Sales of Settled Estates." The question was whether it was necessary that the leases should be settled in the ViceCbancellor's chambers, or whether the trustees might grant them without their being so settled. The petition was mentioned on a former day, and was directed to stand over, in order that the Vice-Chancellor might have an opportunity of conferrig with the Master of the Rolls and the other Vice-Chancellors on the subject. Mir. Malics and Mr. Brodrick appeared for the petitioners, The VICE-CHACELLOR now said that he had conferred wfth the Master of the Rolls and the other Vice-Chancellors on the subject, and he and they were all of opinion that the leases should be settled in chambers. That, however, did not necessarily involve their being settled by the conveyancing counsel of the Court, and the leases would only be submitted to them in the event of its being found necessary to do so. IN lE THE InPRISONED DEBTORS' DISCHARGE SOCIETY'S ACT (1856), AN1D TEE SOCIETY FOR THE DISCHARGE AND RELEF OF PERSONS fIPRISONED FOR SMALL DEBTS THROUGHOUT ENGLAND AND WALES. This was the petition of Mr. Benjamin Bond Cabbell, one of the trustees and governors and treasurer of the Society for the Discharge and Relief of Persons imprisoned for SmallDebts. Thesocietywas foundedin1772for thepurpose of procuring the discharge from prison of and relieving persons imprisoned in England and Wales for small debts. n consequence of the abolition of imprisonment on mesne process, and of other ameliorationsin the law, the applicants for assLstance from the society had so much decreased in number that the income of the society had for some time past exceeded the expenditure. The society therefore obtained an Act of Parliament in the session of 1856, empowering them, with the approval of this Court, to apply all or any part of their surplus income, in any one year. towards establishing or assisting any charitable institutions in England or Wales. The surplus income for the year 1856 amounted to 490& 8s. 3d.; and it was proposed, in pursuance of the powers of the Act, to appropriate thatsum among the followiDg charitable institutions in the proportions aftermentioned; that is to say :-To the Rent Ophthalmic Hospital, Mnaidstone. 100?; to St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington, 1001.; to the Middlesex Hoepital, 100h.; to the Benevolent or Strangers' Friend Society, No.7, Exeter-hall, 60. 8s. 3d. - to the Ragged School Union, No. 1, Exeter-hall, 80L; and to the North London Reformatory, 19, New-road, St. .ancras, S0. The object of the petition was to obtain the sanction of the Court to the above appropriation. Mr. Charles Hall appeared in support of the petition. The VICE-CHANCELLOR made an order, directing the payment of the sum of 490l. 8s. 3d. in the manner proposed. IN RE THE SETrLED EsrATES ACT AND FDDES' SETTLED ESTATES. This was a petition for the sale of certain lands settled by the wiiU of the late Thomas Fiddes. An order had been obtained at the Vice-Chancellor's chambers directing notice of the present application to be inserted in the London Gazette and othaer newspapers, pursuant to the Settled Estates Act of 1856. In the advertisements which had appearedintheLondonGazettethe testator was called "Tiddes" instead of " Fiddes," but he was properly designated in the advertisements which had appeared in the other newspapers. The consent of a married lady who had an interest in the property proposed to be sold for her separate use for life, wit a restriction onantidpation was necessary, and a question was raised as to whether a continent devisee of the property in question had, in the event which bad happened, any interest remaining in him so s to render it necessary or not to serve him with this petition M1r. Malins and Mr. Prendergast appeared in support of Thea ViCizO cELto held that the clerical error In the London Gazette, in calling the testator " Tiddes" instead of " Fiddes' prevented the Court from allowing the petition to be opened, and directed the petition to stand over, in order to insert a correct advertisement in the Gazette. His Honour, howvever, notwithstanding the defect in the adver- isement, took the consent of the married lady, but refused, until the advertisement was perfected, to entextain the question wvhether the contingent devisee should be served or not with the present petition. (Before Vice-Chancellor Sir W. P. WOOD.) 3MICKLBHWAIT V. 3ICKLETHWAIT. The VICE-CHANCELLOR gave judgment in this case, which was argued on Thursday, and said that the question raised as to the right of a tenant for life without impeachment of waste to cut down timber left for ornamental purposes, though it had frequently arisen, had never arisen under precisely the same circumstauces as in this case. The doctrine of the Court, to be gathered from the authorities, was that anything either planted or left for ornament was beyond the power of a tenant for life. In this case there were two properties, Beeeton and Taverham-hall, lying within eight miles of each other, with a mansion upon each. The property was held by the testator as tenant for u under his own settlement, made in 1812, but he might be treated for all purposes as the owner in fee. In 1823 he ceased to reside at Beeston, which was left unoccupied. In 1845 the Beeston house, which was then very much dilapidated, was pulled down by the testator, who removed to Taverham-hall. The gardens and shrubberies were allowed to fall into a wild sahte, and belts of trees were planted with a view to the preservation of game. The tstator proceeded to cut down several handsome trees dotted about the park, but he did not appear to have done more with theavenue than to plant underwood, leaving the main body of itstandio,. The will was made in 1852, and the testator died in 1856. In the will was contalned a power to lease for 14 years, but no power to let for building purposes. The question than was whether the house having been taken down, and acts of ownership exercised as to certain trees, the Court could arrive at the conclusion that the testator in his settement of this estate had intended th-t it should be considered a deprived of it^ ornamental character, and treated as mere ordinary property available for farming purposes. No case had gone entirely the length of this case, wlhere the residence had been abandoned, where there was a power of letting for 14 years and no power of granting building leases. He could not, however, say that these circumstances raised such a substantial distinction as to induce him to hold that the tenant for life as to these trees, which were originally ornamental, could now change their character, In" Wombwell v. Belasyse," decided in 1825, and reported in a note to 6 Vesey p 110, Lord Eldon stated it as established doc. trine "That the auestion is not whether the timber is or is not ornamental, Cut the fact to be determined is that it was planted for ornament, or, if not originally planted for ornament, was left standing for ornament by some person having the absolute power of disposition." It was contended that taking down the house in respect of which the ornament afforded by these trees was made was in itself conclusive of an abandonment of the ornamental character, and the cutting down some of the trees and the sing power were also relied upon. Tbese, however, were far too trifing indications of intention to distingiU the case from the current of authorities. Ee admitted that " ornament" implied human spectators, wbo must also be owners, but it would be a very narrow construction to say that the owner must have his residenoe upon the spot, or else that no amount of ornamental planting could be protected. The owner of a property upon which he was not resident, as in the case of Bolton-bber, might plait his esate for ornamental purposes, for the enjoyment of himself and his sue censors. H could not consider that there was anytng amounting to an evidence of intention on the part of the testator to alter the character of tho edate, snd the injunction munt be oontinued, with certain inquiries which were directed.

The defendant Hayes was employed in coating the Philosopher for the owners, Messrs. &arrison, with asphalt, and denied that he was infringing the patent of the slaintidM, alleging that he did not apply any coating of varnish before applying the asphalt, and st&ting other differences. Upon the hearing of the present motion ho raised a question as to the validity of the patent invention claimed by the plainti Two scientifi menk had proceeded to Liverpool, byv direction of the Court,, and insp-ected the coating of the PhUlosopher, and theY distinctly stated that the composition had en aplied in two distincet layers.

LORD XSDUEDlTON. The arguments in this cuae were resumed. The following is a short outline of theo more mnaterial facts of th3 ease:-Upon the death of Godfrey, Lord tacdonald, the plaintiffs grndfather, in 1832, the title of "Lord Macdonald' was wasumed by his seond son, who entered into possession of the lands and barony of Macdonald and his Straithiwordeil estates, in the Isle of Skye, while certaia estates known as the Yorkshire estates vwere taken by the plaintiff's father, Alexander WilliAm, Robert eBoville, the tirstbor son of Godfrey, Lord Macdonald, under the provisions of the will of Wrksam Bose e, uncle of Lord Macdonald. About the year 1843 doubts were suggested a to the doniiU of Lord xacdonald at the time of hiu iarriaUge in 1803, raising the quastion as to whether the plaintiff's father, bn in 1800, was or not legitimate and entitled to the Seotch estates. Considerable litigation ensued upon thisquestion. In 186 an arrangement was tmade between A. W.R .Bosvthe and his brother Godfrey Wi0l.im Went. worth, Lord Mcdonald, that Mr. Bosville and his son, the present tiff, who attained his majority in January, 1847, shouldl renouce all rigt and interest in the Scotch estates, retaining the Yorkrhire estates, while Lord MeYdonald retained the Scotch and renoanced the Yorkshire estates. In 1847 a Bill was brought into Parliament for the purpose of releasing the Scotch estates from all claim of A. W. R. Bosviff and the paintiff or their respective heirs, and to releoae the Yorkh r estates from all claim of Lord Macdonald and his heirs While the Bill was before Parliament the Committee of the House of Lords at the instine of the late Lord Shaftesbury, required that soine compensation should be provided to thoe unbrn ibse of the plaintiff, for their deprivation of the possibility of suceeding to the lands and barony of Macdonald.The defendantWilliiams, who was Mr. Boevilldes solicitor, recommended that in order to meet the requiition of the committee, the Yorkshire estates, of which the entail had recently been badred by the plaintiff and his father, should be settled i strict settlement, and that a provision should be made for enabling Mr. Bosville to raise 25,0001. by charge upon the estates. A clause providling for the settlement of the Yorkshire estates was introduced into the Bill which recited the consent of the plaintiff to the settlement. The BiW passed, end reeived the Royal asnt in July, 1847. Mr. Bosvilue died In September, 1847, before any settlement of the Yorkshire estutes had been exeruted, or any money raisedl upon them by sale or mortgage. Mr. Bomvillo was largely indebted at the time of flii' death. An application was made to Parliament to eniable the plaintiff to raise 25,0001. by sale or mortgage for the purpose of paying the debts of the plaintiff and his father, but the Bill did not pas Mr. Williams, who had recommended the plaintiff to apply to Parliament, advised him that the only method of discharging these debts was by raising noney on security of the life estate and remainder to he limited to him by the settlement directed by the Act of 1847, and that he was bound to execute such settlement. This settlement, which was dated the 19th of October, 1846, was executed by the plaintiff; the effect of which was, after raising ajointire of 8001. per annum for the plaintiff's mother, to limit the estates to hin for isfe, with remaitder to his imue in tail, and the ultimate remainder to himself in fee;. 25,0001.'was subsequently raised by mortgage and apped n n payment of the debts of the plaintiff and is father. In 18 54wthoeplaintiff, who ha previously employed Mr. WMiims as his legal adviser, consulted another solicitor, and was then, as he alleged, for the first time made acquainted with the trae purport and effect of the deeds, and of the provisions, and of the misrepresentations made to him upon the subject. He had thereupon filed his bill, praying that he might he relieved from the consequences of his consent to the provson in the Act for the settlement of the Yorkshire estateh, on the gound that it was obtained fRom himi improperly, and that th settlement of the 19th of October, 1848, might be set aside. The case made by the bill was that the provisions introduced into the Act were of an unreasonable character and consented to by the plaintifctwho thereby gave up a great advantage without consideration, without dnue explanation being made of their effect; that he was not assisted or protected by anysindependent professional adviser, nor was he afforded an opportunity of judging of their fAirness; that their effect (without imputing any frbaud) was m isreresented to him; fand that he was at the tme whoy dhepsendenthe eponjhis her oand under his inheuence,vand othat itwasundeurthis cspeciesof pressure that henehad beeninducbtaed to cn tosle, oharrangement, which botavesolrge auch benert tnoyn t ther withousthe slightest advn,tagerevas thiself disnct retdn the rights which he te Attorney-Geeral andi Mr. Clement Swan ston were for the plaintiff. atr. olt, Mr. Daniel, M r. nMr. Nalder, M.Bates, Mr. B hawe, jun., ad r Clarles Parke, for the several defendats, were not called upon. The VICE-Chno aELLop said that he had had the advantage of the very comprehensive o ning of the AttorneyGeneral, and also of the extreml able argument of Mir. Swanston, which touch everypoint of difficulty in othecase. Threplaintiff, however, had failed in the very foundation of his whole case. With respect to the 25,0004, he was not at present satisfied that auty sufficient explanation had been given to the plaintiff when he consented to the provisions in the Ac, but u n the other points the cae was different. bis honour, e ersadvsrti f to the facts of the case, s d, tha itWas theo perfectly common interest of father and son to secure to themselves the enjoyment of the Yorkshire estates. The litigation sought to be put an end to was not the grievance of the fatheronly. So far from any special benefit being obtained by Mr. Bosville, or purchased for him by the plaintiin it was a common benefit, as they both very much preferred enjoying the Yorkshire estates to flling the position of Scotch iairds. Then, as to explanation, there was the distinct evidence of Mr. Williams, fortified by his entries and bill of costs, of his explaining to the plaintiff the nature of the measur and conferring upon the objections raised. It was said that a large benefit accrued to the father fromn getting the Bill passed, and that he ought not to have procured his son's consent. If the father had been the only person benefitted by the Bil, then the case would be withi the ordinary rules of this court as to parental influence. There was just as much desire, howevear, onx the part of the son as of the father to live in Yorkshire-a substantial benefit secured to him by the Act, which he was even now desirous to retain, and there was nothing to induce the Court to say that the father had obtained any undue benefit or exercised any uadue influence. As to the 25,0001., the clause relating to it ought not to have been introduced by Mr. Wiliamas without much more consjideration. Whether the plaintiff could now berelieved by the Legislature from theeffect of the Actit was not for this Cour to say. He waLs still unmarried, and there bein no person whose interests were likely to be ijrd n the Scotch law as to entails (which hdidcdtecm mittee to raise the objection) havn bealrd,the I,egislature might think it reasonaltoforthpaiif relief. There was no course atpen,hovr,bt to dismuiss the bill.
COURT OF QUEENS BENCH, WBTnsMR. MAY 29 THE QUEEN V. THE PROVOST AMND COLLEGE OF ETO ', _-- MAD ANOTHER. imutus tn Jianco, before Lord CAePBzLL and Justies COLERIDGE, ERLE. and CRompmOveA 'lhiwas an action of quare impedit, brought by the Attorney-General against the Provost and College of Eton and the Rev. John Alexander Olarke (clerk), in order totry the right of the Crown to present to benefices avoided by the appointment of the incumbents thereof to colonial bishopncs. The declaration was as follows _"Be itremembered that the provost of the College Royal of the Blessed Mary, of Eton, near unto Windsor, in the county of Bucks, and the same college, and also the Rev. John Alexander Clarke (clerk), were sunmoned to answer our Sovereign Lad the Queen of a plea that they permit our said Lady the Queen to present a fit person to the church of Stratfield-Mortimer,. in the county of Berks, which is void and is in the gift o! our said lady the Queen. And therefore our Sovereign Lady the Queen, by Sir Richard Bethell, Knight, Attorney. General of our said Lady the Queen, who for our sid Lady the Queen prosecutes in this behalf, says that heretofore, to wit, on the 10th day of -Septernber, in the year of our Lord 1840, the said erovost and College, being seised in fee of the advowson of the said churh of Stratfield-Mortimer, did present thereto the Rev. Henry John Chitty Harper, their clerk, who, on such presentation, was duly admitted, instituted, and inducted into the same; and the sid church afterward4, to wit, on the 10th day of August, in the year of our Lord 1856, became vacant by the appointment by our said lady the Queen of the said H. J. C. Harper to be bishop of the bishopric of Christ Church, in the colony of New Zealand, the same being within and part of the domninous of our sad Lady the Queen, and by the consecration of theamd H.a.

To this declaration the Provoat and College of Eton pleaded a lony plea, which in substance stated that they were seised in ee of the advowson of the living in itUon, uiders.a chartor and letters patent f King Henr a,eon drimed by Patliament; and tbat, OnL the av-Oidanceof the benefice, by the consecration of the fqxwr in. cuinbent, ]3; J.

Clarke) to the said church, who, upon such presentation, was dul adimited instituttd, a.nd induoted as perpeel vicar and incumbent. The defendant (the Rev. J. A. Clarke) pleaded a phi^, in which he alleged that he wa vioar and ineumbent of the said church, and that tho Queen ought not to xue him, because be sid that true it was that on the 10th of Feptember, 1846, the Provost and College of Eton presented the sad HT. C. Harper to the aid living, and that the aie became vaeant on the 10th of Auagust, 185, by the said consecration of the mid HL J. C. Harper as mch bishop, nevertheless, the defendant said *t that the mid bishcpm of ChrIst Church was and is a si bishopric aeyee . ad constituted, and situate whoGlly an parts beyond the seas, and not withimn anJ 1re of the united kingdom of Great B' t an d 'reand, and that after tho living became vacant-yit, on the 10th of Auigu,st -the Provost and College ofEtonp resented him(thie lefendant) to the said church, upon which he wai dsdly admitted, instituted, and inducted.to To these piess the Crown demurred, and thus raiEed two questions for the eonsideration of the Court :-I. Whether, on the avoidanaof a livng by the consecration of the incumbent ai a ccloni bishop, the Crown had the power to presert to the living so vacated; and O whether in this particular case, the claim was not inconsistent with the originl grant of the advowpuo to the college. The ATToR t *Gz.,G=ER4 L (with whom were Mr. Welaby and Mr. A. 31. Stevens) said the question to be decided -by the Court in this case wai, whether, upon the promotioi of a beneficed clergyman to a colonial bishopric, whereby the benefice became void, the right of presenting tothe living vested in the Crown, or whether there was a distiuctionkto. be drawn, ini regard to the Royal prerogative, between that catse and where the clerk 'was promoted to a bishiopric in England or in Ireland. The question arose in a qwre impedit, on as demurrer to the defendante' pleas. The first question aro8 e on the declaratiot-yin, whether the ordinary prerogative of the Crown arose on the promotion of a clerk to at colorial bishopric; and a second questiozt arose on the plea-viz., whether the Crown was impeded in claiming the preroaptive, as being in derogation of ite own. grant. Lordl CAasrnann Said, the learned Attorney-Genan mnust Ehow that a colonial bishop came within the same category as an English bishop. It 'was diffiult to know what a colo. nial bishop was - he had not the ordinary status of abilslop of the English dhurch. The ATToY.V-GENi-ERo said, the Queen, as head of hev Church, stood in the sme relation to colonial bTshops asibe did towards the ordinary bisops of the establishedchurch, and the prerogative of the Crown attached in like manner. The general notion wa that this was a right claimea by the Pope, as Bishop of Rome, and trasferred to the ,rown dy the statute of the 25th of Henry VIU.U, which declared ihe Klng to bephead of the Church. That, however, was nob a correct view of the case, for it appeared from .rook's .A rgmernt (fol. 151, s. 51), that the Crown had exercised, tbisrightlongbefore the Reformation. In cptheo is:hdc of Ely's case," on the bi'sro by King Edw 3. .the King presented totth benefice pro i of r ace, thouglo it 'was in the patronage of another pro prtrogativsi a because the living was void from the Miug's having made the incumbent abishop. So alo in "Doctor and Student" 2, Did., 0. 36), it was said, that it shou!ld, be judged by tOe Kinges Law whether a benefice is void or whether it is not, and not by the law of the church; as where a person ismuad bish6p, or has acoepted another benefice withont license, or ia deprived, or has resigned, an these casea the cotmon law saya the benefsce is void, and so they should be though a law 'were made by the church to the cotntry. That case showedthat it was considered as part of the prorogative of the Crown, enuring by the common law. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE said he thought the ca did not; touch the poinat. The ATroTon -GHNERL said, he cited it to show that by the common law the benefice became void. He thexn citedl Wright's case (Moore, 399). Mr. Justioe COLresnt, Said there was no mention of ' bishopric in that case. The ATrORNEYiG&dscL said it was implied, from the use of the word " cesson," that the clerk was promoted.to a bishopric; and it was held that the Crown was entitled to, present. It was said the Kng should have the presentationl when the livine became void by "cession." Mr. Justice UOL.nMGE.-That assumes that there can bo no "1cession" unless where the clerk is made a bishop. The ATTOnsxy-Gxi,AL then cited the note in Dyer,' 228 d., and the observation of Gros, ZT., in "1Troward v. Caillard and Another" (6 T. IL, 442). Lord CAsPBnLm siddthat, s to the prerogative of the Crown in these cases, there could be no doubt whatever; but still they'were important to be referred as showing the history of the prerogative. Mr. JustileeoCo GE aid it would be very mnaterial if the leared Attorney-General could cite any case which showed the princ,pleo on which the prerogative of the Crown wasfounde. HisL ord hip-suggesd that it ightbesd that the Crownhe founder of all bishopric and that they were endowel by Lord CAnur'nrL.nsaitd lh-leI thought that, in ascrtaining ywhether theoprerogativeof the Crown extendedatothis claim, it'was important to ascertain the principle on wohich th prerogative of the Crown rested. The ATToR Ty-GENEAL said the extent of the Royal prerogative was shown by the cases which had bgen decided,. and then proceededl to show what the status of a colonia bishop was. Tr. Jutce COLERIDGE said that the Archbishop of Sydlney was now made a quasi patriarch. The ATEommy-GER'EnAz, in answer to a question from Lord CampbelsaiWd the Judicial Committee of the Privy CouncRIl hd been consulted by Her Majesty as to whether a statute sent over to this country from Ca"a.4 came mitbin tho powers of the 36th of George JIII, and thea committee 'had decided that it did; but that decisionL did not affect this question, as it tuLrned upon the construction of an Act of Parliament. The learned Attomney-Genera having cited WoodIey's case Cro. Jse, and a case in -Palmer, 457,, and the 34th of Henry VIIL, chap. 7, referred to Dr.. Hampdea's case, in which Mgr. Justice Coleridge had said that t-he colonia bishops we re created by the Royal prero-. gative aloneu and, he observed that in all the statutes the colomial BsAops were spoken of as emanating from the Crown and not from any Act of Parliament.

Mr. Joseph Brown was forthe plaintiffs; Mr. Brett for the defendants. This was a special case, which set out a long correspondence, from which it appeared that the defendants were merchants in Liverpool, consigning goods for sale to a house of Osborne, Syme, and Co., in Amenea, and that Hammond, the bank. rupt, was a merchant in London, whose name had been given to the defendar,ts by Osborne, Syme, and Co., and who, on theshipmentof the cargoes, hadnaccepte3dthe draughts of the defendants drawn on him to the amount of twvo-thirds of the value of the cargoes fovardedwto America. The American house and Hammond had hoth become bankrupt The contention on behalf of the plaintiffs was that Hammond acceptedthe draughts for the defendants, and that they were liable to pay him on failure of the American house; it was contended on behalf of the defendants that Hammond was merely the agent of Osborne. Syme, and Co, and had undertaken to look only to them for repymnent of his advances. The COURT took time to consider its judgment. CHESTERTON (APPELLANT) V. BRAMLEY (RESPONIDKNT). This was an appeal from the decision of the County Court Judge of Leicester. Mr. Phipson appeared for the appeUant, and Mr. Mundell for the respondent. The question raised for the decision of the Court arose on an action by the respondent against the appellant for not giving up posEession1 of a house and premises which' he nd received notice to quit. T'he respondent let the premises at an improved rent to another tenant named Harcourt, who, on not being let into possession by the appellant, brought his action against the respondent, who settled the action by paying him damages and costs amounting to 371., and this sum the respondent sought to rncover as damages from the appellant for not giving up possession of the premises. The County Court judge found that the settlement and sum paid by the plaintiff to Harcourt *vere reasonable, and decided in favour of the plaintiff, and from that decision the defendant appealed. For the appellant It was contended that the damages sought to be recovered was too remote, and that the real damage sustained was being prevented from obtaining the increased rent, and that this only could be recovered. For the respondent it was contended that the action was in the nature of an action of trespams for increased profits, and that these damages were consequent on the defendant's rofusing to give up possession, aud could be recovered. The CouRT thought the decision of the County Court judge right, although they would not so far extend the principle a s to hold that the plaintiff ight have recovered any special damage incurred fromhavnug let the propertyfor some extraordinary purpose. .Judgment for the respondent. (Sitings at Hisi Prusi, at Guildhlla, before Mr. Justice (RonxVDER and a Common Jury.) This was the first sittings in Trinity Term for the city of London. All the causes entered for trial were disposed of in the course of half an hour with the exception of CAVALIERO V. AFLATO. Mr. HUDDLESTON, who appeared for the plaintiff, in his address to the jury, said that the only formidable portion of this case was the names of the parties o l the record, and that they would, in the end, fnd that there was no greater difficulty in disposing of it thanthere hadbeen in trying the preceding causes. It appears that Mr. Cavaliero, who, notwitbstanding the foreiga termination of bhs Dame, was an Englishman, had contracted with Mr. Aflato to make a quantity of sacks for the reception of Indian corn, ia which commodity he was a dealer, at Is. each. These sacks were to be made of gunny, a material of which wrappers containing Eastern goods were generally constructed, and which was used in this country for bags. These sacks having been made wei 3 duly delivered, and being double the usual size were capable of containing four bushels of corn. Some had been returned, and, allowing for these and for a sum of 151. odd paid by the defendant, being after the rate of 4u. asack, the sum claimed was 261. &. 2d. Mr. MACAULEY, Q.C., appeared for the defendant, and said, that Mr. Aflato contended that no such agraement .s that spoken of by the plaintiff, so far as price was concerned, had been entered into that " gunny" was to be parchased at suc h a price as would enable Mr. Cavaliero to sell his sacks at 4d. a piece, and tha,t Mr. Aflato had paid quite su=ffcient. Ee then called the defendant, but he did not appear. Mr. Justice CROWDEB then said, that even admitting that Mr. Aflato had not understood his bargain rightly, the jury would never believe that Mr. Cavallero would sell his sacks for 4d. when it was clear that he had got 5d. for sacks half the size from the defendant himself, and when it was equally clear that at such a price he must lose. The judry returned a verdict for the plaintiff for 261. 3s.2d Ir. HUDDLESTON, in applying for immediate execution, stated that a judgment had been obtained in this same cause and execution had been issued, but that Mr. A&flato had endeavoured to starve the man in possession, and, had made an affidavit of merits, and so succeeded in reopening the question. Mr. MAcAuLEY protested strongly against the observations of Mr. Huddleston, but admitted that an order for execution in four days would meet the exigency of the case. The Court then rose, this being the last cause in the MiSt. I.NG V. SLBERBDERG. In this case, a report of which was given in 27e T-ims of to-day (Friday), the jury found a verdict for the defendant.
COURT OF EXCHEOUER. TRhmxv MAV 9S EX PABTE BAKER (SiUjin- in Banco.) Mr. ZSCOTLAWD moved for a writ of habeas Corpus on behalf of a youth who had been convicted of absenting himself from the service of his master, under the statute 4th of George IV., chap. 34. The learned gentleman stated that the application had been refused by the Court of Queen's Bench [a report of the case appeared in The Times of yesterday (Thursday)]; but the question was one of importance. The point was raised on the folowiug state of facts:-The boy had absented himself from his master's service, and of that offence he had been convioted and sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. At the expiration of that term, the boy, deeming that his service was put an end to, engaged himself to another master, with whom he worked till he was again summoned by his former master for absenting himEelf again from his service, and it was against the conviction which followed such second summons that this application was directed. The COURT granted the writ in the first instance, and it was understood that it was made returnable on hfonday next. Rule granted accordingly. NEW TRIAL PAPER.-VAUGHAN V. DOWNES. This was a rtule for a new trial on the ground of misdirection and excessive damages. The plaintiff was the tenant of a farm belonging to a gentleman in Shropshire, ,whcse agent was the defendant, and this was an action for an excessive distress and for breaking and entering the farm and ploughing up the land. To these causes of action the defendant paid 171. into court. At the trial before Mr. Justice Willes evidence of oppressive acts prior to the distress was given to show that the defendant was actuated by improper motives, and his Lordashi in summing up told the jurv-that they might take those act8 into consideration in estfmating the damages for the excessive distress if they thought it proceeded from iUfselimg and was not a mere mistake. Tho jury having found for the plaintiff wiih 1831. damages beyond the sum paid into court, and this rule having been obtained, Mr. Whately and Mr. Cooke now showed cause. Mr. Scotland and Mr. Phipson wero heard in support of the rule. Before the last learned gentleman had concluded his address, Mr. Baron BRAIWELL stated that he had had the opportunity of conferring with Mr. Justice Willes, who had expressed it to be his opinion that though the defendant had acted harshly towards the plaintiff, the damages were yet excessive. Under these circumstances the question was whether the parties could not settle the damages between them. The CnizF BAEox ultimately suggested that the damages ought to be reduced to 1101. Mir. WnATELY took time to confer with his client, whom he would urge to accept the proposed terms. Judg-ent deferred accordingly. (SlUtngs at Nisi PMius at Guildhai, before Mr. Baro,s CIIANNELL and Common Jukes.) The Court was occupied this morning in trying several causes which were not of the slightest public interest. His Lordship having to go to chambers the Court ad. journed at half-past 2 o'clock.
I EC1HEQUER CHAMIBER. FRIDAV. MAy 9fi (4iiUlings in Elrror.-Prueni4 the CRPiEF B --Io- and Barons MARTIT and WATSOX, and Ar. Justice WIES.) The jutdges met this morning by arrangement to give judgment in the case of Z ESPOSITO V. BOWDEN. This was an action upon a charterparty, by which a British merchant chartered a vessel, before the Russian war broke out, to proceed to Odessa, and there load a cargo, and then to proceed to a port in this kingdom, and the question was, whether the subsequent breaking out of war before the vessel arrived at Odessa operated as a dissolution of the charterparty, it being alleged that it was impossible to complete the loading witnout dealing with the Queen's enemies. It had been established that a declaration of war involved an interdiction of commercial intercourse. The mQatter had been argued before the Court of Queen's Bench two years since, -ben that Court decided in favour of the plaintiff. .pon that decision there was a writ of error, and the case was argued some time since, but time was taken for consideration. Mr. Justice WiLLES now read the judgment of the Court at very great length, but it is only necessary to state the result, as the greater part of the judgment consisted of quoting cases wbich had been long since determined. This Conrb was now of opinion that for a British subject to ship a cargo from an enemy's port was primtfacie a dealing and trading with the enemy, and therefore forbidden bylaw, it rested upon theperson alleging it to bo a legal acS to establish that propostion. The Sovereign had a right to proclaim war, with all its consequencee. It was a contract which oould not be completed without a dealing and trading with the enemy. The Court, tberefore, was of opinion tbat the judgment of the Queen's Bench ought to be reversed, and tha the judgment should be for the defendants.

POLICE. MAYSION-HOUSE.-Gustave Hahn, Arnold De Gruyter, and HermanBahmer were bronght before the LoRD AYOR, charged with having stolen 18 pieces of American cloth and 36 calfskin, the property of Mr. Lonis Morice Bacharach, a merchant, carrying on business at 28, Clement's-lane, The prisoners were also chargedwith having uttered a forged order for the delivery of the goods. The prosecutor having been sworn said,-The prisoner Bahmer was in my employment as clerk. On the 2d inst. I left my counting-house about 5 o'clock, it being his duty to lock up the place and to deliver the key to the housekeeper. The order produced marked "A" is not in my writirg, and it was not written with my authority. Bahmer had no authority to remove any of my goods. The order marked "B" is not in my handwriting. Last night Bahmer was brought to my house, when he said, " I am very sorr for what I have dono. I know I have done wrong, but was led away by 60 ne f'iends at the time. I ran away, leaving the boy in the office, bat returned and took the three dozen calfskins, which I pawned." I have seen the prisoner De Gruyter once or twice as a friend of Bahmer's. James Russell, assistant to Mr. Jacob Russell, pawnbroker, of No. 10, Shoreditch, said,-I produce a piece of American cloth. I received nine pieces of the same sort on the 2d inst. in pledge from the prisoner Hahn. The duplicate produced by the officer corresponds-with what I produce. T. Reeves.-I, am house-porter at 28, ClemenVs-lane. On Saturday, the 2d inst., Balhrer came to the office after the prosecutor had left, aid asked me for the key of the office. He told me that a man was coming to the office to take away certain goods. About 7 o'clock the same evening a boy came with a truck and gave me the paper produced, and I handed it to Bahmer, who pointed out to the boy the goods he was to take. The property spoken to by the prosecutor was then taken away in the truck. On the 4th nst. twomen (wrho wrereafterwards given into custody and discharged) came with a truck and presented tome the docnment marked "B," and asked for the remainder of the goods, bht I did not deUver them. George MIoore, a labourer, said,-On Sunday evening, the 3d inst., Hahn and De Gruyter came to nmy house together, when the former said that the latter wanted to remove from his place of business, and asked to assist him. The next morning Hahn came to my house and gave me the following order *- zMr.tReeves, 25, Clement's-ssae, Lomb2rd-street. "Please tO gve the b are the catlfkku and lesat'er cloth. "Oom Ld Mor ce Bachar&ch and 0a. London, May 4, les." I accordingly went to the prosecutor's premises with another man, when we were taken into custody, but were afterwards discharged. Mr. J. W. Fryeet, a pawnbroker in the Whitechapelroad, said,-I produce three dozen calfskins, which were pledged at my shop on the 2d inst. for 51. I also took in on the same day five pieces of American cloth, which were pledged by Hahn. Louis Moore, a lad 14 years of age, said he had been em. ployed by Hahn to fetch the prosecutor's property from the premises in Clement's-lane, in a truck. He proved having delivered the property to the prisoners. The prosecutor was rezalled and identified as his property the cloth and skins produced bv Mr. Fryett. W. Smith, policeman No. 572, said,-I went with my Inspector and the prisoner Bahmer to a common lodginghouse in Mint-streat, Borough, and there found the prisoners Hahn and De Gruyter. I charged them with being concerned in stealing cloth and leather of the value of 30L., belonging to MIr. Bacharach. De Gruyter said he did not know anything about it. On the road to the Mansion-house Hahn said to me, " What do you think I shaU get? Do you think I shall get six months? I did not know the things were stolen till after I got them." Babmer said they were all three going to Liverpool that morning at 7 o'clock, and that he was led into the commission of the act by the other prisoners. The prisoners, who said they should reserve their defence, were fully committed for trial. As soon as the prisoners were removed Philip Worff was placed in the dock, charged with having corruptly taken money of MIr. Bacharach on the pretence of assisting to recover the property of which he had been robbed. Mr. Bacharach said,-Abont 10 or 12 days after the robbery the prisoner came to me and said, " I have heard you would give some money for getting your tickets," or " your goods," I forget which. He added, " Perhaps I know the person who has bought the tickets; what will you give me if I get them for you VI I asked him how much he wanted, and he said 31. I told him I would give him 21. on receiving the tickets, and 11. on receiving the goods back. I then gave him a paper, of which the following is a cony: to the deiirereroftisketsfor18pice-sof American lather cloth besides thuee doses calfskins, I will give on delivery £2, and wheni receive the articles b,ck£1 tmore. Y o London, way 14, 5S57. I m s BACHAnACH" Four or five days afterwards the prisoner called on me and asked how it was with the money, upon which I said to him, " How is it with my tickets " He replied, "I shall get them for yon. W-ill you go with me'" He then told me that he must pay 8Os. extra for the tickets, as the nian who had them had bonght them for that sum. I went with himntoapublichouse in theneighbourhood of Fenchurchstreet, when he left me and said ho would be hack in a few minutes, He returned with another man, and asked me for the 21. Isaid to him, "Who has the tickets5$" Heraeplied, pointing to his companion, "' This man has." I took the four tickets into my hand, upon which he again asked for the 21. After some further conversation I gave them 1L. each. The prisoner was remanded. GUILDHALL.-James Howse, a rag-merchant of Pleetlane, appeared on a summons to answer a charge of assault, under the fo'lowiug ciroumstances:- Ms Corbey said, she lived next door to the defendant, and on the day mentiored in the summons she heard screams of " Murder !" issuing from the defendant's shop, and upon going in to ascertain the cause she fonnd the defendant holding his wife by the hair of the head upon the ground. Complainant expostulated with tho defendant, and said he would kill his wife, and she then stooped towards him to make him relax his hold, when the defendant struck her violently on the shoulder with some instrument, which had quite disabled her, and he also struck her a blow upon the eye, which was quite closed in consequence for some days, The compisnant was corroborated, and evidence was then called for the defence, which, however, did not tend to rebut the chae Aldermsu~an Es said the deFendant had been gnuilty of a vey gross assault upon this woman, and it was evident he haa also very much il-used his wife, and he therefore fined him 5Th, or in default two months' imprisonment. The finc was paid. MARLBOROUGH-STRET.-John Burchell, a well-known thief and aasociato of a gang of- desperate characters, waS brought up for final examination, charged with having asSiste in a snurderous asault ont Po,ace-constable Joy, A 338. - Tho constable, who is well knowvn for his. activity in ip. prehending street pickpockets, saw the prisoner and a companion at"tempting to pick the pockcets of several ladies and gentlemen in Regent-street and Osford-street. ~The prisoner having becomneaware that they were watched -sad. denlyr diiappeared. The oonstable was in Greek-streeti about ?o)cmck eao same evening, hen he saw the prisoner, and ,hld4 bim four or five members of tl desperate gang of thieves with whice he was sociated. The prisoae or eredng bhi intstaty mne usp to him, and, making an tnslent remark, struck him a, violent blow on the face. The constable seized him, ut the prisoner's compnon camne round them and bet gan a general attack upon him. The constable was repea bely knocked down and kicked about the body until he was one mam of bruites, and every feature was beaten out of al human proportion. Fortunately an alarm was given, and assistanoe arrived in time to .reventf frthereviolence,and posiblytosavthe constable's hY(e, camea all hu ot incenTible when several other consta,bles interfered. The prisoner -as taken, and in addition to the asosault evidence was given of the prisoner being a determined thief . Mr. BRqGHA decided on sending the eae for trial, and ordered the depositions to t e taken. The prisoner was removed into the clerk's office for that purpose, and at that moment Mx. Lewis, jun., of EIY-Place, who it appeared had been engaged by the prisoner to defend him, entered the court, an askeed the magistrate not to se-nd the prisoner far tril' but to deal with the case sumW 3narily. Mr. ]3noHA said the case was far beyond his powers It was of such a nature that a eury ought to decide upon the punishinent. Mr. Lewis, in so low a 'tone as to be inaudible, made a further appeal or. behalf of his client, which was successfuL The pisoner was then brought into court, and Mr. B GT.Am sentenced him to three months' imprison inent for antemptinzm to pick poerkets, and one month additional for the assaut on the constable. The depzty-gaoler Bendall took the prisoner out of court, but brought him back immediately, and stated that the pristoner, in retuu for the lenity with which he had been treated, had threatened the constable with vengeance when he came out of prison.

On Thursday afternoon Mr. Bedford, eoroner for West. minster, and a highly-respectable jury, were occupied several hours at Millbank Penitentiary in investigating the cause of the death of Edward Gray, aged 34 Years. formerly a commercia traveller, and more recently a teacher of mathematics, but at the time of his death a coneict in that establishment5 whiodied- in the infirmary under circum. stances of amnost extraordinar nature. Captain Vivian Craig, depultygovernor of the prison, deposed that the deceased was tried for obtaining noney under fal pretenee at Bedford. en November 9, 1852, and sentenced to teven yearas trasportation. His health wVa stated to be good. He had been ptnished wbile in the prison for bad behaviour. His conduct was described on the book as follows :-Millbank, very bad; Dartmoor, vary bad; Bentonville, desperately bad; Portland, very bad. His punishments sinoe he had been in this prison were :-On the 26th of September was reported for refusing to work; 27th, the same; 28th, for loud talking and improper language to Dr. Baly, for which he was sen. tenced to ax day confinement in the refractory cell on bread and. wter, the third day full diet. On the 29th for attempting- to asault an officer in the refractory- celLhe was sentenoed to. seven days' bread and water; the fourth full diet. On the 11th of Deoember, for dirtying his oell and improper conduct in chapel, two days locked in refrac. tory ell, ond one day bread and water. On the 12th for shoutig and insolence to the offioers,- for which-he was removTdto the dark celL On the 16th. for tearing up the prsnrue,ad hreaking 30 panes of glass, three drys in the refractory ceD, on full diet On the 25th of December fr Iprperlaguage to governor and others, and asbaultn prisoners,24 houra handcuffed, and six days in therefratory cell, on bread and water; the fourth full diet. On the 283tb, for making a noise, ,30th for saouting at the top ofhis voice, 24 hours handcuffed. On the 2d of January last, for taing up his clothes, the bedclothes, and breakiing 24 panes of glass, 21 das in his own cel on bread and water; every third day ful diet, and 16s. 4d. of his money confiscatedtothepublic. On the 5th, for shouting end climbing up the ventilation shaft, placed in a canvass dress (strait-waistcoat) and handcuffed for an hour and a half. On the 7th,-for throwing his topcoat in the officers face, 24 hours handcuffed. On the 8th, for making a nuisance in his cell and destroyingthe prison property, 24hours in handcuffs. On the 17th, for destroying his Ehirt and threatening to hang himself, handcuffed. On the 25th, for destroying three blankets, two sheets, and one rug, 24 hours handcuffed. On the 26th, for allowing another prisoner to read a letter and using insulting language to Dr. Baly, not punished. On May 7, for abusive language to the surgeon, shouting from his cell window, breaking 48 panes of glass, destroying one frock and nine pairs of drawers, and throwing a pint of gruel over an officer, for which he was placed in handcuffs for restraint, and referred to Captain O'Brien one of the directors, who ordered 28 days mn his own celf on bread and water, with such intervals of full diet as the surgeon thought proper. While in his ceU on hlay the 9tb, for committing a nuisanace, not punished, On the 10th, for destroying hisshirt and tying it round his neck, and threatening to commit suicide, 24 hours in hand. cuffs. On the 20th, forthrowing a pint of water over the resident-surgeon, not punished. On the same day, for breaking 20 panes of glass, 24 hours handcuffed. AlU the furniture was removed from his celL. On the 24th of May he ruptured himself, and an operation was yerformed, and he died on the 26h . Did not think he was insane. A Juror.-Yon say he was not mad Do you not tbink the torturing conrse adopted by placing him in irons, with only bread and water, was enough to drive him mad? Captain Craig.-Certainly not. The Juror.-I have a different opinion. The coroner said the jury might ask anyquestions, bntnot give opinions till they returned their verdict. Thomas Stanmore, princpalinfirmary warder, proved that at about 1 o'clock en unsday he saw the deoeased haging to the bars of his cell window by his hands, and calling to witness by name with an opprobrious epithet. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon witness heard thathe had injured himself, and he was admitted into the infirmary. By theJary.-When deceased ws looking out of his Vind ow he was seven feet from the floor. He could have got up there by standing on the hammock-hook. There was no furniture n the cell except a bucket for him to sit on. Witnessthonght he was doing it with the intentionito make a disturbance. William Turner, warder, proved having charge of the deceased, and he had witnessed some of the punishments. On the Sunday he received a report that he was sick, and went to the cell and removed him to the infirmary. Witness mentioned, among other punishments, one for attempt. ing to oommit suicide on the day that he was admitted. Captain Crai slained that he had overlooked that in the book in giving his evidence. Tarner, in answer to the juTy, said that when under punishment he took his bread and water without complainng It was for punishment that he was handcuffed. Mir. Joseph Egerton Savory, the resident surgeon, said he had had deceased under his charge ever since his appointment, on the 13th of May. As deceased was under punish3hent witness had seen him every moning, and never saw any necessity for altering his diet. He was on bread and water on the 28 days' pinmsment. By the Coroner.-The allowance of bread was ]6 oz. of bread per day to a penal-clss man, and a pint of water. The witness then went at great length into Eeveral matters in which deceased'hadsaid heliad diarrhcea and other complaints, which turned outto be false, Deceased was not at all wasted in body. When deceased was brought into the infirmary he was also seen by Dr. Baly. Deceased was suffering from astrangulation ef the intestines. He said he did not knowhowit was done, but from inquiries made of the officers he found that deceased had hung by his arms to the bars to look through the window, and there was nothing more likely to cause the injury than doing so. Witness was told that in the presence of deceased, and ho did not deny it. There was no external bruise, exoept a swelling across thshernia. Witness usedeveryremedytoreducethe swelling,butwithout avail, and, afteraconsulationwith Dr. Baly, it wCs decided to perform an operation. This was done by Mr. Henry, of Middlesex Hospita;; but, although port wine, brandy, beef ta, egg uddings, and other nourishment were administered, he n, and died on Tuesday morning at 6 o'clock. He had opened the body, and found death had arisen from inflammation of tho bowels and peritoneum. By the Coroner.-The injury must bave been caused by some great violence. By the Jury.-He could subsist 28 days on bread and water. Captain Craig, in answer to a juror, said the 28 days' punishment was given by the director. The juror thought the director had not the power. The Coroner readl a clause in the prison rules, framed on the Act of Parliament, showing that a dhiector could, after hearing matters on oath, give a prisoner punishment not exceeding 2l days, or corporal punishment. Captain Craig said deceased had never received corporal punishment in the prison. Hle had at Portland. The following verdict was thou recorded -" That the deceased died from inflammation of tho bowels and perito. neum caused by rupture."
THE MAINE LIQUOB LAW AND TEETOTALISf. I -------_ TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have felt some surprise in reading your excellent leading article of Tuesday last on the subject of the Maine Liquor Law to find no allusion whatever to the theological bearings of the question, or, if the reference to "pious indignation" a' Exeter-hall be such an allusion, to find it assumed that such indignation would, of course, be in favour of the law, and against those who would oppose its introduction into this country. It is, however, on account of its thoroughly unscriptural and antiscriptural character that I myself, in common with, I believe, the large majority of the clergy anrd others who frequent Exeter-hall, look with suspicion, not to use a stronger word, on " the aqueous theories of the partisans of total abstinence." I believe, Sir, that not only " the ex. perience of mankind," but the voice snd uniform tenour of the Scriptures are against them. The statements of total abstainers amount not seldom to a virtual libel on the Divine Author of Christianity. who in His own sojourn among men was stigmatized as a wine. bibber. With- theso enthusiasts it is a very disagreeable fact that His first miracle was the making of wine, although this fact would not distress them so much bat for another which proves that the wines vith which our Lord was conversant were alcoholiEc in their nature, as otherwise they would not have been "better" for being "old," nor would they have burst the bottles but for the procoss of fermenta. tion. It is a significant fact, too, that while the Apostles constAtly warned men against drunkenness, and shut out the impenitent drunkard from atl hope of salvation, they nowhere caution us against drinking wine, except in " excese.." The passage whicb, perverted, is tho main piUar of teetotalsm-" It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything," &c.-has reference to offerings and oblations to heathen deities. I have no doubt that, had the question of consciencebeen the abstract lawfulness of drinking wine at all, the Apostles would have settled it at once by pointing to Christ's own practice. The vegetarian, who conscientiously objects to the slaughter of animals, may just as reasonably ask rme, in deference to his conscience, to forego the use of animal food henceforward. As to the argument that sober persons should pledgo themselves totally to abstain for the sake of others, lot those who use it apply it, as they might, to the discourage. ment of other vices, and they will be ashamed of it, In my opinion, the extensive adoption of this argument is au evidenoe of the want of a due abhorrenoe of the vioe itself of drunkenness. I have no doubt this letter, if you print it, 'will stir up a great deal of indignation, so probably has your article on a kindred subject-thst of tho Maine Liquor Law; but those who will " wasWt it ought to make some allowance for the indignation which others feel at bein accused of anderrating the evil because they do not agree with toetoWlers as to the meons for its mitigation. I am, Sir. sour conatsnt ,rdi.r A CLERGYMAN, .may zu. JfLIE AD3MIST&RATON O.

The houses aore much improved and daily improving; the keepers are of a better class, and theaccommodation provided for the poor, without .eiDg dearer, is, in all respects, of a higher standard. Cases are addueecL to illustrate tho nature and extent of the evils arisg inL houses not controlled by law. 14,570 keepers have been, served with " notices to register," and. 6,292 of these hoseshave beensurveyed and measured toaccommnodate 91,106per. sons; Z355 houses have been "permanently" register;d, and ae used as common lodginghouses, wholly or in pitt6,275 houses, unfit for registration, have been given u p 3,897 caal houses are under strict supervision. The number of model lodginghouses is 104, accommodating 9S9 families, and 882 single persons.
