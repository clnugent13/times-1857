The Bank Charter ACT Of 1844.
TEB BANK GARTAM ACT OF 1844.
TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES.
Sir,-It is needless to say anything of the importance of the question in regard to the act of 1844. Perhaps some few modifications may be advautageously made in its details, but I am strongly impressed with the conviction- that nothing can be doue to modify its principle that will not be mischievous. It is intended to insure she constant equality of notes and coin, and it accomplishes that grand object in the least onerous way.
The act of 1814 assames that the paper currenoy of the country can never, under any ordinary condition of somiety, or under any mere commercial vicissitudes, be reduced below a certain amount, which it fixes for England at 14,000,0004. sterling. Perhaps this limit might be raised to 15,000,000& or 16,000,0001. without any risk of its boing over attained. Bat it is not easy to see why Government should treat any portion of this fixed issue as a part of the national debt, and pay the Bank 3 per cent. interest thereon. This, however, is what they do with about 11,000,0001. thereof; though as the Bank makes a profit, probably of about 3 per cent. bythe issue of notes, she might, one should think, be fairly called upon to allow Government to participate in such profits by reducing the interest paid on the debt due to her to 1, or at most 112 per cent. This modification, aupposing it were adopted, would be advantageous for the public, while it would in no degree trench on the principle of the act of 1844, or impose any improper hardship on the Bank.
But, whatever limit may be adopted for what may be caled the secured portion of the paper currency, it is to be hoped that Parliament will hold fast by the cardinal principle that for every additional 51. note taken into circula. tion, there shall be five sovereigns lodged in the bank. While this rule is essential to the certainty of paper being convertible at the pleasure of the holders, and is a great obstruction to its being issued in excess, it has the further advantage of not imposing any hardship of any kind whatever on any one. Our currency is constituted on the principle that al debts above 40s. shaU be paid in gold. But debtors have the option, should they prefer it, to exchange gold for bank-notes, and to make use of the latter in their dealings with the public. If A or B goes to the issuers of paper, and gets 100 or 500 notes from them in exchange for an equivalent amount of gold, it is his own convenience he has exclusively in view. He was at full liberty to use gold, but he preferred exchanging it for notes, because he could employ the latter more advantageously. This is the way in which paper is issued under the act of 1844; and, ruch being the case, it is plainly contradictory and absurd to say that it is productive either of hardship or inconvenience.
It is alleged, indeed, that the new system i3 injurious by shackling the Bank in the use of its credit. But it must be clear on the least reflection that it does nothing of the sort. It merely prevents the Bank from issuing substitutes for money which donot represent money. It does not absorb or lockup a single sixpence worth of her capital; nor does it interfere in any manner of way with her employment either of it or of her credit. The gold in the issue department of the Bank was not purchased by her, and does not belong to her. She is its keeper, but not its owner. It belongs to the public, or to the holders of bank-notes, who deposited it in the Bank in exchange for notes, with and under the express stipulation that on paying the latter into the Bank they should receive back their gold. Any interference with these deposits would be an interference with property held in plodge for others,-that is, it would bean act precisely of the same kind with that which subjected Strahan, Paul, and Co. to transportation for 14 years.
But though they may not lay violent hands on the property of the public, the Bank, it is obvious, has at this moment the same absolute command over her entire capital aud credit that she would have were the act of 1844 non-existent. In her banking capacity she is in precisely the same situation as any other banking or mercantile establishment. She may lend or not lend as she pleases, and may lay down such conditions as she pleases in regard to the interest and the terms of her loans. In short, she may do whatever she likes with her own, But further she is not permitted to go. She Is not to substitute shadows for realities. If she makes ad.
vances in money they must be made, like those of other j parties, in coin or in paper representing deposits of coin And to go a step further than this would be, disguise it as you will, to authorize an issue of fictitious or spuriou paper, and oonsequently to vitiate the currency, and tou abuse creditIn the waythat is sure to be in the endthe most disastrous.
The statement now made shows the absurzdity of the charge which is often made against the act of 184, that under its operation the Bank runs the risk of being brought to a stop, though she may have some five, six, or even eight milions bullion In her coffers. But it is plain that two things which are quite distinct, and have no necessary connexion with each other,--viz., the proceedings of the Bank in her capacity of issuer of notes, and her proceedings in her capacity of a banking company,-are confounded in this charge. In her former capacity it is all but impossible that she should be brought to a stop ; and if such a thing should happen, there would not be an ounce of bullion in her coffers. It is not, however, impossible, nor is it, perhaps, extremely improbable, that the Bank should be brought, in her mercantile capacity, into difficulties, while there is a large amount of bullion in the issue department But, though such should be the case, is that any reason why sho should be permitted to draw on what does not belong to her? Strahan, Paul, and Co. were in difficulties when they sold the bonds and other securities intrusted to their care. And supposing the Bank were in difficulties, is she to be allowed to right herself by setting aside the principle of uneum and tuum, and seizing on what belongs to others ? Her directors would be the first to repudiate such a mon strous doctrine. MIost likely it is popular among the founders and managers of the Royal British Bank and their associates and admirers here and elsewhere, bat it will be contemptaously rejected by every one who has any sense of honour or regard for character.
The facility with which fictitious paper might be issued previously to 1844 was on many occasions greatly abused, and, by giving a powerful stimulus to speculation and over trading, promoted in no ordinary degree, if it did not originate, those periods of artificial prosperity that never fail to terminate in bankraptcy and ruin. The comn mercial vicissitudes that have taken place since 1844 have been incomparably less severe than those which occurred prior to that epoch, and for this inestimable advantage we are mainly indebted to the aot of that year. But no one ever said or supposed that the act of 1844, or any other possible act, would free us entirely from commercial vicissitudes. Its object was to insure the equalization of gold and paper. And though it has completely effected this great end, we are still necessarily left to contend with such evils as may resalt from the occasional prevalence of mistaken views on the part of the publc, or of great estblishments like the Bank of Engiand. And these, no doubt, may be very severe. But while, on the one hand, the bubble of unnatura prosperity is no longer in'fated,
iS was formerly the case to a vast extent, by issues of spurious paper, so on the other the suffering and distress caused by the subsequent revulsion, are no longer inflamed and aggravated by their withdrawal or destruction.
The truth is that no commercial crisis has been, or can be, averted by makiDng issues of fictitious paper. On the contrary, by improperly bolstering up parties not entitled to credit, and by preventing that timely contraction of the currency which is necessary to correct an adverse exchange, they invariably tend to increase the mischief they are meant to alleviate. To tamperr with the currency, whatever may be the supposed exigenoy of the case, is a totally inexcusable proceeding. Having adopted gold for the standard of our money, it is our bounden duty to keep, at aUl hazards, such paper as is made legal tender, or is substituted for gold, on a parvwith it. Indeed, itwould be quite as correct to say thata commercial crisis may be mitigated by a change in our measures of length, capacity, or weight, as by a change in our measure of value.
Bills of exchange, about which so much is said, though they servo some of the purposes of money, are not money. But whether the amount of them in circulation be great or small, and whether they be drawn at long or short
dates, though highly important in other respects, has no reference to, or bearing upon, this question. When from any cause, whether from an excess in the amount of bills or of notes afloat, the currency becomes redundant, the exchange is depressed, and notes are sent to the Bank to be exchanged for gold, which is forthwith exported. And it is by the immediate action of the adverse exchange upon notes, and the consequent influence of the contrac. tion of the latter upon bills, that the amount of the currency is lessened, its value raised, and the exchange brought to par. At such periods there is usually more or less of mereantlle pressure and a greater demand for discounts and pecuniary accommodation. This leads to a rise in the rate of interest; but no ehange in this rate of interest has any I influence over the currency, except in so far as its rise may Adiminish and its faU may increase the demands upon the tBank for loans. A system of this sort effectualy prevents any great excess of bills from ever getting into the market,
and thus checks in imitc what would otherwise be the most copious source of wild speculation, overtrading& and bank. ruptcy.
The operation of the present system during the late war 'was In all respects eminently satisfactory. It stood in the way of no legitimate transaction, of no fair exercise of the credit either of the State or of individuals. But as it was a powerful obstacle to the creation of artificial eredit, it *ss
eminently unpopular with those wiho suppoeed they would profit by such abuse. It isdoubtful, had the war continued for two or three years longer, whether Government might not have been compelled to resort to in inoonvertible paper, andiconsequently to place the propertr of the public and of every Individual at the moroy of its issuers.
From all one sees aud heas it is probable that the main objection to the renewal of the act of 1844 will be that it aggravates the severity of any crisis or pressure that aay .ccur. And then it is said that, admitting it to be sound in principle, it should not be carried to an extreme, but should admit of being occasionally relaxed. Now, with respect to these matters it may be observed:-
1. That the practical effect of the act of 1841 is to do what other acts professed but failed to do,-that is, to make paper and gold precisely of the same value, and to insure the immediate conversion of the former into the latter. This is all that the act of 1844 really does; and to say that it aggravates either pressure or distress is equivalent to saying that it is aggravated by employing a metalhc currency, or by maintaining a measure of value which is practically invariable. Now, this is plainly absurd. A gold ourrency interposes no obstacle to the free transfer of cipital from one party to another, and has in truth no influence of any sort over its distribution, its employment, or the rate of profit. How, then, can it either occasion distress or add to its pressure? It is not difficult to discover in the destruction of capital occasioned by the late war, in the hoarding now going on in most parts of the continent, in the extraordinary extension of commerce, and in the various schemes afloat the causes of the present high rate of interest. But whatever they may be the equality between gold and paper in England cannot be one of them. Neither can it be said to be occasioned by a iscarcity of gold, for we are exporting it to aU parts of the continent; and interest is more than three times as high in Califomnia, and more than twice as high in Australia, in both of which gold is comparatively cheap, as in the United Kingdom.
It is quite truo that if the check on the issue of paper were less cogent than at present; parties might be tempted to lend it at less than 6 or 7, or even 4 per cent. But the currency is already full, as is shown by the exportation of gold; and hence it is obvious that the issues now referred to, supposing them to be made, would, by increasing it stil further, make it stiU more redundant; and would thus, by depressing the exchange to a stll greater extent, proportionally increase the drain for gold. Every device of this sort,-that is, every Attempt to obviate a drain by encroaching on the integrity of the currency, is sure to lead to mischief. It may, like drams administered to a person with a broken-down constitution, have a momentary effect, but the collapse is inevitable, and is sure to be ruinous in proportion to the previous abuse of the seimulant.
Owing, in great measure, to the prudence with which the affairs of the Bank have been administered for the last few years, tbere is at present no mercantile distress. But, though It had been otherwiso, it would not have affecekd this question. That distress might, perhaps, have been momentarily alleviated by loans of fictitious paper, or of paper issued in excess. But unlcs the principle of convertibility were to be thrown to the dogs, this alleviation wouldbetemporary only, and would be purchased at a heavy cost. At best it might enable a fow bankrapt or ricketty concerns to weather the storm for a while, and to get deeper into debt and difficulties; and for this advantag,e,
if so we may caU it, the exchange would be stil more de-, pressed, and the surface and the channels of suffering be widened and deepened. The giving of alms in the street is not half so bad, as a means of suppressing pauperism, as the attempt to relieve mercantile distresses by adding to the supphes of paper. It is like attempting to obviate the mischiefs arising from a deficient harvest by lessening the size of the busheL
On the whole, therefore, it is clear that the act of 1844 does not, and cannot, add to mercantile distress; while by preventing the issue of spurious paper, or of paper in excess, it has a powerful influence in preventing hazardous speculation, factitious prosperity, and the subsequent recoiL It would be easy to show that it contributed, in a very high degree, to the facility with which we have met the drain occasioned by the late war and the pressure of the high rate of interest.
2. But it is said that, " admitting all that you allege, stiU even the best system cannot always be carried to an extreme. The act of 1844 had to be suspended in 1847, and the means of relaxing it in periods of necessity shouid be provided for !" This " dodge" wiU probably be attempted in one shape or other, and if it succeed it will be fatal. The suspension of the act in 1847 is admitted on All hands to have been a measure of very doubtful policy. The ex. changes had already become favourable, and the prevalent opinion in the best-informed quaters isthatthe panio would speedily have disappeared withont the intervention of Government. But whether this opinion be right or wrong is little to the purpose. The act of 1844 is a rule of action Intended, like the Habeas Corpus Act, to be uniformly enforced, exeept in extraordinary and unforeseen ciroumstances, the urgency of which cannot be determined beforehand. If once it were admitted that the suspension of the act of 1844 may be looked for whenever pecuniary pressure becomes pretty severe, aU confidence in the stability of our monetary system-that is, In our maintaining the measure of value inviolate-wouldbe atan end. It would, under such eircumstances, be seen that it depended entirely on the self-reliance and firmness of the Government of the day; and when that is the case tle probability is we shall not be long tiU we have a papEz milennium. The entreaties of political friends, the desire to make or preserve a party in the House of Commons, and the plausible sophistries with which every invasion of principle wil be varnished over, wil be irresistible. And when tte IRubicon has been crossed where are we to stop in the downward descent ? The present crisis, how trifling soeverit may be, wiU always be said to be the most serioust that has ever occurred; and what Lord This did to carry a point will not be repudiated by Lord That. On this ground any attempt to pLae the issue of notes in the hands of commissioners should be reso! Ately opposed. The chances are ten to one that in the event of their being tppointed they would be mere tools of the Government of the day. It should never be forgotten that the time when the act is said to be working harshly and oppressively is the very time when it is most indispensable that it should be honestly carried out.
Nothing would be gained by meddling with the local cir. culation as it now exists. Though objectionable In theory, it is productive of little inconvenience, and to attempt to suppress it would provoke a clamour that might be injurious to, or prevent the prolongation of, the act.
It is rumoured in certain quarters that the question in regard to the renewal of the act of 1844 is to be submitted to the consideration of commlttees of both Houses; but I would fain hope that there is no foundation for this rumour. What is there to inquire into? The whole matter is quite as weU understood at this moment as it can be 12 months hence. The appointment of committees might be a'propriate enough were it intended to give the matter the go-by; but it is not one that can be indeSnitelv postponed, it must be dealt with one way or other. And such being the case, I should like to know what good purpose is to be served by examining crowds of contradictory and generaUy incompetent witnesses, and printing cartloads of us,elss returns. This is a case in which nothing is left for a committee to discover. Government should at once introduce a biUl embodying its views upon the subject, and if the continuance of the act of 1844 be the grand object of that bill there can be little doubt of its being s, Rilv
passe&w mto a law.

Middle Class Education In The West.-Great
AMIDDLE CuAss EDUCATION IN THE WEST.-Great efforts are being made by several noblemen and gentlemen of high standing in Devonshire to promote A scheme of educatioxx which hais beenp~ropounded by Mr. Thomas Dyke Acland, eldest son of Sir T. D. Acland, for the practical education of the middle cla;es in the West of tegland. Sir S. H. Northcote, M.P., the Hon. W. W. Addington, the Mayor of Exeter (Mr. Bucnkiigham), and the Rev. Chancellor Harington were among those who attended a 'eetin a few days ago to consider the shemed and its as reportea that Lrd Courtenay, Sir T. De Acland, M.P., Sir J. iennaway, Sir F. Rogers, Mr. S. T. lKerlewich, and other gentlemen, had expressed their concurrence therein. It is stated in the programie issued by the asociation that while the education ot the upper cilases is promoted by the recent improvements in the universities and the examination-tests in public schools, and that of the lower classes is zealously aided by the exertions of the benevolent, and ly Government grantsi, "the iddle classes bear the whole cost of the education of their own children, and that they derive less aid from ancient endowments and from the publc purse than any otherbranch of the commusity." It is, therefore, intended to offer prie for compatir ton to boys educatea in the West of England, with a haw to employments in agrculture, arts, manufactures, and commerce, the objects ained at being a ggod general education, in conformitywiththe common opinionof Englishmen, that skil inlhfrming, handicraft and trade is best acquired by tractice. At the annual meeting of theExeter Literary Society, Sir S. Northcote advocated the schem,adi a already received a large and e me,rain raandite hasup
portfrommen f vaious ositions In li.'e and of different rehous creeds. With the view to promote the education of tle agr.icultural body, Lord Ebrington has offered a prize i*~ompetition to the sons of farmers, the subjects in which they are to be examined being English literatur% history, siXaWematies. &c.
RAJOOTANA.-We have been requested to state ,that the declaration in the Calcidta Alor7n-ing Chronicle and other Indian papers, to the effect that orders bave gone out fron the Court of Directors to " annex"' the Raipootana States on the first convenient opportunity, is wholly destitute of truth. The pretended despatcb of " July 1., 1&56," is entirely fabulous, and no despatch to the above or any similar effect has everbeen even contemplated. In fact the policy of the home authorities in respect to the ncipalities of Eaipootana has been and is of a diametricaly opposite character.
Mr. Charles Pearson Upon Penal Punishments.
AM, CHAILES PEARSON UPON PENAZ
PUNLSZtBNTS.
Mr. Charles Pearson, the City Solicitor, has addressed a communication to tho Lord Mayor, in which he embodies li opinions upon penal punishment, including prison discljtine, transportation, and the ticket-of-leave s"stem. In tims communication Mr. Pearson gives an elaborate sketch of the policy adopted towards eriminals from the 16th to the present century, commenting upon its barbarity and general results, ciLting authorities anid facts, and proceeds to give hi views upon penal punishments gener ly. He clases them under three heads :-L The system of past days, or the cheap and cruel system. 2. The present, or the expensive and effeminatesystem. 3. The future, or the relf.supporting system. Referrinig to the first head, Mr. Pearson dilates upon the cruelties to which transports were subjected in former times, and proceeds thus with the second head:
"gSecond.-The present or the expensive and effeminate system.-This system, wich is generally known as the separate or cellular or solitary system, was invented by some .ts Phla xntr20Pats inAmnericr It was imported into
tln about Years ago by M1r. Crawford, an able and intellgent gentleman, appointed Prison Inspector by the British Government. It was designed to supersede the old
discipline da transportation systems. Reading and rentonvillepnrisons were erected to serve as models for all cla&ses of criminals The system is thus pithily described by its most able and zealous advoeate, the chaplain of Reading Gaol, who thus observes, 'The essentials of the separate system are seclusion as a punishment, labour as s relaxation, and sc tural instruction as a corrective,' as explained by the regations and illustrated by the practice of the gaol
The casplain's short description may be thus translated into
nla he sepadate system criminals are to have a great a o soltude, a great deal of 'ictuals, a great deal of warmth, a pqeat deal of sleep a great deal of mental instrction, a great deal of religious teahing, with a very little exercise, and labour sufficient only for the purposes of recreative relaxation. By the combmed influences of these corporeal, mental, and religious agencies it was assumed by the enthusiastic advocates of the system that the hearts of criminals would be softened, their unruly wills subdued, their minds would be enlightened, their souls converted, and theirlives reformed. It was, moreover, said by its advocates that by unitiDg secresy with solitude, by placing criminals in cells so constructed as to exclude both sight and sound, by hooding and masking them when led out to chapel or exercise, and by changing their name fora letter by which they were tobe known from their admission into prison up to the time of their discharge, that by a lite secresy and good management a prisoner night upon his release maintain his incognito. It was said the world would forgive or forget his crimes, and he might go abroad as an exile or bo restored to slciety as having completed his penal punishment, or be releaed in this country on a ticket of leave.
"It was confidently affirmed by the eulogists of the system that, although its first oost and annual outlay wereconsiderable, it would be presently found that the number of prisoners would be so much reduoed from the effects of its reformatory influence that a considerable saving would be effected by the country in prisons and prosweutions as soon as its deterring and reformatory treatment was known and felt.
" Your Lordship heard me, several years ago, in the presence of a number of its most talented advocates, ridicule what I termed the absurdities, and denounce what I considered the serious evils of the system. I once heard Lord Brougham exDress himself on this subject, but experience bas proved, as I never failed to predict would be the case, that the study of mental religion and theoretical virtue, as tught in these prisons, has not had, and will not have, any practical effect in diminishing either the number of prisoners committed to our gsols or the number of crimes they may be tempted to commit when they get without their walls.
"Solitude has its peculiar vices and evils as well as society; manis for good as weU as for evil a social being, and this unnatural, unsodcltreatment has often, very often exercised a most baneful effect, as weU upon the body as the mind of those who are for any length of time subjected to its action. The laws of nature cannot be outraged with impunity; walls ndbolts and bars cannot shut the devil out irom his own favourite workshop-the heart of an idle man.
" As an instrument of lengthened punishment for grave offences the separate system is pregnant, as I have elsewhere observed, with evils of an opposite character according to circamstances not at all affecting the criminal, either before his imprisonment or while in gaoL Its severity or laxity in such cases is dependent upon the agencies by which It is intended to be carried out."
Mr. Pearson then adduces evidence of persons connected with prisons in support of his views upon solitary confine. ments, and proceedsto the thirdhead of his subject.
" To arm iociety with powers of self-defence against crimes of violence and plunder, by compelling hardened criminals to maintain themselves by labour in industrial prisons, from which they cannot escape and will not be released, Is the object of what I venture to hope wll become the future system of prson discipline. I term that system for shortness the ' labour and appetite system' the leading characteristics of which I will now proceed to describe.
" The future,or manly and self-sustaining-the labour and appetite system of prison discipline professes to be founded upon the word of od, as given to mankind in both the Old and the New Testament. The first sentence of penal punishment ever pronounced upon man was a labour and appetite sentence. It was psaseaby Almighty Wisdomupon a guilty race in language which, for sublimity and beauty, Is not surpassed by any other sentence in that sacred book.
Ithe sweat of -thy face shalt thou eat broad tiU thou return unto the ground, for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return. Happily for the world God did not leave the execution of this sentence of penal punishment to man's voluntary obedience. To secure its observance, the face of nature and the physical constitution of man were entirely changed. Appetite for food and rest, essential conditions of this penal sentence, become daily recurring stimulants to obedience which no human contrivance can anticipate or postpone, Christianity is said by lawyers to be part and parcel of the law of England, and the precepts of the Bible are assumed to be the basis of our vitten and unwritten laws, and yet all our systems o'; penal punishment ignore the teaching of God's wora, which so plainly points to the association of labour and appetite in the punishment and repression of crime. The means and appliances by which I propose to give a practical application to the principles foreshadowed in these quotations m founding a comprehensive system of prison discipline were developed in minute detail by myself and several witnesses. I was examined before the House of Commons Committee to which I have already referred. Sir J. Pakington moved, Sir G. Grey supported, and the committee unanimou^sly adopted a resolution upon this subject.
"As the ticket'oi-leave substitute for the plan which the committee recommended to the consideration of Her Majesty's Government must force itself upon the attention of the House at the very eommencement of the ensuing session, we shall learn what has been done by the Home SecretTry between 1850 and 1857 towards the examination of the extensive details which the committee were unable to Investigate for want of sufficient time for the purpose; one thing only remains for me to shy,-I have never been summoned before any committee or commission appointed to conduct such an inquiry. The other witnesses, who were prepared with plans, drawings, and estimates to confirm their former statements, inform me that they have never been called upon to offer any further observations or to submit themselves to any other examination. As far, therefore, as I am informed, the Government have allowed the plan to remain entombed in a blue blook which I hnve just ascertained weighs 56lb. avoirdupois. If the report and evidence be permitted to slumber in the vages of tiat monster blue-bool, they might as weU havebeen buried under the pyramids of BEypt. Ihope, however, before the subject is ventilated in theoouse that the public will have before them a cheap edition of this and other documents necessary to beconsidered in discusaingthe important questions of prison discipline and penalpunishment, questions that have now forced themselves upon public attention, and upon which action in some one direction or another can no longer be either resisted or postponed.
" The expense in the cost and management of our prisons is so excessive under the existing system that the State is obliged to sanction the passlng o ahort sentences, and the Government is om ed to resort to tickets of leave and other temporizini expedients still further to abridge the actual sentences of the law. Ff judges and magistrates were to pass such sentences as they n their consciences believe to be necessary to effect any sold reformation in the mind of the criminal, the rison accommodation throughout the country must be doubled to provide for the additional number that would constitute the average prison popula-
"If there is at the command of Her Majesty's Government so large an amount of confiscated labour, which the State bas aright to claim and apply to its own use, why should not this be done, particularly so if it can be proved that such an qpll tion of the labour of criminal would be made conducive to their moral and social reform as well as to their maintenance and support ? There is one, and only one way, in my opinion, by which this object may be effected, and that is by making it a condition of prison discipline that the labour and appetite sentence shall be strictly appled in all cases where the hcalth and strength of the prisoner will admit.
" The proposed plan for sacomplishingthese objects asdescribed to the committee contemplated the establishment of Large idustral prisons, secure and strong, plain and cheap with separate sleeping el'ls for each inmate. The prison to be surrounded b,y strong and lofty wals, enelosng 1,000 or ,?000 acres of land. I propose that each of these urisons
nan aacc-ommodato 1,000 -or ,2.00 O-in-ma-t-es, classifie, subclassified, nd distributed in different prisons awcrcoing to
theireconomicAl cOndition whether aTtisans,mechanics, or labourers; According to th'eir physical state, their age, and strength; according to their mnoral and legal status; -whether felons or misdemeanants under longer or shorter sentences, and whether hardened offenders or novics in crime. By having one suporintending power to deal with the large fund of labour of our prison population, means woud readily be obtained for a most perfect system of classification-legal, moral social, and economical-for the purpose of meeting all the various objects I have descritbed so that the mnutual contamination of prisoners might b prevented, discipline might be enforced, and the separation of the prisoner-one of the farst objects of the systemmight be pomoted, at the same time'that justice would be done to thle ratepayer by turning the confiscated labouLr of the criminal t the beat and most profitable account. When the proposed plans for the Iclassification of prisoners is complete, I propose that they shall, as neary as economical considerations and prison arrangements will admit, be employedinthe pursusts at which they are mnost apt, ad to which. they wif be returned At the termination of their senatences" -
lr. earson then enters into some details respecting his plan, and concledes as follows- T
eMy uord Msyor,-It will be said, I dare say, as the Parliamentary commnittee reported of my proposed plan, that ' many dioiulties would probably arise under a discussion of its details,' aLnd therefore a dispostion may exist in some quarters to pspone its consideration for another seven year.

"Kingsford And Swinford V. Merry."
" KINGSFORD ANTD SWINFORD F. ArZZRR."
.tI'A publc meeting of merchants, bankers, brokers, and
other tra ,convened by the Association for Promotin the Interests of the Traders of the Port of London, was hola at the London Tavern, at 1 o'clock yesterday, for the purpose of considering the anomalous state of the law consequen upon the recent decision of the Court of Error in the caseof "1Kingsford and Swinford v. Merry." Baron Lionel Rothschild, MLP., was called to the chair, and among the gentlemen present wero Sir James Dake, Al.P., Messrs. Weguein (Governor of the Bank of England), Gassiot, Travers, Gregson, MYP., Moffitt, M.P., . J. Hal, J. D. Powles, Cook, Archibald Hastie, M.P., Craw. ford, &c. In introducing the proceedings
The CHnmmmm said, that this being a mneeting of merchants, it behoved those who addressed them to bear in mind that their time was valuable. He should therefore endeavonr to set a good example hiaself by trespassing only a few minutes on their attention. The reason for calnng that meeting was known to 'hem all The decision of the Comrt of Exchequer in the case abovenamed had induced merchants to reflect on the state of a part of our commercial law of which they had been to aome extent ignorant. Particular attention had been drawn to the decision of the higher Court, owving to its being different from the decision of the Courts below. It was at firstthought that the law wasnot quite clear on the point at issue, but on consideration there was no doubt that conflicting judgments had been given, not on account of the law, butratheron account of different opinions as to the facts. The decision of the first Court was given because it was not quite clear that there was any fraud connected with the transactions in dispute' but, on fnrther evidence being subsequently produced, judglment was delivered under the belief that fraud had been proved. As far, therefore, as he could understand the matter, tho opinion of lawyers as to theexactstatoof the law atpresent waspretty decided and was to this effect-that holdersof bills of lading, delivery-orders, or dock-warrants, having gven full value for those documents, or having advanced money upon them, are not the legal holders or proprietors of the goods which they represent, unless they can prove that the title of every person through whose hands the warrants, &c., have passed is perfectly good. That, he believed, was at present theexact state of the olw; and it was for the meeting to consider whether itsho ldbeallowed to tremain so, or whether the Government shouldbe applied to with a viewto its alteration. Formerly the punic was protected against the moneylender, who in the dak ages was regarded as a I'sharper" and his calnng viewed with prejudice and distrust* but now, as the principle of protectionm had been done away with, it might fairly be asked why one class of men should be protected against the public at large, and why the original owner of the goods should b3 protected against the whole trading community. The case which had lately attracted so much attention, and had given rise to that meeting, was a very hacd one for the person who had advanced his money, though he had taken every precaution that a careful man could take. But all his precaution was of no Avail when tke law positively was against him, as it was in this instance. In fact, as the law now stood, all the care of the merchant would not shield him against the intentions of badly-disposed persons, or of persons who were detertermined-ho was almost about to say-to swear falsely. (Hear, hear.) It was obvious that if the law continued as it now was, and its condition was made public, more litigation would be engendered on this question than they had ever yet witnessed; because a great many persons were ignorant of the law and believed that these documents passed legally from hand to hand by being endorsed. But the fact being nowmade known that the case is different, the necessary result must be either that more vexatious litigati6n will be produced, or that so much precaution will have to be taken in the transaction of the business of merchants and bankers that the community at large must suffer serious inconvenience. Therefore, for the sake of checidnglitigation, preventing fraud, andfacilitating commerce generally, there could be no doubt that these documents ought to pass lega from hand to hand if r
perly endorsed and rperly o mtaed, and if it could b proved that value haU been given for them. (Hear, hear.) Perhaps he ought to have refrained as chairman from giving any very decided opinion on the point at issue, and to have contented himself with simply explaining the object of the meeting; yet he had felt that his own interests won.d not permit him to remain silent on the question, and he t: usted that he would be forgiven the expression of an opion in favour of a revision of the law. (Hear, hear.)
lr. SAmuzL GREGSOX,, MP., rose to move the first resolution, viz.
"Ttat the decision of the Court of rrorin the case of IKingsford and sinerdr v. Messy airpeara to InVOlve a principle which lacale
lated so sender thercognized and wellundesstco cousse and practice

He believed that every one present sympathized with Mr. Merry as an innocent sufferer by the recent decision of the Courtof Error (Hear, hear.) When the case first came on in the Court of Exchequer the Lord Chief Baron, with an honesty of purpose that was highly commendable, emphatically remarked that tf a botflnide transaction ike that was to be impeached, no man could be safe, and business could not be carried on in a great commerciai city hke London. (Hear, hear.) But it apsared that that learned judge, with all his honesty of feolng, was wrong in peo nt of lv, for, the Court of Error having reversed his
eason, there seemed to be no doubt in the opinion of the lawyers that the judgment of the Court of Error was in strict conformity with the law asu 1 now stood. Immediately after thisdjudment was given the idea of an appeal to the House of Loras s mooted, but that was afterwards thought to be useless, as the resent law on the subject was pretty clear as it now stood. the iudgment was, moreover, inaccordancewiththestatement of tord Campbellinaformer case,-namely, that a bill of lading would not pass as a biil of exchange or a promissory note, and that if it wore stolen or transferred without authority an advance made upon it could not benmaintained. The meeting had therefore to consider what change in the law was desirable. It might not be known by some that up to the year 182I no pledge was good, except by an owner. In 1826 the law was altered so as to give the pledger power in this way:-Previous to that date if he, residdngin India, sent a bill of lading to an agent in London, not drawing against it, and the agent obtained an advance, he could follow the goods, and the persan making the advance would lose his money. The alteration then made was to this effect, that if he, abroad, intrusted an agent in London with such a document, that would be quite sufficient authority for the public to make the aent an advance, as, if he trusted him, that would be enough to justify the pubEc in trusting him also. 'lhe law now in force required to be relaxed. Its prineiple was in accordance with that of the Pawnbrokers Act, which went to this, that no sale, exchange, or pawn of any goods wrongfuly taken deprived the owner of his property. Then came the delcate question how far dock-warrants should be alowed to circulate, even though the person presenting them to the party making an advance was fraudulent. Perhaps the meeting would hardly go so ar as to say that, under any circumstances whatever a person maldug an advance should be justified in holding the documents; for at the present time, when there was such a lamentable amount of fraud perpetrated, it seemed to be requisite that some precaution should be taken that the person making the advance should have a knowledge of the person requirig it (hear, hear), and some knowledge also that he has given a ond jdc value for the goods. If they let loose to the fullest extent the circulation of documents which might have been obtained by fraud, perhaps the evil thereby produced would be greater than the one they now sought to remedy. (Hear, hear.) It would evidently be utterly impossible if a warrant passed through a variety of hands-say, from A to Z-that Z could trace it through all its stages from A. StiUl, if it came to him with a reasonable ground for beheving that the party was respectable, and that value had been given for it, that would besufficient to entitle a person to retain the document and make an advance upon it. The hon. gentleman concluded by movinnthe resolutiori as above.
Mr. hIOFFArr, XLP., seconded the proposition, cordiaUy concurring in the remarks made by its mover and also by the chairman. In the last century warrants and delivery-orders became the great circulating medium of commerce, and they were dealt with daily in that city like bank-notes. Now, however, all of a sudden a doubt was thrown upon their validity. The consequent derangement and uncertainty were suoh that the promptest remedy was demanded, and the. necessity of an alteration of the law should be pressed on the attention of the Government without delay. At the same timo the mecting should take care not to rouse against them the gentlemen of the long robeby meddling with the Chattels Act and the Pawnbrokers Act. They should strictly confine their demand for legislation to documents relating to merchandise and the ordinary oDerations offcommerce. (Hear, hear.) It ought therefore to be an instruction to any committee to be appointed that its attention should be directed to this as solely a mercantile question, gravely affecting every trader connected with the mort and export of goods. If the decision of the Court of
r was nght, there was nothing to prevent the Chinese merchants (with regard to whose business there bad been rumours of extensive frauds) fron raising the question as to the validity of these warrants, and then coming down upon the gentlemen who held them for the restoratioa of their goods.
The resolution was then put and carried unanimously.
Mr. WEGuxLR rose to move the next resolution, viz"That a committec, consstin o Baron Rothschild, Mesr Gassiot, ressn, laU Scveu,ai ic w.Corns, Mofatt5ifodgeon, Craw' fm,cd Traers wth powecr to add to their number, be appainted to confcr writh the Government, in the viewof procuring, by legslative enactment, such a lul and final settlemnent of the state of tbe law as ,ball be calculated to afford due security to the neg"*iations of tride, and to protect the bong dde holder of those commercial documents,

-Mr. GREc.soss.-Merely to ascertain that the party bringing the document was a person known to himi, and that he had given value for it.
Mr. Waouzw?N continued.-Not, in fact, to render the document transferrible, as at present, like bills of exchange or baniknotes. Therefore this door would still be leftb open to litigation and the other evils of which they complained. (Her, ear) t wuldsurlybe ettr,while they were

jfcpurchaser of goods in what lawyera called market overt wa protected now, as he understdthe law. That was, if a warrant fraudulently obtained were nurchjasod by a mer. chant in market overt, he was legaUY Si titltid to those goods unless the person who had fraudulently obtainedI thsent was couvictea, and unless they had passed to a, secnd pur, chaser. Therefore auos the warrant or the delivery order to have been frau ulently obtained and to have beea purchased by a merchant on the Exchange, he had always the opportunity to ell the goods again before the person who fraudulently obtained the warrant originaly was convicted, and then the warrant remained good-it could not be followed beyond the first person. That he believed -was the prcsent state of the law. It made an extraordinary dig. tinction between things which in reality had no difference --namely, between the position of a person who bon4 i4 purchased a document of title and that of a persoa who made a bon4 dicfl advance on a document of title. He thought that both of these parties should be placed oa precisely tho same footing. Hear, bear.) He had been n communication with Mr. vie, vho took considerable; pains to ascertain the exact state of the law, and had draw
the short act which he now beld in his hand, embodying this principle-that documents of title connected with the transfer of goods should stand on the same footing as banknotes or bilis of exchange. (Hear hear) If there was a general expression of opinion on tfie part of the meeting that it was desirable to go thus far, an mstruction to that effect might be given to the committee about to be a
pointed.- Otherwise it was to be feAred that they wMIl not satisfactorily settle the matter. Any doubt on the minds of the committeeass to the length to which it was desirable to proceed might defeat their 'wilted action, and probably end in an imperfect issue. He would take the libe rty of reading one of the claudse of the proposed bill It declared;-" That any purchase -and any contract or agremen forthepurchase and xsle of -merchandise whic shll b bodcjd made by a purchaser in the ordnay cure f trade shall be as binding en the rue wnerof sch mrchadiae ad thea purha %srs an have the same right and title to the merchandise a2 the sale thereof or the contt for the sale were miwAey th true owner; provided the person who shaU make such sale or contract the possession of the merchandise at the time of the sale or contract, and sallU deliver over the mnerchandise to the buyer." (Hear, hear.)
Mr. J. D. PoWLEs, in seconding tho resolution, observed that their object as mercantile men was to have it settled and understood thnat the documents which they hadin their hands, and which wer3 lawfully iasued to them, did actually represent what they appeared to do by the words that were up n them. (Hear, hear.) They had a right to demand t,ht and they were entitled to expect that the lawyers woad not undermine the confidence of the commercial com. munity by broaching opinions the soundness of which the intellgent layman was unable to test. A warrant stating that so many bags of coffee belonged to a particular person went honestly into the hands of another atywho advanced 3meney upon it; and ye't thato etvhe party was to be told that some antecedent transaction, of which he had no possible cognizance, entirely vitiated the vahidity of the instrument I Nobody would deny tbata due discretion must be exercised in the conduct of business. If, for example, a livery.stable.keeper walked into a amer
chant's countinghouse in Mincing-lane, and asked for an advance uwpon sO many hundred bags of coffee, it would be a gross indiscretion for the merchant not to make due inquiry before embarking ina transaction so much out of the ordiarycouse o trde.Butwhnt all appearance the holderof a warrant had a natural and legitunato right to hold it, and when there was no possible means on the part of the lender of the money to know that he had not honestly acquired it, it was monstrous to say that such a transaction uhould not stand on a firm and legal foundation. Thin question must be settled in a way that would leave no loopholes for the dishonest to escape from their obligations. As to what had been said about guarding against fraud, he asked why the mercantile mind should be kept in a perpetual ferment through the uncertainty of the law, merely because it was just possible that in many thousand transactions one case of frauN might occur? It was said that the Court of Error reversed the decision of the court below upon astatement of facts different from that which came before the first tribunal ; but surely when a man went before a Court of Error he appealed on a statement of facts which bad come out before an were known to all the world. Nothing could be more calculated to disturb tho mercantile mind than that decision.
Mr. AsCSEALD HAsTIT, MLP., in supporting the resolu. tion was understood to illustrate the anomalous state of the 1aw by mentioning the fact that if a merchant's clerk weat to his employees iron cheat and took out surreptitiously a number of warrants, and then pledged them, the person from whom they were stolen would have a right to recover themi whereas if the same clerk had been entrusted with 40 or a0 warrants, and went and fraudulently pledged half of them, the law regarded it as a bon4d fe pledge.
Mr. GAsSIoT could not concur in the argument of the last speaker, the drift of which seemed to be in favourof offering facilities for burglary. (" No, no.") Their object was not to give increased facilities for fraud, but to remove those facities, b e legalizing hononrable transactions and making
th. wtrsaexplained that Mr. Gassiot had totally mistaken his meanin. His object was to strike at all descrip. tioas of frau d alke, and not at one description alone.
The resolution was then put and carried unanimously.
Sir JAMES DuKE, MP., in proposing the usual compli. ment to the chairman, said that ho had attended the inm wth much pleasure, as one of the members for the city, wth the view of collectinz the sentiments and wishes of hiconstittents. He hoped-that no long time would elapse before Baron Rothschild, also one of their representatives, would be enabled to support the intereats of the commercial community in the House of Commnns with as much efficiency as he had always supported them out of that assembly. (Hear, hear.)
The vote of thanks having been seconded by Mr. CRAW. FORD and passed by acclamation,
The CoARAM briefly acknowledged it, remarking that he was only sorry that he had not more freq,uent opportuniies of placing his humble services at their dispooaL He trusted, however, that one of these days he would be able to serve them as their representative intheHouse of Commons. (Hear, hear.) He had to thank them warmly for the support they had givea him on all occasion. (Hear, hear,)
The proceedings then terminated.

THE NEW AMERICAN TARIFF.-It is expected
THE Nw A.S%rmcIAN TABIFr.-It is expected that a discussion of the tariff will be commenced to-day in the House of Representatives at Washington. This discusion has already been avoided twice by the House-first in August last, and again in December. Yet there has been no subject of public interest, either in the lobby or on tke table of Congress, possessing a greater claim to an imune. diate, frank, and deliberato examination than the tariff; and, whatover prudential reasons may have existed hereto. fore to Justif this postponement, there is evidently no reason nLow why the tariff question should b cin be ihirked, or its consideration crowded further into the future. Our industrial interests are too vast and too important to be pl?yed with longer by politicians, and the sooner our tariff is pernanently adjusted on a financial rather than a politioal basis tLe better will it be for the whole country. The rival theories of free trade and protection, when set forth as the fundamental and inflexible prin. ciples of a national tariff, are *bsurdities. As theories merely they are good for party effect, but as t weeDing s. tems, applicable toeveryaspect of commerce an e they are entirely sinpracticable in the United States. It is quitie right that in framinng a tariff for this country sEuch a policy should be adopted as will tend to etstbligh our industrial independence. For this end the nature, history, and industrial value o£ every *rticle that we import from foreign countries should be examinod separately and its rate of duty should be detern,ined according to its individual circumtances. The natural result of this proceeding will be the adoption of a t hich opens to free trade those raw materials on rwh onr own labourmay be most largely and advantageously employed, and all articles of general nscessity which are exotics, or which are produced only in small quantities in the ijnited States. At the saue time such a tarff willestablish a protection for our own industry i v.xing those manfacturedarticles of foreign countries t.he i nportation of which tends to destroytheir manufacture here, and thus impoverish our own labour. tariff formed on thuFe principles wiU aoco hplis what is now universally needtd-theestablishment

MONBY-MABKBT and 07TYINTELLIGENOffl,
Monday Evening.
lhe English funds opened this morning at the final prices of Saturday, and subsequently experienced a further depression, from which there was ultimately a partial recovery. The first transactions in Consols were at 93i to - for money, whence they receded in the middle of the day to 93t to e. The latest quotations, however, were 930 to t for money, and 9acc to :* for the 5th of February.
Ihe exportation of bullion and the consequent apprehension that the Bank may contemplate new restrictions still constituted the chief causes of the tendency to dulnesi, but the probable expenses of thePersian war, which, according to precedent, will be met in equal procortions by the home Government and the East India Company, and also the uncerta2iny as to the results of the Chines
demonstration, are points wbich contribute to check any return of animation. There is likewise an expectation that a sum maybe required to be raised to meet the intended capitalization of the Sound Dues. B3ank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 93Qto ur; New Three per Cents., 94; India Stock, 219 to 221; Exchequer-bonds, 98T to 99; and Indiabonds and Exchequer-bills, 2s. dNcount to 2s. pm.
Foreign securities opened with steadiness, but there was less firmlness towards the close. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 9, and 94; for money, and 94, and 95 for the account. In the Four per Cents., guaranteed, the transactions were at 1In for the account. The business in other descrtptIsons comprised,-Brazilian New, for account, 1012; Buenos pyres, 83f; Chilian Six per Cents., 104; Ecuador New Consolidated, 14r; Guatemala, 60; Mexican Three per Cents., 21X- Spanish New Deferred, 23i; the Certificates of Coupon not funded, 6; and Datch Two-and-a-f3alf per Cents., 64~ and 65.
n the corn-tmarket this morning a reduction of between is. and 2s. vas accepted, the supplies being of inferior quality.
The clopasg prices from the Paris Bourse this evening again failed to arrive.
The trade reports from the manufacturing towns for the past week contain nothing of importance. At Manchester transactions are stil conducted with hesitation, owing to the uncertainty as to the maintenance or probable increase of the rise in the Liverpool cotton-market. The Birmingham advices describe finness in the iron market, the American orders being larger than at the corresponding period of the past twao years. In the general occupations of the place there has been no alteration. At Nottingham a good demand has prevailed for hosiery, but in lace the operations have been unimportant, although the tone remains favourable. In the yoollen districts there has again been a full amount of business.
The commercial advices from New York this week describe great animation in the stock-market, and an average rise of 1 or 2 per cent, in the leading securities. This was attributable to the continued diminution of the specie shipments to Europe. Atthe latest date, hovever, the rate of exchange showed a slight increase of finmness, and throughoat the next two or three weeks there would be a demand for bills to remi' in payment of the half-
tearly dvidends on American stocms held on this side. Erie Railway was quoted 63, Yew York Central, 94a; Panama, 100 to i (or 94 toatex div.); Reading, 8t to i; Illinois Central, 124u to 125; and Illinois Central Bonds, 97j. In the general course of commercial affairs there had been nothing new.
A ccording to the private advices from Shanghasi, dated the 19th of November, received by the overland mail, there seemns a prospect that the spee.ie shipments to that port may prove to have been excessive, owing to the insufficiency of produce available for returns. The speculation in the London silk-market has lately been rarried to a point that renders it unsafe to place implicit reliance upon the opinion of any of the houses or of the correspondents of the houses that have been engaged in it; but, as far as a judgment can be formed from the letters of respectable firms on the present occasion, it would appear to have been believed at Shanghai that the extraordinary stimulus given to the export trade during the first three months of the season had drained the country of the bulk of the yield. It was thought, however, that prices had reached a maXomvm in Shanghai, as they now stood at a point equal to the highest quoted from England. Under these cireunstances the large arrivals of silver from this side wnere produing a marked effect, and the decline in exhange appears to have been greater than that mentioned on sriday. It was then said that it had gone from 7s. 5d. to s. is; but some transactions had takben plaee at 7s. 3d., and the subsequent quotation was 7s. 2d. No large amounts were offering, and the American houses were understood to regard 7s. as the fair rate. At Canton, whence the aceounts are to the 24th of November, the exchange stood at 4s. 7id. to 4s. 8d., being only a fraetion lower tman at the previous dates. Withregard to the prospeet of a ceontinued interruption of business, it iS mentioned that the English forees had lately been engaged chiefly in strengthening their preeautions against firerafts, &e., and that aecordig to some statemnents there was a disposition to remain as much as possible on the defensive until a reply to the first adviees of the war shal have been received from E:ngland; meanwhile reinforcements were understood to have been sent for from India. The chief hope of a speedy settlement was therefore confined to the possibility of orders being transmnitted from the Imperial Government at Pekin for Governor Yeh to aeeedo to the demancls made npon him. As that fnetionary, however, had deelared in his proclamfation that the English had joined the rebels, it was thought he mi,0ht havxecoveoyed the sameo imprssion to the Emperor, in which case it was possible he would receive no instructions, other than that he should continue his proeeedinrgs for our extermination.
At a hal-eyearly meeting of the IJnion Bank of Australia, held tday, Mr. J. J. Cummins in the chair, a dividend at the rate of 20 per cent, per annum, free of income-tax, was declated, and the report and accounts weere unanimously adopted. It eas stated that the establishment is in a satifsoe tory position, and that the accounts from the colony are of a favourable nature. OwTing to an improvement in the value of some of the estates the total reserve held against doubtful dependencies is about 54,0001., in addition to a sum of 8,0001. or 10,0(i01. expected to be realized from property in Melhorne. In answer to a question, it was announeed that this reserve is regarded as meore than sufficient to cover the whole of the debts alluded to. Subroined art e creport and aeeounts:-
aThe advices received from the colonies since the annual meetingtin July ast reach dop n to the 16th of October. 3Mr. hlDonald, vwho had then recently returned to Sydne; fronl a tour of inspection, reports in the most satisfactory terms relative to the general interests and business of the bank at all its branches. The exchanges, especially at lelbourne, have not oeen as productive of profit as durinta previous years. increased competition has kept the rouoh gold produced at a price on vvhich scarcely any profit coulid ~ercalized Oll its importation to this country. This bank has carefully abstained from sany measure calculated to encourage this comsetition* and the directors have every reason to be convinced that their managers at the branches contiguous to the gold.producing districts have zealously and ptudently carried out the viewvs of the beard in their cautious policy, without omitting any opportunity of obtaining the needful supplies of the precious metal on termsa not less favourable than the other establishments.
"T1here can be no doubt that the Australian colonies are steadily advancing in every element of w ealth and national importance. The progress of railroads and other internal improvements promises the still further development of their_vast resources,
' l.e statement of accounts presents an amount of net profit, for the six moniths now reported on, of 90,5281., fromi which 7,0571. lhas, been deducted for income-tax paid, leaving 83,4701. for division, This admits of 82,0001. being appropriated for the purpose of dividend, which the directors have determined to apply as interest on the paid-up capital; and the saiie ill ernish a dividend, by way of interest, at the rate of 10 per cent. for the half-year,

rised five vessels, three to Port Phillip and two to s3ydney, with an aggregate capacity of 3,821 tons. 'l'he rates of freig,ht exhibit a tendencyto heaviness.

THE WRECK OF THE TYNE.-The loss of the Tyne
THE WR1ECK OF TIr TYNE.-The loss of the Tyne is calculated to shalke all confidence in seamanship and navigation. Every oAre, every precaution seems to have been taken. Soundings were frequently had. The captain was himself on deck attending to the ship's course Her sition was known w mith precson. Her course t the tse of Wight, distant only 20 leaOues, lay clear of danger. At midnight. they had mado Portland Lights bearing N.E. The ship must then bave been well to the south of West tay, and outside the Race of Portland. At a, little after 2 p.m. she was to the S.S.E. of the lightsh diant about three leagues. Sh e was then clear of the Shambles, and had a fair course E. by N, for the Needles. Yet she niust have steered N.E or N.E. by N. to run ashore where shedid totbewe th ofSt.Alban Head. Sappy itwasthat her error was not somewhat Ile by a point ortwo, for I she had gone ashore east of St. Alban's, between it and thoDfluri
ston or Peverel Point, she would have broken up, strong as she may be, and probably not a soul would have escaped. The liffs ace along that grim iron-bound coast almost precipitous, in some places overhan g the sea, It was at Peverel Point that the alsekwell East Indiamau was lost many years ago. The ship lay broadside on ins a cavern under the cliff, and the few who were saved were dragged up by ropes. Several perished in this operationw being dashed by the force of the wind against the face of the Sliff. As for the fatal error in the can oue f the Tyne, it can only be aeounted for by an error in the compass, carelessness in the steering, or a strong inset of the tide. Blame east upon the poor dumb compasses which cannot take their own past, we confess we always suspect. Carelessness in steering would seem inconsistet with the conduct of the ship in every other respect, and we cannot suppose that the "hconning" was neglected. An inset of the tiae strong enough to set the sbip so far north we do not belive to exist between Portland and St. Alban's. The set is rather the other way on the flood, the race then running south. east; but what the tide was -when the di-ster occurred is not stated. Further up in Christ Church Bay there is a strong inset, but that is 30 mniles off. We trust the official inqur will clear up this mvstery. Meanwhile St. Alban's is handsomely abused for being in the way, and so headstrong. There are few heads on the coast so wellconditioned. Ho is steep too, and good-sized vesuels can pass close enough to throwv a biscuit ashore between himn and his turbulent race alMost as bad as Portland. But it has often struck us that a lighi. would not be amiss, to guide ships hound sup that had not happened to sight Portland. We are aware of the sound objections to over-
lighting a coast, hut there is no light between Portland and Ithge Needles, and there is no danger that a light on St. Alban's wouild be rmistaken for any other in the neighbour. hood. Itolheight would distinguish it from Portland lights, which stand low, and the absence of the HuLrst Castle lights would make a imistake between it and the Needles iijpos. sible. It might he mistaken for St. Catherina's by shiips from the French coast and ignorant of their position, but the course which this error would prescribe would be with. out danger. To ships bound down a light on St. Alban's would be a help as directing them to shape their course for cleari-ng both the Shamibles and Portland.-Examijner..

The Bishop Auckland branch of this company's railway was examined last week bv the Government Inspector, and, although a large traffic in coals and coke has beenu carried over the line for some time, it was thought advisable to allow the embankments a short time longer to consolidate before opening the railway for passenger traffic. It appears that the bridges and other works have been well constructed and the signals satisfactorily arranged.
WILTS, SOMERSET, AND WEYMOUTIL
The section of this line from Dorchester to Weymouth opens to-day for passenger traffic. Arrangements have been made for conveying passengers from the Waterloo-bridge station to Wlemouth, and vzc rersQ. Five trains each way are to run daiy between London and Weymouth.

MARK-LAKE. XONA.YATfR'nU, Ti~ -lo
The arr1vals last week were moderate. The exports were 5,675 quarters wheat, 1,635 quarters barley, 40 quarters vats, 1,173 quarters maize, and 590 seks flour.
Of horne-grown wheat the receipts were 6,038 quarters, of foreign, 12,749 quarters, hIlf being from the East Indies For the morning's supply there was only a moderate show from the near counties, generally deteriorated by the damp weather, though some fine samples were exhibited; even these were neglected by millers, and such low rates offered that factors preferred holding over, while for the inferior parcels an abatement of 2s. per quarter would have been gladly conceded. Scarcely any business was transacted at a late hour. To sell foreign lesa money had to be taken, but generally there was no pressure in sales.
Of flour the quantity from the country was 15,898 sacks, with 184 sacks and 4,607 barrelsfrom abroad. Norfolk was Is. lower with a dull trade, and American only nominaUy mnaintained former rates. Town -made was unaltered.
Of English barley there were 6,523 quarters; of foreign 12,2.31 quarters. Though the scarcity of fine maltinu
smples maintained prices, the secondary descriptions were fuly Is cheaper, with a slow sale.
The supply of foreign oats was 17,752 quarters, with 2,123 quarters English, 3,052 quarters Sootch, and 2,512 quarters from Ireland. Trade was languid, and prices occasionally in favour of buyers, excepting fine qualities.
The quantity of English beaus was 1,131 quarters, the foreign, 1,316 quarters. The total supply of peas was only 766quarters, of which 385 quarters were from abroad. Neither of these pulse underwent any change of value, but both feund a slow market.
With 1,880 quarters of linseed from India the market was again Is. per quarter dearer, cakes fully maintaining their previou3 prices.
There is now improvement in the demand for cloverseed, but buyers act cautiously, and the trade is yet far from active. Where business has been done in red seed values have been fully maintained, choice samples selling at fulU rates. The supply of English is seanty, and it would appear no quantity can be exported. White seed and trefoils are fully as dear.

GL,SGow, Jan. 17.-Cotton.-We have had a very languid cotton-market throughout the week, witth rather easier prices. It closes more firmly with a better tone. Goods and Yarns.-The tone of the market for goods and yarns is better, and there is a confident feeling that present prices will be maintained, particularly as stocks continue remarkably li;ht. Iron.-In teo early part of this week the market for pig-iron was flat, pretty strong efforts being made to depress, under which the price o inixed numbers fell to 78s. cash. About Wednesday, however, a reaction set in, caused principally by the re orta of grow; inS disconteut among tho miners and col iers, who a
agitating for advance of wages ana should the masters not think proper to yield to their demandis a trike may ensue. The market has recovered 1s. per ton, mixed Nos. being done yesterday at 74s. 3d. prompt cash. To-day, however, with a thin attendance, price tended downward, and I think 74s%. cash would not have been refused. No. 1L

A Gallant Deed.
A GALLANT.DBED. ..
The steamer LIPlata, whioh left SoUthampton for $,ho West Indies on Wednesday, the 3d of Deeumber, encoumtered bad weather for nearly a week, and vey heavy gales from the south-west, of unusuaUy log duration. Daring that time her jibboom, her jib, and foretopmast ataysail were carried away; her eutwater satained serious inju, and her paddle-boxes were injured..On Frday, the 5th of December at noon, when in the latitude of the Bay of Biscay, during a heavy gale from the south'west, and the sea running very high, two sailors were washed off the bowsprit. Mr. Edward William May,'a young superntmerary offlcer on board the Plta, reported to the captain, IIMBau overboard!l" and, instantly unfastening a circular life-buoy, junmped overboardl, int his heavy rough-weather dress,I from a considerable height above the water. He had seen one of the men floating past, and when in the water he received aniother life-buoy which some one had thrown over, and swam to and seoured it; he then swa6m in -the direction in which he had seen the drownLing man, frequently lost sight of hir owing to the height of the sea, but eventnaUy succeeded in reaching hun. He found this man perfectly insensible, but just floating with his hesd under water, and managed to put one of the buoys over his head and arm. Ho was then trying with difficulty to grt the other buoy over his own head (which hitherto he held only under his arm), when a heavy sea took it and washed it over his head and chest without his further effort. He could see nothing of the other man, nor was he ever seen by any one after being washed off. His name was Watts, about 18 years of age
AU were much indebte to the seamanship of CAptain Weller during the long gale, and his coolness and skiU on this trying occasion. Be gave orders to man the first cutter on tearing from Mr. May, " Man overboard l" not without feeling much doubt whether the lives of so man
should be placed in such risk. It was the opinion of I present-aud some among the passengers had been captains of ships, who were entitled to bo competent jndges -that the lowering, managing, and hauliignup of tho boat were effected with consummate skill and courage by the chief officer, another officer, tho boatswain, and four seamen, who composed the crew of the cutter, under the direction of Captin Weller, it being thought by many that it was har%ty possible the boat could live and return on board.
By the mercy of Providence the boaVts creow suceede in finding Mr. May and the seaman, and in getting them on board of it, and, after regaining the ship and once again drifting astern of her, the boat was vith great risk sueceesful ald up.
fa en it is considered the knowledge a sailor must have possessed of the little chance there was that a boat could be successfully launched and reach him under thecircumstance3 of a furious sea, running high, raised by gales of some days' duration, the act of M May is above the ordinary level of praise or comment, Thoelo ro Ant 12 passengqrs on boara, vho expressed their admiration of his deed of courageous self-devotion by presenting him a French and an English address, and a sextant with the inscription,
Presented to Mr. Edward William May by the passengers on board the E. IIX S. La Plats, aus a, testimonial of their high admiration of his galant conduct in jamping overboard and providentially saving thelife of a seaman dunmg a heavy gale in the Atlantic on the 5th of December, 1850."
The offloei.-s of his ship have, we believe, presented him wvith a telescope.
We mnust a relate that in St. Thomas harbour, en Saturday Dec. 20, a man fell overboard between the Plita and the &onway steamers. Mr. Dix and Mr. May, officers who were both on that day transferred to the Conway from the Plats, immediately jumped overboard and rescued the man, who was unable to swim, they, happily, escaping aL attacks from sharks with which the harbour at the inlad of St. Thomas abounds.
Dr. Cumming On Popular School Books
DIL CUMMfNArN oy POPULAR SCHOOL 2OOKS
TO TE{1 EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Permit me to reply, as briefly as possible, to Dr. Cmuming's attack on the recent editions of Ince'8 Outincs of Rngliah History.
To the vRious editions of this book has been appended the following notice:-
"It is respectfully requested that any suggestions for tho improvement of this or other volumes of the series of 'Ou2tines' be addressed to the publisher, 49, Faternost6rrow.",
This has brought a great extent of correspondence from a mnltitude of persons engaged in the profession of education, as well as from clergymen of almost every denomination, and literary characters of eminence. These communications have been from time to time taken into consideration, and, if approved, after conslting the best anthories, adopted; but I can truly say that I don't think a single letter or suggestion has come from a Roman Catholic source, neither am I conscious of having written a line with this tendency, unless the devoted study of truth, the constant reference to authorities, in the great majority of cases Protestant, the anxious desire to make the book what has always been my perpetual aim, worthy of its continued approval and increased success, has led mne in the opinion of Dr. Cumming to do so. The Doctor, too, is exceedingly unfortunate in his quotations from what he states to be the originals of Mr. Ince, as a great portion even of them emanated from my own pen, as well as some of the others; besides which, Mr. Ince's brief and unsatisfactory reference to Luther occ'upied only two lines; at the suggestions of others, it was extended by me tiU it became, what it is now, 24 lines.
As to the announcement on the cover, I had a short time since a communication from the Lords of the Council on Education drawing my attention to it, in consequence of which I adopted the foliowing in lieu of it:-
"It Is a gratifying fact to add that this is the only book appointed by the Educational Branch of the Society of Arts (his Royal Highuess Prince Albert, p resident), as tests for their examinations of the prize students on the subject of English history. It is also, as well as the Oudincs of tGedgraplnj on the 'List of WVorks for use in Elementary Schools' of Hter Majesty's Committee of Council on Education,"
with a view to meet their Lordships' wishes, at the same time the objections which had been advanced, and I hare reason to believe the Doctor was aware of this recent altera. tion.
KNow, if Dr. Cumming and those who are acting in consort with him really wish to make this book as perfect and truthfual as anything human can be, why not adopt the suggestion of the notice quoted above, and if they found any difficalty in getting their communications attended to, then, in my judgment, would be the time for them to attempt to slaughter a book containing nearly a million of facts, and which I believe in my conscience to be the best manual of English history existing among us. I in confidence claim the protection of public opinion and posterity to justify me in asserting that a work which has been continuously recognized with unmixed approval by the press throughout the length and breadth of the land, and in praise of which r have received nearly a thousand letters of the highest practical appreciation and power, will, I trust, justify me in stating that its merits must be formidable; and, in conclusion, I assert my willingness, without re serve, to listen to continued suggestions for its improvc: ment.
It may be as well to state that in 1855 it was discovered that the various additions from time to time had imperceptibly led to some incongruities and errors; this caused me to decide upon putting the entire work into the hands of a competent literary friend for careful examination and correction; this was the specific edition subsequently submitted to the Lords of the Council on Education, and camno before the Society of Arts,
I remain, Sir, your obedient scrvant,
JAMES GILBERT.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THB EDITOB OF THE TIMBS.
Sir,-Allow me to give a word of advice to each of the two controversialists who have rushed forward in your columns as the champions of their respective churches-Mr. Bowyer and Mr. Cox.
1. Mr. Bowyer is eager to disclaim, on the part of the Roman Catholic Church, the application of the phrasa *'Dea" to the Virgin Mary, as "a blasphemous aud idolatrous beresy." Has he ever read the words which form the heading of one of the most celebrated chapters in Mr Newman's Essay on Development,-" Deification of S. Mary T.,
2. Mir. Cox is equaUy eager to disclaim, on thepartof the Church of England, or, as he expresses it, "of all Catholics,', the application of the term " Mlother of God" to the Virgin Mary, as a " blasphemous and idolatrous heresy." Eas he ever read tho second of the Thirty-nine Articles, or has he ever heard of the General Council of Ephesus, which adopted this very expression,-"Theotokos," "Deipara,' '"Mother of God," as the test of the Catholic faith !
A little more knowledge and a little less confidence would not be unbecoming in tho two combatants, and would, per haps, tend to a larger amount of Christian truth and Chris tian charity.
I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,
A eWOTESTANT PRESBYTER.

LONDON, TUESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1857.
Were anything wanted to prove the infatuation of crime, it would be supplied in the fact of a highly-educated murderer spending months and even years in contriving the apotheosis of his victim. Whether for the pageantry of time or the glories of eternity, whether with a regard to the pen of the historian or a more awful record, there are few men with the smallest elevation of soul who would not count the death of the Archbishop of P&AIs as something happy and desirable. In the popular estimate it is worth many years of splendour, power, and enjoyment; and that popular estimate colours the daydreams of the wisest, the greatest, and the best. In the mind of France, not only at this day, but for ages to come, M. SiBoul stands out from the list and crowd of prelates as a martyr who perished nobly in a sacred place, in sacred vestments, and in the very act of blessing his people. For at least a twelvemonth the murderer had fed his imagination with the picture of his Primate and his benefactor bleeding at the altar, and for months he had carried about the instrument of murder. The wretched man was a believer, and there appears not the least reason to suppose that he excused the crime even to his own mind on the ground of the particular dogma against which he had protested. His quarrel withl the Archbishop was a personal one, and for that personal quarrel he deliberately planned and perpetrated a vengeance which ten thousand legends, pictures, examples, and homilies might have assured him would be the beatification of its object. Our great dramatist has made HAmLET, in the dim twilight of his frenzy, grudge a doomed miscreant even that redeeming chance and shadowy grace he might have by dying in a moment of compunction. VERGER could have no doubt whatever as to the high qualities of the Archbishop, and as little could he doubt the justice and necessity of his own exclusion and punishment. He had received personal relief and excessive indulgence from the prelate; yet he spent a year in elaborating the scene in which he was himself to figure to the end of time as a brutal, ungrateful, sacrilegious assassin, and the Archbishop as a dutiful, honourable, meek, and generous martyr. By that eye of faith which was not wholly blinded he saw more than this. He saw, and must, day after day for a whole twelvemonth, have realized a horrible futurity. But even in what he foresaw in this world of sense there was enough to turn the balance infinitely in favour of his victim's fate as compared with his own. Yet, reckless passion and disappointed pride could concentrate his whole soul, as it were, in the point of the dagger, and see nothing, feel nothing, care for nothing, in time or eternity, but just that one half instant in which the sbarp blade would pierce through stole, and surplice, and cope, and soutane, deep into the heart that felt for him but would not fear.
Yet so mixed is the quality of all human greatness, and such the infirmity of all human goodness, that even this pure, unsought martyrdom, has its disparagements. The vanity, ambition, and obstinacy of the murderer had been fed up t) this pass of atrocity by a series of unaccountable and unjustifiable indulgences on the part of his ecclesiastical superiors. At the age of 18 he had been formally dismissed from the ecclesiastical seminary where he had been four years, and where consequently his character was well known, for embezzling money. After a probation at a private school he was admitted, notwithstanding his known dishonesty, to the larger seminary of Meaux, was ordtained, and served several parishes in that diocess. Here lie soon displayed vanity, restlessness, and ambition, faults not very uncommon in all communions and classes, but which in this instance ought to have called attention to the darker points of his character. He soon left that diocess, and came to seek his fortune in Paris, where he obtained temporary employment. The same recommendation, that is, we suppose, the same foolish old Lady Superior at Neuily who had first put him to school, notwithstanding her full knowledge of his "improbity," and no doubt a good deal more, induced the parish priest of St. Germain rAuxerrois to attach him as supernumerary to that very important churcb. The man spent three years here, was helped out cf debt, and received other kindnersses ; but, not getting on as he wished, turned against his benefactor, and began that series of persecutions !aud annoyances which led to his last crime. He was " deprived," and one would think that he had now had grace enough, and that the authorities of the Galiean Church had nothing to do but write his name in the black books, and warn one another ag3inst hiin, VEuum, however, calculated on
their weakness, and carried-his point. By dint of complaints, odious calumnies, incessant menaees of scandal, and impudent demands, he prevailed at last on the Archbishop, not to give him a further trial in his own parish or diocess, under his own eye, but to intercede with the Bishop of MEAUX, still his ecclesiastical superior. Vmaoai was admitted to regular employment under that Bishop, expressly out of consideration for the Archbishop of PAIUs. This was only last February, and before the year was over the Bishop of MEAUX had to pronounce a sentence of " interdic"tion" on the manwhom,inspite of the most flagraut unfitness, he had admitted to a responsible position in his diocess. At the very time that he (the Bishop of MEAUX) consented to receive him again, out of consideration for M. Sirovn, he had purchased an axe for the slaughter of that prelate, made arrangements, and written a memorandum stating that it was his own act. So notoriously was he capable of any atrocity, that vhen he came up to Paris finally, on the sentence of interdiction, and took his measures for the assassination, he felt it necessary to avoid the sight of his fellowstudents in the Church of St. Etienne-du-Mont, as they would suspect his purpose, and give warning of him. Such was the man, so disgraeed, so notorious, so turbulent, so thoroughly " iU-con" ditioned," so uniformly misconducted from the beginning of his career to the end, whom the Archbishop of PARIs had asked the Bishop of
IsAux, as a favour, to recall and employ in the sacred office of the cure of souls.
The kind and gentle character of the Archbishop happily encourages us to take the most lenient view of the fault, since fault it must be considered, for which he has made so terrible an atonement. No doubt, he hoped against hope, and was more moved by the misery and degradation of the unhappy priest than by the consideration of the souls that might fall under his spiritual charge. He saw the one, and did not see the other. The one was before him for months, obtrusive, importunate, exigent, troublesome, incessant, bringing scandal on the church at his very doors, yet promising amendment, and, at all events, poor and miserable; with the light of the awful event, we may now pronounce that the Archbishop ought, at any risk, and without regard to persons, to have cleared his church and himself of so bad and so dangerous a man. Instead of this, he merely swept away the nuisance from his own door and threw it on his neighbour's. Fortunately for his fame, at last he did his duty, and refused to remove the interdiction, which no doubt had been laid on VEPaEsi with his full concurrence. He thus died a martyr to discipline. He did not display, however, this most indispensable virtue of high office till he had shown a want of it. It was the vice of the age into which he feU so long, happily to rise at last superior to it. In all cnurches, in all countries, in all public departnents, it is the man, the officer, the functionary, the public servant who is considered, and not the vast interests and the immense responsibility in his keeping. The fund of indulgence seems to be inexhaustible, but it is at the expense of the people. It is at the risk of their temporal, or, as in this case, their eternal interests. We may be as humane with offenders and unworthy people as we please, but let it be at our private and particular cost, not by sacrificing the interests of the many to the convenience of a few. The Archbishop of PAIis committed a grievous error in deliberately letting loose a church wolf on the diocess of Meaux; he nobly atoned for it by perishing in the attempt to rid his church of the nuisance.
The condition and progress of the American
The condition and progress of the American Navy form a subject replete with interest to the people of this country. It is very true that in one respect we may be considered rather as teachers than learners in this matter, but if the Americans represent a far younger State than ourselves, and if their policy up to the present time has not aimed so directly at the establishment of a powerful navy, they have always bestowed extraordinary pains on the construction and equipment of individual vessels. Comparatively speaking, they have few ships, but their desire has always been to make every ship a model of its kind for efficiency and strength. They are entitled, in fact, to the credit of having carried ships of every rate to the utmost limits of their respective capacities-of having made frigates equal to ships of the line, and corvettes equal to frigates. At this very moment, too, they are launching a new class of steamvessels, with batteries of prodigious power, so that in their marine, though much smaller than our own, we may look for the latest inventions in the science of naval architecture or the arts of destruction.
On the 1st of December last the Secretary of the American Navy made his annual report to the PRESIDENT of the United States on the state and prospects of that department, explaining in a lucid description the duties discharged by the several squadrons afloat, the actual condition of the serviee, and the changes or improvements which it was thought proper to recommend. From this document we collect much valuable intelligence, but its most striking feature, perhaps, is contained in the general view which it (xhibits when regarded as a whole. As if under the influence of some irresistible law of things, the Americans are steadilytreading in our own footsteps, and advancing graduaUy to the formation of a larger regular marine. * The keynote of the report in almost every section is "exten" sion." The traditional policy of throwing the utmost skill and pains into the construction of single ships is not forgotten, but by the side of this principle appears that of expanding the whole naval force. Hitherto there has been only one American squadron in the Pacific, -it is now recommended that there should be twvo. MIeasures are suggested for insuring the supply of seamen, and American seamen especially, for the national service; additional officers are spoken of, and the forests on the western coasts of the continent are to be searched for ship timber. The spirit in which these and other recommendations are made is explained in one of the paragraphs of the report so clearly as to leave no room for misconception. "'The arguments and
considerations," says the Secretary, "for a C steady and gradual enlargement of our niary have "lost none of their force. Our extended coast,
our multiplied commerce, the maintenance of ou*r r rank among the great Powers of the earth, all speak loudly in favour of this policy." We believe the impulse here indicated to be both natural and inevitable in the growth of a great nation, rnd sincerely do we rejoice over the reflection that the power to be thus developed must necessarily, by the laws of political gravitation, be carried to the side of liberty and progress.
The latest novelty in the American service consists in the introduction of guns of a peculiar form, intended to throw shells of enormous weight. The e.xplanations of the Secretary on this point are extremely interesting. As long ago as 1850 the cannon of the new model were spoken of as yielding the maxiimum of power to be obtained out of a given weight of metal, and during the years 1852, 1853, and 1854 the invention was subjected to rigorous and unremitting tests. At length, when the construction of six frigates had been ordered by Congress, it was resolved to fit them witl this new species of armament, and one
specimen, the Merrimac, has visited our shores. As the guns are very heavy, the number composing the battery will not be great, but some idea may be formed of their power when we say that the largest of the three calibres specified will carry a projectile of 1351b. weight, or, in other words, will throw more metal than four 32pounders. These projectiles are to take the form of shells, as being the more destructive, but it is expressly stated that solid shot could be used in case of attack upon the stone walls of fortifications, 5although," adds the Secretary, " recent de5velopments in the late European wvars will "hardly encourage such assaults to be often under5taken." Steam power in these vessels is only employed as an auxiliary, it being reserved as an indispensable condition that their capacities as sailing vessels should be kept unimpaired, but a greater rate of speed than usual has nevertheless been obtained. The two leading principles of the new models appear to be-first, the distribution of a great weight of metal-equal to that of a heavy 40-gun frigate-among 10 or 12 guns only; and next, the preservation of the most valuable qualities of a sailing vessel, in conjunction with a considerable power of steam for occasions requiring it. Altogether, it is remarked in the report, that " the introduction of these "magnificent vessels constitutes an era in the
"history of the United States' Navy."
It is rather curious to observe, that while the Americans are thus taking a stride ahead of all other nations in the composition of their armaments, they are acknowledging imperfections in the study of gunnery, for the Secretary alludes to the Portsmouth gunnery-ship-the Excellent-as a feature of our service deserving imitation in theis, remarking, at the same time, that hitherto they have relied for their training upon practice at sea. His views of this subject are full of interest. He observes that, generally speaking, an American finds himself instinctively at home with firearms. It is much the same, indeed, among ourselves, and the wilder features of Transatlantic life, involving in so many instances a resort to the gun as an indispensable instrument, would of course give a stimulus to the national partialities. "Americans," says the report, "are "adepts in the use of the rifle and the musket "from their boyhood, and when thrown into the "field, no matter how suddenly, they are skilful, "and their aim is as fatal as that of the trained " soldier." This is simply an incident of that individuality of character which renders an American so much of a man and so little of a machine; but the Secretary adds, with evident reason, that " the " case is very different with regard to the manageCC ment of cannon weighing thousands of pounds " upon a disturbed sea." As an improvement, therefore, upon the system in use, he recommends that special consideration and encouragement should be extended to an attempt already made, in the absence of legislation on the gubject, towards the establishment of a gunnery practice ship, and expresses his own opinion that " a vast improvement would follow if no man-of" war went to sea without an officer designated " especially as the ordnance offeer of the ship."
Such are the principal features of the report before us, denoting a renewed advance in the traditional paths of the American Navy, and at the same time an extension of the national policy in the creation of an enlarged marine. That such a movement was unavoidablewe are entirely persuaded. No great and rising nation could possibly abdicate its functions as a member of the mighty Commonwealth of States. It is of the very essence of civilization that States as well as men should be brought into multiplied relations with each otber, and these relations necessarily presume the maintenance of such an attitude as shall secure respect. Nonintervention, in its general and comprehensive sense, is as impossible a theory in matters of international as it would be in those of domestic police. Offences vill come, and offenders niust be restrained. A breach of public law or peril to the public peace concerns one member of the community as well as another, and imposes upon aU alike the duty of contributing to order and of upholding in efficiency those means by which order may be preserved. Within the last few years we have seen these expedients unhappily fail and the long repose of Europe rudely interrupted, but the strife, though sanguinary, was comparatively short; and it cannot be denied that under the present system of international relationship more than one cloud has been dispersed which in former times would have produced a hurricane of war.
Had the case of "The QUEEN V. MARIA CLARKE
Had the case of " The QuLT-, v. MAIAi CLARiE "(In Re ALICIA RACE)," which was tried on Saturday at the Queen's Bench, been what is called a jury case, we should have abstained from aU comment upon it until the delivery of judgment. This, however, is not so. Tlhe facts of the case are told in half-a-dozen brief sentences, but the decision upon the legal argument which was raised upon them rests with Lord CAMTPBELL and Justices WiGIrTw- and CROSIPToN. Now we presnme that even the advocates of the Roman party will scarcely venture to assert that any statement or comment which we offer upon the case wll warp the minds of the learned personages whom we have just named, or influence their judgment. WVe do not take up the legal balances and affect to determine nice distinctions between the rights of the " testamentary guar"dian" and the "guardian of nurture," and other such recondite matters. It is the business of the Judges to decide such points, and no doubt they will do so in accordance with the doctrines of English law. Our only object is to spare the patience of our readers, not many of whom wil have been at the pains of wading through four portentous columns of legal report in order to ascertain the subject of Saturday's argument in the Queen's Bench. Here is the story :-There was a certain Sergeant of Marines, named LAUIMAN RACE, who seems to havebeen a very fine fellow, who was killed underfire atPetropaulovski, in September, 1854. He belonged to the Pique. _'Now, this sergeant was married, and he had by his wife two children, a boy and a girl. The boy, JOHN, is now about 12 years old; the girl, ALICIA, is about 10. The mother's name is ALCIA RAcE, and she still survives, a widow. Sergeant RACE, on the 24th of August, 1854, made a will, which concluded with these words:-
" I do hereby nominate, constitute, and appoint my wife, Alicia Race, executrix of this my will and testament, feeling confident that she wiU do justice to my dear children as a wife and a motber."
The mother is a Roman Catholic, the father was a Protestant. " The father (said Mr. O'MALLEY)
" Always brought up his children as Protestants, and sent them to Protestant schools. Ho himself always attended the services of the Church of England . . . It was found, also, that for eight months after their father's death the children attended a Protestant school and Protestant worship, and the mother went with them."
We quote the very words of the counsel employed lest we be charged with inaccuracy of any kind. The elder obild, the boy JomN RACE, after his father's death was sent to the Sailors Orphan Boys School and Home at Chardstock, in Dorsetthire, which is supported from the Patriotic Fund. In July, 1855, the little girl AiciA was also sent to the Sailors Orphan Girls School and Home at Hampstead, whichis maintained in thesame manner. Things appear to have gone on reasonably we)l for a time, but at length the Romanists got hold of the mother and persuaded her to remove her son
from Chardstock. This done, they informed her that they could do nothing for the boy until the girl too was taken &way from the Pro. testant school at Hampstead. Hereupon Mrs. RACE endeavoured to regain possession of the child, but the girl strongly resisted all endeavours to remove her, and expressed her determination to remain at Hampstead and her 'wish to be brought up in the tenets of Protestantism. upon this due application was made, and there was issued a writ of habeas corpus, directed to the matron of the Sailors Orphan Girls School and Home at aIampstead, and requiring her to produce ALICIA RAcE in the Queen's Bench on Saturday last, which was accordingly done. The effort on one side, of course, was to reinstate the mother in possession of the child; on the other, that the child should be at liberty to choose for herself.
Now, as we before said, it is not our province to determine nice questions of testamentary guardianship, or guardianship of nurture, but certainly, in the eye of common sense, nothing would appear more unreasonable than to compel this child to adopt against her will that religion which was not the religion of her father. The way in which the vwidow herself interpreted the will of her late husband may very ready be gathered from the facts, that she herself conducted the children, for eight months after the intelligence of his death had been received in England, to a Protestant church, and that she placed them in Protestant schools. Were this case reversed, and had Sergeant RAcE been a Romanist, and had his Protestant widow endeavoured to remove her young daughter from a Roman convent in order to bring herupas a Protestant, wecannot but think we should have heard an outcry about " proselytism in its " most hideous form," and other amenities of the like kind. The father was a Protestant, he brought his children up Protestants, they were taken to Protestant places of worship during his life and after his death ; after his death, too, they were placed in Protestant institutions, and now the mother seeks to take back this little Protestant girl in order to turn her into a Romanist. What would Sergeant RACE have done had he been alive 7 That is the point. No violence is used towards the child; the doors of the Orphan School at Hampstead are open to her if she chooses to rejoin her mother, but she anxiously desires to stay where she is. Under these circumstances, wil the Court of Queen's Bench do violence to the child, and actually tear her from the asylum in which she desires to stay, in open defiance of all that we can conceive to have been the wishes of her dead father? We cannot pretend to argue the question of law, but we trust that in this case the conclusions of lavr and of common sense may be found to coincide with each other.

It will cause isome surprise, and perhaps regret, tO learn that a large body of the established clergy -Of the diocess of Limerick have thought fit to address a remonstrance to the Lord-Lieutenant 'against the appointment of a distinguished professor of Oxford University (Mr. Hyde) to the insignificant post of master of the Limerick Diocesan School. In their memorial the reverend remonstrants pray that ;the appointment of an Englishman educated at 'Oxford shaU not be confirmed until the report of 'the Commissioners of Education shaU have been ,submitted to the Irish Government, and that in the -selection of a fit person to be placed at the head of -the school the claiams of the many scholars educated `at the Dublin University may not be passed over. Lord Carlisle's reply is as follows:-
" Viceregal-lodge, Jan. 13.
vSir,-I am directed by the Lord-Lieutenant to -acquaint you that he has received the address from several ,cler,l -en of the diocess of Limerick, requesting him to suspend the appointment of a master of the Diocesan School of
erick and Killaloe.
"His Excellency regrets that he cannot comply with this request, a vacancy having occurred, and a successor, of whose eminent qualifications and oompetency he had taken ,special pains to satisfy himsslf, having been already ap. .pointed.
His Excelency perceives, with regret, a recommendad*-Inade by the subscribers to the address, that he should limit his range of selection to one place of academical -education. His Excellency does not think it requisite to advert to precedents, -whichhe mnight cite in other Royal and Diocesan Schools; but while he fiuds it his pleasure as his duty to fill up the great bulk of the appointments which il1 to his disposal with natives of Ireland, and while he yields to no man in admiration of the successful system of education pursued at Trinity College, he yet knows that he should consider it an exhibition of great iUiberality if the * aduates of Trinity CoUege, Daubin, were to be excluded
rom holding appointments to schols and places of educa-tion in Englan , and he is not prepared to enforce a similar ,prohibition against the Un*versity of Oxford.
I have the honour to he, your very obedient servant.
"Rev. W. Newcombe Wilis.""4 FREE.D HOWvARD.
The selection of master is vested in the first inatnaxce in the Dean of Limerick (Dr. Kirwan, son -of the celebrated Dean of St. Patrick's), who, in the course of a manly and straightforward letter, thus explains ihe circumstances which led to the -appoiDtntent of Mr. Hyde .-
" It is said that, in searching for the most efficient master -who could be procured for the Diocesan School, the gra. -duates of Triiiity College, Dublin, hsd been passed over. I can assure the public that this assertion is not true; for -exactly the same course, and precisely the same pains were taken to discover eligible candidates in Trinity College, Dublin, as in any of the colleges of Oxford or Cambridge. The result, however, was that while there were many graduates of Dublin University, any -one of whom was fully Mr. Hyde's equal in learning and ability, not one of theni could be found who would accept of the vacancy, and of those who were desirous of obtaining it not one coola bear the :sightest comparison with MIr. Hyde in any of the re-qtsite qualifications for the office. The enlightened practice i the sister country is to open such places in their schoobs to the fair and honourable competition of candi-dates from all parts of the united kingdom, and I really -did not believe, until tread that memorial, that the opposite shortsighted and narrowminded policy was ever advocated by any man who was not a Repealer of the Uunion, and avery bigoted epealer. Three applications were made for the -appointment by masters of endowed schools in England, all 'of whom were Irishmen, educated at Trinity College, Uublia; and another instance I vill give, of whicx I am very proud,-my own two sons won by their musical talents a free eduaction in a 6rst-class collegiate school in England, where every boy not on the foundation pays 1001. a-year; may brave little fellows won it in a fair stand-up fight against 6 comlpetitors, all of whom vere the sons of English -clergymen and gentlemen. I wonder, wouIld they have had as good a chance had the petitioners been their judges "
LORD GOU(m.
It is stated that the veteran Lord Gough has pur-chased from the representatives of the late Mr. V. Knox the whole of the property bought by thern in -the Encumbered Estates Court from Lord Gort, which comprises most of the town of Gort and the land connecting it with the extensive demesne of Loughcooter.
ENCtNEDEED ESTATES COITRT.
The report is again rife that the pressure of 'business on the two Commissioners will necessitate -the appointment of a substitute for Baron Richards; and, according to the same indefihite authority, Mr. Woulfe Flanagan, the present Master of the -Court, is likely to be the third Commissioner. This gentleman's perfect knowledge of all the details of the Irish land tribunal? acquired during the time he filled the offices respectively of Secretary and Master, -certainly suggest the probability of his appointment to the commissionership. The sales last week realized 64,0001. For the first time Mr. Ormsby has added the acreage of the estates for sale, which apsVear in the case to which they are given to be 16,8GG acres to a rental of 8,0341., or hardly lOs. an acre.
THE GUANO TRADE.
The trade report of the Flreeman's -Journal some time since noticed an importation of 620 tons of .guano for Mr. Allan Pollok, and last week a still larger auantity was imported by this gentleman for -the cultivation of his large estates in the county -of Galway. A large vessel, the Enchanter, has .arrived, having on board 700 tons Peruvian guano from the Chincha Islands for Mr. Pollok. As the present value is upwards of 141. per ton, this cargo represents 10,0001. worth of manure for one singie farmer-a quantity, we should think, without any parallel. 'rhe advance in value in the last few weeks has been about 21. a-ton, about 1,5001. on this -one cargo.
FIRE AT THE BANK OF IRELAND.
At 5 o'clock this morning the city was thrown into a state of the greatest consternation by an announcement that the Bank of Ireland, one of the finest public buildings in Europe and formerly the -seat of the Irish Legislature, was in flames, and that from the rapid progress of the fire the most serious -Consequences were to be apprehended. The prompt -arrival of the engines, however, aided by the assist-ance of the police, soon checked the alarm, and the fire, after raging for about an hour, considerably abated, but the accountants' andbookkeepers' offices are, it is feared, completely destroyed. Fortunately -the morning is perfectly calni, there being scarcely a breath of wind blowing. Owing to the confusion and excitement, as well as to the difficulty of gaining access to the building, it is quite imposstble as yet to ascertain the precise amount of damage.
(BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.)
DUBLIN, MONDAY EVENING.
It appears that Miss Roberts, the housekeeper, did not retire to rest until 1 o'clock this morning, -and at that time all appeared safe. The night-watch had been for some time discontinued. The housekeeper's apartments are immediately opposite the Accountant -General's office, and at 4 o clock she was awakened by the glare of light issuing from the windows of the bookkeepers' departtnent. Miss Roberts forthwith gave the alarm, -when it was discovered that the flames were raging with great fury, but, prompt assistance having been speedily procured, the progress of the fire was fortunately arrested, and, although the bookkeepers' -offices are utterly devastated, no further miselcief has occurred to the building. The first person -aroused was MIr. Dabedat, the cashier, who resides in the bank. The first thing he did was to order the steamn-engine to work, and thus, shortly -after the arrival of the engines, an ample supply of -water was obtained. The tanks on the roof were found, when most wanted, to be dry, but the tanks on the ground floor were soon amply supplied, and thus the devastating power of the flames was soon got under. Eose had to be carried in the first instance to Fosterplace, whence a supply was procured until the tanks had been filled. How the fire originated is -a total mystery. Itvwas rumoured through town to-day that it occurred in consequence of an escape
-o gas, but such is not the fact. Yesterday beiAg -Sunday, access to any of the offices wasimpossible,and it appears almost incredible that the fire could have been smouldering since Saturday evening. Miss ,Roberts keeps the keys of all the offices, and she alleges, we understand, that no person had entered any of them since they were closed after business hours on Saturday. On the whole, the affair is .shrouded in mystery. The only property said to be -destroyed consists of useless blotters; aU the valu-
ahle books were locked up in the safes.

The Dean Of Westminster On The English Language.*
THE DEAN OF WESTMINSTER ON TR g
EBGLISH LANGUAGE.*
(Continued from ne Timej of Jan. 13.)
The reader who has had patience to folow us so far will be prepared in the case of the Anglo-Saxons and Normans for a repetition of the phenomenon which we have described as occurring in the case of the Saxons and Celts. Common report, ever prone to describe the slow work of centuries in a breath, eager to express results and impatient of the process which accounts for them, has asserted that when the Normans brought their language in the Saxon tongue died out, overwhelmed by a deluge of French words. This opinion was boldly advan^ed for centuries, and ignorance supported popular belief so long as Chaucer was the earliest authority which English philology loved to quote. It is only within the course of the last few years that the publication of a series of early EDglish works Ias enabled us to judge of the relative positions in which the Norman and Anglo-Saxon dialects stood to each other during the centuries which immediately succeeded the Conquest. The traveller who stands in auttunn on the river bank above Mayntz and watches the confluence of Rhine and Main, who sees the latter stream, swollen with rain, rushing through the red sandstone districts of Franconia in a ruddy flood, and who marks how the united rivers fiow for miles, the green waters of the Rhine on the left hand and the red current of the Main on the right-two rivals in one bed-will have before him an exact counterpart of the way in which the Norman and Anglo-Saxon nationalities in England existed side by side in England for nearly two centaries after the Conquest. The right, the upper, hand is usurped by the smaller but more impetuous tide of men which poured into England under William, and ran its bloodstained course apart from the old inhabitants. The left, the lower, hand is the lot of the larger but less energetic race, which, thrust on one side by its adversary, continues its course alone. So things remained for a century and a-half-that is to say, through the reigns of the Conqueror, of Wiliam Rufus, of Henry I., of Maude and Stephen, of the Second Henry, and of Richard Lionheart. So long did the red stream of Norman power pour unceasingly into England; so long were the Duchy and their large foreign fiefs paramount in the minds of the Kings of England; so long did the conquering race keep itself unmixed with its subjects in mnanners, customs, and language. But with the reign of John, at the beginning of the 13th century, the loss of the greater portion of their foreign possessions cut off the stream of Norman blood which had set so long into England; the alien race, deprived of the recruits who had kept up its numbers to a constant level, was left to struggle against the opposing nationality as it best coul ; the kings began to look at home, and no longer lived in Eugland with their thoughts in Normandy; now the rival streams begin to mix more and more in manners, customs, and language; the red lmie of division grows fainter and fainter-a little longer and the river is in very deed one mighty united stream, in which you cannot tell which is Anglo-Saxon or which is Norman, for all are English ; and thus, at last, but not till three centuries after the Conquest, we have an English nation and an English language.
Let us consider this a little more closely with regard to language. It must never be forgotten that languages, so long as they are living and not dead, are always in a state of change and progression. Changes of position to other races by conquest or emigration, mutual relations such as trade or alliance,-all changes, in fact, in the position of a nation itself will produce corresponding alterations in a greater or less degree in its speech ; but, besides all these accidental causes, there inheres in all languages an instinct of progression and simplification which in the course of centuries will inevitably produce mighty changes. It is invariably found that the language of a nation in early times shows a natural liveliness, and affects a fulness of inflexion and a variety of forms which in its mature age it is forced to abandon. In its youth it spells its words slowly and utters them gravely, in after life it scarcely spells them at all, and it clips them in pronunciation. It starts on its appointed course rejoicing like a giant in the weight it carries, it revels in its superfluous formns, in its dual nlmbers, its redundant tenses and moods, its multiplicity of inflexion and conjugation. This is in the cool morning of its existence ahen, conscious of its sarength, the whole day before it, it takes no heed of time; but as the day wears on it finds life more serious, it finds the race warm work, the weight begins to tell, it bends beneath its inflexions, its lengthy forms hamper and trip it up, it feels the want of expressions for abstract ideas, for philosophic and scientific terms, it has to make them for itself, or adopt them from other tongues. To make itself lighter itthrows away first one redundant form, then another; now this inflexion, or declension, or conjugation, now that, until it has thrown them all away as the pace increases and the rush down the racecourse of time grows hotter and hotter, and so at last it arrives at the destined goal, naked, but not out of breath; less bulky, but in better condition-a moder language, which in its way has cast off many things which it wore at the starting, but on the whole is much iniproved in wind and power of expre8sion.
This process of progression and simplification had been going on in the Anglo-Saxon language ever since the tribes which spoke it settled in Britain. At first the various forms of speech spoken by Saxons, Jutes, and Angles were merely so many kindred dialects in different parts of the island contending for the mastery. NVhen the various kingdoms of the Heptarchy merged into one kingdom of England, and the supreme power was consolidated in the hands of the Princes of the West Saxons, the dialect of that tribe became the language of the Court and country, wvhile its rivals remained in their old position as dialects. Of this West Saxon language we have sufficient remains left to see that between the times of Alfred and Edward the Confessor it had undergone considerable change from the internal law of progression which vwe have mentioned, and, in addition to this, the predilection of the Confessor-that thoroughly English King of whom we hear so much evil before and so much good after the Conquest-for Normans and Norman manners had brought, even before the invasion of William, many French words into the Anglo-Saxon language. That the Conquest itself exercised very small direct influence on the Anglo-Saxon may be proved from a comparison of the language used in Layamon's Brut, a semi-Saxon poem, containing more than 30,000 lines, written at the begiuning of the 13th century, with the language used in the time of King Edward the Confessor. In all Layamon's poem there are, we believe but 90 words of French extraction, and of these at Least 50 were in use before the Conquest. Forty words in a century and a half is not a very alarming French infusion, while the fact that an ecclesiastic could take the trouble to write a poem of this length in pure semi-Saxon, and in the old alliterative metre, is a pretty good proof that Saxoii, and not Norman, was the language
or the common people down to the reigis of E'ing John. An examination of the language of the Ormulum, a semi-Saxon paraphrase of a portion of the Bible of about the same date, and of the Ancren Riewle, or Rule of Anchorites, a little later, will furnish further proof of the same fact. Indirectly, indeed, by hurling the Anglo-Saxon down from high to low estate, by making Norman French the language of the Court, by introducing stricter hierarchical and ultramontane regulations into religion, the chief of which was the performance of the services of religion in Latin, and no longer as of old in the vernacular; by vulgarizing and degradig it, in fact, in every way, the Conquest exercised a great influence on the Anglo-Saxon, but directly it had very little. Until the time of King John and the loss of Normandy the two forms of speech continued to exist sulkily separate, though side by side, the one the language of the few, the other the dialect of the many; and, indeed, it is probable that during this period the Norman borrowed more from the Saxon than the Saxon from the Norman.
We have called the speech of England in the time of John semi-Saxon. Why not cal it AngloSaxon ? Because during that century and a half the internal law of simplification and proggression had

continued to exert its influence on the language at an increased ratio o' speed. This speed was ao doubt much increased by the Conquest, which by banishing the Saxon front Court to the huts of the peasant, by discontinuing it in laws and ordinances and relgious services and ceremonies, deprived it at once of its dignity and its standards of purity. In its vocabulary the languago of Layamon, as we have seen, was still pure Saxon, but in its form and construction it had changed materialy. Much that was Saxon had already been abandoned, without, however, any approach in these respects to the syntax of the conquering race. Thus many genders, inflexions, and terminations were abandoned; out of many cases, persons, and numbers which in the old Saxon were distinct, one or the other was picked out to do double duty, and thus to prepare the way ultimately for that complete simplicity, for that barrenness of gender, declension, and conjugation, which is one great characteristic of modern English. Still we maintain that this, though accidentally accelerated by the Conquest, was by no means caused by it. It was rather the result of the simpliting process mentioned before; and as a proof of this we need only turn to kindred dialects in countries which were never subjected to a conquering race, and where the language has developed itself free from interruption in this respect. Take the Swedish, or Danish, or Norwegian languages, spoken by people never conquered though often conquering, and we shall find that, though descended from the old Norse or Icelandic, a language at least as rich in forms, inflexions, and conjugations as the Anglo-Saxon, there is the same simplicity that we meet in moder English; with them, as with us, almost every vestige of gender, declension, aud conjugation has been thrown away. The case is the same, though in a less degree, with the German, which we may remark, about the 13th century, had a greater infusion of French words than our semi-Saxon of the same period, and, at the same time, nearly as great a confusion of forms. It, too, in its progress towards a modern language, has undergone many alterations and sustained many losses, but if we are to seek a reason why it has kept so many declensions, aud conjugations, and forms,' and genders, and inflexions, while all the nations around it have lost or modified their speech in these respects, we may, perhaps, account for it by pointing to the stagnant state in which Germany has always remained in a political point of view-an inert body without a heart, a mere congeries of States, content to balance each other, but without any principle of national progress. It is better for a nation to loseor modify its language than to retain it comparatively pure, and yet sink into political insignificance.
But while the Anglo-Saxon language was passing into semi-Saxon by undergoing this great internal change in its construction in common with other languages in Europe, and at the same time receiving a very slight admixture of words from the language of the conquering race, an event happened which at once produced an enormous change in it. This was the loss by King John of almost all the foreign possessions of his ancestors. Cut off from the continent, the monarchs felt themselves now, for the first time, Kings of England; the nobles, for the same reason, lived more among their English serfs; the King and his great vassals begani to quarrel, each in turn sought help among the English, and boasted of granting charters and protecting English towns; for it must never be forgotten that among the burghers in these towns English liberty was bred, and born, and cherished, until she grew strong enough to spread her wings over the " villains" of the rural districts; the rival nationalities now began to mix, the Anglo-Normain larnguage approximated and, as it were, gave pledges to the semi-Saxon, which stoutly retained its construction, though after a time it admitted the enemies' hostages to the rights of citizenship. In a little time the two forms of speech meet no longer as enemies, but friends; peace is proclaimed. Many more French words are treated, no longer as aliens, but as natives. The dialects cease to be called Anglo-Norman on one side, or semi-Saxon on the other. The common term Early English includes them both, and this Early Englsh, written or spoken with a greater or lessminglingof Freneliwords as the writer or speaker stood nearer or further from the Court, becomes the parent and progenitor of our modem English. This was the first great admixture of French into English, about two ceatuies after the Conquest; and so far was it from beinga direct consequence of that invasion that it was only, as we have seen, when the conquerors ceased to be regarded in that light, and began to be looked upon as English, that the sullen SaZons, sure of the ultimate predominance which awaited them, would consent to receive any but a ve y few of their masters' words into their own form of speech. Through the rei8ns of Henry Ill., of Edward I., and his degenerate son, the mutual relations of the two great elements which together formed the early Englishlanguage, remained pretty much the same, the eonstruction and formition of the language continued Saxon as before, and though it admitted French words and phrasei in a greater or less proportion at various times, it subjected them more and more to a lubricating process, which licked the foreigners into an English shape before it allowed them to pass current in Engliih mouths. With the glories of the third Edward, and the triumph of the English arms in France under his leadership and that of his valiant son-triumphs which to the Enlish at large were eminently national, and looked uDon as retributive for the Conquest three centuries before-are associated the rise of an English literature, and, oddly enough, a great influx of French words into the English vocabulary.
It is worth while to consider for a moment the influence which French literature has always exerted over our own. One of the results of the Conquest, and another wayinwhich it indirectly affected the English language, was the introduction of a new cycle of traditional fiction into the country. In Saxon times the songs in which the great deeds of the race were praised clustered round the heroes of the Niebelungeu tale. Sigurd and Brynhilda, Chri andilt aad Gunther, Gudrun and Atli, Hagen and V6lkermighty shadows of history, distorted by the flickering light of national tradition, which ffit across the stage in a never-ending procession, linked together by a common curse-the possession of ill-gotten gold-which drags them all down to destruction, after a struggle which reveals the tenderest and the sternest traits of human nature-woman's love for man, her strife and jealousy against woman; man's most constant love, his unshaken bravery, his noblest deeds, his truest friendship, and his foulest treachery,-all forming an epos which, for its combinations of joy and woe, has never been surpassed in the history of mankind. All this went out as a literature with the Conquest. It had probably been waning before the days of Norman rule, but its place, at any rate, had not been supplied by any other cycle. The Normans not only banished it from Court, and so debased it from its position as a literary standard, but brought somet ing in with tnem in its stead. Whatever may be the worth of Arthur Pendragon as an historical character, there is no mistake about his power and proportions as a hero of romance. Whatever he was,-whether he never existed at all as many, and not without justice, suppose,-whetier from some petty Welsh prince cursed with a frail wife and followers devoted as much to their mistress as to
tneir master, who sought relief from domestic sorrow by rushing furiously at the Saxon chieftains in his neighbourhood, he rote to be a Ring-certain it is that he had been magnified by Celtic patriotism at the time of the Conquest into a mnighty Prince, who had once avenged, by anticipation, upon the accursed Sassenach the woes which, after his time, the whole Celtic race had experienced at the hand of their national euemy. These tales of the great King were also current in Brittany,-a province which always kept up an intercourse with Wales; and at the time of the Conquest the adventures of King Arthur and his " Table Round," his peers and his wife, his victories and misfortunes, had been moulded into a cycle of romance destined to world-wide fame. In French literature these traditions succeeded to au older cycle, the "Chansons de Gestd," as they are called, which, recounting the great deeds of his 12 peers, revolve round Charlemagne as the sun and centre of the system. It is another proof of the flexibility of the Norman mind that at the Conquiest they seem almost entirely to have abandoned the old Niebelungen epos which was common to them with the Saxons, and to have adopted the cycles of Charlemagne from theFrauks, and of Arthur from their next neighbours the Bretons. The former, indeed, never became popular in England, but Arthur, to the great con-
t1lation of the W'elsh, who saw in the Normans 1hd a1'e4gers of their name and nation, stepped 1W to fl the void caused at Court and in knightly halls-in what was then polite society-by the banishment and degradation of the old Saxon songs. By their intrinsic beauty these Breton songs were well worthy the distinction they thus obtained. Their merit is proved by their universal acceptance as the exponents of all that was brave and strong in man, and tender and alluring and faseinating in woman. In all chivalry there was no braver or more noble Eing than Arthur, no fairer or more faithless Queen than Guiniver, no truer pair of lovers than Tristan and Isaul, no knight more faithful than Kaye, none so brave and amorous as Laneelot, none so virtuous as Gahahad. In England, as -we have aeen, they extirpated, assisted by accidental circumstances, the national epos, but even in Germany, with no conquest to help them, their victory over the national literature was little less complete. Though the old epos existed side by side with the new cycle, the greatest and most perfect poem of Gottfried of Strasburg, the greatest master of German mediTeval literature, is devoted to the loves of Tristan and Isault,whilealmost every branch of the cycle has been treated by a German hand. Nor was the extension of this cycle confined to Germany. It is found in Denmark, in Sweden, in Norway, nay, even in Iceland. It exerted an influence on the early Selavonic poetry, Spain and Italy were open to its charms, so that if there ever was a tradition which may be said to have made the circuit of the world it is this of Arthur and his Table R>ound. In England, as elsewhere, it remained from the Conquest till the 14th century the great storehouse from which were drawn thle tales of knightly prowess so gladly heard by gallant knights and lovely women in baronial haUs- but written at first in French, and afterwards in Anglish so laced and larded with French words as to be almost unintelligible, these tales were never popular with the English people, they never descended till a later period from the castle to the cabin, and down to the end of the 14th century at least eannot be considered as forming a part of English literature.
The early English metrical romances, such as Hornchilde and Wiiam and theWerewolfthe rhyming chronicles of Robert of Gloucester and Robert de Brunne, the various metrical paraphrases of portions of the Bible, the few uncouth ballads and songs of the time which have come down to us in their original shape,-all these, though they serve to illustrate the history of the language during the interval between King John and Edward III., can-
not aspire to the dignity of an English literature. i Such a literature first appears about the middle of the 14th century in The Vision awl Creed of Piers Plomghmant, the translations of the Bible by Wiclif and his followers, The Travels of Sir Johnl Maundeville, and in the works of Chaucer. A comparison of the works which bear the name of the Ploughman with those of the great poet of the gay Richard's Court will show at once how English the one is and how French the other in respect to its vocabulary. It was an old accusation against the father of English poetry, that "he was a great mingler of French with Englisb," and another early critic has charged him with importing " whole waggon-loads of words" into English. The learned andingenious Tyrrwhitt -who, to the shame of this century, is our last critical editor of Chaucer, though he lived three-quarters of a century ago-defends his author from this charge, and shows, as he thinks, that most of the French innovations attributed to Chaucer were owing to the Conquest. In Tvrrwhitt's time, the period between Chaucer and the Conquest was a literary waste, and therefore it is no wonder that, with his imperfect light, his account contains many mistakes. We have already seen what effect the Conquest really had, what effect the separation from Normandy in the reign of John had, and we have now to see what effect Edward IIL's conquests had on the English language and Chaucer in particular. Though the English conquered France, they were conquered mn turn by an enem y of another hind.
"Gnecja capta feram victorem cepit. et artes "Intulit aegresti Latiea"
-Without a literature themselves, they found one flourishing in France. The vera of the metrical romances bad passed away in that kingdom, and had been succeeded by a different kind of compositions. That was the age of allegorical poems, such as the " Romance of the Rose," to which Chaucer has given an English garb, and of whEich Gower's Con7fesslo A mantis is another specimen,poems which owe their origin to that semi-Platonic school that sprung up in Italy with the revival of Classical literature under Petrarch and Boccachio -a monstrous compound of medieval mysticism and Classical severity; a style which has deservedly perished with the half-consciousness of the age .which gave it birth. But, besides this style, which found many imitators in England, the English who visited France under the nctorious banner of Edward found another which was destined to become more popular and enduring because it was more natural. These were the Fabliaus, moral, quaint, or facetious tales in verse, of which one at least, Januari and lfMay, is well known to English readers al over the world. The origin of these tales is, in all probability, to be indirectly traced to Italy, though most of them were only new adaptations of old world-wide stories, brought in a gray antiquity by wandering tribes from the East. It is this kind of literature which we now find invading England; though there is little trace of it in the first half of the 14th century, it is in full flower with Chaucer at the end of that period. Much has been made of Chaucer's acquaintance with Italian, and because some of his tales are found in Petrarch or Boccachio it is asserted that we must look to Italy rather than France for the source of his inspirations. We believe that this view is entirely false, and, though it would take too much space to enter into the proof here, we have no doubt that his Canterbury Tales, almost without exception, may be traced to some French fabhau or moral tale. That he was an original poet, so far as his plots were concerned, cannot be admittled for a moment; his originality consisted in hIis happiness of adaptation, in the freshness and thoroughly English spirit and feeling which he threw into stories which in the orioinals are often tedious or disgusting, in his exquisite sense of humour, and the hearty love of nature which pervades his poetry. Like Shakspeare, he found his plots filth, and left them gold. This is the alobymy common to all great poets, with which by a touch of the wand they convert things trivial and vile and worthless in themselves into brilliant ereations of fancy. But along with his plots he imported words wholesale from France; they are sown broadcast in his works, and many of them remain to the present hour. In this respect his language cannot be said to be popular ; his language was certainly not as Spenser-" who," as Ben Jonson says, " himnself wrote no language"-has described, " a well of English undefiled," for it was filled with attempts to introduce many new words which, whatever may be the case now, could certainly not have been understood by the mass of English readers in his own time.

LErmTIS POR Trim METROPOLIS.-It Is often the case that important iMprovements are at fdrst attended with difficulty, and the recent division of the metropolis into ten districts, with a view to facilitate the delivery of letteis in London, does not form an exception to the rule. People are puzzled to find out in what particular district the place is situate to which they wish to direct their letters. Theie are, however, so much ingenuity and enterprise in the pre. sent day that as soon as any novel plan is adopted means are taken to enable the public to derive the best advantage from it. Some envelopes have been brought under our notice, manufactured by Messrs. Pinches, of Oxendon-street, which are stamped with the initials of the ten different metropolitan districts, so that the sender of a letter need not be at the trouble to mark the initial. Besides this, the principal places comprised in each postal district are plainly printed inside the envelope. By means of this list a person who receives a letter can easily find out the district in which the residence of his correspondent is situated, and can thns send his answer without trouble. These envelopes seem well calculated to effect the object in view.

Law Reports.
LAW REPORT&
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I venture to bring before your notice an abuse connected with our legal procedure, which you referred to very ably many months' since, but which seems to have escaped entirely the notice of law reformers-namely, the system of law reporting, a reform in which would be of great benefit both to the profession and the public.
Many columns of your paper have been from time to time filled with remarks on the codification of the statutes, and speeches without end (literaUy, for we are no nearer it now than three years since) have been delivered in both honses of Parliament on that subject. It has, however, generally been felt that even such codification would be of little practical benefit without some change in the system of law reporting, which has novv become a gigantic evil.
When an act of Parliament is passed no one-as generally is the case-understands its meaning, which remains in doubt till determined by "the Court." The case on which the opinion of " the Court" is taken is then reported, and until overruled or reversed by a higher authority is con. aidered " as law," and almost of the same legal value as an act of Parliament; and this legal value is also affixed to every decision emanating from "the Court" on every matter connected with our social state. These decisions now amount to an incredible number, our volumes of law reports being, perhaps, twenty times as numerous as those of our acts of Parliament.
The "regular reports" generally referred to are edited by well-known gentlemen, whose names are affixed to them; and, in addition to these reports, we have the Weekly P.eporter, the JTurist, and the Law0 Tim7es, published once a week, the aggregate amount of their cobt being something very considerable, as my bookseler's biln informs me at the end of the year.
The disgraceful delay in bringing out, and the high price of "the regular reporW"-which I shall shortly notice-gave birth to tho reports I have just enumerated, as a barrister has often to refer to a case lately decided, and which has not yet been published in " the regular reports ;" for I sup. pose you very well know that if your reporter took down accurately every word of a decision a judge would not even condescend to look at it; indeed, I have seen a well-known judge shrink with seeming horror from a newspaper tendered to him.
The disgraceful delay I have mentioned I will instance. I have just received from my bookseUer part 2 of volume 6 of De Gex, Macnaghten, and Gordon's Reports of tlc Decisions in the Court of Appeal. It contains merely the 13 cases followinz, opposite each of which I have placed the date of its decision, with the time elapsed since such decision was given.

The first seven of these cases were decided about two years since ! The reports have been published about a fortnight; when we shall have the remainder of the cases that were decided in 1855 I do not know; but I hope to see them before 18S, for you will remember that theso cases are now "law," and it is as requisite to know the "law of the courts" as it is to be acquainted with the law contained in an act of Parliament.
I mentioned the high price of these reports. The " part" in which the 13 cases enumerated above are reported con.sists of 230 pages of very large print, the margin of a page being actually of larger surface than the printed matter, and the ", part" costs 13s.,-just Is. a case! I hope, like the salmon provided for David Copperfield by his little wife at half a guinea a-pound, that the cases are worth the money, though they seem to me rather an expensive luxury.
But this is not all the expense. I have already paid for these cases twice before-once for the report in the weeklv paper, and once gain for it in the regular reports of the court below, from which the cases have been appealed.
An objection may be raised against me, "W Why, if you complain of these 230 pages, printed in this absurd manner being charged 13s.-why do you purchase them ?" I say I am just as much obliged to keep these reports for constant reference as I am to wear a wig and gown in court.
Again, cases are often reported in which no new principle is enunciated, but the decision in which merely goes on the facts of the cases themselves. This swells the volume, as also does the length of the reports. No one who is conversant with the old reports of 50 or 60 years since is not struck with the conciseness of them as compared with the new reports-I ought rather to say with the amplification of the new as compared with the old.
The evil is daily incroasing. I have heard the present Attorney-General say that the reports were accmmulating beyond even his power of mastering. Perhaps our bookahelves are loaded with 20 new volumes of reports a-year ! And remember, Sir, that the numerous acts of Parliament of which so much complaint is made only furnish us with one volume of lair every year. It would seem that the evil should be stopped, and the following is a remedy I would propose:-
L In each court there should be an officer of the court Io report such cases as the judge should think, from some new principlo evolved, worth being reported. (By the way, the officer should have a deputy, as he would have very little to do.)
2. The reports of all the courts should be published together, by order of the Lord Chancellor, about once a- month, and should he published at a moderate cost.
3. When a case has been re-argued before the Court of Appeal, having boen once stated in the reports, it should not be restated, but the decision on it merely.
In conclusion, your correspondent *"Mercator " says that the issue of bank-notes should bear a strict proportion to the amount of bullion in the Bank of England. Oh! that in legal matters the issue of the reports and their cost might be in some proportion with the bullon contained in them is the sincere wish of

The President and Council of the Royal Academy, departing in this instance from a rule which we understand has hitherto been rigidly adhered to, have consented t- allow a selection from the diploma works ot deceased academicians to be forwarded to the exhibition. The "dinloma pictures" are works presented to the Academy by artists, upon election to the full dignity of Royal Academicians. The presentation is required by tke Academy's laws, and er.h artist elected Presents the work supposed to be best illustrative of hischaracteristics or peculiaxities, as he himself understands them. To a certain extent these pictures may be retarded as forming of themselves a history of the British sehooL The Academy (founded in 1769) now possesses about 80 diploma pictures; but that siumber includes those of living artists, which, it wil be seen are not to be selected from. The liberality of the President. and Council will enable the executive committee to make such a selection as will be of very great interest to students of the British school.

ay most satisfaetory. The Council of the ArchieoloeicaJ Istitute have appointed asub-committee to assist in makinthat branch of the contents of the mnseum s complete ana attractive as possible. Among recent contributors Mr. Mayer, of Liverpool, stands distinguished. Hle has, with the greatest liberality, placed at the disposal of the committee the whole of his celebrated colections of Egyptiai. and Eastern antiquities, mediuval relies and artioles of vertl, and the unrivalled and deeply interesting collection of reHc& from Anglo-Saxon graves, wVhich was made by thelate Rev. Bryan Faussett. the refusal to purchase which bythe trustees of the British Museum excited the reprobation of antiquaries throughout the united kingdom, and which eventually was purchased by Mr. Mayer. This collection has been. partisay made known to thE public by Mr. C. Roach Smith's elaborate and splendidly illustrated work, the Inrent(n-ium. Sepulchrate, but no book could do full justice to so truly fine and perfectly unique a collection. 3Mr. Mayer recently purchased the noted colection made in London by Mr. Hertz, aud it is also placed at the disposal of the committee, and wiU no doubt be found in the exhibition. Mr. Mayer's kindness has not terminated with these most valuable contributions; he is zealously cooperating with the execative committee, and has undertaken to render all the assistance possible by his influence with collectors in Liverpool and the neighbourhood. Mr. Tite, M.P., will contribute several interesting wedi-eval works. The Natural History Society of Newcastle-upon-Tyne have permitted a selection to be made from their museum of crosiers, ivories, enamels, &c. Mr. Hailstone, of Horton-hall, near Bradford, who has long been known as an assiduous and able collector, and whoI was one of the active promoters of the exhibition at the Society of Arts in 1850, wiU be a contributor of fine specjmens of metal work, tapestry, and stained glass. 3r. Hailstone has also moat liberaUy undertaken to render all the practical assistance compatible with his enzagements, in active co-operation with Mr. Waring, in order to render this particular branch of the exhibition as complete and effective as possible.
The executive committee. after careful inquiries among the leading collectors in the kingdom, have appointed Mr. Edward Holmes, barrister, of London, to superintend the cel
lection and classification of works illustrative of the arts of engr_ving nd water-colour drawing. Mr. Holmes (assisted by Mr. . Smith, Messrs. Colnaghi, Messrs. Evans, and others in London) bas already received the most encouraging assurances of support from the principal possessors of the most rare and precious prints; and there can be lttle doubt that, under his superintendence, a coUection of water-colour drawings-a very popular and attractive division of the uine arts inthe present day-will be brought together such as has never yet been seen in this country. A spacious gallery has been allotted by the committee for these collections. Mr. Holmes has recentlT visited Liverpool ; through the kind assistance of Mr. G. W. Moss, banker, he has been permitted to examine all the chief coUections in that town and neighbourhood; *nd he has, upon all hands, met with the most hearty promises of support.
The committee have determined to allot a certain portion of the exhibition building for a colection of photographs; and they have intrusted the selection of specimens to Mr. Philip H. Delamotte, professor at King's College, London. The space that can be appropriated for the purpose will not, however, admit the exhibition of snore than about 1,000 specimens, and it wiU thus evidently be the duty of hlr. Dclamotte, of necessity, rigidly to exclude anything that is not of the highest merit or interest. A very attractive portion of this department will no doubt be a series (as complete as possible) of portraits of eminent men of the time.
In our recent announcement of tho contributioas of the High Sberiff of tho county of Worcester, Mr. Francis Tongue Rufford, Prescot-house, near Stourbridge, we gave a wrong description of the valuable specimens of the modern Rnglish schcos which he has placed at the disposal of the committee.

Alarming Accident At Manchester Cathedral.
ALAING AcCDFNT AT MANCHESTER CATHEDRAL. -During the celebration of divine service at the cathedral on Sunday afternoon, the congregation being a large one, an accident occurred, sufficiently alarming in itm nature, which caused for a few moments considerable panic among portions of the congregationi but fortunately it was unattended with any personal injury, so far as wo have heard. 1'he preacher, a relative, we believe, of the 1?ev. Canom Wray, had proceeded for about a-quarter of an hour with the sermon, when the cseupsnts of the pews in tho wvcsterly portion of the north gallery were startled by hearing a slight crack over head. Looking up to the ceiling of the gallery, tbey almost immediately aterwards saw the whole of the ornamental plaster moulding which covered a beam crossing the gallery from front to back suddenly separate from the beam and faU upon the pews below with a loud crash. Great was the alarm, especially among the ladies occupying seats in this part of the church; indeed, most of the occupants in the pews throughout the north gaUery left them on the instant, some gentlemen even climbing over the tops of the pews, and rapidly made their way towards the two flights of stairs at the extremities of the gaUery. The preacher, thus suddenly arrested in his discourse, renained silent, looking vith some anxiety towards that part of the gallery where the crash occurred; but this stat-e of suspense was judiciously terminated by the IRev. Canon Wray rising in the reading desk and quietly proaouncing the benediction usual at the close of the service, which was thus brought to a sudden termination. The alarm had, however, to some extent by this time subsided, and many of the congregation, so far from quittingthe church, remained to see and inquire for themselves as to thenature of the accident. We learn tlihLt all the plaster which had covered tho oaken beam with moulding fell away from it, leaving the beam bare; and that it would be from 15 to 18 feet in length, and weighing probably 12 to 14 owt. That so large a mass of plaster should fall from a height of many feet among the pews without injuring a single person is remarkable; but it seems that the line of the beam wvas precisely over the line of partition which separates the block of news into two sections, having entrances at opposito ends; and so the plaster fell in masses upon this partition, thus breaking its fall, before it droppod in large fragments into the pews. One of these pieces is said to have been of the weight of at least llcwt. It is supposed that the plastor was applied to cover the beam during the repairs and alterations in the interior of the church about the year 1824, but we have not heardl any reliable opinion as to the cause which has loosened it an led to its fall. The gallery was erected in 1814 or 1815, and the late Mr. Palmer, architect, in iis description of the interior of the church, says, of the navo, that "the roofs of the side aisles, which had hitherto been open to the rafters, were each of them now ceiled over, and worked into compartments corresponding with those in the nave, and the intersections decorated with orbs, leaves, and flowers The pillars, arches, and divisions between the smaller side aisles, together with the wals, were also cemented over, to harmonize with the general improvements. These works were completed about tho year 1819." He speaks elsewhere of " the addition of more than an inch of iRoman) cement in thickness upon the surface of the mouldangs on the Wilars and arches; but whethertfis applies also to tho 3nouldings of the ceiling does not appear. Doubtlesscompetent persons will be appointed to exanine and report on the state of the ceiling, not only of the north gallery, blt of other parts of the nave, so that any apprehensions of the congregation mny be allayed.-JIfanci,ester (itwzruMien.

PARIS, SuxIAY, JAn. 18, 6 P.,x.
Public opinion has seldom, if ever, expres3ed italf more unanimously on any subject than on the verdict of the jury in the case of Verger, and his condemnation to the extreme penalty of the law has been received with approbation, in which I have not heard one dissentient voice. His audacious avowal of the crime, his glorying in it, his outrac,eous deportment during tho trial, and his insults'to the Court and vwitnesses, produced a universal feeling of disgust and horror. Hie evidently intended to excite a great^scandal, and, knowing that there was no chance of escape for himself, he hoped to gratify his malignity by doing all that one like him could do to destroy the character of others. As he had not sacrificed them by the same means as he had used against the Archbishop, he brooded with gloomy rapture on the murder of their representative. To that list of witnesses which he showed to his advocate he had appended notes imputing the most abominiable crimes to all and each; and it is curious that this ferocity was particularly exhibited towards those who had rendered him the greatest services, and who were known to be his benefactors. These witnesses were not expected by him to depose to the fact before the Court, and were therefore, with the exception of three, refused by it. The only defence that could be made for him was insanity, and it was put forward but faintly and doubtingly by his counsel. The evidence of the medical man 'who had examined him was not in favour of this view of the case. His impression was that the prisoner was not mad, but was very dangerous. His fits of rage he at first thought might be at. tributed to a tendency to epilepsy; on minute inquiry) he found nothing to confurm that opinion, and his conclusiou was that he was rather a fit subject for the vigilance of the police authorities than for a madhouse. On the whole, it would appear that he was a man eaten up by inordinate vanity, of a morbid desire to make himself talked of, whother for good or for evil, superficially instructed, of a jealousy that never reposed, envy that ever corroded, and hatred of all who he thought came in his way; constantly intriguing against, or quarrelling with, his fellowpriests; impressed with an exaggerated idea of his own importance; of ambitionwhich there was nothing to justify; of a perverse and gloomy disposition, and a heart fuUl of rancour and malignity aganst every one who was his superior. 1is disnissal from the various situations he filled was the consequence of the irregularity of his morals, and he repaid the Cur6 of St. Germiain rAuxerrois for his kindness to him, until kindness and charity were exhausted, by the most abominable calumnies.
The impression produced by the murder of the Archbishop is far from being dimlnished; it wi'l not be soon effaced from the minds of those who do not view the events of the day superficially. I have already alluded to the effect produced among those of higher station. It is quite natural that it should be so; the higher persons are placed the more they are struck with the signs which indicate the secret and fearful malady by which modern society is corroded. In the middle ages it was the watchmen stationed in the steeples of the churches who were the first warned of the danger which menaced the population.
Verger is not a criminal who really belongs to any order of society; he is simply one of those exceptional characters who appear now and then for the shame and disgrace of humanity. Nevertheless, the fact of his indelible character as a priest has caused several serious persons to reflect on the means of preventing, if possible, the repetition of such a crime. Previous to the revolution of 1789, while the clergy possessed its privileges, like the other orders of the State, interdicted ecclesiastics used to be removed from society and placed in convents or in ecclesiastical prisons. The Revolution very properly destroyed that privilege, as it levelled all others, and deprived the superior clergy of the power which it had over its members. All that a bishop can now do in the way of punishment is simply to deprive the irregular member of his " function" as a priest. But the interdicted priest has no resource. His education and his habits unfit him to enter upon any other career. He is too advanced in years to learn a mechanical trade by which he may gain a livelihood. He is thrown back on society, and society refuses to receive hlim; and, among Catholics even the most lax in religious observances, the interdicted priest is regarded with suspicion and dislike. The only avocation lie can apply hinself to is teachlng9,but who would intrust his children to the care of a man on whom the indelible stigma of suspension rests? It may be a prejudice, but, generally speaking, the fact is as I state. If he has no resources of his own, he is lost. Independently of the vices wlich have led to his exclusion from the religicus corporation of which he was a member, he is exposed to the worst examples and the worst society, to teliptations of every kind, and to the constant struggle against misery-the males1ada fames.
The Catholic clergy in France is of all others who receive support from the State the lowest in the scale of remuneration. In the arrondissement of Meatux, for instance, to which diocese Verger bhlonged, the Protestant clergyman receives, at the lowest, an allowance of 1,500f., fixed, from the Government, and from the department 200f. to defray the expense of his pastoral visitations, independently of donations from those of the same faith confided to his care. It is true that the claims on him as a father of a family are greater than on the Catholic clergyman, but I am told he can perfo.m other functions which are forbidden to his cowfr,re, and which are more or less recompensed. The present Emperor has done something to improve the condition of the superior Catholic ecclesiastics. The Cardinals, for instance, are Senators by right, and they receive the salary attached to the office. The Archbishops have a small sum in addition to their incomes as prelates. The Bishops of the first class (the classification gives no pre-eminence, but is onily according to the extent and importance of the diocess) r eceive anincomeof 25,000f.,or 1,0001.; those of the second-class 15,000f (6001.), and those of the third 10,000f., or 4001. per annum. These emolumients are not excessive, and as the superior clergy are not now, as formerly, recruited from the upper or wealthier classes of society, they seldom or never possess any private property. But the real difficulty begias when we descend to the inferior orders of the clergy. The emolument derived from the State by the parish priests of a large city, of the principal town of a department or of an arrondissement, is 1,500f., or 60/. This is the first class. A curg, or parish priest of the second class, receives only 1,200f., and those who are attached to the service of a country church 850f., or 341.; these last form the iumense majority of the 40,000 members of the secular clergy in France. Of that sum of 850f. the 50f. has been added only very recently. In compensation for the immense property of 'which the clergy were deprived at the Revolution, the law of the 2d of November, 1789, prescribed that the emolument of each parish priest should not be less than 1,200£. Owing to the iucreased value of every article of necessity 1,200f. then was equivalent to double that sum now. I should have said that in addition to the sum of 850f. just mentioned, the commune gives from 100f. to 150f. There remains what is termed the casued, which is made up of a small fee from masses for particular objects, for marriages aund interments, and a few occasional offerings. The
rural clergy, as well as those of the townis, are called upon to contribute from 20f. to 25f. every year in support of a find for the relief of the old and infirm members of the clergy. The casuel is affected by many accidents. A bad harvest diminishes or sometimes even suppresses it entirely, and it is precisely in periods of scarcity that the calls on the charity of the priests are most numerous and most urgent. The first door the poor knock at for relief in their destitution is that of the cur6; and it must be said they rarely knock in vain. When it is remembered that there are not less than 30,000 of the French clergy in this straitened and precarious position, their resignation, their honourable conduct, and their morality, with rare exceptions, amid the scandals which society in every class presents, are worthy of all praise.
I have already informed you that Verger hasthree days to appeal to the Court of Cassation. If he appeals he will have 40 days more; but it is not probable that the sentence of the Court of Assize will be annulled.
At 7 o'clock last evening the clerks of the Court repaired to the prison of the Conciergerie, where Verger is confined. They entered his cell, and an-
nounced tht they had come, in conformity with the law of the lt`ho ptember,183I,to read to him the copy of the minutis of the trial after he had been removed from the court. Verger was then somewhat calm,* he stood up, and declared that he was ready to Lear them. After the reading of the minutes and of the sentence of the Court he became suddenly much excited, and addressing the clerks; he cried out, "Now, Sirs, ie off-get away-ad) minister justice. You aso shall be condemned. Quit thi place. I drive you from my presence, and I despise you r"
The governor of the prison at once gave orders that Verger ehould put on the dress appropriated to those under sentence of death. It consists of a camisole de force, or 'etraitwaistcoat. He made no resistance, nor used any violent words, wbile the operation was going on. He merely said, " I know now that I am no longer my own master."
He passed the night quietly, and even slept soundly, and tis morning eemed quite calm. The Governor inquired if there was anything he wished for. "I desire," he said, "to appeal to the Court of Causation at once." He was informed that it was impossible to do so to-day (Sunday), but the governor proinsed hin that early to-morrow he should communicate his demand to the clerks of the Court.
"There is another service Ihave now to ask you," Verger said. "' I wish to address a petition for parcon to the Emperor, but I cannot write it myself, as this camisole impedes the use of my hands." He was informed that he could dictate his petition, ind that he should have his hands at liberty to sI-g it. Verger thanked the governor. He was then asked if he had any objection to receive the chaplain of the Conciergerie, who was anxious to see and console him. "lagree, with pleasure," was the reply. the Abbe Nottelet was then introduced, and the momenthe enteredhereceived him with the greatest apparent satisfaction. The governor and his attendants then retired to some distance, in order to allow the chaplain to have an opportunity of conversing with him. The effect of the conference seemed to be favourable. Verger appeared nitore tranquil, and he made the chaplain promise he would visit him again to-morrow.
It appears that the letter said to be dated from the Tuileries, and which was publixhed in the Swiss papers, and copied into the Presse, is a forgery. The following letter on the subject has been addressed to the editor of the Presse by M. Mocquard, the Emperor's Secretary:-
"Palace of the Tuileries, Jan. 17.
"Monsieur le Rdacteur en Chef,-The Presse. in its nuinber of Friday afternoon, the 16th of January, contains, on the affairs of Switzerland, a letter which it attributes to the Secretariat of the Emperor. Never did suoh a letter originate in the Secretariat of His Majesty.
"I beg you to please to Inert the prceset dcation in the n3ext number of your journal, and I offer you, Monsieur le RMdacteur en Ohef, the assurance of my distinguished consideration."
The Monitekw, adds that the Presse and the Estafette, which copied the letter from the Swiss papers, are to be prosecuted.
A private letter from Naples of the 12th mentions that fresh arrests have been made there, which were supposed to have connexion with a secret society in correspondence with a Mazzinian club in Genoa and Turin. Pieces of money are also said to have been discovered newly coined, and stampedwith the effigy of Lucien i., King of the Two Sicilies. Some of the parties arrested were subsequently released; the others are still in custody, and an investigaton is going on. The list of pardons was not pbihdat the date of the letter, but it was said that notwith. standing what has recentlyoccurred,and tie sinister reports that circulate, the list will appear before long.
The news of the assassination of the Archbishop of Paris led to the countermanding the fetes and balls which were to be given on the anniversary of the birth of theKing (the 12th inst.), and the theatres were closed. There was, however, a grand reception at the palace, at which al the members of the diplomatic corps at Naples were present. The English frigate Malacca hoisted its colours, and fired a salute of 21 guns. The King was to leave Naples soon for Caserta, where the Queen will be confined.

BERLIN, JAr. 17.
It was not till late yesterday evening it got wind that the Swiss Council of Estates (the upper portion of the Federal Assembly, of which the National Council forms the popular but more influential lower half) had that same day, by a majority of 33 against 12, accepted the proposals laid before it by the Administrative Federal Council. On the day preceding, the 15th, the National Council had also resumed the debate adjourned from the previous day, and accepted the proposals of the Federal Council by a majority of 91 to 4. This resolution of the lower but more influential half of the Federal Assembly was known here by telegraph late in the day of the 15th, which was the extreme term fixed by the King for keeping back the order for mobilization; the intelligence, though it did not amount to an acceptance of the proposals made by the Federal Council for the liberation of the prisoners, was still further removed from a rejection of them; and the Mhinisterial Council, which sat till very late in the night of the 15th, resolved under the circumstances not to promulgate the order for mobilization, which they held in their hands sined ready for use in case the proposals had been rejected. A morning paper, which is sometimes used for the purpose of communicating Ministerial ideas in a non-official form, says in connexion with this,-
" This resolution of one constituent part of the Federal Assembly appears to justify the assumption that Switzerland is disposed to appreciate at theirdue value the demands made by Prussia, and is sincerely desirous of a paoiiic settlement. In all probability it is these views that have led to the order ofr mobilization, which, as we hear from good authority, was yesterday signed by IHi Majesty, not having been as yet sent off to its destination."
We shall doubtless hear very shortly of the prisoners having been released. I need not tell you that the resolution of the representative bodies of Switzerland to do this by quashing the proceedings, against them is a matter of very great satisfaction here; it was to obtain this_that Prussia had
resolved to appeal to arms. The question of the recognition and restoration of the sovereignty formed in no other way the motive for this intended military action than that the abstract question itself was invelved indirectly in this practical aet, demanded on the one aide and refused by the other. After the liberation of the prisoners has taken place a Conference will be arranged to be held by the five great Powers, with the addition of Switzerland, with, a view to the eventual commutation, or, perhaps, unconditional resignation, of the King's sovereiguty; this assistance of a representative of Switzerland at such a Conference will asio be a tacit acknowledgment of the real existence of the King's right de jntre, and as such a further cause of satisfaction in the highest quarter here. Nor wiUl the eventual cession of those rights, with adequate or inadequate compensation, be any source of regret to the statesmen and people of Prussia, nor even with the King a matter of such grievance as in any way to make him unreasonable.
The publicitv given to the various diplomatic steps taken in this NeuchWtel affair by the messages of the Federal Councl to the Federal Asembly is, perhaps, the cause of the rapidity with which the text of the various documents themselves has come to light. Since I last wrote we have hadan opportunity of reading four further additions to the diplomatic ccrespondence already published. Taken in chronological order, the first is a Prussian de-

1inistdr -at -VieV"n, -reDing thej attempts mnade by Austria to hamper Prussia?.a minitatlr arrangements, by insisting thiat all negotiations for tha mnarch of Prussiati troops through F eeral territory must be submitted to the deliberations of the Bund. This is the despatch of whichColonelvonMankeffel was the bearer to Vienna, in addition to the Ostensible one rejecting the proposal for submitting the Neuchhtel affair to a Conference before the liberation of the prisones.
The next in point of time is a short note from Paris of January 6, addressed to the Swiss Government; i is that note which has led decisively to the poresent sa factory turn that affairs have taken; but, so far from containing anything like a a
rantee on the part of the Emperor Lous Napoleon that the King of Prussia would give up his sOvereignty on the release of the prisoners it says diitinctly-
"The Government of His Majesty the Emperor 'prendc PGngagemeni de faire tou sce efforl,' after the liberation o' the prisoners, to procure a solution of the affair agreeablh to the wishes of Switzerland."
The last is the Austrian note of January 9, addressed to the Swiss Govermment, in which the danger is shown of the Swiss Government persist. ingin not liberating the prisoners, and the prospect held oe that the yielding of this point by Switzerland would constitute a claim on the indulgent consideration of the four Great Powera when the matter comes before a Conference for final xettlement.

NEW YORK, JAi. 3.
If the present letter contains nothing that relates to business or politics, or what is cled news, it will only obey the spirit of the time; for a brief space festivity and social observances, moulded by tradition, have the upper hand even of debates on slavery and the course of exchange. Without these topics the mail you will receive by this steamer is likely to be a meagre one, unless a little of the social doings of the season 1s thrown in. New York has boeen keeping holyday, an indulgence it seldom
,-so seldomi sedo
allows itswlft-doescit,' that it may be interesting to know how it doesit, having so little practice in the art.
The three holydays of the American year are, in the North, the Thanksgiving-day, fixed by the Governor of each State, generally in November, when, once in four years at least, the escape from the Presidential election is a just cause of gratitude; New Year's-day, and the 4th of July. Christmas-day is not observed so decidedly as to entitle it to mention; though not quite disregarded, it is not considered a total holyday. In the New England States the people have transferred the celebrations theyrefuse itto the official and traditional Thanksgiving-day, originally a tribute of prayer and sermons in acknowledgment of the happy harvest that saved the fir3t colony of the Pilgrim Fathers from starvation, but in after times expanded by their descendants into a day of festivity-a natural and laudable ilustration of the theory of development. On this day the race of the Puritan stock meet in family gatherings, and the turkey falls a sacrifice to them as numerously as at the period so fatal to that fowl in Norfolk of the old country. Of other aids of festivity it is difficult to speak with the same certainty in the region of stringent liquor laws; biit it is whispered they are not wanting, the strong statutes applying only to the public sale of wine and alcohol, not to the private consumption thereof, which may be left in the algebraic uncertainty of an unknown quantity. Something of the old quarrel with mnince pie and the disparagement of the materials of appointed feasting which began in England still remains; but the innate necessity of some point of time to break tlie hard monotony of life has triumphed, and the descendants of the Puritans have now a newer tradition of their own, and a day according to it that answers the purpose. The Pilgrims were a great race of men, but they were a little too hard on amusement, something peevish that way, and overdid the thing, the old Adam breaking out even among themselves in unexpected places. lawthorne (of the Seven Gables and &arlet Letter), who has studied their colonial history, says he has not been able to discover that these stern fathers ever indulged in merriment, except at funerals ! On such occasions they relaxed, and cultivated a grim kind of joviality. That this could continue was impossible; as a consequence, Boston has not only Thanksgiving-day, butfour theatres. Christmas, however, is ignored to this hour. In New York the Puritan spirit was never so marked. The theology of the Dutch settlement was as decided, perhaps, but its practice was not the same-not quite so rigid. The pastors preached in Geneva cloaks, and the sermons were long enough, ut the Flemish and German nature was always more genial, and imported some cheerful observances which their descendants not only retained but, have handed down to the present time. New York still keeps Christmas, principally for the behoof of the children, to 'whom St. Claus still brings his nocturnal gifts of toys. There is a brisk business in Broadway arising out of the custom, and there are presents to be made to those of larger growth-books and jewelry, and articles costly and indescribable, and indescribably costly. Trade is not suspended but increased, and the outdoor traffic of the day is imusually active. In the Episcopal and the Dutch church there is divine worship, but the religious element does not predominate. The evening of Christmas-day is the great night of the theatres; at the "Bowery," and other houses of the second clas-the Surreys and Victorias of the citvthey give two performances, an extra one in the afternoon; but there is no Christmas-eve and no "Boxing-day."
The real filte of the season, however, is New Year's-day; it is kept as a close holyday by everybody, rich and poor; there is no work, no shops are open, and even those abodes of unrest, the ne,wspaper offices, give all their machines, editors included, a respite. Yesterday morning New York breakfasted without a journal; next to the sam omitting to rise it is the greatest proof of the general suspension of ordinary life. It is only the usual life, however, that is suspended; another kind of activity takes its place, and continues in full rush till evenin. The day is devoted by all classes to calling on each other with wishes of a happv new year. This is also a custom of Dutch origin, unknown out of New York. Those who have a large circle of acquaintance have a busy time of it - it is a thing that muat be done a call on New Year'sday covering a multitude of sins of omission during the past year, while neglecting the complimen,t aggravates them, converting them almost iao the cut direct. The ladies stay at home to receive the visits, the gentlemen alone paying them; the effect on the appearanoe of the streets is peculiax
there is not a lady to be seen; the black coats have all the pavements to themselves; all bright colours have disappeared from the prome. uades, and, though the loss of brMiancy ISvery marked, the gain of space is considerable; the difference made by the su traction of hoops and skirts is amazing. The carriages dashing by are full of men, the omnibuses are packed with men; the e are maen everywhere, as if all the female portion of the community had been sent out of tho ecity, n expectation of a siege. Any stranger landing from Europe onk the 1st of January 'would have thoug:.t New York bewitched and under a very evilsapelI indeed, unless a native took him in charge and, like a kindly Asmodeus, dissipated his misgivl^-
by showing. him.-the_bright and cheerful inI ~ ikrors the, vanished- ladies sit in A tat, goreouply apparelled, disp'efisam sm4eg ibdm refresxnentA to 411W comners. The gentle. men of the house. are not to be seen; they are on thettoUnd of visits elsewhere. It is a. harvest day of profit to the hack drivers, as frorathe expansion of the city he has very few acquaintance, very exceptiohally located, who can make his calls on foot. By rule the snow ought to be on the ground, to admit of sleighing; a dash down the long avenues in a neatly turned out sledge, with a pair of faat horses in gayharness and strings of silver bells, is an animating addition to the holyday. Bat this year the skies are perverse; there have only been a few threats of snow, and that at Christmas-just enough to tempt out a few sledges, give them a few hours run, and then by a dull thaw let them down to the atones, on which the gratin; and thumping soon disgusted the most enthusiastic lovers of the exercise, and sent them to wheels again. Last year the winter waa unusuualy severe, and onNevw Year,'day there was a double slede road along the whole of Broadway, with a high dividing ridge of snow between, which cost the corporation something incredible in dollars to remove. This year sledging has been an experiment only, soon abandoned, the " liding cars, indebted to no wheels," merely coming out and going in again, while all the public vehicles, so to speak, kept their feet. The day was clear and open, and rather muddy withal, while, provoldngly, there is this morning a fine coating o snow on the ground, just too late. On favourable occasiong sledges are in such demand that strong prices are paid for the hire of a dashing turn-out. Some of them are very brilliantly appointed indeed; but whatever the vehicles employed the duty of the day must be done.
In the dmple days of the Dutch dynasty, when the city was only a smaUl corner of the present metropolis, and when the residences of wealth and respectability (fashion is of more modern growth) were grouped round the Battery, the old Knickerbockers could pay their visits leisurely, and on foot, with time enough t3o discuss a dram sedately and fill their capacious pockets with cake, aS the manner was; now, all thoe who can be visited dwell far from the city proper, scattered over miles of avenues, to say nothing of lateral streets from " Eighth" to "Fortieth." I now requires an early start, a good pair of horses, anitolerablyhard workto get through a moderate list by twilight. There is also a peril of detention where the fires are so bright on the marble hearths, the toilettes so brUliant, and the ottomans so inviting; there are costly gifts of the season to be shown &nd examined,, diamond bracelets or gigantic bouquets of exotics; there is also exquisite Madeira proffered, only to be found in certain ancient cellars. Altogether, without the support of a stern sense of duty the round of visits may be brought to an abrupt conclusion, and all parties agree to make a day of it, leaving the rest of the list of friends to fate and the next year. Generally, however, a few minutes suffice for each visit; you are relieved by new comers and depart. Formerly, when the city and " society" were smaller, and everybody had more time, the hospitality of the day, frequently tested and longor indulged, was somewhat perilous, and the staircases ascended late in the day were apt to grow unaccountably narrow and perplexng; aU this has been changed for the better, the style of things is lighter and more elegant, the refreshment table is not the main feature of the day-it is an agreeable part of the decorations, and little more. On the whole, the custom is a pleasant one, and deserves not to die out; yet it is to be feared the continual extension of the city will make it more and more difficult to comply with every year, and it may gradually degenerate, as it has done in Germany, to an annual leaving of cards, a poor, formal process, which may be abandoned without loss.
A round of New York interiors on Wew Year'sdav leaves a very distinct impression of the luxury and love of decoration which the wealth of this commercial communityhas produced. Many of thepalaces of Europe must look meagre and bare to any one accustomed to the rich and lavish comfort of most of the fashionable mansions. Those of the Fifth Avenue have the most celebrity, but there are others in older quarters superior in many respects, though not so striking externally. The attempt to make the most of smaU space in the grand street has compelled some contrivances that contrast disadvantageously
with the outside splendour. The palatial faade is' obtained at the expense of room within, and the attempt to produce the effect of a mansion on 16 feet of frontage results in something which justifies the application of the American adjective "bormus," otherwise sham. The older houses on lluasonmsquare and some of the side streets are far nobler in their interior proportions; but they are all admirably warmed, and fully, softly, and richly farnished,-very Castles of Tndolence. The modern republic has nothing to learn from any empire, French or Roman; and now and then a growl may be heard from some Juvenal, condemning the general tendency to extravagance; but the age of republican simplicity has departed for New York. It is commercial, wealthy, showy, and luxzuriousthose who are "roasting turnips on their Sabine farms " are in the " Far West."

ARCJI7RT V -rAiT--,.S
(Before MA Loiru C -w - ,iY `
This was an appeal from a decreo of Vice-Chancellor Stuart relatimg to the rules of a building sodety, called "The Free Trade Investment Association.T The bi1 was filed by a mortgaging member of the society anst the trustees, and it prayed that on the redep tion'of his shares the plaintiff might be paid a bonurs of in1 per share that being the rate of pxyment fixed by the directors to be made to withdrawing members. The claim of the plaintiff was based upon the well-known case of "Fleming v. Self" in this codrt, which decided that a mortgaging mnembor on redemption was in the samne position as a withdraving member. It appeared that, although the resolution of the directors awarding 231. a-share to withdrtwing members had been passed long since the decision of " Fleming v. Self," the bonus had not been calcuated on the footing that redeeming members were entitled to participate in it. The trustees, therefore, refused to py the claim, on the ground that the calculation had been made in trror, and urged athat the liability of the societyought not to be carried beyond 71. per share, which would be the corrected estimate to meet all claims similar in character to that of the plaintiff. The rice-Chancellor considered him. self bound by the decision of " Fleming v. Self," and Inad a decree in favour of the plaintiff with costs, as the defendants disregarded that case.
Mr, Malins and Mr. HIardy for the plaintiff, as it as uan appeal from the whole decree, opened the case; Xr.lBacon and Mr. T. Terrell appeared for the appellants.
The LORD CHANCELLOR, without cslling for a repIl, said he had nodoubtupon the case. The plaintiff was clearly (lntitled to the benefit of the resolution of the directors, and was not to be reduced to their after calculation. The only remedy for the error fallen into by the directors was for them to pass another resolution declaring their previous calculations erroneoas, and that aRl future withdrawin
members would only be entitled to receive such a sum as the funds of the society would allow. As,however the matter at present stood, the directors, havin fixed th
bonus by their own rule apt 231, were concluded by the casee of "Fleming v. Self," and therefore the appe must be dismissed with costs.

sMt= V. LAKEIrAl.
The dispute in this case, which comes before the Court upon an appeal motion, and also for the hearing of the cause by arrangement between the parties, relates to'
accunt of 10,000 shares in the IUberty Mining Comnpanay, which Captain Smith, of Virginia, in the UnCted States, placed in the hands of vr. Lakeman to dispose of and upon whichL transaction Captain Smith claims to be enltitled to 9,0001., or more, while, on, thep of Mr. Lakeman, it is insistedthat the a taintm ent aort, himn lher amount.

MrC.e AiG declined to cross-examine this witnesg.
LordJ`ustice KNiG MTBRuc cross-examineaMr. Loakeman, who, in answer to his questions, swore that on the day mentionedinthebill,inJanusry,1853, theacoountwas iged that the night beore the Captain and himselfwentto the theatre, and afterwards went to No. 3, Park-place ; that there were two ladies prhesnt; that the evening and ir ht were wpnt th e; that they had supper there, and break st the next morning; that nothing was said about the matters which are in dispithe in the suit; no accounts were spoke
of, no business was done, nor paer signed, either in the evening or morning. Next morning witness left for St. John's-wood, and the CaU ptai left, but did not accom-
any him. Mr. Lakeman hen entered into a ful detail of 1he ope orat n caled " rigging the market, and said that the Liberty shares could not have been sold at al unla the process ha been adopted. ihe (mr. Lakeman) was a dealer in shars but was not, nor ever had been, a member of the Stock-Exchange. No member of that society need be eom ployed in the operation of "rigging the mnarket."
Xe-examined by Mr. WIGRitie-The directors of the Liberty Company had themselves before rigged the market. The lasst sares witness had sold were about a twelvemonth ago for Is per share, he bha i been offered 7d. per share, ut would not take it. The sares were utterly worthless, and every representation made of the value of the mines was wholly fals.
Captain Smith, examineaby Mr. CRAIG, deposed that he signed the account, but there were several mnaterial errors in it. Never recived many of the larger items charged against him. Never agreed to give Ikmanx 2,000 shares in the WaUter mine. The account was not sign in January, but on the mrneing of the 20th of FeaUry, 1853. The paper was in Lakeman's handwriting,and was prepared in the dining-room of No. 3, Park-place. No ladgies werIresent. He signed in the morning. Lakeman reprosen' it to be a true account of the mioney ho had paid to or for witness. Objected to sign, but dlid so on akenan's representations, that ho had securities for his money in his safe. Had entiregconfidence in Lakeman, and therefore signedrthe pappe. e saidthatwitness was assured thathe was sti a debtor to Lakeman. emembered that a servant in livery was sent out to buy two sheets of paper from a pub. lichouse, one sheet of which was used by Lakeman to writesa letter, and on the other the account was written. Lakeman was known as Captain Markham in Park-place. Upon a payer mbarked "n 4" being put into the witness's hand, be said, "I never signed that account. I signed the paper when blank al but a line or more at the top, and the top has been cut or torn off, and an account set out above ny signatoure. I am positive I never signed that (which is called the settled account). I never authorized Lakernan to make fictitious sales of shares. The Liberty Mines did belong to me. Isod the property. It is very valuable."
Cross-examined by Mr. MANensTy.-He was largely interested in real estate. Had attended to much business du rin his life. Never was engaged it getting up companies. Sold Liberty and Waloer property for shares andioney, -in the the latter '5,000 shares. Was never present at any meeting wbere the sale or mode of saleoof the shares was discussed. All shares he had ever sold, whether Wealer or other shares, were done through regular brokers, and he re ived sold notes and accounts current from them; hadtsold Liberty shares, when and as he could, and had some gtill in hand. In 1851 became acquainted with Laakemanh did not "know him"~-wished he had - considered him iri 1853 a man of energy, honour, and of businessbabits, or would not have trusted him w kith 10,000 shares.
E-amined from the Dench.-Was over perauaded to go to Park-place; o slept there. Sat up til 4 o'clock on Surtday morniwg. Did not know whether both ladies slept in the house. In th m orning saw the lady casedMrtos. Markhamn in bed with Lakemani. When he woke found the other lady in edwithimself. f a tehouse as soonral hecould after breakfast. Had been there once since, and that wfas to leave a 201-note for Mrs. Markham. Did not remember ever again seeing the other lady. Was born in 1798. Nover ohterved the mistake in the date of the account until after the fixrst bl in this eause was filed. [The witne aunderwent a very long examination upon this point, but adhered to his sttement.] Had heard of the term "origging the market," but never did anything of the sort, or authorized it to be done,lin regard to the LibeMy or any other shares. Mtossrs. Field, Son, and Wood, and other respectablebroe-rs, were always engaged by witness in the sale of shares.
Mr. Riddell was called by Mr. CRAig, but from some miistake had not attended. He was ordered to attend on Thursday morning, when the case isnto be arranged as to the terms of the issues to be trziea at law.
Lord Justice K?IGsET BRUCE asked Captain Smith if he adhered to his statement about the signature to a blank pape over whioh an account had been written?
The witnessrepliedl that he solemnly, deliberately, and emnphatically swore to the truth of that assertion. He added thaLt Mr. Lakemnau was also known as General Mfarkham, and that lie (the Captain) was entitled to a suin of no less than 9,0001. from him in respect of tho shares.
Their LoRDSiRrS finally determined that they could not settle the dispute without the assistance of a court of law, and expressed their regret that Captain Smith, after a delay of threea years, should be put to the additional inconvenience of awaiting another trial.

This motion was heard shortly before the Christmas recess, and his Honour, wishing to consult the taxing-master on the point involved, eserved his decision.
Mr. Cottrell appeared in Support of the motion; Mr. Greene opposed it,
The VIo-CR"czLw oa now said that this was a motion by a Mr. Austin, seekng to vary an order made on the 1uth day of December, whereby he was ordered to attend before the examser withinfour days of service to ive evidence for the defendants on his affidavit, aYd il de. fault to atand committed, and pay the costs of the application. The circumstances were these --Mr. Austin, being a party to the suit, wasuanbp.ened by the defen ants on evidence given on affidavit, the accompanying notice stating that he was to attend on Mondaiy, the 2d of December. That was a mistake, Nonday being the lst, and they stated that they intended him to attend on Monday; the effect of that must fall on the defendants. Mr. Anstn attended on Monday, and fouind that he was not wanted, and again on Tuesday and Wednesday, when he was caLUed upon to be examined, but declined giving evidence unless he was paid five guineas. The defendanW solicitor offered him one, two, and then three guineas, bat he still declined, and in consequence was not examined; and the defendants then *pplied for an order ex parte that he should attend within four days at his own expense. Mr. Austin attended, and was examined. Two questions were raised-fist, whether a witness w;s entitled to bo paid, not only his travelling expenses (which he was entitled to), but for his loss of time; and, secondly, supposing he was entitled to such compensation, what was the amount of such compensation ? The effect of the cases, on the 5th of Elizaboth, c. 9, s. 12, as it appeared to his Honour, was, upon principle, that a witness was not entitled to anything for loss of time. He was entitled to travelling expenses, and if he was Absent from home for many hours he would be entitled to his expenses for maintenance during that time. Both these classes of expenses would be ascertasned by reference to the witness's position in life, because a labourer would not be entitled to the same remuneration as a professional man. That principle was carefully determined in the case of " Collins v. Godefroy " (I B. and Ad., 490). There an action was brought by a witness, and the Court decided that a witness was.not entitled to anything for loss of time. That did not affect the question whether, not having demanded anything when hoe was examined, he could afterwards enforce a claim for compensation, for the whole question was whetherbhe was entitled to compeasation, and it was decided that he was not. The case of " Brocas v. Lloyd" (4 Weckly Reporter, 540) was to the same effect. In that case the Master of the ollos consulted the taxing. master, and he (the Vice-Chancellor) had had the same advantage. There waS a case before Vice-Chancellor Wood of " Clark v. Gil" (1 Ray and Johnson, 21), in which the counsel admitted that where the witness did not live in the same town in which he was examnined he might be allowed compensation for loss of time, and ViceChancelor Wood observed that it seemed inconsistent that a country witness coming to town should be allowed compensation for time as well as expenses vhen a town witness was not allowed for time, the probability being that the town witness would lose as much, if not more, by loss of time than the country witness. On that occasion the opinion of Mr. Bance, one of the taxing-masters of the Queen's Bench, was taken, and he stated that tho scale of fees prescribed by the common law judges included compensation for less of time. On looking at that scale it appeared that regard was had to the station of the witness, and whether in town or country, and was varied accordinoly. A professional man in town was allowed one guinea, which would clearly include loss of time, but if he came from& distance two or three gxineas, besides expenses, such sums varying according to whether the witness resided in the town where the case was tried or not. The common law courts therefore, allowed a witness a certain sum, which wjuld be allowed on taxation, and which included loss of time; but that was certain, and did not depend on a particular valuation of time. There was no difference between the right of a vwitness at common law and in e nity and therefore the rule must be that the same scale shIot1d apply. Then as to the question of amount. Mr. Austin lived in the Adelphi, and there would be no travelling expenses; if there were, he would be entitled to them. The scale at c,mmon law, made under the 15th and 16th of Victoria, c 7f, gave a particular allowance to engineers and surveyors (air.Austin beingone), and that was one guineaper day. Mr. Austin attended on the Monday by mistake of the defendants - he was entitled for that day; and again on Tuesday and Wednesday, and was entitled for each of those days. He demanded one guinea for Monday, two for Tuesday, and two for Wednesday, abnd he was wrong in demanding five guineas, but would have been right in asking three. It was said that he had an engagement in the country, where he might have earned a certain sum. It was impossible to say vwhat a party might earn, bat the rule of the old law was that it was for the interests of justice that a vitness must attend, even though he lost by it. The order was therefore right in calling upon him to attend at his own expense, for if a witness attended, refused to be examined, and left without being examined, the other party had a right to call upon him to be examined at his own expense. Mr. Austin was not entitled to anything, therefore, for the last day. As Mr. Austin was partly right and partly wrong, no costs would be given.

Mr. W. MORuIS moved for a sub pn4 dtues teczrm directing the attendance of an officer of the East India Company at the hearing of the above cause, with an original document, which when produced would prove itself. The learned counsel stated that the application was necessarv in consequence of the clerk of records and writs havingreceived a direction from the highest branch of the Court notto issue writs of the nature of that a plied for without an order to ti-at effect from the judge of that branch of the Court before v hom the cause on the hsearing of which the document was re qired to be produced was set down to be heard.
TlioVIOE-CILHACzLLOR said he would not makethe order applied for, because ie thought the motion was founded on a misapprehension. The wvrit should, as it appeared to him, issue erc debiit jutitinf, and if the clerk of records and writs, on being made acquainted with his (the Vice-Chancellor's) view, would not even then issue the writ an application must be made to the Lord Chancellor.
KAY V. CROOK.
This was a bill praying that it might be declared that the plaintiff's father, the testator in the cause, oa the occasion of the plaintii}'s marrige, and in consideration thereof, entered into a cohtract with the plaintiff and his wife to leave to the plaintiff, at the testator's decease, independently of a sum of 3,6000 settled for the plaintiff's benefit on his marriage a share of his property at least equal to the share to be taken by the testator's other children respectively. The
laintiff alleges that the testator by his will and codicil left Eim a share of his property considerably less than that left thereby to the testator's other children, and he supnorts his claim to an equal participation with his brothers and sisters by an endeavour to make out from a long correspondence between himself and the testntor and others, pnor to hii marriage, a contract by the testator to leave to him, independent of and over and above the sum placed in settlement, an equal provision with the testator's children.
The case occupied a portion of Saturday and the whole of to-day, and is not yet cnoxcluaed.

rONVELL V. WVILLiAMS.
This was a motion for an injunction on behalf of th# plaintiffs, who were owners of the Abergwaur Colliery, to restrain ibe defendant, who was lessee of an adjoining colliery, called the Ynyscynnon Colliery, from diverting water from that coliery to the Abergwaur Colliery, and from ermitting certain gutters and holes mentioned in the builteo continue open, and from permitting any water to flow bhrough the same to the Abergwaur Colliery, and from wowlekng *th Ynascynnon Colliery so as designedly or artificially to divert into the plaintiffs' collierywater which ii not to diverted would not flow thither, or from doing ar.y act whereby u ater might be diverted so as to flow into thc Ahergwaur Colliery. It appeared ffiom the bill that a grt at increase o,f water in the Abergwaur Colliery had been caused in October, 1853, by the workings in the Ynyscyn. nen Colliery, upoJn wvhich occasion no proceedings vcwra takern, no further increaseofd water being then anticipated.
In September, 1856, the water in the plaintiffs' colliery had increased to such an extent -s to stop the workings for a week, and the pumping engine which had, before 1853, kept under the water when worked for four hours a-day was in December last compelled to work to the full extent of its power for tho whole 24 hours, in order to keep the water
under. The biD also stated that gutters had been cutin the I YnYscynnon Colliery across the headings, so as to divert the water out of its natural course down to the Abcrgwaur Colliery, and that if such diversion were not stopped the plaintifs' colliery would be inundated and seriously injured.
The case set up by the defendant in opposition to the motion was, that the seam of coal worked in both collieries dipped downwards from the Ynyscynnon to the Abergwaur Colliery, so that the water from the workings of the one nat=ualy flowed towards the workings of the other, and that, under these circumstances, the owners of the Abergwaur Coliery ought to have left a solid bardfer of coal within their own boundary, so as to protect them. selves a*ainst the water flowing down from the upper colliery, instead of which they had worked not only to their own boundar, but beyond it into the boundary of the Ynyscynnon oliery. 'The defendant also stated that, as to the diversion of the water, the regular course had been pursued, which was to turn the water from the main roads into the old workings, and that if the plaintiffs had not worked through the barrier the mischief complained of would not have ensued.
Mr. W. IL J,.rs and Mr. WHITBRE D appeared for the plaintiffs in support of the motion.
Mr. ROLT and Mr. FREELLXG, for the defendant, opposed tLe motion, and relied on " Smith v. Kenrick" (7 Common Bench Reports, 515).
The Vicx.CA-}Ncr.LLox, after observing that there was no dispute of facts, said that it was a proper question for an action at law. The fhrst difficulty occurred in 1853, when the plaintiffs were in a position that a very serious claim was being made by the defendant. They had then chosen to submit to :the increase of water without availing themselves of ,MUirright to try an action of trespass, whereas they had Atito pmp ight and day to keep the water under, and their works were frequently stopped. The whole mischief, howerer, appeared to have been occasioned by the plain-
tiffs' own act, and they had neglected to avail themselves of the opportunity of trying the question in 1853. The better course wvould be to let the motion stand over, with liberty for the plaintiffs t bring such action AS they might be advised, with liberty to apply.

STEVENS V. TIHE MUTUAL SECURITY ASSURANCE COM-
PArxY.
(SUgings in .Baaco, before Lord' and
COLEIRrCE. WIGHTVAN1M. -,nd R1tT .
mr. IAYMOND moved for a rule to show cause why an order made by Air. Justice Coleridge should not be set aside. It appeared that the plaintiff had obtained judgment against the Mutual Security Assurance Society, but, as the judgment was not satisfied, Mr. Justice Coleridge had made an order for execution to issue against the goods of a person named R. Wild, a shareholder of the company. By the deed constituting the company it was prosded that none but assured members who had policies should be share. holders, and they only so long as the policies were at risk. Wild, on the 1st of January, 1855, had effected a policy for the sum of 1,0001. to insure his life against railway accidents during life, for which he paid a preumium of lOs., to be continued annually; and it was provided by the pol
that in case of his death by accident his executors should be entitled to receive the sum of 1,0001., or, in case the accident should not result in death, he should receivo a pro. portionate sum. In the month of September, 1855, he met -with a rallway accident, and put in his claim for compensation, and was allowed the sum of 2001. odd, but nothing was paid. The learned counsel contended that as the policy had ceased to be at risk Wild had ceased to be one of the assured members, and, consequently, was not liable to have execution issued against him.
Lord CAMIPBFiLL said he thought the word " ac^ident" in the policy was slomesn gencralissimum, and included any number of accidents, and that the order was rightly made.
The other judges concurred. Rule refused.

ARGENT V. BENTHALL.
Myr. Serjeaut Parry and MIr. Prentice were counsel for the plaiuntiff, and Mr. Johnston Neale and Mr. Cook Evans for the defendant,
This was an action brought by the plaintiff to recover two years' wag,es for her services as barmaid at the Canterbury Arms Tavern, at Woolwich. It appeared that a man named Hare had been the tenant of the tavern. In 1854 Hare assiigned all his property to the defendant, as trustee for Hare's creditors. The plaintiff had been in the service of Hare, and the defendant coutinued her there under a written agreement, by which she was to receive 161. per annum. She continued in the service for two years. The plaintiff stated that she had frequently asked the defendant for her wages, and he had fromised to pay her, but had not done so; and she denied aving left the service with a view of getting another place, but she admitted that upon two or three occasions she had been absent on accomunt of illness, and upon one occasion she vwas away for three weeks, without having first asked the de. fendant's permission. There were now two years' wages due to her.
T-he defence was that the defendant had originally told the plaintiff that she was to look to Hlare for uaysnent of her wages, and the defendant swore that the plaintiff had never asked him for any wages, and that he had never promised to pay her any wages, but that he had at times given her a small gratuity. Since the action was brought he had seen the plaintiff and asked her how she could be so wicked as to brng this ction against him when she knew he did not ore her anything, and when he had been so kindto her. She said it was not her doig, but her lawyer's. He said he would rather give her 101. as a present than spend it in law. She said she would accept it, and made an appointment to go to his house the next morning to receive it, and she asked him to give her the raU way fare to London, and he gave her ls., although 8d. was her fare. The plaintiff did not, however, caU upon him.
James Palmer, a builder, of Cannon-row, Westminster and one of Hare's creditors, stated that at the time of the asEignment ie heard the defendant tell the plaintiff that she was to receive her wages from Hare, whose servant she was to consider herself, and that rhe agreement was a mere form. In October last the plaintiff asked witness where she could see Hare about her wages; he told her it was of no use seeing Hare, as he had nothing, but as soon as the business was sold she would get her wages, and he remarked that he believed it was usual for servants to be paid in full, and he would vote, as a creditor, for her being paid in full; and he requested her to tell him what was the amount due to her. She said 151. or 161., and he said he would put it down 171., and she thanked him. She never told him that the defendant was indebted to her for wages. After that she entered into his service so long as he continued to hold
bIr.ae was present when she was told that the assignment was prepared merely to protect him, and she was to remain, upon the same terms, as his servant. He had a book of the amount of her wages, but that book was burnt in a fire that took place on the premises. He had not paid her an bing on account of wages due after the assignment. She left hini in September, 1855, and stated that she had a situation at Leicester to manage some spirit vaults of which her cousin was the proprietor. He in consequence engaged another person in her place. She took away all her clothes at that tine. After being absent five or six weeks she wrote to hima to say she was not so comfortable as she expecedm, and she came back again.
Mr. Justice CRworusroz said that the business was Bentball's, out of which the wages were to have come.
Ellen Willianis was at Hare's in September, 1855. The launtiffsaid she was going to Leicester to take a situation.

This was an action tried before the Lord Chief Justice at the sittings after lst term at the Guildhall, when a. verdict was found for the plaintiff.
Mr. Serjeant SIME now moved for a rule for a nxew trial and some points reserved. The action was brought for the non-de'ivery of a cargo of coals within a reasonable time, whereby the plaintiff lost his market and suffered other damages. It was alleged that when the cargo was shinped on board the defendant's vessel at Hartlepool the vessel was not seaworthy, within the captain's know ledge. The vessel encountered bad weather on the voyage, and had to put into Grimnsby, where the cargo was unloaded and the vessel detained for repairs some time. This cargo was insured, hut the underwvriters refused to pay on the policy, on the ground of the unseaworthiness of the ship, and the action was therefore brought against the owner.

The action vas brought for the non-delivery within a reasonable tinie of a quantity of cheese sent by the defendant's railway from Bath to Bishopstowe, whereby the market was missed and some of the cheese spoilt. The question raisedwas whether the cheese had been delivered to the defendants to carry as comnmon carriers, or uinder a special contract. A special contract baving been given in evidence, it was alleged that the plaintiff ought to have declared upon it, and not on the defendants' common law liability as commuon carriers.

MIr. Serjeant THOMAS, who appeared-for the defendant, after a short struggle for costs, agreed to postpone the case until after term.
Mr. Baron BBAMWELL said that the result of these London sittings was that parties and witpesses were brought here at considerable expense only to be sent back again without having their causes tried. If the Court would sit on from day to day until the list was exhausted, then their attendance would not be entirely thrown away. It was net as if they had only London causes to try, for the last cause might have been tried at Westminster just as well as here. In his opiniJn, the sittings in London in term were a posi tive disadvantage to the public, aad when he was practisine he found it a great inconvenience to the bar. He trustedl that it wyouldbe altered some day.
HAr,MAR V. RENNISON.
Mr. Gates appeared for the plaintiff and Mr. Temple for the defendant.
This was an action brought to recover a sum of 401., aleged to be due to the plaintiff from the defendant as the balance of an account. The defendant pleaded payment.
The plaintiff was a distiUer in London, and the defendant was a spirit merchant at Hull. The defendant, in endeavouring to support his plea of payment, swore that he had paid the plaintiff's traveller the sum now claimed, and he produced a piece of paper on which was an account drawn up by the traveller of the sums due to the plaintiff. A sum of 401. was deducted from the total, which sum the defendant stated he paid at that time to the traveller, together with a further sum of 201., for which a stamped receipt was given on the same piece of paper.
The plaintiff's case, as proved by his traveller, was that the defendant, havig some time previously paid a sum of 40l. to the plaintiff, had received an acknowledgment for thatsum. Onthetraveller drawin 'up the account between the parties the defendant said that he had paid 401. since the last account had been made out, and begged him to deduct that sum from the account, at the same time showing him the acknowledgment which he had received from the plaintiff. The traveller who had already allowed that 401. m the account, did not look at the date, but deducted the amount, as appeared upon the piece of paper, and gave a receipt for the 201., which was the only sum he received from the defendant.

IN E B EROYAL BIILSmBkNK.
f o C
(Before MIr. ¢otmwot52ner HoI.RoyD.
This was an adjourned hearing of the opposition of certain new shareholders,that they might be ailowed to prova against the estate for all moneys paid on account of their shame
Mr. Joeeph Browne, Instructed by 3Mr. Linldater, appeared for the assignees; Mr. Mellish, instructed by Messra Sharpe, Field, and Jackson, appeared for the shareholders.
Mr. Joseph Marsh, examined, said ho was a commander in the navy. In 1852 he saw advertisements in the papers of the toyal British Bank offering advantages. At the end of 1852 he saw Mr. Cameron at the bank. Mr. Cameron said he could not select a bettor security for his money, and. he gave him all the reports of the bank published up to that time. The reports in his hand were the copies received from M1r. Cameron. Mr. Cameron produced the charter of the company, and Mr. Paddeson, the secretary, read it, and it was stated that he could not, under the terms of the charter, lose more than one-fourth of his capital.
The clause in the charter referred to, and which has been so often published, having been read,
Mr. Mrsh said, that he thought there was a protection in the charter. He shortly after this interview (about June, 1853) deposited 8001. in the bank, which was to be applied to the purchase of shares, and by December, 1853, he had made up the amount 1,0001., thus completing the sum necessary for the purchase of 20 shares. He had sub. sequently received Tarious reports of the bank. The first report was dated the 1st of February, 1855, and a new charter was obtained on the 23d of February, 1855. Ee had subsequently to this signed the deeds of the company as a shareholder. When he had signed " the parchment thing" sent to him, he received the certificate produced of his being the holder of the 20 shares. He continued to receive the reports up to the time of the failure. The reports were enclosed in large envelopes, to which were affixed seals of great magnitude. But for those reports he would not have permitted
himself to be robbed and plundered by the directors. He, could not but thus express himself, as he 'felt that hq had been grievously robbed. He was present at a meeting on the 4th of September, 1856, when various directors wer0 present, and Mr. Coleman had made a report of the position of the bank. Had not received a copy of that report. Considering the rascally manner in which he had been swindled he felt that he was entitled to one. He had seen in Tihe Times a very accurate report of Mr. Coleman's remarks and reports. The report of 2%e Zimes was substantially correct, so far as it went. There was not a word in the report that was not true. What passed had made au impression upon his mind that he could never
fZ. BRO%V,E objected to this as evidence.
Mr. MunrsHs said, if any difficulty were thrown in the way, the effect wrould only be to have the same evidence given by the reporter of The imes, vwho would be sub. pcenaed to produce his notes. HXe considered all that paesed atathaitmteetingmight be received asanadmission against
The Com3wssioim thought that to make it evidence Mr. Coleman must be examined.
Mr. Marsh said, Mr. Esdaile had assented to M1r. Coleman's report, and said he was sorry that they had been grievously wronged.
Mr. BROWNZ called upon Mr. Mellish to state the par. ticular portions of the reports upon wbich he relied.
Mr. James Edward Coleman said he was an accountant. In September last he was employed by the directors to make up a statement of the affairs of the bank from its commencement to its stoppage. btr. Stapleton and MIr. Kennedv were the directors woo first gave him instructions.
Mr. MELL}sn having put in the minutes of the meeting of directors authorizing Mr. Coleman to prepare his report,
Mr. Coleman stated that the figures in a bankiDng almanao comprised a correct statement of his report. The whole of the part of the report that referred to the property and general assets of the bank was prepared by himseli He depended upon his clerks in the preparation of some parts of the accounts, but he tested the accuracy of those parts. It was from his statement of the debtors to the bank that the official assignee was now collecting assets.
Mr. Bno)vNE said, he would not resist the evidence contained in Mr. Coleman's statement on the ground that part of it was prepared by his clerks, but he must have time to examine its accuracy.
Mr. Coleman, in continuation, said, his valuation of the assets of thebank vwas "within the mark," rather thau otherwise, ie., it was made on a low scale, Had attended a meeting of directors and others at the London Tavern on the 20th December, 1856, and made the statement contained in the daily papers.
Ir. MXLrsH said, the directors had admitted the accuracy of Mr. Coleman's statements.
m.r. Coleman's examination continued.-Had inspected the previous report of the directors from the commencement of the bank. Had no doubt those reports were incorrect, but was not prepared to say the extent of the inaccuracy. His (Mr. Coleman's) reports now would be somewhat different to those of September, 1856. The value of assets changed from time to time.
Mr. BnOWv:E submitted that Mr. Mellish must point out the specific misrepresentations in the reports of the directors upon which he reled.
- Mr. Mriarg referred to a statement that the debts and liabilities of the bhnk were 540,0001., and the manner in which Mr. Coleman had endeavoured to account for the losses (270,0001.) from time to time. The first loss of 13,6404 by a director had occurred between 1850 and 1855 the said director having retired in 185L The next loss by;a director (MacGregor, M.P) of 7,3621. had occurred at the time stated. The loss by lumphrey Brown, M.P., a director, joined with three otherparties, had been 70,8091.; the loss by Oliver, of Liverpool, was 13,8001.; by Cameron, the manager of the bank, 29, 902. Altogether the amount lost by directors and offtcers of the bank had been 123,0001., and the difference between that sum and 270,0001. (the total losses) had been made as stated.
Mr. Mxauss said, the directors had admitted the accuracy of Mr. Coleman's statements in September and De. cember last. Mr. Coleman had stated that the directors should never have made a dividend at all. He came to this conclusion from dissecting theprofit and loss account.
Mr. Coleman. further examined, adhered to this state. ment. Interest, for instance, had been charged and taken credit for on account of the Cefn Ironworks and Oliver's account after he had failed. The assets included "good bills"-some of thesebils being due as far backas 1850. The writing off of bad debts had amounted altogether to a sum of between 4,0001. and 5,0001. He could not state the amount of bad debts that ought to have been written off, It was something considerable. Had rather not make an attempt to state the amount. Ina report published by the directors in reference to the bank having assets to the amount of upwards of 800,0001. there were errors.
Mr. George And.-on, examined, said he was a clerk in the Royal British Bank thrrs Pears and a-half. He kept a book of past due bils. The book produced contained a summary of those bils up to February 9, 1855; the total amount of past due bills at the head office was 101,6921. None of these bills had been vritten off as bad. They ex. tended from 1850 to February, 1855. With , little trouble he could ascrtain, the amount in each year from 1850 to
Mfr. MELLSH said, Mr. Browrne P referred cross-examrining the witnesses after the whole of the depositions had been given, and it would be convenient if an adjournment were
Mr. BROwNiE suggested that, before the adjournment took place, he should have specific particulars of the misrepre. sentastin relied on.
.i LIMl undertook to furnish the required par. ticulsrs
Mr. BitoWmE said, there were three cases pending before three superior courts (Chancery and common law) so far analogous to the present that it might be desirable to have a decision in one or more of them before the present inquiry should be resumed. He suggested an adjournment for a fortnight with this view.
The Coseansssoaim observed that he would grant the adjournment on the understanding that the pending claims were not to be allowed in any way to interfere with any dividend in the meantime.
Mr. Ia &T.ER said, Mr. Field was prepared to give this undertaking. Mr. Field had hada fall run of the bank premises in order to obtain any information he might require.
The COam3nssioNER observed that the petitioners had some very up-hill work before them, and that it would require much more evidence than that already given to establish their claim. How could the fact, if established, of their having been deceived by the reports referred to get rid of their liabiity to third parties 7
Mr. MIELLISH would at present confine himself to their right to have refunded the money pd for their shares, The question, however, arose, if his onour had a very strong opinion upon the case, whether it might not be desirable to avoid further expense, nad be in a position the swoner to
apWa to the L.orda Justices ?
eCoMMessCxmoN thought that mere general allegations, showing gross mismanagement, and misstatements to the public generally, would not suffice to sustain the case of
th e ptition-ers,
eiBSOWNE doubted whether it could be shown that the directors had wilfully misrepresented the position of the bank. It might be that they had been deceived as well as the shareholders.
His HO?NOU said, as far as the case had gone, he held a very strong opinion, and it would require much further. evidence to strengthen the case of tbe petitioners. He would, however, order an adjournment on the condition already mentioned.
Adjourned accordingly.

(Before the CH, v t - i
nums solvent, a clergyman of the established church, applied to be discharged from prison, where he had been confinedl since the 15th of February last. His total debts amOunted tO 4,20., for 9201. of 'which he had received no coneidemation.
Mr. Dowse opposed for Mr. Baily, and several creditors slpgared in person.
upon examination the Insolvent admitted that he peti titioned as an insolvent debtor in 1853, when he was a prisoner in York Castle. That fact was omitted from the present schedule. He did not file any schedule under that petition, as the debt of his detaining creditor was settled by a lady since deceased, but to whom he was engaged to be married. In 1850 he was curate of St. licholas, Warwick, and while there he borrowed 501. of Wr. Daily, of which he had sincere *d 15. At the time he borrowed that money he owe=ver debts, and there wcre several judgments agamist him. He was dismissed from.that curacy because some of his creditors memorialized the bishop, and xLade him acquainted with his embarrassments. He then 'went as curate to Costock, Notts, and thence removed to Keyingham, near HulL In June, 1853, he came to Tondon, and oco sonaly officiated at various places of worshi1p, after which he went to Goadby, Leicestershire.

The learned CoNxssissuozn was of opinion that the facts dlid not hear out the came
Mr. Mason, an attorney, who had conducted the insolvent's proceedings at York, submitted that the description was incomplete, as there was no mention of York Castle among the insolvent's residences, although it was in that place is (Mr. Mfason's) debt was incurred.
In reply to questions from this creditor, the insolvent said, that in London eh had written articles for newspapers and magazines. He had written pamphlets, one of which was entitled Can a .Teu, sit in Parliament ; and if not, why not I On account of -that pamphlet he had received 150 guineas from Mlr. D. Salomons.
Mtr. Mnson.-And how much from Baron Rothschild ? Insolvent.-Nothing. That is for the future.
At a subsequent stage the insolvent desired to ask some questions of Mr. Mason which he thought would have some beanng upon the question of character.
Insolvent.-Did you ever officiate in the pulpit of a church of England because a client of yours had been arrested and taken to York Castle ?
Mr. Mason.-I decline to answer.
Did you not put on the bands and gown of a minister, and in them ascend the pulpit and then read to the congregation a written sermon ?
Mr. Mason.-I decline to answer.
Did you not go the Archbishop of York and confess what you had done?
Mr. Maesn.-I have already said I decline to answer.
Insolvent.-Then, your Honour, I think, if a man could eguilty of such conduct in the house of God, I may look n1iktvcolacency upon any opposition he may attempt to
The C}Er CostrwssiONE.-He is not the first of the profession who has done such a thing.
Mr. Simpson, of Tottenham-court.road, a creditor for 611, for furniture supplied im January, 1856.-The insolvent stated on incurring the debt that he was prosecuting a suit in the ecclesiastcal court against his wife, who bad eloped from him, and that he was advised he must prepare some kind of a home to receive her if her prayer for a restitution of conjugal rights should be granted. Upon that statement, and upon ascertaining that the wife's father was a gentleman of substance, the gpods were supplied; but within a very few days they were seized under an execution at the sut of Messrs. Howitt, upholsterers, of Holborn.
The insolvent said, Messrs. Iowitt's debt was 281. for furniture supplied m 1854. They had promised not to seize upon his goods, but did not adhere to their undertaking.
Mr. Lyon, a musical instrument dealer, complained that in June, 18, the insolvent ordered of him a narmonium, price 10 guineas, to be used in the Sunday-school atGoadby and for the payment ofwhich subscriptions were being raised in the parish. He, however, undertook a personal responsibilty and ws to pay within six months, referring to the Rev. Mr. Gilbert for testimony to his character. The creditor, after seeing Mt. Gilbert, was satisfied, and sent the instrument, on account of which only 11. uls. had been paid.
The insolvent said, th'harmonium was sold with other articles under a bll of sale which he had given to a creditor at Leicester. He was desirous of omitting the harmonium from the bill of sale as it had not been paid for but the creditor said it must be inserted
The Insolvent then produced a letter written to himnself whie in pron by Mr. Lyon, in which the creditor announcedhis intention of opposing if his debt were not paid or security given
The CmEv COESSIMOsRN.-Wel, what then? He had a right to do so.
No other creditor appeared, and the insolvent having no witnesses to call,
The learned Co5misroNnm said, the case could not be concluded at once, as the schedule required amendment by the insertion of York Castle among the places of residence. There were two cases proved against the insolvent of debts incurred without means or expectation of payment. Mr. Simpson's debt had been most wantonly contracted at;a time when the insolvent was not onlv wiLthout means, but was aware of the jeopardy in which the goods supplied were placed by the existence of an execution at Messrs. Howitt's suit. Mr. Lyon's debt, too, although small, had been improperly incurred. If the instrument was to have been paid
for oythe subecriptions of the parishioners the insolvent ought to have waited until those subscriptions were paid, and not have made himself personally liable,
The cns'e was then adjourned until the 9th of February f or amendments to the schedule.

POLICE.
MANSION.ssOUSs.-Mr. Hodgson, the superintendent of the city police, attended, at the request of the LoRD MAYos, upon the subject of somae public meetings of artisans which have recently been held in Smithfield.
The LoRD IYoi said he had been given to understand thata report was prevalent that he had sanctioned the bolding of the meetings. He had never given any permission for their beinz held, nor had he sanctioned them in any way, and nothing could be farther from his thoughts than doing so. He, at the same time, had no means of prevent ing meetings being held at Smithfidld so long as they were properly conducted and did not cause inconvenience to the pubue. He was desirous of learning from Mr. Hodgson of what class of persons they consisted.
Mr. Hodgson.-They are very orderly,weUlconducted persons, and are generally what they represent themselves to bei they are principally mechanics and others engaged in industrial pursuits, stone-masons, and bricklavers.
The LOBD MAYOR.-Is there a large number of this cLass out of employment at the present time ?
Mr. Hodgson.-There is. Their obiect in meeting is to impress upon the unions the necessity of relieving all persons out of employment. They intend to applyat the unions for
The Lo"n MAYor.-If a man cannot get employment and is destitute he must go to the union and receive relief, bat from what I know of theworldng classes of this country -a most =espectablebody-I am satisfied that they will conduct themselves orderly and peaceably, and there can be no doubt that their wants wil be attended to.
Mr. Hodgson.-The spot on which they meet is actually beyond the bounds of the city. We are only desirous of preventing public inconvenience, and doubtless sour Lordship's statement6 when it goes forth to the public, will have the effect of removing the impression, which is very general, that the meetings are held under your sanction.
The LoRD M&YoR.-I cannot imagine how such an impression ever got abroad.
Mr. Hodgson.-I believe that one of the orators publicly made the statement.
The subject then dropped.
GVflrssL.-MiellMe&gher, a respectably-dressed young man, described in the charge-sheet as a soldier attached to the Warley-barracks at Brentwood, was charged with obtaining seven shawls, value 321. 1s., of Messrs. Kerr and Scott, warehousemen, of 58, Cannon-street west, by means of a forged order.
Mr. Xilner said he was manager in the establishment of Messrs. Kerr and Scott, wholesale warehousemen of Cannon-street west. On Thursday last his firm received a letter purporting to come from Messr-. Smeaton ar.d Co., drapers, of Leeds, stating that Mr. J. EL Moor, their traveller, would cal upn aessrs. Kerr and Scott, and recommending them todobusiness with him if possible. Witness saw the prisoner on Friday when he called, but did not supply himi with the goods.
Mr. John Patten said the prisoner came to the warehouse on Friday and was introduced to witness by Mr. Forster, who told him to show the prisoner the goods he required. He accordingly took him into the shawl department, and thepriner sdected seven shawls, value 32& 10s., which he drected to be sent to Paul's Coffeehouse, to be conveyed to Leeds by a person who would take them free of charge. Other goods which be sdected were to be sent direct to
lessrs. Smeaton, at Ieeds, and some were to be directed to himselfu a t P aul's Coffeehouse. The seven shawls were
psakdupand entas directed.
ir. Kner said, on Saturday, in consequence of some suspiions entertained by the firm, they telegraphed to leeds, and received a reply from Messrs Smeaton denying al knowledge of any person named Moor, or that they had authorized any person to order the goods in question on their account.
Ric.ards, the officer, said hbe hahd no further evidence at Present to offer in this case, but there was another charge against the prisoner.
Mr. eraury, of the firm of Bradbure,Gwenthe and Beali, of Aldermanbury, maidhe receiveda letter purport. ing t com fro thesamepersns as in the last case at leeds; hut, in consequence of 00oinstion. he received from Messas.

Mr. Bradbury pro-- ceeded to look for the order, and in his absence the prisoner made some excuse to get away, and was leaving the premises when he was detained by Mr. Beall.
Mr. Beall said, as soon as he heard the prisoner say he came frcm Kerr and Scott he left his desk, when the pri-

Richard after taking the prisoner into custody, sharched him, and found 13 duplcates of goods in pledge, some letters, and memorandav among which were a elet of wholesae warehousemen in the city, and an unopened letter addressed to Sir James aelville. There was also a furlough paper made out in the namo of Bit BX. Moeagher, lance orporal in the Hon. East IndiarCom Service.
Alderman Wreq e directed the officer to LUe theoletter to Sir James o elv wie, and inform him of the manner in which it cane into his posession.
The prisoner seemed very much annoyed that the letter should be forwarddo , and sad he did not wish to disgrace his friends.
The prisoner was then remanded, and as he was leaving the doc na gentleman from the frm of Bevington and iorris came forward and sad he had a charge of a siiiadlar character against the prisoner.
We ar requested by Sir sil W. CAonDEN to correct an erroneous impression which apeaed in our report of the Samaritan Institution inqur othre him on Saturday last. The worthy Alderman sated that he adjourned the case to that day, at 12 o'clock, subject to the ordintay business of the courte but, as there wa an unusually long list of prisoner although he sAt at a much earlier hour to dispose of the night charges firt, he was unavoidably detained on the bench in the justice room until late in the aftemoon. By our report, which was necessarily condensed, it appeared that the ta giate appointed a certain hour to hear the csse, and didpno arrive to do so until some hours after, leaving it to be inferred that the delay was occasioned by his being detained on private business when, in fact, he was occupied the whole of the time in his public duties.

She put her hand down, and found the hand of a woman who was close to her in her pocket. The woman drew out her purse, nd immefdiately banded it ver to the prisoner, saying "*Take it." The prisoner did take the purse from the woman, and then made his way into the body of the church. Witness kept her eby on the prisoner, and, having made her loss known, gave him into custdy.

about 18, of soulen appearntance, w charged with an assault upon his mother.
At the first examination, on-the 8th inst., the mother, who was in a state of perfect exhaustion from loss of blood and illness, stated,-I was at home Lias night sitting by the fire, when the prisoner.came in and mmediately began to rake out the fire. As that waspabl the fuel I had I asked him not to do no, and heinstantly struckt me twice upon the head with the poker. I fell to the ground perfect senseless, and he did not asst me event tn, I lieve, fo r when I recovered I founa mgself stl upon the ground and I therefore first went to t tation-house toh c hae, in charge, and next to the hospital, ef which am .nlow a patient.
Hoare, 178 N.-The compolainant came to mie at the station-house in the most pitiable stte, bleeding profubsely fromathe head, and begged protection. Sbe said her son had illused her, and I thereforeaccmpanied her to Dinahbuidings, Artillery-lane,cwhere, in a room on the ground floor, I found a large pool of blood b the fireplace, andL the
risoner sitti ithere. He didnot eny thecharge,andon

The mothe then gothso faintiandexhaurted that I was obliged to take her at once to the hospital, from which, in spite of remonstrance, she would come up this morning to give evidence against the prisotier.
Tihel mother was then orDered by the magistrate to be taken from the court in a cab, and the prisoner, who was stated by the police to have been three times charged at the Mansion-bouse and twice at this court with assaults upon his mother, and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment for them, was remanded for a week, with directions for the medical officer of the House of Detention to examine him, a doubt being entertained of his mental capacitym
On the case being now called en, Mr. Robert DesbebaT, house-sugeon of the London Hospital, stated,-The woman was brought to us on the night of the 8th inst. with her head bruiseld and swollen and two wounds on the right side of it, which at the time displayed very dangerous indications. She gradually improved, an,d is now goang on well; the poker produced by the porce iso wel caelated to inflict such wounds.

The imother positively contradicted this, and, all doubt as to the prisoner being in perfect Possession of his faculties being removed by the report from the prison, the depositions were taken, and he was fully commiitted for trial.

ILALVsLs.Jane Groves, a fasahonably-drossed young woman, who has been in custody since Saturday week on a charge of being concerned,mwith another woman not in custody, in robbimg a ldy named Fagg of a porte-monnaie containg half a-sovereign and some suver, on the platform at the Crystal Palace Railway station, was put to the bar.
It will bO recollected from tho evidence before given that on Saturday week the prosecutrix (Mmrs Fg), accompanied by her little boy and her nephew, had been to visit the poultry sbow at the Orystal Elac and when leaving a remale companion of the prisoner pushed' rudely against her on the railway platform. Mm Fagg made room for this peron to pass, but, instead of doing so, she pushed against her a second time, pd on the instant sbe observed this person draw her hanld*om her pocket, and her portemonnaie in it. She instantly charged her with taking her purse, and at the moment sWher pass the porte-monnaie to the prisoner. Witness in conee queneo id hold of the prisoner, but she managed to get away, and vaz subsequently pointed out to an efficer in A zecond-class carriage of a train about to start as one of the iieves. The missingpur wa
not found on her2 but in her hand Ws found, with other silver, a bright liorn, 6 simlar coin having been among the silver in the stole purse. On a search being made the purse was found under a carriage close to where the robbery had been committed, with, singular to say, the half-sovereign in it.
In addition to the evidenco before given, Sergeant Carpenter, of the R division of police, and who is principally
employed on the Drigbton Railway, said he knew the jriloner vel, nd knew her to be the companion of notorious pickpockets and thieves, and he had every reason to beheve ae had been living wtha n ranted Devonshire, who is at present inprison,andundergoing a sentence of six months Ur picking pockets.
Police-constable Patrickj Lyons, 291 B, deposed that last Saturday fortnight le took two men out of a third. cln foscrA at the New Croess station of the North Kent line for pickingpockets, and he at that time-saw theprisoner in the same carriage with them. He also subsequently saw her and another woman at the Greenwich police-court on the day onwhich the swo men had been examined and sentenced to six maonths' imprisonment. Tfhe prisoner on that ocsion asked him about the case of one of them (Devon. shire), and she and the other woman were in the company of the solicitor who defendedl the men.
d r. Solomons, who attended for the prisoner, subjacted Mrs. Fagg and the other witnesss to a severe cross-examination, and also addressed the magistrate on the prischerxs behalf, urging that much of whatt en ofcers had atated was but mere "he y" evidence, and be therefore hoped his Worship would not act upon it, but give his client the benefit of the doubt.
Mr. ELLIOTT was about to commit tho prisoner for trial, when Mrs Fag said that her attendance at the sessions to proecute woul beattended with considerable inconvenience to her, and she therefore hoped the magistrate would dea summarily with the ease.

THE NEW STEAM BATTERY.-The great iron war
THE Nxw STrA BA7T=Ry.-The great iron war steamer, which is now in construction at lioboken for the Government, being an object of much interest, we have been at considerable pains to collect reliable information in regard to her, principally through the medium of our Washington correspondents; and, as it differs very materially from the statements recently made in various quarters, we give it to our readers. In 1842 the late Mr. Robert L Stevens first broached to the Government the subject of harboturdefence by means of steam batteries of iron, which should be shot and shel proof, and in 1843 Congress, by a
spcal act, directed that the Navy Department should contract with him for such a vesseL In 1844 a contrat was accordingly made with him by Mr. Mason, tben Seeretary of the avy, under which Mr. Stevens commenced collecting materials andconstructing the dry dock in which the vessel is now building. Mr. Stevens bound himself by this contract to construct a war steamer suitable for use in the waters of New York, from Sandy Hook upward. It was sti ulat-ed that she should be built of iron, that she should be shcot and shell proof against ordnance tben in use on ships of war, that she should have four engines. and be propeUed by a submersed propeller which should give great . eed. Her dimensions were to be not less than 250 feet i length and 40 feet beam, and hercost complete, including an armament of not less than six heavy guns, was not to exceed $587, 000.
For the faithful fulfilment of this contract the Government. required and received from Mr. Stevens amaple security, as itwasfurtherstpulated that payments shouladbe)nse to bim as he proceeded with the construction up to $5C0 000,
end that the remaining $87,000 should be paid when thIe ship was completed and received. Mr. Stevens enooutereho many. diffculties in makirifizhis preliminary arrasgements, aLnd it was not until July,14, thlat the actual conistruction was commienced. Meantime he ba decided, after moare fully studying the subject, to incrase the dimensions of the vessel very much. Ihntead of a length of 250 ffett she is nxearly 420 feet long, and her other dimensions are inmtosste
in proportion. lIstead of four eng.ins and Oiie propeller, Ash has eight engines anid two propellers. Her boilers a6re lO in number, of large d'imensions, and hernfower will be nearly e Qu1 to 900 horses The vessel is in a vel y aavsLnceds ate, and t o nmachinery, and boilers, and dependencies are all complete and in place Owing tobrral
increased dimensions beyond those sti ulatedfoin ecy tract the cost will be mnuch incr=aeJ but how much we are not able to state. The pamets bv the Govera4ment eannot exceedI $500,000 util the vese is delivered and received, unleas Congress should make further appropriations, Since the construction was commenced the original projector, Mlr. R~obert L. Stevenis, has died, but, it is- stated that his brother, Mr. E. A. StVens, Is determiined to comnplete the vesel ; that a good force is nowr at work, under the amegeneal upevisin wichhas been employcd! fromthe ommecemet. M.

Manchester Commercial Association.-The
AIANt-11ESTER COMMERCIAL ASsoCIATION. -The annual meeting of this association was held at Manchester yesterday, Mr. J. A. Turner presiding. The Chairman, in commenting upon the annual report, referred to the proud position which this country held during the negotiations for the conclusion of peace last year. He believed we might look back with satisfaction to the course of trade since peace was established, for at no period in the annals of our conmnerce had any approach been made to the amount of business carried on. Our exports had exceeded those of any other period by 20, 000,0001., for they amounted to the enormous sum of 115,000,000l., and he believed that while the mereantile interests had been flourishing, the popuiation of the country had been well employed, thatgene. rally contentment had prevailed, and that we might on the whole consider ourselves in a very prosperous condition. But there was one cloud in the distance, and that was the probable distress we were likely to experience before long from the inadequate supply of the raw material which gave employment to such vast numbers of the inhabitants of tbis district. (Hear.) In 10 years, from 1847 to 1850, the imports of cotton into this country had exactly doubled, for in 1847 they were 1,234,000 bales, while in 1850 they were 2,467,003 bales; but such had been the progress of the cotton trade that whereas at the end of 1847 the stock in Liverpool was 451,000 bales, or 20 weeks' consumption, at the end of 1SJ6 the stock was only 332,000 bales, or eight weens' consump. tion. That was the total stock at the end of a year which gave an Anmerican crop of 3,500,000 bales, and all authentic aceounts pretty nearly concurred in the anticipation that there would only be 3,000,000 bales to meet tche requirements of the present year. We might depend upon it that we should be the sufibrers by the deficiency, for it was rather startlng to know that the United S3tates and the Continent were noiv, unitedly, using about as much cotton as Great Britain, In looking back, again, on the past year, there was one cause for feeligS of humUliation among commercial society in the noumerous crimes, frauds, and ihfaniies that had taken place in the year liSfi. (Hear, hear.) In conclusion, he referred in terms of deep regret to the death of Alr. Brotherton, wbose loss would be especially felt by all who had had occasioii to communicate wvith the representatives of that conmunity. (Applause.) On the mot!on of Sir J. Potter, seconded by Mr. M. Ross, the report was unanimously received. The proceedinigs concluded with the appointmieut of directors and auditors and a vote of thanks to the directors of the past year.
TilE BOOT AND SHOE TRADE.-Last iight a large meeting of master boot and shoe makers in the metropolis, including many of the principal niembers of the trade, wvas held at the Freemasons Tavern, with the view of adopting soane common course of action to accommodate their interests to the unprecedented rise in the price of leather of late, and especiaUy witiin the last six weeks. Mir. Medwin, of Regent's-quadrant, acted as chairman and from the statements that he and the several other speakers made to the nieeting it appears that from a variety of concurrent causes the price of leather is from o0 to S0 per cent., many estimatirg it at even a higher figure than that, more than it was a year ago, This is not confined to London, bLt is general throughout the wvhole country. Not wishing to run the risk of losing old customers by making a corresponding increase in the price of boots and shoes, the masters during the last year have struggled on at the old prices, hoping that the rise was only temporary and exceptional, but they have done so in many cases 'vithout deriving a farthing of profit on the whole transactions for the 12 months, and in others by sustaihing heavy losses. The case of oxie well-known tradesman wvas cited, who paid a rent of 4001. a-year for his premises, and who estimnated the whole of the prolits on his trade for the last year at only 801., and that wvithout taking into account his necessary household expenses. This state of things, it was stated, has becomre so serious to the trade that the members of it have been driven to bring the matter under public consideration with the view of justifying them in maaking an equivalent advance in the prices of boots and shoes of all kiuds, inot for the purpose of obtaining greater profits, which they repudiate, but simiply as a ineasure of necessasry protection and justice to thewselves as a body. The scarcity and consequent hiihs cost of leather are chiefly attributed by the trade to the enorumious consumnption of thearticlo during the war, when at the same time no raw hides were imported into this country from St
Petersburg; to the greatly increased quantities of leather now being exported to the United States; to the murTain among cattle in SoUtli America, whence we have been accustomed to derive large supplies of raw hides; to the exportation of boots and shoes in incredibly lari;e quantities to the Australian colonies since the gold discovery; and to a decrease in the supply of leather we have heretofore received from France, resulting from the extensive substitution of leather for wooden shoes among the lower classes in the French provinces. The mneeting entirely repudiated the idea of anything like a combination among themselves .or the trade of which they are members for the purpose of fow,ing a riseof prices on the public. Besidee the clairman $j3e iBeeting was addressed by Mr. Simpson, of Tottenhiam. c, turoad; Mr. Bloore, of the firm of Berrall and Co., REar y4<elane; Mr. Bird, Oxford-street; Mr, Green, Shoredite. MeEsrs. Cornell, Hewitt, Hooker, and others; and eventea a res°olution was passed by acclamation recommending the, aidoption by the trade of an average advanee in the price o, boots and shoes iii proportion tothe rise in the price of leather Other resolutions were also adopted for givir.g effect to the wishee of the meeting, and the proceeding4 tvrsidnated,
Ragged Schools.
RAGGED SCHOOLS.. . ,
TO TE1E EDITOR OF THFE TIMES.
Sir,-TheBritish are essentiaiIy a practical people. They care less for theories, however beautiful when measured by rule and line, than for the result of plans 'when in working operation. Eenoe it is that, while philosophers and statesmen have indulged in sheer talk about the causes and best modes of repressing crime, and have done but little to curtail its hideous proportions save by penal laws-earnestminded men and women have endeavoured to dam up the very springs of crime by educating, industrially and religiously, theoffspring of our crfriinal population.
It is now abont 15 years since ILagged Schools were opened in the very midst of the dens of the " Devil's Acre," Fieldlane, and St. Giles's. At first the pseudo-wise sneered at the project; while others, from the outtr6 attire and outrageous conduct of the strange beings thus congregated, visited the schools simply because they were novel "lions" of the modern Babylon. Bat efforts whichoriginatedinpious enthusiasm became systematized and regulated as men of reflection gave mature thought to the subject; and now, within a radius of five miles of St. Paul's, there are about 150 of these valuable institutions. They inclade nearly 20,000 scholars; 3,244 of whom are more or less industriously trained. Very many of these are homeless orphans; some are outcasts rescued from haunts of infamy; and others are the offspring of those who prefer decorating the gin-palace to training their children to perform their share of this world's work.
But are there any results of this vast machinery, seeing that sufficient time has elapsed to test the value of the experiment; or do ragged schools supply another proof that the vice of great cities is beyond the control of Christian philanthropy 9 Facts, many and obvious, testify that the founders have not laboured in vain, and indicate that if these institutions had not from the very first been crippled in ftunds their influencewould have been still more extensive. Three of these results may be fitly adduced to prove this position.
During the last few years above 500 of the worst of the london gamins have been sent outas colonists, chiefly at the cost of the Raggcd School Union. Nor, when they reached Australia or Canada have they been sent adrift, for adequate guardianship has been provided until work was obtained. As the effect of the prior industrial and moral training, not 10 per cent. have forfeited the goodwill of their patrons; but, by the local authorities, thev are acknow,edged to be industrious among the most industrious, and moral among those who are most characterized by self-control. It isnot strange, then, that one wrote home to say that, as driver of the ielbourne maileart, he received 1501. per annum, that he had saved 2501., and that he intended to transmit 1001. to pay the passage of his parents to that prosperous colony. 31any candidates still remain who seek to earn in another land the bread they cannot honestly obtain in Old England. But, alas! in reply to these earnest applicants, the Central Committee are compelled to say-
We have no funds !" Surely, a portion of the revenue now appropriated to erecting costly palatial prisons, like those at Holloway and Pentonville, would be more wisely expended intransferring some of these reformedvagrants and outcasts to a land where their history is unknown and where the strong arm of trained labour is required? At least, by this plan we should respond to the cry of the farmers of Australia-" Send us some more of Lord Shaftesbury's lads !"
Another pleasing result of Ragged Schools is included in the number of shoeblacks who stud the broadways of London, clad in cheerful blue, yellow, or red jerseys, and whose cry, " Clean your boots, Sir," is fast becoming incorporated into our language. Civil, cleanly, and attentive as they now are, not a few of the 110 lads thus employedcamefrom homes-if homes they had-whose filthyaspectwas a fit type of the moral filth of the district. Had they not been rescued by ragged school teachers, it would not have required the prevision of the seer to foretell their destiny; for too many would have illustrated the striking words of Inspector Pearce-" I never see a criminal boy at the bar of a poice court but I think, Well, you will cost the country 5001. before we have done with you!" But, thongh six years have not elapsed since this branch of labour was introduced, these boys have earned above 7,0001., their united earnings for the last financial year being 2,2701., representing 544,800 pairs of boots. Thus, then, do these outcasts not only support themselves honourably-for all labour, be it mental or manual, is honourable-but many have assisted to rescue parents and sisters from lives of vice and degradation, and all because they were led to enter and adopt the advice of the ragged school.
Nor can the fact be omitted that during the last three years not less than 3,342 of these poor victims of neglect obtained regular employment. Very gratifying is it to learn tbat of these 837 obtained the prize presented to those who had retained their situations for 12 months and upwards to the satisfaction of their employers-many more being debarred this reward solely through the necessarily stringent rules framed by the central committee, as trustees of the public. Thus, instead of adding their personal corrup?tions tothe vices of their class, they are steadily fulfillig the great law of labour, and upwards of 60, as teachers, are repaying the kindness whinch rescued them from want or vice, by aiding, in the powerful language of Dr. Chalmers, to "excavate the heathen of this great

For "slums" have been opened to the pub, which were once almost sealed to the polce; dissolute parents have been reformed thirough the direct influence of penny-banks, parents' meetings, and " ragged churches ;" and of Portland-town the police record that, while prior to the opening of the ragged school in 1849 239 lads were charged yearly, the number of culprits is now reduced below 50. Nor is this all- for who may tell the moral influence exerted by the 2,136 gratuitous labourers engaged in this noble work, some of whom add lustre to their coronets by their patient and affectionate labours ?
But, unhappily, most pictures have a background of gloom; nor would this sketch of ragged schools be a correct photograph if the shadows were omitted. Most ragged sclools are in debt, economically as they are conducted, the education of each scholar not costing much above 12s. per annum. At this time 63 schools are indebtedtotheirtreasurers in sums amounting to nearly 5,0001., and otbers are likely to die through the unnatural death of starvation. ' would also seeni that the Ragged School Union itself, apon which the origination of new and the friendly oversight of old efforts so much devolve, is labouring under a financial crisis, its grants to schools during the last three years amounting to 12,4121., and its expenditure having exceeded its receipts by 4,6501. Out of tbe 150 ragged schools united to the central society about 120 depend more or less on its annual grants. -Were, then, such assistance withdrawn, there can be little doubt that many of the affiliated institutions would be compelled to abandon their zealous efforts to civilize the wild tribes of London. This result, however, we cannot anticiliate, unless, indeed, society, in the face of bitter experience, should determine that it is easier to cruslh evil in the ilower than in the germ, and that to punish is better than to prevent crime.
Your powerful pen has often depicted the habits and modes of thought of the " dangerous classes," and indicated remaedies for these social evils, in which moral and industrial training and emigration have formed prominent features. Your work, Sir, is not yet finished, for " slums," where the very air wafts fever and cholera, and dens of infamy, euphemisticaUy yelept " Lodging-bouses for Travellers," still abound. Unlicensed peiny theatres, known by their wretched frequenters as " gaffs," still, by unveiled vice, mock decency out of countenance. In the bvways too, of London, " dolly-shops," or unlicensed pawnbrokers, are not a rarity, where all kinds of articles may be left in semi-pledge, and no prying questions asked. With temptations like these, abounding as they do in the lowv districts of Southwark and Westminster, it requires stronger moral courage than most city Arabs possess successfully to contend. Hence, should the doors of the huiblei ragged school be closed, the only plan of social amelioration which has acquired the confidence of these Blitish pariahs would cease to illumine the moral darkness which may be felt, and society uill discover, a day too late, tbat it must encounter a giant which, when a pigmy, might have been subdued by love, I am 9ir i K

Garotte Robbery By Artillerymen.-Colonel
GAROTT ROBBERY BY AtTItERYEy=N.-Colonel Gordon, late of the Royal Artillery, -was attacked and robbed by garotters on Friday evening last. Colonel Gordon arrived at Woolwich a few days since from Glasgow, on a visit to his son, a cadet in the Royal Military Academy. On Friday, after dining at the house of a friend at Chariton, the colonel proceeded along the Shooter's-hill-road to WoolNich, and on arriving near wvhat is known as the " Bluegate," on Woolhvich-common, he was attacked by three artillerymen, who seized hiu by the throat, and succeeded i carung off all the property about his person, including a silver snuffbox and a purse containin, a quantity of silver. On Satfuday Detective-officer (rouob, of the R division, examined the spot where the robbery took place, and at which a scuffle ensued between thecolonel and his assailants, and on instituting a strict search that officer found a soldier's pass belonging to James Price, a private of the 5th battalion of Royal Artillery, who was taken into custody on suspicion. The accused underwent an examination before Mr. Traill, the police magistrate, ye$terday afternoon, but was disebarged, the only evidence of a suspicious nature beyond that mentionedbeing that on the night in question he did not return to barracks until 12 o'clock (three hours after the robbery), instead of 11. Sinee the above occurrence orders have been issued by the commandant, General Sir r. Williams, by which 170 men are stationed every evening as pickets along the diflerent line of roads leading to and from the barracks.
THE WAR AC:AINST CHLNA AND PEBSIA.-(By Electric Telegraph.)-A public mneeting of the inhabitants of Birmingham was held in the Music-hall, Birminghlam, last night, Mr. Alderman Baldwin in the chair, to take into consideration the present Persian and Chinese wars. Among those present were-Mr. Joseph Sturge, bir. W. Morgan, Mr. J. S. Wriglt, Mr. J. Partridge, Mr. F. WVells, the Rev. C. Vence, the Rev. A. O'Neill, Mr. 0. Sturge, Matr. J. Bette, and many influential persons, Mr. W. ,lorgan, who moeved the first resolution deprecating the recent hostilities against China, expressed an opinion that, like the, last wvar against China,jthey had arisen out of a contraband trade in opium. He reviewed the history and general condition of China, and, after entering into various details to show the injurious effects of the trafic in opium, quoted the official correspondence from the Len a Garette, and exprossed an opinion that we had not a clear ground of quarrel against the Chinese on the present occa8ion, All the circumstances, he said, proved that the sudden resort to arms could not be justified. The Rev. C. Vence, who, seconded the resoluoton, said, that the proceedings of the British fleet had been hurried and precipitate, and that the coml3ict vas as unmanly as it was unjustifiable. (Cheorm) This resolution, and one condemning the war agaist-Persin, were .greed to. and petitiong to both .Eousea of Parliament foundeo upon them were adopted.

The State Of Newgate.
THE STATE OF Y.EWGA TB.
TO THE EDITOR OF TEiE TI3.S,
Sir,-Will you favour me with sufficient spacQ in your valuable columns to say, in reply to your correspondent "3. A." of to-day, and also my late under-sheriff Mr. J.- Anderson Rose, that plans for the teconstruction of the north v%ing of the prison of lXewgatc, as part of an entire reconstruction propo&edby theGatCommittee of the Court of Aldermen, were submitted te the Secretary of State for his approval in the early part of last year ? In March last these plans were returned to the committee for "reconsideration and more minute details," with suggestions having reference to the many requirements of such a prison as that of lNewgate- The fresh plans are now with the Secretary of State, awaiting his approval.
The Court of Aldermen passed a resolution empowering the committee to commence the reconstruction as soon as the Secretary of State should give his sanction to the plans now before him. I may also state that the Gaol Committee are now carrying out extensive alterations in the White. cross-street Debtors' Prison.
I would also, in reply to your correspondents' remarks, cllO the attention of the public to our city prison at Holloway, which for constructive arrangements and complete. ness of internal management I venture to say is not surpassed, if equalled, by any prison in this or any other country.
I am, Sir, your most obedient servA,Au
WM. A. ROSE,
ktember of the Court of Aldermen.

White Slavery.
WHITE SL4AVEBY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-'WM you permit me, through the medium of your valuable paper, to make known one of the many cases of cruelty and insult to which governesses are exposed? I was one of about 50 ladies (most of whom were accomplished gentlewomen) who applied last week, in reply to an adver. tisement in The Times, for a situation as governess in a family in the neighbourhood of Kingsland. The applicants vent from all parts of London and its environs; many were in consequence quite overcome vith fatigue, having walked long distances to save expense. After having been kept standing in a cold draughty hail more than an hour, I at last obtained an interview with the lady, and learnt that the duties of the governess would consist in educating and taking the entire charge of the children, seven in number, two being quite babies ; to perform for theni all the menial offices of a nurse, make and mend their clothes; to teach at least three accomplishments, and " fil up the leisure hours of an evening by playing to company." For these combinm'd duties the muniicent sum of lOl. per annum was offered. I ascertained for a fact that the two domestic servants in the same family were paid respectively 121. and 101. Surely in a countrv like ours some employment besides that of teaching could be found for educated women, or at least better treatment might be expected for those to whom is intrusted the responsible duty of forming the minds and manners of the rising generation. As the best means of correcting this evil may I beg you, Sir, to wield your powerful pen in behalf of this much-abused class
