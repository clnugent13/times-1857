R?AILWAY INTBELlMBNCO GREAT W.R'lNT 'h0 alfyearly meeting of this company was held a BnstI thesdterday 'ho Hon. Mr. Pousouby, tbe cham ! oDf thu direction, prWsdea. The report and accounts, abstractsof which have appeared ln 27ic ftmes, were taken as read. TchO CHax -A., baving claimed the indulgence of the 3meting upon the ground of his inexperience and its being the first occasion of hislappearing in this position, proceeded to say that the task was easier than might have been anticipated, arising from the fct that all disputes as to the policy of the companY might be considered to be at an end. They had hPeneh all the lines which they were authorized, or he dmight erhaps say bound, to construct, and it was now tho uty o. the directors and all who were ixterested in the company to endeavour to make the best of thfe property ss It was. Certain principles had been laid down by the shareholdrs and adopted by the directors for the future manage. inent of the company. He believed those principles to be to abstan from &4 branches, extensions, and guarantees which would prejiidice tteir funds; to devote thair attention carefully to the developement of traffic on the linee as they existed; and by fair and liberUl dealing with the companies with whom they might come into coatact to endeavoar to obtain for the shareholders ultimately some more adequate return for the great outlay which they had beenalled upon to make. (Cheers.) With these principles, ana looking to the fac that, vwith the exception of the accounts now ooming in for the completion of the lines lust opened, they knew exactly the extent of their capital amcount, there was no ground for any extreme alpia or panio as to the ftfure. Hle quite admitted there would be cause for alarm if a new series of lines were proposed, but hefelt sure the shareholders would have taken a lesson froan the past, and would not sanction such propositions, and he could say zost emphatically for the directozs they had no wish or intention to bring forward plans whih would s more injuriously affect the interests of the ordinary shareholders. (Cheers.) If the shareholders would give the board their assistance and suport, the directors would endeavour, to the best of t,her ability, to make the most of their property as it stood (i Hear, hear," and a Voscz.-We have had too many promises of that sort.) With the capital account ascertained and full oontrol of that account in the hands of the shareholders there -was no cause for panic or alarm whatever might be the present depressed state of the dividend. (Hear, hear.) He had felt it his duty to make inquiries as to the cost of the lines recently opened, compared with the estimatea given to the shareholders. It was his wish that such a comparative statement should be laid before them on the present occasion, but that was impossible, as the accounts were not altogether closed. The matter should be carefullv looked into, and a fuU statement8hould be laidbeforethoeexthalf-yearlymesting,which would enable them to see whether there had been an concealment of liabilities, and whether the estimates had been exceeded in the construction of the works. He was assured that it would turn out that the estimates 'were as fair and reasonable as could be made, and that the actual cost would as nearly as possible corspond with those estimates. The shareholders had only totakethestatementof theamounts in the Walpole report, and they would know exactly or very nearly what the cost of construction of these lines had been. As to expenditure of capital in other respects, there must be, no doubt, in every railway oompany, from time to time, a certain expenditure for the improvement of the line, the decison upon which rested with the sh6reholders. He could assure them that, although the board received continual application for sidings, alterations of stations, &a., everything was looked into most carefully by the expenditure comnuttee, and that the committee ke t everything down to the lowest possibleamount. It would be for the shareholders in future to say whether those ticular works should be carried on, and he was su re they would require fuU proof that the outlay wa for remulnerative purposes, (Hear.) It was true that in the lsst half7ear some expense had been incurred at Reading in connecting the narrow gauge of the Great Western with the lines of other companies, but that was under the sanction of a Bill authorized by the proprietors, nuder the belief that it was better this company should undertake the work rather than allow other companies to do it for them. He was informed that no work of msanitude was going on, and therefore there need be no fear of any great increase of capital beyond what was necessary for the completion of the line which had just been opened. (Eear, hear.) inaking some observations upon the report and accounts it was not their wish, he was sure, that he should enter into the history of past trnsactions, or attempt to prophety the future. The lirt thing to which he had to allude was the dividend norr proposed. He need not say that it was a matter of the gteatest regret to the directors that they should have to present accounts which showed so small an amount applicable to that purpose, and it was most painful to him on the first opportunity ot meeting them to have to place before the shareholders the worst account which he believed had ever been produced. He could only say that he hoped it might be the worst that ever would be presented. (Hear, hear.) Painfuly as this diinution of dividend would press upon many, it was the duLty of the directors to keep nothing back, and give the accounts as they stood. In considering the causes which had led to the reduction and lowness of dividend they had only to look to one or two items in the accounts. That the working eunses over rather more than 90 m'les of additionaT railvway which had been opened should exteed the increase of traffic on the whole line was, indeed, a startling fact; but it was one which should be a warning to them for the future, and also a warntsg to other companies, not to allow their capital to be increased to make branches to places already ccommodated, by which they ' not only prejudiced their neighbours, but failed to benefit themselves. (Cheers.) It was plainly placed before the shareholders that, baving opened these 90 additional miles of railway, which did not pay their working expenses, the ordinary shareholders had to pay the full amount of interest upon the money expended in their construction. With respect to the future they would not wish him to prophesy, but they would no doubt expect a promise that everything should he d(oe to keep the working and aU other expenses at the smalest possible amount. He could assure them that the best attentioul of the expenditure committee and the board of directors had been given to the subject, and that they were more impressed than ever with the necessity of continuing that course. A committee bad been appointed to examine thoroughly into the working of every station and the ruuming of the trains, with a view to make every practicable reduction. He was quite sure that the shareholden r uould not wish reductions merely for the sake of a momentary lowering of expenditure which would be accompanied with a more than corresponding lowering of income. He could assure them that no expenditure beyond what was necesseary would be incurred, that the committee which was about to sit would deal fully and freely with every question, and that although hewould not promise what reductions, the directors hoped many reductions would be made without affecting the working of the line. The receipts of the new lines were very small, and the goods traffic had fallen short of what tbe directors had anticipated. With respect to the position of the company this half-year, the board were most anxions that the shareholders should consider that there had been no concealment, and that nothing had beea kept back at previous meetings. By a par"aph in the 'Walpole report they would see that the pregent state of affairs had been to some extent foreseen. After going through the general position of the company, and speaking of its prospects for the future the report continued :- "At the same time it ought not to be disguised that their habilities are still large, and they must therefore be anticipated by every precaution which prudence can devise. Durin +he current half-year, indeed, they will not be felt to their full extent, but it may be anticipated with confidence that increasing receipts will balance them. In the nex% half-year most of the remaining liabilities will fall upon the current revenue, because bv that time the Wilts, Somerset, and Weyrnouth line, as well as the Uxbridge and Henley branches, will beopened. The extentof new revenue to be derived from these sources will depend upon the condition of the country, the activity of trade, and the in'duences which a state of peace or war may bring to bear upon the amount of traffic; but looking to the fact that the whole outlay of the undertaking will then be complete-that the expense incident to a portion of these lines is now borne by revenue, with scaTcely any return for it-that a reasonable traffic from the opening up of a new line of country which has not yet the benefit of railway accommodation may be expected-that the general receipts of the whole Great Western system are improving, not merely by fits and starts, but steadily and continuously, and that the proposed arrangements with reference to coal traffic will alone yfold an additional income of from 60,0001. to 80,0001. a-year, it is fair to conclude that there is much reason for confidence and hope, and that the proprietoyg will ultimately find, when the causes of the present depression have beeo removed, that they possess an investment which is permanently valuable and intrinsically scoure." (Hear.) Although the lines had not fully answered the expectations of the directors, and particoularly the goods traffio, the facts were there laid before them, and they had had, in addition. to bear the serious state of the money-market, which had revented any itnprovement of interest upon the debenture ebt of the company. At the close of the last half-year, seeing that the lines wer al about to be opened, the directors considered that the time was come for remodelling the engineering staff. A committee sat upon the subject, and sue new arangement ould, hePOpd besat- the nezz arrangement would, be hoped, be as satir, factory to the sharebolders as it was to the directors, He was bound to say that they were indebted to Mr. Brunel, the engineer of the company, for the liberal mnanner in which he had met their views upon the subject, (Some expresinons of dimpprobation.) It apeared to the committee that the first principle to be laid down was, that the heads of the engineerlng, locomotive, and carrinage departments should respectively be responsible to the board without the intervention of any other person. It necessa.ily foUowed that Mr. Brunel's position would not be the same thenceforth. The officers named were to be direetly responsible, and M1r Brunel was to hold the position of consulting engineer. Considering the many difficulties which might from time to time arise in the working of the company, and the many points upon whinch valuable assistance could be given by Mr. Brunel, the hosrd felt that it wvould be most desirable to retain his servicesl, at a, suffl- ient salary for the work which he would hase to do. (A Proprietor.-" What salkry?") The salary would be 750L a-year. The duties which he would perform were mUost impotat ntfor the interests of the company. Mr. Brumel would be the consulting engineer, giving his advice and assistance when the beard or their officers required it. Mr. Brunel s7ould give his assistance on all matters connected with pDublic bodies and the dealings with other companes, in which his position carried great weight, and he would give his assiStanCe in all Parliamentalry proceedings by which the interts of the: company might be attsek&l. It should be remembeered that if they depended upon ea]iing Mr. Brunel incidentally as a witness in one case it would cost as much as his present sala. (Hear hear.) 3ir. Brunel would also eomplete all matters on- nected with the winding up of the socouts over which he be had controL Mr. SAi.titt asked wbether Mr. Brunel would have any comniissions uponi cotiacts? The C}IH, I RtAN said the slry of 750. a-year was to indude eyerjthipg, and he had heard but one opinion ex- pressed-that it w* a mnost s-tisfactory arrangement. (Hear, hear.) He wihed partiularly to call their attention to an.- othermatter. They were asare that several of the lines recently completed were lines promoted by, and the property o, indoepeaent companies. Thowe lines had, from time to time, fallen into the hands of this company, the staffs of those companies had been rapidly reduced, and a great saving had been made. But great additional labour had been thrown, in oonsequenoe, upon their sectary, Mr. Saunders. Upon aclosing these accounts, and inquiring into the subjec it was brought before the committee, and! afterwards beforo the board. Bnt when these additional duties were cast upon the secretary a promise was Fgiven that upon the completion of the works he should be remunerated. He would not enter into the question of the iervices which Mr. Saunders had so long rendered. He had had little exrrience of those services, but dealing with it as a matter of honour nd justicethey were bound to perform the promihe which had been given, and the board had awarded Mr. Saunders for those past services a sum of 5,0001. (urrmus.) Having settled the amount, theonly quesion whioh remained was the time of paying it It night be sd that this was not the proper time. (Hear, hear.) He could only say thst in that opinion he did not toncur. Indeod, he mightsay the board did not concur in it. In passing a resolon upon the subject they accom- ed at with another resolation, that the matter should be brought under the attention of the shareholders at this meeting. and he owned he did not see any advantage in postponing to a more prosperous period the decdration of their opinion that the sum named was fair and just. For himself, he could only say that for the sake of some temporary eae he would never forbear making announcements of their intention as early as possible after the arrangements had been made. (Cheers.) The chairman of the Oxford, Worcestr, and Wolverhampton Company had made some observations at a recent meeting imputing blame to the directors of this company. The chairman of the Oxford (,ompany stated that the two companies were not on friendly terms, and that a offers on his part had been received with scorn. Ho wrote to say he was not aware of the offers to which the chairman of the Oxford Company alluded, and he had received an answer to the effect that it did not refer to anything which had tasd in the last half-year, or, he eved, even e last year. The chairman of the Oxford Company did, however, point out somne matters of complaint, but they were not of such magnitude as ought to prevent friendly relations being e6tambhed between the two companies. (Hear, hear.) One complaint was than an award had been made which was more favourable to the Great Western than to the Oxford Company. Another complaint was, that a sum of money had not been paid without the compulsion of a lawsuit. His reply was that it was paid as soon as the Great Western Company were advised that it was time to do so. There were also one or two points with regard to traffic arrangpments. The Oxford Company complained that the Great Western had refused to join in an excurson traia naig over the South.E n EaiSlway to Ramsgate. The factswere-that such an excursion train was run with the South-Eastern; that,theOxford Company were offered, but did not take part in it; that it proved an entire failnre, and that when a second was proposed the. directors of this company did not think themselves jiustified in havinganything to do with it. (Hear.) Az to the non-booling of a passenger at Oxford the Great Western admitted they were in the wrong. The servant of the company had been reprimanded, and to some extent had I suffered punishment. As to, other companies he believed they were on good terms, with the exception of the South-Eastern. The competition with that company still continued, although he hoped some arrangement would shortly be made to the satisfaction of the companies which meet at Reading, because nothing could be more detrimental to the interests of all than the state of things which at present existed. (Hear, hear.) He would do his heat to give every information which was desired; and in return he begged them to offer any suggestions which thelr judgment and experience might dictate. Not only at meetings like the present, but on all occasions, such communications would be accepted by the directors as a mark of confidence, and in conclusion he would ask them to give the directors their support, as by so doing they would strengthen the position of the company in the ees of the publioc (Cheers.) The hon. chairman moved, "That the report of thedireotorshe received and ad ptead and ircalated among the proprietors." fr. MDAiNS, in moving for a committee of investigation. said that if the Great Western Company were sound it would benefit by the examination, and that if it were unsound the sooner they faced the danger the better. (Hear, hear.) He was confirmed in this view by a paragraph which appeared In the Money Article of The Yimes on Monday last, which he read tothe meeting. He did not propose to susnead the dividend, because, however small :t was of great consequence to many of the proprietors, bat he doubtd whether that would not be the more proper ,ourse. He begged to move as an amendment:- /! - t ao ti report as -yovies io th. Py..t oi -dlxidend ot one-half per cent. be oondrmed, but thut the remander of the report, togetherwith theaccounta.be referred to a committee of rd propietors, rth ower to examne all hooks and docutene. and to sai fo- the serves tof oficials in poeseon theref, aod to reort tbereon teo a specil meetingF to be oonvened by the dretors on their requset, to seceive the same. Mr. IDWARDR seconded the amendment. To him the report was nothing more than moonshine. He knew an instance of a poor widow who some yeas go invested money enough in this oomny to pay her 2001. a-yeaT. She then kept a servant, bat he was sorry to say that her income tbis year from the com y would not pay a servant's wages. dnear, hear.) He didnt mean to say that Mr. Saunders d not deserve the Money proposed to )eifgiven to him, but ho did not approve of uri £ applica on of money under preacnt cicumsiances. He vould not join in any eulogy I upon Mr. Branel, because he thought the source of all the extravagance wastbeir engineer. (Elear, hear.) Diminished dividends must prevent traffic, and he had doubts whether next year the revenue would be greater than it vas at present. Air. ATnsox, ons of the auditors, in reply to Mr. Malins, stated that it had been certified to them that the rolling stock was better than it had been for the last four or five years. (Chees) MAjor COURTm said the obairman had observed that the future expenditure of the company must depend on the sbareholders, and he hoped the shareholders would look to that matter. They might exercisetheir responsibility upon the proposed expenditure of 40,0001. for locomotive stock. By the Great-Western accounts 815,0W10. had been expended under that head, and in the Shrewsbury acounts he found an additional 123,0001. The total sum was 939,3521. They ought to insist upon having a clear insight into what was proposed to be expended. The mainteaance of way account vas increased, but there ought to be no increase under that head with respeot to the lines just fnished. (Hear, hear.) As far as he could make up the account 8,0001. was charged against revenue for interest on loans more than the calculations in the report would yield. A1 tbough that was more a question for the auditors, he thought there were sufficient grounds to require the appointment of a committee. Mr. Gums contended that a railway company was entitled to the whole of the secretary's time, and he could not understand how Mr. Saunders could perform works of supererogation. (Hear.) If the company were successful thev might show their gratitulde by voting sway a large SUmU oi money, but he thought it wfas in the worst possible taste to propose to pay away any sum, whether large or small, which could bce avoided. (HIear, hear.) In reply to MIr. SAXEIt, The CsNt N said that Mr.Saundersds salarywas2,50l. a-year. Mr. AvEsY concurred in the importance of small savings, but objected to a saving which would be an impeachment of their justioe. The services of Mr. Saunders, for which ynent had been promised, had been given, and the board My deoided upon tne amount which it was fair and just to pay. The direction were making arrAngements which must have a beneficial effect on their property, and nothing was mnore calculated to inJure the fature of the company than the appointment of Mr. Mains's committee. hLr. rARTiiDGE said that in June, 1o47, the capital of the Great Western Company did not exceed 3,000,0001.,and the disposable balance was 255,3431, giving them 8 per cent. per annum. The capital was now 8,2500004, and the disposable balance 3L L971.,giving them 1 per cent.!per annum. Mr. Saunders had had a vast deal of toil and an Immense deal of anxiety, for which no sum of money could ever compensate him, and he had no doubt of the talent both of Mr. Brunel and Mr. Saunders, but, as a commercial man, he looked to results. In his opinion, it was necessary to have a committee of investigation. Mr. EHAsALL also supported the amendment. Mr. BROWN thought it would require very bold and deci. sive economy to recover their position. If the number of trains were reduced a third there would be plenty of roling stoolc, and no necessity for spending the 40,0001. in locomotive plant. He stated that -OU Times, in a very pleasant humour, toald themthat theyliad spent their money, but had granted great facilties to the public. He therefore con. cluded there was plenty of room to get good dividends with. out oppressing the public. (Hear.) He ugagested that Mr. Malis should withdrxw his amendment, and the directors assent to the nominaton of four shareholders to act -with the proposed committee of investigation appointed by the board, but to report separately. Mr. NoRPis reviewed the cause of depression in the sanction of so many miles of railway, which had turned out unprofitable. The millstone round their necks was the large amount of borrowed and guaranteed capitaL He del'-reeated the appointlment of a committee of shareholders as detrinental to tneir own interests and destructive of the confidence of the monoy-lending public in the company. There had already been cmmittees of investigation, and the company had derived no benefit from them. He was not sure that he was not the person referred to in nTe Times as the aboriginal shareholder who so quetly watchel his money wasting away. (Laughter.) He vished to ask whether it was true that this company bad renewed debentures of 1,0001., at 5 per cent., for 9501. ? Mr. ATKiNSON said that in no instance had debentures been issued at a discount. Mr. BAKER advocated the infusion of new blood into the direction. Lord B.ns=TGTWTON, tho vicochairman, said they would be gFad to get men of business, but men of business had their own affairs to manage, and would not accept the offioe. Mr. BRucE thought there was room for improvement, although he highly esteemed the present direction. The CHAImAN said there would be no diffiolty in making room for gentlemen of commercial experience if such men could be induced to joiu the direction. h3r. SALNSBuRY, as a shareholder in 13 comapanies, -with 20 yeas experlienc. aesured the proprietors that he never knew an instance of any beneficial results whatever following theappointment f a committee of inquiry. Wr. MALns said he should go to a divison upon the amendmnsnt. He had known instances in which benefii had resulted from committees of inquiry, and Thze Times in its City Article told them it was the hest thing they could do. Jn reply to questions,- The CHAmnx? said the coal traffic was 41,0001. this ' halfyear as compared with 28,0003. last half-yesr, and although that was not as much as it ought to yield, still it was a marked increase. (Hear, hear.) The proposal to appoint a committee bore very much the appearance of their not iaving confidence in their directors for the future. At the next 1ialf-yearly meeting a full statement of the cost and the esimates of the new lIne would bepresented and if bis assrtion that they olosely a roximated was ne. borne out, then would be the time to on the directors for explwation. He repeated the romie to infuse fresh blood into the airecton, anad appea?n t Mr. mains, for the sake of the company, to withdraw his aendment. A PitOPRIzTOR asked whether it was to be understood that the board would receive fouar practical men. The CHAntsi replied affLrmatively. The PROPRBITOR said he should then vote for the directors. (Hear, herr.) The amendment was put end negatived by at least two to one, and the original resolLtion was carried by even a larger majority. The resolution dedlaring a dividend was paseed unan.i mously, and the proceedings terminated. LONDON AND NORTH-WESTERN. The 23d half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the Euston Station; the Marquis of Chandoa in me i0r.I Mr. Stewart, the secretary, read the report, an abstract of 'which has appeared in 17se Times. The Cs&rsisu then rose to move that the report with the half-yealy statement of accounts be received and adopted, and ibat it be printed and ircuLated mnong_the_ proprietors. He said,-The Circuaton of the report with the accounts at an early date before the meeting has considerably lessened my labouns in oxplaining to you the proceedings of the directors for the lamt half-year, and I am afraid has conal' derably lessened the attendance of the proprietors. Since the plan has been adopted of transrmitting these documents to the shareholders the meetings have been less fully attended; but this is a result which I rather regret, for I am always pleased to Eee a large and influential numnber of the proprietors present to take nart in the proceedings, to bear the statements of the directors, and to pass their opinion upon the conduct of those to whom is entrusted the nmanagement of t he affairs of this company. (Cheers.) The report which has been sent to you wrill, however, have afforded you ample opportunity of considering the exertions that have been made by the directors with the view of promoting the interests of the companyand, although it is not neceasary that I should enter at aIl into a detailed statement of what those exertions have been, there are one or two points in the accounts to which I wil1 call your attention. From the accoUnts it will be seen that we have made in this, the bad half-year, a 5 per cent. dividend, and it would not have been difficult for the directors to have shown a larger net profit duoing this half-year had they confined themselves strictly and entirely to repairing and maintaining the stock and the road in the identical form in 'which they were many years ago, withouxt any improvements, or by charging improvemenb against capital, or by asking you for votes of additional capitalto be expended in the improvement of them, In two or threeitems of the accounts you Wi see that there is an increase in the permanent way expenditure; the locomotive, the carriage, and the vwaggon repairs have cost a considerable sum; and there has been a large amount expended from revenue on actual imiprovements in the rolling stock and in new works. The increase In the permanent way department is attributable to a considerable outlay on the bridges on the Peterborough line. These bridges were built many years ago at ^ comparatively small cost, the original material being wood; but they have been replaced, having fallen into decay, by the more solid and durable material of stone, which is a rather more costly work, and have been paid for out of revenue. There Is also a charge, amounting to 2,0001., for new sidings and other works, which can scarcely be called maintenance of way, although It is so brought into the account, and that accounts for a part of the inrease. In the locomotivo accounts also, as well as in the carriage and waggon department, considerable sums of money have been expended beyond the strict maintenance of the rolling stock. A large portion of the increase under the head of locomotive power will be in the items of repairs and ienewals. lu the report the directors have pointed out some things for which thay ask for further capital, the principal items of which are houses on the Stour Valley line, carriage sheds, and additional carriages for pbEsengers and goods. With regard to the houses, for which we ask the sum of 6,0001., the expenditure has long been postponed, but it has now, in the opinion of the directers, become absolutely necessary to provide againsttheigreat demoralization among your servants, which has taken place from the wretched and inferior class of lodgings in those districts, which has brought them into contact with bad characters, which has already tainted the charcter of some, and, unless removed, may taint the character of all. The sheds are intended to protect the carriages and other rolling stock from exposure to the weather, as it has been found that they suffer as much, if, indeed, not more, from this cause than if thty were in actual service. It is therefore proposed to erect at convenient points of the line sbeds for the protection of the carriages. With regard to additional stock, we require an addition to our waggon and passenger stock to meet the inerease which has taken place during the last few years in our goods and passenger traffic. Additional branches, the construction of which was authorized a few years ago, will be opened in the course of the next 12 months, and furtherstock will berequired for them. During the past half-year we suffered some loss and inconvenience by tne destruction of the warehouses at Camden-town. New warehou will be erected and ready for use by the ensuiug winter for the reception of goods. The works on the branch linea are proceeding even more faiourably than the directors could have anticipated. owing to the fineness of the weather and the exertiors of the contractors. The proceedings in Parliament during the past sesdon, in conniexion with your lines and some public measures relating to railway subjects, have been referred to by your directors. One of those Bills was a measure with reference to the conveyance of mails by railway. Your directors united with those of every other railway in the kingdom in praying the Government to withdraw that Bill, and it was withdrawn, The directors were of opinion that the importance of the Bill could not be overratedL They felt that it was their duty and the duty of everv railway board to give to the Post-office service every facility and accommodation that could possibly be afforded - but at the same time they felt'that it is also your right to be properly and fairly zemunerated for such services. (Cheers.) They considered that that Bill trenched on your rights, and they felt it to be their bounden duty to take the omeasres which they adopted with regard to it. They hope that in any future attempt of this ind they will meet with the cordial support of every person interested in railway property. (Cheers.) I have no faith in the success of any legislative measure for security, punctualty, or certain speed upou railways. Ibelieve that the more legislation is directed to the effecting of those objects, which was a portion of the general design of thell, the greater wil be the difficulties and the barriers thrownintheway of railwaycompanies. (Cheers) Ihaveno faith intheresultof pladngrailwaycompameiunderpenalties for their own default or the default of other companies. if those penalties have for their object the enforcing at all times and under all circumstances the utmost speed which by the most careful arrangements can be safely attained, I believe that a system of penalties will result in increased danger to the public, and in no increased punctuality or certainty as regards the trains. The position of this company in relation to other railway companies is this, that the proprietors have been so fully informed before this meeting y te correspondenoe and documents that have been issued that I should not, perhaps, have thought it necessary to advert to the subject had it not been that one of the gentlemen concerned in the letters and statements on which the charges against this company have been fouinded bas recently addressed to me a letter, in which, being naturally desirous as a professional man and a inan of honouF, to vindicate his conduct, he denies having been a p vrty to the gettiung up evidence for such charges. This letter he addressed to me in July, and in my reply I told him I should feel great pleasure in reading it to the meeting, and my object in doing so is to clear Mr. Baxter from any imputation that might have been cast upon him from the supposition that he was in any way connected with these proceedings. [The noble lord then read the letters.] I have much pleasure in exonerating Mr. Baxter, as I most certainly do, from the slightest participation in any such transsction. The proceedings to which these letters refer have materially affected our relations in many quarters. The conduct of one company in breaking off an agreement entered into with another company cannot but act prejudiciaUy upon similar agreements and engagements between other companies, and tend very much to loosen that bond which has hitherto united railway companies, at all events, in honour and good faith, whatever may bethe legal effect of the relations which they have entered into. It is mentioned in the report that an agreement between this company and the Midland Company has, in consequence of certain legal proceedings, been cascelled, but the proprietors need not, Iam sure, be under any appre hension that the cancelling of that agreement vl la any way affect the concord and friendship which has hitherto existed between the two companies, and, whatever attempts may have been made to sow discord between us, thereseacs of thechairman of the Midland Company on ts occasion is, I think, a suicient proof that thev have utterly failed, as I trust any similar attempts will fail in future, With reference to the position in which we are placed by the loosening of our eugagements with other companies, the directora feel confident that it is such thae the traffic of our line, poperly developed a economically worked, will enable us to maintainit and protect ourselves against any attack that may be made against us, 'The safety of your revenue and of your profits munst rest not upon agreements which are liable to be broken and disturbed in this manner, but upon the accommodation which you afford to the public, upon the efficiency and the certainty with which your business is performed, and with which the public are conveyed over different parts of yonr line. It is to the resources of your own line, it is to the proper and efficient working of that line, that the directors-look for protection against suchattacks. (Cheers.) The directorslook with confidence to the future. They feel satisfied that they wiUreceive the hearty and unanimous, .support of the shareholders, and at h that support these attacks will not result in any ultimate loss. The immediate consequences of the repudiation of these agreements are not so much to be regarded as are the future effects of such a proceeding upon the gemeral union of railway companies. The directors believe that the agreements which have subssted for a series of years between different companies have resulted, whatever may have been said to the cont-r-ar advantageous to the interests of the proprietors and 'n additional convenience to the public. They certainly do not believe that either the interest of the proprietors or the interest of the public is promoted by competition earried on under special eircumstances, lasting. osily tem- porarily, frequently resulting in higher rates and in less aecommodation to the public than was previously afforded. We belihve that the interests of raiway proprietors and tho interests of the public are identicaL The interest of railway proprietors is that the line should be worked so as to afford to them a fair an4 ful remunera tion for the oitlaythey have incurred ; and the interest of the public cnsists is, the railway being efficiently worked, andshetraflic fully developed. Neither ofthoseresultais, in my opiniun, lik'e to bo secured by over-competition under special circu ances; and I do not think thas pad exper tt elce will ontrovert what I have advanced. (Cheers.)

He had read all the documents which had been circulated by the two companies from the date of the special meeting of the xMachester, Sheffield, and Lincoln- ire Railway to the publication of the most recent correspondoince, and the conclusion at which he had arrived, after a very careful examination of the whole of the evi- dence, was that the London and North.Western directors ma. acted tbhroughout in an honourrable and straightforward Mr. DASirT concurred in the resolution which had just been propsed le thought the conduct of the officera of the company as wQll as nf the directors, highly creditable to he Loxdon and North-Western Company, and he felt con. vinced that no man of right feeling could carefully-read through the statement which had circulated in reply to the six charges brought against the board wit0out experiencing a sentiment of the deepest regret that anybody of gentlemen should have been induced to lend themselves to the course adopted by the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Company. (Hear, hear.) 1r. LOCICB, &.P, sad that some years ago he called the attenton of the proprietors to the compartive expenditnre of the two locomotive establishments of the London and North-Westen Company at Crewe and olverton, and, after repeated endeavours on his part, certain gentlemen were appointed a committee to insttute quiries into thesubject. Those inquires resulted i a report hnd,g that upon an6 e,expenditure of between 200000. ad 30,001 thre aseffected a saving ixx the expendture at the Crewe establishment of nearly 30,0001. a-year. (Hear, hear.) Most men would be of the same opinion with bimeelf, that any man who, at the head of any department of the company's service, had the oontrol and direction of the company's money to the amount of between 200,0001. and 300,0001. a-year, and could effect a saving of between 30,0001. and 40,0001 was entitled to the cordial support and best wishes both of directors and proprietors (Bear.)That man, however, hadhbeendismnissedfrombispostat Crewe. (Cries of II"Shame.") "I say shame, too," continued 3tr.Locke, "because there is not a gentleman sitting on the other side of the board who could point a finger upon an act of his which betrays a want of ability, of honey, or of integrity. ' Had the gentlemen whom he then saw before him been at Crewe yesterday, and witnessed, as he (Mr. Lvcke) had done, the deep feelings wbich were entertained for the loes of the captain and head of that establishment among the 2,000 men who for 17 wears had been under his control and superintendence, they would have paused before they had dismissed him from their service. They had shown favour to the extravagant expenditure at Wolverhampton, by punishing the man who had saved them 30,0001. a-year at Crewe! After a few observations from Mr. Puicc}R, MIr. HADrIEL, hLP., contended that the company ought to pay at therate of 7 per cenL at least, and as n increase of traffic appeared to result in increase of dividend, he most earnestl pressod upon the attention of the board that the strength of the finanoe of the company lay in economy-in savings. He wished he could rouse railway proprietors, as well as directors, from their apathy, and induce them to unite in a proper representation to Government for the purpose of getting some relief from the monstrous taxation under which they snffered. In 185, for instance, the actual amount paid on account of taxes was no less than LiO,0001. He was opposed to the paing of any resolation by the proprietors winch should have the effect of aggravating the hostile feeling of the London and North-Western Company. Mr. DEwtNE concurred in the propriety of all that had been said by the hon. member who had just sat down as to the exceeding desirableness of economy in every department of the fnance of a public company. He then made some suggestions with regard to the accounts whioh he thought would simplify them, After some observations by Mr. Riley, Captain Porter Mr. Healey, Mr. Dickenson, Mr. Wrigley, and the CbAirman, Resolutions were pased adopting the report, declaring the dividend at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum for the half-year on the consolidated stock of the corapany and other dividends, as recommended in the report. The prooeedings conduded with a vote of thanks to the chairman. EA STERN COUNTIES. The directors of this oompany have just issud a very long report on the affairs of the company. It states that the receipts to which the Eastern Counties Comnpany re entitled amount to 519,2151. for the past half-year, and the expenses to 300,0971., leaving a balance of 219,1171 less interest on I gurantees and loans paid during the half-year amounting to 141,94. leaving a balance of 77,1634; to whichl is added 7,5134 balance from last taccnt, and 3,1184 balance remaining ator settlement of Eastern i Union Traffic Account, making 87,7994 From this is deducted 8,0001. for deferred permanent way renewal account, leaving 79,7994 applicable for dividend, and being farl c dae to the proprietors,- the directors have declared a divi end of f5i per share on the consolidated stock of the comrany, amounting to 72,920h, leaving a balance of 6,8791. forue next account The increasein thenat receipt eacompared witb the correspondinghalf of 1856 amountto 31.877; and instead of a loss on the working under the agreemens with the Norfolk and Eastern Union Company of 27,3441., as in the half-year ending Jnue, 1856, there is shown for the pat half-years loss of only 1,8721, thus reducing the workig expenses from 501 per cent. to 461 per cent. There has been no addltion to the caital account during the past half-year in respect of the locomotive or permanent way departments; thereowas an addition of 1,750. for buildings ordered inm IS, and of 7,4171. for land, An explanation of improvements in the mode of keeping the accounts of the company is given, the consolidation of the locomotive andpermanent way departments, the coal traffic and foreign cattletraffic. Inconclusion, the directors state they have been animated with but one desire-that of improving the property. They have endeavouredto serve the publicin every way consistently with due regard to the interests of the company. They state they have incurred no charge other than that which has been brought against revenue; and they have avoided all unneessary outlay of every kind that could be brought as a oharge against capitaL Looking to the fAct that the whole of the Bad Anghan district is now in posEession of the company, free from foreign interference an control, they are not without reaonable expectations of materially improving the condition of the property.
FAIL URB of the ATLANTIC TELGCRAPH. (BY ELECTRIC AND 1 TERWAIOINiAL TELFokA.) PLYMOUTHE, FBmnAY EvZ-G. The United States' steam-frigate Niagara, Captain Hudson, from the Atlantic, followed by the Srsquehanna, Captain Sands, and Hler Majesty's screw enltered thc Sound this afternoon on their return from their unsuccessful effort to lay the telegraphic cable. On board the Niagara they report that at the time of the severance, a quarter to 4 o'clock on Tuesday morning, 335 nautical or about 380 statute miles had been laid, at a distance of 26() to 280 miles in a direct course from Valentia. The wind was southerly, there was some sea, and the ship was going from three to four knots, at d the cable paying out five to six, and sometimes seven, knots. As the quantity of slack thus expended was greater than expected at starting, and more thau could be afforded, the retard strain -was therefore increased to a pressure of 3,000 pounds, and the cable broke. The extra exDenditure of slack commenced on Monday evening, when a strong breeze and heavy swell ptevlled, and a powerful undercurrent was experienced. This current forced the wire from the ship at a considerable angle. When the break was applied with increased power the stern of the Niagara was down in the trough of a sea, and the extra strain created by her rising was the immediate cause of the cable's parting The Susquehanna was a mile off on the Niagara's starboard beam; the Agamemnon, the Cyclops, and the Leopard were within signal distance. At 12 o'clock the Cyclops left for Valentia, and the Leopard for Spitbead. The other three remained to make some experments. SoundiDgs were found by the Cyclops at 2,000 fathoms. At night they kept a course E.S.E., under easy steam, and on Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock bore up for Plymouth Sound. The N iagara is gone into Hamoaze. The general opinion is that the season is too far advanced for another effort new, but every confidence is expressed in the ultimate success of the undertaking. The machinery now aboard the Niagara is considered too heavy for the purpose. It is stated that the wheels ceased to revolve when the pressure was applied on Tuesday mornng.

PARLIAMENT'AR Y 1NTELLIGENC1 ROUSE OF LORDS, FRwIDY, AuGUsT 14. The LoRD CRANCELLoR took his seat on the woolaack at 5 o'clock. Lord ST. LEONARD S presented a petition from a gntleman whose name wag not beard in the gallery, oomplaiuing that a suit connected with the administration of an estate in which he was interested had been pending in tho Court of Chanoery su.ce IS33, and had notye* been decided.. The noble lord 'Fxpreezed ahope that the Lord Chancellor would cause sunje inq ury to be made intofthe allegations of the petition. The LORD CEANCE[LLOR asid, this was the fizst time he had heard of the case to whtch the petition referred. He might observe, ho Pever, that the Court of Chanoery was often apparently to blamne when the lault reted with the sutors themselves, who did not choose to stir, and to whom the Court was co.nsequently unable to afford any remedy. He did not believe the general bnsiness of the Court of Chaneery had ever been inr a nore satisfactory state than at the present time, and lie said this with the more oonfidence because he took very little of the merit to himself. When ho.waa a practitioner in the oourt there used to be for years hundreds of cases unheard, but that ws not so now. (TLord St. Leonard's.-' There are so many judges") No doubt, if there were not so many judges the businew could notbein so forward a state; hut the appeals he had heard during the present year hsd generally been appeals against decrees which had only been made six weeks or two months previously. He belteved thAt. although there was nO deficiency in the number of judges, there was a de- cidency in the official staff of those judges, and be thought it wvould be absolutely nseoeiary to provide for the increase of that sta ff. He would b,ke care that the statements of the petition presented by bi8 noble and learned. friend. were inquired into. Lord ST. LEONARD'S thoulbh great caution wonld be neoessary in increasing the staff of officers, beause if they overloaded the staff in <h, mbern they would, he feared, t some extent add to the evils which at present existed, He observed that his noble and learned friend on the cross benches (Lord Went leydale) had last night called attention to the subject of wills executed by British subjects abroad, and he understood his noble friend had suggested that such prons should execute two wills, one according to the Engilaw, and the other according to the law of the foreign State in which they were residen t. If, however, tbey were to be governed by the law of domicile, an English subject domiciled in Frnce must not merely execute a will in the form required by the French law, hut its substance must agree with the Frencb law. As the French law did not admit of so liberal a disposition of property as the English law, an Englisthman residemit in Frmnce might make two wills-one according to the Frenbh, aud the other according to the Ernglish law, and ite might be fonnd that it was impossible to carry into effece th- dicpositimu of hisl proper. B3e expressed a hope th4t, thp Government would turn thelr attentin to this subject darinig the recess, withl the view of preparing some proper measare to he submitted to Parliment. Lord CAMPBELL also hoped that there would be some legislation onthe subject. Ee felt some interest in the mabtter, for he hardly knew in whatntry he wag domiciled.. If he went So Ireland., here he had some little property, it might he said he was domiciled there, and it WAS desirable that some real palpable rule should be laid down with respect to the subject. The LORD CHANC9LLOR believed it was not an easy task to settle the question of domicile, and, on consideration he wa of opinion that the Bill before Parliament wonid not meet a11 the evila complained of. INDIA. Lord ELLENBOROTJGHE-_ can hardly think that a discussion with respect to domicile, however important, is one of that emergent character which your lordships had in contemplation when you allowed a quarter of an hour after 5 o'clock to be appropriated for the purpose of putting questions and making observations, on matters which do more especially bear the character of emergency, and at the present moment I think your lordships are rather more in terestedby the news we have received from India. (Hear, hear.) Therefore I trust that, though a few minutes have elapsed since the quarter past 5 o'clock, I may be permitted to put a question to the Secretary for War, which I wu unable to put when the Militia Bill passed through the House. What I want particularly to know is what application he intends to make of the 200,0001 voted by the Howe of Commons for the embodiment of the militia? I may be allowed shortly to draw Your lordships' attention to the actual position in which we stand with respect to military preparations during a great war. Of course I have not access to official documents, but I have endeavoured to obtain from the ordinary chatnels of information as correct data ks I could, &ad I do not think that they willcontain any inacculracy calculated to affect my statement. I assume that 18 battalions have either been sent or are ordered to proceed for service to India. Five which had been oentto.Chinaaro also going to India. Five, I understand, in addition, have been warned that they will be the next required. for that service Two, it is understood, have been ordered-or are expected to prvoeed from the Cape to ;a, and we know that the 37th Regiment has been sent from Ceylon. There were in India 22 battalions before, and therefore, on the supposition that al this force prooeeds to India-and, considering the information we have most reoently received, I can hardly entertain a doubt 'hat the whole of the five regiments warned for the next service in India will be sent,-the total force to be employed in India amounts to 52 battalions, and the wing of a regiment (I am speaking of infantry); and that is a larger infantry foroe than was employed in the Crimea during the late war When ve had in the Crimea 50 battalions, what was our position At home ? We were reduced in this country to U battalions, but we had the militia, the effective force of which was about 66,000 men. Of that force 17 regiments were employed in the Mediterranean garrisons, and I assume that the force of those regiments amounted to 11,000 men. We have now at home, I believe, 18 battalions, and it is understoed that three battalions are ordered home, which will make 21 battalions. Therefore we shall have 21 battalions at home, whereas during the Crimean war we had only 11 battlion& But at that time we had a militia force of 66,000 men, of which 11,000 men-that is, 17 regiments, were employed in the Mediterranean,so that we had 6:5,000 militia in England. We bad therefore at that time in England U battallons and 55,000 militiamen. We have new, or soon shall have, 21 battalions in England. I asswme that the ten additional battalions are equal to 8,000 men, and we therefore have 8,000 more regulars in Emigiand than during the Crimean war, but unless the militia force is embodiod we shall have 55,000 less of militiamen. Now, I assume that 200,0001,, voted by the House of Commons, will enable the Goverament to employ 9,000 men during six months. Therefore we stand in this way. We have 8,000 more regulars than during the Crimean war, and, deducting 9,000 men from 55,000, we shall have 46,000 less of militia; altogether we shall have 38,000 less of armed men In this country than we had during the Crimean war. Now, I am of opinion that this is a very much more important and more dangerous war than that carried on in the Crimea. There we made war in conjnnction with the greatest mili. tary Power in Europe, and -we were in alliance with the Power with respect to wlsose territory the war was being carried on. We had on our side a powerful allv. We were on good terms with France, and it was impossible to consider it as a thing which could by possibility happen that anything could ocour between France and us during our oo-operationin that war, in which France was employing her own military strength, which would require us to maintau any considerable military force in this country. We had at the same time a large naval force, which kept at bay the military and naval forces of lissia. We are now carrying on a great war at a vast distance from this country without one ally, and can we even say that we have even the good. wies of all those who co-operated with us in the last war? I think this a subject calcatlated to excite great alarm, and. which demands from the (overnment and from your lordships the most mature consideration. We had in the former war a great naval force. Whatever naval force we now have is employed in China in fighting the battles of Sir John Bowring. Is that, my lords, a position in which this conntry ought to be placed ? I have told your lordships the amount of force which will be employed in India. Lot me now ask you to consider what number of recraits will be absolauly necessary every year to keep these battalions up to their complement. In doing this the loss by climato is to be estimated as well as the loss inflicted by the enemy, and I fear this must fAr exoeed the ordinary lcs constantly endured in India, because of course the troops must march on many occasions withoutthose advantages and resources whioh they invariably enjoy in times of peace. I calculate it would be impossible ta provide less every year than 10,000 men to keen up these 50 battahons to their oomplement. We have, besides 2,000 artillery, and it will, I think, be necessary to provide 400 artillery recruits to keep up that force to its proper comcplement. Then we have, or are to have, besides, eight regiments of cavalry. On the supposition that these eight regiments of cavalry are to be maintained at the ordinary strength of 600 men which prevails in India, they wonld amount to 4,800 men, and the number of recruits required by them in the me proportion wil be 960. The East India Company have a very large force of artilery consisting of nine battalions, and I am sorry to say it usually happens that the casualties in their force are greater than in Her Majesty's I cannot calculate the recruits required for the Company's European troops in India during the oontinuance of this war at less than 4,000 men every year, so that the whole demand for recruits will not be less than 15,360 annually. That force must be provided in addition to. the number of men usually required to keep up the rest ofEer Majesty's army in the colonies andathome to its complement. It is said that it is. a matter of great importane to consider the expense which will be incurred if'the whole of your militia is embodied. It seems to me, bowever, that the thing of most importance is the security of the country And this I fee atisfied-that unlessyouembody the whole of the militia, and thus lways have the opportun'ty of recruiting from it, it wi be quite contrary to reastn to expect that you will be able durng the continuance of this war to find the number of recruits sseeessry to keep the army up to its complement, But he let nine say a word or two as to the expense. Re. collect that whei'io u detch 30 battaions to Iudia you are at one relieied fron ghe expense of maintaining that force, which wve may rechon at 900,00 . a-year, The sum of 2MOOO baa beenaoldy Ves.

We are now in the position we occupied 54year lgo as regards the whole of thre U rrovinoes and the whole of Central India. We are wbsee we were when Lord Lake inarched on Cawnpore in 1806. Butl hero iz this ditnerence, and one which tels aeainred u-that we have our fo:xe disseminated inba and f als poions, and don'tepo,saes the advantage which we should haLve enjoyed had that force been concentrate-d and fit forinmnediate action. No one can look at the mattered poition of our troops even in the Paniab-whei I believe we shall have the wiuve support of the popmlation-lo one can. consider the position in which otr army now stands before De"hi, in which our troops are plae d at Allahasbad, ausd which they occupy (if the, are itil the) at Cawnpore, without coming to the conclusion that that poson, though a noecesry consequence of the events whlih have taken place, is a false one, extremely damaging to us as a military Power prepared to make war i India. My lords, I cannot view these cireumatLauc without very gmt, alarm. I feel it to be absolutely noecssary, if we would maintain our national honour, if we would maiataun that noblest of empires which has been acquired by the genius, the enterprise, and the vaslour of successive soldierg and statesmen during half a century, that.we shouldl makeo an effort such as this oountlvy never bas adoe in war, I am mre that witeoxt such as effort we must fai for we have not the advantag we enjoyed before ; we have not an army dividled between different princes and potentates jealous of each other-one with us and suother against us, nor have wema far as I knowthe Rd ofAuy-c f thekoope. upon Who. we formerly relied. My lords,wea cm6 dt ficult position for reoouquering' than ever we wer6 i acquiringlIndiA ; sd what I desire isthat, while u-care maintaining this great contes with all ouLr strength, we shold arrsonou ciade athom ad mnake it so secur agans al pssileattcktha i shllnot Occur to any natin jalou ofourpowe aboad,jeaousof our wealth aT. hom, n inerfre ithus hil weare engaged In pire,~ ~ ~ ~~~o ea a m lord PANMIURE.-The noble ear,in aidnghis question relative to the mDitia, ha diverged into other topics with referenoe to India and to the chances of European troubles. I shall endeavour, in a few words, to zeply to the observa. tions he has made. With regard to the vote of 200,00W9., which we have aked from Parliament as a credit for the expense of the embodied militia, it is contemplated to apply that sum to the embodiment of 10,000 of the militia be. tween this and the 25th of March nexL Previous to that date, by the 1st of February, Parliament, in the usal course of things, will have reaembled; so that naturally this vote of credit, which wIl sffice for 10,000 men, would not reach beyond the 1st of February. What the Government required was that they should be enabled to embody the militia without the necessity of immediately calling Parliament together. Bat my opinio is that if it should be roquisite to embody more than this force of 10.000 or 12,000, circumstanoes will have occurred and events will have hbppened which will render it necessay that Parliament ahould meet, and that the represen. tatives of the people should have a voice in the meure5. proposed to cope with the emergency. It is, my lordg, in. tendod to embody these 10,000 men in any of the garrisong which may have been weakened by the despatch of troops. to India. Far be it from me to underrate the magnitude of the crisis which has arisen in that distant country. It fils me, I will not say with alarm, but with. the deepess anxiety; but I think tha the reliefs. which have been sent to India upon the requisition, and beyond the requisition, of the Government of that country wiMl at least for a time suffioe to calm much apprehensioi. I may state to the House that sinco the begnning of the, year-nay, since the news of this revolt aurived in Eugland -there has been, or will have been by the end of this month, despatched to India a force of all arms consisting of 31,000 men. This number includes no recruits of the East India Company, but it does include 4,000 men of thez Queen's regiments who wereat Chatham, but who are not to be styled recruits. They are as thoroutghly formed soldiers. as any one of the regiments that have gone out. They will, it is true, go to fill up the complement of the corps. already in India, yet they will form a sabstantial addition. to the force available for the suppression of the mutiny. This large army will reach its destination at a season whon operations can be undertaken immediately and prosecnted without intermission. That season, as I am informed,though, perhaps, the noble earl is better acquainted with thi. mattex-isthe one best seited for military operations^; and I believe preparations will be made, to an extent never be fore known, to bring the whole of this force into the. most rapid, most a*tive, and most useful aervice. I concur with the noble earl as to the noeeity of procuring an adequate number of rewruits at home to fill Up vacancies in that force; and in order to keep up the strength of the regiments which have gone out, we hive called upon our recruiting agents in the frt place to raise ten new battalions of 800 men each, which will give us 8,000men; in the seoond place, to rase all the regiments not in India, but in the oolonies and in this country, to 1,000 strong; and thirdlj, to raise all the regi' Inenut in India to 1,200 atroug, with a view to provide against casualties. I grant that there wll be a heay demand on this country in order to fill lop the rank of the reginments in India . The noble earl's calulatioi ar I think, not beyond the masrl; and when he says that we shall require 15, 000 men toprovidefor caulties ocourringiL India, I may add 5,000 more for tho easalties eomnaon to the army at home. I believe that duing the continuLte of the trontbles in Indis we shall require at least 20,000 me a-year to be raised to replacthe cawualtieslappening in that country andathome.

I HOUSE OF COMMONS, FRiDAY. AUGUST 14. 'DIVORCE AND MATRIDONIAL CAUSES iPT'T -.T. The SPEAxxa took the chair at 12 o'clock. The House went again into committee on thls Bill, reseining the oonsideration of the 25th clause, which gives the v;lfe a right of divorce in certain caes, at the point where it was left off on the preceding day. 3;ord J. WANNERS said, he rose tomsnove the insertion of certain words with the view to carry out a principle which he had endeavoured yesterday to bring beMore the committee He would assume, for the sake of argument, that the deliberate opinion of that House was, that marriage ought to be dissolved on the ground of adultery; and, further, that, so far as the principle was cowc cerned, marriage ought to be dissolved on the score of adultery both at the suit of the man and of the woman. Another priDniple, if he might so call it, which the committee had decided, and which they were therefore hound to respect, was that although, as a matter of abstract right it could not be asserted that a woman ought to be placed in an inferior position to a nan with respect to divorce on the ground of adultery, yet there were certain social consldera. tions which ought to bar her claim. A third principle estab lished by the committee was, tbat the relief to be afforded to a wife was not to be left to the discretion of any court of law, bat was to be specifically laid down in the Act in connexion with each particular cam. The question then arose whether the causes which thev had already includod in the clause as justifying a claim of divorce on the part of a wife really exhausted the whole category of offences which when combined with adultery ought to be held as valid grounds of divorce. In his opinion they did not, and he wished to caU attention to one Case which had hitherto been entirely overlooked. He thought that the majority of the cases which the committee had al. ready deliberated upon and decided might be said, speakiu generally, to affect more yarticularly the higher snd wealthier classes of society. -he now desired to direct th attention of the committee downwards, and to ask them tP consider the position and, claims of women in the humbler ranks of life. A poor woman had a husband who committed adultery. Either previous or subsequent to the cominission of that offence he rendered himself amenable to the laws of the country by the perpetration of some other grievous crime, such as burglary or forgery. The committee had already decided tbatr in point of principle, the poor woman had A right to claim divorce from her offending husband, and he contended that there was no social consideration which could operate against and not in favour of her title to relief. Supposing the hasband were condemned to Penal servitude for life, in what position would thewife be placed ? The natural protector of herself and her children was removed from her; she could not expect to receive from him a single sixpence for her and their support; sho could nob by law marry again, bht was thrown hopeless and resourceless upon the vorld. He maintained that any woman so circumstanced ought to be per. mitted to marry again, in order that she might by that means procure the means of subsistence for herself and her children. In Franee, Sicily, the Canton de Vaud, Holland, Austria, and Prussia relief was granted to a -wife on the condemnation of heu husband to any infamous punishment, without the commision of adultery. WVhat was them in the state of society or of law in England to prevent them doing the same justice to the poor woman whose case he had put before the committee ? The noble lord concladed by moving the insertion of the following words :-" Or of adultery preceded or followed by the commission of a crime for which the husband is sentenced to penal servitude." Sir G. GREY was sorry that no notice nad been given of this sniendment, because it involved a new and important principle, which ought to be carefully considered. e unde,stood from the speech of the noble lord, though the terms of his arcendment conveyed a different notion, that, if a man were convicted of any offence and sentenced to a punishment which involved forcible separation from his wvfo, the latter would be entitled to ask for the dissolution of the bond of matrimoony in order that she might nmrry again. Now, a man minght commit burglary or forgery, and yet e faithful to his marriage vow. He supposed, therefore-and the amendment of the noble lord was plait upon the point-that there must be adultery- but surely, the noble lord did not mean to say tiat if a ny period of his married life a man committed adulter, and at some future time incurred the sentence Of penal servitude, his wife should be etitiled to a divorce although the previous act of adultery might have occurei zXood;r kgo whp ot were, ot iniglt even have bee con. doned 7 It seemed to him that the amendment joined things which had no natural connexion whatever. Those offences whilchthecornitteehadReady adopted as suffioientgroands for the dissolution of mnarriagevwhenoombined with adultery were offences -which involved * flagrant violation of the marriage vow; but, in the case;put by the noble lord, there wasnothingof the kind. Agamn, the noble lord assumed that the sentence of penal servitude necessarily imaplied the forcible separation of husband and wife for the vhole period of the sentence, and he understood the proposition of the noble lord to be, that any sentence of penal servitude passed by a judge should, without the decree of any court, carry with it a dissolution of marriage. Nov, a man might be convicted by a jury and sentenced to a term of penal servitude, and yet the Secretary of State might afterwards seefit, at the instaneof the judge, and upon further inquiry, either to commute cthe sentencs into a short period of imprisonment, or grant a free pardon to the prisoner. It might happen, therefore, if the mere sentence of the judge were to carry with it actual divorce a vfnculo meo-nis, that the man mi ht be at libexty a few days or weeks after the sentence had been passed, divorced from his wife and free to marry again. Was the noble lord prepared, after contending against the dirsolubility of marriage, to sanction such an extension of divorce as was involved in the amendment he had proposed ? He trusted the noble lord would not persist in his proposition, or that he would at least take another opportunity of proposing It when more notice had been given. Mr. HENLEY had not understood the noble lord in the same sense as the right hon. gentleman the Home Secre. tary. The noble lord's argument was that, as desertion was maade a ground for granting divorce to the wife, a forced absence in consequence of the sentence of a court should have the same effect. The question was one well worthy of consideration. Mr. GLADSTONE had been rather surprised that the committee had not perceived that in the proposition of the hon. and learned member for Knaresborough, to include murder and manslaughter among the grounda for granting divorces, a very important principle was involved. Tho aoiendnment of the noble lrdT was based rpon the same principles, and were he obliged to pronounce an opinion at oncs it would be adverse to the proposition. (Helar.) He would, however, recommend the noble lord to adopt the suggestioa of the Secretaxy of State and withdraw the amendment for the present, and if, after consideration, he should think it advisable to propose it he could do so upon the report. Although the committee had been makcing most material alterations in the clauses, and extending tha cate!ories under which a 'wife might present a petition for a divorce, yet all those extensions had reference to one principle-that the additions to be made to adultery as a ground for divorce to the wife should be additions whch in tbeir nature and character were offences sgainst the marriage contract. (Hear, hear.) He thought it would not be wise nor safe to go beyond that principle, and he hoped the noble lord would at least take more time to consider his amendment. Lord LOVAINE was not inclined to go beyond the principles stated by the right hon. gentleman. He wished to call attention to an anonymous letter contained in the papers which had been laid before the other House, but not before that House. The insertion of such a letter was most unusual, and might lead to very inconvenient results. Sir G. GREY explained that the papers referred to had not been presented to that House because they were not tdeesned to be necessary, and the commissioners entertaining the same opinion had n ot appended them to their report. Mr. HOPE said, if the amendment were Mdopted, the case of a man who had been convicted and received a ticket-ofleave, and found upon his return to this country that his wfe had married again, mnight frequently oceur. The law would then be pretty muxch the same as in Sweden. According to that law, if a man was for a certain number of years absent from his wife she might marry again; but if he afterwards came back the second husbandL must retire unless an agreement werO made to the contrary. ( laugh.) Sir W. EEATHCOTE reminded the hon. member for Maidstone that a distinctive feature of his noble friend's amendment was that the desertion should be accompanied with adultery, and that therefore such a case as he had referred to could not occur. Mr. MALINS thought they should be careful to confine the right of divorce in this instance to cases where adultery was commi4ted, and where abandonment of the wife took place in connexion with that adultery. (Hear, hear.) The right hon. baronet had statedthat thereport of Mr. M'Queen was not appended to the report of the commissioners, but it was impossible it could bave been so, as Mr. MiQueen's paper was not published till nearly three years after the report of the commissioners, This important document, prepared by Mr. ?d'Qneen, after careful an wry m France, was ordered to be printed by the House of Lords, and by that means it bad got into the hands of many hon. members; but surely if it was of importance that the House of Lords should have such a paper it wa equslly so to the members of that House, and he was therefore surprised that the Government had not taken steps to have it printed anad lid on the table. Sir G. GREY said, the document to which the hon. and learned gentleman referred was the compilatien of a private lndividual with which the Government had nothing to do, and they were not called on to produce it to the House. It was laid on the table of the House of Lords on the motion of a member of that House, not by the Government. Rle must say that he did not attach the same value to Mr. r Queen's report-teeing it waa a punely private paper, tat he on.and learned gentleman did, nor did he think Iit was one which the Government should have produced to Inlauence the decisions of Parliament. Mr. MALINS only wished to say that if the document was useful to the discussion of this Bill in the House of Lords it must be equally so in the House of Commons, and he thought it was the duty of the Government to have pro. duced it. Lord PALMERSTON thought that seeing the. hon. and learned gentleman attached so much importance to this document he ouaght to have moved for Ite production. Mr. MALINS reminded the noble lord that it was not till the end of July they were informed of the intention of Government to proceed with this Bil He might besid s plead professional engagements as a reason why he did not move for the production of this paper, which he stil be. lieved it was the daty of the Government to have laid on the table. lb Mr. DE VERB was opposed to this Bill on'prucil '- as he believed it not only rested cn no religious sanction, tut was opposee to all religious sanctions, and would be injirnous to the domestic peace and morality of this country. Ee could noe give his assent to any amendments calculated to extend the area within ,vhich the provisions of the Bi I were to apply; nor could he be a party to amendmnents which might be proposed merely to lessen the chance of the Bil pasaing into a law. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the particular amendment before the House, as one fact was worth a thousand arguments, he would mention the case which had occurred vwithin his own exprience. One was the case of a man in the higher walks of life, and the other that of a mn in a humbler sphere Both had been capitally convicted, but had their sentences conlmutedto transportation, and, after the lapse of many yeara, they both returned to their wives and families, and were now living in the enjoyment of domestic peace. (Hear, hear.) Lord J. MANNEIS had found it physically impossible to put his amendment on the paper, and must say he had enough to do to consider one clause after another as ic arose. Lord J. MANNERS said he would withdraw his amend. ment, but be hoped that the Government would take the subject into their consideration before tho report was brought up. Mr. STEUART expressed a similar hope. hlr. N3EWDEGATE complained of the dictatorial tone which the noble lord at the head of the Government had gradually assumed towards the committee. It had been deeply felt by many hon. members last night, but it would not prevent those who took an interest in the subject giving the= s of the BiU their most careful attention, and even studled opposition when it was necessary. But a few da ago the noble lord called upon the House to pass the Bi3 for the consolidation of the criminal law withoat examination, although it had been shows that it coatained very important alterations and variations from the existing criminal lawv, and now be wanted them to pus this Bill, which 'was drawn up in almanner unworthy of the learnng of those who were responsible for it, merely because it had come down late in the session. Mr. COLLLNS hoped that the Bill would not pass into law without some provision being introduced giving divorce in cases of aggravated felony, coupled with the commission of adultery. The amendment was then withdrawn. Mr. STAPLETON thought that these amendments extending relief to the wife required one addition to make them as nearly perfect as possible. and he therefore moved the insertion of words entitling a woman to a divorce for "adultery oommitted after she has obtained a decree for restitution of conjugal rights." Sir G. GREY said that in such a case a woman would in effect have married the man twice over, and he therefore did not see how she was entitled to greater facilities for obtaining a divorce. hlr. BUITT suggested that, although she had obtained a decree, the husband might never have conformed to it. Mr. GLADSTONE said that on the previows evening they had experienced great didiculty in findixg words which would meet casas in which there might be all the animus and substance of desertion, but in which the hus. band by certain occasional proceedings of his own might provent his wife proving the offence according to the legal and teohnical meaning of the word. He thought that this amendment would, to a considerable extent, although perhaps not altogether supply that defect in the olause. Aco cording to it the sufastanco of the desertion wvould ha asoertained by the suit for restitution of conjugal rights, and adultery following this would entitle the wife to a diverse. Sir G. GREY urged that as the amendment Btooed although a man might live 'with his wife for 20 years after the decree had been pronounced, yet a single act of adultery commi'tted at the expiration of that period would render him liable to be divorced. Mr. STAPLETON thought that there would be no injus tice in such a provision. It was only a similar case to that of indicting a felon for a previous conviction a nuaiber of wears before. Lord PALMERSTON said that the word " desertion" In the clause implied that the desertion should subsist on the partof thehuaband, whereas the amendment wvas baed upon the asmption that the desertion had ceased. Now, whether the desertion had ceased volantarily upon the part of the husband, or in consequence of^ a decree of the court ddnot the leatsignify, and as soonasthe pafries came together again the desertion and all the incidents conneoted with it ceased, so that the practical effect of the amendment would be to allowa divorce on the ground of adultery Mr. AYRTON said that the words in the clause were "desertion without reasonable excuse." Now, it appeared to him that it would be better to leave the word ' deer. W.on to and alone, and at the end of the olaue to intro- duce some definition of the meaning of the word desertion. As the word at present stood, it woald apply only to leaving a wife without tho mneaus of support, whereas he believed it was intended to apply to the more general sense of a man's deserting his marital daties. Mr. HENLEY agreed with the noble lord that when the parties had come togother again, whether voluntarily or whether in accordance with a judicial decree, the desertioa and the incidents connected with it were at an end. The amendment was withdrawn. Sir W. HIETE1OOTE, proposed to add, as an explanation of the term "bigamy," the words, "that bigamy shall be taken to mean the marriage of any person being already married to any other person during the lifetime of the former husband or wife." Sir G. GREY would be glad if the hon. baronet would not at present press the amendment, as he should like to take the opinion of his learned friend the Attorney-General with rogard to it. Sir W. HEATHCOTB assented, and withdreow the amendment. Mr. BUTT then proposed an amendment, the effect of which was that if any of the felonies mentioned in the Lct as a ground for divorce were alleged against a husband, in the case where such felony should have been comritted in England it would be necessary to prove a conviction, or that the man had been outlawed upon an indictment charging him with such offence. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL, who had just entered the House a few miantes before, and who was cheered on returning to his plaem, said he was sorry he conld not congratulate the committee on the progress they had made with the Bill dcuing his absence. (A laugh.) Not only had they not been progressing, but they had in reality made a retrograde movement. (Laughter.) The hon. and learned gentleman was proceeding to speak to the amendment, when he was interrupted by The CHAIRMA2, who decided that it was substantially similar to one which had already been discussed and disposed of by the oommittee, and therefore could not be put. On the question being put from the Chair that clause 25, as amended, stand part of the Bill, Mr. GLADSTOTE said,-I do not intend to take the sense of tho committee on this clause, though I should join with any hon. member who might think it his duty to do Eo. I am contented with the decision which was originally taken on the motion of my hon. friend the member for West Sarrey (Ur. Drummond), althouggh I entertain the strongest conviction that if we were now to proceed to a di. vision again which should fairly raise the question of the wife's equality, thongh the committee would not in that respect reverse its former decision, the proportion of the numbers ou the division would be most materially altered by tho course which onr discussions have taken on this clause. (Hear, hear.) At present the matter stands thas,-that my noble friend at the head of the Government thought fit to make a charge of obstruction against those who had been engaged in discussing the details of this clause, and the few words which I shall now say will be said with the intention, not of making an accsation against anybody, but of removing, if possible, from the minds of those who think that charge was justified the impression they entertain, and also the sentiment that we are greatly aggrieved by that accusation. By noble friend made that charge when at midnight he found that we had been engaWed for 10 hoars in discussing the details of this claue. The exact foundation of the charge vas that we had come to tho end of the clause, that nothing remained to be done but to take the sense of the committee on the question that it do pass, and that therefore it was an unwarrantable proceeding to move that you should report progress. That motion, however, was miot made by an opponent of the Bill, but by a friend of the BiU thwn ,who is not now in his place. My noble friend was entirely mistaken as to the immediate grounds of the charge, for so far from having then disposed of aU the points which had arisen on the consideration of the clause, wo have nearly spent other two hours this morning in amending it, and chiefly on the invitation of gentlemen who are friendly to the BilL (Hear, hear.) Now, what I want to bring to your minds is this --The real question between us is whether the Bill that we are now discussing is or is not a BiU which from its nature requires minute and detailed scrutiny and strict investigation. (Hear, hear.) That is reaUy the question between us; and, for myself, I say frankly that I may have sdd foolish things during these discussions, but I have not said ono word purposely except what I believe was called for by the Bill on its own merits. Well, is it true that yesterday was spent by the committee without profit? (Cheers.) We have here been discussing the most difficult and complicated parts of a most difficult and complicated subject. (Hear, hear.) If you had admitted the principle of divorce in the case of the woman as well as in that of the mian this part of the operation would have been simple. I hold in my hand a communication from a genxtleman who is ackmow. ledged to be one of the highest authorities on the subiectnamely, Mr. M2Qacen, who, after disposing of the principle of the Bill, on coming to the question of the right of divorco to be given to the woman, says here the real diffioulties of the Bill commence, and then he enters into a minute examination of the question of these cases. This is a clause which contains important and difficult matters sufficient to occupy this House for days and weeks. (Cheers.) It embraces the whole principle of the BiU as regards at least one-half of the human race-namely, women, and forms a cede of itself as respects the rights of women under the law of divorce. What are the signs of obstructed prooeedings ? The repetition of the sme proposals is instanced, but I am not avare that the same proposals have been repeated by persons opposed to the BilL There has been a few minutes ago an accidental case of that kind certainly, but it was only accidentaL Have the proposals which have been made one after another been condemned by the general sense of the committee ? I have rarely Imown a harder day's work done in the House of Commons than was done by the committee yesterday. (Cheers.) We disposed of no less than eighl or ten most difficalt and important questions of law, and so far from those being proposals condemned by the committee, compare the clause as it now stands w.ith the clause as it originally came into our hands. (Cheers.) The clause, as it firat came before us, contained four categories under which the wife might present a petition; three of them remain nearly or altogether as they were; one relating to bigamy bas been fundamentally altered; and tbree new categories, making seven in all, were one after another introduced into the clause and with the unanimousassent of the committee. (Cheers.) Now, in the discussion in committee on the Oxford YUniversity Bill, which was about the same length as this, but certainly not of greater importance or difficulty, I believe -we were occupied not less than from 25 to 30 nights (cheers), and there were oocasions during the discusons on that BiU on which we found, after spending six or eight hours, that we had not advanced above a line and half; but we never presnmed to say to my right hon. friend opposite (Mr. Disraeli) and to those who a*ted with him on that side of the House that they were abusing their privilege as members of Parliament, and offering obstructions to an important measure under the oonsideration of the House. (Erear, hear.) This is a matter in which the difficalties are inherent in the case under the crcumstances in which we are caUed on to discuss this BilL (Cheers.) My noble friend at the head of the Government said at one period of the discussion on the Bill, " We sball sit here until September if you like." But let me assure my noble friend that we have not eudeavoured to delay the Bill by any factions opposition. We complained, on the contrary, of the Bill beimg put off, because we saw the difiiculty of discussing it under the circnmstances become greater and greater. If the committee think the Bil shonld pass withoutt minute examination of its details, let them say so, for tha% would relieve and discharge a considerable number of hon. members altogether. I know at least that it would be an immense relief to me. Looking to the advanced period of the season, I dare say the practioe as regards divorce among the members of this House has began already (a laugh); for many of us aeo detained here under circumstances which I fear bring us under the category of being for the present divorced 2 mensde e thoro. (Laughter.) Unless, therefore, my noble friend can procure us some absolution that we should allow this BQi to pass without aminute examination of its detaiLq. we have really no choice but to attempt to bring his Bill into theobest possible shape. The Attorney-General has expressed an opinion that there will probably be some further legislation on this sabject, and that this Bill is not to be "the be-all and end-all" of the question, There are many of us-not only of those who voteT against the second reading of the BiL but likewise of those who, like my noble friend the member for London, give a mnost eavnest support to the BiUl on its principle-wbo think and feel most strongly that it is our duty not to aim at what is called finalit, of which human laws do not admit, but to give something like body, dearness, sense, consistency, and inteUigibility to the code of which we are going to lay the foundation. it has been our absolate duty in considering all these most difficult questions with regard to the woman, to veascomplete and consistent effect to the principle embodied in the clause, and which we thought most inadequately carried out, as we could possibly give to it. .For that reason we have deliberated 10 or 12 hounrs and still, althaough we understand the principle of the clause, I feel doubtful whother there are not casesgross and painful cases-cases too painful to be named- n over and above the mere act of adultery oharac. tenized in the strongest terms in the report of the commissioners, and striking directly at the marriage contract and the peace and comfort of the wife-for which in the clause we have made no provision whatever. (Hear, hear,) If I have been desirous that this Bill should not pass in the present session, it has been upon + .e ground that I do not believe it can be made a work worthy of this House in the short time which remains to us; bht I have not on account of that opinion descended to the wretched art of spinning speeches about nothing in order to 'waste the time of the House. (Hear, hear.) On the contrary, I have declined to enter into personal questions, and have forborne to accept challenges of that nature. Ia that spirit I shall continue to act. I hope I have said nothing upon the present occ-i sion to give offence to my noble friend at the head of the Government or to anybDdy else. My desire is that a sense of wrong should be removed from one side or the other, and that we should now ascertatn whetherwe are to continue to discharge our duties as members of Parliament by a minute examination of this Bill or not. I think we have passed the most difficult part of the BilL The next five or sixc clauses may undoubtedly give rise to points of importance, but after these clauses are over I should hope that we may proceed rapidly to that clause, the 53d, upon which questions of great moment will he raised, which it mast be the desire of us all to have settled without unnecssary delay. (Hear, hear.) Lord PALU7ERSTON.-I can assure my right hon. frienad tnat there is nobody in this House who would regret more than I should do the having expressed in regard to other persons any opinion as to the course which they may think proper to pursue in discharge of their duty as members of Parliament. It is quite true that things which I have heard out of this Houns, and some things which I have observed in this House, did lead me to think that there *as oh the part of the opponents of the Bill an intention, if they could not defeat it by divisions, so far to protrat tb4 di#se ons ag to it poi oiw Q Bill to pass this year. That was the impression created upon my mind. It very likely was an erroneous itnpres. sion, and, after what the right hon. gentleman bag stated, I am bound to say that, in regard to hi?n especially, that impression must have been erroneous. (Hear, bear.) With respect to the Bill itselS, I can only say that we are quite conscious of its importance. We have no desire to hurry the House improperly through the measure, or to prevent ample and full consideration of all matters to which it relates. go far from complaining of full discussion, or of amendments proposed in a spirit of improvement, we should be sincerely thankful to those who may afford us the means of improving a measure which we think of importance, and which we desire to pass in as perfect a form as possible. (Hlear, hear.) We felt that this BUi having originated in the other House of Parliament, having been discussed at great length by all those learned men belonging to the law who are members of that House, there was at least primed facie evidence that the Bill was properly framed and not liable to serioos objections. (Hear, hear.) Bat, subject to that, I can assure my right hon. friend that I vould be the last man to coinplain of any amendments which may be proposed iu a spirit of improvement, and not for the mere purpose of producing delay. I trust, therefore, that hon. gentlemen ill aquit me of any wish to obstructe the full and free deliberation of the House upon a measure which, so far from desiring to pass hastily, we hope may receive the amplest consideration and amendment, (cheers.) Mr. GLADSTONE.-I thank my noble friend for what he has said, and shall take the liberty of adding only one word. I am afraid that a remark which fell from myself afforded some ground for the impression he entertained, and I should lke to explain the circumstances, though I am rather reluctant to do so in the absence of the right hon. baronet the niember for Droitvich. When the right hon. baronet was oonversing with the noble lord across the table as to the day when his motion for a commission on the subject of education might be brought before the House. I cried out ia an idle jest, " Fix it for the Greek Kalends." I can assure my noble friend that when I used that expression I mainlv referred to my seneo of the objections which I thought would lie against calling upon this House at this period of the session to discuss the question whether we should address the Crown to issue a commission upon education. (Hear, hear.) Mr. HENLEY.-I think the committee is perfectly satisfied with what the noble lord has said, and, notwithstanding vwhat we were told in the first instance, that he who ran might read, I imagine the noble lord must now see that this Bill reuies to be sifted and discussed in every clause and ne. (Hear. hear, Numerous important amendments have already been mtroduced into it, in a great majority of cases with the consent of those wbo have charge of the Bill, and I hope, therefore, that we shall hear no more of the charge that we are not taking a fair and honest course. (Elear, hear.) The ATTORNEY-GENRL.-In justice to the noble lord at the head of the Government, I beg the committee to recollect that nobody ever used the expression that "he who runs might read the BiL" The words that unforttnately f rom me were something very different, and hare been greatly mnisrepresented. What I said was,-" The intentions of the Government re in the Bill, and he who reads may understandthem." (A laugh.) I hope that we shall nowlet bygones be bygones. (Hear, hear.) If I were to recollect all the hard taunts I received yesterday I should regard them, when combined with the various amendments which were proposed, as very " agravating circumstances" indeed. (A Lugh.) Let us now, however, in that spirit of improvement which I believe exists on both sides of the House, proceed with the Bill as expeditiously as possible. (Hear, hear.) Lord J. MANNERS inquired whether it was the intention of the Government, under the new system to be established by this Bill, to prohibit women from having recourse to the House of Lords ; and also, if it was not their intention to do so, but to carry out the recommendation of the coinmnisaoners, in what way it was proposed that application to the Legislature should be made. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL assured the noble lord that there was nothing in the Bil to affect the future authority of Parliament. The right of a wife under aggravated circumstances, not provided for in the' BiU to Apply to the Legislature for a divorce, would remain wholly unaffected. Mr. GLA.DSTONB had intended to have raised that question at somae stage of the discussion. Much alarm had been created by certain words which feU from the Attorney. General, to the effect that the Bill was not the be-all and the end-all of legislstion. He (Mr. Gladstone) hoDed he was juastified in putting a limited construction upon that expression, and that the hon. and learned gentleman meant to say that he contemplated as possible new remedies for the woman might, from time to time, be entertained by the House of Lords. If that werna the intention of the hon. and learned gentleman no objection could be taken, as those new remedies would be natural and inevitable from the ilrfect manner in which they Were Lt present legislating. Mie did hope it was not intended to hold out a prospect Wat new causes of divorce, opening new prineiples, were likely to be introduced by the House of Lords. The ATTORNEY-GENER&L reminded the committee that when he made the observation which was supposed to bear the interpretation that the right hon. gentleman had mentioned he was suggesting the propriety of confiniag these discussions to the limited field covered by the Bill, without attempting to define the existing law. It was in ansv er to the argument that the existing law did not do full justice to the woman that he used the expression that the ilU if passed need not be the end-all of legislation upon the subject, He said that, not as indicating any intention on the part of the Government to make the marriago law a subject for fursher legislation, but as pointing out the fact that if the oondition of woman should afterwards be found to require further legislative interference there would be nothing to prevent that further interferenoe. As to what the House of Lords would do, the Government, of course, would not p resume to dictate to that body - but if the House of Lords was true to itself, and should Woide by the rules by which it had hitherto been governed, there would be no room for application to them for divorce on the part of wives, because aU the existing causes of interference hitherto recognized by the House of Lords were embodied in the Bill, and even more than those grounds. At the same time, he could not presume to say what the House of Lords in its wisdom might think fit to do upon future occasions. Lord J. BUSSELL-I have heard with much satisfaction the declartion which has just been made by the AttorneyGeneral. Of course it was never preteuded there was to ba finality in legislation, and I do not say that the House of Commons may not at some future time think fit to adopt the Scotch law of divorce or any other principle which may seem to them at that time to be most conducive to the benefit of the country. Bat what did alarm me vas that the Attorney-General seemed to Imply that the Government wMich has brought forward this BilL and asked us, if not to change the legislation at least very much to vary the pri. ciples of law which have hitherto governod us in respect to divorces-the Government of which ha was the organ, declared this was not to be the end-all, but that they intended in some foture session to propose some further measure upon this highly important subject. I thought that was alarming, as tending noti only to introduce instability into our legislation, bat to instil false ideas into the minds of all who have entered or were about to enter into the holy state of matrimony. I am glad to find that no such meaninR was intended to be conveyed. (" Hear," from the Attorney-U eneral) Admitting, as we must do, that the statement of the Lord-Advocate is one of the greatest importance, and that it may be possible that Parliament will adopt the principle which he tells us experience has shown to he so good in Scotland, it is not intended by the Government to carry in a future seesion any measure going beyond the present BilL I think the committee are very much indebted to the noble lord (J. Manners) for the amendment which he proposed yesterday, aud which seems to me to change the whole complexion of the clause and to make the lawto resemble more the Code 1fapdeonthe agreement come to by the Council of State presided over byNapoleon, and which comprised some of the greatest Prench lawyers. That I conceive to be a great improvement in the law. As to any cases which may hereafter come before the House of Lords upon the petition of the husband or the wife for divorce in particular instances, I think we may safely leave them to the discretion of that tribunaL That House comprises the Lord ChanceUor, the Lord Chief Justice, and other eminent and learned personages, as well as the archbishop and bishops, who would represent the opinion of the church, and I do not think they are likely to undertke a case of divorce without some very good grounds, or that they believe it to be a case separate fromrthe ordinary prindples of legislation requiring their interference. Such casesmightnot occurmore thanonceor twice in a century, but when they do the Elouse of Lords can dealwiththemastheymaythink proper. Iamgladtofindthat the h eat which prevailed at one time has passed away, and that the Government have discovered that those who entered upon minute criticism of the clauses of this Bill were only purinog a legitimate course of action. I think there were twro courses to he adopted,-.one was to say, "It is too late in the session to bring ir this Bill " and the other, that "This rs a Bill of such great importance that we must discuss minutely eVery clause of the BilL." There miiht have been, 'meedo, another course, and it might bave been slid by the Govermment, " We ;re determined to have this Bill, but as it is so late we cannot discuss it;" but such a course would not have been defensible. I trust that in the further progress of this Bill we shall have no captious objections taken (and I do not think there have beeu any), and, on the other hand, I hope the Government will be disposed to discuss any amendments in the same spirit of candourin which those amendments will be proposed. (Hear, hear.) Mr. NAPIER sid the clause as it stood would leave a large class of persons, many of them of the humblest class, without any remedy except that of applying to the House of Lords. This would lead to future discussion and agitation of the question, which they would all deplore. They had got into these difficulties by not adopting the simplicity of the Scotch law. Clause 25, as amended, was then agreed to. On clause 26, which provides that the adulterer shall be a co-respondent, and that cauacs may be tried by a jury, Mr. PULLER rose to move amendments whiah wouid apply to this and the 31st clause, his object being to ralse the question whether the offence of adultery should be punishable only with fine, as now proposed in the BillW or whether it was not expedient to impose the heavier punsh irent of imprisonment. (Eear.) The oene would perceive that tho Bill took a chronological view of what was to be done in carrying out its main provisions. Clause 25 id down what were to be regarded as grounds of divorce. Clause 26 stated who were to be the parties to a suit. The next two clauses pointed out what the court was to havo proved or disproved, and then proceeded to sho vw hat relief could be given to the parties, Clause 31 armed the ourt with the power of punishing the adulterer with fie. Now, what he proposed was, that every party brought before the court who old wb ptroved, to the satisfaction of a jury , to have been guIt of adultery should be liable to be punished by fine or impaeonment, or by fine and impris3nmenit, abad thWs p Cak i woul mike applicable both izn cas of dissolutionof marriage and lrthoe of judi" 116 To efcthsojchewoulgdopc_ to rebiddel dn~~ and 31 in a way which heho would be satisfactory tot House, so that the effect would be to jpiake an parties f'J a unilty of adultery punishable in the way he had sun%"., If the commxittee made the wife punishable she lmud b made a co-respondent to the petition, and in ma by aes1t would be greatly for the advantage of her eharacter thashe should be placed in that position. This was an inol, tiou 'whicha naual oloe rm the changes whichwes,e, made by this Bill in in ths stai. Adultery wsnow, for tbe first time' during the last *O,i years-with the exception of the abort reign of the Puritaid* -made a crime punishable by the State. By the Bill as it;. stood only the adulterer who had committed adult,ey With; a married woman had been made subject to punishment. the wife who had disgraced her husband's home, who hadX abandoned her children, and the husband who had added to. adultery incest, cruelty, and felony were left untonched. The Bill gave them divorce, but in most cases it was a boorb rather than a punishmentt. The only person who wasy, punished under the Bill was the adulterer who committed, adultery with a maarried woman, and he ws only punished) by a pecuniary fine, the lightest and the least disgfacef of, all punishmaents known to our law. And yet the crlm&i of adultery stood in the Decalogne between murder ancb theft, and by the majority of the people was regarded witek greater abhorrence than the lightest class of thefts. Property was protected by the law in every way, bnt the institttotn of marriage was entirely unprotected, The puniah. ment imposed by the Bti on the person comnitting adulter with a nnarred woman was a fine, but the effect of this, would be fine for the rich and imprisonment for the r,-ab circumstance which would not tend to make the Brempt- able to the people. It was obiected that if adultery in thee wife were made punishable by imprisonment the husbancu would be unwilling to sue for a divorce; but it was absurd to. say that when a husband had made up his mind to expose, his wife to the infamy of having her sin published to the. world he would draw back from the fear of seeing her imprisoned. The real reluctance to pass this clause arose from, the reluctance to run the risk of sending to prison, to live upon prison fare, to wear prison dress, and to associate with common criminals women oLt' high birth, conrtly mannerg, and luxurious habits. If punishment wereregarded'merely ss a retribution, theloseof ome, of children, and of position might be qtLite suolcient, but as a means of prevention something more wasrequired. The House was siow legislating, not ioly forla ies and gentlemen, but for the middle and it might bethe labournng classes of England, and in the name of tbee virtuonsly.educated girls of this country he askedthat thee law should be made what it ought to be, a sbield and a defence against the temptations "f the senses. The imposition. of a punishment would act not enly to deter women trom. committing adultery, but also to deter men from solicitinP them, because society would cry shamne with a volce muc& louder than that with whick it now spoke gat a man. who, to gratify his own passions, persuaded a woman to placeo herself in peril of imprisonment. The resronsIbility wae' thsownuponthecommitteetodecidewhbthertheywouldleave' husbands and wives wholly unrestrained by law, or whetherthey would do what they could to prevent the crime, Extending, as they did by this Bill, the facilities of divore. they ought at the same time to take additional precautiousm agamist collusion, and what better defence againdthatcaulds there be than bringing every person implicatedintheoffenoge before the court, making each of them liable to punishment, and thus giving to all of them a direct interest in bringluL the truth, and the whole truth, before the court? If the. Bill passed in its present shape a married woman, the respected mother of a family, might be convicted of adultery upon a collusive suit, without either herself or her husbandi having any knowledge of the proceedings, and might haveno resource but writing a letter to The Times to protest her innocence. The hon. gentleman concluded by moving bis first amendmedt to omit the words " presented by the husband," and to insert " or any petition for a decree of indidli separation on account of adultery." Mr. HENLBY should not follow the hon. and learne& gentleman into his rather irregular discussion of the 31st;. clause. Setting aside that section, there were otherreasonin why this clausere9uiredamendmeat. The clause, a8 itetood, was entirely one-sided. The Bill provided that a husbaud. should have a remedy against the wife for simple adultery, and the adulterer, by the presentclause, was to be made aoorespondent to the petition, and the guilt of the wife and heralleged paramour to be tried by a jury, But what was. the case if a wife petitioned for a divorce against her husband, and the offence alleged against the husband mut be, not adultery alone, but adultery under aggravated circumstances ? Wby, there was no proviaion made for m- cin the alleged paramour of the husband a co-r ,detsnan having the case tried by a jury; but, as the B' stood, an. innocent woman might be aleged by a wife to be her husband's paramour, the case might be tried in her absencea without her beiDg moade a party to the suit, and her character might be destroyed, while such an action would be. attended with all the scandal which at present disgraoed tbe'action for cinm con. (Hear, hear.) Could there be a greaterinstance of the carelessness and recklessne8s with whichb this Bill had been prepared ? (Hear, hear.) Why, one of the grounds on which the House was asked to support it wasthat it abolished the action of crin. con., and yet it imoparted into another action all the scandal of an acion for crim.. con.' (Rear, hear.) What he wished to know was whether the Attorney General would be prepared to intro- duce words into the clause which should place both partleeaon an equal footing. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL aia that he was very gla& the subject had been brought under the notice of the committee, because it was one of great difficulty and not to bee too hastily dealt with. By the clause the obligation wasthxown upon the husband of making the alleged parmourof his wife a co-respondent to the petition, and it was only under certain circamstances that he could be relieved from. that obligation. Now, a petition against the husban& would contain other allegations than that of adultery alone, and it was only in respect of the allegation of adultery" that the allegod paramour could be made a co-respondent. But then came another difficulty. Suppose the alleged' paramourof the husband was&a married woman, thenit was a question whether she could be made a co-respondentzs without her husband. For his owrn part, he deprecated multiplying difficulties in the way of an applicatlen by the, wife, She would have a gteat many difficulties already tocontend aganst. The husband had means at comman&d which she had not, and in many cases, also, it would be impossible to serve a notice upon tha alleged paramour of the. husband. It was true that in all cases the notice could boe served on the husband himself, but intehe event of his running away with X woman who had no known place of residence It would be impossible to serve notice upon her. If, therefore, an equal obligation were thrown upon both sides, the woman would be exposed to a greatamount of trouble and& expense which might unduly interfere to prevent application on the prtS of the rife. The court would, by the 50tbth section of the clause, have the power of laying down itsown mode of procedure upon the subject; but he'wouldL have no objection to frame a clause if the committoe should think that it rould be advisable t place the woman. upon the same footing as the msuan, the court, o cor8, having power to dispense with service of notices on the alleged paramour under special circumstances. The action for criminal conversation was to be superseded, entirely, aud therefore it 'as felt to be right to strip the-' court, where the husbaud complained of adultery, of ftie power of deciding on the facts, and to impose on it the obliEation of having the facts decided by a jury. The wife. might; complai of adultery with aggravated circumstances, and the question was whether the husband and the paramour of the husband should in all cases have the right of' requiring the facts to be proved before a jury It would be, but a truism to say that where a man's character was atstake he should, in the event of his being brought before a. judicial tribunal, have the right of having the matter investigated by a jury; but yet how great was the difficulty imsuch a case thrown on the wife ! The wife, though she ha&, been treated by her husband with the most aggravatedi cruelty, might have no means whatever at her own disposal of obtainng relief, and herconnexions might be destitute of' resources. If sbe applied for legal aid, a solicitor would probabl tell her that to obtainthe desiredredress she would have' to expend 3001 to 4001. If therefore the committee gave tho, husband the right of compelling the wife to substantiateher allegations before a jury they would throw impedimentsin the way of a detenceless and unprotected woman whicbin many cases might be the means of bafflin altogethertheir humane legislation in her favour. (Hear. The BiEi when before the House of Lords received many importantalterations. He ws snot aware what Iti state was when first;. resented to the House of Lords; but he had not thoughts St right to suggest any alterations in the clause forthe reasons he had given, t, however, the oommittee. desired a parity of procedure in the case of thewife, he should be most happy to throw the clause into thatshape. He wrould put a eas which mnight fequnently" happen. Suppose a wife applied for redress, produced her' own affidavits and the affidavits of her owrn maid-servant, who might have wvitnessed some of the grievous actt of' cruelty to which the wife had been subjected; and sup. pose, too, the adultery of the husband had been a notorione' thing and was easily capabble of proof. In that case, the husband might not file a single affidavit ins opposition, or contest any one of the *Ulegatigns made by the wilfe; yet if the committee wero to lay down the rle to which he hua referred the husbanau might;' say that those were al1 questions to be tried by a jury. That, he suzbmitted, wrould be a hard Case Sgsinst the wfife,. and, ashe had said, * seriousimpediment intheway olher, availing herself of the humane legislation wthich hod basis, passed int her favour. Mr. AYRTON said he had heard with great sjams. the statement of the Attorney-GeneraL The committee had now before them two distinct propo3il tions. The first was whether the adulterem shoUld. be brought before the oourt in any prooeeing to ba' instituted by the wife. On that point it appeared to bothe eneral opinion of the committee that in Eome case3 it.. wod be desrable to bring the adulteress before the Court, but that it should not be made compulsory on the wife tobring her before the court in all cases. He came, however, to the more important question of the two-namely, the' right of any person accused of an offence to demand to be' tried by a jury. The Attorney-General in this ease had. mggested that that right was to be qualified dmply on the, ground of expense. e (r. Ayrton) could not understand on what principle a prooedure was to be defended whichdirected that a man should be tried on aou ati vitll affecting his status in society without the intervention of am jury, simply on the ground of sving expense to the party who came forwrd to prefer these aocustions, (Hear,. hear.

LONDONV, SATURDAY, AUGUST 15, 17. In the House of Lords lest night, The Earl of ELLBtonBouOr asked the SWorAaRy for WAR what use he intended to make of the 200,0001. just voted in the Lowrer House for the embodiment of the Militi The noble lord then proceeded to review our position in Europe a regarded foreign Powera, and urged, eonsiderins3 the struggle in which we were now engaged inThdia, the necessity of embodying the whole of the Militia force. Lord PANMURE replied that it was intended to expend the 200,0001. voted by Parliament in embodying 10,000 of the Militia between this and the 25th of March next. If in the meantime that force were found to be insufficient, Parliament would have reassembled, and might provide for an additional force by a larger vote. After some further discussion, in which the Marquis of CLAxRrIARDE, Lord ELLBNBOLOUGB, and Lord GRANvL took part, the matter dropped. Several Bills were then forwarded a stage; after which their Lordships adjourned. The Honse of Commons, st the comrnencement of the morning sitting, resumed in Committee the consideration of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill at the 25th clause, which has been already so many hours under debate. Lord J. MaN-NBs moved to include, among the grounds of a wife's claim to a divorce, " adultery preceded or followed by the commission of a crime for which the husband has been sentenced to penal servitude." Sir G. GnxR opposed this amendment. The adultery, he observed, might have been condoned; the crinme which was to be the adjunct of adulterv might have no connexion with the mariage vow, and the sentence of penal servitude might be reversed or remitted. Mr. GLADSTONx acknowledged that he was adverse to the proposal, which after an hour's discussion was withdrawn. Mr. STAPLETocr proposed to add " adultery committed after the wife had obtained a decree in a suit for restitution of conjugal rights ;" but Sir G. GRzy objected, and this propos was, after some discussion, likewise withdrawn. Other proposed amendments led to the same reult. On the question that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill, Mr. GLADsToNx reviewed the protracted discusEion of its details, observing that this clause wa the real difficulty of the Bill, and he took ooccaion, referring to an observation of Lord PArMsaSTOlX in the debate of the preeding night, to repel the charge of offering an obstructive opposition to the measure. Lord PALr.ssoN confesed that he had boen led to think that on the part of the opponents of the Bill there was an intention, if tIey could not defeat it, to protract the discus3ion to as to prevent its pasing. Very likely, he added, this was an erroneous impression, and after what Mr. GLADsTonz had said he was bound to believe that it must have been erroneous. This acknowledgment, which was met in a reciprocal spirit by Mr. GLADnsToNE, imparted a milder tone to the debate, auathe 25t iitulhng0 agred to. * Onth tdus,hic} h enacsthtipea p.11. tion preeted by s hitibsad bie shal.-ke te aleged adulterer a W-resondet, unles ouwspWa grounds, fr. PuLZz, With the 'rw of maing dule6 a crime in ll se, proposed to roootruiet te cluse by enacing that upon any petition or tbe disolution of a m e, or for a dere of judieW tion on the Vund of adultery, the peron hwitll tho fe adutiyis alleged to bsvo beox . raitted "hll be made a co-respondent; intendig to follow up this amendment'by altering the MA so as to punish the adulteier or aduleres for a aniademeanour. fr. Hlmnzv oberved that the clause as it stod was one-sided, contemplating only a petition by the husband. The A=rorxr-GzNmaAL pointed out th danger of prejudicing the wife by allowing a parityof pro. ceeding; he suggested that the Court mlght be armed with authority to direct the paramor to be made a co-respondent, and he ead an m mxadment to that effect which he was prepared to make in the clause. Four o'clock apochin, the debate as susnded, sad the lutiny (Est lndia) B having been read a second time, and the Militia Pay Bi havin assed through comxittee, the dtting ter. In the evening, Mr. EsTcOURT, in moving that the Houe at Itg risng do adjourn until Monday, calld attention to the expediency of facilitating railway comrnuuiction between Great Britain and India by the route of the Euphrates. He urged the importice of this route in a cormmercial as wel as in a polltiad point of view ; that it was the most direct route to India. and that, compared with the Suez route, that by the valley of the Euphrates was ahorter by 90g mile. The next .quetio was, he observed, could it be done? e answered this question by tacing the course of the route, and rhowing by geographical details itf practicability to the Persian Gulf, and from Kurrachee to Mooltan, lahore, and Clcutta. The obstacle to the enterpriee he said, wasthe want of seourity. If he could not stisfy the House that this was a nationa object, he admitted that he had not a leg to stand upon; but if it was, as he contended, an-.udertaking of national importance, the Government of this country, he insited, ought to take care that itg advantages were not snatched from those who risked their capital in such an enterprise. The esimate and contract for the line of rail from the -Medlterranean to the Euphrate-10 mlles-ws 1I 00,0001., and the promoters sought to rais 1,400,000L, and the Turkish Government had already guaranteed 6 per cent. upou this outay. The subscribers, however, were distrustful, feaing interruption from political events, and wrhat he asked w,as not a guarantee, but an asurace that during its early year the underbtldng shoqid not be arrested for want of the support of the maother country; and that it in the cours of midng the lne the means of the company should become deficient, and should not enable them to psy a resonable amount of interest upon the required capital, the Government or the House would agree, provided the amount should not exceed a certain sum, and the company contracted to carry on the undertaking to the Persian Gulf to provide a small sum to complete it, which Sir SUs Sir. (or, as he afterwards stated, Sir Joux N zm? ili) estimated could not exceed 100,0001. Mr. OnAwronD, in seconding the motion, dwelt upon the importance of establilshing a tel~eerj comm2unication with India, and upon the dutjrrof the Government to give encouragement to suce an object in the same manner as the EAst India-(ompony encouraged railways in India. He made remarks upon the comparative value of different lined of communication. Mr. GLADsToin observed with reference to both proposals, that the House should receive with great jealousy suggestions by membera of Parliament of the great advantage of Government aid to undertakings wbich however beneficial in a philthropical or political point of view, were substantially and essentially commercial, and ought to be left to itand or fall tnder the influence of those motives .which should govern the adoption or promotion of commerdal schemes. He pointed out objections to Mr. EsTcoues' propoal for political reasons, aud expressed his hope that -the - beunt- -woula not entertain it. Adverting to the rules 'vhich, in his opinion, should guide the policy of this country in its foreign relations, he inquired whether it was the Intention of the Government to produce at an early period p!pers WIth xegad to the Danubian PrincipflitiesL .e read from a published ollection of documents an account ofthe mode in which theMoldavianelectionshad been conducted, which, if true, he observed, indicated a moat scndalous and shameful course of proceeding;andhe urged that somethiag should be dons to obviate the in3urious impreeaion~ which such statements must make if they remained uncontradictd Sir F. K=y asked whether the King of OuDB is still in custody or under restraint; ana the chap or the nature of the charge against the Knm upon which he has been deprived of his liberty, observing that bis family in this country entertained a firm belef that he ws utterly incapable of doing any act inconsistent with attachment to the British CBowN and people. Mr. V. Sux, in reply to Sir F. KELy, stated that the King of OuD; was still in arrest at the date of the last letters. The charge w coonplicity in the revolt. An investigation would taka place, and if it ahould be found that ho had nothing to do with the revolt he would, of course, be liberated. He read a letter from the Gov oroGhRnAL to the KiXo stating the reasons of his arrest. After some remarks by Mr. G Bians upon the subject of the Euphrates Railway and the Suiez Canal, Lord PAIxMEs.ro said no doubt the Euphates Railway woo;d facilitate commercial and political communications between this ountry and ldia, and would have the advantage of being an altenative to the line by Alexndria, to Cairo, thence to Suez and down the Red Sea. He was not sure, however.that the line wouldbeonewhich,ifaccomplished, the Government would prefer because if aline were completed from Constantinople through Asia Minor to the Persian Gulf it would be preferabl. But all these were projects of which the British Government should be only a sptator. Heagreed withMfr. Gxastothepolthepoitnalembraminents In which they might involve us anduponthatgtound Ran rIsTfs Government would be indip6eed to mix themselves up even Indirectly with Such pro jecta, which would be at variAnce with the policy they had pursued in reference to sisrpe cta elsewrhere. Therefore, with regard to the Euphrates Valley RaUway, however glad they woulcl be to we it accomplished, he could not hold outfhe slightest encouragement to the parties by the Government' recommending Parlisaent to advanoe them any money. The electrio telqgrph stood upon somewhat different grounds, being AlSgous to postal communications which the Government had encouraged. If a telegrapbic line were estbished either down the Euphrates Valley or by the Red Se to India, the Government, he thought, would act wisely in paying for the use oi it. That waas asnatter openr for consideration. As to the proceedings wrhich had been going on in regard to the P incipalities he cowld not think, he ad, that the pubcations referred to could found a demand upon the Government for copies of diplomatic correspondence. Lord eArmIsow explained the sipulations in the Tre%ty of ParisooncerningthePrincipalitiesandtheproo6dbip taken in fulfilment of thoe atipulations, and stated that therewas now no difference of opinion amo%g tfie sx Powers as to annulling the electionx and ieevxing the lists, so that the fiman of the Porte might be strictly and properly applied.

Indian names have become household words in this country, and a very large proportion of our readers will rapidly scan the extracts from the Bombay nmes in our columns to-day, not for any general conclusion, but to learn the fate of relatives and friends caught in the storm and for a tizae hidden in its terrible darkness. To such readers no political comments can mitigate the distress or lull the anxiety arising rruir, ioir ow- personal concern in this lamentable story. But it is our duty to go at once to that which concerns us all, as affecting the position and honour of this country and the real interest of India,-the prospects of this desperate struggle. There never was a narrative with so many heartrending episodes, yet itself so clear and encouraging upon the main point in which all ot us are concerned. Our Indian authority, gently and benevolently, if not always wisely exercised, may be this day new grounded and newr consecrated by the blood of many innocent martyrs, but we already see it rising unharmed from the conflict, and acquiring new elements of strength and efficiency. The darkness is clearing away, and we see who the insurgents are; we see the allance of Mahomedan pretenders and Hindoo fanatics; we see how little co-operation they are capable of; we see them uniformly giving way before European courage and resolution, not only in the form of British regiments, but before chance bodies of convalescents, deserted officers, and even sometimes a solitary European in command of Irregulars. As bearing on the main question, the news, with hardly an exception, is most encouraging. Up to the 27th of June General BAMXairD had resisted with great slaughter a succession of sorties from Delhi, an attempt to establish an outpost in the suburbs, and an attack on his rear. On the splendid achievements of General VA. CORnA_NDT we have already observed. But, in a word, it may be said that wherever the British have made a stand, with ever so small a body capable of fighting at all, they have maintained the superiority of their race and their cause. Looking to the affair as a mere campaign, everything is going on well, and the complete reassertion of our authority has become a mere question of time. The time will certainly arrive when a tremendous inquisition will be held on the unparalleled atrocities which darken the pages before us. England must and wMl spare no labour, no cost, no iiilitary force, no judicial vigour that may be required, to hunt down the perpetrators, and award them the penalty of their crimes. In this instance we have to make examples that shall never die or decay in Indian memory. But for the present we mnst suppress our indignation, and stop to reason on these narratives. The comments that we make we feel cannot be disputed by the most captious envier of our Indian greatness. In many oeses the natiye soldiers, even when conspirators, and only wvaiting the opportunity, have acknowledged the kindness of their British officers, and protected them from violence, even at some risk to themselves. Our personal relations thus come out clear. We have only been too confiding ; -we have left even too much to the native officers and given them too substantial an independence. They feel this. Hence we read in one iustance of their giving the British officers and other residents several hours' law, offering them the means of escape, allowing them to carry off their private property, and even giving them money or mounting guard at their houses to protect them from chance 'violence. Such particulars are important to the defence of our Indian rule, for that rule has been a military one, and we only hold tho country ia the Romans once held Britain. Whence, then, these hideous atrocities; boast-loads of fugitives shot down, dragged ashore, and butchered in heaps ? Whence the proportion of victims at most of the stations ? The anawer has its consolation. Sometimes a few aggrieved Sepoys, agaiint the feeling and resolution of the regiment, have taken the opportunity of the confusion to auasainate the objects of their personal dislike. Everywhere, ae a natural and inevitable con sequence, the prison doors have been thrown open and thousands of a class which is found everywhere, and nowhere in greater numbers and depravity than in India, have broken loose, to follow their brutal passions and wage a natural war with the maintainers of order. Sometimes a pretender on the Mahomedan law of adoption has carried out his sanguinary code on every man, woman, and child of the infidel race that came within. his reach. Sometimes a wandering mass of mutineers have taken a vanton vengeance on a crowd of British fugitives happening to come in its way. These are all incidents of social chaos. Generally the influence of personal relations has had a couniteracting tendency. No doubt, the Hindoos have only those feelings for us altogether that the subjugated usually have towards their rulers; and no doubt the Mahomedans have only those still more bitter feelings that the supplanted usually have towards their supplanters. The religions and races are against us. This we cannot help. But we submit that these narratives, heartrending as they are, throw a favourable light on our personal relations with the people. But 'we will put a question or two suggested by these details. Can anybody deny that India requires a ruler to win the affections of some; to suppress the ferocity of others; to control religious murderers and religious robbers; to arbitrate between a creed of exclusion and a creed of extermination; to harmonize into one political whole races of hereditary soldiers, hereditary priests, hereditary manElayers, hereditary plunderers, and other races as distine-t in their character as they were in the days of ArAwmm ? Is it not for the interest of civilization and humanity that we 'who have this charge, and can show preeminent claims to it, should grasp it and maintain it 'with the whole strength of the empire ? Who else is there, that has his foot on Indian soil, who oan keep down this volcanic mass of criminal tendencies? iTho else can ever guard the prisons that have just vomited out their thousands, to the terror of the community ? Who else can keep the highways open, and prevent the necessity of resorting to byways t Even at this crisis we feel sure that if the whole Preddency of Bengal could be polled the return would be in our favour. Terrible as the blow has been to us,-to those who read of massacre after massacre of their countrymen, and have too much reason for fearing that their friends are among the victims, we have no doubt the visitation has faUllen quite as severely on the civil population. They look to us to re-establish our name and authority by the most effectual means. It is not, then, only because blood cries from the earth for vengeance, or because a thousand British families are plunged into grief or disiracted with anxiety, but for the more substantial and paramount reason that we are the Providential governors of India, that we must now inflict a terrible retribution and purge the land of its crimes. We have done much, if not our utmost, to humanize the people, to teach them justice, and to give them liberty; so may we with a safe conscience, and no fear of evil tongues, take exemplary vengeance on the authors and abettors of this unmerited insurrection.
The soial questions involved in the Divorce Bill are of great importance, and the incideutal results of the voluminous debae on the subject are in themselves not insignificant; but the country, while it is deeply interested in the dignity of the House of Commons, cannot regard with absolute incdifference the ouicidal vagaries of its most eloquent member. The wanton sacrifice of a great reputation is a public loss, as well ag a melancholy spectacle. Great ability is not common, but practical wisdom is a still rarer and more precious quelby. Mr. Ox.&DoTox1 Iia ur law ouue big utmost to prove that mental subtlety, far fino indicating the presence of good sense and of temper, may become a positively mischievous faculty. On Thursday last the House was engaged for ten hours in discussions on a single clause in the Divorce Bill, and in that time, including questions, explanations, and interlocutory suggestions, br. GLADrTOXN made nine and twenty speeches, some of them of considerable length. Sometimes he was argumentative, frequently ingeniots and critical, often personal, and not less often indignant at the alleged personality of others. Finally, he closed the debate with a vehement attack upon Lord PALMERSTON, on the ground of certain supposed taunts, which of course were declared to be incapable of disturbing his temper. It is probable that some of his arguments may have been well founded, and possible that it may have been judicious to urge them; but no purpose, except that of defeating the Bill by waste of time, could account for twenty-nine distinct appealsto the attention of the Committee. In one of his earlier bursts of eloquence Mr. GLADSTONE complained that the AToRNEy-GENEuRA had fixed his eyes upon him during a denunciation of the proceedings adopted by the opponents of the Bill ; but the eyes and ears of every member present must for a great part of the day and night have been turned in the same direction. Even those who advocated the same opinions must have come away impresed with the conviction that the champion of their cause was too intemperate for a leader, and not steady enough to be trusted as a statesman. It may, perhaps, have been open to those who maintained, in the first instance, the indissoluble character of marriage to propose amendments for the purpose of rendering the provisions of the Bill more generally available; but Mr. GLnsrmToN hag shown in many ways that it is his object rather to involve the promoters in contradictions than to assist them in perfecting the measure. As often as a new possibility of a legal quibble was suggested by himself or by others he reminded the Committee that a new proof had been given of the inability of Parliament to deal fitly with the subject. It is true that no deliberative assembly can legislte with effect unless some restraint is imposed by the good taste of its members on their own freedom of unlimited discussion; but if 1-arliameent is not capable of regulating the conditions of divorce no other authority can take its place. As the AnToRN-Y GERAL stated, with perfect truth, the framers of the Bill made it their business to amend the procedure in cases of divorce, without interferenco with the principles which have from time to time been established by the House of Lords. The introduction into the measure of one or two additional facilities for divorce on the application of the wife naturally suggested to Lord JoHN MN;mRs the expediency of proposing further changes in the same direction; but nothing could be idler than the triumphant asertion that the exception destroyed the whole purpose and principle of the BilL The difficulty which arose in wording Lord JoHxI Maii cas's amendment showed that the Government had not hesitated without reason to open the general question of divorce. Habitual adultery in the conjugal domicile is even a geater offence than desertion, but few instances can oceur in which a mistress is openly forced upon the society of the wife. The proposal to introduce into the clauxe the term "1 concubine," which is equally foreign to English law and to English idiom, wras higbly characteristic of Mr. GLADSTONE, or of hi presnt state of mind. As the strength of a chain is limited by its weakest link, the utility of a discussion is generally regulated by the judgment and temper of the interlocutor who exhibits the smallet degree of self-restraint. The House in general participates in the fashion of introducing useless distinctions, and no member wishes to be inferior to his neighbour in legal or verbal ingenuity. Thus Mr. GLADSTONE was to some eXtent responsible for the utterly purposeless discussion which took place on the various possible aggravations of bigamy. Sir W. HEATHcorz suggested the possibility of bigamy without cohabitation, in cases where the gailty husband was apprehended on his return from church. On this hint half-adozen members eagerly joined in the inquiry whether the crime was complete at the timo of the ceremony, or whether it was necessary to stipulate that the proceeding should have been followed by its natural consequence. As the Committee warmed in the discussion it was discovered that adultery might come before the act of bigamy, as well as after it; and some scruples were entertained as to the case in which the adultery was committed with one partner in crine, and the bigamy with another. In a calmer state of mind the disputants would probably bave remembered that the case of bigamy without cohabitation was so utterly exceptional as to require no special provision. The EIouse of Lords, in making desertion an accessory cause for divorce on the application of the wife, were perfectly consistent in specifying that species of desertion which is of aU others most definite and most capable of proof. The aceident by which a disjunctive particle altered the grammatical meaning of the clause might have been remedied without the machinery of an hour's debate. Adultery with bigamy is as intelligible a definition as adultery with desertion. On this question, as on all others, M. GLADSTONiE outbid all competitors in perverse ingenuity; but for once his legal sagacity led him into a demonstrable blunder. By the Bill, he said, adultery was made punishable with fine, and therefore, in a certain sense, constituted a misdemeanour; but by the existing criminal law bigamy was already a felonious act. It followed therefore that two separate offences might become the subject of the same proceeding; that the greater might be merged in the less or the less absorbed in the greater; or that some other inconveniences might arise which, whether great or small in themselves, were at least sufficient grounds for objecting to the clause. The technical objection was fortunately met by the ATToin,y-GmsNERm&s technical answer that the fine imposed by the Bill was confned to the case of a petition by the husband, whereas the question of bigamy could only arise on the applicstion of the wife, The reply that there was gross injustice in the inequality thus introduced by the Bill was not less hasty and erroneous than the original suggestion. The penalty is not imposed on either of the parties to the divorce, but on the seducer of the wife. Mr. GLr_nsToxL himself would hardly desire that a similar consequence should follow on the immorality of the husband's temptress or victim. The purpose of the objection is, however, explained by the declaration that the bigamy clause afrorded an additional illustration of the total unfitness of Parliament to deal with the subject of divorce. The ArroRnxY-GExLRA looked at Mr. GLADSTONE when he spoke of obstructive tactics. Lord PALMERSTON rmore openly appealed to public opinion to condemn the mode in which the opposition had been conducted, and, though he has since made a Parliamentary apology, his cenaure was in the main correct. if it is a mere form to pretend that it is a duty to oppose " one of the " worst and most carelessly drawnBills on a subject "of the greatest importance that have eveV been "submitted to the House," no manis bound to delay the passage of a clause which he approvea by .far-fotched augggSuVL of pv3aM" to which it might be subjected. Every bo=tty justice of the peace showo that he understauds the meaning of " desertion," by committing the culprit who has left his family to the care of the parish; butwthe House of Commons is asked to pause upon the phrase, because sailors in the commercial navy might be vexatiously eharged with desertion of their wives when they were absent in pursuance of their lawful occupation. The solicitulde for the protection of adulterous mariners against an impossible, risk contrasts admirably with the repeated protS against depriving injured wives of their remedy by divorce. MIr. GLAnSTONE retrieved by his prudent silence in the earlier part of the Session the reputation which he had endangered by his violen-ce during the winter and the spring. It now appears that his eloquence had been only frozen up for a tine, like the music in Baron MuxwnuusEN's post-horn In the warmth of a summer debate the imprisoned tunes burst from their temporary durance, and astonish the hearers by the discharge of their accumulated dissonance.
Swansea stil continues convulsed with an irreconclable dispute about a burialground. Peace has fled, according to the Bishop of ST. D6&vin's account, " private friendships are imperilled," old acquaintances refuse to shake hancds or to recognize one another in the streets, business is interrupted, and famnilylife is disturbed, all on the great question of burial fees. All the world now knows that there is a new Cemetery at Swansea. This new Cemetery iS about two miles from the town. There was the greatest difficulty-for every step in this important undertaking has been beset with difficulties-in procuring a site at all, and when one was obtained it was not only this distance off, but -for a malignant fate still envied Swansea its Cemetery-even this road " lay across bridges " which, at certain states of the tide, would be " open for the navigation of vessels." But, the difficulties of nature surmounted, other difficulties arose. The Vicar of Swansea claimed compensation for the expense to which the distance from the new Cemetery would put him. TheBiihop.of. ST. DAVrD's supported the Vicar's claim. The Burial Board refused to enterin it, on the ground that it was not empowered by law to do so. A. counsels opinion was taken, which was to the effect that the Cemetery fees could be raised to a compensating height. A committeo of the Town Council recommended a proper rise, to the amount of an additional IOOZ. a-year. The Vicar and the Bishop agreed; but the Town Council itself stil deferred the fiDaI ratification. The Bishop waits for this before he consecrates the Cemetery, which still remains unconsecrated. The matter is taken up in the House of Commons. The Bishop replies in these columns, and also on Thursday evening in the House of Lords. Now, there can be very little doubt, as a matter of equity, how such a case as this ought to be decided. It is rather hard upon the Vicar of Swansea to make him go two miles to a Cemetery and back again every time heperforms a funeral, with. out some compensation. You have no right to count on every Vicar of Swansea being a hale, strong man, with good wind, to whom a walk two miles in and two miles out nearly every day in the week wvill be a healthy and agreeable recreation. The air of Swansea is certainly fine and is recommended to invalids, but to take the finest airing " upon compulsion" is not pleasant. Beddee, a walker likes some little choice of his road. The Vicar, then, will want a conveyance to take him backwards and forwards. But, if you make him pay for this out of his own pocket, it is rather a serious expense to entail upon him. The income of the Vicar of Swansea being 981. a-year will be very nearly swallowed up in the cost of conveyance. We do not take into account the consumption of time, which it something, especially as we are informed that the bridges will be at certain states of the tide open to the navigation of vessels, and so interpose considerable delays. It appears to be a plain case that some compensation in equity is due to the Vicar of Swausea for the extra expense which is thrown upon him. But it so happens that the statute does not recognize or expressly provide for such a case as this. Eow are you to interpret the law, then I Are you to say that the statute does not expressly provide for such a case, and therefore does not enforce the consideration of it at all; or are you to say that the statute contemplates general equity and justice in the mode of executing it, and therefore enforces the consideration of it-4. e., gives the Bishop the right to require the satisfaction of such a claim as a condition of consecration ? Lord WmLSEYDAiE interprets the statute in the former way, and says that, the ground being ready for consecration, the Bishop has no right to insist on any other condition. Nor does the counsel's opinion on which the Bishop has acted conflict with this interpretation, because it only says that it was allowable in law to raake compensation, tiot that it was necessary to do so. Nor does the Bishop himself claim any other interpretation. He gives up the legality of the claim as a compulsory one, and says that " it itever came to the point " whether, if the Burial Board rejected his proc posal with reference to compensation, he would 4 refuse to consecrate the ground." That is, we understand him to say, that he has been all along inisting on this claim not as a compulsory one, but only as an equitable and just one, that he has thought it right to stand up for just treatment to one of his own clergy, but that, if this is not conceed, he has been all along ready, and is now ready, to consecrate the ground without compensation to the Vicar. Now, then, that the Town Council of Swansea have asserted their right legally to make their Vicar walk two miles to the Cemetery and back again every day of the week-now that this is ascertained to be good, solid, and irrefutable law, and maintainable before judge and jury in all the Courts of Westminster-now that it is patent that they have the power to make their Vicar do a great deal of extra work, and not pay him a farthing for it-they will, perhaps, be satisfied with the assertion of thoir right, and be magnanimous enough not to act upon it. At least, we strongly advise them to take this course, if they wish to stand well with the world at large. It is all fair, of course, not to do a thing " upon " compulsion," especially if a Bishop wants to make you do anything. That is quite understood. It is only proper and commendable spirit. Never mind what it is that you are forced to do, don't do it if you are forced. It is mean, poor-spirited, and cowardly. But it is a very different thing now that there is no compulsion, and that you can do what you like. If the people of Swansea now make a very underpaid Vicar walk backwards and forwards every day to their Cemetery, or spend all his salary in cabs, it will simply be a very beggarly proceeding. N"o other term can be used, becamuse the justice of the claim is undeniable. They will probably, however, not incur this reflection, but will give the poor man an allowance. They will show how generous they can be when left to themselves, and when no rod is held over them. This is, at least, the best and simplest settlement that we can suggest of this important contest. Even Cemetery rows should not be immortal, and perhaps this has now lasted as long as is respectable. They have the Bishop now at their mercy, and can make hit consecrate, any how. He bows to'his fate, and gives up the point of law. Let them exercise their power with gentleness, and not drag him in triumph after their chariot wheels to the funereal ground. Let this great cemeterial ovation be spared It is a great thing to beat a Bishop, and to beat him on a point of law; for, however the Bishop of ST. DAvI's may explain his past resistance, and whatever good motives he may have had for it, it is clear that he has had the idea that he could enforce the claim of compensation, and that this point lay within his discretion as Bishop. But he now admits that it does not. Let the Town Council of Swansea be satisfied with their triumph over the ecclesiastical potentate, and not rotaliate upon the poor parson.

THE PUNJXAB AND OUDE. TO THIE EDITOPR OF THE TIMES. ir,-I hope all true-hearted Englishmen have been refreshed by the news from the Punjab. Our officers there first meet and incontinently appoint General Reed to the chief command in the provincej and anrrage a moveable column, " subject to the i approbation of his Excellency the Commander-inChief." A reginuent mutinies, Major NTicolson pursues, "cuts them up," and reports that so many have escaped to the Swats, where, of course, first of all, all must become Musgulmans; the next thing being that we shall offer so much a-head for them, And receive them back from these Swats safe and sound. Then deserters are caught. Some are hung. Biigadier Chamberlain, more tender, blows others from guns, they being Brahmins and worthy of the idonour. So it goes on. Our laut announcemen'a is in the usual quiet way:-" The mutineers of the 55th had beeu sentenced, consisting of one subahdar, six havildars, 11 naiks, and 22 privates, and were bloWn away from guns on the 10th." And no doubt it answers. The Punjab is quiet,-nay, spares men for Delhi. Says Brigadier Chamberlain, after blowing two men of the 35th from ganc, "Y You, Subahdar Gyadem Patuck, shall be rewarded. You, Private Ramphal Sook,-you heard the mutineers use seditious language, and on the Court-martial you would not give evidence; you are false to your salt, and you shaUl be vunished." And thus the " Administration" flourishes. Regiments are disarmed, 40 Sepoys are ordered for execution at Peshawur, and the 64th Native Infantry is ordered in, " by forced marches, to witness the execution." Then says Sir John Lawrence,-" Let the Sepoys take care; they are in a good service. If they desert they shall not come back again; the Sikhs are eager to take their places." And the upshot of the whole is this - The Punjab is kept intact; Dost Mahomed on the frontier is defied; there is not a rising n any single station, except Murdan, and that is crushed at once. And why? Let me put In my word of explanation. I hear Lord Dalhousie's health is failing. I fear his services may henceforth be lost to his country, but, living or dying, he shall have justice. It was he who when the Punjab was annexed disarmed the people, pacified them, gave them first-rate rulers, and established British authority on the bais of an adequate European force and a just, vigoroust and beneficent public administration. Turn to Oude. To garrison Lucknow Lord Canning has been compeUed to keep Cawnpore without a mingle European. In all Oude itself he has had only one European corps, and that at Lucknow. A storm bursts. The forts are al untouched in native hands-the Oude Irregulars are all troops of the deposed King-the people have arms In their hands -our sole security is a few Sepoy regiments, themselves recruited in Oude and under the influence of the popular traditions, sympathies, and prejudies I The storm rises, and Sir Henry Lawrence most nobly holds Lucknow; but Cawnpore and all its neighbourhood on the one side and all the country of Oude on the other rise in rebellion; and, alas ! what is the issue? I confess I know not. I hear some of the detailsmassacres in various forms, atrocities beyond belief, the country in disorder, the whole army crowding to surround our faithful remnant at Lucknow. But I cannot conceive alZ the misery, aU the ruin which that fertile land has witnessed. And wvhat is the causeof aU ? Because the wise policy of Lord Dalhousie was not imitated, qbut Oude was left unprotected and unawed by an European force, and the disaffected people, unreconciled to the annex. tion, were left with their arms and their forts untouched. And then glance beyond Oude to Cawnpore and all its neighbourhood, denuded of European forces to give to Lucknow its trifling garrison: what are the tales of horror, of treachery and of suffering which reach us from all that surrounding district I As yet we know only. a part of the reality; but when all is told it will be hard to restrain the English soldier from exacting due retribution I I will not enter into the shocking details; but if you can imagine in one place a party of Europeans caught, placed in custody, and then brought out one by one and massacred in cold blood; If you can conceive in another a party of wounded men left in misery and nakedness, without food, to meek mercy in declaring themselves Mahomedans; if you can imagine five boatloads with 130 fugitives hurrying dowrn the Ganges, hiding under sandbanks, but detected at last, fired upon vwith cannon, and then brought on shore, and every mmn, woman, and child of them murdered, you will have some idea of a part of the horrors with which of late we here have become familiar I There are stories of Delhi which I hope are not true; but these are stories of Oude and the neighbourhood of Cawnpore which, apparently are too true; and on whom does the responsibility for the blood of our slaughtered countrymen justly rest? Allow me to say that in keeping British troops at home for her own objects England has very little to congratuate herself. Perhaps this is not fashionable language. But then I cannot find it easy to talk fashionably. I know what it is to feel indignation at dignified incapacity, and still more at political trickery; and, feeling it, I do not see why I should not express it. Nay, more, I call on you to echo it. We are entitled to the sympathy of the Times. This great empire has been perilled, a large part of it has been desolated and ravaged, our countrymen have been hunted and barbarously murdered, our troops have been overmuarched In a trying season, and have died by hundreds by dbeae; we have witnesseda social revolution, and nobody is to blame I However, Sir, 1 believe we are very much in your hands. We greatly need your powerful advocacy, and we shall suffer sorely if itis denied us. I appea to you again to help us with all your influence gad power. Hasten out our troops ; demand oompetent oommanders; sweep away red tape andmonopoly ancd the seniority system; if India has first-rate men)like Jacob, Lawrence, Edwardes, and Chamberlain, lot her have the use of them, as she had the use of Clive; inquire why there is such a contrast between the measures in the Punjab and the measures in Bengal; ask how Lord Auokland with a tree press carried on the Affghan war while ill threatened by Runjeet Singh's army and the unconquered forces at Gwalior, and why Lord Canning finds a gagged press an esential element of his policy; let English sympathy be awakened by complete information and free dinesudon in your untrammelled columns at home; and then we may hope to see India's tranquillity estblished and the British name onoe more regaining its influence in this country.

Twvo of the carrages were completely smahed, and the people inside ofthem were strugglng nd groaning fearfully. The tops of these nehicles were ipped off an soon as possible, and the p;aengers were drawn out one after another and ald or seated on th upright earri4aes.

INDIA. EA. portion of the following appeared in our second edition of yesterday :.j We have received, in aticipation of the Overland Mail, one single paper from Bombay to the 14th of July, and filea from Calcutta to the 4th of July. Our letters from Bombay have not yet arrived. (From the Bombay Tinzes of the 14th of July.) In the last fortnight vwe have probably passed "the flood" of the insurrection, and may now hope that our future advices will be chiefly occupied with a Tecital of the subsidence of this great rebellion,and the restoration of order in the disturbed provinces. The truth is that thera are no more regiments to mutiny, unless they are to be those of Bombay and Madras, concerning the fidelity of which there is not the slightest ground of suspicion. Delhi had not fallen up to the 27th June, the date of our latest advices, vid Lahore. There has been a good deal of fighting outside the walls, the rebels being defeated on every occasion with great slaughter, and it is matter of much congratulation that the apparent hopelessness of their camuse a efiectually checked the disposition of the mutineers at other stations to proceed to their assistance. The only attempt which has been made to Teinforce them seems to have been on the part of the Nusseerabad mutineers, who were out up dreadfully on the occasion by General Barnard's xorce. -Whether any of them got inside the walls or not we cannot say. Duringthe fortnight just elapsed we have received intelligence of the mutiny of the troops at Moradabad, Fyzabad, Seetapore, Saugor, Nowgong, Barda, Futteighur, M-how, and Indore, and we proceed - briefly to relate the particulars of each so far as they are known to us. It is now evident that an arrangement existed betwveen the troops at Bareilly, Shahjehanpore, Lucknow, and Moradabad to effect a simultaneous rising. A glance at the map will show the proximity of these stations to each other, and the outbreak occuTred at each on the morning of the same day. The mutiny at Bareilly, which we reported ia a few words in our last issue, seems to have been attenaed with circumstances of peculiar atrocity and treachery. Only the day before their outbreak the Sepoys appealed to their officers to recall their wives and families from the hils, where they had been sent for safety, and even to the last moment these miscreants swore to protect their officers to the death. The regiments rose en mwsse on Sunday morning, the Ist of Juue, a shotted gun being fired as the signal about 11 o'clock. The men at once rushed upon the officers' lines, and opened a fusillade upon the bungalows. Such officers as wer able i-mediately got on their horses, and made for the rendezvous previously agreed upon among them-the cavalry parade-ground. An inefectual effort was made to bring back the troops to their allegiance, but the scoundrels opened upon them with grapeshot, and they had to ride for their lives. The country having risen in all directions, it was with extreme difficulty, and only by a ride of '70 miles, that the little band at last found safety at Nynee Tal, in the hills, where they had previously sent their families. Here the refugees are congregated in numbers which will probably awe any attempt to attack them, and, as the place is of very difficult approach, we may hoDe they are in safety. At Moradabad the desire of plunder seems to have prevailed over the murderous pro. pensities of these miscreants, and they gave their officers two honrs' grace to make their escape, in which they fortunately succeeded, the whole of the officers (29th Regiment) and the residents, with their families, escaping to Nynee Tal the day after the arrival of the Bareilly refugees. We stated in our last advices that great fear was enterctained that the whole of the station of Shabjehanpore had been massacred. We are happy, however, to learn that a good many have esaeped, but we are unablo as yet to give the particulars. The rising at Fyzabad occurred on the night of Sunday, the 8th ult., the 6th Regiment of Oude Irregular Infantry giving tlhe signal, which was immediately anaswvered by the 22d Regiment of Native Tnfantry. They at once took possession of the battery, and would not allow the officers to approach, but do not seem to have offered them any further violence. Fyzabad is in the very heart of Oude, an(d is situate upon a branch of the Ganges. Thle officers determined to endeavour to escape by boat, and were allowed quietly to emabark. What followved is thus related by one of the party,- " I remember the officers in the two boats; I accompanied Lieutenant Bright, 22d Native Infantry; Lieutenant Parsons, Gth Oade Irregulars, Lieutenant Cautley, 22d Native Infantry. Sergeant Basher, Sergeant-Major, Qnartorwaster. Sergeant, 22d Native Infantry, and myself were in one boat; Colonel Goldney, Lieutenant Currie, Artillery, Lieutenaat Ritchie, 2Td Native Infantry, Sergeant Elwards, and Sergeant-hiajor Matthews in the second boat; three other boats folowed behind. We waited two hours for them, but as they did not come we pushed off. As we were getting into the boat we saw the Sepoys of the 22d rushing towvards the Treasury; there were about 2 lakbs and 40,00! rupees in Captain Drummond's house, where the treasure had been placed. On reaching a place caUed Begumgung-, about 10 miles below Fyzabad, we met some mutineers encamped; at half -past I these men fired upon us; there were 800 or 300 of them; about 100 men fired on us when we were 600 yards off. Colonel Goldney advised our pushing off to the opposite bank of the Gogra; we got on an Island among some ihow fields. The mntineers got into dingies and followed us; we made for the main boat from the island; there were about 40 or 50 yards of waterbetween. Major Mills was drowned. The Sergeant-Major, Lieutenant Bright, and I were takei prisoners, and taken to the camp of the matineers, who were men of the 17th and 37th Native Infantry and the 17th Irregular Cavalry. We were taken before the Soubabdar commanding the rebels. I don't know his name; he was a Hindoo, and belonged to the 17th Native Infantry. He was an old man, slightly made, abo5ut feet S inches high, with gray hair, no hair on his face, and dark complexion. Ile asked us who we were; we replied. Re then appealed to the Adussulmaus on the Koran, and to the Hindoos on the cow, not to injure us, and told us to go away. Two men of the 1l'th then stepped out and shot the Sergeant-Major and Lieutenant Bright. I was rescued by an artilleryman, and was bid ina 'er-i at Beguagunge, and sent off in disguise. While we were talking to the Sonbahdar some 15 or 16 of the Irregular Cavalry and 10 or 12 Sepoys went after the remainder of our party. We heard firing acros the river; the party returned, and reported they had aed Colonel Goldney and six other officers, and that three had escaped, O. arriving at Tanda, on the 10th instaut, I heard peoplo in the serai saying that six or seven oficers had been Rlie, anc -A.aweo he eehlee ysm enna kfflea, and tvvo or three weore sheltered by sorme vridr tbe Gormckpore district. After this I came Vid Mattoopore, Shabgunge, and Juanpore. Captain Reed, Deputy-Com. nissary; Captain A. P. Orr, Asistant-CommLsary Mr. B. 0. Bradford, ditto; and Captain Thurnburn, reached Rajah Mann Singh's house, and he promised shelter and protection. Whe4 I was at Mattoopore I heard that the above oficers were going down in boats, with their fainile, escoTtea by somne of the Rajah's guard. At Tanda I hcasd that a zir. Fitzgerald, clerk in the Deputy-0 ommissioner's office, and Overseer Sergeant Hurst, who were escorting the falnilies Of some seTgs.nts to Allahabad, rid Sultanpore, were Idlled, and the wiom6n and children aso murdered. I do not know what has hcome of the officers who were in the bosts behind us when we left Fyzabad2' We have reason to believe, hl>owever, that a con0 siderable namber of the officers have efiected their escape from this tatloz andi whatever may have taien place adte- la'mng- it,-the conduct of the Sepqy* at -the, tim-eems to luve bemeh o ahocrlzed _ y-thothengeet modertio,L We eano feii5}t 1tad~~~~p ofqogajr o, T'a . 004. c:o q(' v6 muffia oi. ihi'"'"'' R-esnt bsa any ro o; . guarded their o toffloe gad- -their VSnatow .ter:tse tlsi ' d frl o -the sisasinesf ane al p'uJlio prQpet, &4t7x to prevent the towpeople and servants from lootlng, and held a concil of war, in which the cavalry (Fisher'g Irregulars) propoded to kll the officers, but the 22d objeoted, and informed the officers that they would be allowed to leave, and might take with them their private arms and proporty, but no pubUo property, as that all belonged to the King of Oude. Their officers asked for boats: the rebel Commissary-General, a Rissaldar, was ordered to provide them, He did so, bat merely small dingies, so that they could only bring away a bundle each, and then they were presented with 9OOrs., which the rebels hadc taken from the troasure chest to give them. When the officers tried to recall them to their duty, they respeotfully assured them that they vwre now under the orders of their native officers, and that the Soubaidar Major of the 22d Regiment had boen appointed to the commnand of the station, and that eaoh corps had appointed one of its ofiacers to be their chief." We are as yet without particulars oif the mutiny at Saugor, the news of which reached us on the 8th instant from our correspondent at Kamptee, -who was able, however, to inform us that -no atrocities had as yet been committed, all the officers and families, with the European ArtLUlery, having taken refuge ina the fort. Saugor is the chief station in the districts known as the Saugor and Nerbudda territories, and must have a considerable European population. in the shape of writers, conductors, and others, concerning whose safety, after what has transpired at Jhanus, in these same territories, much uneasiness must be felt. It is to be hoped that these men and their familie.s have taken refuge in the fort also. Concerning the mutiny at NowgOng, we simply know the fact that the head-quarters of the 12th Native Infantry and of the 14th Irregular Cavalry stationed there have followed the example of the left wing of each corps, which were stationed at Jhansi, but that the officers are safe. The news of the Jhanai mutiny we communicated by last mail, with an account of the bloody tragedy enacted on that occasion by the massacre of all the Eiropeans in the place. We now learn that, besides Mrs. Skene and family, Mrs. Browne, Miss Browne, and Miss Davidson were killed. Altogether 12 of our country men and women were slaughtered in this Small station. The only persons known to have escaped are two Custom6' officers, who have reached Agra. The only particulars we have of the mutiny at Banda are contained in a letter from Nagode, dated June 19, of which the following is an extract:- "- We have esoaped from Banda to Nagode, and, through God's mercy, have been miraculonsly preserved. On Sun. day, the 14th, the Nawab's troops mutinied, as well as the Native Infantry. The Mahomedaus planted their flag and wanted to kill us, but the Nawab stood by us, and we got into buggies and on horses and got off. The place was in a blaze before we had got a mile: it was a fearful scecN. We's start again to-night for Mdirzapore,and hope to reach it safely, but this district is very much disturbed. We have in our party Mr. and Mfrs. Edmonstone, Mr. and Mr Webster, Messrs. Mayn%, Sherer, Clark, Bews, Cousins, Iatohinson, Oswin, and Glyn. We are staying With Major and Mrs. Ellis, at Nagode. Their kindnes is extremne, and we havo rested two days." Of the whole country of Rohilcund, Futtehghur (Furruckabad) was the last station to rise. The 10th Regiment has unquestionably given in simply to the force of the dangerous example all Tound it. The Sepoys of this corps continued for weeks to guard the treasury and maintain discipline, while every station near them was in open mutiny. They do not appear to have offered any violence whatever to their oflicers, but a most melancholy rumour prevailed in Allahabad on the 23d inst. as to the fate of the unhappy fugitives after they left the place. WVe take it from the Englilshman of the 29th ult.:- "Did the report of the massacre reach you of the Futtehghur fugitives ? It surpassed in atrocity all that has hitherto been perpetrated. 132 Europeans, men, women, and children, in 50 boats left Fottehghur for this place. " They were all the non-mailitary residents of the place. On arrival at Bhitoor the Nana Sahib fired on them with the artillery the Government allowed him to keep; one round shot struck poor Mrs.- , and killed her on the Fpot. The boats were then boarded, and the inumates landed and dragged to the parade-gronaid at awnpore, where they were first fired at and then literally hacked to pieces with tulwars. Report says not one es1aPea." Bhitoor is a little place a few miles to the north of Cawnpore, and we sadly presage a confirmation of this intelligence, in view of the state of matters in that neighbourhood. A bloody reclkoning will surely be exacted of these fiends in human shape. At Mhow the 23d Bengal Native Infantry have mutiniedl; the number of Earopeans slain is at present unknown, but it is said to be four. The officers are holding a fortified square in the place, where the ladies and all the other Europeans have taken refuge. If the 3d Nizam's Cavalry prove stanch, they wilL soon be relieved, as Captain Orr was within 50 miles of Mhow some days ago. We know little of the state oE matters at Indore beyond the fact that the two regiments of the Maharajah Holkar have openly mutinied and proceeded with the Bengal Regiments towards Oojein, on their way, as is aupposed, to Delhi. The Mlaharajah seems to be in no way implicated in this business, but to have actedvwith the same good faith that has characterized the conduct of the Gwalior Prince. We have now again arrived at the close of a long and tragic story. We can, of course, understand well the intense excitement this intelligence wiU produce at home, and we pass on without comment to notice the state of matters before Delhi, and the progress of the siege. The force at General Barnard's disposal has doubtless been inadequate for the reduction of the place, but, as important reinforcements must have joined his camp long before this, we entertain a confident bope that our next advices will announce the fall of the place. Meantime, the force las not been idle. Animated by the courage of despair, the mutineers have made the most desperate sorties, but always with the same result. They have been driven back into the city with terrible loss on every occasion, to find eventually, as we trust, their tomb within its walls. Our columns contain ample details of these several iactions, and to attempt to summaarize them here Lvould swell our epitome to an inconvenient length. General Van Cortlandt, who is marching upon Jhansi and Hissar with the Buttianah Irregular Force, has had two engagements with the rebels in the neighbourhood of Sirsa, defeating them in each instance with severe loss. The last actlon was a very decided one, and the rebels fled in disorder, leaving 200 men dead uponL the field, besides many prisonLers in our hands. The troops of the Bikanir Rajah, 2,700 men of all arms, have joined General Cortlandt's force, though what reliance can be placed on these men remnins to be seen. MajorGeneral Nicholson's moveable column was at Jullundur at the date of our last advices, ei Lahore. The whole Punjab remains quiet, thanks to the energetic conduct of the Commissioner and the men in command. Many of the disarmed native regiments have begged the restitution of their weapons, and to be led against Delhi, but it would be madness, after what has tianspired, to listen to such prayers. The men may be loyal in their present mood, but, in the presence of an example such as that offered now at Delhi, would yield to the daigerous influence to a certainty.

General Woodburn's moveable column, originally ordered to MIhow, stands fast at Aurungabad, and this arrangement is doubtless a judicious one, mI view of the unsettled state of the Nagpore territories and the doubtful temper of the Nizam's troops. We regret to learn that the General has been com. pelled to resign the command through severe sickness. Colonel C. S. Stuart is appointed to succeed him. This force is composed as follows :-Two squadrons of Her Majesty's 14th Light Dragoons, a Battery of European Horse Artillery, 25t4 Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, 24th ditto (one wing), and the Light Infantry Battalion (Persia). General Woodburn's column has already eushaed the rebellion at Aurungabad, where our readers may rermember a regiment of the Nizam's Cavalry mutinied, and the presenee of the force at that atatioa will doubtless overawe effectually any open dieaffection in that quarter for the future. As some uncertainty seems to exist as to the real strength of General Barnard's foree before Delhi, we may as well state that it is composed as follows:- BUROPEANS (About 8,000 Men of all Arms.) Her majesty's 6'h Carabineers. Her Majesty's 9th Lancers. Her Majesty's 8th Regiment of Foot. Har Majesty's Gist Regimenxt of Foot (one wing). Her Majesty's 60th Rifles. Her Majesty's 75th Foot. Hon. East India Company's 1st Bengal Fusileers. Jaon. East India Company's 2d ditto (6 companies). Five Troops of Horse Artillery (abont 600 men):-20 6- poumders, 4 9-pounders, 2 18-pounders, 5 howitzers. Artillery Recruits 120 men. The siege train from the Sntlej. NATIVES (About 5,000 Men of all Arms). One squadron 4th Regiment Light Cavalry. Two Light Field Batteries, each five 9-pounders, one 24. ditto. A detachment of Sappers and Miners The Sirmoor Ride Battalion-700 strong. The Punisb Guides-250 sabres, 500 bayonets. 1,000 men Panjab Infantry, Irregulars. 1,200 sabres Punjab Cavalry, Irregulars, The Rajah of Jheend's Force (strength unknown) There cannot be fewer than 7,000 Europeans now before the place, if indeed they are not already inside. The native portion of this force has proved itself trustworthy; and, considering the powerful artillery now at Genaeral Barnard's command, and the strength of his cavalry arm (3,500 sabres), we shall have room to express the deepest dissatisfac - tion if the blow which is here struck be not final, Bo far as the mutineers of Meerut, Delhi, and Nusseerabad are concerned. The miscreants are fairly caged, and will find their graves in the spot they have polluted by their bloody and atrocious crimes. THE PROGRESS OF THE REVOLT. (From the Friend of India.) The fire must needs burn out when the fuel is exhausted; and the mutinies have almost ceased, because there are few corps left to be operated upon. A close scratiny of th , A-miy List made a few days since by competent person gave a total of sevenregiments which, it wassupposed, migh be relisd npon as being really stanch, but for a policy of insurance on even their loyalty a heavy premium would have to be paid. The most sanguine have grown too cautionu now to guarantee the fidelity of any portion of the nativ army; and men who were abused six weeks since fo - their anticipations of wide-spread evil havo it now all thei ' own way. The community have become stupefied with the succession of disasters, to which there is no set-off save in the isolated instances of bravery and fortitude furnished by Lawrence, Wheler, and Neile, who challenge admiration by the way in which they hold the ground covered by their tents and guns. Day after day and week after week rolls on, and tidings from Delhi grow fewer and fainter. Twevoty. five days have elapsed since General Barnard was to have reached the city with bis whole force. The daily journal1 of Friday last recelved intelligence from Government that the place had been captured and three-fourths of the rebels destroyed,-the news having come, not to the head of the State in Calcutta, bu.t to a " great banker at Indore." For seven days utter ailence has been maintatued by the authorities on the subject, who knowing, of course, how deeply important it is to thousands that the news of the downfall of Delhi should be circulated, feel perhaps that it is of greater moment still to withhold such information as they are supposed to possess. We question the wisdom of the polioy, but time wlll clear up the meaning of it. The last reliable information from General Barnard's camp wa; to the effect that he had made a hole in the city wall, and had sat down before it. Yesterday Government circulated intelligence that Delhi had been taken, and 7,000 of the insurgents slain. They are reported to have fought with desperation, and to have been at last not all exterminated, but driven from the city If this be true, men will scarcely regard it as a victory, for the mutineers will but have been expeUed from one strong. hold to fly to another. Much credit, however, should not be attached to the report, for, though officially commrnicated, it rests upon slight foundation. The story has travelled far and passed through many hands. It originated at Ajmera, received strength and circumstantiality at Bombay, journeyed to Nagpore, and finally was transmitted by telegraph to the Supreme Government at CI'cutta. From Colonel Durand, at Neemuch, intelligence has since been received that Delhi was stormed on the 14tb, and the remainder of the rebels driven into the fort. It will be recolleeted that some time back we spolke of a rumour that two native regiments in the camp of Sir Henry Barnard had mutinied, and were in consequenco cut to pieces. The story of the crime was true enougb, but not so that of the puni-hment. The Commander-in-Chief was afraid of the responsibility of action, and soothed the mutineers into good bumour. We do not blame the public for believing the whole tale. It was hardly possible to sup. pose that a body of Sepoys would have dared to show insubordination in tho presence of several European regiments, but still harder to believe, that, having rebelleo, they should eseipe scot free. The censure passed by Lord Dalhousie on Sir Charles Napier for his disbandment of the 66th Native Infantry would not have been repeated at thi, moroent; besides which, the conqueror of Scinde wa, blamed, not so much for the act as for the needless haste in which it was carried out. The Bombay papers have lengthy details of the sabject, but the ventilation of it only serves to deepen the hoart-sickness resulting from long-deferred hopes of vigorous action. It is siugular that energy and power should be incapable of combination, but certainly recent events would seem to establish the paradox. Colonel Neile, with 137 men of Eer !Majesty's l0th Regiment, and 37 of the gladras Fnsilt rs could establish order at Beuares andpunish threwregiments, while General Barnard with some hundreds of Enropean troops at his beck dared not to cut up the mutinous 5th and 60tb. Every man who owes us a grudge believes that the time has come to exact payment. No idea can be formed as yet of the utter state of disorganization which prevails in the Upper Provinces. Trade is wholly destroyed, the public highvays everywhere overrau by thieves; the clispossele5 Zemindars in nearly all the villages bave emerged into dAy. light, and ousted their snucessors. Scores of petty Rajabs have proclaimed their independence, and make up for defects of title by ceaseless activity in the work of robbery and murder. Of all the villains engaged in those congenial puruits, Nana Saheb would ap. pear to be the most bloodthirsty. This man is the adopted son of the late ex-Peishwa Bajee Ban, and as such laid claim bo the reversion of his enormous pension, but tha Government overruled his pretensions, and he is now reap. ing the harvest of his revenge. He has organized a corps of assassins, and not a day passes in which some poor hunbtd European is not brought in and literally hacked to pieces,. His last act of butchery was of a wholesale character, andlit is alpity that he has not a thousand lives to make expiation for it. An alarm had broken out,-cause-' lessly, as it seem3,-atjFtttyghur, and 132:persons (men, women, and ohilaren), ia 50 boats, left that plaoe for AlIa.- h*bad, but none of them reached their destination.

Sattara has been recently thrown into considerable alarm, but the panic has now subsided, owing to the jadicious con. dact of Mr. Rose. On the 11th of June it was commonly reported that there was to be a rising of all the Xahrattas. There were 500 malcontents in the city, and 800 from the B,'re country were en -route. Lieutenant Kerr was at once ordered off to arrest the insurgents. He had but 5o mer, and with these he accomplished in 20 hours 50 miles. His sudden appearance, though he met with ro armed force, was productive of no slight good. The would-be rebels wera astonished, and when they thought themselves most seaaie were confronted by an armed force. A. Pattahwallah in the service of Government attempted to sedace the 22d Reginent from their allegiance, but fortunately, owing to the fidelity of a Soubahdar, he was seized. Affairs now wear a much better aspect, and it Is not likely, unless any great disaster befalls oar troops elsewhere, that tha attempb to restore the line of the Rajahs wiU succead. The arrival of an 1uropean force from Poonah has given an additional sense of security. At Hydrabad there has been conriderable alrrar, and some real danger. Seditious placards were posted in some partb of the town, and a Sepoy, the 'oearer of a treasonable mee. sage to the townspeople, was captured; but the Arabs proved stanch, and, being placed at the gates of the city, effectually debarred the Sepoys from holding any commumd. cation with the dis%ffected among the inhabitants. The Bhurtpore levies haveprovedas treacheroasasthe Mohidpore Contingent, but, as a set-off, the Malwah Contingent have behaved most nobly. They resisted. all thex ttempts ot the Cavalry to sieze the Treasury at Mehidpore, and with far inferior forces finally beat them off. The spirit of disafrfe-. tionhas been carriedtomostunlkelyplaees; evenat Bauioe there Is a report that a mutinous spirit has exhibited itself In the 16th Regiment of Bombay Native Infaxury. We attach no credenoco to the rumour, snd feel assured that the companions in arms of those troops who acted so gallantly at Nuseerabad would not willingly even induce a suspicion. But the report is significant, and shows how easily among races so fickle as Asiatics empires may be lost and won. I The outbreak of the local troops at Nagpore has bsen quelled, And the ringleaders shot by sentence of court-martiaL At Seetabuldee matters are in a very unatisfactory state, but, luckily for the quiet of the province, Eampteo is garrisoned by Mas troops, or tho whole country wonli have boen in a blaze of insurrection. Saugor, Jubbalpore, Nagode, and Damoh were quiet on the 23d nlt., and CaptainPFinkey had gone up from Jubbulpore to put down the Thakoors in Chuadagree and Jhansi districts. He took with him four companies of Infantry from Saugor, a few Irregular Cavalry, and half a battery of guns. Seetapore has faUen, and it is known thab Major Birch and several oscears of tho 41st ara killed, but no names have bean farnished. Fears are entertained for tbe safety of Messrs. Christian, Thomason, and Thornhill, of the Civil Service, and there is a long list of brave atd distinguished men missing, and rmost probablj murdered, to which w e dare not refer. We have thought at times that the worst fought to be told, but the task is too painful, and we put it off till a later day; the sense of horror is grown dull, and the day of vengeance seems far distant. The bulk of the residents at S'habjehanpore were saved, it is said, by the interference of native servants. The mutineers wanted to fire upon the Europeans in the church, but the Syces protected them, and enabled them to quit the station, the magistrate, Mr. Ricketts, falling, however, a victim to the rebels. At Banda the 1st Nativo Infantry, who wero in possesion of the treasare, were requested by the authorities to allow access to it, but refased. The Bajah's troops were ordered up to disarm them, but the congenial souls fraternized, and, helping themselves to the coin, compelled the }uropeans to fly for their lives. It is said that Mr. Dorin has called for a retutrn of all the treasres looted by the rebels. The sum total wil remind him of the days of Nadir Shah and the sack of Delhia; and if the comparison fails with regard to the wealth of the despoiled, it vill be exwt enough with regard to their helplessess.

Some farther brief details have been received by telagraph of the skirmishes which occurred before Delhi on the 27th. It is stated that our artillery did great execution, while the kitled on our side did not exceed 12. Lieutenant Harris of the 2d Fusileers, was wounded, and Lieutenant Chalmers, of the Guides, slightly. A letter received from Delhi, from the political agent at Bhurtpooe, dated the 22d, states that all was weU at Lucknow and at Allahabad up to the last advices; and at the latter station it is stated that the mutineers were very severely dealt with by the Sikh regiment stationed there. The letter further mentions that a large force of European, was collected at Benares, which will, doubtless, have moved upwards ere this. It is reported that the mutineers of the Gwalior Contingent are endeavouring to coerce the Maharajab, bat their ultimate intentions are not known. I;urther details have been received of the action at Delii on the 23d, on whieh occasion the efforts of the mutineerq were more determined thao on sny previous one. It is said that theirdead, at the close of the day,were counted by haun dreds, their agzregate being estimated at not less than 1.00). The gairdens aInd h,uildinags outside of the city, in which they had sheltered themselves, and given us much annoyance, have been taken possession of by us; and it is said thst since the above date they have, in a marked manner, evinced less boldness in their attacks than heretofore. L, UO'NTGOMERY, Judicial Commissioner. (From the Delhi Gazete Eztra, June 25.) The following letter, dated " Camp before Delhi," will be found highly interesting:- "- Juse 1S (Waterloo Day), 1857. "Rather a brisk affair occurred here yesterday. During the day, but particularly in the afternoon, the enemy were observed outside the Labore gate in large numbers, evidently planning and carrying out some special project. At halfpast 4 o'clock p.m. our troops were turned out to ascertain, if possible, what it might be, and in a very short time they were busily engaged in most laudable musketry practice. Tombs (Major), with his Troop of Horse Artillery, was, as usual, on the ground. The Rifles (Her Majesty's 60th) anLd the Ghoor3sas being the otber principal dramais personcr, After a time it was observed that a large serai, called " Bed Obab," opposite the Ajmere gate, was being occupied by the enemy, and that it had been strengthened from without by the defences which had been constructed during the day. "4It was resolvedthatthe said seraisbouldbe ours; thoagh I must tell you that it was an exceedingly strong positioc, which a few hundred stout-hearted men might hold in face oE thousands. It was attacked accordingly, and taken in glorious style. The enemy stood for a time, but their show of resistance was, on the whole, brief. The gates of the place were smashed; the enemy's ammnnition (two hackery loads) blown up, and the only gnu (a 9-pounder4 which they had timo to bring to the scene of action spiked, taken, and walked off with toul de suilc. Their lose wra probably considerable. I should think at least 100 killed, while, I rejoice to say, we only lost three or four men in all, exclusive of a small number Oi the list of wounded. in the evening, whilst we were sitting at mess in the open air, General Barnardrode up and asked iE Major Tombs was present. On being informed that be was not, the General, without dismounting from his horse, said that he hsi come to the Artllleryn mess publicly to express his opinion of Major Tombs's gallantry in the affair which had just terrninated. He said, considering the strong nature of the enefy's position, the resolute manner in which it w& attacked, the maserly wyay in which our troops were bandled, and the hzppy result of the whole engagement, he ha4 neaer in the course of his mlitary experienoe seen more zemarkable bravery or cooler, hetter judgment dia,played&by an*y officer in'th'e field than by Major Tomis of the Artllery.

Accounts received from Asseerghur, dated the 7th inst., give the follo-ing particulars:-Tbe wing of Scindia's Contingent had been moved down iuto the low country outside the fort of Asseerghur. and the company at Burhampore had been disarrned and made prisoners by Captain Birch, with a small party of Bheels. This places the safety of the fart beyond all doubt. as the Bheels are trustworthy men, Whose fidelity has never been questioned, and they are of a totally different Tace from these rascally mutineers, with wom they cannot possibly have any sympathy whatever.

PORBIGN INTEMMITRAT :.' FRANPR- (rR0OM Oul? OWN CORRVCPO1nWm I PARIS, TnHURDAY, AUG. 13,6 e.x. The anxiety which prevailed on the divergence between the English and French Governments on the question of the Moldavian elections it now happily at an end, no doubt to tbe great disappointment of the Legitimist Union and others ofg that Btamp. The declaration of Lord Palmerton has set the matter at rest; Gallic amour Sn7-e is satisfied; and the courageous vindicators of electoral punity (in Moldavia) are triumphant. T!g Am- sesadors of Russia, France, Prussim. and Sardinia have, I suppose, resnmed relations with the 'orto, and once more hoisted their flags. This pilling down and hoisting of flags, by the way, must be a merely figurative expression. .Anbassadors and plenipotexitiaries do not, I believe, hang out flags. The armorial shields of their Sovereigns are aflired to their gates, but the bunting is only used by consuls. Baroni Hubner, theAustrian Ambassador in Pais, had an interview this day with the BMinister for Foreign Affairs, which lasted some time. It is said that his Excellency communicated the fact Mn the withdrawal of the opposition of his Government to the annulling of the elections, and that generally the esult of the conversation was satisfactory to' both parties. I have little doubt that the French Ambasador at Constantinople and the Corunmissioner of the French Government in the Plincipalitihs a enjoined to keep Atrict charge over the new. elections with A viov to their legality, nd.to"tat every man shall give his vote freely; abovea4that no Man shall suf}er injury on account of his opibions, and that public funetionaries shall act with! complete impartiality, and not interfere in the sdightest degree with the independent electorfof Moldavia. This is as it should be. The French Moniteur of yesterday contai4ed a decree dismissing the Sous-Prefet of the arrondissewent of Grasse (department of the Var). Pirsons who know a good deal about the department *ffirm; that the great f-ault found with this luckless functionary was allowing the Opposition candidate at the late elections(French, not Moldavian) to oktain 3,000 votes. It is true the Government nominee had somnewhere about 20,000, aud waa conseqIenzly returned; but 3,000 for his adversary swas beyond the mark. I mention what is said and believed, but presume it must be a calumny. The Government to dismiss a functionary on such groundsr-the Government who are so careful of the independence of Atoldavian electors I-fl done ! A letter from Carthagena, in Spain, of the 5th inst., informs us that the British Beet under the command of Adinral Lord Lyons, composed of four ships of the line, two corvettes, and two gunbrigs, anchored on the 4th inst. at the entrance of the port of Carthagena, coming from Algiers, and a iled on the 5th for Malaga. The Moniteur publishes an Imperial decree, granting a modal to every French and foreign soldier or seaman who served in the Prench army or-navy from the year 1792 to 1815. The medal is to he of bronze, and will bear on one side the effligy o the Emperor, and on the other the rords, " Campaigns of 1792 to 1815-To his companion!s of glory, his last thoughts, 5th of May, 1821."

Colonel Spottiawoode, two ofricers, and some men proceed overland to select horses, so that the regiment on its arrival may be well mounted. OWr-Malta correspondence comts down to the 10th of August, early on the morning of which day the Jnra, Enrqpeaa and Australian steamer, arrived from Alexandria, whenee she took her departure on the 6th. having had a long passage from the indifferent quality of her fuel. The Eurolpan, from Australia, had not arrived at Suez, and consequently she is without the mails from that country; but she had on board the Bombay mail which reached Suiez on the 5th by the Aden, leaving the Valetta to bring on that from Clcuthta by the Hindostan, telegraphed on the 6th. The Cambhria was leaving Malta for Marseilles on the morning of the 10th, and woult convey 'be overland mail from Bombay, brought by the Jura, which was to leave for Southamptoaat 10 *.m, unless the Valetta came ia before 9 am. The Wanderer stsam gunboat, with a telegraph from the Consul at Alexandria, containing the Indian news, was despatched to Cagliari from Malta, at half-past 7 a.m. oa the 10th; but no newspaper expresses were allowed to ha carried by her. The Abeona scre w steam-transpert, which left 2dalta on the 6th for Gibraltar, conveyed the 48tb. The Killarney screw steamer had left for Tripoli, and the M.adinina and Eyptien (French) screw steamers had arrived, the former frem Tunis, t h latter from Beyrout, all vith general cargoes. A postscript of our correspondent's lebter of the 10th states that the Valetta was telegraphed at the momeont of the departure of the mail. The Falcon, 17, screw sloop, Commauder Campion, arived at Spithead yesterday morning from the West India station. The Datchman steamship arrived at Portsmouth yesterday with about 300 of the 68th Regiment frora the Ionlan Islands, and about 60 invalids, whom she landed. The remainder of the regiment vsill follow is a week or two. The Sarah Sands steamsbip, which was to have embarked the head-quarters of the 54th Regiment to-day at FortsmoUth, has been reported incapable of reeeiving the troops and etores she was certified to carry on survey, and the vessel has been found otherwise not in a fit state to receive them. The embareation of the troops is consequently delayed. The &astralian steamship embarked the head-quarters of the 42d Highlanders at Portsmouth yesterday afternoon, under the personal superintendence of Major-General the Hon. Sir James Yorke Scarlett, KC.B., the newly-appointed commander-in-cb;ef of the south-west district. T'he screw steam despatch gun-vessels Roebuck, Assurance, and Sparrowhawk, being fitted out at Portsmouth for Calcutta, have each had now mainmasts for the purpose of bark-rigging them. The sailmakers have been working overtime for the purpose of making new sails for them and altering the old ones; these are complete, and the vessels may be expected to be soon ready for sea. The Illustrious, 72, training ship for young officers and seamen, under the command of Captain Robert Harris, has been moved into Blockhouse-hole, off Gosport, for permanent berthing. Lieatenant-Colonel Charles James B. Riddell,appointed to the command of the field batteries of the Royal ArtUllery at Calcutta, is under orders to embark on the 4th proximo from Southampton. Captain Lambert H. Denne, Royal Artillery, is appointed Adjutant at Woolwich, vice Captain Calvert, about to proceed to India as Deputy-AssistantQuartermaster-GeneraL Rruiting for the various Indian regiments is proceeding very satisfactorily, a large number of fine young men having yesterday and the previous day joined the Indian dep6ta at Chatham.

The Admiralty steam-yachts Banshee and Black Eagle sailed' from Woolwioh on Thursday evening at 5 p.m. on special service for Portsmouth, whence it is expected they Wil be ordered to join the Royal squadron about to proceed on a cruise. The Netherlands Government paddlewheel steamship Cycloop, arrived at Woolwich yesterday morning from Helvoetsluys, to bo in attendance for the embarcation of Her Majesty the Queen of Holland, which it is expected will teke place to-moirow. Hier Majesty's paddlewheel steam tug-vessel Bustler, late tender to the Hiberniv was undocked yesterday at Wool. wich, and the steam-sloop Gorgon was saubequeatly docked in her place for repairs.

REVOCATION OF A CLERGYMAN'S LicNsE.-The Bishop of Rochester hae revoked the license of the Rev. Mr. west, the cm-ate of Hemel Hempsted, Hlertfordshire, undas somewhat singular circumntnces. It appears that for some months past differences have prevailed in reference to the mode of performing the services of the churoh, and much ill-feeling has conaequently been excited. Some time since Lr. West, the curate, refused to read the form of thanksgiving ordered by the Privy Council for the zafd delivery of Her Majesty, and representations were ma#ve to the Bishop of $Le diocess. A long correspondence took place between the Bishop and sone of the townspcople, who took ba active part in the matter, and the result has been that the Bishop has withdrawvn hlr. West's licenee to preach at the sam.e time prohibiting him from performing any rite or ceremony in or connected with the chLrch. TherroCoeedine which have been taken have not tended to slay the ill-feeling which prevailed,-indeed, it is generally admitted that the breach has been so far widened as to render any chance of reconciliation between the conflicting parties quite impossible.-Ohedmsford CQrronidc. BIUSTO1L SUGAR-MAium, Aug. 14.-Privately some few sales have been effeoted this week, but the market is still very dull, and prices are fully 2. lower. Refiners' vroduce, being in short supply, has not declined more than l.s per-omt,, at which a moderate amount of business has been dqne. Rum is rather dull of sale and rather easier.

MhOJ.3Y-MA RKBTand alTYIPi TBLLIGENCB. Friday Evening. The improvement in the funds has made further progress to-day, and there has been a better tone than at any time during the past two or three weeks. CoiSols for money, which closed last evening after regular hours at 90%, opened at 9uj to i. From this they temporarily receded to 90t, but soon again recovered to 90 to i. After the appearance of the second editiou of Thle Times and the delivery of the India letters, the upward movement was resnmed, and the last official transactions were at 9OO to J for money, and 91 for the account. At a later hour several further operations took place, and still greater buoyancy was exhibited, the final prices being 901 to 91 for money, and 91 i to J for t-he accoint. The publio continued to make investments, and, many of the speculative purchases lately open having been suddenly closed during the deplession of the past few days, the market has assumed an appearance of comparative stability. Loans on Government securities were ia slightly increased demand, but the rate was not above 5 per cent. In the discount-market there was a fair supply at a fraction below the Bank charges, although in the afternoon there were numerous applications at that establishment. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 216; Reduced, 91k to j; New Three per Cents., 91 - to g; Tndia Stock, 212 to 213; India Bonds, 26s. to 20s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, os. to is. discount. This has been settling day in the foreign stockmarket, but the transactions have again been few. A further advance occurred in Turkish, which closed with great firmness at an improvement of about J per cent. Russian Five per Cents. were negotiated at J12i ; Mexican, 22i; Portuguese, 45A-; Sardinian, 89; Spanish Certilicates, 5 ; Turkish Six per Cents., Ui4j; ditto, for the account, 94j and 95k.; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 99i; and for the account, 99g. In the foreign exchanges there was no alteration of importance. In the corn-market this morning there was a recovery of is. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a steady business at former rates. The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. for money and 67f. 20c. for the end of the month, showing a fractional improvement. The gold withdrawn from the Bank to-day was only about 5,00911. The Bombay portion of the India mail has not arrived. This has occasioned considerable inconvenience. It appears that the Aden, with the Bombay mails, reached Suez 19 hours before the lindostan with those from Calcutta, and that the authorities at Alexandria, in the hope of effecting an acceleration, detained the Jura, which had been awaiting at Suez the arrival of the Australian steamer, and was posted to leave Alexandria on the 5th, until 3 p.m. of the following day, when she wvas despatched with the Bombay mails from the Aden, to be transshipped to the Cambria at Malta for Marseilles. The Camnbria arrived at Marseilles this morning, but the Valetta, which left Alexandria on the 7th, had previously delivered the Calcutta and China mails brought by tbe Hindostan. If the Bombay mails by the Cambria were despatched by the 10 a.m. train of to-day from Marseilles, their delivery may be expected to-morrow afternoon. The private letters from CalCutta. are dated the 4th of July, and are all written in a more confident spirit. It appeats, however, that even up to that date the delusion as to the fall of Delhi still existed, although it is now positively known from Bombay that no attack had been made. The daily arrival of troops was beginning to create a feeling of perfect security, and the native dealers would apparently have been disposed to resume on a moderate scale their purchases of goods forthe up-country markets, but for the impossibility of finding means of conveyance. Prices had not experienced any further decline, and importers abstained from forcing sales. Cartloads of fugitives, consisting principally of women and children, in a state of complete destitution, continued to reach the city from the disturbed districts. The return of the Bank of France this month is again unfavourable, the bullion which exhibited a falling off of 895,0001. in the preceding month now showing a further reduction of (390,00th. The stock held is consequently reduced to 9,805,0001. The note liabilities have increased 38,0001., the advances on stocks 32,0001., and those on railroads 242,0001. The disciunts also have been extended 652,0001., and the demand for money is likewise evidenced by a diminution of 207,0001. in the deposits of the public. The Treasurybalance has increased 192,0001., and an advance of 200,0001. made to the Government appears to have been repaid. Notwithstanding the large falling off in the bullion, 12,0001. has been expended in premiums for the purchase of gold. A meeting of the creditors of Messrs. Forster, Rutty, aial, and Co., warehousemen, who failed on the4th inst., was held to-day, Mr. Hyrnan in the chair, when the following statement was submitted by Mr. Parrinton, the accountant:- SrAhENmT or Toix AFFAIRS 0oR MESSRS.

It was also stated that the books had been kept in a most unsatisfactory manner, and that no balance had been struck at any perid. The account shows adeficiency of 37,9301., and, in answer to a question, Mr. Rutty admitted that for some years past the firm have been trading at an annual loss. After some discussion a declaration of insolvency was signed, and the concern was ordered to be wouyd up under a deed of inspectorship. At a meeting of the English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank to-day, Mr. C. Johnston in the chair, the report and accounts were adopted unanimously, and a dividend was declared for the past half.year at the rate of ' per cent, per annum, free of income-tax. The chairman congratulated the shareholders upon their improved prospects, the progress of the bank being most stisfactory. He remarked that not only are the profits sufficient to give an increased dividend,butthatthe characterand importanceof the business are much higher, and that the losses by bad debts are considerably reduced. A diseusion ensued upon the nature of the audit of the accounts, when bMr. Cazenove, one of the -auditors, explained that he had personally examined all the aJets in this country, and that the statement of the assets in the colony was verified by a comparison of the inspector's report and manager's books. Weeldy examinations are also made by the local directors. In answer to a question, the cbairnasn stated that the amount taken for directors' remuneration for the pat halfyear is 1,0001. ; the sum provided for this purpose is 3,0001. s-year, but it is not considered advisable to appropriate the whole until the profits beoome larger. Annexed is an abstract of the report and accontu:- 1 T4e directors plae before the proprietors the awcom. pADDIs statement of the awttunts of the bank, which hare been verified by the auditors, and report the result of the, operations for the six months ending in the colonieo on the 31st of March, and in London on the 30th June, exhibitinig the steady progress of 'the bank, as will be seen by compar. ing the present balance-sheet with those submitted at pre. vious meetings. The directorsjhave the satisfaction to state that the estimated losses during the period under review have been very small, and to add that the latest returns received from the branches continue to show an extension of business. They therefore recommend the following appropriation of the balance at credit of profit and loss account, viz :-To the payment of a dividend At the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, free of income-tax, on f00,0001., the paid-up capital, 16,0001. ; towards the reduction of the amounts at debit of-preliminary expenses 5001., bank premises and furniture accounts 1,0001. ; leaving 3,6401. to be added to the reserve fund, which will then amount to 7,6561. The measureintroduced by the local Government for the formation of a bank of issue in the colony of Victori, which if established might have interfered with the privileges of 'existing banks, has not been proceeded with.

It is mentioned that, owing to the disorganized condition of financial affairs in Turkey during the last six months, the directors have considered it expedient to abstain as much as possible from exchange operations, and that the business at the Asiatic branches continues steadily to increase. The colonial produce-markets during the week have presented a quiet appearance, with an occasional tendency to lower prices, the chief exceptions being for those few articles directly influenced by the intelligence just received from India. Sugar is extremely dull, as the trade evince no desire to extend their purchases, even at a further decline of 1. 6d. to 3s. The sales of plantation Ceylon coffee showed a reduction of fully Is. Cocoa is firmer. The tea-market has been rather inactive. For common congou the quotation is still is. 2;d. per lb. Some orders have been executed in the lower grades of green for shipment to Canada. The intelligence by the overland mail is considered as decidedly in favour of holders here. White kinds of Bengal rice have sold to a moderate extent only, and at barely former quotations. Spice is without alteration. Saltpetre closes at an advance of 2s, 6d. to 35., with few sellers. Bengal to arrive has realized to-day 52s. per cwt. A cargo of nitrate of soda has found buyers at or rather under 20s. per cwt. Many parcels of indigo have been withdrawn from the market, and the views of holders are too high to admit of much businews, although transactions are reported at 6d. per lb. above the July rates. According to the circular of M. Arles Dufour, of Lyons, business in silk of every description continues limited, neither the disturbances in India, on the one hand, nor the prospect of a large crop in China on the other, having exercised any very decided influence. At the present high rates manufacturers will restrict their consumption to the smallest possible quantity until about September or October, when it is expected spring orders for the IUnited States may give an impulse to the demand, The following letter by the Brazil mail gives the latest account of commercial matters in the River Plate. It is dated Montevideo, the 4th of July .- "The fever, as was anticipated, has left us. Somo measures are in operation to remove the danger of its re-appearance next summer, but they are scarcely adequate. As I auggested, the suspension of the repayment of the guaranteed loan bas been removed, but unless this Government is unmistakeably made to understand that Her Majesty's Government will not submit to any further spoliation of British subjects under any pretext whatever, having once inserted the -wedge, they will, be assured, attempt to drive it home. Here are already symptoms of a desire to make a clean sweep. I belive that Mr. Thornton, Her Majesty's Charg6 d'A6haires, ishalf sorry thathe submitted to the recent infraction of his contract, and has made up his mind not to allow it to form a precedent. It is admitted now that he committed a mistake, but it must be con. fessed that the excitement was great, and the Government comprehended howto take advantage of it. The unscrupulous advocacy on the part of one of the newspapers, edited by a friend of the mis-calltd Liberal party, of a declaration of bankruptcy is a sign of the further degeneracy of these people. Whatever they may have thought privately in the matter, the Montevideams, at least, never before ventured to give utterance to such disreputable opinions. Such conduct they left to the Buenos Ayreans. In justice, however, to Montevideo, it must be stated that the individual who advocates these principles is the same who promulgatt d them in Buenos Ayres in opposition to a reasonable arrange. ment with the) English bondbolders. He is a doctor of laws -a class of people that have done more mischief in the South American republics than the military chiefs. I forgot to mention in my last that while these legislators were pass. ing a law to take money from the foreigners under pretext of requiring the, money for sanitary purposes, they actually endeavoured to increase their own emoluments by making a law that 15p er cent. of the Customs should be paid over to them in lien of 10 per cent., as at present. As Sidney Smith sai(d of the inbabitants of another part of the world these people are ' willing to lHe under any load of infamy however great, rather than impose upon themselves any burthen of taxation, however Hght.' The revenue last month was less than usual; but the Customs are expected to produce a large sum in the present month. It is ascertained that the number of cattle slaughtered here during the past season exceeded 120,000, vworth about 400,000?. to the tanceros, who are now becoming rich, and are buying more land, which is rising in price. In fact, the country is going ahead in spite of mismanagement. Considerable numbers of sheep were brought over from Buenos Apres during the summer, and sbeep-farming is becoming an iaportant branch of industry and a mine of wealth. Immi. gration only is required. " From Buenos Ayres there is no news worth relating. All is quiet, and it is hoped there will be no interruption to the general tranquillity. Business, which with us has been brisk, is there rather dull." At theo Court of Bankruptcy to-day the discharge of lMr. Humphrey Brown was ordered. The whole of the directors, as also the general manager of the Royal British Bank, against whom indictments are to be preferred, have now obtained their freedom, with the exception of Mr. Cochran, wvho has avoided arrest and the necessity of giving baiL The return from the Bank of England for the week ending the 8th of August gives the following resuita when compared with the previoum week:- Public deposits ...- ... £ 6,300,771 ..Incr se £935,454 Other deposits ... ... 10,263,335..

EICOND EDITION. TB TIMRS-OFPI , S Jturcd,oj 'Mwin. EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris coreapondet, dated yesterday (Wrday), 6 p.m.: In his Dictimaire Hioriqz.e de la Ville de Paris el de ses EBvirons, published in 1779, Hurtant oberves, in the article Louvre- "This castle Is without contradiction,l the first Royal mansion In France. The etymoloy of its naame is uncerlain. Accoiding to some it means 1Vou?rage par ervcuenc, or the c4ef.d'avre ; in other words, 1'muvre de l'ouvrmge. Somo have recours to the Saxon language, and maintai that in Saxon Louvre means ch&teau. Others derive It from the fact that the site of the building was in other times a repcir for wolves, and hence wo find in ancient titledeeds the name .upaca applied to it. Be that as it may, the name was aftew .vards extended to all the Royal red. fnces.,, Whatever be the opinion of antiqutaries, the early history of the Louvre remains involved in great obscurity. The namu of its founder and the date of its erection Ure alike unknown to us; and the first notice of it on record is in the 7th century, when we are told that Dagobert kept in it his Ihorses and hounds. The fai7eans Kings often visited it. These Royal personages, who reserved all their energies for the table, rode in a waggon through tho forest which then covered this aide of ,the Seine, and returned by the river, fishing along the way, to the city, where they supped and slept. The Louvre is passed over in silence under the oecond and third race of Kines, and we only find it mnentioned under Philip Augustus. In 1204 that 3?rince convelbod It into a fortrcss, surroundcd with ditches and flark-ed with towers. The central building, called the Grosse Tour du Louvre, de- olished by Francis I., was the keep. It was to this spot the feudal barons and dependents of the Crown came to do homage and take the oath of fealty. Hence it was said that the estates of Lordships were held of the Great Tower of the Louvre, and the formula long survived its destruction. It was also used as a prison; and Jobn de Moatfort, who disputed the Duchy of Brittany with Charles of Blois, Charles the Wicked Eing of Navarre, and several Counts of Flanders, were confined in it at different periods. The walls of Paris, erected by Philip Augustus, did not comprise the Louvre. It remained outside of the city for 600 years. It was enclos^d in 1367 under Charles V., and completed in 1383 by Charles VI. Charles F. spent 55,000 livres in elevating the building, and renderinug the apartments more commnodious, but it was under Charles IX. that it became the ordinary habitation of Royalty. It was also reserved as a lodging for foreign Princes who might visit France. Manuel, Emperor of Constan. tinople, 9ad Sigismund, Emperor of Germany, had apartments intheLouvredurin,theirsojourn inParis. Uhnder Charles V. the Palace formed a parallelograma measuring 360 fcetby34S. It was then surrounded by a moat, which the Seine aupplied, and contained ranges of buildings, a principal Court, several inferior Courts, and gardens. In 1420, the English thre?tening to attack Paris, Charles VI. demolished the great tower, called the Chastel du Bois, and filled up the ditches, in order to afford the inhabitants access to the Tour du Coin, to defend theun, selves. Nearly all the towers that composed the building had their warders, who were nobles, many of whom had chapels and chaplains. The entrance to the Louvre was by four fortified gates, called pertca.t. The principal entrance faced the bank of the Seine, and between the river and the building stood a gate flanked with towers, which opened upon a large Court, bordered by parts of the palace ditch, In the centre of the facade was another gate, fortified by two low towers, covered with a terrace. This gate was decorated by Charles VI. with his own statue, and that of hisfather, Charles V., which stood in niches. Francis L receivcdjthe Emperor Charles V. at the Louvre with much magnificence and honour. Charles IXL, Hemny III., Henry IV., and Louis XIII. inhabited it and added to its buildiugs. Nothing remains of the old chateaua of Philip Augustus which Charles V. repaired; it is believed that the most ancient part now in existence is that called the Vieu', Louvre, began by Francis I. in 1539 and fiuished by Henry IL in 1548. Louis XIV. resolved to complete the Palace of the Louire and the grand gallery along the banks of the Seine. Levau, the first architect to the King, drew the plans of the work, which did not satisfy Colbert, and all the architects of Paris were invited by the Minister to inspect them and to present original designs. The Mfinister declared that he would adopt that which should be judged superior 5n merit. The plans were exhibited in public; they were all fine, but one alone obtained universal admirvtion. It was the work of Claude Perrault who, though educated as a physician, had a genixu for, and excelled in architecture. Even this did not satisfy Colbert, who resolved to consulf the great masters of Italy, and invite them to send de. signs. They did so, but none of the plans were Upproved, with the exception of those of Berabin, who excelled alike in painting, sculpture, and architecture. Louis XIV., with his own Royal hand, wrote the following letter of invitation to the architect:- " Signor Chevalier Bernini,-I have so high an esteem Tor yonr talents that I have a great desire to see and to be acquainted with so illustrious a person, provided my desire can be recondled with the duty which you owe zo our Holy Father the Pope, and with your own convenience. I have, therefore, sent this courier to you on purpose to re. quest you will afford me this satisfaction and undertake a journey to France by taldng advantage of the favourable occasion of the return of my cousin the Duke of Crequi, Ambassador Extraordinary, who wi11 explain to you more particulvely the obje At for which I w,sh to see you, and to converse with you on the beautiful designs you have sent me for the building of the Louvro; as to other particular5 and my kind intentions towards you I refer you to mny cousin above mentioned. I pray God to have yon ia his holy keeping, Si&aeur Cavalier Bernini. ' Paris, April 11, lG65." The honours paid to Bernini rfell little short of those offered to Royalty itself. The Duke of Crequi, Ambaasador to. the Pope, after taking leave of His Holiness, went in state to Bernini'a house, and rcquested him to accompany him to France. In every town through which he passed he was, by order of the King, received 'with great honours, and presents were made to him. Persons were sent from the Court to prepare his meals on the road, and, as he approached Paris, the Lord of Chantelon, Grand Steward of the Royal Household, went out to celve him. His plans were of course adopted, and on the 17th of October, 1665, the Eing himself laid the first stone of theffafade with great splendour. A gold medal of the value of 2.400f. was enclosed in the stone. When the building reached above the ground Bernini obtained leave to return home, " not wisbhig to pass the winter in a place so cold as Paris.'" The day previous to his departure the King sent lbim a,present of 3,000 louisd'or, a warrantfor a pensionof 12,000 livres, and anotherof 1,200for hes aon Iu spite of al this the original design of the physician Perrault for the favade was partialy adopted. The front towards the Seine was erected after his plans, and that facing the Rue du Coq was also partly built by Perrault. Iouus XV. inhabited the Louvre during his (I4 hood in the year 1709, while some repair wore being made in the PaLce of the Tuleries. Under the first Fhrpre the Louvre wa &wider. ably repaired and embellshed, and the tympani= :~~ ~ ~~~~ . 1 ------ of the pediment, which had not bezn finished, was adorned with a bas-relief, 'the work of Lenol Under the Restoration much was done towards its completion. On the 17th of February, 1820, and the four following day;, the remins of the Dukeof Beri, assassinated by Louvel on' the night of the 13th, were laid in state in the southern quadrangle of the Louvre. The first Napoleon always intended to connect the Paleze of the Tuileries with that of the Louvre, which, with the gallery towards the Seine, formed three sides of an immense parallelogram, by carrying[out a line of building uniform with the gallery from the opposite extremity of the Tuileries to the other side of the Louvre. It is this gigantic work that is now finished under his successor, Napoleon III., and which forms an Imperial residence not, perhaps, surpassed by any edifice in Europe. The Emperor nat ralyldesired that the ceremony of the inauguration of the Louvre should coincide with the anniversay of the birth of his uncle, which he has adopted as his own fte. The inscriptions intended to commemorate the date of the foundation of the Palace of the Louvre were, by a curious coincidence, only discovered yesterday. To them is added the date of its completion. Both are now affixed to the front of the Pavillon Sully, which is right opposite the central Pavillon-the Pavillon' de l'Horloge-of thePalace of the Tuileries. Theyare engraved in golden letters on slabs of black marble, and are t) this effect:-" 1541, Francis L commences the Louvre ; 1564, Catherine de Medicis conmmencts the Tuileiies; 1852-1857, Napoleon III. connects the Tuileries with the Louvre." The ceremony of inauguration took place this day at 2 o'clock. Long before that hour crowds of people thronged the Rue de Rlyoli, the quays, and the other approaches to the Palace. The Place du Carrousel, from the triumphal arch of the Tuileries down to the Pavilion Sully, was occupied by troops -the National Guard on the left, and the Zonaves and a battalion or two of the line to the right. The entrance was by, the Pavillon Denon (the pavilions .-re named after men distinguished in the arts and sciences), which is to the right of the Pavilion Suly. The entrance was beautifully decorated for the occasion. The first object that met the aisitor on passing the doorway was a bust in white marble of Napoleon I., standing on a pedestal of the same material. On each side was a medallion supported by halberds-one with the name of Francis I., amrmounted by a salamander, and the other that of Napoleon IIL, surmounted by an eagle, both resting on banks of flowers. The gallery in which the ceremony was held is on the first landing over the ground floor. You ascend to It by a flight of steps. On each side were groups of ancient statuary, borrowed from the Museum; and from the rez-de-chaussde to the landing-place the stairease was flanked by the Cent Gardes, dressed in their beautiful uniform, and who stood so still and motioDless that they also might have been mistaken for statues. Both sides all the way up were lined with shrubs and flowers. The gallery is not yet finished; but painted canvass and hangings re-. placed the more solid and permanent ma'erials which are yet to come. The ceiling was hung with flags of various colours and forms, and the walls were covered half up the heighb with the tapestry of the Gobelins. The floor was covered with rich carpetiug, and lines of benches of crimson [velvet, rising over each other, were placed on both sides. On the right were the seats reserved for the senators, deputies, councillors of state, and other civil functionaries. The officers of the army were accommodated bn the upper benches to the left; lower down sat the ladies, and the other persons invited to the ceremony, among whom was a considerable namber of tihe worling classes, particnlarly thoxe employed in the building of the Louvre. Along the walls were affixed eacocheons surmounted by eagles and support^d by flags, and displaying the initials of the Emperor. About 1 o'clock the Ministers, the Mfarshals of France, Generals of Divisions, and great functionaries of State began to arrive. Marsh-1 Pelissier was early in attendance. He was at once recognized. His hair, white as snow, cut close, and contrasting with his black eyebrows and moustache, dark eyes, face bronzed by the sun of Africa, and determined expression of countenance, have long made him familiar to the public. HE was dressed in his Marshal's uniform, with the Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honour, the Star of the Bath, the Crimean medal, and other numerous orders. Marshal Bosquet, who, by the way, is growing rather bulky, followed soon after, and Marshal Canrobert, short, bulky, and good-natured looking, his face, as usual, uplifted, and his eyes continualy in motion, as if the gallant Gascon was anxious to have a chatj with every one they lighted upon. At half-past 1 all the great personages of the day had arrivod. Exactly at 2 o'clock the drums beat to arms as a signal that the Emperor, punctlal to a moment, as ever, was approaching, and a cry of "Vtive VB7aperew !" from the crowd below announced that he was already at the entrance. The buzzing of conversation was at once hushed, and all turned in sllence towards the entrance. M. Fould, Minister of State and of the Imperial Household, -was at the gates to receive him. In a few minutes the Grand Chamberlain called out "L'EnipereurP' and the next moment His Majesty, dressed in military uniform, made his appearance. All stood up, and the cry of "7ivel'Emp&retr!"ranthroughthe hall. TheEmperor was accompanied by the Empress, and followed by Prince Nspeleon, the Princess Mathilde, the Prince and Princess Murat, and a long array of chamber. lains and officers of the household. 'The Emperor advanced to the extremity of the hall, where a throne waR placed on a platform covered with crimson velvet, with another by its side for the Empress, and on both sides faideuils for the Princes of the Imperial family. The Emperor invited the assembly to be seated, and took his seat on the throne. Business was opened without a minuWs delay. M. Foluld stood up and read from a paper the following ,speech, in which a rapid sketch was given of the beginning and completion of the buildngs, from 1852 to the present timae :- ; Sixe,-When your Sajiedy ordered the junction of the Louvre to the Toileries you expressed a desire that it should be completed mi five years. The desi of the Emperor has been accomplished. The fir6t stone was laid on the 26th o: July, 1852, and now on the 14th August 1857, the Louvre and Tufleiies form only one pae. "Neither the wre, nor the other difficulties which we have had to go through, have interrupted this work, the dream of so many Kings, and which would sufflce for the glory of a period of peace and prosperty. It has not It formed any obstacle to those vast and useful waderbal 'ngs which under the Inspiration of your Mfajesty have been formed throughout the -whole of France. The net-work of our railways has been rapidly extended, our ports enlarged and fortified, onrlarge towns rendered healthy and enmiched with splendid and useftl buildings, the capital transformed, large streets opened, a magnificent promenade formed on *a ungrateful soil, and everywhere progress for the -welfare of all-such is the spectacle which the country presents sinee it has placed its destinies in the hands of a Sovereign whose genius has known how to compre, Lend and to satisfy the true wants of France, Thanks h the zea of all the Agents of the Admnitraiion, to tae ativity of the contractors, and the shlll of the work. men, the works have gone on without any intelrpti,on; and the execution of the Cahkcr des CMrgesJ, although tbh prices had been estblished before, the rise in price of the materials and of labour has not given rise to any dispute- 'Che administation has shown itself just, ad hag -only had to praise tho good faith of the contactors. tour X&esty, whose presence at the wore hbs frequently excited the ardour of the worknen, wishd once more to se them assembled around you, after the coi. pletion of their task. All presa with happiness round your MaesWy, all are conscious of havlng done their duty and ae proud of haing had their part in this truly national work. Your Majesty no longer sees at their head the eminent artist whom you had selected to complete the Louvre. A premature deatb, in striking him four yeas agro, at the com. mencement of ibis great undertaking, deprived him of the honour of oompletIng it. ML. euel,rwho was de.lguatad by your Majesty as his successor, has the glory of having ter- tiuated it, and his name will remain attaohed with tlvit of Visconti to the monument which we now inaugr-ate, The death of Visonti is not the only circumstance of which this ceremony reminds us. Th-: year even we have lost Jemar, an artist at onoe bold and correct, and whose last compositions r ithe earlatides of the Pavillon do 1'Horloge, and the handsome pediment of the Pavillon Denon. 5 During the course of these works I have more than once pointed out to your Majesty the intelligence and the zeal of al those who have taken part in them. I have been permitted again to mention the names of those who have more particularly distinguished themselves, and to whom your Majesty has deigned to accord recomF anse " These recompenses will not only honour those to whom they are awarded; they must also flatter the branch of industry or the bodies of the State to whioh they belorg. At once pronal and collective, tbeee medals, distributed by your Majesty inl person, will be for those who have completed their taskja precious testimony of the august satisfaction of the Emperor." Thelistwasthenreadof the personsengagedinthese important works, whomthe Minister recommended aa worthy of special marks of the Emperor's approvaL The names -were nu merous, and comprised everyclass, from the principal architect, sculptor, and painter, to the working mechanic-all, in fact, who excelled in their respective branches. These persons advanced as their names were called, and each received from the hands of the Emperor the Cross of Commander, Officer, or Knight of the Legion of Honour. Loud applause fo!lowed the recitsl of several of the names. Each recipient, as the decoration was delivered to him, bowed to the Emperor and Empress, who returned the salute most gracefully. The Emperor and Empress then stood up, and His Majesty read, in a firm and distinct voice, the following address:- " Gentlemen,-I congratulate myself with you on the complotion of the Louvre. I congratulate myself especially upon the causes which have rendered it possible. In fact it is order, restored stability, and ever increasing prosperity of the con--try which have enabled me to complete this national work. I call it so because the Governments which have succeeded each other, have made it a point to do something towards the completion of the Royal dwelling commenced by Francis L, embellished by Henry IL ' Whence this perseverance, and even this popularity in the building of a palace ? It is because the character of a people is reflected in its institutions as in its customs, in the events 'that excite its enthusiasm as well as in the monuments which become the object of its chief interest. Now France, monarohical for so many centuries, which always beheld in the Central Power the represenkAtive of her grandeur and of her nationality, wished that the dwelling of the Sovereign should be worthy of the country, and the best means of tesponding to that sentiment was to adorn that dwelling with the different masterpieces of the human intelligence. " In the middle-ages the King dwelt in a fortress, bristling with defensive works; but soon the progress of cisilization superseded battlements, and the produce of letters of the arts and science took the place of weapons of war. *' Thus the history of monuments has also its philosophy as well as the history of events. " In like manner that lit is remarkable that at the time of the first revolution the Committec of Public Welfare should have continued, without being aware of It, the work of Louis XL, of Richelieu, of Louis XIV., giving the last blow to the feudal system, and carrying out the system of unity and centra3lzation, the constant aim of Monarchyin like manner is there not) a great lesson to learn in beholding the idea of Heny IV., of Louis MIL, of Louis XIV., of Louis XV., of Louis XVL, of Napoleon, as regards the Louvre, adopted by the ephemeral power of 1848? One of the first acts, in fact, of the Provisional Government was to d&2ree the completion of the palace of our Kings. So true is it that a nation e-aws from its antecedents, as an individual deiives from his education, ideas which the prssions of a moment do not succeed in destroying . When a moral Impulse is the consequence of the social condition of a country it is hauded down through centurieu, and through different forms of governnent, until the object in view is attained. " Thus the c'mpletion of the Louvre, towards which I thauk you for your co-operation,given with so much zeal and skill, is not the caprice of a moment, but is the realization of a plhn conceived for the glory, and kept alive by the instict, of the couutry for more than 300 years." The whole ceremony lasted about three-quarters of an hour. The Emperor and Empress descended from the platform andreturned as they came, their Majesties bowing on both sides as they passed down the gaUery; and, amid cries of Vive PBmperewr, itve PImptratrice, and a few of Vive le Prince Imperial, quitted the building. They Ldrove to the Palace in the Tuileries, close at hand, and afterwards set out for St. Cloud. Among the appointments to the rank of General on the occasion of the Emperor's f4te is mentioned the name of Colonel Joachim Amhert, well known for his numerous works on military subjects. According to the last despatches from Vienna the Austrian Government is disposed to consent that new elections shall take place ju Moldavia, but i; proposes that the electoral lists shall be prepared on a different system from that suggested by the other Powers. The consent, however, of the Austrian Government to have new elections is an lmpox lant fact. Prince Vogorides, IKP"aleran ol Moldavia, has just been decorat.d with the Order of the Medjidi6 of the first class. The health of Rear-Admiral de Chabosuaes not permitting him longer to hold his command in Algiers, Admiral Fourichon has been appointed to aucceed him. It is announced that Vice-Admiral Charner is to be appointed to a maritime prefecture. The latest accounts from Cayenne announce that the modality in that colony is very great at present. The Emperor, on the occasion of his fete, has granted pardons, comrmutations, or rcduction of punishment to 1,142 persons confined at the bagnes anud other penitentiary establishments. The Monifeur contains an ImperhsL decree making a number of promotions and appointmenth in the bigher ranks of the magistracy.

MX Laity, ex-Prefect of the Basses-Pyrenees, and General Dumas, Counbillor of State and Director of the Affairs of Algeria, have been raised to the dignity of senator. Cardinal Morlot, Archbishopof Paris, has been named Grand Almoner to the Emperor. Mgr.

The same day a trial of a nerWly invented lamp, called " the wonderful submaiine lamp," was made on board the ship-of. the-line Eylau, in presence of a cormmission appointed to report on the result. The lamp was let down three feet under water and the light which it cast around enabled the visitors to examine the copper bottom of the ship, its joints, and rivets. The lamp wws then let down 24 feet, and continned to burn all the time of the experiment, which lasted two hours a-nd a half. Several trifling repairs may be effected on the bettom of a ship by means of this lamp. It will be particularly useful likewise in extricating the screw of a steamer from a rope twisted round it or from any other impediment.

In my letter of yesterday it was said that the Russian Government had always considered the union or non-union;of the Danubian Principalities a matter of inferior importance, and tbe Oest. Zeitub s I o-day contasus information which tends to confir, my asserLion. On the 26th of March, 1855, Baron Bourqueney submitted to the Vienna Conference a plan which had been drawn up by hI. Drouyn do Lhuys for the uniorn of Moldavia and Wallachia. that the union project was considered nnfavourable to Russia cannot well be doubted, as M de Boarqueney expresscd himself to the effect, that in the " Memoraadum principles were developed tending to insure the realization of theguarantees which had been. given." Prince Gortschakoff replied, that Russia was only bound by the four " paraphzf1" points, and refrained from exprcssing any opinion as to the merits of the union project. It subsequently became lkno'n to the Russian statesman that the Porte and Austria were greatly averse from the idea of the union, and he at once sawthat by skilLul management he should be able to sow the seedi of dissension in the camp of the allies Ee accordclugly, when Minister for Foreign Affais, instructed Count Orloff not to say anything at the Paris Conference about the union project, until he had acquired positive information as to the intentions of the French Government. " When," said the Russian Minister, " you know the resolve which France has taken, you will give her your full and unconditional support." The next move of Russia was to direct her various organ, at home and abroad, to represent Austria as the sole obstacle to the realization of the plan for the union of the two Principalities. The British Cabinet, however, speedily saw through the manCeuvres of Russia, and considered it advisable to make common cause with. Austria in defending the Porte against such an unjustifiable attack on her iategrity as the union of Moldavia and Wallachia would be. Russia has played her cards so well that she cannot, however the union question may be settled, fail to be a gainer. If the two provinces are united, the union party will attribute the realization of its wisbes to Russia, and if they remain separate the odium will fall on England and Austria. The relations between Austeia and Prussia have long been unfriendly, but the recent conduct of the latter in the matter of the Danubian Principalities has greatly widened the breach. The Austrian organs of the press unanimously denounce the " un-German policy of the Prussian Government, and the VoUiskfretnd, the organ of the all. powerful and almost omniscient clerical party, contaius the following oracular menace:- "There is perhaps still time for preserving Germany from- tie misfortune of an open quarrel between Prussia and Austia. May this time be taken advantage of in Berlin, for If once the alliruce of Prussia with Russia is afaitaccom.pli,* it will be too late, and the destiny of Pr',..ia'wil be accomplished." We learn that the organination and arming of the Russian " Ohasseur" battalions and companies proceed but slowly, and it is by no means difficult to believe that such is the case. Thirty-six separate battaliort, and as many companies as there are battalions of the line, are to be formed, and armed 'with the best rifles that can be procured for money. The flotilla in the Caspian, which is under the command of Rear-Admiral Wulf, is composed of 20 transport barques and eight steamers. Several new vessela are being buiLt at Astrachan, and there is a regular naval establishment on the island of Ashoorada,t)-Wich is at no great' distance from Asterabad. ; In virtue of the Currency Treaty between Austria nd the other German States the Vienna Bank will -have to resume its cash paymants on the 1st of Januaiy; 1859, but it is by no means clear to me that it will be in a position to do so with safety. at present the reserve fund of the Bank is but 94,500,000f., with a paper circulation of nearly 394,000o00ofl. The moneyed world is of opinion that the Bank would speedily get out of its difficulties if it were to raise a loan on the domains ceded' to it by the State, bat it is doubtful whether Government would authorize it to do so. The doiaains in question are valued at 155,000,OoOfl., and there would hardly be any great difficulty in obtaining a loan on them if it were what is-here called a " lottery loan." The loan which was contracted in 1854 bears interest at 4. per cent., and the holders of shares (d 250fL) besides play once a year in a lottery in which there are 4,000 tide.kts. In the lottery, in which there are no blanks, the igghest prize is 200,000fL, and the lowest 300fl. The 1854 loan was emitted at 95, but it now stands at 109, although the 5 per cent. National Loan is down to 8Q. As you have already been informed, the havest has been extremely good, but the drought has been so great in some parts of the empire that there is a uad want of fodder. In Moravia the landed proprietors *It was somae t4ys shoce axinou-ted that the King of Prumsa,while here strongly recommnended the renewalof the H Toly Aliandie. t This Waand is not marked on any ofmny maps. are xeducrng their flocks and herd, an they forages that they shaU have great difficulty in procuring food for them duting the% inter. Some yewr ago there was such a t3rrible dearth of fodder in Moravia, that many of the shcep were literally starved to death, but an ingenious nobleman of my acquaintance managed to keep all his heep alive by mixing -wth their uual food leaves which he had gathered from the trees in summer, and dried like bay in the sun. On the 10th there were v;nom festivities at Oedenburg, in honour of His Majesty, the Emperor, who, at 6 in the moruing of the 11th, oontinued his journey to Kormend. There has bn a great deal of rain in Lower Hungary, but the drought is now so great that the navigation of the Danube I for larger vcssels is likely to be interrupted. It here occurs to me that the Queen's messengers accomplish their journey from Bucharest to Vienna, and vce versa, in 76 hours, which rate of travelling is about as fatiguing as canal digging. On the 9th the Archduchess Charlotte received the notables of Trieste, and won their hearts by thanking them in excellent Italian for the hearty reception which had been given her by the citizens on her arrival. The Tiester Zeitung speaks of the Prinoes, as "the daughter of a land which enjoys the blessings of liberty and order." According the cazeffa di Milano, the ramour of the great insecurity of the roads in Lombardy has arisen from the fact of two highway robberis having been committed by a certain StringhenL The band of the gentleman in question stopped the " diligence" between Cremona and Mantua, but eight of the malefactors have since fallen into the hands of the gendarmerie.
