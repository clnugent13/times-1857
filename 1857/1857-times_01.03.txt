STATE OF TRADE. MANChESTER, JtN. 2. The continued rise of cotton places both manufacturers and merchants in a difficulty, becaus the cost of production is approaching a point which must seriously limit the ue of cotton fabrics. The businn donein ourn market this morning=hs consequently been on a small scale. This is particulnoticeable in the demand for long cloth, T clao, and domestics, for all i3f which transactions have been con. fned to mited quantities Thero is stll a moderate demand for printing cloths, and sellers are firm in requiring full rates. For all kinds of shirtings the market is veryfirn, pcesbeingratherhigherthanlast week. Thebea. ncersuakes of 40-i,ch for Chinx have been less inquired for in consequence of tbe news from Canton In yarns buyers have oeen unwilling to give the increased rate of id. to 3d. per lb. required to cover the extra cost of cotton, but sellrs are wecll under orders for the nresent, wvith light stocks, and are indif,'erent aboult newr business unless the huyer is con. tent to accept tbe new terms. The demand is from al markets, home and foreign, and a large trade would be done at easier rxtes.
MONBY-M.ABKB and CITYINTBLLIGENC. Friday Evening. The English funds have shown dulness to-day, and the transactions have been unimportant. Con- . Is, which left off last evening at 94i to J, opened a' 94 to i, and remained without variation to the c. e of business. For the 5th of February the price V.is 94i to ,. Bank Stock closed at 216 to 218: 1 .duced, 941 to i; New Three per Cents., 940 to i; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to 7; India Bond>, 2s. discount to 2s. premium; and Exchequer-bills, Is. discount to 3s. premium. The demand for money to-day was moderate, and in some exceptional cases transactions took place at 51 per cent. The payment of the dividends at the Bank wi]l ccmmence on Thursday, the 8th inst. Foreign securities were less firm to-day, and the operations were generally limited. In Turkish Six per Cents. the bargains took place at 95-i for money, snd 95. and i for the account. There were no transactions in the Four per Cents. Guaranteed. Mexican, for the account, 21i ; Peruvian Four-and. a-Half per Cents., 78; Portuguese Three per Cents., 43i; Russian Five per Cents., 107; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 95i; Sardinian Five per Cents., 88; Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents, 9)6 : Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 64i; and thqEtour per Cent. Certificates, 971. in the foreign exchanges this afternoon bills upon Paris we! e rather more in demand. With regard to other places there was no alteration of importance. The corn-market was very dull this morning at the rates of Monday. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows an extensive business, at an advauce of fully id. per lb. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this eveing were 66f. SOc. for money, and 6Gf. 85c. for the new account at the end of the month, showing a further fall of a quarter per cent. The rate of interest for advances on rentes is apparently more than 6j per cent. According to the financial advices from Paris the new year seems to have opened heavily. At Hamnburg the rate of discount is again 7 per cent., a Iurther amount of silver bars having been taken from the Bank. The amount of specie to be forwarded by the India and China mail is estimated at 430,0001., almost entirely silver. Although the heaviest shipments are for Bombay and Calcutta, a portion is destined for Hongkong, Shanghai, and Canton. This shipment, although large, is below any of those made by the China mails during the past six months. In the colonial produce-markets this week, owing to the holydays, there has not been much general trade. The chief feature has been the business in tea, of which large quantities chaDged hands on the arrival of the telegraphic news from Trieste reporting the collision at Canton. The extensive transactions entered into in common congou commenced at Is. per lb., and, although this price was not maintained, a good demand has since existed at 11d. I.or lb., at which the market is now firm. The better descriptions have also been disposed of at a considerable advance on last week's rates. The China letters delivered yesterdsy are considered favourable to the rise. There has been a fair inquiry for sugar, and the small sales reported are at rather higher quotations. Coffee also is firm, and a cargo of Rio has been realized afloat at 46s. per cwt. for the Mediterranean. For the conimon descriptions of rice, both afloat and on the spot, there is a good demand at full quotations. At a mecting of the London Dock Company, held to-day, Mr. Cattley in the chair, a dividend of 2i per cent., less income-tax, for the half-year was declared, and the report was adopted. It was stated that, although business has increased, the profits have diminished,-a result catused by augmented competition, reducedcharges, higher prices of materials, and other contingencies; and that, under tbese circumstances, it has been found necessary to deduct the income-tax from the dividend. The anticipation that the new docks would be opened last October had not been realized, but there will now be little further delay. During the last 10 years the company have incurred an outlay for the erection of new works and the payment of the inconme-tax of about 500,0001. The following is an abstract of the report:- " The directors have now to lay before the proprietors a report of the company's proceedings for the half-year ending the 30th of November, IS :- "The number of loaded ships from foreign ports wlich entered the London Docks during the six montbs ending the 30th of November last was 542, measuring 208,254 tons. The number for the corresponding period in 1855 was i504, measuring 181,40-1 tons. "The amount of earnings during the six months ending the 30th of Novenmber, 186, has been 249,4661. 9s. 3d. The ainiouint for the corresponding period in 1855 was 261.6701. Os. Gd. "The amount of expenditure during the six months end. ing the 30th of November last has been 166,5911. 9s. 4d. The amiiount of the like expenditure for the correspondin^ period in 1855 was 162,3421. 2s. 7d. The amount ot expenditure includes the payment of the income-tax. " By the statemenit of the accounts for the half-year it will be seen that the balance standing at the credit of profit and loss is 236,7481. 17s. 4d., out of which the directors reconmiend the payment of a dividend of 2, por cent. on the company's stock for the half-year less the income-tax, amounting to 88,04-51. ls. 4d., which will leave a balance in favour of the company of 148,7031. 16s. " of the balance standing at the credit of profit and loss the sum of 180,5391. 9s. 7d. consists of the amount of outstanding charges due to the company on goods in the warehouses. " The stock of goods in the warehouses on the 30th of November last was 101,0:31 tons. At the same time last yeaqr it was 95.376 tons." The directors reported to the last meetissg that the first stone of the additional entrance at Shadnell had been laid, and they are glad to be able to add that the progress made in the works since that time has been ve-y satisfactory. A report on the Mons Collieries from Mr. B. Dodd, a mineral surveyor privately despatehed from this country to examine them, has been received today by the parties interested. After entering into all the details of the production and working, it describes the total annual profit of the mines now openi to be 34,9261., equal to more than 147 per cent. upon their aggregate value, which is estinnated by Mr. Dodd at 234,4481. With regard to the new concessions granted by the Belgian Government, it is stated that they are favourably situated immediately in the coalfield and close to collieries now in operation. A shareholder in the AtlanticTelegraph Company complains of the directors having made a call of 10 per cent. without giving the previous notice of 21 days required by the Joint-Stock Companies Act of 185G. The notice is dated the 1st inst., and demands payment on or before the 5th. This en-or, unless it can be explained, indicates careless management. The Stock-Exchange Committee met to-day on the question of confirming their recent resolution regas ding the Great Northern Railway Company, and resolved that it should be discharged. From the following letter, however, together with the tenour of their resolution adopted this afteimoon, it will be seen that the Committee of the StockExchange see no reason to doubt the propriety of the course theytook in threatening the company with stringent measures "Committee-room, Stock-Exchange, Dec. 26. " Sir.-I am instructed by the Comnmittee of the SiockExchange to acknowvledge the receipt of your letter and resolutions of the board of the Great Northern Railway Company of the 23d inst. The committee have indubitable evidence that a transfer from the names of Sutton and Frederick Lee, lodged by Mr. Alfred Barnes, was absolutely refused regitration by the officers of the copany ; upon this refusal, the tranlsfer and coupon were requested to be vn bak c by Mr. Barsies's clerk which was also declined. "t n aoter instances transfer were refused registration under circumstances, if possible, still less iustifiable. "In no one of there cases could thern be 'any ground to believe the holder of such stock has been party to any fraud in the manner of obtaining it.' fu"pNeither can the committee recegnize any right of reCreat of registration when the buiyer has given ful value for the stock, en the, faith of the transfer and coupon of the conpan..' and for which certificates of registration have been issu d to the sellers of the stock. "1The resolutionl forwarded to you on the 226 inst., which stands for coiafirsation on the 29th, I amsinstructedtosay the committee hoy,e they willthen be able to discharge ; and for this purpose . am requested to inquire if the Great Northern :Railwiay Company be now prepared to allow transfers to be mnade which are accompanied by coapons which have been issued by the duly authorized officers of the company. "I am, &c,, WSecretary,ay.1 Great Northr RiwyCmany." ",Com itero,SokEcag, Jan. 2. "The commite ben duyifrdtht the Great Northern Railway opn a tlnt regsre certain transfers of Great NotenadEs Licisimr la stocks, the registration of which,acodn to induial evidence received by this co5siiittee was refuised by the t4tck was genuine, and that there was no reason to believe that any forged stock had ever passed through the seller's name ; ' Resolvcd,-That the resolution of the 22d of Decem. ber last, relating to the non-quotation of and non-recogni. tion of bargains in the several stocks or shares of the Great Nortlern Railway Company, he discharged. "By order of the Committee, "' GEORGE WEIBB, Secretary." It is expected that the proposed meetino of bankers and traders to devise a remedy for the insecurity thrown upon all transactions in dock warrants by the recent decision of the Court of Error in the case of " Kinsford v. Merry " will take place at the London Taverni on WVednesday the 14th inst., wthen Baron Rothschild, as one of the members for London, will preside. Meanwhile the foUowing further communication has been received oln the subject:- I Sir, -The powerful impulsealready felt by your recognilion of the important interests which bear on the case of 'Kingsford v. Merry,' and our observations on this subject having been favoured by a place in your columns on the 31st ult., we are induced to pursue the question, in the hope that it may be agitated to a hticessful issue by the combined a.tion of the bankers, merchants, and brokers of this metrop lis, whose interests are so seriously involved, and whose energies, we trust, are being aroused by the exigency of the occasion. " The decision lately pronounced in the above case (the particulars of which, with its oppressive details, have been atuply conmmented upon) is universally regarded as contrary to justice and common sense; and, being in opposition to the previous verdict of four of our ablest judges, a2fords another instance of the proverbial uncertainty of the law. The conisideration of the subject, therefore, we think, simDly resolves itself into the question-should not an act of Par. lianmient be introduced that shall establish and confirm a rule of trade which has been recognized and acted on for many years, which has, up to this period, worked smoothly and efficiently, and the abrogation of wvhich by the recent decision lias excited feelings of anxieby and alarm,-in short, a rule which recognizes a warrant for goods as the indisputable representative of the goods themselves, and its hiolder as their actual possessor ? " I T'he law as it now stands, we fear, offers a screen for the knave alid a trap for the honest trader; and, unless altered, will doubtless furnish more cases for the consideration of the Court of Error. We remain, Sir, your most obedient servants, " L. COWAN ANl) SONS. "London, Jan. 2."

RAILWAY INTELLIGEHCX. RATTWAV 'TPRhWrr The tratffic returns of railways in the United kingdom published for the week ending Dec 27 amounted to 430,772L, and for the corresponding week of 1855 to 395,2901, showing an increme of 35,4821. The groms receipts of the eight railways having thoir termini in the metrepolis amounted for the week ending as above to 190,7381., and for the corresponiding week of last yea- to 172,86tL, shoving au increase of 18,877C The increase on the Eastern Counties Railway amounted to 3,3371.; on the Great Northern, to 507& ; on the Great Western to 5,474L ; on the London and North-Western to 4,7261.; on the London and BlackwalU, to 691.; on the London, Brighton and South Coast to 1,6781.; on the London and South. Western to 2,51.; and on the South-Eastern to 5731.; total, 18,877l The receipts on the other lines in the united kingdom amounted to 240,0341., and for the corresponding period of 185 to 222,428L, showing an increase of 17,6061. in the receipts of those lines, which, added to the increase on the metropolitan lines, makes the total increase 35,482. as compared with the corresponding weekc of 185.. From published and estimated returns of railways in the united kingdom for the year 1856 it appears that the traffic receipts amounted, on 8,760 miles of railway, to 22,995,500., and for the year 1855 to 2,123,315t. on 8,240 miles, showing an increare of 1,872,1851., or 8S86 per cent, in the receipts, and of 521 miles, or 6-32 per cent, in the mileage. The cost of constracting the lines, and providing working stock of companies who publish their traffic retums, anmounted in August last to 292,346,2601., and of the lines belonging to companies who did not publish their traffic, either weekly or monthly, about 6,600,0001.-making together 298,946,2601. expended on 8,760 miles of railway, being at the rate of 34,782L per mile. The annual increase of railway traffic has been very considerable. The increase in the published traffic receipts in the year 1843 over that of the preceding year amounted to 500,8741.; in the year 1844, to 7G6,7331;; in 1845, to 1,058,3421.; in 1846, to 1,020,6501.; in 1847, to 1,285,7971. ; in 1848, to 1,109,3351; ; in 1849, to 980,8081;. in 1850, to 1,744,1611. ; in 1851 (Great Exhibition), to 1,809,9231.; in 1852, to 520,402. ; in 1853, to 2,040,2201. in 1854, to 2,079,9951.; in 1855, to 1,122,7907.; and in 1856, to 1,872,1851. Of the latter amount, 13,3141. was due to the increase on the Bristol and Exeter Railway; 23,0801. on the Chester and Holyhead; 16,9141. on the Dublin and Wicklow; 49,668L on the Eastern Counties; 34,1841. on the East Lancashire; 57,6141. on the Great Northern; 16,1311. on the Great Southern and Western; 116,5997 on the Great Western; 37,801L on the Shrewsbury lines; 116,806t. on the Lancashire and Yorkshire and Southport line; 7,290t. on the Lancaster and Carlisle; 131,2121. on the London and North-Western; 5S,591. on the London, Brighton, and South Coast; 85,9291. on the T ondon and Sonth-Western ; 15,500L on the London and Tilbury; 20,5181. on the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire; 93,4821. on the Midland; 25,4491. on the Mlidland Great Westem; 6,5121. on the Newcastle and Carlisle; 14,7001. on the Newport, Abergavenny, and Hereford; 51,4541. ontheNorth-Eastem; 9,3571. on theNorth London; 44,8181. on the North Staffordshire; 10,9331. on the South Devon; 49,3571. on the South Wales; 32,8741. on the Taff Vale; 15,3321. on the Vale of Neath; and 19,7621 on the West Hartlepool-making, together, 1,176,4901. The average traffic receipts per mile per annum of railways in the united kdngdom were as foUows :-For 1842, 3,1181.; for 1843, 3,0851.; for 1844, 3,278t.; for 1845, 3,4691.; for 1846, 3,305t.; for 1847, 2,8701.; for 148, 2,5561t; for 1849. 2,3021.; for 1850, 2,2271.; for 1851 2,2831.; for 1852, 2,2831. ; for 1853, 2,4711.; for 1854, 2,6041.; for 1855, 2,6681.; and for 1856, 2,7591., showing a gradual increase from 1850 in the receipts per mile. With regard to the average cost per mile it was 34,6901. in 1842 and in 1856 at the rate of 34,7821., being about the same. The expenditure of capital on the railways publishing their traffic returns had increased from 52,380,1001 in 1842 to 292,346,2601. in 1856, showing that, notwithstanding the construction of numerous cheap lines, the average expenditure per mile has not been reduced. The aggregate amount of traffic on railways in 1842 on 1,730 miles was 4,341,781L., and in 1856, on 8,404 miles, 22,4'3,5001,j showing an increase in 14 years of 18,151,719L, or at the rate of 1,289,0001. per annum. It is gratifying to perceive that there is every prospect of a continued increase in railway traffic and that in the couse of five years hence the receipts wvil amount to 30,000,0001. for the year. Should the old system of dealing with capital be persevered in, the increae in the preference charges will probably overtake all the advantages of increased traffic and of expected decreased expenditure in working, but if that system should be abandoned, and a prudentncourse adopted, it may be fairly expected that railway property wil pay in the course of five years on the average5 per cent, on the whole of the capital expended on the railways, instead of, as at present, only about 3l per cent. The following are the receipts of railways for the past I week:- BLYTH A2ND TYNE A special meeting of tho sbareholders of this company has bee, held xt Newcastle this week, Alderman Carr in the chair when it was resolved to proceed with the bill for relqncjuts the Longhurst extension, and to snbstitute a lranc to Vlrkworth-harbour in lieu thereof; and to construct a branch from the min line near Nlewsham to the Blyth harbour and docks, to hase land for worksho and improvements, an~ to obsncontributions from the lessees of the Brunton and Shiedda and Brlcworth Railwasys.

zXPEARrmNTS rAX GuAv2tWEY. TO THE EDITOR OF TaE TI!ES. Sir,-In the latter part of 1854 I submittedto the Dcke of Newcastle, then Minister at War, a proposal for a gun which I anticipLtod would possess great superiority over ths common forms of light artilery and I undertook-, with hb Grace's authority, to construct a field-piece inconformity with the plan I had suggested. The gan was acordingly soon afterwards made, and has sinoe, during a period of nearly two years, beea the subject of numerous cxperiments, partly upon the Ordnance firing-ground at Shoeburyno3g. but principally under my own direction in this neighbour. hood. I have hitherto avoided publicity in reference to these ex. periments, but, as matured results of much interest and importance have now been arrived at, and as other names are already before the public in connexion with gun experi. ments made during the same period, I feel that I may now, without impropriety, give some information on the aubject. With a view to strength and durability, the gun is composed internally of steel and externaUy of wrought-iron, applied in A twisted or spiral form as in a musket or fowlingpiece. The bore is nearly two inches in diameter and is rifled. The projectile is a pointed cylinder 6i inches long, and its weight is 51b. It is made of cast-iron, coated with lead, and is fired from the gun with a charge of 10 ounces of powder; it contains a smal cavity in the centre, and may be used either as a shot or a shell. When applied asa shell the cavity is filled with powder, and a detonating fuze is inserted in front, so as to fire the powder in the centre on striking an object. When used as a shot the powder is omitted, and an iron point, which favours penetration, is substituted for the fuse. The gun is constructed to load at the breoch, the object being not only to obviate the disadvantages of sponging and loading from the front, but also to allow the projectile to be larger in diameter than would enter at the mutzle, and thus to insure its tak-ing the impress of the grooves and completely flling the bore. The pieca weighs 5 cwt., and is mounted upon a carriage which bean a general resemblance to that of an ordinary 6-pounder field gun, but which embraces a pivot frame and recoil slide. A se-ew is also applied, not only for elevating and depressing the gun, but also for moving it horizontaUy, by which means great delicacy of aim is effected. The recoi Slide has an upward inclination, which enables the gun after running back to recover its position by gravity, and its use is to relieve the pivot-frame and adjusting screws from injurious concussion. I shall now give some particulars of the experiments recently made with this gun on tho coast of Northumberland, near the villago of Whitley, under the official inspection of Colonel Wilmot. Fourteen shots were in the first instance fired from a distance of 1,500 yards at a timber butt, 5ft. wide and 7&ft. high. Six of those were expended in finding the elevation proper for the distance, bat after that ras determined every succeeding shot hit the object without previous graze. The final elevation of the gun was 4 deg. 26 min., and the mean lateral distance of the shot marks from a vertical line through the centro of the butt was only 11 Ii Persons who are conversant with artillery practice will be able to appreciate the accuracy of this firing, but for the information of those who are unacquainted with the sabject I may state that the ordinary6-pounder field-piece, which in point of weight forms the nearest approach to the present gun, is perfectly useless at a distance of 1,500 yards, and is very uncertain even at 1,000 yards. It is only, therefore, with heavy artilery that a comparison can be drawn, and it wiU be sufficient to state that in tabalating the practice made with such ordnance the defiections are invariablyrecordod in yards, whereas with this rifled gun they can only be properly given in inches. With respect to penetration, the following particulars will be regarded as equally remarkable, considering the small weight of the shot and the length of the range. The butt was 3 ft. thicr, and was composed of six layers of rock elm bolted together, so as to form a solid block. One shot passed entirely through; another struck near the edge and glanced; and the remaining six penetratod within a few inches of the opposite side. Shell firing was next tried at a distance of 1,500 yards, the gun being fired at tho same elevation and with the same charge as in the previous practice at the butt. In this case two targets were erectod, one behind the other, so as to appear as one object when viewed from the gun, and a space of 30 foet was left between them. The front target was intended to exhibit the perforations of the sheUs before bursting, and the back ono to show the effoot of the fragments resulting from explosion. After somo prelininary experiments 22 shoUs were fired at the front target, and of theso only one missod the object of aim. The following are the particulars :-17 hit the first target direct, and burst behind it, the fragmonts penetrating the second one; throe grazed and burst immediatoly in front of the first target, and perforatod both with the piece;; one hit the bottom of the first target and exploded in the ground, and tho remaining one missed entirely and burst on some rocks nearly in line beyond. A strong side wind was blowing at the time, and accounted for the devia. tion of this single shell. Four shels and three shot were then fired at an elevation of 6 degrees, from a distance of 2,000, or, more accurately, 1,964 yards. All these struck within tho broadth of the target; but the elevation being scarcely snfficient they aU fell a lttle short, except one shell, which, ranging somewhat further than the others, hit the target and burst as usual. The results of this shell firing wero as follows :-Tho front target oontained 51 holes, and the back ono 164, wvhile the ground between and adjacent to tho targets exhibited about 70 perforations by fragments of shells, tho greater portion of which were afterwards recovered by digging. With respect to ranges exceeding 2,000 yards I may state that on previous occasions the gun had been tried up to 3,000 yarcs,-a distance which was reached with an elovation of ll deg., and the usual charge of 10 ounoes of powder or 1-5th the wcight of the projectile. By augmenting the charge the range is increased, but the acouracy is impairod, and I thereforo adhere to the 10-ounce ch&rge, which give3 ample ponetration, as the experiments at the butt will testify. I may also observe that the ranges obtained with this charge bear a favourable comparison with those of tho beaviest round shot guns fired with a much larger propDrtion of powder. I It is a curious fact, and one which groatly increases the efficiency of the shells, that owing to tho bursting chargo requiring a minute space of time to maturo its ignition after the firing of the fuse by impact, the shell is enablod to travel four or five feet after strikng an object before disruption takes plae. Hence, therefore, it scts as a shot before it bursts as a shell. When it perforates a target tho explosion may be scen to talke plcoe a few foet beyond, and when it grazes it has time to rise, and may he observed to burst after clearing tho ground. If, therofore, it were firod against a ship, it would first penetrato tho side in its entirety, and then, bursting, traverse the dock in fragments; or if directed against troops, it would piereo tho front line as a bullet, and operate like grape shot beyond. Tho shells explodo with equal certainty whether the first substance struck be hard or soft, and, in fact, they even burst on the surface of water, provided the elevation of the gun be not too great. The bursting charge is very small, but it suffloes to break the shell into about 30 pieecs which pursue their forward course without too much dispersion. It is impossible to contomplate the results obtained with this gun without being impressed with the important part it is calculated to perform in warfare. Opjx,sod to any ordinary field piece, it would be like the Mini rifle aginst the old musket, and no gun could be worked at an embrazure if a fire of shells were directod against it by one of tbese rifled pieces placod within the distance of a mile. In naval operations, alo, guns of this description, but of larger sire, might apparently be appliod with great effoetnmore especially as a systom of breoeh loading, combined with a self-recovering recoil action, would be poeculiarly adrva4 tageous in firing from portholes. Even light b-pounders sending their shells from grat distances through the sides of a ship and sweeping the decks with fragments of lead and iron would produoe very destructive effects, and a smal awift stoamer earing a few snch guns might prove a wery troublesome opponent to a large ship of war. But if the dimensions of the gun were incroaead so as to adapt it for shells of 2D1b. or 301b, still more terrible injury could bo inflicted at greater distances, and the ponderous artillery now used at sea would be of little sernie when opposed to the accurate and long-range firing of such rifled shell guns. It now only remains to be stated that in the eourse of the long series of experiments made with this gun it has been fired nearly 1,300 times without sustaining any permanent injury either in the breoeh loading arrangement or otberwise. The only parts exposed to wear (and none are seriously so) are separable from the gun, uid can with great facility be renewod. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. W. G.

LONDO2, SATURDAY, JANUARY 3, 1857. We have found the philosopher's stone, not in Australia, not in California, not amid the silver of Potosi, not in the diamond mines of Golconda, not in the crucible of the alchemist, not in an inconvertible paper currency, but in the simple re.-. justment of the principles of taxation according 10o lans suggested by nature and reafflrmed by science as embodying truth as once of abstract simplicity and purity and of perfectly practical application, To leave industry untrammeled, to strike from her limbs the fetters of a false and artificial aystem, to use the Custom-house merely as a means of obtaining revenue, and renounce the foolish attempt to regulate by law the exigencies of commerce,-these things have been to us a fountain of abundance, an inexbaustible cornucopia, a talisman of ever-renewed wealth and power. The prosperity that could not be won by restrictions came at once unsolicited as soon an the restrictions were taken off, and so long as we have the wisdom to keep our currency on a sound metalic basis and to practise reasonable economy there seems no reason to fear the close of this golden age. Not only has free trade been an incalculable blessing to us; it ought to be, if rightly understood, a no less instructive warning to our neighbours. They see what we have been able to effect, and they have only to will it in order to effect a similar change. To raise a large revenue with less trouble than we formerly did a small one, combining an increase of our income with a lightening of our burdens, is a feat so extraordinary that we have a right to accuse of wilful obliquity those who will not follow in a direction which theory and practice alike unite to recommend. Of course, such reflections as these are set down to that inherent desire which Englislunen are supposed to entertain of flooding foreign countries with the products of their industry, and turning against them that balance of trade the mysterious oscillations of which are the traditional terror of the old school of political economists. We cannot convince people who will listen neither to theory nor practice, and so we must content ourselves with noting their selfimposed losses, hoping against hope that some cause may dispel the darkness which has settled down on a question to us in its present form so clear and comprebensible. Take, for example, the United States of America, whose boast it is to "whip all creation," especially in matters of statecraft, and to be more particularly transcendent on everything that relates to the acquisition, retention, and multiplication of dollars, however made and by whatever medium represented. Yet our experience is lost upon them, as though it had never been, and they are groping about to find the path which lies only too directly before their faces. The Democratic party, having gained the victory at the last election, has determined to show that it is good for other and better things than the maintenance of slavery, and an effort is to be made in Congress to rescue American manufacturers from the load under which they groan. It is the old story of protection; everybody is protected, but then everybody loses more by buying protected goods and materials than he gains by selling them. The manufacturer sells his cottons or his woollens at a price enhanced by an import duty of 30 per cent., but then, in order to attain this advantage, he is compelled to live in an atmosphere of 30 per cent. His raw materials, his machinery, the clothes that he wears, and the wine that he drinks, are all purchased at a price equally unnatural, and he gains at the cost of exclusion from foreign markets a very doubtful and precarious position in his own. The article of wool furnishes an excellent illustration of the manner in which the system works. There is a duty of 30 per cent. on wool, and the same on woollen cloths and fabrics of every description. There is no country in the world where people want warm clothing and good blankets more than in America; they are necessities of life, and the purchasing power of so opulent and thriving a community is prodigious. How great, then, must be the prosperity of the growers of wool and the manufacturers of woollen fabrics in the American Union ! The present growth of wool in the United States is about 47,500,0001b., 5,000,0001b. less than in 1850, and about the same amount more than in 1837. Considering the number of States and territories that have been occupied during the last 20 years-a period in which the population of the Union has nearly doubled-we must regard such a result as paltry in the extreme. But, though the protective duty on wool has worked so ill for the grower, it has surely benefited the equally protected manufacturer ? So far is this from being the case that the machinery for worldng up the fabric has by no means kept pace even wiith the trivial increase of the fabric itself. In 1837 there were in the United States 344 carding machines, using 8,250,0001b. of wool, or one-fifth of the quantity then produced. Now there are but 30 carding machines at work, and, except a few contracts for the army and navy, which Protectiollist patriotism gives for the encouragement of a manufacture which cannot live by a duty of 30 per cent., there are hardly any woollen manufactures at all. The truth is people cannot bring their mutton from Europa ; therefore they must have sheep and to these sheep wool is an unavoidable appendage; but there is no similar necessity with regard to woollen cloth, and therefore, though wool is produced, woollen cloth is not. One cannot wonder that an effort should be made to shake off this state of things ; but we are informed that it is made with the poorest prospect of success. The fear of the untaxed foreigner is upon the woolly interest, and the necessity of clinging to the 30 per cent. that has ruined them will be strenuously urged by manufacturers and woolgrowers, and enforced with arguments drawn from its very inadequacy. " If," it will be said, " all this pro" tection cannot shield us from the foreigner, how " are we to exist without it I" We answer, "Try, "and perhaps you will find that the very things "you relied on for success have been the cause of "your failure." To protect everybody is to injure everybody, and to benefit nobody. To protect nobody is to enrich every one; but the wool interest of America will not hear the truth, and obstinately refuses what is for its own advantage, because it comes disguised in the form of a benefit to the consumer and the public.There cannot be a more insignificant question in itself than that of this or that particular officer's reward and decoration. The individual is nothing ; at least, it cannot be expected that, whether he has been treated wel or ill, the world can occupy itself much with his case. The world has so much to do, there is so much necessary business to be done, that there is no time for mere sentiment; and therefore, if this or that man is disappointed, so far as the individual himself is concerned, we are hardhearted enough to say that we have nothing to tel him but that he must bear it. But, though the individual's grievance is a petty matter altogether, it may happen that the individual may represent a principle, and in that case the public is interested in the affair. The object of the whole system of military rewards is the efficiency of the service, and for that end it is necessary that there sholuld be fairness in the distribution of these rewards, that there should be no favouritism as regards individuals, and no ilHiberality and prejudice with regard to classes of services, but that all kinds of services should be rewarded and none left out. Lord PA.fTxuRE has now declared publicly and most emphaticaly his approval of the Report of Sir JoiN ArNLiL and Colonel TuLLocH. He nays, in his speech at Arbroath,-" I have not had any opportunity of recording in public the appro"bation of the Government of the Report of those "two gentlemen. The information in that Report "was accumulated under many difficulties, made "with great fidelity, and, made not with the inten"tion of injuring the feelings of any British officer, "but of telling the truth." The essential service performed in the preparation of that Report being thus acknowledged, and the nature of the service also being acknowledged,-that it was a dificult service, and that though it was a difficult service it was well done,-this acknowledgment being publicly and formally made by the Government to the country and expressed through its constitutioral organ, the Minister of War, it does appear to us to require xome explanation why everybody else connected with the war in the Crimea has been rewarded, and Sir JoHiN M' u.ML and Colonel TIJLxoca alone left out. Lord LtrcAN has received the Colonelcy of the 8th Hussars; Lord CARDIoAx is Inspector-General of Cavalry; Sir RicHAP.D AIREY is Quartermaster-General; and Colonel GORtDON is Deputy-Quartermnaster-GeneraL Had the services of these officers been undisputed; it would still be a question requiring an answer why their services had been rewarded and another most important service disregarded. But the contrast is considerably magnified when we bave to consider that the services rendered by these officers have been strongly disputed, indeed, that the officers themselves have been proved by the clearest evidence guilty of the greatest negligence and blundering; whereas the services of Sir JoHN NrIxNErL and Colonel TuLLOCH are not questioned, except by those whose unfavourable interest in the Report makes them partial witnesses. And the contrast is heightenedstill more, andlighted up as by the introduction of a powerful reflector, when we have to consider further that the officers rewarded are the very persons whose negligence and blundering the unrewarded officers exposed, and did this signal service in exposing; so that we have the spectacle of the delinquents being selected for honour, and the judges who performed the national service of condemning them singled out for neglect. Here are condemned men receiving high promotion, and decorated and bestarred in a way that would have rewarded the nost able veterans of the Peninsula, while the two men before whose tribunai they stood, and by whose impartial decision they were weighed and found wanting, are passed over in cold silence. A Commission of Inquiry is doubtless not a popular military service; it has not the brilliancy of a service on the field, it does not appeal to the romantic or poetical element in us, but it is still a solid practical service. it is one of those tliings that must be done, and, if it must be done, you must have able men and men of high character to do it, and ability and high character, r;here they are made use of for the public good, deserve their reward. The very unpopularity of the servico rather adds to than detracts from its value, and makes it so much the more important, as a matter of public interest, that it should not miss its share of public honour. It is no pleasant thing for military men to sit in judgment over officers, and those of high rank. It is an invidious office at the best, and imapartiality in it subjects them to certain complaint and ill-feeling. Of course, those who are exposed think themselves ill-treated, and say so; while those who have nothing to do with it simply hold their tongues, and do not gratuitously verify a judgment which gives individual officers pain. Commissioners of Inquiry are thus certain to create enemies, -while it is very unlikely that they will make any friends. The service, therefore, is so muchthe more painful, and therefore so much the more deserving. And mark the danger to the public interest if, while all other classes of services are carefully rewarded, the judicial service is passed over. Whom wiU you get to undertake your Commissions of Inquiry if you single out that particular kind of service for marked neglect,-if you invite honest and able men to undertake this task, admit its difficulty, acknowledge that they have done it well, and then refuse to notice them ? The neglect of individual merit thus recoils eventually upon the service and upon the public at large, wlhen it is discovered, too late, that the damper has told, and that nobody will accept an office which is absolutely necessary from time to time for the public good. When Sir J. WNEILL and Colonel TuLmocU were invited to undertake this task they hesitated, and would willingly have been excused, but they were imnediately told that it was their duty to undertake it, that it was not the part of a loyal and faithful member of the public service to stand by and wait tiUl he had a pleasant duty offered him, but to undertake that for which he was fit, and which the exigencies of the service imposed upon him. Had the two Commissioners persisted in declining the task because it was not one pleasant to their feelings, and was not one to make them popular with the service, what kind of answer would have been made them ? The mind of the Great DuKcE has left a sufficient stamp upon our army to insure one reply, and one only, to such an effeminate plea. But if men are appealed to by the argument of duty they ought not to be left altogether in the lurch when they have acted upon it. Can any one look into the details of the camp in the Crimea and say that the more sober and solid military virtues were too common among our officers ? It is not brilliancy in the field only which makes a good officer; obedience, the wish to be useful, interest in the public good, is as essential a part of his character as courage. But the sober class of military virtues is not encouraged by decorating systematic dissensions in the persons of Lords Lucx and CARDIGAN, the most wasteful blundering on the part of Sir R. AiIuiY and Colonel GORDoN, and passing over judicial ability and usefulness in the persons of Sir Joux MXzEILL and Colonel TULLOCH.
This is a strange war which is now imminent between the Swiss Cantons and the Prussian KING. As the world has heard of the " War of the "Spanish Succession," and of the " Revolutionary W'ar" with France, so this one-if ever it is waged-will be knowln to posterity as the" W ar " of Etiquette." On the one hand the Cantons are willing to liberate thoir prisoners; on the other, the King of PRP'SSIA is perfectly willing to acquiesce in the disruption of the anomalous link which binds the fortunes of his house to those of the little Swiss Canton; but who is to speak first ? This is the point on which thousands of human beings now susceptible of beef and pudding are shortly to bite the gritty and unsavoury dust. The masters of the ceremonies will not intervene until a copious chorus of widows and orphans and mutilated men implores their intervention. The Prussian monarch admits that he is willing to waive his rights if the preliminary condition be fulfilled of the unconditional liberation of the prisoners; then why not formally say so, and these worthy gentlemen would at once be set at large? The strength of the Swiss case, independently of its abstract justice, lies in this-that they cannot be expected to have much confidence in the intentions of a monarch who, professing to aim at reciprocal concessions, declines in any way to bind himself. On the other hand, the King of PRusssL. or his agents would scarcely, in the face of Europe, maintain so wild an absurdity as would be contained in the assertion, that if Prussia meets the Swiss Cantons half way there is reason to suppose that the Swiss will not faithfully fulfil their portion of the agreement. A simple intimation from the Court of Berlin that, the Neuchatel prisoners once liberated, there would be an end of Prussian claims on the little Canton, would, s & matter of course, procure their instant freedom; but the intimation cannot, it seems, be given in any official form without the unconditional liberation of the prisoners. The Prussian monarch, who so lately shrank from any part in the Battle of the Giants, becomes a very BoBADsI where the Pigmies are concerned. HIe may chance, however, to find the Swiss more stubborm opponents than his army encountered in the ignoble struggles of '48 and '49, for in their mountains a few lessons have been read to monarchs who had over-confidently advanced to what they supposed to be an easy victory, which the irritated KiN-o would do weR not to lose sight of even in the height of his indignation. |Our object to-day, however, is rather to call attention to the patriotic declaration which | has been issued by the Committee of the Wur- temberg Chambers against the passage of the Prussiau troops through their territory than to deal with the general argument. Here, at last, we see in Germany derpotic government and representative government face to face. The King of PFnussx, who represents the principle of despotism, is about to make an attack upon the hberties of a free people. For a point of punctilio and for the selfish gratification of his dynastic pride he is about to inflict the miseries of war upon the people whom PRovxDvz-CE has submitted to his rule. The Wurtemberg Deputies, on the other hand, speaking in the name of the population whose interests they represent, deprecate the passage of Prussian troops through their territory. Without entering at all into the question of right between the Prussian King and the Swiss Cantons, they point out tiat the war per se will be an evil of incalculable magnitude to the people of Wurtemberg. The Swiss are their neighbours and their customers. There is a thriving trade between Wurtemberg and the Cantons, which will certainly be destroyed by the operations of the war. The Cantons, in any case, mnst be impoverished, and thousands of Swiss will be butchered and shot down wvhose energies would have been far more profitably devoted to the production of equivalents for the produce and manufactures of Wurtemberg. Besides this, the mere passage of a foreign arny through their country will be a serious evil. Trade and agriculture will be disturbed within their boundaries-and for what reason ? Simply to assist the King of PrussiA in carrying out his designs against the Cantons, and in vindicating his alleged rights against a confederation of free States, which have never inflicted the slightest injury upon the people or even upon the Court of Wurtemberg. There can be no doubt that it would be in the highest degree for the interest of Wurtemberg that this war should not take place at all. Why, then, should that Power promote it? Why should not Wurternberg throw every possible obstacle in the way of hostilities which must prove highly detrimental to her own interests in every sense ? The King of WVrR_ TEMnRERG Will shortly prove in his own person what the value of constitutional sovereignty may be as the principle is understood in Germany. Will he yield to dynastic influences ? Will he prefer the interests of his own people to the prejudices of his caste and the traditions of his throne? What umbrage have the Swiss Cantons ever given to the Court of Stuttgard that it should tamely acquiesce in letting loose upon them the horrors of war? We would entreat the attention of the KiXo and of his M1inisters to the enormous accession of strength which has recently accrued to the little kingdom of Sardinia in consequence of the spirited attitude which Vicron E:z.usxrEL and his Ministers assumed during the recent war with Russia. They actively engaged in the war for the maintenance of a just principle, and the public opinion of Europe has richly rewarded the manly policy of this little State. It is not now asked of the King of WVuRTFMBIERG. to throw himself into the thick of the fight, but simply to assert the independence of his throne. Let him but stand neuter, and refuse to assist either of the belligerents in any way, and Europe will not be ungrateful for the decision. What has he to do with the jealousies and animosities of the Prussian Sovereign, that he should sacrifice the welfare of his people in such a cause ? If it should unhappily turn out that the King of VURTE3BERO, forgetful of the duties he owes to his own people, acquiesces in the views of the Prussian Cabinet, Europe may then contrast the subserviency of a Sovereign with the independence and patriotism of the representatives of a people. If the Kumw should be so ill-advised as to turn a deaf ear to the remonstrances of the Deputies,-:i, by a slavish and courtly policy, he proves that the welfare of his people is, in his opinion, not to be weighed in the balance against the dynastic sympathies which bind regal races together, the conclusion is inevitable that throughout the Rhine region at least the popular principle will ultimately prevail. The Germant bIurgeosie have ever been a timid race in political action; but here at least is evidence that in one section of that vast territory they have the di.scretion to appreciate and the spirit to maintain their rights. Had there been a spark of such intelligence in the Frankfort Assembly six or seven years ago the King of PRUSSIA Would certainly not at the present moment have been meditating war against the Swiss Cantons for the gratification of his own personal pique. The experinent, however, failed, as it deserved to fail, because rational liberty is not to be attained by wild words and improvident acts. The case is widelv different in Wurtemberg at the present moment. It is not fair, of course, to anticipate the action of the King of WVRTEtMnERt; before he openly announces his resolution; but, at the same time, it is to be presunied that the remonstrance would not have been presented had it not been known that such a step was needed.

It may be added tbat the Melbourme pipers to hand were brought to Ceylon by the Marion-a ship rhich has on several occasions made herself faimos by the rapidity of her voyanes, and is owned by the present Mayor of Liverpool, Mr. Francis Shand. The news to hand is 10 days later than that receirod by the Red Jacket. From Sydney, H-bhrt Town, Adelaide, and Launceston our dates are to the 4th of October, from New 7 land to the 3d of September, and from Western Australia to the 9th of July.

The statement of the revenue of the colony for the year and the quarter ending on the 30th of September has been published. The periods embraced ;a this statement are com. pared with the corresponding penods of the year ending on the 30th of September, 1i8;, and the result is on the whole satisfactory. There isa net increase in the general revenues of 250,5111U on the year, Ind of 110,901. on the quarter. The principal items of increase on the year are-Customs, 521,6701.; licenses, 4,15a.; of decrease,-goldfields revenue, 165,5251.; port and harbour dues, 24,7131.; postage, 26,3V.; assessment on stock, 11,95; fines ad forfeitures, 7,9371.; fees of court, 6,9264; land sales, 32,1801.; miscellaneous, 5,6S21. The increase in the Customs'revenne is verymarked, and, wben the stationary position of our population as regard5 numbers during the period is considerod, this muit be taken as very telling evidence of general prosperity-that is of the ability of the colonists to purchase articles of luxury. The increase of the export-duty on gold must he set off against the decrease in the re. venue from the gold-fields, brought about by the abo lition of the license system, which was in operation at the commencement of the first period refenred to. The de-. crease in the Post-office my be traced almost entirely to the check which an inadequate and uncertain service has imparted to the writing powers of the poplahtion, and to the falling off in immigration. The port and harbour dues, although exhibiting a decrease on the year, have yielded an increase on the quarter, and are rapidly improving in amount. The falling off in the assessment on stock is matter for inquiry. The other items, of decrcase are of little importance. GOVERNMENT GOLD ESCORT.i.

FAT,LL OCCTRP.ENCE AT EDIN-BURC,.-On NoW Yeax's mornig a lad named Waterston, of respectable circumstances, and employed as a shopman, was apprehended for stabbing four Irish labourers, ono of whom, being wounded in the heart, had immediately expired. The most credible and consistent version of the story is the prisoner's,-namely, tbat on returning home from a party between 2 and 3 o'clock, he was sarsulted near the Free Church College by a party of labourers, wbo wanted money from him toget whiskyto keep Nei Year's-day; that on his refusal they knocked him down, and grasped him by the throat; and that in self-defence he took out a clspknife, and struck about him on *l1 sides, when, his assailants retreat ng, he made his oscape. e immediately cominunicated the circumstance to some friends and to one of the niRht police, and the labourers also gave informstion at the police-office that one of their number, namedJohnChris is was lying on the ground stabbed. The dend body of the litter was shortly afterrards brought in, the wound having been fatal. Waterston was immediately appre. hended and brought to the police-office, where he ErLt learned that one of his assallants had been inurdered b him. Re then muade the statement aboro related, aul emed much dismayed at the fatal result. His statement is corroborated by almoet every circumstance but personal evidence. He bad no oompamon with him to witness the c=nstances, while the testimocny of the labourers is confused and contradictory, and they are unable distinctly to identify him.

' I have no pretension to interFero in any manner whatever in that matter; and I ehould not have said a word to him on the subject if I had thought that I should in any way be quoted by him. "It was not unnatural that I should wish to know whiat vas doing at Southampton, and I thought Mr. Lankester could tell me. " No doubt in the short conversation which ensued I expro.csed my opinion as to the eligibilty of the several candi- tes; and every man in the county who has conversed with an acquaintaTce on the subject has probably done the same, whatever his opinions may be. " Iave gre t respect and regard for you. I think tho talent and abtlity you have displayed and the high position which, by your untiring energy, you Lbas- made for yourself in Southampton, do you very great honour; but I must frankly say, in answer to your appeal, that I do not think you are so well calculated as Mtr. Wcguelin iS to ropresent Southampton in the House of C(ommons. "'Your business avocations lying in Southampton would irterfere with your attendance in Parliament, unless at a great sacrifice -of your private interests; and your habits of thought, as connected with the nature of your commercial pursuits, cannot tend so mnch as those of Mtr. Weguelin to prepare a member for the consideration and discossion of many of the matters which must, from time to time, bo dealt with by Parltament. " Therefore, believing from what I have heard thatiftwo candidates stand upon the Liberal interest, and thus divide the Liberal party, the Conservative party will be Lblo to ve a majority to their candidate- and thinking ir. V~~egelin the best of the two Libcrsi can4i:lates, I cannot but regrot that you should, by diriding the Liberal party, endanger the Liberal cause at Southamp~ton. This is my personal and private opinion, foundod, howevevr, upon pubUic grounds. I do no I consider that it involves any d*isparagement to you I never should have thought of making it known -with a view to influence the decson of the electors of Southampton, and I should not have stated it to you if it had not been for your letter of the 24th " My dear Sir, yours very faithfully ,, ~~~~" P&LL:PRSTON, "Richard Andrews, Esq" "Southampton, Dec. 29, 1856.

HiU autobiography is loft unsinisbed. It is hingular thlt during his last illness he expressed a wish that he might live till Now Year's-day, in order that he might be enablod to eomelete that work. Mr. Britton was born on the 7th of July, 1771, at Kington StMlichael, in Wiltshire, were his fathor once enjoyed a fair share of patronage as bsaker, maltster, shopkeeper, and small farmer, bat he sank into poverty, and John Britton had not much of a school education. In his autobiography Mr. Britton says of his birthplaoe, " the inhabitants were undisciplined, illiterate, and deprived of all good example ;" and agmin he observea, " I do not think there wms , paper or magazine purchased by one of the inhabitants beore the year 1780, when the London riots woro talked about, and 'wondered at." On the 2'5th of October, 17S7, ho quitted the home of his childhood, and accompanied an uncle to seek bis fortune in the great metropolis. He was tben arprenticed as ccllarman to Mr. Mendhaan, of the Jerusalem Tavern, Clrkenwell-green, wbere he was initiatod into the mysteries of "*forcing or fining wines bottling, corking, and binning the sanme." He was wont to steal as much time as he could to vsit old bookataUs and mxke small purchases; but, we are told, " All the reading I could indulge in during my term of legal slavery was by candiblight, in the cellar, and at occasional intervals only, not of Insure, but of time abstracted from systenatic dutjes," In obscure lodgings, at Is. 6d. 6 er week, he stil iWf:ed itx study, and often read in bed during the winter evening. being unable to afford a fire. When in his 22d year. an wi a purse containing about 6t., he walked home to Wiltshire, and found his native village much altered-Mi& motber had died broken-hearted, his fatbhr had become idiotic, and was no longer in the r.nd of the living, and his brothers and sisters were cattered abroad. Bis old homo being thus destroyed, after hxving endeavoured in vain to> procu,re employment in the west of En1and. he returned to LondOn altDost penniless, shoeless and shirtle.

1THIB TRADE OF 3856. The following reports on the commercial operattions of the past year are from the annual circulars of houses connected with the various branches of the trade of the uited kingdom. They are of a Taried character, consequent upon the fluctuations resul]ting from the change from peace to war, but -they all confirm the accounts hitherto aviven of the 'extraordinary activity that has prevailea, and of the stability and confidence manifested in every quar- COTTON KMANUFAQTURES. The transactions of the year in Manchester goods have been to an extent which has fully compensated for close profits. Subjoined is a retrospect from Mesrs. Rlobert Barbour and Brother *- "Throughout the year this district has fully shared in the unexampled energy which has characterized the general industry of the country. While the total exports of the year are expected to exceed those of 185.; by about S,000,000nl sterling, or 20 per cent., there is every proba{nhity of the exports of cotton yarn and manufactures showing an increase during the last 12 months of 10 per cent. Over 1855, and 20 per cent. over 1354. "The tendency in prices has been almost invariably upward throughout the year, but the advance on yarn and goods has not kept pace with the raw material. Cotton 2urinm the twelve months has advanced l1d. to ljd. per lb., or 25 per cent. Cotton yarn of the lower and medium numbers has advanced li,d to 2d. perlb., or 1,to 20 per cent.; s printing cloths, 6d. to 9d. per piece, or per cent.; 32-inch maddapollams (61b. double), about Is. to ls. 3d. per piece, or 20 per cent.; .36-inch shirtings, Is. 3d. per piece, or 15 per cent. ; 39-inch shirtings, for India and China, is. 3d. per piece, or 15 to 18 per cent. ; T-cloths, -6d. to 9d. per piece; and domestics, zd. to ld. per yard, or 15 per cent "The trade generally have to congratulate themselves Taore on the immense extent of business than on the amount of profit which has been realized. One or two large and a number of smaU firms have succumbed to the pressure and competition of the times, but, where establishments have been conducted on the best principles, with iniproved machinery, and a care taken to suit the production to the demand, enterprise and industry have not gone unrewarded. The working classes have been well and constantly employed, and there has never been any great accumulation of stock, as sales could be easily effected by making a slight concession on current prices. Though money throughout a considerable portion of the year has ranged froii 6 to 7 per cent. for the discount of commercial paper, it has had no sensible influence on the trade of the district, and accounts have been -quite as regularly paid as in former years. "1 The exorbitant price of cotton holds out but little prospect of satisfactory results for the ensuing year, either to the manufacturer or merchant connected with this dis-trict. It is feared that neither the home nor foreign markets wll readily respond to the advanced rates wlhich have already becomne current, and that there will be a continued -struggle and agitation between the manufacturing interest and the cotton nolders and speculators." SCOTCH IRON TRADE. The coarse of this market, which has been more steady than might have been anticipated, is thtas described by Mr. William Colvin, of Glasgow *- " This important department of trade has maintained a high state of prosperity throughout the year. "The range of quotations for pig iron (66s. to Sls.) has mot been so great as during many formner years, the market having for the past 12 months been more under the influence of bont fide dem,and than speculative excitement. The average price for the year is 72s. 6d. wch for mixed numbers. In January the niarket opened witlh much firmness at 75s., and by the 15th of the month 78s. 6d. had been paid; subsequently the tone became weaker, and, owin= to light exports and anxiety as to our peaceful relations vitli America eiemg continued, sales were pressed, and the price declined to 66s. by the middle of February. From this there was but a partial recovery until the beginning of April, when the announcement of peace with Russia, followed by an improved demand from America and the Continent, gave more buoy-ancy, and the trade began to purchase freely. About this period, also, a serious reduction in the snake took place in consequence of the turn-orut of the collers, whicb, iuducing speculators to operate, the price gradually hardened till it reached Sls. early in June. Upon the complete defeat of the workmen by their masters the price soon gave way, under forced sales, to 73s. " The course of the market now became characterized by great steadiness, partly owing to the relaxation in the rate -of discount, but chiefly on account of the heavy shipments ex store, makers being very low in stock, *until October, when financial stringency caused prices temporarily to -droop to. 67s., recovering, however, to 73s. towards the end of November, since when there has scarcely been any change worthy of notice. To-day the market has been steady at 73s. 6d. for mixed numbers, with a fair demand and some inquiry for spring delivery. " Al No. 1 g.m.b. may be quoted A5s. ; No. 3, 72s. ; No. 1 Calder, 77s. ; No. 1 American brands, 76s. to 78s. 6d. -cash against bill of lading. "Shipments are rather less than last year, but the increased iocal consumption both for forge and foundry purpores has reduced our stock to not exceeding 90,000 tons, of -which 25,500 tons are in store, the balance in makcers' hands. At present we have 123 furnaces in blast, and several new ones ready to blow in any large increase in production, how,ever, iS not expected. The position of the trade is generally regarded as encouraging, for, although our exports may -suffer by increased foreign production and the partial substitution of north of England and StaP.ordshire mavkes, yet it Is certain, from:, exi.sting contracts, that our local consumption must for some time be maintained at a high point. lSi6.

DOe. 31. 1S53 97 6i.2U0 " Annexed is a comparative statement of the trade for -the last three Years: ILNSEED. The excitement and uncertainty of this trade has been renmarkable throughout the year, owing to the influence of the question of peace or war on the sources of supply. The annexed statement is from Messrs. Edwards, Eastty and Co.:- "The past year has been one of surpassing interest as regards the article of linseed and its products, the trade presenting an enlarged aspect every season, owing to the growing mill power, which has quadrupled within the last 14 years. Twelve months since we were at war with the country usually supplying three-fourths of the entire growth cf the world; and, to judge from the warlike preparations then making, were likely to be dependent on our East Indian possessions for our wants until now. The unexpected acceptance by our enemy of the proposed conditions of peace staggered us all for a time; and, although we then believed that the disorganization of her resources must curtail our chief Russian supply for this season's use, all considerations, except that of getting out of stock, seemed disregarded, and the immediate fall in prices, rally, and subsequent panic which ensued, together with the gradual and permanent return to nearly previous rates, render the year 1856 a memorable one in the history of seed-crushing. The losses in the first sLx months must have been most serious, but, following on prosperous times and succeeded by an ususually profitable working seasonup to this date, the trade was probably never in a healthier condition. rhe retrospect is interesting, from the various fluctuaLions which have occurred, and we wish we could add also that the prospect of future supply was a subject for congratulation; but from all we can learn the prospects are anything but encouraging for the manufacturer. *- The year opened with a light stock of linseed, and a quiet but firnm market, at 76s. The prospect of peace sent the market to 70s., and before a month to 62s. Each succeeding sale marked a lower price, and it was not until we had reached a value similar to that touched in 1855 (when the news of the Czar's death arrived-namely, 56s.-that there was any return to confidence. A gradual ilprovemnent afterwards followed to 60s. per qnarter. Early in April the serious fall in cakes and oil which had oecurred (equal to 25s. per quarter for seed), together with the unfortunate failure of one of the largest holders of seed, cawed a perfect paic in prices, and as low as 47s. was accepted. Presently, however, seed on the spot was found very scarce, and an immediate reaction to 50s. foltowed, and was well sustained throughout April, May, and June, with a strong tendency to further improvement. In July the anxiety to provide for future wants showed the soundness of the market, and before that month closed we had advanced to 57s., which price, with very few fluctuations, was maintained until the niiddle of October. At this penod the, creasing shipments from India, and now apparent short kcplies from the south of Russia, caused a very speculative demand, and 6Ss. was realized on the spot, and s. to 66s. for floating cargoes of Black Sea. The market has scarcely varied since, except prices for arrival, which have been flat at Is. to 2s. decline, while seed on hand has been firm ab same rates. " The depression in oil and cakes bas deterred speculators 7rom continuing their opertions, and crushers could hardly be expected to compete with them while there was a certain loss of 3s. to 4s. per quarter at the relative value for crushing. A critical period is before Us. We have about 140,000 quarters in stock here and at Hull, and nearly 150,000 quarters afloat, to supply the demand until May mext. As, however, we have imported above 800,000 quartes during the last six months, the majority of crushers are well supplied, and, notwithstanding the great consumption -within that poriod, hold above average stocks for the time of year. The very discouraging prospects for 1857-1858 UUSt, however, exercise a great influence even on present prices; for, from no one district in }Russia is the crop spoken well of. On the contrary, everywhere are we led to expect short supplies, and, owsing to the heavy rains duriing the late harvest, iudiff,rent onality also. At the East Indies the competition of the Ainericans £or their yesrly-incrcasing wants makes us hope for but littleto this country, unless it sbould happen that the bigher foreign values induce the natives to supply their markets more freely again, and that our improving prices, setting off against the decline in America, may divert the shipments to this channeL The export at Calcutta since May last consisted of 160,000 quarters to America against 20,000 quarters to England, or eight times as much, while in 1855, during the same period, our supply was nearly double theirs, or p00,000 quarters to 100,000 quarters. In the autumn pYofitable tran6hipments of seed took Place from here to New York, and, from the tendency of their markets (according to the latest quotations), it is not improbable they may very soOII return the compliment." OILS. tinder this head Mlessrs. Wilson, Rose, Graham, and Co. furnish the following particulars "'.We question if any ether descriptions of merchandise during the continuance of the late war were influenced to a greater extent than those to which we devote our attention. At the commencement of the year just closed prices ruled at exorbitant rates; it was not to be wondered, therefore, that the abrupt, and to many unexpected, announcement of peace in the middle of January should have been followed by a sudden and great reaction, indeed temnporary panic, involving holders of produce in ruinous losses. But such a state of things wasnot of long duration; our markets rapidly recovered their wonted elasticity, and a large and legitimate business at improving prices has since been transacted in the face of liberal supplies of many articles which war prices naturally stimulated. The enhanced value of money, however, tended much to check speculative operations, but as the pressure is diminishing ve look forward to a good steady spring trade. " Linseed Oil.-The production during the last 12 months has been unprecedentedly large; we estimate the make in the united kingdom at not far short of 45,000 tons, notWithstanding which we begin the year with perhaps the smallest stock ever known. This is attributable to the immense quantities taken for exportation; from all ports we estimateit at20,000 tous, of which Rullalonesuppliedl3,000. The price has varied much, the extremes being 441. per ton in January, and 291. in March; in June it advanced to 331., in August to 371. 1s., September 401., since then the tendencv has been downwards, the value to-day being 371. 10s., at which there are buyers ior monthly deliveries up to Junie. "Rape and See4l Oils continue to occupy a prominent positionl in our mark. ts, owiug to the increasing quantities going into consumptioni for burning. Absence of supplies of Southern from our colonies, coupled with the high price of sperm, has much favoiired this. " Olive oils attracted little or no attention during the greater portion of last year, although unusually low rates were accepted during the summer months-in Mav and June 421. to 431. per tun for Mogador, and 471. to 481. for Gallipoli. Since then prices have been gradually advancing, although transactions have been very limaited until within the last two months, when more disposition was evinced to purchase. We now quote Gallipoli 571. 10s. to 5S1. per tin, and Magador 541, The importation into the kingdom will be about 23,500 tuns against 25,459 in 1855. "'Cocoanut Oil.-The apprehended deficiency in our imports during 1856 is fully confirmed, and it is now found we have only received 6,000 tons, against 12,300 in 1S53. The quantity taken for home consumption was about the same as the previous year, being 3,946 tons against 3,747, but the export demand was short-say 4,400 against 7,260, for the latter the enhanced value may account. Cochin, which could have been purchased at 371 per ton in February, was worth 401. in April, 461. in July, 481. in September, and the value to-day is 511. Ceylon we quote 491. " Palm Oil.-The importation last year into our port, especially in the early part of it, was far short of the requirements of consumers, and it ruled at rates out of proportion to the value of tallow and other articles having affinity. The lowest point reached was 38l. in June, the advance since has been gradual, and 461. per ton is to-day the value of fane Lagos. Our stock in London is 900 tons, and the importation into the kingdom about 35,000 tons against 40,519 in 1S65. "'Tallow.-Stra-;ge as it may appear, our importation into London last year was less than the previous one, rather a singular circumstance when it is borne in mind that during the whole of 1855 all the Russiau pores were in a state of blockades the lowest pOillt touched last year was 46s. in u ay and June; the tendency has since been gradualy upo ward; present prices are Ss. per cSt. on the spot, 57s. 9d.eto 5Ss. January to March ; 54s. to .54s. Sd. April to June; and 52s. 6d. to sos. kd. October to December. " Fish Oils.-The consumption of sperm was much checked during last year by the continuance of high prices, chiedly through speculative operations on the part of houses in the IJnited States who were likewise interested in our stocks here. In January 1271. per tuu was realized, since which stocks have been accuniulating and prices declining, the value to-day is 901., with every appearance of prices having seen their lowest; in common oils transactions have been unim3ortant; pale Soutbern may be quoted 491. ; pale seal, 501. 10s ; and cod, 491. 10s." TOBACCO. Regarding this product, which has been greatly affected by short supplies, Mr. Horatio N. Davis reports as follows:- " The year 1856 opened under unusually favourable auspices for a good range of prices, as the stock in Europe was reduced to less than half the average of the nine years preceding, and it was evident that more than one excessive crop mu the United States was required to augment stocks so as prejudicially to affect prices. In the autumn it was ascertained that about one-half only of the crops had been harvested in good order, while a part was prematurely cut, and that which remained standing was overtaken and damaged by frost. The effect of these casualties was immediate. In this country so small a proportion of the fresh supplies was sampled, and orders were so peremptory from shippers to withdraw from sale, that it was difficult to secare any parcels, even at an advance of 2d. per lb., but holders of old stock took the opportunity to realize. With the continued anxiety to purchase, prices experienced a further advance of from Id. to 2d. per pound, and attained a point, towards the end of the year, equal to that established in 1850 by the influence of a powerful speculation, at a time when the stock in Europe was double what it is now. The aggregate export from Almerica shows an excess upon that of the former year, and materially so upon the average ; still the stock iu Europe presents at this time a slight variation only front that of the last year, and is 24,483 bhds. below the average, and, bearing in mind that the crop to come forward will be a small one, it would appear that the stock remaining in America and Earope willbe nearly absorbed, provided the consumption continues in the same ratio it has latterly been, before another crop can be made available. In elucidation of this remark it may be observed that the combined stocks now in America and Europe, allowing for that held by Regies, is 73,000 hhds., and the cron grown in 1856-estimated at 138,000 hhds.-gives 211,00 hhds. as the supply, and, deducting the consumption as heretofore, the aggregate stock at this time in 1858. including that held by Regies, wil be nearly exhausted. This is the principal cause that has brought about the present elevated range of prices in every market; and, although thev may be affected by anticipation of exteissive crops this near,-which no doubt vwll be attempted to be raised in all tobacco-growing countries-it must be remembered they cannot be available in the markets of cossumption till towards the end of 1858. Experience, however, shows that anticipation materially affects markets, and therefore the cultivation this season will attract the particular attention of the trade. Although high prices seenl justified by existing circunmstances, they have already attained a susceptible point, and seem to have reached the views of shippers, who have, by recent letters, given more discretionary power to their agents here." FREIGET. The subjoined account of the freight trade of the past year, both as regards sailing and steam vessels, iS from Messrs. Alfred Laming and Co.:- "In January last we observed that the great impetus lvhich had been given to shipbuilding by the extraordinary demands of our Australian colonies iu 1853 would prove an effective barrier to any great and general imeprovement in the freight-market, and it must stiUl be admitted that we are labouring under the disadvantage of an excessive amount of tonnage. In face of a surplus tonnage, however, we gave hope of an improvement in homeward freights, by reason of an increase of imports likely to result from the then existing insuffieciency of the home and French harvest, the particular state of the timber trade, and that of our colonial markets generally; and it is now satisfactory to be able to refer in confirmation of our views to the increased imports of grain in the early part of 1856 from the United States, to the greatly increased importation during the same period of East India produce, and the large additional importation during the year of timber. Thus we find that the imports of gratn increased 43 per cent., and those of timber 37 per cent., as shown by the respective imports for the first 11 months of 1855 and 18-56 -namely,- COaI AND FLOUR, loss. asic. 5,31%,166 quarters .7,317,442 quarters. l,f77,29 c .wt. 3621,666 cawt. ,,1,491,222 loads . . 2oi049sos loads. "The abrupt termination of the war in March threw us into a reactionary condition, causing a diminished demand for touage, at the same time that it supplied tonnage in increased quantity; since, on the one hand, it put an end to the new demand from India of produce which in time oc peace was draw-n fron Russia, while, on the other, it threw out of employ a vast multitude of ships which had been used directly and indirectly for the purposes of the war. " In estimating the prospects for the current year, we cannot hide froni ourselves that we have far too much tonnage afloat for the purposes of our legitmate trade. Apart from that consideration, however, we are not without encouragement in hoping for an improvement. One favourable symptom is a growing conviction on the-part of shipowners that large colonial- built ships are less profitable than those of more moderate tonnage, and that fact, coupled with the existence of an indisputable general excess, justifies a belief that for the year a smaller aggregate tonnage will be launched. Now, we know that in the natural order of events, the tonnage already in existence will progressively disappear under the contingencies to which sueh property is liable, and that thus an effectual remedy will be supplied for the evil. We are glad to be able to report a favourable change opening up in the Australian trade. Guano, also, is deumanding a good supply of ships, no less than 50,000 tons having been taken up within the last few weeks for that article alone. The Persian war is likely to create a good demand. The Government have already chartered about 24,000 tons of transports, and much more must follow if the war is to be prosecuted with any vigour. "I We remarked last year ' that the steamvessels, numbering about 300, employed as transports by the British and French Governments, might at any,moment be brought into competitiox with our sailing ships, and that, although the legitimate extension of commerce, consequent on the restoration of peace, might absorb a part of the superfluous steam tonnage, it would be too much to expect that such extension could be effected with atJdiffient promptness to have much influence in psoteing uas againsst a sudden re- duction of steaum freight^ Soon after that event steam 1tahts, vwsiFh hs ug.avxioasly at 4-Va, hq 35, per tosi gross per month, commenced to go down, and continned declimng until they reached the present rate of 25sL to 20s. per ton, at which they are nearly nominal. We will cite, as well-ascertained examples, what bas taken place in the BaltUc trade, where we find steamers have actually superseded sailing ships to an extent which last year increased upon us is a very extraordinary manner, as exemplified by the following table, showing the number of steamers employed, and the voyages made to and from the Baltic ports: Steamers. Voyea. In the year18s20 .. 1851 .. . .. 15 .. 57 152 . 12 . 73 1853 . 26 .. 9 , 50 . 136 . 334 Now, we know, by the rates of freight obtained by the steamers, that this vast increase in 1856 was induced, not by the temptation of high freights, but solely by the necessity thrown upon steamships to seek employment in new services, the war, for which many of them were expressly built, having come to an end. This fact supphes an absolute proof that steam tonnage can afford to descend in its rate of freight sufficiently low to compete successfully with sailing ships for all destinations not very distant from the port of departure; and with this knowledge we see no reason to disbelieve that what has been successfully began may be continued and extended. In our opinion the time is rapidly approaching when for s ort voyages steam will be as a genera rule substituted for wind, we were long ago led to antipate by observing a ircumstance that screw ships could supersede saIling ships even as colliers, and, as we have lately been taught, rtthout having any advantage in the rate of freight per ton. The French Imperial decree, which came into operation on the 17th of October, 1855, and whilch has been extended to October next, has yetto a lmited extend only, been taken advantage of by oulr neighbours for the purchase of our surplus steam tonnage. Several sales have been effcted, hut larfe fleets of steam ships are still on the market. In connexion with the freight tradm e is the folloa - ing from MIessrs. Curry and Co., of Liverpool, on SALE OF SEn'S. The past year's business in the sale of shins at our port has beenl about as satisfactory as that of 1855, hut very different irom the onticipations of builders and holders, who generally believed that in proportion aes we removed from a state of war to that of peace we should find considerable improvement in shipping, as in every other department of trade, in place of which they have had to contend against the combination of lons freights almost everywhere and a vastly increased prce of money. Were it ne t for the steady enlargemenr of the trade of the country, and of our port in particular, combined with the necessity of supplying the enormous losses in shipping which have arisen in 1855-o, we should have had a very different year of business to report. The nlmber of vessels lost in 1855 on or near the coast of the united aingdoml amounts to 1,141 sail, mrae ing at aggregate of 176,60.0 tons. The official returns of 1856 have not yet leen completed, but there is reason to beleve the destruction ,ill he nearly, if not quite, eqal to that of 1855. At no period of the year have we been without a su7ply of ships of almost every class and size, at all times exceeding the demand, still we have not found many seller.s disposedto abate from their prices, and, though the tendency has been distinctly downward, inno month of the year has the reducton exceeded ] 2s. per ton, except for some few colonial seven years' classed vessels of large size that were sold at prices leaving the builder a shade under 71. per ton. we therefore qm)te the average for the past oear of first-class Ste John's and other colonial ships at ,1. 10s. to 71. ins. of from 1,000 to 1,200 tonS; some few of superior model and finish fronm 500 to 750 tons reached, and in a few instances exceeded, li. per ton. T The demand from France and other continental mar. kets has been very limited. bery few sailing vessels remaied in the Black Sea at the clcee of the war, and such as were not engaged to bring war storeS back to this country were qnickly absorbed in other trades, while a large proportion of the steamers in good workinag order were either rplaced on their original stations or pTchased or chartered by new joint-stock companies brought into existence under the l:,imited Liability Act. "eThe number of ships on sale here now is 118, equal to o5,418 tons. This is, doubtless, a large stock, there are, however, considerably fewer building or to come forwvard rom the colonies than were on the stocks or looked for this time last year. The number of ships that have chaned hands i the year is 694, equal to 328,991 tons, against 601, equal to 277,605 tons, in 1855. Of the«se 95 are new British equal to 41199G tons, against 84, equal to 37,072 tons, in 1855, and 12 are foreign, equal to 9,2.8 tons. The number of new colonial vessels that have arrived in Liverpool and bean sold is 91, equ!al to 62,546, against 102, equal to 70, 91L tons, tn 1o8a, showing a decrease of 11 ships, or 8,365 tons, on the return of last year, and making the average of each vessel 687 tons. The number of British shins sold to foreigners is 40. equal to 12,925 tons, against ol, equal to 17,387 tons, in 1855, and 20, equal to 9,462 tons, in 1854. Tphe number of steamers that kave changed hands is 26, equal to 7,936 tons, of which 12 are screw and 14 paddle. "1 Of British second-hand ships very few have appeared in the market, although there has been regular and constant inquiry for them, and in every case of saie exceUent prices have en obtained for such as have had a few years of unexpired A 1 class; those from 500 to 700 tons have been in the greatest demand. There is also good inquiry for small coasting vessels, from 80 to 200 tons, adapted for taking the ground, and for vessels suited to the West India trade, and that will shift without balast. " There is not much alteration in the prices of Britishbullt ships from last year. Screw steamers of all siz being in good working order, are much in demand. Coloniabuilt ships may be quoted as follows:-Very superior St. John's, hliramichi, and Quebec, to dass seven years A 1, 71. 10s. to 81. 5s.; ordinary, 71. t^ 71. 7s. ; clasing four years, 51. 5s. to 61. 6s. ; inferior, 41. 15s. to 51. Prince adward's Island and Nova Scotia in fair demand-say from 61. to 61. 10s.; the majority are worth from 41. to 51. per ton. " The most marked feature of the past year is the very increasing favour to which iron ships have succeeded with our shipowners. The great obstacles to their use being for the most part overcome (we mean the proper adjustment of the compasses and preserving the bottoms from fouling), they are destined to occupy a place in our merchant service tilU lately never anticipatecL" r. XV. Caudery states as follows regarding the trananctions in' CIIYMICALS. "The chymical trade has been ood, most of the articles connected with it having met wit¶ more than an average demand; and the increase in the consumption has caused a gradual advance in prices. This department, bowever, received a temporary check during the latter part of the snmmer, owing to several firms who were engaged in the trade (more especially in the export trade) having suspended payment. The excitement which followed soon abated, and a more healthy state of things foUowed as a natural result. " The foreign markets promise an extensive business for the coming year, as the German and Russian houses took but little last year in comparison with former years, while the American markets also are in a sound condition. It is fair, therefore, to conclude that the tendency will be to still higher prices. " Artificial manures continue to gain ground in the estimation of the farmers. The great thingt for them to avoid is a class of dealers which infest the country markets vending rubbish, and who are only seen for a season. The manure mostly to be recommended for general purposes is senperphosphate of lime, which continues to be the favourite for root and green crops, for which it is infinitely superior to Peruvian quano; it is also recommended for wheat and other descriptions of grain, by the additi jn of ammonia or nitrogenous matter. Chilian guano has been in good demand; the moderate price, coupled with its being a good manure, causes a ready sale for it. Peruvian guano is very scarce; the stock is only half what itwas last year, say about 40,000 tons, including about 15,000 tons of damaged."
COuLmY IN FORIIATONiS ATROTHERHAms.-&Veral informations against persons for breaches of the Coal Mines Inspection Ae wero heard before the West Riding isagn strates at Rotherham on Wednesday, at the instance of Mr 3Morton, Government inspector of mines for the district. Messrs. Richard Shaw and John Wright Potter, owners of a coliery at Park-gate, were summoned to answer seven informations, under the 18th and 19th of Victoria, cap. 108. charging them, first, with not having establshed special rules for the working of the mine, as required by sections 9 and 11; secondly, with not having supplied copies of the general rules to the workmen, and neglecting to hang up a copy of the same on the premises; thirdly, with not havng f enced off a pit out of use, or used only as an air pit ; fourthly, with not having fenced round a working pit when not at work; fifthly, with not having provided the working pit with proper means of signalling: sixthly, with not havPng provided a proper indicator to show the position of the (ode in the pit or shaft, and also with not having provided an adequate break to every machine worked by steam or water for lowering or raiaing persons in the pit; and, seventhly, with not having provided every steam boiler with a proper steam gauge and safety valve. MLr. Skipworth, of Wakefield, on behalf of the prosecution, stated rhat Mr. Potter had only recently become connected with the coliery, and was engag in qmute a different profession, so that he could hardly be expected to know the responsibilities of the zitbut MIr. Shaw had been connected with it mnch longer, and in SeDtember last had sat upon a jury appointed to inves.igate the circumstances attending a fatal explosion in the neighbouring pit of Mr. Stonton, and had concurred in casting blame upon him for neglecting the ordina recautions required in coalmines. Te defendants, according to previous notice, pleaded guilty; bit Mr. Potter, n mitigation of penalties, stated that the pit had come into their possession only in October last; that there had been every disposition to comply with the regulations of the act, and that they were now using every exertion to dosoina few days. The bench inflicted a penalty of 10s. for neglecting the special rules and a fine of ls. for each of the other breaches of the regulations. Mr. Gcorge Norburn, of Chesterfield, was summoned to answer an information which charged him with not having provided all his steam boilers with proper steam gauges and safety valves, according to the 7th general rule. he defendant pleaded guilty, but remarked that at the time the inspector was over, and also at the l,resent time, there was a steam gauge at work, which he considered superior to that recommended by Government. He kad, however, ordered gauges of the latter description, and they would shortly be fixed. The bench inflicted a nominal penalty of ls., but intimated to the defendant that he must strictly comply with the act.

The Doris is the second of the new class 32's, and sister ship to the Diadem. Major-General Sir Wlliam Codrington paid a visit to Woolwich yesterday morning. The entire battalions of Royal Artillery stationed at headquarters, Woolwich, assembled yesterdaymorning on parade at 7 a m., and went through a series of position drills, under the command of the adjutant on duty. The brigade of Royal Marines, in charge of Colonel Fleming, were paraded in the baraack-square at 1 p.m., and, headed by the band, they were marched to Woolwich Common, where there were inspected by Colonel Brown, Com mandant of the Marine garrison, and put through a course of field exercises and musket drill. The screw steam-frigate Shannon, 51, from Portsmouth, arrived in Plymouth Sound on Thursday evening, bound for Lisbon. The steamveszel Advice, from Pembroke, arrived at Plymouth on Thursday. The screw steamship Cornwalis, 60, Captain George G. WeUesley, having been repaired, was taken out of dock at Devonport on Thursday, and placed at her sailing moorings. The builders' contract for the construction of the paddle wheel steamer Bann, intended, together with the sister vessel Brune, for exploring purposes on the Nile, having been terminated, the ship was yesterday ordered down the river from Woolwich on a trial trip of her machinery prior to her being handed over to Government. Her Majesty's screw gunboat Clinker, Lieutenant-Commander Hudson (18A), late of the Royal Albert, arrived at Woolwich yesterday evening from the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. She sailed from Malta December 9th, Gibraltar the 19th, and Portsmouth on Tuesday last. She was obliged to make for Algiers in consequence of the severe stress of weather experienced in the Mediterranean, and had to beat against a succession of head-winds in crossing the bay, with a continuation of squalls during the voyage home. She is to be received in the outer basin of Woolwich dockyard to return stores and be paid off. An Admiralty order was yesterday morning received at Woolwich dockyard, forwarding instructions for LieutenantConrmander Jackson, EIer Majesty's ship Oberon, to be in readiness to be paid off. The Oberon arrived at Woolwich on Wednesday from Malta, and has been in present commission scarcely two years. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty:- Lieutenant P. R.

LAND-TAX. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Among the many arbitrary taxations to which Englishmen are subject none are more arbitrary thAn the land-tax, and none more perfectly inscrutable In the rule of its assessment. None, at the same time, are withont remedy for unfair and unequal rating except the land-tax. It is in its origin aproperty-tx and a war-tax, regulated by the hast act of Paxhament granting itthe3Ssh of George IIL, chap. 5,-s to its fiscal arraneements, under thie management of the Board of Inland Lei-enue; as to its assessment, it is in the hands of a local assessor, and a board of local commissioners, whose decsion is final. For two reasons I ask permission to bring the subject of this tax before the public; first, because its history is instructive in reference to the presen eagitahion or a permanent property-tac, as opposed to a upon income; and, secondly, because I am sffering a practical grievance from the assessment of the land-tax, nd one absolutely without remedy. By the act, each parish, ward, or place is charged with a fixed and permanent Guota of land-tax, which quota it is the duty of the assessor to asss, from year to year, bv an equa pound rate on all the lands and tenements which are in such parish or piace, according to the annual value thereof. All properties are chargeable, whether occupled and productive or not. Wh hen a party assessed shall be prepared to prove, to the satisfaction of the local comminsioners, that the assessment on him exceeds the equal pound-rate which he ought to hear, he has the right of axppeal to the commissioners, wsho have power to abate so much as it shall so exceed, and raise the sum so abated upon the whole parish, or on sach parts as shall appear nndercharged; and the decision of the commirssioners shall be final. Now, practically, it has always been understood that lanltax was a fixed chargeP roperty is every day sold subject to land-tx so much-" land-tax, 201. a-year." The lurking power of expansion has been forgotten. Nor, seeing that a fixed quota is to be raised from each district does it at first sight appear otherwise than a fixed tax. But now for a practical exemplification of the mode of assessment. I found some two or three years back that I was pVying exactly double land-tax to the previous amount. On investigation it appeared to have arisen from a halfyear's receipt being given for a year's payment, and the error carried forward was in danger of being perpetated and becoming an extra burden on the property of nearly 101. per annum. After infinite trouble I got a hearing on appeal to the commissioners, and was then curly informed they could make no alteration. Pressing the matter, one of the gentlemen,more communicative ana confidential than the rest, at last said, " Wby, you see, if we took it off you we must put it on some one eLse, and there would be only another appeaL We have to raise so much onthe whole and we cannot disturb the assessment." No regular time is fixed for appeals or meetings of the commissioners ; notice on the church doors is all thas is requisite ; but I succeeded in once more coming before the commissioners, and had this time armed myself with handbiUs of various sales by anction, showing property of such annual value was assessed at such a land-tax, and comparing that with my own I appealedon the ground of unequal rating. The assessor was now at the ear of the commissioners He was collector also of income-tax, and he at once gave the annual valne of my property, and told the commissioners the land-tax upon that was a. in the pound, as charged to me, and if it went to 4s. it could not be altered; others besides the appellant paid as much. I respectfully asked to aeo the books of assey ment, but was told, " they," the commissioners, "sat to decide, not to debate ," and so I had once more to quit the publchonse parlom-, which wa their court, without more satisfaction than on the previous occasion; and the decision of these gentlemen is finaL. Can any of sour readers tell me how to ascertain that the rating for land-x is uniform ' how to obtain the revision of assesKsment, ifjitla3noti and how to proveghtitit is not, or to be assured tat it is a I am, Sir, your obedient ser-antL L T.
Miss BuP.Dm CouTrs nri THE "FAR EAST."On Thursday evening (New Year's-day) upwards of 200 of the pauapers of the populous district of St. Peter's, Stepney, and 250 children were by the munificent liberality of M3ss Burdett Coutts regaled with a substantial Christmas supper of roast beef xnd plum-pudding, and excellent malt liquor, in te New Church Schools in E5sez-street.

Miss Burdett Coutts honoured tbe festival with her presence, attenaed by the Countess of Falmouth and Mrs. Brown. These new schools have been built at an expense of 1,5004, one-third of which has been kindly contributed by is Burdett Coutts; and the remainder (except 2401 still unnaid) has been raised by the exertions of Mr. Rowsell, te incumbent.

MR. LZANKQTO , M.P., AYD THRE )rGHr HON. I ATOX2 CADTEZlLP., TOXFORD. OXFORD, JALe. 2. Upwards of 400 members of Lodge 59 of the Aatient and Honourable Order of Druidcs and their friends partook as usual of a splendid banquet on New Year's Day, in the Town-ha which ws attended bq tbe city members, the Masyor, the Sheriff, the late Mayor, Alderen Sadler and Spiers, everal members of the tow-council, and many of the prncipal citizens. Mtr. Langeton, Mr. Card well, and JToha Bacon (the latter x working man, and secretary of the philanthropic fund) severally returned thanks. Mr. Jomy BAcoY first addressed the assemblage. Ho congratulated the Druids upon the flourisbing condition of their philanthropic fend, and proceeded to inmadvert upon various political topics. He referred to Italy, and contended that the state of that country must force A conviction that England had a great work to perform. Mr. Bacon then spoke of America, and gave his opinion that slavery could not trumph there without discredit to the Anglo-Saxon name. 'e supported the principles of religious and civil liberty, and vindicated te Order of Druids from thecarge made against them, that they were advocates fomr peace at any price. Mr. LN-,esTo-, in returning thanks, presumed that he might venture to allude to the events of the pat year, and to congratulate them on the attainment of peace, especially as these subjects were fully gone into bh his colleague and Brother Bacon at their last festival. (C,hees.) They were indebted for the peace which they now enjoyed to the speeches made not only in that haUl, but in every part of the kingdom, as they expressed the determination of the the people to support the Government in the carrying on of t e war, and it was that expression which had brought about that peace which he hoped would long endure. A short time ago the peace appeared not to be so lasting as it did now, but the rumours of war and commotion and doubts about the maintenance of peace were dispersed. It was true they were at war with Persia, but he had it on good authority that that unfortunate affair was likely to terminate before Parliament met. (Cheers.) During the past year there were some fears of war with America and with the tribes in Africa, and that war might be renewed in Europe, but those fears no longer existed, and he looked forward with hope to the enjoyment of universal peace. (Cheers.) Believing, as he did, that such would be the case, it would become the duty of Government to submit to Parliament a scheme for putting the establishment of this country on a proper scale, which would prove tlhe most economical in the end and prevent the recurrence of war, inasmuch as they would not then be taken unawares, or be fnprepare for so great an event. (Cheers.) It had been remarked in The Tima that the English people were very impatient about taxation, particularly with respect to the income-tax; but he (Mr. Langston) was confident, from a long knowledge of the citizens of Oxford, that while they would be impatient if called npoto paywhat they did not consider necessary, they n ld ways be ready and willing to bear their share of the burdens which might be deemed essential to the stability and well-being of the country. (Cheers.) He had been informed that it was their intention to hold a public meeting in this city for the purpose of expressing their willingress to pay taxes, but that they entertained certain objections to the income-tax, which they were led to believe would at the termination of the war be removed, and some other tax devised of a less objectionable character. (Cheers.) If he were right .r that conclwion, he could candidly teU them that he entertained the same objections himself; and they were still further strengtbened by his expenence as a commissioner of taxes and of the incometax. (Cheers.) There had been considerable agitation on this subject in Glocestershire, where one of the servants of Government had surcbarged a great many persons, who were obliged to go and mrake an oath that they had Pent in a fair return. There were sucb strong objections to that tax that he thought it should not be imposed unless it could be shown that the same amount could not be raised in any other way, and he hoped to see the tax so altered as to be deprived of its present objectionable character. Mr. CARDrWELL returned thanks, and said that it had been observed by Benjamin Franklin, in his advice to young men, when describing the miseries of a single man, that he was ILke the half of a1pdrof scissors, and of no utiity or ornament whatever. Lshter.) He (lir. Chrdell) bad always felt when he rose to address them singlehanded that he resembled Franklin's scissors by the absence of his friend and colleague 3Mr. Langston. In proportionate sincerity he rejoiced in his restoration to health and on his being able to join Lodge 59 on this festive occasion. He should imitate his example and conform to their rules and say a few words on the events of the past year and on the subjects which vere likelyto occupy the attention of Parliament in the year they had just entered. The year which had ran its course had not been witbout signal manifestations of God's mercy to this realm and to the people of this kingdom. Their lato mayor had carried to the foot of the Throne their congratulations on the restoration of peace to Europe; but scarcely was the seal affixed to that treaty when another danger of a far graver character threatened, not only the welfare of this kingdom, but of the whole world. If there could be a calamity more prejudicial to their welfare than any other, or tend more to roll back the flowing tide of human progress, it would be a serions rupture between the elder ahd younger branches of the Anglo-Saxon race-between this noble kingdom and that gigantic Republic which had .sread its arms from the Pacifie to the Atlantic-a people descended from the same origin, speaking the same language, their friends and rivals in commerce and maritime power, spretaing their literature and laws, and diffusing with them tbe prindples of civilization and human progress over all the nations of the globe. (Cheers.) By mutual good feeling and observance of mutualgood sense on both sides, which were the characteristics of the race, that calamity had happily boen averted. (Cheers.) He believed that their relations with that country never stood on a more per.nanent basis, and he hoped that a long career of usefulness s open to the whole of. this great Anglo-Saxon race. (Cheers.) Although the cloud in the West was dispelled, there was no doubt that some streaks of darkness prevailed in the Eastern horizon; but he believed that the danger would be averted, and he trusted that the year which had just closed had ended the reign of discord among mankind. (Cheers.) What, then, wvere the anticipations, and what were their duties in the year they were now entering 7 While they reflected with gratitude and pride on the heroic services of those who not onily sustained, but exalted in the face of the whole world the ancient fame of England (cheers)-while they looked back with pride on the records of martial intrepidity, unpsraUeled in history, they might look forward to 1857 with sanguine expectations that in the rela.ions of commerce and in the enterprising and successful pursuits of industry they might add to the power and greatness of this country. (Cheers.) Their first duty in the House of Commons would be to apportion on the return of peace the scale of expenditure befitting this great commercial country, on the one hand not slow to defend those establishments whicb were the best safeguards of their interests an1 the beat guarantee for a permanent and enduring peace (cheers), and on the other band determined to retrench all unnecessary expenditure, and to give the country the benefit of a proper remission of taxation. (Cheers) He had no doubt that the Goverument would take an carly opportunity of setting their views before the country, and it would bea sincere pleasure to him to support them in the prosecation of that policy which he had ventured to allude to. (Cheer) There was no part of the duty of a member of Parliament which he discharged with so much pleasure as supporting the renission of pablic burdens. He bad had the honour of serving in Her Miajestys Treasury when greater remissions of taxationawere made thinat anyprevious time in the financial history of this country. It ws not possible to avoid witnessngAitsresult and its effect, not only on the material interests of the kingdom, but morally on all wbho Evod by labour, placing them, as it did, in oesier circumstances, and giving them an appetite for higher things and for the cultivation of the intellectual powers. (Cheers) They could not witness such effects without wishing to have a fair and proper mitigation of the public burdens; but at the same time he thought it would be unfair to the Government, when theywere about to enter into a full statement of their views, to interfere and attempt to forestall them by macking any statement as to this or that pecular bnrden. (Choers.) Believing, as he did, that they would faithfully fulfil their duties and give expression to their opinions, he felt a&ssured that the House of Commons would give them a calm and dispassionate attention, and he should rejoice if their policy for the readjustment of the public burdens was such as to entitle them to the support of the House of Commons. (Cbeers.) His hon. colleague had reminded them of the vexation belonging to the incometax, and it wasthe duty of every Government and every House of Commons to mitigate its abrdships by every means in their power. fCheems.) When that branch of the revenue recently lost its chairmxn by death, the person appointed to fiU his place was O partisan, but one who bad risen from the lowest ranks of the service- he had been a commuissioner, and was made chairman of the oaxrd of Inland Revenue for no other reason but his just and faithful services in the lower branches Although he (Mr. Cardwell) was not cognizant of what had been going on at Glocester in reference to the income-tax, he argued from the appointment of Mr. Pressly to the Chairmanship of the Boarof Inland Revenue, that any complaints made to him would meet with alU the attention which the people had a right to expect. (Cheers.) He did not know w^ether his hearers had rcad a work recently written by the P-cat French orator and statesman, AL Gui=ot, who, in speaking of the events of 20 years ago, and his personal intimacy with the late Sir B. Peel, remarked that the trait in the character of that lamented statesman which struck him most was the deep an3ciety he felt about the condition of the labouring-classes of this country, which he said was a danger and disfrace to civilization, and that instant measures ought to be taxen to remedy it. He (Mr. Cardwdl) asked them to consider what had been done since that time, not only by one Government, but by suceasive Governments, and he could refer to such measres without running the risk of exdting any discord among them.

AMEErING OF THE SW ISS Ir LONDN. last night a meeting of the Swiss. resident in London: was held at Radleys Roteil Blackfriars, to consider an address to the Federal Concil upon the questions in disp ate between their fatherland and the King of Prussia. Care was taken that the meeting was confined to Swiss. Shortly after 7 o'clock the large room of the hotel wa& filled by an assembly at once enthusiastic and unanimous. The proceedings were conducted in the French language. The chair was taken by 3L John Rapp, Consul-General of the Swi.s Confederation, who was hupported by 1. A. Doxat, IL Jules Bordier, K J. C. un Thurn, IL J. Patry, .L G. Provos; IL .A. P. Prevost, ML C. * errey, Al. A. Pasteur, hr. Jules Stauffer, M. P. Bro6, M. C. Eovet, 3iGustave Bovet, W. P. Walther, L Beeaume, l. J. 'W. Bae.schlin, X. Pictet, Captain Kesse, kc. The CRA1BR3t1A opened the proceedings by expressisg a hope that the meeting wonld be conducted with the moderation and judgment which ought to characterize L publc assembly. M. P. BioE, having been caUed upon by the chairman, said, he should hesitate in addressing such an assembly if he did not know that each of his words would find an indulgent and eloquent echo in their hearts. (Cheers.) He knew that they would male up by the warmth of their sentiments for the feebleness of his expressions. They were all aware of the gravity of the events which were tak-ing place in Switzerland. A cry of alarm had arisen among the Swiss both at home and abroad. They had felt the need of union, of calculating their means of defence, of taking counsel how they nmight be most useful to their common country. It wras scarcely necessary in such an assembly to recapitulate the circumstances which had led to the critical position in which Switzerland found herself. Neuch&itel, whose liberties dated from the year 1214, and 'those alliance with the Swiss might be traced back to its earliest existence, riveted in 1815 the bands wbich united her to Switzlerland by sining tlie Federal Pact. The nominal rights of the Prince of Neuchfitel-rights which had had no real force and virtue except by the sanction given to them by the States of Neuchttel in l07-were at a later period annulled when the Nenchiitelais acknowledged the new constitution which put this State in the rank of a free and confederated canton. Eight years passed, and under the order of things thus established, without the Prince having claimed his rights or invoked the treaties said to be in his favour, in a time of profound peace a movement took place in the canton to establish hic nauthority. The insurgents were taken prisoners with anns in their hands. In attacking the legal Government of their canton in the name of a foreign Prince they had braved the authority of the Confederation and attacked its territory. From that moment they became amenable to the Federal TribunaL The Prince of NeuchAtel, who had not himself the right to claim his authority by the strong arm, even when it stiU 'had the shadow of legality, interfered, and demanded that Switzerland should release the prisoners. The Federal Council refused. The Prince then vanished behind the King of Prussia, who threatened Switzerland with. an arnmed occupation. Switzerland immediately showed signs of an energetic resistance. It was then that . neighbouring monarch, to whom SwitzerLand once accorded its ,hospitality (cheers), forgetting for a moment under tho mperlal purplethe simple offlcerof artilleryto whom, and in favour of whom, Svitzerland had before given an example of heroic devotion, interfered, and considered it his duty to recommend Switzerland to yield. He ought to have known that the word never had found and never would find a place in the Swiss dictionary. (Loud chers.) A universal cry was heard, "cxistaiinc au jnix de natr-csang." (Cheers.) All parties tendered each other the hand to sustain the Federal banner. Loans were voted and subscribed by men of all opinions. Could the Swiss now scattered in foreign lands remain mute spectators of such scenes ? The voice of their common country had not oeased to vibrate in their hearts, nor had the battlefields of Sempach or Morgarten ceased to be p resent to their memory. They felt the need of union with theircountrivmen atbome,inorderthatthey might partake their sacrifices and their dangers. Let them stand firmly together, so that there might no longer be Berneso, or Vaudois, or NeuciAtelais, or Bi.lais, or Genevais, or-Conservatives, or Radicals. Let there only be Swiss asmong them hastening to the defence of their country, its independence, and its libertics. (Checrs.) Switzerland would then display a sublime example which would gain for her the respect of Europe and of the civilized world. Let thest remember that the eyes of Switzerland were upon tbem, and that their proceedings would exercise an immense moral influence among their rellow.countrysnen. (Cheers.) I.. Broe concluded by propssing the adoption of the folowing address to the Federal Council of Swit7erland:- II3Ionsiour le President et lessieurs les Membres dni Conseil FWddral, Berne.

I Que Die protcge la Suisse ! 1L STwr;rFeR seconded the motion. He said it was not the first time that the Swiss had taken up arms of late' years, but in some former combats there wero Swiss against Swiss; now the Swiss were united like one man. Switzerland hadneverwanted men of talent worthy of her old renovn. In 1837 she had Neuhaus; in 1847 be boasted an Ochsenbein, and now in 1&-ti hbe had a Stanmpili. Switzerland, too, had always found good gencral and she would, ha trusted, never want men who would load her armies to conquer, or, if not, to die. (Cheers.) They had great remson to thank the Federal Council that it had so nobly fulfilled the wishes of the Swiss nation. He could answer for his countrymen in this metropolis that tbey were ready to, make the last sacrifices for Switzerland, and if the Fderal Council required men as wel as money they should have tbe u. (Cheers.) The address was unsnimnously adopted, and a hearty cheer a la Suise was given with threo times three IL Bormir.T said, it was the duty of the Swiss abroad to open a subsciption to assist such fanilies .as migbt be left in want b their husbands and fathers being called to arm& HIe had, tnerefore, to propose that a subscnption be opened for the rUlief of the families of the soldiers of the Cantons. 3L.

We have received the following telegraphic despatch from our Paris correspondent:- " PARIS, FRIDAY, JAN. 2, 8.30 A.M. "The Monicescr announces that the Senate and Legislative body are convoked for the 16th of February." (FROM Ota Owi oo4REs1oONOrDN.) PAWS, TIIURSDAY, 6 P.M. This being the day of the grand receptioPs at the Tuileries there was no Conference held. The ceremonial, which was similar to that of preceding occasions, commenced in the apartments of the Empress at half-past 11 o'clock, when the Princes and Princesses of the Imperial family and the Princes and Princesses of the family of the Emaperor having rank at Court were received by their Majesties. The Grand Officers of the Crown, the Grand Mistress of the Enmpress's Household, the Governess of the " Children of France," and the other functionaries, male and female; the Princess Mathilde, the General comunanding the Imperial Guard, the Adjutant-General of the Palace, and the Aidede-Camr on duty were assembled in the principal saloon, or Salon des Tapisseries.

At 12 o'clock the magistrates repaired to the Cbapel of the Palace, preceded by the grand dignitaries of the Crown, and followed byPrince Jerome, Prince Napoleon, the Princess Mathilde, the Princes and Princesses of the Empire holding rank at Court, and the grand officers of the household. The Emperor and Empress occupied the central gallery; the Princes to the right of the Emperor, the Princesses to the left of the Empress; and behind was the Grand Marshal of the Palace, the First Almoner on his right, and on his left the Grand Chamberlain, with the other functionaries placed in order of rank. After Divine service their Majesties entered their apartmnents in the same order as they left them. At I o'clock the Emperor entered the Throne-room, where the members of the Diplomatic Corps were standing opposite the throne. The Emperor passed before them, and they were presented in turn by the Grand Master of the Ceremonies. After presentation the Diplomatic Corps retired by the Galerie de Diane. The reception of the civil authorities, the National Guard, and the Army, took place at I o'clock in the Throne-room, the Emperor seated on the throne. On His Majesty's right hand were Prince Jerome, Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, and Prince Joachim Murat; and on his left Prince Napoleon and Prince Lucien Murat. The Grand Dignitaries stood to the right and left of the Princes. The Grand Master of the Cerenmonies presented in order' -the Senate, Legislative Body, Council of State, the Deputation of the Grand Officers of the Legion of Honour, the Court of Cassation, the Court of Accounts, the Imperial Council of Public Instruction, the Institute of France, the Imperial Court of Paris, the Archbishop of Paris and his clergy, the Chapter of St. Denis, the Central Council of the Reformed Churches, the Consistory of the Reformed Church of Paris, the President of the Superior Consistory and of the Directory of the Church of the Confession of Augsburg, the Central Consistory of the Israelites, the Prefect of the Department of the Seine, Prefect of Police, Municipal Council of Paris and the department of the Seine; the Mayors and Deputy-Mayors of Paris, the SubPrefect of the arrondissement of Sceaux, &c.

The receptions lasted till half-past 2 o'clock. All were, of course, in full dress. The rest of the presentations will take place to-morrow night at 9 o'clock. Prince Jerome gives a grand dinner this evening to Prince Louis Lucien and the great functionaries of State, at his residence in the Palais Royal. The followving is the invitation addressed by the Duke de Cambac6rbs, Grand Master of the Ceremonies, to his Imperial Highness Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte:- " Xonseigneur,-I have the honour to inform your Pfigh. ness, by order of the Emperor, that you will be received by their Majesties on the occasion of the new year, the 1st of January, 1S57, at half-past 11 in the morning, in the apart. ments of the Ernpress at the Palace of the Tuileries. Your Highness will be pleased to accompany their Majestiethrough the different sal.ons, to receive the homage of the household, the Cardinals, Ministers, Marshals, Admirals, and high functionaries of State, and afterwards to the maS4 which will be celebrated in the chapel of the palace. TheiMajesties will withdraw to their apartments after the mass The Emperor, after having rramained there some minutes, will preceed to the Throne.room to receive the Corps Diplo. matique, the constituLted corporations, and the civil and military authorities. Your Highness is likewise invited to accompany bim, and to place yourself at his side, when Hiis Imperial Majesty shall take his seat on the throne. Their Majesties will receive, at 9 o'clock in the evening of the 2d of January, the ladies and the chiefs of the Diplomatic Corps, together w,ith the Freach and foreign ladies who have been presented to them. Your Highness, Monseigneur, is invited to attend these receptionzs, ad to proceed for this purpose to the apartments of the Empress. The cowge will proceed thence to the Throne-room. Your Highness will place yourself beside their Majesties when they are seated on the throne. "I have the honour to transmit to your Highness the programme as approved by the Emperor for these recep. tions. please to accept the homage of respect with which I have the honour to be, Monseigneur, "Your Highness's very obedient servant, " CAMBACERES, "Grand Master of the Ceremonies." T-he usual crowds were assembled in the streets contiguous to the palace to witness the arrival and departure of the equipages. Very little of a positive kind is known of the deliberations of the Congress yesterday. It has transpired, however, or rather it is rumaoured, that the question of the evacuation of the Black Sea was mooted, and that the English Plenipotentiary, while admitting the principle of the evacuation, stated that he would refer to his Government before fixing the precise date. The writer of the political article in the last number of the Revue des Dews, Mo,des, which ap. peared to-day, blames the Swiss Confederation for not having accepted the intervention of France unconditionally, the simple fact of the intervention of the FrenchGovernmuent being, as he says, a sufficient guaraatee that the King of Prussia would have renounced his rights of sovereignty in the Canton of Neuchatel. -France bound herself to Switzerland by her mediation, as she was already bound by her poltical interests and by her traditional relations The writer then considers the right claimed by the King of Prussia, which he observes is a mere abstract nominal right, founded on the treaties oF Vienna, and whic1 does not destroy the indepen- dence of the Canton of Neuchhtel, as recognized by the same treaties. It is not difficult to conceive, ac. cordi-g to the Revue des Deux Mondes, that the King of Prussia, "actuated by a just susceptibility," should wish to abdicate in a dignified manner, and not appear to yield to the pressure of an accom- plished fact his prerogatives of sovereignty, more honorary than real. The King is said to have com- ported himself with exemplary moderation during the last war, and to have carefully declined auy eugagement which might lead him to take UD arms. He consequently cannot entertai the idea of making war on Switzerland for the conquest of Neuchatel. Such an enterprise is at. tended with difficulty He has not yet obtained peruisaion to march ns troops through the German States. The Diet of Flioldt has admitted the right of the King to Neuchatel theoretically, but it denies the use of armi. Ou tnc*uwa conBequently oncur m mpoeing 011 thi4 BEropem Powers the obligation to attempt a rww o4bg1 ot Aonciliation. One essential fact is eO denj tht a u iversal effort is now making to prevent a co.&ct, of wzhiac the impossibility is appuet tie more the quesion is studieod. A letter dated 7th of November, published in tho Monite,r de AI'Am&e, and said to be written by a foreign officer attached to the daff of the Sirdar Murad Mirza, contains some new details relative to the operations of the Persian army after the capture of Herat. The writer says:- " The first care of the Sirdar, after he entered Herat, was to fll the trenches and place the town in a state of defence, ia case he should be attacked by the Affghans. He ordered that the lives and properties of the inhabitants of every religion should be respected, and three soldiers who broke into the house of a Jew wereputto death. Aftertheir execution their heads were exposed for eight days, which produced a salutary effect. The day after his entrance into Herat the Sirdar restored the aqueduct, which had been de. stroyedduring tie siege. When the water againappearedin the fountainstheinhabitants flocked in crowdsto the mosquec to return thanks to God. The third day some merchants from Bolhara announced that Gholab Haider Khan, a son of Dost Mahonmed, was at Furrah at the head of a considerable force, and that he was manceuvring to effect a junc. tion with Nelab Khan, one of his fatherabestGenerals, who was in Seistan at the head of the tribes of Zereh. The Sirdar despatched two squadrons of cavalry to ascertain the truth of the information, which was found to be correct. The Sirdar next consulted the Court Astrologer, who had been sent by the Shah to asst the Generai with his advice. The Astrologer was of opinion that the information received was worthy of consideration. Murad Mirza Khan then formed a corps d'acernAe, composed of two brigades of iufantry, a brigade of cavalry, and two batteries of artillery, and gave orders to General Djeschim lban to advance with these troops. He recommended him to maintain his communication 'with head-quarters, and promised to support him. At the date of the latest news the Persian expedition, after a rapid, though difficult march, had traversed the most ancultivated portion of Affghanistan, and had arrived at Furrah, a large town half-way between Herat and Candahar, where he had established himself. The Persian General had seen -nothing of Gholab Raider lilan, who had retreated into the interior, in order to entice his enemy to quit his base of operations. The Persian General, aware of his adversary's plan, resolved to maintain himself at Furrah, where he can watch the entire of Cabul. A great number of the tribes of Seistan and Candahar had sent their chiefs to make their submisdon to the Shah of Persia. The town of Furrah is an important strategical point for the operations which are about to commence. It is difficult to explain why the Afighans did not defend it." The writer of this letter moreover remarks, that this fact demonstrates that the Court of Persia has numerous partisans in that country, and that Dost Mahomed does not feel himself sufficiently strong to risk a battle. Notw-ithstanding these advantages the Shah professeto be always ready to enter into arrangements with the British Government, and to avoid a war too expensive for his finances. Furrah, situate in an extensive plain, is the principal station of the caravans proceeding from erat to Candahar. It was built by Mahmoud of Ghuznee, who died in the year 1030, and whose magnificent tomb still exists at Ghuznee. The palace erected by that prince was repaired by Nadir Shah in 1725, and still exists. The town of Furrah is surrounded by a wall, with bastions flanked by four octagonal towers in tolerably good condition. In 1838 the fortifications of Furrah were repaired under the direction of an English engineer officer, who was sent from Bombay for that purpose. A letter dated St. Petersburg the 23d of De. cember, published in the Journal des D6bats, says:- " There is no doubt that a convention has been concluded between this Government and Persia with a view to certain eventualities. The Court of Teheran will probably accede to a wish of Russia, and give up to her on tho Araxes a point which forms the limit of the two States. This point is of great importance as regards the unaubdued Turcomans, who seriously disturb the Russian frontier. At the place where the Araxes falls into the Caspian Sea there isa a small island which Persia recently allowed the Rassians to occupy. The negotiations relative to the cession of a small portion of territory on the Araxes are stiU pending. Under any circumstances Persia will endeavour, before having recourse to Russia, to arrange her differences with England. It is thought here that Persia wil consent to abandon her co4quest of Herat, if England wil make some concessions which are necessary for the safety of the Persian frontier." The same letter'adds:- " The accounts which have been given of the concentration of a considerable military force near Bakou, on the Caspian, are confimed. These troops are composed of picked regiments from the Caucasms. The other troops concentrated in the Caucasu4s're very numerous; the five corps of which they are composed can act in concert at any given moment, In addition to the corps of Bakou, which belongs to the army of the Caucasus, and which, in case of need could proceed to Persia, there is another corps, that of Oren. burg, which, if required, could take part in an expedition. It would be destined to invade the territory of the Affghans, and prevent them from fighting against Persia in concert with England. The troops would'proceed from Orenburg by the road followed by the expedition of Perowski on K.hiva. Permanent pickets of Cossacks have been established on this road, as well as wells and other establish. ments of great importance to an army when marching across such wastes., To-day being New Year's-day, the Bourse and public offices are closed. A Council of Ministers, at which the Emperor presided, was held yesterday at the Tuileries. By an Imperial decree M.Durand d'lJbraye, Commissary-General of the Marine and Director of the Administration of the Ministry of Marine, has been named governor of the French establishments in India, in the room of Rear-Admiral Verninac, who has been recalled to France at his own request. M. Ruffio, commissary of marine, first class, succeeds M. Durand d'Ubraye. Placards containing menaces of death against the Emperor having been found posted up some short time back in the Rue Neuve des 3lIathurins, in Pari3,the police endeavoured to discover the author of them. A tailor named Wattebled was arrested shortly after with two similar placards in his possession. Being brought to trial yesterday before the Correctional Tribunal, he was condemned to 15 months' imprisonment and 50f. fine. The 1Patrie says:- " A person confined for debt in the prison in the Rue de Clichy was yesterday morming fired at and kiled by one of the sentinels for putting his head out of the window. The soldier is said to have called to him five or six times to retire, but, the injunction not being attended to, the man fired. The sentinel in his defence says that when on duty at another prison he had received orders to act as he had now done; but it aPpears that such rigorous measures are only applicable to criminlprsvns. It is said that the deceased was an American merchant, who was to have been released in the course of the day." M. de Deber3tein, an attachl of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has arrived at Marseilles. He has come to receive Feruk Khan, the Persian AMba3sador, who is daily expected. The S&maphore of Marseilles publishes a letter from Canton of the 14th November, brought by the Valetta, which gives a French version of the affair at Canton:- " The city of Canton is in consternation in consequence of England having declared war against China under the following circumstances :-A junk canrying the British flag had on board the son of a Chinaman, who had taken to flight after committing murder. According to the Chineme law, the son is responsible for the father. The police of the country accordingly made a descent on tho vessel to seize the young man. The captain having refused to give him up, the Chinese, exasperated, tore down, as is said, the flag of the vessel and trampled it under foot. The English Consul, having seen i this act an insult to his nation, immediately summoned the naval forces under the command of Admiral Seymour. The Admiral demanded reparation for the outrage from the Chinese authorities. The Viceroy of Canton made a very firm reply, whioh did not content the Admiral, and tho English squadron opened fire against the city. Afterhaving burnt down the Chinese quarters,situate on the banks of the river, the Admiral made a landing with somehundred3Marines. The Viceroy, whose palace was fired on, retired into the interior, and the English no longer met with reistance. For some days the fire has ceased, the Chinese only making a passive opposition. Commerce is completely paralyzed. All the European firms of Canton have been obliged to close, End it is impossible to foresee wvhen this state of things will cease. "P.S. Nov. 15.-It is announced that tho English have just seized the Chinese forts at the Bocca Tigris. It is feared that the Europeans will be obliged to leave a)l their establishments on thb coast of China. The reply to the uUimalum of the English Admiral is not yet known." AUSTRIA. (FoR oifl OWN COB.RSPIONDENT.) VEENA, DEc. 30. Even the beat-informed persons in this t apear to be ignorant of the actual state of the Neuch&tel question. The only two facts positively known are-first, that the French Cabinet is sill mediati between Switzerland and Prussia; an seeondl, that both France and Austia have advised th Prusian Government not to be too precipitate in its movements. It is also credibly related that the last proposin made by the French Government to the Feaera Council has been well received; but the prevalent opinion among the Vienna diplomatists is, that the Neuchatel question will not be definitiveksettled until all the parties to the London protocol of 1852 have taken the matter in hand. The -'rankfert Post-Zeituh ns and several other influential organs of the German press are doingaU in their power to injure the causa of the Swiss. Nothing is said of the original cause of the excitement which at present prevails in Switzerland, buthe public is assured that " the Swiss have hoisted the revolutionary banner and are about to wage war against the social institutions of Europe." Th - very same language is employed by the Austrian ultramontane organs, and the Paris correspondents of some of the Vienna papers appear to have received instructions to vilify the Swiss in every possible way. We are told by these gentlermen that half the professional revolutionists of Europe are to be found in the Swiss army; but the enemies of the little republic have overshot the mark, for it is a notorious fact that only Swiss burghers are permitted to serve under the Swiss flag. Many persons are inclined to believe that the Swiss are not rich enough to indulge in such an expensive luxury as war; but a person who has passed the greater part of his life either in Switzerland or in its imumediate neighbourhood assures me that the Basle and Zurich merchants aud bankers are able to advance any tum which may be required by the Confederation. The Federal Council has however, thought fit to apply to the Stuttgard Bank for money, and that establishment is said to have agreed to advance any sum that may be re, quired. It is worthy of mention that the King of WVurtemberg, who has consented to permit Prassian troops to march through his territories, is the owner of about three-fourths of the capital of the Stuttgard "HIoS-Bank" (Court Bank). On the 26th of December it was related in the first financial circles of Frankfort that Prussia and Switzerland had agreed to let the German Bund act as arbiter between them, but the report is devoid of all foundation. On the 26th all the men belonging to the regiment quartered in Constance, in the Grand Duchy of Baden, who were on furlough, were suimmoned to return to their flag. The Baden Government seems to fear that a war between Switzerlaud and Prussia would spread beyond the frontiers of the first mentioned country, for orders have been issued to construct redoubts oa that side of Constance which is nearest the territory of the republic. Pickets are already placed on the frontiers, and the troops in Constance have received a fresh supply of ammunition. A Swiss battalion entered KAreuzlingen and Emishofen on Christmas-day, and, as these places are within sight of Constance, the inhabitants of that city were greatly alarmed. The six Swiss steamers on the Lake of Constance are to be kept in readiness for military purposes. In order that no injury should be done to the castle of Arenemberg, which is the property of the Emperor Napoleon, a detachment of troops has been sent to guard it. Almost all the Swiss residing in Munich returned to their native country before they received any summons to do so. The necessary preparations for war are being made with remarkable energy in all the Swiss cantons. The authorities of Geneva have addressed a proclamation to the militia of the canton, ordering it to be prepared to take the field at a thort notice. The Government of Freiburg has granted such a large credit to the military authorities that they will be able to send a first-rate contingent to the Federal army. In Waadt (Pays de Vaud) the young men have'voluntarily formed a corps. Indeed, there is such a warlike spirit in the canton that 25,000 men might be raised without any difficulty. In Aargau great numbers of beardless boys offered their services to the authorities of the canton, but, of course, they were immediately sent to their homes. The little canton of Thurgau sends a contingent of more than 8,000 men. In Grauabunden the whole of the militia is to be placed on a war footing, and the men of Basle, Schaffhausen, and Berne are busily employed in preparing for the defence of their "penates." A military organization is to be given to all the "shooting clubs" in the different cantons, and the women who are inclined to imitate the example of Miss Nightingale have to present themselves to the cantonal authorities. q'wo or three hundred Royalists have escaped from NeuchAtel, Loele, and Chauxdefonds to France, in order to avoid being obliged to serve against Prussia, but Colonel Perrot, of the Artillery, has offered his services to the republic, although he openly professes Royalist principles. The Oeterreichdshe Zeitung states that 300 nobles with Count Giulio Litta at their head, intend to meet their Majesties at the last stage before Milan, but it is not known in official circles that any such plan has been formed. Among the persons who have expressed an intention to pay their respects to the Emperor are the Princess Belgioso, who not long since returned from exile, and the Marquis Crivelli, who has repeatedly been arrested by the Sardinian writers for the foreign press. The feeling among the lower classes in Lombrdy is better than it was, but the higher and middle classes have no more syinpathywith Austria than they had a year since. Many persons have recently been arrested at Venice, but there is no reason to believe that any conspiracy has been discovered. The attempt on the life of the King of Naples greatly alarmed the Venice authorities, and it is not improbable that some persons of notoriously bad character have been put under lock and key in order to deprive them of the power of doing mischief. The feeling of the lower classes in Austria towards the clergy becomes worse from cay to day, and the time will assuredly come when the civil authorities wiiU be obliged to protect the servants of the church from insult. Many persons have recently got into difficulties for railing at the priesthood in coffeehouses and publichouses, but the offence is becoming so common that the authorities are quite at a loss how to act. That the Concordat and the new Marriage Laws are the two great causes of the hostility of the people to their spiritual pastors and masters need hardly be said. In its number of this morning the Kirchean Zeitung, the organ of the Jesuits, is at great pains to prove that the Catholic world was never so happy as when the Inquisition was in the habit of roasting and grilling those persons who did not implicitly believe all the dogmas of the Roman Church. Out of the 400,000 Catholics who inhabit this city how many believe the dogma of the Immaculate Conception ? The " Brethren of St. John," of whom mention was made in my correspondence about a-year ago, are increasing in number, and the lower classes no longer ridicule them as they were aceustomed to do some months since. The manner of life of these people is so extremely blameless that it is painful to the authorities to be obliged to molest them; but the Church will not recognize any new sect, and therefore,every follower of St. John who has not a riPht to live in Vienna is sent awy from the city. The regular Viennese who indulge in sectarianism are locked up and receive religious instruction from ortioox priests while in confinement. _PRIJSSIA. (MoM on owNi OoPofNDizT.) BERLIN, Dz:c. 31. The rstreets of Berlin present at all times a highly military asPect to an Englishman's eye from the circumstance that in the town, which is about onefifth the size of London, there is always a gaon of about 11,000 men, and aU the officers connected dwith it always wear their uniforms when out of doors; plainclothes are resorted to on very rare occasions, not even for attendane at Divine rervice or for a visit to the Chambers; and mufti is unklown. Within the last few days, however, the streets at tho west-end, which is here also the fashionable end-the reio of palaces, museums, and public officea-have beome doubly resplendent with epaulettes and plumes, sabre, and spur, for the approaching iubilee of the Prince of Pruasia haa not only introduced the greatest activity among the garrison of the place, but also brought up to the capital the moat distngumihed officers of rank from all parts of thei country. All arms, all ranks, ad almost all countrie seeGm to be represented among them. Englald, Auztia, and RusBia, infantry, cavalry, andartillery,viewitheach other in their various hues of scarlet, blue, green, and white. The shortest way for your readers to attain an idea of the multifarious military just now repreaentedhere, chieflyby their officer, be to peruse the following atte inpt at an enumeration in advance of th,e ceremonies that are to take place to-morrow, which will be the 50th anniversary of the Prince's entering the army. At S o'clock in the morning all the bans of the different regiments of the Guard Wi asemble at the Zeughaus, nearly opposite the Prince's Palace, in their best parade uniform, and proceed thence to give the Prince a morning concert. Sensibly enough, the men are not left on these Occasion5 to shiver in the cold ont3ide while playing, and perform involuntary shakes on their various instrunents, but are admitted into some large apartment of the palace; bat the effect that 'will be produced by a hundred or twFo wind instruments, chiefly horns, in a confined space is one that the reader wrould, doubtless, rather imagine than experience. It is characteristic of this Royal family, and country that the first ceremony of the day will be theKirchgang; the whole family, andprobably the high Mlinisters of State also, wi1l repair to the Don7, or cathedral, and return thanks for the preservation of the Prince duzing so long a military career, and doubtless some forn of blessing will be bestowed on him by the officiating clergy. It is the same with a couple that have lived together for 50 years in the bonds of wedlock; they also repair to chuirch on the 50th anniversary of their wedding-day, and the feativities of this their "golden wedding" commence with a blessing from the parish minister. The first act after the return from church will probably be the "grahdatH.77m-cour," or the offering of congratulations by the Royal family and the Prince's household, after -which the presentation of the various deputations and offerings will con- I mence. The King will, in his own name, present his brother with a highly ornamented sword. As the chief officer of the entire army, he will then, at the head of a numerous deputation of all arms, present to the Prince the silver shield which the officers of the army offer him as a token of their devotion. TheLandwehr will then beg hisRoyalEighness's acceptance of a golden helnet,which theirjomt contributions have provided as the expression of their collective attachment and respect. The 3d Regiment of Russian Musketeers and the 34th Regiment of Austrian Infantry, of both which the Prince is chef, wit l present their congratulations by deputation. Sir Coln Campbell, who arrived here yesterday with several officers of various arms in his suite, will present his Royal Highness with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the name of our Queen Victoria; it is felt to be an unmistakeable mark of regard and respect for the Prince that our Queen should have chosen for this mission so distinguished a veteran Other military deputations will be headed by the Commandant of Coblentz, the residence of the Prince as Governor of the Rhenish provinces; the ViceGovernor of the Federal fortress of Mayence, with the General, the commandant, and the other Austrian offlicers of the garrison; others will be sent by the garrison of Memel, where the Prince entered the army, now 50 years ago, then a boy of nine years old; from the Russian army, from the Austrian army, and from the military forces of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Deputations of civilians will be formed by the House of Notables, the House of Deputies, the municipality of Berlin, the commercial classes, who will present a silver ornament in the form of a column; the province of Pomerania, of which the Prince is Stadtholder; and doubtless many others of which I know knothing. The surplus from the contributions of the Landwehr, which is left after defraying the expense of the golden helmet, is to be put at the disposition of the Prince, who, it is believed, will award it to the funds of the society for providing dwellings for the working classes; and another subscription has been raisedto the amount of 12,000 thalers to found a special fund for the support of invalid veterans, and to be called after the Prince. To our countrymen, between whose eyes and the MIouarch all sorts of constitutional fictions interpose an impervious veil, all these ceremonies will appear an unnecessary fuss about an ordinary amily anniversary; but in Prussia, where the Royal family has been identified with the people and nation by deep sorrow and distress, as well as by victory and glory, it is othervise. The army, too, in Prussia is the body on which the whole State rests for protection at home and preservation from a recurrence of the evils of 1806-13. The Royal family and the army are the nervous and muscular system of Prssia, to which the delicately articulated and intricate vertebrm of I the civil bureaucracy furnish the backbone. A double festival, then, in which these twvo most prominent elements of the Prussiana polity are made the object of a rare ovation is one that unites all classes and parties in the kingdom, with the exception of those malcontents who see in the firm union of the military and monarchical principle the greatest obstAcle to the destruction of order. The peculiar military organization that Prussia adopted in the dark days of her adversity, though well calculated to preserve her from any recurrence of such extreme misfortune as succeeded Jena, is not of a nature to favour aggressive war, the war of anibition, or Cabinet policy; and therefore the recent history of Prussia has admitted of no bright moments of military success to relieve the monotony of a conscientious discharge of militaty duties in times of peace. In later years the only occasion in which the Prince of Prussia has had an opportunity of acting as commander of an army in active service in the field was in the suppression of the insurrection in Baden in 1849, but in the earlier period of his military career he distinguished himself by personal bravery in 1813, at the battle of Leipsic and elsewhere. As wvith the Prince individually so it is with the army collectively-its brightest anniversaries are not to be dated from recent events. It remains to be seen whether tie year 1857 will alter or add anything to the annals of the military history of Prussia; 1807, 1757, 1707, 1657, have been already engraven in the hearts and memories of all patriots; unfortunately the present cause at issue is not one to produce any great enthusiasm or to tbrow a factitious halo over any achievements. The year 1807, when the Court was cooped up at Kl6nigsberg and the Royal family was fain to inhabit an inconvenient cottage " aif den Hufen," and the young Friedrich Wilhelm first entered the army, was signalized by the battle of Eylau, which the Prussians equally with the French reckon among their victories-the first victory that Prussia could boast of since the defeat of Jena. 1757 boasts of the battles of Prague, Rossbach, and Leuthen, thelast two of which more than wiped out the defeat at Kolin which the Prussians suffered under Frederick the Great. The year preceding 1707 was rendered illustrious by the battle of Ramilies, where the Prussians, under Lottum, vied with the English, under Marlborough, in the successful struggle for the victory,while the relief of Turin bythePrussians, under Duke Leopold, of Dessau, signalized the year iteelf. The treaty of Welau, the result of the victorious campaigns of the Great Elector, Friedrich Wilhelm, against the power of the Swedes, from whom the northern provinces of the present kingdom of Prussia were wrung, marks the year 1657. The Prince and Princess of Prussia and Prince Friedrich Wilhelm arrived here yesterday evening, tobeready for the festivalof to-morrow. Very shortly after the commencement of the new year the young Prince will repair to Breslau, where he is to take the command of the 1Ith Regiment of Foot. After the ceremony of to-morrow the King will give a state dinner to the Royal family ana the more distinguished members of the deputations, to the number of 700, and on the following day the Prince will entertain a party of 400 guests. SWITZERLAD. The following is the speech of Ii!. Dules, the President of the Council of States, at the opening of the extraordinary session of the Federal Assembly:- " Gentlemen,-The Federal Assembly, convoked extraordinarily by the Federal Council, will have to enter into serious discussions. Our country, the maost peaceable in Europe, is menaced with war by a foreign Power. Onght we to elude this war or accept it? Suec is the difficult question which the councils of the nation wll have to de. cide. I believe that I express your sentiments and those of the Swiss people in saying that Switzerland desires peace with all her heart, if it be compatible with honour, for Switzerland has neither an obstinate and exagprated opinion of her rights, nor a sentiment of vengeance splnst the unhappy prisoners. But, if peace be not compatible with honour, Switzerland would a thousand times prefer war, with all the evils it caries with it, to a peace which would be a stain on the honour and independence of the oountry. It is with that spirit that we shall commence our deibertions-one hand extended to accept I peaw, and the other ready to mupport war. May the GOd of our fMthers, who has hitherto so mariellously conducted Switzerland through dangers, be also with s in these cir- I CmutanCeS I T now declare the extraordiny ession of the Cotucil of States to be opened," The Suisse of Berne says "The Federal MlWitay Departmett hba ardeesed to the Government of the ontos a clralar ia which it wjoiu i the Municipal authorities to send immediately to the con. Imndens of divisions a return of the *stte of the buildings, the conditinn of the popuhtion, &c., of their communes, together with information pecapting al the edifioe6 which can serve for the establishment of gurrdhouses, workshops, hospitals, and stables. The communes, moreover, ae requested to nako known the number of horse" they possess If war be doeared the General-in-Chief aud the comnanders of divisions will hbve the right to take from private persons all the horses they may requie The Grand Conncil or I Lucerne met on Saturday, and granted to the Gorernment nunlimited credit for the eventualitiee of wLr!" The Bourse Gazate of Berlin announces that the last news fronm Berne leaves no more chance of a pacific solutione Aocording to this journal, a suspicion is entertained at Berlin that the Federal Council wishes to protract the negotiations until the period when, the trial being finished and the sentence delivered, all paths of conciliation will be definitively closed according to the weU-known resolutions of the Kng of Prussia. A letter from Berlin in the Dresden Journm Fays:- " Immense activity prevais in the varions offices of the Ministrr of War here, and of the administrations of the regiments. In the Ministry of War and in the general staff deliberations, in which the offioers of provincial staff take part, are held on the preparations necessary to be made for the entrance on a campaign of an expeditionary nary. The medical organization in particular is being completely transformed, in consequence of the experience obtained in the Eastern war.' The following private telegraphic despatch ha5 beeI received ' BERLIN, Dsc 30, Ei-s\mG. " In the sitting of the National Assembly at Berne the Commissdon proposed unanimously to accept thO propositions of the Federal Council, and consequently to remain faithful to the policy acted on up to this time. The reporter, L. Escheer, said, It is usele to give a motive for these prepositions, as they depend on the general law of nations. Nevertheless, the omnmunications of the Federal Council increase the hopes of a pacific solution satisfactory to Switzerland. The Committee hopes that the Federal Couneil will have sucooeded in finding thtt solution. in the event of a oontrary result, an energetic defeneo of the territory wil be ?rovided for, for which an authorization of unlimited credit is demanded.' The conclusions of tbe Committee were adopted unnimouscly, withoutdiscussion, by the 120 members present. The effect of the report was prodigious."

Thus tie Ministry at Lisbon will for a time hold itself less dependent upon foreign capitalists; but it is believed much larger loans must be ultimately raised if railway constructions are to be carried on upon an useful scale. Letters from Gibraltar inform us that on tbe 25th and 26th of December a very heavy gale was experienced from the westward. Fivo vessels were driven on shoro-two near the Ragged Staff, and three on the neutral ground. No lives 'were lost. Several vessels parted from their anchors during the gale.

TiE DOUBLE MURDXA rX WEtYGrOy. The inquest uponL the bodiesf of Edwin. FulttBacot, aged two years and a-half, and Sarah Ann Bacon, an infant 11 3months' old, who wero found mnurdered at the hou9e of Itheir parents in Four Acre-street, Newington, lst Tuesday inrnng WAs held yesterday afternoon at the Beehive rterE ont,befre Mr. W. Carter, coroner for R-r::~ diisio ofSurrey. It will be recollected that the mother of the childron. in company with ber aunt, went to the station in Kennington. lane anv gave information to the polioe, telling a strange story of a man having come into her house in the night and committed the murder. Sinoe her confinement in Horsemonger-lane Gaol she pertinaciously persists in this stato. ment, but it will be soen by the evidence below that she has oznly recently boen discharged from St. Luke's Asylunn, and her condition was such that when her husband went out of town toRigate to workherfriendsthoughtitnocessrythat someone should be with her. A niece of hers was accordingly sent thero by her aunt, m PFayne, on Monday night, but could not obtain admittance, This somewhat alarmed her aunt, and next morning, accompanied by her daughter, she went to the house, when the murder was discovered. The father of the children was at otne communicated with, and arrived in London on Wednesday. Tho poor man, on hearing that his children wemr murdered and his wife in custody, was overwhelmned with grief and fainted aray. His aplaranco at the inquest yesterday occasioned much oe jury having been sworn, proceeded to view the bodties, whch presented a piteous spectacle, their throats ing Cut from er to ear. On the return of the coroner and jurymen into court the following evidence was ta_en The first witness examined was Hanriet Payne, a;ot of Marta Bacon, the mother of the children who is now in cutody, charged withthe murder. She 4eposed that on ay morning last she went frm her residence, Bethnalgreen, to cal upon Martha BaCon, hut when she had atrrived within a couple of hundrod yards of her houze, in Four Acrestreet, she met her in the str-et. Witnei asked her where she had been all night, whoen sho repliod that she had been in her own house, and that in the night a man had some through the window and cut her throat and the throats of her two children. At the same time she removed tho shawl she wore from her neck, And xhowed witness the mark of a slight cut, extending haf round the neck. She also showed her several other cuts. Witness was much excited and said, "Oh dear; let us go back to the house at once." Martha Bacon, accompanied b witness and her daughter a young wonan, returned to the house. hm Bacon opened toe door. On entering the house she saw, just inside the room, the dear little child Edward Fuller stting in a chair with his little wood table before him and his little head lying fac downwLrds on it. Witness did not see him move, bat a stream of blood was flowing on the floor close to the chair. Witness said, " Oh dear Ohi dear! What haVe YOU done here 7" At that time Mrs. Bacon was standing close to her; she made no reply at that momenat, but shortly afterwards she said, " The baby, too, is murdered upstairs, and is quite ead." Witness di not go upstairs, but went out of the house, saying that she must seek a polceman. Her ughter and Mrs. Bxcon went out with her. Hlaving even information of what she had seen to the constable on duty at e sttionhouso in Kennington-lane, she returned in company with the policeman to the house. In the back room upstairs they saw the other child, Sarah Ann, a baby eleven months old, Iying on the floor, a little distance from the cot. She lay on her back quite dead, with her throat cut. There was blood on her bedgown and on tlho floor. There was a bed in the room, which appeared to have been lain in by thelittle boy, but there was anoblood in it. Martha Bacon was tbere when they found the baby. Witness saked Mrs. Bacon how it occurred, and when it occurred, and she replied "8 o'clock," but did not say whether it ws at night or -orning. They then returned to the police-station, where the wound on the throat of Martha Bacon was wasbed and dressed by tho surgoon. In the course of that operation sh again repeated that she did not do it, but that a man came into the window and kIlled the children. She was detained at the station. In reply to a question from the jury witness said that she was induced to go to the house because, on the previous evening, he daughter called there and could not get in, and witness was appreensive that something was rrong, as Mrs. Bacon h not been quite right in her mind. By the Coroner.-She had been rather occentric-rather flighty. She had recently com e fromn St. Luke's Asylum, and witness was apprehensive about her, but did not think that she would do any harm to anyone. She was very fond hHatrrtiet unro, daughter of the last witness, corroborated Police-constable:Cooke, 75 L, stated that he vas on duty Iat the Kennington-lane police-station on Tuesday morning last at half-past 1 o'clock, when rIs. Payne, the first witness, called in company Lwith Martha Bacon, and requested a policeman to go to Four Acre-street, Lorrimore-road,Walrorth, stating that something very serious h d happened there. He went with the women and was admitted by the prisoner. On the road there Mrs, Payne told him that some one had cutthe children's throats, uaon which the prisoner imwnediately said, `I did not do It.' Tho witness, hbving describedtthe findingof the bodies in the position mentioned by Mrs. Payne, stated that, after ascertaining that both children were quite dead, he said, 'Dear me, this is a bad job indeed;" upon which the prisoner again said, "It ws not done by me." On earching the room ho found a woman's nightdress on the bed saturated with blood. Witness locked the door of the room, and, taking possession of all the keys, took the two wou;en to the rtatiou-hous The fist time that he heard anything about the prisoner's throat being cut was on their return to the station-house,when Mr. Bushell, a surgeon, was sent for and attended to the wound. After it was dressed witness went, accompanied by Mr. Bushell, again to the house, to look for the instrument with which the wounds h ad been inflicted. The witness here producod the knife with which it is supposed the murders were committed. It wvas common black-handled tablo-knife, which was found lying on the table near the body of the little boy. Itwascovered Mith blood, and on exminhiing it it was evident that it had been recently sharpened on a steel. The houso was sprinkled with blood in various directions. There were spots of blood upon the stairs and a nantity on the landing, Some of the stains of blood about the ouse appeared to have been caused by the brushing of a garment saturated wVth blood. On examining the honse externally he found all the windows secure, and no marks of blood on any of the sashes or the sills, There were no footprints on the soil at the back of the house, nor any appearance of a person having either made an entrance or an egress at any of the windows. No one could have got into the back window without leaving some traces. That window was about four feet from the ground. Having regard to the nattre of tbe wounds on the throats of the children and that of the woman, ,witness was of opinion that no one could have made them without their hands being bloody. There was a bloody azron in the room. 'Witness took the mother of the chlren into custody on suspicion of having committed the murders herself. She appeared rather delirious, und had a wandering look with her. He abstained from asking her any questions, seeing tho state she was in. In his opuinon, no ono else committed the injuries. The boy appeared to have had his throat cut while he was sitting in his chair. Mr. Bushel, surgeon, of Lower Kennington-lane, deposed that about 2 o'clock he was sent for to look at the throat of the prisoner, upon which he found a wound. Oa asking her how she was sho said she was very poorly, and told umr the same story about a man coming through the window and cutting her throat and the throats of her twvo children which she had told to the policeman. He rermarked on examining her that the wound had been made icme time, when she replied, " Yes, ever since 8 o'clock last night." lie found the incised wound on the neck extending a good way round, the dee xart of which was about the 16th part of an inch. te aso found a great number of smaller cuts, varying from two to four inches, which crossed each other and presented a jagged appearanco. It appeared as if she had made several different attempts to cut her throat and had failed. The wounds were ail of such a nature that she could bhve infdicted them herself. They might have been inflicted by another, but he thought it was hardly possible, because in order to enable them to be inflicted by another, she must have remained perfectly passive. Hler left hand was bloody. Witness then proceeded to the house in company with the police, and examined the bodies of the two children. He found their throets cut with a sharp instrument, and with such force that the carotid artery, the jugular vein, the windpipe and all the arteri-s were completely severed. The knife produced was such an instrument as might have been used in inflicting the wounds. It has the appearance of blood upon it now, and looked as if it had been wiped from the handle towards the top of the blade. The witness accounted for the circumstance of blood being sprinkled about the house by the supposition that it flowed from the wrounds she had inflicted upon herself. There was blood and water in the room, as if bloody hands had been washed without soap. The bodies were qmntocold, and they appeared to have been dead pwards et 20 hours when he saw them. When he was called upon to attend Mrs. Bacon he found her with that wild, vacant stare of the eyes which betoken, insanity, and appeared utterly in- diferent to everything that was going on around her.

BOSWlrBLL',6 LE'Ti'EXS.Y The rescue of the manu-cript fromi the pat of butter in the Seit unenltu Jmer,L(yi fronm the gunwadding of the Mao of Feelingj, and a hundred similar fictions of authorship, have been paralleled, as we are asked to believe, by the actnal inciclentsto which we owe this volume of letters by Boswell. According to the story related in the Dref hee, a few years ago a clergyman whose niale is not given, having occasion to buy sonie small articles at the shop of Madame Noel, at Boulogne, obierved that the paper in which they were wrapped was the fragment of an English letter. lpp n inspection, a date and some names were discovered; andt further investigation proved that the piece of papi r iu question was part of a correspondence carried on nearly a century before between the biograph..r of Dr. Johnson and his early friend, the Rev. William Johnson Temple. A still further inquiry ascertained that this piece of paper had been taken from a large parcel recently purchased from a hawker who was in the hatbit of passing through 13oulogne one or twice a-year for the purpose of supplying the different shops wvith paper, but faeyond this no information could be obtained. The whole contents of the parcel wvere inmmdiately secured, and it was found that the majority of the letters bore the London and Devon poatniarks, and were franked by contemporary and well-known signatures. Besides those of Boswell there were several other letters from persons of lhis time, together with a few unfinished sermons andl essays by Temple himuself. At the death of the namneless purchaser of these letters they passed into the hands of his nephew, who is nameless also, and froum wlhom the present nameless editor subsequienitly o.btained them. It does not appear that any one of known authority and experience in such documuents has bad an opportunity of examining them, and of deposing to their genuineness; but they are put before the public with this cursory intimation, which has all the characteristics of a pure fabrication, and the public is expected to receive them without hesitation, on account of the internal proofs of their authenticity. Thus far, however, so inconsequent is the upshot of an incredible story, not a doubt has been raised, not a suspicion has been hinted, for these proofs are so calculated to convince everybody that could we conceive the letters to have been forged the forgery would exceed in skill anything on record. After perusing them ourselves we are certainly not prepared to utter an exception to the general verdict, for, though we demur to the vagueness of their history, we are ready to receive them as genuine, on the ground that the contrary hypothesis is simply incredible. Boswell is apparently to be identified in every line. His friendly, fussy, obliging, and suiceptible nature is exhibited side by side with his vanity and self-complacency in ali that familiar excess of candour which lays open his equivocal motives, his waverings, and humiliations. Time, place, and circurnstance indifferently concur to satisfy us further that Boswell is before us, and even the details we shall extract from these letters mav snffice to impart our convictions to the most incredulous of our readers. The letters extend over a space of nearly 40 years, from 1758 to 1795, the sum of Boswell's existence after emerging from the state of boyhood. The earliest are written when he is but 18, and the latest when, at the age of 55, he lies unconscious of his danger on the bed of death. As we unravel their warp and woof we find that Boswell had his share of unhappiness, and that his self- complacency was more than compensated by the penalties he paid for his imprudences. As he himself said in his Tee,' to thc Hebrides, " he had all Dr. Johnson's principles, withl somnc degree of relacation," and the relaxation, in addition to his unique vanity and love of notoriety, unhappily included three passions which are the chief elements of mortal peril. Boswell was slightly fond of play, he was excessively and foolishly fond of women, and he was hopelessly fond of his great enemy, the bottle. The distinct mention of these several failings, associated with his otherwise amiab>e disposition, wil enable us to take these letters as they come, and to illustrate at random either of his characteristics. They were early days when he intimated to his correspondent, Temple, his passion for a Miss W -t, who is "just such a young lady as I could wish for the partner of niy soul," and alnost as early we perceive that he had indicated his talent for biographical journalism by travelling with Sir David Dalrymple, and taking notes of his conversation. About the same time he has general desires of " getting into the Guards, being about Court, enjoying the happiness of the bean mmizde and the company of men of genius,-in short, everything that he could wish." Yet, as a set off to these lively tendencies, in the very next letter he introduces us thus early to that constitutional melancholy for 'which he was so solicitous that his friends should pity him, and by which he brought down upon him the condeniation of his I great Mentor. Shortly afterwards he is able to comfort himself with Hasrris on Happiecess, and he rises from its perusal " happier" himself, and for a season, as he congratulates himself, " more disposed to follow virtue." In the year 1763, being in London, and occupying Temple's chambers during his friend's absence at Cambridge, he has made his great coup of an introduction to Johnson. "I had," he says, further, "the honour of supping t9te-d-t6te with Mr. Johnson last night. . . .. We sat till between 2 and 3 o'clock. He took me by the hand and said, 'My dear Boswell, I love you very much.' Now, Temple, can I help indulging vanity ?" Yet, even while this intercourse had the infiuence of novelty Boswell's morals were not much advantaged, and he was " following virtue" at a very respectful distance. He let himself down, to his remorse, before Temple's younger brother Bob, meaning, as we infer, that they got drunk together, and that Boswellhimself was the drunker of the two. But "in the meantime," he says, pulling himself up, "lot me endeavour to acquire steadiness and constant propriety of conduct." Shortly after this ambigtuouis spin, the amiable side of the teetotum comes distinctly uppermost. He is finding stray guiineas for Bob, and offering money to Temple himself, while he takes from his superior moral elevation a patronizing view of the character of his younger friend. " I am reallyveryuneasyon your brother's account," he says to Temple. " I am afraid his principles of virtue are not firmly fixed. . . Do what you can to establish him in solid notions of religion and morality. M My dear friend, I wish these hints may be of use; you know they come from a sincere friend when they come from James Boswell." Boswell is next seen preparing for his departure to Utrechlt as the commencement of his foreign tour, and, as he has nientioned in the biography, Dr. Johnson is now described in one of his letters to Temple (3d of August, 1763) as coming to Harwich to see him off. Froom this date there are no more letters to Temple till 1766, including the interVal during which Boswell remained abroad. Under 1764, however, we have letters to Mr. iVlitchell, which disclose Boswell's life-long difficulties with his father, the Lord of Auchinleck. Boswell endeavoured to propitiate the old gentleman by controlling his foibles, and to solace hinself by sacrificing as few of theni as possible. " I mary endeavour to make him happy, and at the same time not be too hard upon myself (he says) . . . . One tihiDg I am sure of, and by the undisguised honour of a man of probity I swear shall chiefly influence u'e-a regard to tho happiness of him to whom I owve so much. Belieee me, I hav'e a so0l." He is solicitous that MIitchell, who was our Envoy at the Court of Prussia, should do something for one of his friends, and "if you can aid me, you will most truly oblige a worthy fellow, fin such I am." Beas-el skl,aks with as little reticence as Jean Jaicques Rousseau, and, as for the most part he thinks complacently of himself and his exploits, his thinkin,gs aloud are as droll as they can be. Trenty years after be had written to Johnson describing the course of his tour, he characterized his own letter as "full of generous enthusiasm." He was given thus to attitudinize and practise at an imaginary mirror, with a consciousness of his perfections, and yet (so far do we consider Mr. Carlyle to be right in attributing to him a genuine love of excellence in others) we find him easily diverted to its exclusive contemplation, and scmetimes so absorbed that he loses sight of himself entirely. With Paoli, on whom he 4uartered himself, as with the Doetor, his "timiiity soon wore off; I no longer thought of myself ;" but, as we know fromhis COrwican Tom', either his Corsican dress, the deference of the peasantry, eveii his chocolate on a silver salver, or any incidenit, however shgiht, suffiedc to recall hirm as easily to that pleasing sub- ject of contemplation, the noble sentiments and the graces of that " worthy fellow " James Boswell. He is ludicrously prone also to volunteer his sage counsels. In 1767, when we find him at Edinburgh, he is proflering to his friend Temple, who has now become a clergyman, canonical advice in the style of an archbishop. "My friend, it is your office to labour cheerfully in the vineyard, and, if possible, to leave not a tare in Mamehad." . . . " In a word, my dear Temple, be a good clergyman, and you will be happy both here and hereafter." Yet, in proof of his title to utter these injunctions, in the same letter he entertains his correspondent with an account of a "dear infidel," "Iny amiable mistress," -who "is no longer bound to him who was her husband." The latter, we presume, is one of the tares of the vineyard, for "he has used her shockingly ill, he has deserted her, he lives with another," and therefore "is she not free," and, as the context implies, the fair prize of the worthy James Boswell? His letter, which runs on from day to day like a journal, mentions his diflicilties respecting this lady on the score of expense and a slightly uneasy conscience. "Furnishing a house, and maintaining her with a maid, wil cost me a great deal of money, and it is too like marriage or too much a settled plan of licentiousness; but what can I do? I have already taken the house, and the lady has agreed to go in at Whitsuntide; I cannot in honour go back." He is conscious that " this is a curious epistle to a clergyman ;" but, nevertheless, among further talk about Paoli, David Hume, and Rousseau, he proceeds with the details of his little difficulty as follows:- "1 What is to be thought of this life, my friend? Hear the story of my last three days. After tormeating myself with reflecting on miy charmer's former loves, and ruminating on parting with her, I wens to ber. I could not conceal my being distressed. I told her I was very unhappy, but I would not tell her why. She took this very seriously, and was so much affected that she went next morning and gave up her house. I went in the afternoon and secured the house, and then drank tea with her. She was much agitated; she said she was determined to go and board herself in the north of England, and that I used her very ill. I expostulated with her ; I was sometimes resolved to let her go, and sometimes my heart was like to burst within me. I held her dear band; her eyes were full of passion; I took her in my arms; I told herwhat made me miserable - she was pleased to find it was nothing worse. She had imagined that I was suspicious of her fidelity, and she thought that very ungenerous in reconsidering her behaviour. She said I should not mind her faults before I knew her, since her conduct was now most circumspect. We renewed our fondness. She owned she loved me more than she had ever done her husband. All was again welL She said she did not reproach me with my former follies, and we should be on an equal footing. My mind all at once felt a spring; I embraced her with transport." [The letter then proceeds to say that the same evening he supped with some friends, became intoxicated, and committed gross follies, which the next day he went and confessed to his charmer in terms which he thinks eloquent.] " How like you the eloquence of a young barrister ? It was truly the eloquence of love. She bid me rise ; she took me by the hand; she said she forgave me; she kissed me; she gently upbraided me for entertaining any unfavourable idea of her;* she bid me take great care of myself, and in time coming never drink upon any account. Own to me, Temple, that this was noble; and all the time her beauty enchanted me more than ever: may I not then be hers ?" Within a month of the above he is natlrally enough writing to Temple again, "What a snare have I escaped ! Do you remember Ulysses and Circe?" Bosawell being, in his own contemplation, the representative of the sagacious Ithacan. "' Sub domina meretrice vixisset turpis et excors.' "My life is one of the most romantic that I believe either you or I really know of, and yet I am a very sensille, good sort of man." He is, however, emancipated from his charmer by this time, though he protests that Temple uses her cruelly in calling her "the unnatural mother of three children." He confesses that she ought for the sake of her children " to conform to the strict ideas of the world." But then " how strangely do we colour our own vices !" I, James Boswell, even "II startle when you talk of keeping another man's wife, yet that was literally my scheme." However, Iam now escaped from Circe, and "what say youto my marrying ?" Whereupon he describes a young lady in the neighbouirhood of Auchinleck, who has 2001. or 3001. a-year, piety, and fair features, and who is very well regarded by his fathez and family. At the close of this testimony to his rapid vacillations he mentions, by the way, his brother David with the benevolence of a stable and superior being. " I enclose you a letter from him; you will see the 'yougJ mast as he is in it. He has a portion of that sensibility which rendered you and me unhappy every moment tiUl time and experience taught us commonsense and moderate desires." After a letter in which, having introduced himself to Lord Chatham as the friend of Paoli, he coolly asks Jupiter Tonans for the honour of a letter "now and then," we find him again referring to the lady in his neighbourhood as "the finest woman I have ever seen." She had paid a visit to Auchinleck, had stayed there four days, "and in our romantic groves I adored her like a divinity." Her picture would be an ornament to the gallery at Auchinleck, and " her children would be all Boswells and Temples, and as fine women as these are excellent men." Notwithstanding these anticipations we hear a little further on of a certain "Italian angel," who has at least the merit of being " constant." " I had a letter from her," he says, " a few days ago which made me cry." But Bozzy is now for "real life and solid happiness," and anxious for an engagement to fix his mind in women as the law has in employment. In respect of law, about this date he was endeavouring to tack himself on to the famous " Douglas cause," out of which, as the readers of the Life of Johnwon will remember, he contrived to extract his usual share of personal humiliation by his pushing attenmpts to obtain notice at any sacrifice. To some information on this subject conveyed to Temple succeeds another letter, in which his correspondent iS informed that his present frame of mind is so far fixed and satisfactory as regards the lady that, like Lord Mountcoffeehouse, he became " quite intoxicated on Tuesday last drinking Miss Blair's health (for that is the name of my angelic princess)." But he adds, " I am abashed and determined to keep the strictest watch over my passions," and he then proposes to Temple a sort of embassy in his behalf, of which the detailed instructions follow in another letter. Temple is to visit the lady and to speak in Boawell's praise, also to make a report to that ardent suitor of his princess's merits, " to be a man of as much ease as possible," yet " to take notes," as, "perhaps, you now fix me for life." Some of the instructions extend to this length:- "Praise me for my good qualities,-you know othe ; but talk also how odd, how inconstant, how impetuous, how much accustomed to women of intrigue. Ask gravely, pray don't you imagine there is sometbing of madness in that family? Talk of my various travels,-German princes, -Voltaire and Rousseau. Talk of my father ; my strong desire to have my own house. Observe her well. See how amiable! Judge if she would be happy with your friend. Think of me as the great man at Adamtown,quite classical, too! Study the mother. ltemember well what passes. Stay tea." In the next letter we hear of a rival, the discovery of whom, in the person of a certain nabob, has cooled BoswelPs ardour, although in his inamorata he still declares that " every flower is united." Shortly afterwards he explains to Temple his difficulties with his father, in a passage which is too characteristic to be missed: " How unaccountable is it that my father and I should be so ill together! He is a man of sense and a man of worth; but from someunhappy turn in his disposition he is much dissatisfied with a son whom you know. "I write to him with warmtb, cith an honest trie, wishing that he would think of me as I am ; but myetters shock him, ansI every expression in them is interpreted unfavourably. To give you an instance, I send you a letter I had from im a few days ago. How galing is it to the friend of Paoli to be treated so! I have answered him in my own style : I will be myself. I have said, ' Why think so strangely of my expression of being Prinmus Mantu,, ? Suppose I were married to hMis Blair, would I not be Ptimtus Mfantsu at Adamtown? and why not? Would I you not be pleased to see your son happy in independence, cultivating his little farm and ornamenting his nuptial villa, and filling himself one day, as well as possible, the place of a much reater man?' " Temaple, wud you not like sucl a son? Would you not fed a gto, of parenztal joy 1 I know you would; and yet my worthy father writes to me in the manner you see, with that Seots strength of sarcasm which is peculiar to a North Briton. But he in offended with that fire which you and I cherish as the essence of our souls; and owcan I makehim happy ? Am I bound to do so at the expense, not of this or the other agreeable wish, but at the expense of myself? The time was when such a letter from my father as the one I enclose would have depressed; but I am now firm, and, as my revered friend, Mtr. Samluel Johnson, used to say, I feel the privileges ofan independent human being; however it is hard that I cannot have the pious satisfaction of being well wiith my father." At the same time he is not getting on with his princess, to whom he writes tbree letters without receiving an answer. For ten days, he declares, he was in a fever; but at last he broke the enchantment, and he then wrote his fair one " a strange Sultanish letter," and did not go to see ber for three weeks, After that he obtained an interview, but the lady justified herself, and Boswell did not succeed in - Ltters of .James BotidZl addreScd to thc RCv. W. J. TemPle.-Now first published from the original hIS., &a. Bentley, 1857. making up their quarrel. He despatches her thereupon another letter, of which he sends Temple a copy, observing, " Cl,dd ti,5 pi wid Bswzell say more than you wil see thtere?" In the evening he got her answer, the substance of which is that, "Temple, she is cunning, and sees my weakness." From this moment he resolves to tbink no more of her. "After this I shaU be upon my guard against ever indulging the least fondness for a Scots lass; I am a soul of a more southern frame. I may, perhaps, be fortunate enough to find an Englishwoman who will be sensible of my merit, and wiU study to please my singular humour." The following day he has read the princess's letter again and the whole aspect of her conduct is changed.' " love her," he says, " Temple, with my whole heart. I am entirely in her power." He accompanies her to a performance of Othello, in Edinburgh, and squeezes h er waist when " th e jeal'ous Mloor described his very soul." Still the prmncess is distant, and when he makes his proposal the dialogue which ensues, and which is detailed toTemple in the style of Boswell's Johnson, amounts only to this, that she liked his estate better than she li-ed himself. After that he relaxes his ardour in the chase, as the " proud Boswell" well might. At the same time he, perhaps, gives us a clue to the cause of the princess's dusinclination to accept him in the confession to Temple that " amid all this love I have been as wiild as ever. . . . . Trust me in time coming; I give you my word of honour, Temple, I have nothing else to save me." Some time before this, as we infer, he had made " a vow beneath the soleni yew" at Mamhead that he would reform his looser courses. But this vow had apparently been broken, and he -was still fixing some prospective period for his perfection. He had recently resolved that it should be as soon as his account of Corsica was published. "II shall then have a character which I must support, &c. - - - One great fautlt of mine is talking at random; I will guard against it." But his contemporaries and posterity had little to fear on this score. It was not fated that he should keep a desperate resolve which would have deprived them of other and excellent entertainment. (To be continued.)
BOBBERIES WFITH PERSONAL VIOLENCE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It may be of some service to the community at large to be told how garotte robberies are usually perpetrated, and how best prevented. The robbers work in a gang, which consists generally of three persons. The taUest and most muscular comes behind the intended victim, and, rapidly throwing his arm around the neck, presses the throat almost to strangulation. The others rifle the pockets and otherwise assist. The best way to foil the attack is to press down the chin to the chest at the first perception of danger as rapidly and as firmly as possible, so as to allow the lungs fuU play, and then to make good use of them, men and women alike screaming lustily. At a good shout the robbers will ran, and all the faster if the following sugges tions be acted on, when the attacked should turn pursuer and assist in the capture. How to put down aU robberies attended with personal violence is a more important matter. I. Let the judges sentence every gaxotter, burglar, and other robber who uses any sort of violence upon the person, to perpetual imiprisonment. The late Serjeant Adams put down a crime which was beginning to be very rife six or seven years ago (extorting money by threats of infamous accusations) by sentencing three or four of the perpetrators to transportation for life. These vile men came under my own charge, and I never saw convicts so utterly astonished and horrified at their sentence, Their confederates immediately took to other schemes of viUany less hazardous. 2. Let all attempts at murder, whether successful or not, be treated alike with the penalty of death; and to this awful category of offences let al robberies be added which result in the death of the plundered, or of persons protecting the property and persons of others, although murder may not have been originally contemplated. Further, let every known rogue, upon whose person shall be found a life-preserver or other dangerous weapon, or instrument of thieving, be summarily flogged, and have three months' solitary confinement. 3. Let there be a prison for perpetual imprisonment establUshed of very formidable character, to which the worst offenders shaU be consigned. Whether at home or abrcid makes no matter; in my opinion (the expense in the latt, r case will be at least fourfold, and the management worse). It is the life character of the sentence and the hopeless ness of escape which strike terror into the soul of the thief. These measures, if promptly carried out, would very quickly cause fierce and bratal robberies to abate by putting out of the way of doing mischief many of the worst sort of villains, and by terrifying the rest, and bring down thieving to mere feats of ingenuity and cunning just enough to keep people awake on the subject of public morals and the security of their property. Having said thus much on the score of public safety and the expediency of exemplary severity in order to deter from crime, may I now be permitted to add a word or two on the side of humanity, and in behalf of a pitiable class of persons who are likely to suffer intensely from the just, but too indiscriminate, indignation of the public, which has been evoked by the incorrigible wickedness of some of their number ? Contrary to general opinion, it is certain that the great majority of criminal prisoners in England do not return after release to a course of crime; reformed or not I will not affinn-31 per cent. only at the outside return to prison. Of convicts released a still larger majority forsake the ways of crime (although the minority are much more dangerous). Up to the last return, March 11, 185, from the passing of the act of 1853, the known failures (for two and a-half years) were only eight per cent. The return, if completed to the present time, will probably reach 15 per cent. I am perfectly satisfied, however, as to the fact of the comparison being in favour of the convict class. The difference I ascribe not to the superior discipline in the Government prisons merely, but; in a great degree to the fact that convicts being incarcerated for so much longer time lose the associations and advantages for thieving more than prisoners in general, and advance also in years far beyond the ago which qualifies best for success in the art. This is contrary in some measure to the experience of the former member of my congregation " in the Model Prison," whose letter you admitted on the subject on December 30. My old friend I perceive puts down the number who live by crime and rapine at 40 per cent. Well, be it so. All I ask is that society, in the exercise of its undoubted right to extirpate crime and get rid of its dangerous subjects, will not confound the bad and good, and consign aU alike to the same fate of hopeless ignominy and perpetual reprobation, Surely common justice and a prudent sense of tho public interest dictate, no less than hu manity and the benignant religion of the Gospel, that men (like convicts) who having unhappily fallen into crime, but paid the legal penalty, and are now living obedient to the laws, and striving to do well, should be dealt with in the spirit of gentleness and kindness, so likely to strengthen their good resolutions, and not with scorn and indiscriminating opprobrium, which must infallibly throw them back upon an evil course again; and let it further be borne in mind that society has other sources of inconvenience and danger opened upon it at present by the cessation of the war and the consequent discharge of thousands of men from the amy, &e., at no time remarkable for habits of steady md=r, and now less fit than ever for the arts of peace. Upon the possibility or desirableness of reverting to transportation I do not attempt to enter in your columns further than to say that in my opinion the present penal regulations of the country, if only more stringently carried out, are fully equal to the present crisis of crime or a much worse emergency of the kind.

The volume for 1857 has been carefully revised; indeed, so extensive have been the alterations that the work may almost be said to be entirely recomposed. Mlany of these alterations have been rendered necessary by the casualties and consequences of the war with Russia. The number of persons of British title who have been decorated not only with medals and clasps, but with the various grades of the French Legion of Ilonour, the Turkish order of the Medjidie, the Sardinian order of Savoy, of St. Maurice an(d St. Lazarus, &c., has also largely added to the contents of the volume. Correct notices are given of the several ladies who have been authorized by the Queen to assume the rank which they would have been entitled to if their husbands had not faUen in the war, but had survived to receive the honours specified in the Lon&dor Gazette of July 10, 1855. Civil services and political changes have likewise led to knighthoods, baronetcies, and additions to the Privy Council, all of which are accurately recorded. THE REv. G. C.

LA W REPORT. COURT OF CHA-NCEIPY. cox'S-1-N. JAN- 2 IN, BANKRU1PTCY. LS BE THlE ROYAL BRITISH BANY.- X PARTE SHORE (Bcfore thC LORD CHANCELLOP. and Lord Justice Tc.RmRA I alhis was an appeal from * decision of Mr. Commissioner folroyd, refusing the prayer of a petition presented by six of the creditors of the bank The petition was framed under the 20th section of the statute of the 7th and 5th Victoria, cap. 111, entitled "An Act for Facilitating the Winding-Up of Joint Stock Companies unable to meet their Pecuniary Engagements," and asked the Court of Bankruptcy to direct the official assignee to petition the Court of Chancery for an order to finally wind up '.he company, and to appoint a receiver. The clause provided that it should be lawful for the Court of Bankruptcy to direct the credi,ors' assignees to apply to the Court of Chancery by petition, praying that all such necessary orders and directions should be given for the winding up and settling the affairs of such company, and to compel a just contribution from all its members towards the full payment of the debts and liabilities of the company, and of the cost of its winding up, and of finally settling its affairs; and that upon the hearing of such petition the Court of Chancery might refer it to one of the Masters to take all such accounts and make all such inquiries as should be required for the purpose of ascertainigwhat sura of meney should be necessary to be raised by calls or contributions from the members of such company for payment of the debts and liabilities of the comnany and the costs of winding up; and that the Court of Chancery, upon confirmation of the Master's report, might order the payment of the sumsof money whichin suchreport shouldbe found necessary to be paid, and might refer it to the Master to appoint a receiver to collect and receive such sums of money, and pay the same into the bank in the name of the accountant-general to the credit of the company, rand might, upon the petition of the assignees, order such sums of money to be paid in satisfaction of the debts which by the proceedings m bankruptcy sbould have been found due to the creditors of the company and aU persons having claims and demands on the company, and of the costs, or might order such receiver to psy such sums of money in satisfaction of such debts, claims, and demands, and costs in the first instance. Mr. SELNxs, in support of the appeal, after stating shortly the various steps already taken in this unfortunate affair, and which it is quite unnecessary to repeat, said, the substantial object of the petition was to prevent a multi. plicity of actions at law being carried on against the shareholders, and to insure an equal distribution of the assets, both of the company and of the individual partners, among the creditors. The judgment of the Lords Justices on a recent occasion, when the case was before them on another point, plainly enunciated the law to be that the Winding-up Acts did not repeal the statute of the 7th and 8th Victoria, cap. 111 The matter therefore came before the Court on an undisputed adjudication of bankruptcy, and the only question was the most convenient mode of fully carrying it out. Now, by the bankrnptcy the whole of the property became vested in the assignees, but the statute gave them no power to enforce payment against the partners, except in the mode pointed oUt by the 20th section. Either, therefore, the funds to pay the creditors must be obtained under that clause, or the creditors must be left to their individual rights of suing the contribntories. In the present case there were 6,000 creditors and 280 partners, and the question was whether there should be 6i,00 actions going on against the partners, and executions issued against particular individuals, without at the same time enforcing a just contribution from all the parners. The LoRD CLAN-CELLoR asked whether, in the event of the Court granting a receiver, there was anything in the statute which stayed the proceedings of the creditors? Mr. SELWYN.-Yes, the latter part of the 20th section provided that after the appointment of a receiver no execut ion should issue without the sanction of the Court of Chancery. The amount of debts proved was 360,000, and, although the assets of the company were large, it would be necessary to go to the estates of the contributories to make up the full amount to the creditors The Droperty of the company was estimated to pay 12s. in the pound, and the only estion was how the remaining 8s. was to be raised. Te Court would surely not allow the creditors to run a race to obtain payment of their debts when a summary and equitable way of raising the whole sum at once was given by the section of the act referred to. The only objection that such a proceeding appeared open to was that some of the creditors might already have obtained a priority by diligence, which the Court of Bankrnptcywou7ld not deprive them of. The Court, however, by *ppointing a receiver would not deprive them of ny privilege, for the 10th section only enacted that execution should not issue " without the sanction of the Court of Chancery." That sanction would no doubt be accorded in al proper cases. The essence of the bankrupt law was an equal distribution of assets, and what was required in addition was equal contribution among the partners, orthe result would be that those partners who were harassed at law would leave the country or make away with their property, although they were quite wiling to contribute their fair proportion towards the liabilities of the company. As to the objection that the receiver would supersede the official assignee, it was no such thing. He would have nothing wbatever to do with the 12. in hand,but only proceed to coUect the remaining Ss.; nor would the administration of the Court of Bankruptcy be transferred to Chancery. The object sought by the petition was manifestly for the benefit of the creditors, and therefore the application could not be considered premature, as the sooner a benefit was granted the better. The only other question was, did the winding-up order make any difference?9 Certainly not; for that order was nothing more than a decree made between the contributories, and doubtless the Court would give directions that the accounts taken under it should be acted upon. As to whether the official manager or the official asfignee, or botb, should be appointed to the office, the question was merely one of form. Mr. ALLRDY followed on the same side. Sir F. KELLY (Mr. W. D. Lewis with him) said he appeared for the offical manager, who had been served with a copy of the petition, and aU he had to say was that his client felt no other interest in the matter than an anxiety to conform to any order the Court might think fit to make. It would, however, be right for him to state that a cal of 75. per share would in all pDrobability be made on the 10th of the p resent month; and at appeared that by the appointnent of a receiver the interests of all parties would be protected in the meantime, and a multiplicty of demands calculated to ruin the most wealthy of the contributories nrevented. 'fhe LORD CHA,SCELLOR.-There was no necessity to serve the official manager, and the petitioners must therefore pay him his costs. Mr. ROLT, Mr. J. BROWN (of the common law bar), and Mr. GIFFARD opposed the application for the assignees. The question was one raised by the contributories against 'the creditors, or, at any rate, was sanctioned by only five out of 6, 000 creditors. The appellants had taken care to serve the official manager to secure his interest on their side. Before the Comut would think of making the order asked for by the petition it would take care to be satisfied, first, that such an order could be legally made, and, second, that it was for the Denefit of the creditors that it should be made. It appeared to counsel that the assent of the creditorstthemselves ought in the first instance to have been obtained. They hba, however, refused, and the Court might trust 5,000 creditors for knowing their own interest. They were convinced that the effect of such an order would be to give time to the shareholders desirous of so doing to get out of the way or dispose of their property. No legal order, however, could be made, on two grounds-first, because the creditors would not be stopped from going on with their proceedings at law unless prohibited by an injunction, and then they would test the validity of the order at law and, secondly, because the 20th section of the 7th and StL Victoa, cap. lb had been repealed by the subsequent Winding-up Acts. If that clause had not been Dositively repealed, there would be two courses open for choice-one under that section, and the other under the winding-np acts. Now, those two remedies could not be made use of at the same time, and, as there had been a winding-up order in the present case, it was too late to ask that the 20th sect on of the 7th and 5th Victoria should be put into effect. It vwas manifest, however, that the Legislature intended positively to repeal the winding-up clauses of that statute for the subsequent winding-up acts provided in detail for everything to be done that was specified in the 20th section of the former act. The only state of things that ought to induce the Court to make the order applied for was an offer by the contributoriesto pay the whole of their liabilities. It had been said that the cal proposed to be shortly made of 751, per share would settle the whole questionr, but such vas not the fact. At the present time a call had been mande by the directors of 50. per share, which the assignees were advised was a valid call, sad which was now vested in them. If, therefore, the call of 75Lwere made, it would be disputed, and probably carried from court tocourt. Would not an order to stay the proceedings of creditors at law, under such circumstances, be a great hardship to them, and operate to their prejudic a oby w- allo ing the shareholders in the meantime to get rid of their property? Certainly it would; and therefore nothing short of depositing the whole money dne to the creditors ought to induce the Court to make it Should the Court, however, think such an order could be legally made, the application was premature, and ought not to be granted untDl te exact amount of the Iabilities had been ascertained and a call made to meet them The order would be consequential on the first part of the 20th section and only for the purposes there named. Mr. SWYv- replied, and contended that the Winding. up Acts did not repeal the 20th section of the 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 111, and that the two statutes were capable of being carried into eflect at the same time. thThe LoRD CHASCELcOt delivered judgment, and said at the question was one of great practical difficulty for I the Court or the Legislature to decide what ought to be I done in such a case, vhere there were 6,000 persons asserting their rights on the one side and 280 resisting them on the other. It Was very easy for the Legislature to say what should be the actual rights of the parties, but the question was how were those rights to be carried out. The point raised by the petition was whetber 6,000 creditors were to be entitled to take out execution at law, or this Court was to authorize the appointment of a receiver, and thereby stop the legal proceedings Now, in geniral, Courts of Equity were in favour of debts being paida rateaby, and in all cases where they could they o of the property and administered it in that way. The case was, however, different where, like the present, he Court had no power of getting hold of the property, and thi e the principle did not apply. Looking at the case way, it was right to see wh t was the effect of the erent sttutes referred to The act of the 7th and 8th Victoria was the first statuteoenabling joint-stock companies to he made hankrapt. The bankruptcy did not only extendto the property belonging to the company, but also reached the property of each individual shareholder. The 10th aection, therefore, provided that nothinz contained in the act should prevent any creditor from recoveinug judgment and exeen-| 'ion on his debt, in the same way as if there had been no bankruptcy. The Legislature contemplated that after the property of the company had been exhaucted each of t'he sareholders should be liable, and accordingly intro. duced the 20th section. His Lordship read the section, and aid his opinion was that, even if tbe Winding-up Acts had not been passed, no such order as the one asked could be made until the entire liabilities had been ascwrtained. and a call made which would produce 20s. in the pound. Until that had been done be could see no justice in restraining the creditors from pursuing their legal rights xnd that seemed to be the view of the Legislature. Such being the case, no call had ye' been made, nor did be see how any satisfactory call could be made, and therefore it was not competent for the Court to grant the order asked. This was bolting at the matter as if there had been no other statute than the one of the 7th and 8th 7ictoria. It had, however, been followed by the Winding-up Acts, one object Sf which was to amendthaxt very statute. sNow, the Preanmble of tholast act set forth, inter alia, that it was to facilitate the winding u of companies, and the three clauses in the 7 th and 8th .ictora directed to that object were the 2utth, 2Lct, and 22d. The Wimding-up Acts in an elaborate way provided for the carrying out of the game objects as those mentioned in the 2Oth section of the 7th and Sch V'ictoria, and the plain meaning appeared to be that that section and the two following ones were there repealed. Without, however, deciding the question of repeal several orders had been made under the Winding-un Acts giving certain rights and imposing oertain duties or: the contribntories, and therefore it was not now competert for this Court to make another winding-up order, for the petitinn did not ask for the appointment of a receiver p He K E would have been but too glad to be able to mnae an order by which the inconvenience and scandal of so great a rush of executions might have been avoided, but it was not possible to be done upon the present petition. It must therefore be dismi3sed; but, as the question was one of considerable importance, it would be dismissed witho-ut costs. Lord Justice T MtsER, in concurring with the decision of the Lord Chancellor, said he had been most desirous, when the case was before him and tho Lord Justice Knight Brace, a short time back, to put an end to the litigation, but it was clear that it could not be done on the present petition. Without expressing any opinion whhclhr a portion of the 7th and Sth Victoria had been repealed by the Winding-up Acts, or had been incorporated with them, he thought that the appointment of receiver, mentioned in the 20th section of the 7th and 8th Victoria, could only be made to get in the money previously ordered by the Court to be collected, as mentioned in the earlier part of that clause. No such order had been made in the present case, and therefore the petition must be dismissed. The Court did not rise until past 7 o'clock.

Is. 4<L, the assets being 26,0441. lls. 3d.; but the question arises whether the creditors have not a claim upon the estate of the late Ifr. Whittingstall, in which case it is fully understood that their claims will be paid in full. The note affixed to the proceedings is regarded by the creditors as furnishing eNidence in favour of that claim. The trustees of ,Mr. Whitting3tall, on the contrary, contend that their liability etends to only about 20,000!. of the debts of the bank. A sumnmy of the position of the bank on the 13th of Mlarch, 1856, contains the following items :-Creditors on balances of banking accounts, 49,9797.; on notes in circula. lation, 23,0701.; T. E.

Wlliam Smith, debit balance, 20,7921.; E. F. Whittingsttll, 5,159. Mr. LLNKtATiR, in asking for an adjournme:,t and further accounts, said Mr. Whittingstall's death occurred in Mlarch, 1856, after which event the business of the bank had been carried on as previously. The Co3XV1sssozS-.N-You contend that the executor of Mr. Whittingstall are in the position of parSners. Yir. L-s1sATIM said such was the view taken by the assignes. That, however, would be a question for the Court o. Chancery, in which Mr. Whittingstall'. estate was to be administered. Mr. LJVRASNCE, as representing the executors of Mlr. Whittinust1ll, wished not to be understood as acquiescing in Mr. Linklater's observations. Mr. LDSn-LATER said the assignees had collected assets which the representatives of Mr. Whittingstali said belonged to them, and which theycontended should be applied in payment of debts for which Mr. Whittir -tall an2 MIr Smith were jointly liable. fThe tCosrrnsso~gst..Then it is a case of marshalling Mr. LINKLATER said the assignees could not at present divide the funds in hand. If they did so they might be called to account by the creditors of Whittingstall for ap- lying the joint funds to pay the separate creditors of mith. It was necessay to ave information showing the position of the firm at the date of Whittingstall's eath. A statement had been filed, hut the assignees required an account of the debts and liabihties paid off by Mr. Smith since the death of Y-r. sWhttingstaL They wanted to know when the notes now in circulation were issued. At the death of Whittingstall the notes in circulation were 2-%,070!., snd at the time of the bankruptcy the amouit wasS 12,0001. There would be no difficulty in ascertaining what portion of this latter amount was in circulation at the time of Whitting. stall's decease, and it was necessary for the rights of all parties that the amount should be ascertained. An account was required Accordingly. A liquidation account of the late firm was also required, showing what assets had been collec'ed snce Whittingstall's death, and what assets now belonged to the firm. They wanted a trading account since WhittingstaDl's death. The COrMINSssOEP-l I suppose yoU Want a rest made at the death of Whittingstall? 3Ur. Ln;LAml- Yes. Mr. Cannan, the official assignee, said the bankrupt had furnisbed an account of the joint and separate estates, and the claim of the executors of Whittingstall could be easily disposed of They themselves said that the bankrupt had contracted new debts to the amount of .30,0001. to pay off Whittingstalt's old debts. Ho (Mr. CaLnnan) deprecated aLny course that might occasion expense and unnecessary litigation. Mr. LSme ATRM said that unless the accounts now desired were furnigbed he should advise the assignees to divide nothing. They would become involved in proceedingR in Chancery, and litigation would be nnnecessarily occasioned. Mr. Cannan.-I could on my own responsibility ROW col. lect Smith's asets and divide them among the creditors. Mr. LINMLATER.-If Mr. Cannan would give the ussignees a guarantee they would be obliged for the offer. *'s Cannan was understood, ih reply to this invitztion, to decline to incur any personal responsibility in the matter. Mri. MURRAY read a statement which he contenided fur. nished nearly all the information now asked by Mr. Link. later. Mr. LLN1LATMR said what the assignees required was the same information in respect to debtors to the estate that had been f ished in respect to creditors to the estate. The position of the notes in circulation was absolutely neces. Ea& Hol%oup. said he could see many reasons for snposing that they might get into the greatest possible diuculty unless tne accounts as}ed for were furnished.

MzDDLESEX sEssrozNS, Fnday, Jam. 2. (Beforc the A srsrIsrJUDGR at ClcrkcanwdL) Joseph Wilkinson 25 was indicted for feloniously reeiving soven shav;s and other articles, the property of WN'ijam Stanley, well knowing them to have been stolen. Mir. Sleigh was counsel for the prosecution, Mr. J. P. Doyle for the prisoner. lThe prosecutor was a draper at Knightsbridge, and he had in his service a young man named Hil, who at the latter end of November absconded, and wbo, there was reason to believe, was a ticket-of-leave man. He had been in tho trosecutor'6 service about eight months. About a month efore Hill absconded a large quantity of goods was missed from the stock, and after he had gone a fulrther quantity was missed, the value of the whole being estimated at 1001 On the2,2dof.November Sergent Jackson, of the H division, was in Goulston-street, Whitechapel, abont 8 in the mornming, when ho saw a mxn go into a grocer's shop kept by the prisoner, with alarge bag, andhe was i nduced to iolow and make inquiry respecting what the bag contained. The prisonerpretended not to know of any bag having been orought in, but the sergeant went into a back parlour, and as he did o he heard an inner door shnt Toere was no man there, but he found the bag, and took possession of it. The prisoner persisted that he know nothing about it. It was opened in his presence, and found to contain drapery goods, and tho sergeant took him inito custody upon suspicion of having stolen property in his Possession, but ho was discharged after one remand. Anoter person to whom the prisoner had sold drapery goods was likewise taken into custody; but he was disoharged, and made a witzess in the case. The prisoner had declined to say where he got the things from which he had sold to that person. Subsequently Jackson found that the articles in the bag ha been stolen from the prosecutor's premises, and they were identified as his property; upon which the prisoner was again apprehended, and the magistrate sent him for trial. The prosecutor also identified some of the articles which the prisoner had been dealing in. The suggestion was that Hill stole the property, and tho case for the prosecution was that the prisoners received it, knowing full well how it had been received. Mr. DOYLE urged that there was no case of receiving made out in the sense requirod by the statute, and that the prisoner had been the victim of another porson. The jury returned a verdict of Guilfy. Sentence was deferred. Isaac Cleows 42, and Susan Thrasher, 30, a married woman, were indicted, the former for stealing lG3b. of coals the property of the Great Northern Rail3way Company, aDa three bushels of barley, the property of Edward N iggins and another, his masters, and the latter for feloniously receiving the coals knowing them to have been stolen. Mtr. Giffard appeared for the prosecution. The prisoner Ulews was a carman in the employ of tho contractors for the delivery of coal from the (:reatSNorthern Railw.y, and on a day mentioned in the indictment he was sent to deliver some coal at an hotel at the west-end. For reasons3 which may readily bedivined the nlice were watehim6 him, and he was seen to take some coa from a sack, put it into the horse's nosebag and take it into a house whero the other prisoner lived. An officer followed and xslked tho woman for the bag. She denied all knowledge of it, but it was afterwards found there. The jury found Clews GsuiWy. and Arqniit:d Thresher. The AiisSTAN-T.JUD(:E Sentenced CleCs to six months' hard labour. Elizabeth Townsend, 2.5, was indicted for maliciously cutting and wounding Susannah Smith. She pleaded Guilty."I The prlsouer and the proRecutrix were sisters, and the former, when called upon, said she went to se, ber siser, when they had some drink, nder the influence of which they quarreUed, and sbe took up A knife which wsVX lying on the table and struck her with it on the nose. She was sorry for it. The prosecutrix stated that the prisoner, when she had been dnnking, had frequently threatened to take her life, but when she was sober she was quiet and inoffensive. The AsuSTAXT-JUDGE said the prisoner must be taught that if shedid things in drink which she was sorry lor when sober she must refrain from drink or take aU tho consequences of the acts she committed. excitesnent by drink was no excuse for any unlawful act. T7he Court could not pass a light sentence in a case where a deadly weapon had been used, and where the blown might have resulted fatally. Ho should sentence her to six months' hard labour. George Pope, a lad 16 years of age, pleaded " Guilty " to a charge of stealing money to the axnount of 108l. lOs. in the dwelling-house of Bobert Robinson, his mnaster, whose money it was. The prosecutor, it appeared, was a potato merzsant at Lslington, and the pr ioner hsad been in his service ap to last July, when he absconded. He had access to where his master kept his money, and he abstracted in the whole 1O08 10s., with which he set up A horse and cart, and, young as he was, started in business on his own account as a horse-desler. When he was ap rehoended he put a bold front upon the matter, and said the money he had boen dealing with was part of a legacy of 1501. which an aunt had left him, bat he could p roduco no proof of any such legacy, nor could any source be suggested whence he could obtain such wealth except his master's coffer. The prosecutor said he hsd ascertained that the prisoner had been discharged from two previons satuations. The AssisTAs r-JUDnr asked if he had a character with him. Prosecutor sAid he had not; he was a stranger to him when he gave him the situation. The AssisTAN-rJUDG said this would be a warning to him to have a character with a servant and al'so t keep his money at a banker's. The prosecutor said part of the money he had s-aved in a savinsg-bank sat Richmond when he was a boy. The AssisTA-T-JrDUsE said this was a very serious case, and had the prisoner beena little older he shoald have passed upon him a sentence which would have sent him out of the country. Hle should sentence him, as it was, to bo kept tohard laboutr for one year. Te prisoner's homse and cart were ordered to be given up to the prosecutor. (Before Arr. CREAISY.) William Billows; 27, carpenter, and John Ltfcvre 40, silkweaver, were indicted for having stolen 3(?0 picces of rosewood and mahogany veneer, value 151., the property of Alfred Grippe. Mr. Poland prosecuted; Mr. 3LacEntcer appeared for the prisoners. The prosecutor was a timber merchant, carrying on his businessin Wellington-place, Bethnal-green; and it alpeared that a quantity of veneers was stol..n from his premises A person saw two men with a truck full of timber of that description, and he gave informatio.i to the prosecutor, who then discovered that the robberv had been committed. The tracks of wheels wero traced from tho prosecutor's premises to a house in Gibralt.ar-plame, where the veneers wore found, and the prisoners were in the hoaue, but there was no satisfactory eidence that they were the two men seen with the truck. The jury Acquitted tho prisoners. Thomas Cummins, 46, sailor, and Alfred Huld-a'n, 41 wafermaker, were indicted for feloniously breakig and entering the waxrebouse of Joseph Talton and stealing proyerty of the value of 36C. and 11.

On t'r o morning of theo6th of iDecenmher the prisoner Cummins was wen by two constables, 1:;\ and 08 H, whecig a truck, aided by another man, in Charchstrct, Spitalfi ds, the prisoner Holdran and another person walking behind. Suspecting them, the constables fo:loved but suddenly a whistle was given by one of the meIn behind to give warning that they were watched, heb Cmnmminns an the other man left the truck and rian rAw.a. (ine vf the officers went after them, and after a run of ab o:O yards captured Cummins, whom he took hack to the treek. As soon as the signal had been given Holdman and las companion ran off in another direction, and tLe other iffloer went in pursuit and brotught back the ft-mi,tr. The truck was found to contain somne sacks and cAnvass, which had just before been stolen, togeth' r with some loose cash, from a warehoubc belonging to the prosecutor in Crispin-street. Cumminn a-seried th.t h.b had been hired to draw the truck, and did not know that the goods it contained had been stolen. Holdman sud he wa.s walking innocently behind, and kncwr nothing of the matter. One of the witnesses saw a tmrck drawn fromi the gteway of the pro.secutor's premises, and to the bect of belief Holdmann wa8 one of the men then drawinig it. The jury found both prisoners (suilrt,. Cummins vas sentenced to six months' hard Labour Holdman, who was an old offender, to fo:er years' penai servitudo. Ann Adarnms 45, was indicted for having ¶ollen three Bank of England notes, valec 151., a paurse, anid IC. i n money from the person of WilliaT Rich'noud.

POLICE. XANSION-UOVS-.-Edward Horace Montefiore, charged 'with having forged bills of exchange and letters of credit to the amount of 5,3001., was again brought before the LORD MAYOR for examination. Mx. Ribton appeared for the Prosecution; Mr. Lewis for the defence. Mr. Cree, of the firm of Cree, Skinner, and Co., of Glas. gow, merchants, said,-I know the prisoner. I had interviews with him in Glasgow several times in July, 1855. The letters produced (the letters were read at the last exatuination) were addressed to our house. They are signed '-Lyons," but the name of Montefiore is mentioned in one o them. In our communications with him reference was made to these communications. It was respecting the procuring a passage by the LightDing to the Cape of Good Ropo. The prisoner asked at one time if a bill could be negotiated in Glasgow. We said it could be done. I cannot recollect whether any auUsion wvas made to the amount. I believe my partner knows more than I do about the bis. Cross-examined by Mr. Levis.- If my partner had been written to eight days ago he could not have left his business. Re-examined by Mr. Ribton.-The prisoner gave the nlame of Montefiore. I should not expect to find that Lyons was the person who was MontefLore. Mr. Thomas Watson said,-I was a director of the Cape of Good Hope Bank. I recollect having seen the doculments (the letters of credit) produced at the Cape. I cannot say by whom they were delivered. I saw the priEoner in the bank parlour there. I only saw him once there, and he was requested to explain about the bills. These letters of credit were lying on the table, but I do not recollect that they were shown to him. After the directors had refused to discount the bills the prisoner was asked whether he had any other means of paying the debt due to the Cape of Good Hope Bank? He said he could draw upon the London and Westininster Bank, and expressed his surprise that the directors should hesitate about taking his draught in face of the letters which he had presented from that establishment, or words to that effect. I cannot recollect the precise words. The letters were lying upon the table. They had been sent for to show to the Attorney-General before the prisoner came in. I cannot say that the prisoner saw them. They were in a position where he could have seen them. I understood the reference about the letters to apply to these letters. Cross-examined.-The writing part of the letters was upwards,. I could not swear whether they were lying on the top of one another. I cannot say whether the writing of more than one could be distinguishled, nor can I say on which of them the writing was discernible. I consider this (the second letter) a letter of credit. A letter of credit generally specifies the amount. I also saw the prisoner at another office at the Cape. Re-examined.-The prisoner was advanced 7941. upon the faith of these letters. We required some settlement of the account, and that w.as the object of the prisoner's visit to the bank. Our suspicious were excited as to the bills, and afterwards as to the letters of credit. Mr. C. Hlunter Hodgson, of the firm of Hamilton, Ross, and Co., of Cape Town, said,-I know the prisoner fronm having seen him frequently at the Cape. I am acquainted with his handwriting. I think I have acquired a sufficient knowledge of his writing to express a belief on the subject. The letter of credit (No. 2) is, I should say, in his handvriting, and I should say the same of the other two letters. All these are, to the best of my belief, in his handwriting. Cross-examined by Mr. Lewis.-I never saw hims write. I have seen other letters of his. Those letters were in the same writing. They were sent to Mr. IRoss from the prisoner. It is because 1 have received a letter which purported to come from the prisoner that I form this belief. I should say this is his wvriting, and this also (the letters of credit folded up). Re-examined.-We have advanced money to the prisoner to the amount of Sit. I have seen checks vhich purport to be drawn by the prisoner, and the monley was paid on them, but I did not see him w rite them. A check book was given to him, and he drew for the money. The LOlID MAYOR remanded the prisoner till Saturday week, after having heard Mr. Lea-is contend at considerable lensgth that there was no case against his client within his Lordship's jurisdiction. The LORD MAsYoIs requested that the press would acknowledge his receipt of 1t. in postage stamps from <0. A. lsf." for the poor-box. GnILDHALL.-Mr. Surr Edward Pack Barber, the secretary to the Samaritan Institution, appeared, in discharge of his recognizances, beZoro Sir R. W. CARD'EN and Alderman }IXMSPIIERY to answer the charges of unlawfully obtaining under false pretences two barrels of porter, one barrel of biscuits, and ones sack of ilour, with intent to defraud Messrs. Hioare and Co. brewers; Messrs. Aanners and Wells, brewers; Miessrs. HXuntley and Palmer, biscuit bakers of Reading; and Miessrs. Ponsford antd Co., of the City Flourmills. Mr. Sleigh, instructed by Mr. Buchanan, conducted the prosecution, and Mr. Joyce, instructed by Mir. Horseley, attended for the defence. The depositions taken on the former occasion having been read over by Mr. Afartin (the chief clerk), and a number of witnesses having been examined, the examination of the zirls Mary Anne Hayes and Ellen Daley, the most important part of tbe evideiice, was gone into. Mary Anne Hayes said,-I am 16 years of age. I am inmate of the Refuge for the Destitute in Whitecrossstreet. I have neither father nor mother. On Christmiasday, 1S55, I was at the Samaritan Institution, and had some meat, potatoes, and bre.ad. I had no beer or biscuits on that day. On Monday last I went to the Samaritan Institution, and Mr. Barber gave me soine soup. There were a great many oor personis there besides myself. I saw Mr. Barber, who asked who was present at the Christmas dinner last year? Mr. Sleigh.-Did he say anything about beer or biscults? Mr. Joyce objected to this leading question. Mr. Sleigh justified the course he was pursuing, and the Witness then continued-Mlr. Barber asked us if we had had any beer and biscuits. He did iiot refer to any particular time. I said, "No, I had no beer or biscuits," and Mr. Barber then kept nsie and another youmn. girl back, and asked us if wve wvould go up for him: and he said lie would give us bali-a-crown and a pair of boots if we would go up and say we h.ad beer and bLicuits. I said, I would not tell a falsehood for anybody. He said the same to the other girl. There was no other person present, because he had cleared the place. The other girls were all called out and had their soup, and were sent away. Afr. Sleigh inquired how slse was kept back? 'Witness. -He told us to sit down and vwait. Cross-examisned.- I wvas in service in Exrnouthstreet, Clerkenwell, and left there three days before -Christnias. My mistress, ,Mrs. Stacey, went to Australia, and would have taken me with her, but I eould not go. I was with her three years. Before I went to service I was at home with ey umother until else died, and then Mr. Viney got sue into St. Giles's Rieforiniatory Institution, until I went t Mrs. Stacey's. Thei-e wore a great many preseent when Mr. Barber asked who had beer ond biscuits. l'he tables were full. T Yo of us said "No," and ten said " Yes, they had beer a'd biscuits." I did not say I had beer on Christmiias-day. It was Pettit who first spoke toqme on this subject siuce illr. Barber. The day before y0%erday Pettit caine to ine in Farringdon-market. I kave hat! soup before, but Mlr. Barber has not given me any since Monday. I sleep at the Refuge, where I get bread niglit and itorning. I have had nothing during the day. I eaw Mr. Horseley on Monday last, but did not tell hium I had beer at the institution on Christmas-day, l::ii. Mr. Barber's brother was there eni Monday with Mr. Horseley. Mrs, Barber and her son ansi daughter were also there in different parts of the room. I did not tell MIr. lforsiley in the presence of both gentlemen that I had beer and biscuits, for I liad none. Re-exarnined.--After asil the rest had left the roomi a young man cause dov-n aild asked us our names, and after ie had put them down on paper lie winked his eye upon us, and asked us tosay the beer was drawis in the soup cans, and that the potatoes 'vere beautiful and tioury. Mr. Joyce objected that a man's wiliking Isis eye could not be evidence. Sir R. W. CADIZ7sn said a wink of tie eye was not very material. Mr. Joyce said but it cannot be received. Sir R. W. CARDEN said but he might receive it in his own imind. Mr. Sleigh said thlis Mnin wvas fr. Barbefs own agent. Air. Joyce called for tse proof of agency. Alderman H rusi sr-nEr said Mr. Barber (the witness had said) was upstairs at the time. WVitness.-I refused to sa) the potatoes were beautiful, because they were all bo-ied to water. Sir P. .WE. C.tswsx arLed ber if sie still adhered to her former statenment, tlhat Ihtr. Barber had offered her half-s%.crown and a pair of boots .o state she had beer aid biscuits on Christmnas-day! Witness.-I do, Sir ; I. am positive he made that offer to me. It was after the muan vinked at me anid puLt our namies on paper. Sir It. W. CAJI1 EN said it was,7 extremiely creditable, supposing ler e-vidence vwere true, havinsg acted as she had done. (Applause.) Mr. Joyce otbected to tli mniode of treating the case against Mr. Barlber. Sir IW W. C.l47 .'N said he did not care for Mr. Joyce's objections, and he vouuld take care this witneoss did not lose -the nsoney. Mr. Joyce again objected to tL`.ff case beinig decided in this mnanner. Sir H. W. CA I:1EY s-aid lie wa there to dispense justice, and if Mir. ioyce iisnp-e -ed Ihis vo-acit, or fairnese when lie said that lie bld no favour for eit6er side. he would order Mr. Joyce to leave the coo it, for -, -oaulh have the bench treated with proper respect. (Tsnicsltuols applause.) Mr. Joyce sid he ieant no dircijsecG to time beach, hut -it did appear to him that the case was beiu,g preiaturely Aecided. Order having been ru-stoDel, Ellen Daley -was cadled ard said.-I wa at the insti'ution on Christmas-day, 15.5. bhu had lieitlmer beer inor biscuits. I was there again era Monday last, and had a basin of Soup. Mr. Barber was there, anod avl:ed those to stand up who had any food on Christmas-day, LSl85 m A great many stood up. He then aiked if an' of theism had beer or biscuits; and sonme said. they had, but the last witness and I sad we had isot. Mr. Barber took two vouns women up-tairs, anli soon after lie casime diwn and told Hay's and hte to re-main behind. The kitchen was cleared out, and Mr. B ts-her then faid if I wouild come up to the court lie would give rme half-a-crowmi and a pair of boots to say that I had beer and biscuits oni Christmas-day. I said I would not swear to a lie. We wercVien let out. The two women Mr. Barbaer took upstairs weere poor people like my. self. I havo lad no soupt since Liforsday. I waited outside the institution from 8 o'clock in the morning tuntil 2 o'clock, when there was ino more soup. Others had got in, and had soup. CroEs-exauiined.- There were not a great many got soup during the day while I waited. I went at 8 o'clock to get washed, and the last witness and I were allowed to wash thero. I was not amoDg the number who aid they had beer and biscuits on Chrishtas-day, 1t:i5. Mr. Barber told those who had beer to reuiain. and they all went out but four. We remained because Mr. Barber told us to do so. Some of those whlo said they had beer went out afterwards. I 'aw Mi, Horseley at the institativn on Monday. H. And Mr. Barber went upstairs, and the womea were taken up to t'hem. Re-examined by the Court.-On Tuesday last I waited Close to the door of the institntion, but I was not let in, wnile those bebind me were admitted. Sir R. W. CARDEN asked her why she did not go in? Witness said she could not get in unless told to go in by Mr. Barber. I had no ticket, but some of the other girls Mr. Sleigh said he should not carry this case any further now. Sir R. W. CARDEN said now that the prosecution was closed it would be advantageous to the defendant to adjourn the ease before going into his evidence, it being late to begin Mr. Joyce said it would be an advantage. Mr. Sleigh said it was desirable to close the inquiry at the earliest opportunity, and therefore applied for a short adjournment. Sir h. W. CARDEN accordingly adjourned the case, and said,-In consequence of the evidence of the two girls to-day this case has assumed a very serious aspect, and, although on the former occasion I thought it sufficient to accept the defendant's own recognizances, I must now require his own surety in 1001. and two bail in o01. each. Mr. Sleigh.-The case may assume a very important shape, and the charge may resolve itself into one of subornation of perjury. Sir R. V. CAMPDENn complimented the two girls on the manner in which they had given their evidence. He had never seen girls in such an unfortunate position give their evidence in the examination in chief, and even in crossexamination, as they had done; and he assured them that the Almighty would always protect them in the cause of honesty and truth. He would take care they should not lose the halfcrown that had been offered to them. Mr. Joyce said he felt it his duty to object again to the matter being prejudiced by the bias evinced in the alderman's remarks, as it was the intention of Mr. Barber to indict these girls for perjury. Sir R. W. CARDEN said he was not going to enter into that matter now. Mr. Joyce said that the alderman had entcred into it by making t e observations he had done. Sir R. W. CARDEN said at all events the girls were not guilty of perjury yet. The case was then adjourned until 2 o'clock on Saturday (this day), *Mr. Charles Horseley and Mr. Henry Charles Barber being security for the appearance of Mr. Barber. Sir R. W. CAPDEN remarked, in conclusion, that Mr. Joyce was the first who had ever eharged him with partiality as a magistrate, and he therefore asked him if it was possible to have acted with greater impartiality when he had allowed the defendant to stand on the bench behind his counsel throughout this investigation ? BOw-STREF.T.-Mr. JARDTxE has received 1Os. Gd. for the poor-box from " 0. K." MARLBOROMI(I-STREET.-From " S. L." 61. has been received for the poor-box. MARaYioNEI S.-" T. D.' has' forwarded to the Court ot. 5s. for the poor-box. CLERKENWELL.-The two prisoners, Leopold Redpath, late the chief registrar and transferrer of stolc) to the Great Northern Railway Company, and William Charles Comyns Kent, formerly the chief clerk in the same department, who stand charged with having committed enormous frauds on the Great Northern Railway Company, were again brought up from the House of Detention, and placed at the bar before fr. TY-RwHSiTT for the purpose of being finally committed for trial at the Old Bailey. The prisoners do not appear to have suffered much from their long incarceration, although it was remarked that Redpath did not seem so confident as before. Ur. IIumphreysatteuded for the prosecution; Mr. Wontncr defended Rtedpath, and MIr. Dodd appeared for the prisoner Kent. The voluminous evidence taken on the former occasions having been put in proper form was read over by Mr. Mould, the chief clerk, and duly signed by the magistrate previous to the final commitment against the prisoners being made out. It u-ill be remembered that a third person is charged, and vill be tried for aiding in these frauds-viz., Mr. Thomas Hogben, a clerk in tle service of Messrs. Field, Son, and Wood, the large sharebrokers, of Throgmorton-court, city. This firm transacted the principal part of the business for Redpath, and thus it was that Mr. Hogben was drawn into Hedpatl's meshes. The charge against Mr. Rogben is that of having been the attesting witness to a forged transfer-deed, which purported to transfer 1,0000l 41. per cent. Preference Stock of the Great Northern Railway, from a M[r. Beckeway to Mr. Stephen George Hansmond, who is the adopted son of the prisoner efedpath. So unlimited were the confidence and the trust placed in the integrity and honesty of the prisoner Redpath that Mr, Wood stated, in cross-examination by Mr. Sleigh, who appeared for Mr. Hogben, that if Redpath had come to him and told him that the signature was the signature of Hammond he should have believed him, and might have acted upon it. Mr. Sleigh made a strong appeal to the magistrate to dis- I charge3hr. Hogben; but hlr. Ti-invo-nirr said that in such a serious case as that of a transfer being forged it was proper that it sbould go before a jury. If sich a course as that suggested by the learned counsel were adopted it would be most dangerous in a cominercial country like this. He, however, said he would accept bail. Bail was then put in for Hogben, and he was liberated. The prisoners Redpath and Kent, who said that they should reserve their defence, were then fully committed for trial. The prisoner Pedpath is committed on six distinct cases of forgery and one of fraud, and Kent with being concerned with Kedpath in four caces of forgery. The prisoners were then removed by Turner, the gaoler, and were in the course of the evening conveyed in the van to Newgate. "0. O. N." has forwarded 20s. in postage stamps for the poor-box, requesting an acknowledgment in this iournal. TsrAir.s.-Christian Schneider, a German sugar-baker, about 27 years of age, was brought up on remand before Mr. YARS'Lr., charged with cutting and wounding Robert Curtis Denham, an American sailor, and was cou mited for trial at the next sessions of the Central Criminal Court. "J. H." has forwarded 20s.to the poor-boxfund. LA,IIBETu.-Susan Waller, a well-dressed young woman, was finally examined before the Hon. G. C. No-TroN, on a charge of being concerned, with two others not in custody, in robbing William Moss of 2w5s. The prosecutor deposed that lie was a labourer, and resided at Woolwich, and that on boxing-night lie went to Astley's Theatre to see the performances there. After leaving the theatre he had some refreshments, and ultimately went to Hart's, the nighthoumse in the W'estminsterbridge-road, where he met the prisoner and treaied her. It being then too late to get home he asked her where he could get a bed, and the prisoner said islq would take him where he could find one. He accompanied her to Charlesstreet, and she took him into a room where he sasv another young woman in bed, and lie objected to stop there; upon which both of thenm called out, "Tom !" and a man instantly entered the room, and seized him by the throat so tight that for some moments he waq unable to breath. While so held by the man both the women searched his pockets, taking from them a sovereign, five shillings in silver, and a button-head which was among Ihis silver. As soon as the womzn had robbed him the man " Tom" dragged hiom to the door, flung him into the street, and closed the door. Having remarked the number, he went in search of a policeman, and oni finding one he told him how he had been robbed an-l took himu to the house, when he found the prisoner in bed, and gave her into custody. When searched at the statiosihouse the button-head that had been taken from him was found, with some silver, in her pocket. Police-constable Henry Barrett, Sl L, corroborated the latter part of the prosecutor's statemenit. Mr. NORTON.-Have yon been able to hear anything about this man Toni ? Constable.-No, Sir. 'Ime prisoner bas had a young man follower, hut I cannot hear anything hbount himi. The prisoner acknowledged she had taken the prosecutor houise, but denied robbing him. She was fully committed for trial. A Post-office order for 11. has been received fronm ",j. HI." for the poor-box.
T1nE FISHERY BOiED.-We are in a position to anticipate, to some extent. the report of the commission of inquiry into the Fishery Board, which has Just been laid before Governmnent, and on which its resolution to maintain, modify, or abolish the board will be founded. The report is one of much length, and enters with greater minuteness into details than the rapid flight of the commissioners over the fishing districts niiglht have led us to anticipate. It enters fully into the brand question, o01 whiich the commis. sioners are divided, one being for its total abolition, and two for its rete ntion on payment of a fee for each barrel branded. The report also disposes of the general constitution, useful. ness, and influence of the board in promoting the fisheries. The cutter finds no supporters, and in other "miatters of detail there is a pretty strong exeression of opinion that modification is desarable. In regard to harboiurs in general, and the harbour of Wick in particuUr, the commissioners are as one. In tbe care of WVick they stronglv urge on Government the import:nce of aidiing in imiereasseg the accommodation for fishing purposes, and adduce a variety of strong and imnportant reasons in suppart of their views. ib is likely that on the assembling of Y.'arliament the report will be laid on the table of the Rouise of Commonns, when we shall have an oppo:tunity of submitting it to our readers. In the meantiume, these remarks mncp be taken as indicating its general scope, ard may prepare the trade for the resobatiosi of Governnient, which is expected to be an expression of willingnens to reteco the board and brand, on payment of a fee for herrigggs receiving the latter.-Nor7Ui-.a Ensignj. SUICInE OF TFSE CRIEF WARTEFAR IN MA1n.Bt,t PR.soN.-On -i%ursdaycnorming Mr. Bedford, thieWestminster coroner, heldan inquest at Milbank Prist on the body of Mr. John Jackson, aged 45, the principal infirniary warder, who committe(l suicide an Tecsday last by taking prussic acid. Jau,es Higge- (a prisoner) depused that on Tuesday last lie was sent by Mr. (lark, the compounderof medicines to call Mr Jackson. He vent to the deceseed'sroom, and, after knocking at the door4fer somse time without receiving any answer, looked in, and saw hini lying on the bed. Witness went up to hiiii and pvJled him by the coat, but he still gave no answer, artd appeared as if he was asleep, making a noise like snoring. A somall bottle was in one of his bands. Dr. Bailey said thai the deceased was an exceedingly good and active officer, but sometimes he presented the appearance of a pergon whose mind was confused by drink, although Dr. Bailey never saw bim intoxicated. On Tuesday moridag the deceased looked very strange, and was much fleshed in the face. Half an hour afterwards witness was caaDed to his room, and found him lying on the bed I suffering from the effects of poison. The stomach pump was iused, but the deceased expired while the pipe was in his throat. The bottle contained a few drops of prussic acid.

MBTROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. A special meeting oe the Board of Works was held in the Council Chamber, Guildha4l yesterday, to consider the subject of altering and amending the by-law relative to the width of streets and alleys, to the effect that the width of 40 and 20 feet required respectively shall be understood to mean 40 and 20 feet of carriage and footway, irrespective of any gardens, foreconrts, or other spaces. Major LYON moved a resolution to the above effect, which was seconded by Mr. DEN?NIS, and agreed to. THE MAIN DR.MANAGE SCHEME. The clerk (Mr. Woolrych) read a letter addressed by Sir Benjamin Hall to Captain Douglas Galton, RIE., Mr. James Simpson, C.E., and Mr. James E. Blackwell, C.E., to whom Sir Benjamin Hall had referred the plan for the main drainage of the metropolis. (A copy of the letter was inserted in The Times of Thursday last.) MIr. H. L TAYLOR observed that the word " reservoirs," occurring in the printed copy of f7se Times, did not appear to be inserted in the copy read by the clerk. Mr. WoOLRYCH referred to the manuscript of the letter, and said that the word ' reservoirs" did not occur in the copy. After some observations by Major LYON as to certain discrepancies adverted to in the letter of Sir B. Hall, Mr. BAZALGEYTH said, in explanation, that he was not aware of any discrepancies in his designs or reports. On the 21st of November the Chief Commissioner asked him what was the present discharge of sewage from the metropolis. Attbattime there existed no recent information on the subject, and he answere(d the question offhand and to the best of his recollection of the results of former gaugiu of the sewers; but that answer had no reference to the sizes of the sewers designed by him. Since that period an official report had been issned,-which showed thatithe metropolitan water supply had been doubled within the last six years. In his last report he had availed himself of that information, and bad given the present approximate discharge of tho sewage. But neither the past nor the present flow of sewage at aU affected the sizes of the proposed main draminage sewers, because they were designed to carry off the rainfall and a largely increased quantity of sewage due to a future increase of population and water supply. On the motion of Major LYON, the explanation of Mr. Bazalgette was ordered to be printed. It was then moved by Mr. Deputy H.tRRisON, seconded by MaJorLYOS, and ag,reed to, that the engineer (Mr. Bazalgette) be instructed to give every information in his power to the engineers appointed by the First Commissioner to consider the plan which had been submitted by the board to the Government. MR. 25ORENVOOD'S SCHEME FOR DRArNI,NG TIlE -METROPOLIS. Mr. D'IFFAN-GER considered that Mr. Morewood had great claims on the public as weU as on the Board of Works. He had devoted himiself to the subject of the drainage of the metropolis for upwards of 11 years, and had expended not less than 8001. in prosecuting his views before Parliament, a committee of which had rePorted favourably of his plan. Mtany individuals had been heard by the board in support of their schemes, but hitherto Mr. MIorewood had gen refused a hearing. He therefore moved- "'That the resolution of the hoard of the 22d of October, negativing the motion that Mr. Morewood be heard by the ooard in support of his scheme, be revoked." Mr. NICHOLAY seconded the motion, and said it would bebuta siplcact of justice to Mr. Morewood that he should have an opportunity of laying his plan before the board. Mr. H. L TAYLOR thought it would be very absurd for the board to entertain a scheme for the drainage of Lonldon when they had already adopted a plan which had been referred by the First Commis3ioner to three eminent engineers. Alter some further discussion the motion was put, when on a division there were 11 in favour of and 12 against it. The motion was therefore lost. Mr. Deputy HALRRISON gave notice of a motion:- " That it be referred to the WVorks Committee to inquire into the state and condition of the several communications in the me' polls, including the bridges over the Thames and the approaehes thereto, and to report whether the commn.mcations and approaches are adequate to the present and icreasing tratffic, and, if not, the best mode of improving the same." THE DILAPrDATED ROUSES, STAMFORD-STREET. Mr. TAYI.OR said that since he had called the attention of the board to the state of ruin into which several of the houses in Stamford street, Blackfriars, had been suffered to fall by the perversity of the owner of the prorerty, he had received several communications from persons interested in the property in that neighbourhood. Among others he had received the folloving letter - "1 8, Stamford-street, Dec. 31. " Sir,-Observmg your remarks about my wretched neighbour, I take the liberty of remarking that there are seven houses in this street falling into ruin, worth about 4001. a-year, the next door to mine having been bought by her for the purpose of making it empty. Some of them are vithout roofs, and the rain makes a clean breach right through them, while the ticket-of-leave men have just been removing away the lead, which is so useless to her. My house is my own, and I am obliged to live in it as I cannot let it, and she is trying desperately to drive me out of it. "C There are similar blocks of houses on Snow-hill, worth about as much, one house adjoining Picket-street, Strand, by the Angel, and, I am told, also opposite the church at Whitechapel, and at Somers-town. " She is now removing and partly puling down No. 5, under orders from the Police Commissioners, on account of its dangerous state, and rebuilding it again for another quarter-century's decay. " Mr. Charles Pearson is well acquainted with the facts^ I am well known to Sir James Duke, Mr. Alderman Wire, and Mr. Thwaites. " I have to apologi7e for trespassing upon you with these facts. "I have the honour to be, Sir, " Your very obedient servant, " CIsURLES PRIDDON. IC H. Lowman Taylor, Esq." Re certainly thought it quite time that some control should be exercied over property whieh was suffered by its owners to fall into a state of decay, so as to dasinnfy the interests of other parties, and he hoped the board would deem it right to adopt measures to prevent the recurrence of such public mischief. The board then adjourned.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In a report of the meeting of the board of guardians of the City of London IJnion which appears in The Tines of this day a paragraph skates, " That MIr. Wheeler and other guardians strongly censured the conduct of the chairman and vice-chairman, a)d commented rather severely upon the loose wvay in which the bankers, Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Smith, had transacted the business of the union." In justice to Meessrs. Smith, Pryne, and Co. we feel bound to say that the general feeling of the board was qaite contrary to this statement. It is tnre MIr. Wheeler intimated that we might be enabled levally to repudiate payment of the balance of about 4,0GG1., Nvhich Messrs. SLmith, Payne, and Co. had liberally advanced, as they believed, for the necessities of the union; but this was received by the board with an unanimous shout of disapprobation; and we beg respectfully to assure you and Messrs. Smith, Payne. and Co. that their account, which has been under our investigation, has, in our opinion, been conducted by them with perfect accuracy as well as with great liberality. We remain. Sir, vour most obedient servants JOSE'H TAYLOR, I Members of the f Investigation I Committee. City of London Union, a1, St. Mary Axe, bec. 31, 1856. Chairman. Pro tea,l. JOHN FINLAY. JAS. ABBIS, WXL.

A RKMMA.RABLi TRAGEDY.-The Rochester Armerican has the following remarkable statement, contained in a letter from Monmouth, Warren county, Illinois, under date of December 12 :-" A bloody tragedy was performed at the BaldNwin House in this city this afternoon. I was conversing with a gentleman in Dr. Thayer's drug store about 2 oclock, when the terrible cry of murder was heard, and we all started out to discover the cause. We were soon directed by the throng of people to the abovenamed hotel, distant only a few yards, *nd there, weltering in their blood, lay the victims of the most sanguinary single-hand conflict it has been my lot to witness. It is impossible to describe the horror depicted on the visages of that throng of spectators called there at a moment's warning. The circumstances are as follows:-A Mr. Fleming, an elderly gentleman, and two sons, about 25 to 28 years of age, had called upon a Mr. Crosier, at his rooms at the Baldwin HouLse, armed each with a loaded pistol to coerce the latter lgentleman into a concession and retractation of a calumny affecting tleir daughter and sister, with wlich they charged Mr. Crosier. Mr. Crosier, after some pretty warm language had passed between the parties, agreed to and did sign a retractation, in the presence of a friend whom the Messrs. Fleming had brought with them. Immediately after delivering the paper into the possession of their friend, the Messrs. Fieming, or one of the brothers says to Mr. Crosier, ' I am now going to cow-hide you;' and one of the boys, holding a cocked pistol to his head, directed the other to inflict the threatened punishment, which he immediately commenced. He had struck three er fonr blows, when Crosier pulled a dirk-knife from a side pocket, and, passing at the same time his left arm around the neck of thse one who plied the lash, stabbed him in the left breast, and, as quick as thought, withdrew the knife and struck the one wvho held the pistol a back-handed blow which reached, as did the first, to the heart of his victim. Both brotherseroceived their death wounds in less than two secondl, and were both bloody corpses in three minutes after they were si;=ck. The old man had gone out into the hall and locked the -door. and stood uposi the outside with a pistol to keep out assistance. The affair has created an immense excitement here, I assure you. The young man Crosier is under arrest, having surrendered hims lf into custody, and is to undeigo an examination to-morrow The sympathies of the people a re mostly with Crosier. HIe acts and looks the picture of £aipair. He is a young man, some 27 to 30 years old, and unsun,rried. He is said to have been engaged to the lady in quttion, who is at present out of the State. The other parties wore respectable farmers, and two of them, I understattd, mem bers of the church in good standing."

SUICIDB BY STRYCHNINE. On the 30th ult. a most interesting investigation, in a medico-legal point of view, was concluded before Mr. Wakley, coroner for the western division of Middlesex, the inquiry being into the circumstances attending the death of Catherine Powell, a servant aged 37, which resulted from a large dose of strychnine taken by the deceased with a suicidal intention, under the foUowing peculiar and extraordinary circamstanmcs It appeared that the deceased, who had been in the service -prior to herlast situationatl2,Harriugton-square, Hamp. stead-road-of Lord Milford, Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, frequently spoke to her acquaintances of the deadly eflects of strychnine ; said that Lord Milford had been in the habit of using it for poisoning foxes, rats, and other vermin; and that she had seen an animal expire immed;ately after taking a small quantity of it. Although she spoken so lightly of the dangerous qualities of strychnine, it was not sulpposed for a moment that she premeditated self-destruction, for she was a person of a very cheerful disposition and sober habits. On the day of her death she was found by her mistress lying on the floor of the kitehen as if she was in a fit. Mr. Razell, a neighbouring medical gentleman, was immediately sent for, who found that the deceased was quite dead. There was nothing in the appearance of the body at the time to ccount for death-no rigor mnortis such as is believed to follow death by strychnine, with the exception of a strong muscular action in the fingers. On the deceased's box being removed, a bottle of white powder marked " Poison," with the name of the chymist, " Mr. PhiUips, chymist and druggist, Haverfordwest," was discovered, and on Mr. Ha7ell performing the yost mnrtea examination, he found traces of poisoning in the stomach. This led to the adjournment or the inquiry in order that an analysis might be made of the contents of the stomach and bottle. Mr. Hazell, having made this further examination, was enabled to state that the bottle contained a compound of strychnine andFrench chalk, and that the deceased had taken some 12 or 15 grains of the poison, which fully accounted for her death. The Coroner, in summing up, observed that the case was an exceedingly important and extraordinary one. It was generally behevcd that poisoning by strychnine resulted in violent contortions of the hands and convulsions, but here was a case that exploded the whole theory. The deceased,, it appeared, was seen weU at 4 o'clock in the afternoon; at a-unarter to 6 she was found dead; bat there were none of those convulsive actions about the body which usually were seen when death resulted from such a poison. On the contrary, she lay in an easy and recumbent position on the floor, the only thing peculiar being a slight convulsive action in the fingers. In poisoning by strychnine it had invariably occurred that the body was so rigid and contorted and the back so bent that the body could rest on the back of the head and the heeLs, bat it was not the result in the present case. On the whole lie considered the investigation one of the most important brought under his notice for some time past, and trested it would be duly recorded in medical jurisprudence; for besides its important features in a medico-legal point of view, it was reaUy useful to know that a person might die from the effects of strychline, and yet no external trace be left, nor even the slightest injury result to the coats of the sto mach, which was the means of immediate detectionin other poisons. In conclusion, he expressed his belief, from the large quanity found in the deceased's sy.stem, that she had taken it wilfully for the. pUrpOse of destroying life, and he left it with the jury, under the circumstances, to consider the state of her mind at the time shecommitted the suicidal act. The jury, who listened throughout most attentively to the remarkablefacts disclosed, after abrief deliberation recorded a verdict of suicido, leaving the condition of the deceased's mind an open qlestion. The inquiry then terminated.A VEEr OF HoRuRoRS.-The last week of the old year does not appear to have been a very favotrable one for the town of Cardiff - and it is to be hoped that the cominlg of the new year wilf bring with it brighter and more cheerng prospects. In addition to a wreck wvhich happened at Breakca Point, a few miles from the town, on Uonday last, two or three vessels put into the port in a deplorable condition, so much so that it is a wonder any one of them escaped being lost. On Taesday Mr. Underwood, eontfectioner, attempted suicide by cutting his throat, but fortunately did not succeed. On Wednesday, as the schooner Elizabeth was coming into port, the mate deliberately jumped overboard and was drowned, although every endeavour was made to save him. His body has not yet been found, and no cause can be assigaed for the act. On the same day John Gwynn, a labourer, was found dead in his bed. It was at first currently reported and believed that the deceased had been poisoned; but at the inquest this was clearly disproved, lie went to bed about 10 o'clock on the previous night, and slept soundly until about 7 o'clock in the morning, when he told his wife he felt unwell, and asked her to get him a cup of tea. She went downstairs for that purpose, and on returning in about half-anhour she found that her husband had turned round on his side, and in a few minutes he was dead. On the same days an accident of a highly singular nature, and attended lOSS of life, occurred to an Irishwoman named Catherine Mfurphy, aged 44, while she was engaged in stealing coal. The Bute Docks are constantly thronged with Irish people-men, women, and children-who steal anything which comes in their way, principally coal, and who, in many instances, have laid violent hands upon any one who has ventured to interfere with tbem. Many precautions have been adopted by the Taff-vale Railway autborities, but aU to no effect. The coal is tipped into vessels by means of large shoots, and at one end of these are heavy weights, acting as a countorpoise. These weights, on the shoot being emptied, fall into large wooden tranks, at the bottom of which is nailed a strong board. In order to facilitate the stealing of coal it appears the deceased had removed this board, and had placed her head and hani into the trank for the purpose of pulling down the loose coal, and while she was in the act of doing so the weight descended, and not only struck the unhappy creature a terrible blow on the head, but confined her ina the trunk for at least a quarter of an hour. notwithstanding everyoxertion wasusedto exericateher. Whensho wastaken out it waq found that her bead had been literally smashed, and death must have been almost instantaneous. The coroner's jury returned a verdict of " aecidental death." A convict in the county gaol at Cardiff has been guilty of three most atrocious acts. A few days since he attempted to murder one of the warders by striBdng him on the head with a large piece of firewood, which by some means he had concealed in his cell. A day or two afterwards he endeavoured to strangle himself by tying one end of his neckercbief to the bar of the window and pulling the other end tightly, and he was only rescued by the arrval of timely assistance. This, it will be thought, was quite sufficient, but shortly afterwards it was noticed that the prisoner's eyes wore sufferin" from somethin, as if they had been scratched, and the"knowledge of hMr. Evans, the surgeoWto the gaol, was baffled in an endeavour to discover the real cause, until the eyes beconming worse and the sight almost gone the prisoner was searched, and in one of his pockets a very smaU piece of glass was found, with which ho had scratched the papils of the eyes to such an extent as to make it doubtful whether the sight will ever be perfectly restored. On being questioned as to his reason for so atrocious an act the prisoner coolly replied that he did not wLsh to be sent out of the country, Lnd therefore he had endeavoured to destroy his sight. The man's name is Duggan ; he was convicted at the winter assimrs of a burglary on the premises of MIr. Moses, a jeweUler, of Swansea, and, beinSa ticket-of-leave convict, was transported for life. Truly, this mav be termned a week of horrors-at least, half a wieek-for the whole of the occurrences took place before Wednesday noon, and three of them on the last day of the old year.

QUAWTFICATtONXS FOB THE BAIt AS MERI(CA.-The fact that 10 out of 11 applicants foradmission to the bar were rejected by the Board of Examiners at the present term o£ the Supreme Court, has Meated no little sensAtion among the neophytes of that respectable profession. Hitherto, a mere admission to the list of candidates has been equivalent to initiation into the fraternity, honour, and rank of barristers. The examination was purely formal and superficial the questions propoa-ided of the most elemiientary charac. ter; the certificate of fitness inevitable. A plump fee to the clerk secured a square foot of parchment, artistically decorated vwith drapery, hung partly upon the persons of Thalia, Astra,a, and two or three other judicial females grouped at the top, partly upon Corinthian columns at; the side; while at the bottom prevailed the names of their honours, the justices, tbo seal of the Court on cerulean rihand, and the attestation of the very oblging official, whose duty it is to utter .such documents. Armed with these letters of marque, the youne attornev had nothing to do, hut to fit out his snug little privateer of an office, and cruiso in search of professional prey and pay. The idea of Anr familiar acquaintance w,ith the immense cience of law, with even our own revised statutes and code of practice, never seriously impressed itself upon the minds of the learned gentlemen intrusted with the keys of the temple. It was regarded as sufficient to assert the right of tho bar to judeg of the qualifications of its ow-n members, aDd to waive it liberaUy and chrritably in the individual instance. The suddenenforcement of a more rigid test naturally carries dismay to those still in their novitiate. But that the addea rigour is absolutely needed and the Board of Examiners abundantly jnstified in the course pursued a very trilhng reflection will satisfy us. The standard of qualification has certainly been too low. It may be true that more law is learnt by the practitioner from a single case than years of immethodical reading will teach hint and there is plausibility in the inference that the sooner the student is admitted to practise the sooner he will be a competent lawyer. But it is equally true that a single case of amputation, or artery-tying, or tumour cutting, is oE more real value to the young surgeon than long chapters oE Wistar or Cooper on cach topic; and yet do we seriously question the wisdom of turnmg those young brandisbers of scalpel, probe, and lancet loose upon society without firstr ascertaining whother they have a slight preparatory acquaintance with authors upon anatomy and surgery. Property requires the same guarantees M life. There are those who value it higher, and seek in suicide escape from the evil of losing or not having it. What yonr doctor is to the health of your household that the attorney is to its wealth. His ignorance, incompetency, stupidity, may mako you a pauper, expel your wife from her Fifth. avenne palace, and consign your children to soma beneficent bomo for the friendless; may draw down rain upon you and your posterity. There is not, perhaps, a prac. tising lawyer at this bar, not a judge on the bench, who could not tell his tale of suits lost to the righteous side, and fortunes sacrificed through the legal or technical blunders. or the dulness, siowness, negligenoo, and inadequacy oE counseL Not a day pasaes but some beaten client leaves the City Hall cursing his error in selecting a lawyer who, failed to study or mnAter the merits of a simple case, the points of which were obvious even to his unprofessional but more profoundly interested mind; who marshaUed his evidence to the worst advantage, And was completely ambushed, surprised, and queled by the superior tact of oppos, ihg counsel. It is easy to say ho should have chosen his advocate better; but in most cases tho advo to and the cause are first tried at tho same time * and hL'ing no other criterion to judge of his man but the fact of his being a licensed barrister, and avoiding the heavy fee required by xN practitioner of elevated repute. heis obligedto employ counsel on the sole strength of the veltum. The poor and ignorant arm especially liable to decelition, as they havo no means of di. enminating, and look with equal veneration upon aU who lay claim to the rank and dignity of lawyer. As a protection to the public, tberefore, greater conscienco and fidelity is to be demanded of these gaugers and endorsors of legal competency; and wo trust they wil be supported in their present praiseworthy position by the authority of the bench. Of tho advantage of a more rigorous standard tn the profession itself there will be no question. It is an act; ofecharity to 2.4000f thae 2,500 practitioners at the bar in thin city to dam the swellinF tide of recruits. It is an act oC stiU higber moeit to discourAge the thousanda of inexpel 3ienced and sangninc youths who, tuming their backs upolX an honourrble pursuit, mercantile or mechanical, resolvo to waste aL valuable life in profitless wandering among tha delightful and flowery fictions of the law. It wi be a fair test of tho dood labour, patienoe, and pecuniary tnduranco eftuhftur lwyer to exact more labourand more pationco from the candidate; andwvo shall bo strengthened to mingle congratulations with our pity for thoso who, discouageod by. the elevated barrier, resign the hopeless chances of nivaling the Weusters, Bmnc5ys, and Choates of the American bar. Let the examiners by all means persist in their innovation5 - .ZV'c York 22mf-.
