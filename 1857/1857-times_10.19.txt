MANC2EISTER BXEIBITION OF ART I TREASURES. On Saturday the Art-Treasures Exbibition, which has excitedthe envyof Londoners and the amazement of foreigners, and which, for this year at least, ha? quite rivalled the attractions of the capital, wvai closed for ever. As we have already stated %vould ba the case no ceremonial marked the final proceedings, and there was nothing but the hearty cheers with which the concourse of visitors quitted the buil1ding to distinguish it from any other dav. The public of Manchester seemed scarcely able to credit the fact that an Exhibition which has occupied so large a share of the attention of the kingdom, and whiclh has been so original in idea aud successful in execution, could possibly be closed without some striking ceremonial of some kind. This notion, coupled with the anxious wish that it should remaia open for another week, led many to believe that at least a few days extra would be granted. It was not indeed until Saturday morning that the last of these hopes died out, and visitors prepared to take their farewell of the building and its noble contents. As the day was very fine the number of visitors was sufficiently great to prevent anything like a view being obtained of the works of art, and people sat themselves down where they could, waiting in the vague hope of something turning up to make the closing an impressive scene. Of course the majority of the visitors were season-ticket holders though, nevertheless, nearly 9,000 paid at the doors. The only alteration from the usual everyday arrangements was in a large and tasteftul trophy of banners being erected at the end of the building over the orchestra, and the orchestra itself being strengthened by the addition of the band of the S3thRegimentand the 4thDragoonGuards. Aidedby this addition to the fine band always in the building a series of overtures and marches were beautifuly rendered, and the crowd which thronged every part of the place, after a few vain attempts to study the pictures, were compelled to remain quiet and listen to the music whether they liked it or not. In this way the day passed without variation or incident untilt half-past 4 'clock, when the bands gave the signal that the last hour of the Exhibition had commenced by playing the national anthem. Imimediatelyall thegentlemenpresent respectfully uncovered, and a simultaneous movement was made frorm all parts of the building towards the orchestra, round which the visitors coUected in a dense mass, listening to the band with a serious and marked attention, that had a striking and almost solemn effect. As the music ceased to re-echo through the building there was a moment's pause of expectation, and Mr. WiUiam Fairbairn, the Chairman of the executive committee, advancing to an open space in front of the orchestra, amid deep silence, closed the Exhibition In these words:- " ladies and Gentlemen,-The time has coma when it is my duty to pronounce the last few words of farewvell, and to inform you that when you have all retired from this building the Exhibition of Art Treasures will be at an end for ever. I sincerely hope that you will never forget the liberality which has enabled that Exhibition to be formed (loud cheers), and that the recollection of this building and the unrivalled Art Treasures It contained will assert among you the truth of the poet's line- " 'A thing of beauty Is a joy for eTer. Scarcely had Mr. Fairbairn ceased speaking when, moved by an involuntary impulse, a tremendous peal of cheering arose fror all parts of the building. It was renewed again and again-sometimes for the executive committee e2z masse, sometimes for Mr. Fairbairn-sometimes for Mr. Deane, the General Commissioner,but always hearty-always warm and general, and accompanied by such an enthusiastlc waving of hsts and handk-erchiefs as would have moved the most impassive. The united bands, too, seemed carried away by the same fervour, and gave vent to their feelings in another grand repetition of the national anthem. But when this was cver, prodigal of applause as if they had never cheered before, the shouts of enthusiasm and farewell broke out as loud as ever. Suddenly they ceased, and the crowd made a general set towards the place of exit, which nevertheless very few went out of, but, as if loth to quit the building for ever, almost as suddenly came back again, wandering about the wide saloons and casting long lingering glances on the great collection which none could hope to see again assembled at least in Manchester. Then, after a few fluctuations, the great tide of visitors set steadlly out. For a time the current flowed evenly enough, but some 3,000 or 4,000 visitors displayed such an anxious desire to be she last to quit the building that, in order to prevent a trial of patience which might have proved too much even for the patience of those " much enduring men" the executive committee, it was necessary to prevent those who had once left from again returning. Thus slowly the great mass was edged towards the door amid continued outbursts of cheering for the executive committee, Mr. Fairbairn, and Mz. Deane, until the last of the 1,300,000 who inall have visited the Exhibitionwere fairly out, and either lost among the humble crowd who cheaply gratified their artistic longings from the outside, or were cared off a prey to the numerous rapacious cabs and busses which lurked at every corner; and so, as darkness fell, the Exhibition was left deserted and alone. The members of the executive committee were the last to quit, and the building was given up to a row of nighz police, who stole away in soft list slippers, flitting about from place to place. Soon these, too, were dispersed in watchful silence throughout the long galleries. Sometimes the eye lost them as they crept away against the dark background of paintings, and then again were dimly seen passino the groups of white statuary-hoverincg round the cases of goldsmith's work or standing motionless among thegaunt suitsof armour. But whereever they were-and they seemed pretty weU to be all over the building-though never failing in their watchfulness no sound gave token of their presence, and the visitor peering dimly through the long array of dark saloons could scarcely believe, amid the oppressive silence, that almost every spot vwsa closely watched by many men. Thus, then, the Manchester Exhibition of Art Treasures was finally closed after a brilliant and famous career, which, though not long in point of time, has at least sufficed to achieve for itself a most marked success, and even to raise our artistic statu's as a nation in the eyes of Europe. When we say that the Exhibition has been suecessful, we do not mean only that it has been a source of deep attraction to all classes, but that even judging it by that most difficult of aU standards-that of financial success-its triumph is not less marked. It is, we believe, the only great public exhibition, whether national or local, which, since the Great Exhibition of la51, has thriven in a pecuniary point of view, and found itself, after paying aU expenses, still left with a balance in hand. The marvellous surplus which the Great Exhibition closed with is known to all our readers. The Dublin Exhibition, which immediately followed, was a conspicuous failure in this respect; that which took place at New York was not only a failure, but a gross imposition as well; while that of Paris in 1855, though one of the greatest and most brilliant of them all in some respects, nevertheless fell shoit of its expenses by a sum almost larger in amount than the surplus which was yielded by our own in Hyde Park. So far, then, as this species of success is concerned (and it is, after all. the safest general standard), the Exhibition which has just closed at Manchester can only be compared with that of 1851. But, apart from the difficulty of instituting a comparison between a great effort of the whole British empire with the results of a provincial movement, there are many circumstances connected with the monster gathering of 1851 which would make such a comparison peculiarly unjust to the Art Treasures display of Manchester. For instance, the Great Exhibition started with a fund in hand amounting to 100,0001. sterling, of which suim upwards of 60,0001. was raised by public subscription throughout the country. In addition to this great aid, the ground occupied by the building was held free from all rent or charge of any kind, and every single article was forwarded and removed by the exhibitors at their own expense, and insured at their own cost, and, above all, the Exhibition itself was held in London. The Manchester Exhibition had not one of these advantages. It had no fund in hand to start with, it paid rent for the ground on which it stood, and all the expenses connected with bringing to and removing from the building its rare colection are defrayed out of the general receipts. Over and above aU these drawbacks, it has had to pay insiurance on the articles contributed, and when we consider their extremelyperishable nature, and thatthe market value of thl whole collection amounts to the enormous sum of 5,980,0 JO. sterling, the disadvantages against which it had to struggle towards pecuniary success must be evident to all. Nevertheless, in spite of these obstacles, in spite of the lukewarmness of n *ny who should have been its tirnm friends, and the ill-concealed hostility of others lavish in their predictions of the loss it would occasion to all concerned, it has been pre-eminently successful, and after all expenses have been defrayt d a handsome balance will stiU remain in hand. The total number of visitors since the opening has been 1,335,000, and the number of visitors who have paid at the doors in aU clays amounts to -1,060,000. The sale of I season tickets has realized the respectable sum of | 23,0001. When to these items are added the profits I on the sale of catalogues (of which upwards of 150,000 have been sold), on the umbrela and walking stick departments, and other sources, we believe the total sum standing to the credit of the executive committee wiU amount to a few pounds over a hundred thousand. The gross outlay, including every possible item and the cost of the safe return of the most minute article contributed, we believe will amount to 104,0001. To meet this 4,0001. more than is at present in hand there remains the building, with the whole of its handsome fixtures. This is by some expected to realize 18,0001., by others 15,0001. ; but, even supposing it only to bring the last named sum, there is little doubt that 10,0001. wiU remain after all expenses to the credit of the executive committee. It was at one time suggested among other plans that the building should be allowed to stand for one twelvemonth more, and that the forthcoming year should be celebrated in Manchester by a grand industrial exposition in the place which the Art Treasures stiU occupy. Whether the undertaking would have been a successful one is a matter of considerable doubt, though the railway companies, with whom it is said the idea originated, would certainly have had the profit, whoever else might lose. But as the ground on which the Exhibition stood is only rented from Sir Humphrey de Trafford up to the end of the present month, the plan for the continuance of the building for another year was duily submitted and referred by Sir Humphrey for the approval of his tenantry in the neighbourhood of Old Trafford-a place not widely known to some, though, nevertheless, the suburb in which the Exhibition stands. This reference to the feelings of the inhabitants afforded an opportunity of vindicating the district from the intrusion of future exhibitions, whether artistic or industrial, which was not to be lost. Accordingly a meeting was convened by circular, and,as the local papers inform us, the " inhabitants" mustered an attendance to thenumberofthirty-th,ree. At thismonstergathering it was movedby aRav. T. Buckley,seconded, by a Mr. Redfern, and carried by a majority of 17 to 13, " That the continuance of an Exhibition in the building occupied by the Art Treasures Exhibition would be objectionable to the inhabitants of Old Trafford at this meeting assembled." " WVe, the people of England," said the celebrated memorial of the three tailors, in Tooley-street assembled, and the Old Trafford obstructives must have had this facetious precedent steadily in view when they arrived at the laconic decision we have just quoted. But, now that the Exhibition is definitely closed, the inhabitants may safely be left to find their own dull level. and to carp in their obscurity at a noble scheme which has made their city the envy of the metropolis aud the talk of Europe. The toil, the patience, the enduring self-denial which the executive committee have undergone in order to pro- duce such results will, we fear, never be pro- I perly appreciated, for they are never likely to be truly known. Some have passed two, three, and all two anxious years of almost unremitting labour in arranging and bringing to perfection the Exhibition which on Saturday was closed, and to the success of which they not only devoted themselves and their time, but a fair share of their money also. Some idea of their labours may be gathered from the fact that, from first to last, they have held no fewer than 300 business meetings, of which the minutes are regularly recorded. lVhen all have so distinguished themselves, and when the only contest has been who could do most lto advance the common object, it is perhaps invidious to mention any; but to none would it be more painful than to the members of the executive committee themselves if we omitted our meed of praise to their chairman-to the originator of the whole scheme, to the main contributor to its success-Mr. Wiliam Fairbairn. To those at all acquainted with the details of the Exhibition it is unnecessary to do more than mention the name of Mr. Deane, its indefatigable general commissioner, whom al unite to praise. His labours are now termi- nated well and honourably, and they must long' be gratefully remembered in Manchester. It reflects not a little credit on that city aud the populous districts around it that, although 1,300,000 persons of all classes have visited the building, not one single instance has occurred of wanton damage having been committed, and, except in the trifling case to which we referred on Friday, there has only been one breakage by accident. This fact needs no comment. In a few days more the whole of the magnificent collection will be in process of swaddling up and stowsing away in hideous packingcases of every shape and size. Within two months the building will be cleared of everything. Fortunately advantage has been taken of the occasion of their being together to perpetuate by photography the chief works of a collection which the public can scarcely hope to see again. In the great work in course of publication by Messrs. Colnaghi and Agnew the clefs d'a'vre of the Exhibition were placed before the gaze of thousands, and the long doubted point as to how far photogrzaphy could be applied to the reproduction of the works of the ancient masters haa been set at rest. The difficulty of varied colours has been overcome, and the most delicate tints of light and shade have been copied with a beauty and softness of outline which are almostmarvellous. During the last few months exquisite photographs have been taken of the principal pictures at the Manchester Exhibition, which, at the commencement of the present year, it was generaly believed among photog,raphers that it was impossible to copy in a recognizable manner. An official statistical account of the whole Exhibition, containing al the details of the plan from its first conception to the termination on Saturday, will also be published in the course of a few weeks.
NARROW ESCA1'B FROm DRowRNrG.-A correspondent writes as follows :-" The steamer Clansman left Stornoway on Monday, at half-past 12 o'clock p.m., with the intention of landing Lord Saltoun and Lady Saltoun, besides other four of their party, at Balmacarra. The steamer arrived there at S o'clock in the evening, but was unable to land them, on account of the storm which was blowing in upon the shore, or rather upon the rocks. The steamer then got started again and proceeded to 7yleakin, the captain expecting to be able to land them there. The steamer reached that place about half-past 8, by which time it was quite dark, with a strong gale of wind and rain. The steamer's bell was then rung, when the ferryman came offin David Hutcheson and Co.'s large boat to the steamer. The passengers and luggage were all got safely on board the cargo boat, and the steamer then backed out to anchor, leaving the boat to pull to the snore, the wind at the time blowing off the shore, besides the tide running out to sea at about sLx or seven miles per hour. The boat appeared to keep her ground for a short time, when those on board were obliged to give up the struggle and allow her to go as the wind and tide drove her. In a very short time she was across the sound, and to those on board the steamer it appeared that they had struck the rocks on the other side, as the lamp on board the boat was seen to go out. By this time another boat had been sent off from the Clansmnan to assist them, when it likewLse disappeared among the rocks. Another boat was then sent to see if they could learn what had become of the other two boats, which likowise did not return. The steamer's lifeboat was then lowered and manned, and sent to try and find out what became of the others, when she made a round turn along the land for some distance and came back to the stern of the btea!ner and reported that it was impossible for them to land on account of the surf that was running at the time. She was then sent away again, to go further along the land, to the place where the other boats had beein seen Last but she was only a short time away when the first boa; from the steamer returned, and told that ,vhen they reached the cargo boat she was s:tti:;g ::pon a lock some distance from the shore. They then atiempted t-- tow her off, but were not able, as part of the men in the c(r.-o boat jumped into the steamer's boat, when a quarrel en ucd between the men mu the two boats, tSo wind amid tw'e in the meantime driving them both over the rocks into a small sound or gully, between two islands, wvhen they managed to get landed, Lady Saltoun's maid having to get into the water to the middle. Of course, between rain and salt water, the whole party were drenched to the skin, in which condition they had to remain for about three hours on an uninhabited island, without any shelter whatever, when they were all saf,ly ferried over to Kyleakin in the steamer's lifeboat ; after which the steamer proceeded to Portree. The steamer lay about two hours in Pertree, and then left at 4 o'clock, proceeding on her usual course, when she a-ain lifted the same party at Kyleakin about S in the morn5mg. I understand that Lord Saltoun gave 201. to be divided among aU hands for their exertions on hii behalf."-GlasV1ow
MUTINY IN INDIA.-THB RELIEF FUND. The following letter has been addressed by the Due d'Aumale to General Peel:- " Twickenbam, Oct. 14. "My dear General Peel,-I have been Informed that a meeting will be held to-morrow at Twickenham, under your presidency, for the purpose of raising a subscription for the relief of the sufferers by the Indian mutiny. " Full of gratitude for the hospitality which I have received in England, and sympathizing heartily with those of your compatriots who are so gallantly fighting in Indis, send you my contribution to the above fund, and remain "Yours truly, "H H. D'ORLEPANS." CLEBRKENWELL. The contributions to the relief fund in this parish have reached a total of 4061. ISLINGTON. In this district of the metropolis the contributions to the relief fund have reached the amount of 2,0001., which in. cludes 8001. collected on the day of humiliation. The Rev. Daniel Wilson, vicar of St. Mary's, and son of the Bishop of Calcutta, is chairman of the Islington branch committee, of which several of the local clergy are members. BISHOP AUCKLAND (DURHAM). A meeting was held at this place on Wednesdy the Bishop of Durham in the chair. Resolutions expressing sympathy with our felow-country. men in India and the propriety of raising a local subscrin. tion for their relief were moved and seconded by Sir W. Eden, the Rev. J. lManisty, Mr. H. Stobart, and Mr. Bowser, and agreed to unanimously. A committee was appointed ta carry the resolutions into effect. In acknowledging a vote of thanks for presiding at the meeting the Biehop of DL-mHAm said he had seldom taken the chair at a meetmg with greater pleasure than he did on that occasion, not only because it was the first time he had done so in Bishop Auckland, but also that he had a desire that such influence as he possessed might be used to assist objects like that they were met to aid. He did not desire to be a grand prince and potentate within the adjoining castle, but heartily wished to rome among them and identify himself with them, and join in a their sympathies and desires to aid and succour a work of charity and goodwilL (Applause.) He believed that under God's providence the crisis through which India was passing would be productive of advantage to that country. England would now be more deeply sensible than before of its own shortcomings, and could not fail to see that the punishment which bad been inrdicted had resulted from a want of Christianizing influence, which onght to have been more widely spread. There was a wide distinction between toleratlng a superstitious religion and absolutely dis. couragin an attempt to introduce a true religion into India. (eneral Havelockhad attributed his successes to the God of battles, and while their generals appealed to a higher power, and attributed their suecess to God'sprovidence, they at home ought to be deeply thankful and antiapate the results which they hoped would now be realized. EASTERN COUNTIES. The subscriptions continue to increase in the eastern counX ties In an extraordinary manner.

STOITrRB RID GE A public meeting has been held here to take measures on behalf of our suffering fellow-countrymen in India MIr. J. H. HI. Foley, ALP., who occupied the chair, said be would not go into the question how a email country like England had acquired dominion over so large and so distant a territory as India, nor whether, having gained such a possession, it had been wisely and justly governed. The events of the past were matters to be recorded by the historian, while, with respect to the future, it would be the duty of Parliament to consider how we may best profit by our errors and governI ndSa so as to gain the affections of the people and make them faithful and loyal subjects of the Crown. The meeting wras addressed by Mfr. W. 0. Foster, 31P.>. the Rev. C. H. Crawford, Mr. J. Y. Lee, and Mr. W. B.1 Corns.

Boor, HAwI G I2- TIE RutRAl DISTRICIS.- The Bishop of Norwich presided on Saturday at a meeting held in the Assembly-rooms in that city, to receive the annual report of the Diocesan Society for Promoting Book Hawking in the Rural Districts. Among those present were Sir Willoughby Jones, Bart., Sir J. Boileau, Bart, the oen. Archdeacon Bouverle, the Ven. Archdeacon Han. kinson, and other clergymen and gentlemen. After a few observations from the Bishop, one of the secretaries read a very lengthy report from the committee, which stated that tho count7 of Norfolk had been divided for the purposes of the association into four districts, in which five hawkers or colporteurslaboured among a population of 326,061. The sales had been :-In the north-eastern district 800 Bibles and testaments, 1,100 church services and prayer-books, and 5,100 other books and tracts; in the south-eastern districb 526 Bibles and testaments, 17 0 church services and prayerbooks, and 3,725 other books and tracts ; in the northwestern district 422 Bibles and testaments, 319 prayerbooks and church services, and 4,475 other books and tracts; in the south-western districts 744 Bibles and testaments624 prayer-books and church services, and 4,584 other books and tracts, making a gross total of 2S:,37U.

A great many of the sales effected had beent made with domestic servants and laboureres The report was adopted unanimously, and several gentlemen afterwards adcressed the meeting. THE OVERLAND ArSTRALIA.\ MAIL.-Many of our contemporaries Seem to anticipate the early receipt of an overland mail from Australia ; in fact, that the August mail will come forward in due course. This Is a misconception of the arrangements determined upon in the colonies. The next intelligence, r-id Alexandria and Marseilles, will not arrive untl Novemher 2, as it was resolved that no steamer should be despatebed to Suez during August, but that the September mail would be duly forwarded from Sydney on the 11th and from Melbourne on the 15th, and thenceforth, it was expected, there would be no further interruption to the regular monthly service. The arrival of the Royal Charter is equlvalent to an August mall, as she left the middle of that month, and has made the voyage in the rapid space of 63 days.-fining Jouriwo, Oct. 17.

MONEY-MARKETan, GCI1YINTELLIGEICB. Saturday Evening. The revival of confidence in the stock and money markets continues, although great sensitiveness is otIl observable. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 88i to 9, opened steadily at 88s to 1, and, in consequence of sonme purchases by persons *bho have receiatly been operating for a fall, coupled with numerous further investments on the part of the public, an uninterrupted advance took place to 89*. Towards the afternoon, however, a change of tone was produced by a sale of more than 250,0001. Consols, partly for delivery ou Tuesday, and partly for the account, and a react.on occurred to 884 to :., which wMr s the last quotatlon. For the lf,th of November the closing price was SS{, to 89. Dluring the morning the Government broker bought 10,0001. Reduced and 10,0001. Exchequer-bils for national accounts. Bank Stock left off at 211 to 213; Reduced, 871 to 88; New Three per Cents., 87 to 88; India Stock, 20f) to 209 ; and India Bonds, 30s. to 20s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 8s. to 4s. discount. Ut' to the close of business there was no tidings of the Ariel from New York. Her advices, therefore, will most probably be superseded by those by the Europa, which will bring dates five days ilater than the Ariel-namely, from Boston to the 7th of October, and from New York, vid Halifax, to tthe 9th. In the Stock-Exchange to-day money was obtainable for short periods on Government securities at bi per cent. At the Bank and in the discountmarket, although full rates were freely paid, there was nothing unsatisfactory in the character of the demand. In the foreign stock-market the principal movements were in Turkish, which advanced durino the day, buit after official hours closed heavily. Mexslcaa were negotiated for the account at 19a and i; Spanish New Deferred, for the account, 25 ; ditto, Passive, 0; Turkish Six per Cents., 881; for the account, 88A and -; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 98 and A; and for the account, 98%. The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 5c. for money and G7f. 20c. for the end of the month, showing a recovery of nearly a quarter per cent. At V-ienna and Amsterdam, also, the markets have been slightly less weak. At Hamburg the rate of discount has advanced to 9i per cent. lhe West India mail steamer MIagdalena to-day has brought 1 r70,0001., of which 75,0001. is gold and the remainder silver. The gold shipped to New York to-day by the Persia was 239,4561. The 360,0001. brought by the Royal Charter from Australia will be dclivered in London on Monday morning. The Avon and the Heatherbell sailed from Melbourne on the I10th of August for England; the former with 51 ,(100oz. of gold, and the latter with 20,CO0oz. They are now 08 days out. The suspension has been announced of Messrs. WVhan, M'Lean, and Co., of Glasgow, and of Hamilton, Canada. The Glasgow papers mention the resignation of the manager of the Western Bank of Scot]and. The precise amount of specie to be taken out on the 20th by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Indus is 778,7681., of which 712,6841. is for India, 02,7541. for China and the Straits, and 3,3301. for Aden. The greater portion of this sum is silver, the gold 1being about °38,0001., principally for India. In the thick of its evils there will be little profit in moralizing on the American panic. One piece of instruction, however, should be noticed while it is fresh. Apart from the incurables of the Birmingham sclool, there has long been a set of currency theorists who, while recognizing the doctrine of convertibility, have opposed the Bank Charter Act oa tbe ground that where this doctrine is enforced no restrictions are necessary to guard against redundant 3ssues. According to their view, the idea of providing by law for a contraction of the note circulation in proportion as bullion is withdrawn from the country is simply absurd, since the pubhc, who are the best judges of tbeirown wants, will perform that operation for themselves. They will take, it is argued, as muich bullion as they need, and this can he procured only by sending in notes for paymeent. The fact that it is possible for the banks to delay making provision for these demands until the exigency is such as to cause a panic and a conseq^uent rush for the purposes of hoarding-in the face of which no bank can sustain itself-is always lost sight of. But we have now, hi the case of the Philadelphia and Baltimore banks, and even in that of the New York and Boston establishments, although the latter have thus far escaped from tinal disaster, a perfect illustration of the insufficiency of the mere theory of convertibility to secure the advantages claimed for it. The note cLrculation of all these banks was payable on demand to bearer. A foreign drain had been going oll for some time, and its rapid increase was iniminent. But while their notes were being sent in for gold they persevcringly re-issued them in the shape of discounts or advances on bonds and stock. Of course, the dogma that with a convertible currrency it is impossible to maintain an over-issueproved tri e, but the demonstration was not attained until too late. In proportion as they persisted in abstainfing from a contraction of their circulation, thus preventing a fall in prices that would have checked the importations of foreign goods, that circulation came back upon them with increased rapidity, and it wvas not until they found their stock of specie becoming exhausted that they resorted to measures of self-preservation. The work of contraction then fell liion the public with a sudden shock. Alarm becane universal. Houses that in the absence of warning cf any approaching restriction of accomnmodation had relied llpon obtaining the usual advances wvent down one after anothel? heavily i^ debt to the banks that had misled them: the general credit of the banks was thus assailed note-holders rushed for specie not because they wanted it, bnut fr nm fe .r that in another hour they might not get it, and forthwith came an announcement cf suanension. This, at least, was the case at Baltiiiore and Philadelphia. At New York aud Boston the position had been rather less untoiinl, and the securities hold by the banks and their general Bvztbmi of adminiistrationi were of a better character. I:ut here, althoigh the banks saved themselves, the mercantile suiliri-iigswere no less deadly. Indeed, it may be qiuestioned if, owing to the sacrifices conse(illellt, iipOII the protracted strungle of the banks, after the domestic inn had commenced, to prevent their own stoppage at any cost to their customers, the private losses at these places will not in the end prove to have been the most severe. In either instance the lesson is alike conclusive, and can hardly fail to convert that section of the opponents of our currency laws wh.- profess to be guided by any tangible principle. U pon the class who fancy it is in the power of (iovernments or banks to enable pecple to pay debts by siniply promising to pay them it is needle&s to seek to operate. Although England at the present moment presents in the midst of the Indian mutiny and her American losses an example of 'nancial steadiness to thewhole world, there is probably not one of these persons but would be prepared with the monotonous pertinacity^eculiar + u th^itr topoe 4 nany b o to thei:r state to prove, in any n~umber -o'f lIe`tter-s pampblets, or Parliamentary examinations, that the charge now exacted by the Bank of England for money is simply the penalty of a perverse neglect of some infallible and self-evident nostrum that would enable us to secure at any moment a " sufficent" and never-failing supply at the agreeable rate of 3 per cent. The ralilvay intoiliggence this week is of an unimportant character. The report of the Pernambuco states that the first section of the line will probably be opened on the 2d of December, the birthday of the Emperor of Brazil. The rorng stock and otler requisites for working the traific are n perfect condi*ion. Prog_ress is being nmade in the constructionof the other sections of the railway. The Copiapo Extension Company have obtainied from the Clhilian Goveeminent a conc- -scion embodyizjg all the privileges and exciluptiems icmnirmd. A provisional contract has beell eitc r-,d into for tlie constrUction and eflmnj,ulit or the road. The Copiapo and Caldera Ratlv.ay, of vwhich the new uindertaking forms a portif ni, is stated to pay regular dividendls at the rate of 'rom 14 to liper cent. At a meeting of the Prcstoi and Longridge a dividend was declared at the rnto of os. 8d. per share.

RO IRESTER, OCT. 17. Farmers are very busy In all kinds of outdoor operations, which have been pushed forwsrd with mush spirit during the past few weeks. The rapidly deecending preces have not deterred farmers from tbra.shuin out a great quantity of wheat and bringing i; to market. Notwithstanding the unusually large breadth of potatoes planted, the crop will be very deficient, the dicease having manifested Itself In nearly al the districts In this portIon of the county. The price has rlsen from £8 to £15 per ton, and even that agwer wll' be exceeded. The heavy fall in priees at Matk-lane has had its effect on all the markets of this district, and prices have undergone a further relaction of 23 per quarter, with trade In a mcat languid and depreesed cmlllion, traneactiona being of merely retal character. At this cam-exchange thare was a ful attendance ot the town and cointry trade, and a liberal quantity of wheat brought forward but milers purchased bat sparingly even at the reduction unwillingly con. ceded by the farmers. The following were the quotations at the cla.- of the market :-Whlte vvheat, new, 541. to 58s.; extraG 60b. new red, EOs. to 54s.; estra, 5S3.:; old whte, 62.s.: old red. 5Si. malting barley, 440. to 4Sa.; grinding ditto, 36a. to 4Ca.; oats, 23Is to 2e. : beans, 363. to 42e. ; pe3As 4 s to 45. per qutster.

From .ome diltricts reports of the turnlps are very unfavoarable, bat the srangoldwmu-'zel and swedes are generally believed to be In good con. dition and a large yield. This was the oldlhicbaelmzs market,and there was an unusually large number of farmers here. Wheat vaa in very good suppll, and Fome lote of exceedinglY fine qusJity were on offer. An unwillingneeR an the part of holders t3 accent the reduced terms offered by mealmen made trade to rule dull. The choice lois of wheat fetched from G6S. to 66s.; ;best orlInary white, 60s. to 63a:. secondary, 553. to Grs. inferior, 49s. to 552. Beetqualties of red wheat sold at 55s. to G6,; recondary, 52s. to 553.: and inferior, 47s. to 64s. Malting barley apreared to be in sho)rt aupply, and the attendanco of dealers being large theoe vwas a brisk business at fuy lato currencies. The distling and grinding decriptions were a better show, but thero was little enimation in trade, and It was only when seUers were disposed to ac. cept a reduct.on of Is. per quarter that purchasers oould be found. Onr quotations ar s 3 follows:-Molting barley, 445. to 483. ; distilling, 35, to 42s.; grinding, 3is. to 336, The bee sorts of oats commanded readyattentiOunat the late highest figures, but Inferior parcels wers heavy in disposal, and certainly much easier to buy than previouslyBeet roland oas were sold at 2SB. to 3Vs.; new Poland, 26s. to 234.: best Tartary, 21s. to 23s., and new, 23s. to 26s. Prime old beans were Is. dearer. and were quoted at 483. to 52s, while the new were marked St 42s. to 434. But little inquiry for peas, which realized from 42s to 45s. The floiur tradb has not undergone any variation. Prices:-Hlouce. bolds, 46s.: eeconds, 421. per eack. A gradual decline in the staple article of wheat has been observable in the country markets this week. On Monday, at Abingdon, trade was dull at a deoline of Is. to-Is. On Tuesday. at Alton, there was an Inactivity in business, and prices were In favour of the buyer. On Wednesday, at Bns3ngstoke, there was a fair supply of wheat, and to effect sales a reduction 012s. had to be submitted to. At Hungerford on the same day, there wa3 a fall market, trade dullsand prices Is. lowerAt Wantage, on that day, last week's prices could not be maintained.

OXFORD, Ocr. 17. A full attendsnceeat market to-daY, and a very large quantIty or wheat showing; but to effect sales farmers were compelled to submit to a reduction of from la. to 2s. Der quarter. The supply of barley was great, witli a corresponding demand, and consequently the trans. actions wvere of an extenilve character, at from 363. to 46d. per quarter. alats worea complete drug on the market.

BAILVAY AND MINING SHARES. Saturday Evening. In the railway-market a general advance took p]ace during the day, but after regular hours there i as a relapse in sympathy with the fuuds ; the marl;et, however, clused rather better than yesterday. Caledonians and London and North-Western exceptionally show a reduction. East Indian description generally improved; Grand Trunk of Canada were also higher, but in Great Western of Canada there was more weakness. In French shares the business was limited, and prices, on the whole, remain without alteration; Dutch Rhenish, Pernambuco, Norwegian, and Lombardo-Venetian were slightly higher. Great Luxembourg, on the other hand, receded. A further improvement occurred in Illinois Central. The transactions in mines havo been ununportant, the only variation being a decline in East Basset. Joint-stock banks were quiet, and Oriental advanced 1ls. In miscellaneous secujities there was an improvement in Electric Telegiaph and London General Omnibus; the latter stock continues in active demand to close speculative accounts.

RAILWVAY IIVTELLIGENCE. -D R A NV ELLS A ND FA KFxTTr A r The Government inspector passed over this line on Thursday, and the opening, it is anticipated, will take place in a few days. EAST SUFFOLK. A large party, comprising representatives of many of the leading families in Suffolk, made an experimental trip last week over portions of the works on this line between Woodbridge and Saxnundham. From Campsey Aske to Saxmnundham the company were conveyed by a locomotive, and they were also drawn by the same means over the Snapa branch, which is about a mile and a-half in length. The proceedings of the day were closed vith a cold co tion. e HAWICK AND CARLISLE. cA very ative contest is now going on in Roxburgh, Dmnfines, and neighbouring counties between the promoters of the rival Hlawick and Carlisle schemes, which are to be submitted to Parliament in the next session. One Is promoted by the Caledonian Company, supported by the Dake df Buccleuch, the line to be by Langholm and Canobie ; and the other, for a line through Liddesdale, is promioted by the North British Railway Company. Meetings have been held in both interests in various towns likely to be affected by the proposed line, and all the municipal, agricultural, and other corporations of the district are being most assiduously canvassed on both sides for their support. It seems generaUy admitted that the tlme has come for the construction of a line tbrough the Cheviots to connect Roxharght with Damfriessbire and Cumberland; and the only question is whether the Caledonian, which possesses the line at the Carlisle end, or the North British, which possesses a line from Edinburgh to E[avrick, constructed in the hope of its being ultimately extended to Carlisle, will obtain the sanction of Parliament. ST. ANDREW'S. The half-yearly meeting of the proprietors of this short line was held on Wednesday at St. Andrew's, when the report, an abstract of which has appeared In Thc Timnr, was adopted, and a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. perannum was declared.

LONDON, MORDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1857. It is a strange thing that the foreign crities of England should never reflect that rancour and invective are looked upon by the world aa the weapons with wbich mediocrity is accustomed to attack greatness. So well is this understood that it adds somewhat to a statesman's prestige that he is the mark for the arrows of a disappointed faction, and yet passes on his way, disdainful of his assailants. We in this country, with the good sense which the practice of affairs gives us, are too wise, if not too proud, openly to show our grudges and antipathies. No man with any self-respect, or even with common prudence, would carp at the reputation or exhibit his anger at the successe of his rival. Instinct tells him that he would only draw derision on himself, while he swelled the triumph of the man whose good fortune he envied. But the continental press and its readers are for the moet part forgetful of tbis decorous reserve. The outbreak in India and the presumed fall of the British dominion in the East have been too much for them. While the English people can see with dignified calmness the prosperity or the reverses of their neighbours, and would be deterred even by pride from seeming to gloat over their temporary embarrassmenta, the organs of such public opinion as remains on the Continent make no attempt to conceal their pleasure at the massacre of our officers and the anarchy which reigns in one of the provinces of our emrpire. Never rmight an Englishman feel more justly proud of the moral superiority of his race than when he sees how low his foreign rivals will stoop to express the jealousy which its successes inspire. It is certainly not to be denied that certain journals have declared their horror at the atrocities of the Sepoys, their sympathy with the alaughtered women and cliidren, and their hope that peace may be restored. We will go further, and state our belief that in cvory country in Europe s minority of educated, thinking, and high principled men fully sympathize w ith tho Eng1lish people, render due tribute to tlhoir (Government, and see in the restoration of their authority the triurmph of civilization and the best hope for the future. Neither in France nor in Germany, neither in the press nor in society, (lo these sentiments Jack expression, and we may at once record our acknowledgments to those wlah9m neither national Ugr politiWl differenees prevent from doing justice where it is due. But it wrould be affectation to pretend that on the Continent the embarrassments of this country have been seen with displeasur. Indeed, the French journals which venture to say a few words in our defence are obliged to apologize to their readers for runnh.g counter to the public feeling, and openly acknowledge that the total destruction of the British power has been anticipated with satisfaction as the result of the late events. Of course, the common sense of mankind prevents more than a few from joining in the extravagances of the Univers and the Gazette de France, but still the fact is undoubted that, so far as public feeling can be discovered and interpreted by the prcss, we are very far from having the good wishes of the French people. In Germany it would seem that opinions have been more divided. The great nation which followis out with such energy every path of knowledge is not likely to have neglected one of the greatest episodes of modem history. The conquest of India will appear to the impartial student as an event full of hope for mankind, and as a step towards that union and regeneration of the world which both religion and philosopby lead us to expect. The Germans, again, divided into many States, and with no thought of material aggrandizement, can see without any pang of jealousy the extended empire of a people which still retains something of kinshiD with them. Thus, we might expect that from the Liberal party in Germany England would receive sympathy and goodwilL This we believe to be the case. As far as can be judged from the tone of the press, the British Government is at present exposed only to its ordinary assailants, the partisans of despotic rule and the enemies of constitutional forms. The German invectives expres a political, not a national dislike; in France the ill feeling is both national and political. This is certainly what might have been expected. It is impossible that an island like ours could build up an empire extending over all the five divisions of the earth, and containing 220,000,000 of souls, without attracting to itself envy and dislike. Our neighbours have been for a hundred yea endeavouring to convince themselves that we have no great quality, moral or intellectuaL Perhaps they retain that opinion now, but one thing they have been obliged to acknowledge,-that we have been successfuL England has been the successful nation, and mankind will forgive anything but sucs. So for the demonstration of the last few weeks we have not been unprepared. But it is instructive to watch the progrems of continental opinion since the revolt became general. We cannot compliment our eritics on their discernment or the skill with which they read passing events. They seem to have taken much the same measure of our power as the Sepoya themselves, and to have thought that directly the army revolted the empire was lost; so the only question was who should succeed to the fair inheritance. Should Russia annex it to her domain or France claim it in right of prior possession in the last century? Others, less pitiless, thought that Europe might restore it to the British CRowN under certain conditions which should effectually restrain our selfish ambition. In return for Gibraltar, Malta, and Corfu the great Powers might be prevailed upon to send an army to the rescue. But as time wears on, and it is found that the idanders, though outnumbered and surrounded by thouands of enemies, still hold their ground, that the tide of rebellion is being rolled back, and that a few months will restore the British Government to all, and more than all, its former power, the tone is changed, and there is nothing to be heard but jeremiads on the woes of the unhappy Eindoo, or edifying homilies on the wickedness of refrauiing from a national inculcation of Christianity. There charges we may indeed leave to balance each other. The very neglect of eonversion, which is blamed by the new-born zeal of the continental press, the very acquiescenco in idolatrous practices, sprang from a mistaken feeling of respect for native rights, which is quite inconsixtent with the charge of tyranny and oppression. The English Government, indeed, has only erred by adopting too completely the liberal policy of the Roman conquerors, who guaranteed the religion and even joined in the rites of the races they had subdued. It was, indeed, this over-delicate respect for the superstitions of Musulman and Brahmin which encouraged tho outbreak, and the fault, if fault there were, was ore which it was natural for a fe and high-minded people to commit. However, it must be plain to every reasonable man that humanity and Christianity are mere pretexts in this case. The French journals which have assailed us know well that our Government baa been in an eminent degree enlightened and humane; that India owes to us all that it is and all that it will be; and as to neglect of a religious propaganda, the objeetlon comes strangely from the countrymen of the Generals who professed themselves Mahomnedans in Egypt-from the nation which still forbids any attempt at conversion in Algiers. No; the Remee des Deuv Mondes has arrived at the right solution. Eavy is the true feeling which has prompted all these demonstrations of satisfaction-all these diatribes on our inhumanity and irreligion; and in a few weeks the same feeling will produce ill-concealed irritation at the re-establishment of our authority. The Revue des Deu= Mondes is oonducted by men who are generally honest and courageous enough to speak the truth, and it has had experience of French andcontinental opinion during the last threemonth&. It speaks truly of the reproval of the Sepoy atrocities by the press of its own country as "an official duty," " a debt to humanity and the comnmonest pro" priety," and goes on to say that, this duty once performed, popular opinion does not disguise its content. " Let the English nation," it continues, "be well assured that it is not loved in the world; "it is too selfish for its misfortunes to be looked "upon by other nations as family misfortunes, "and it has been too fortunate not to have "provoked immense envy." This is, indeed, the truth from a French point of view. Whether England be selfish or not, there can be no doubt that to her fortune and present prosperity she owes all the invectives which have bean hurled against her. For this we are prepared, and, as the writer truly says, " the English have the 5instinctive consiousness of the sentiments "they inspire, and they confide in them"selves alone." Our neighbours, there fore, need not endeavour to deceive either themselves or us. We well understand what such phrases as " GOD forbidwe should rejoice in these " calamities! " mean when they are followed by half a column about our oppression and perfidy. We care as little for the censures of these journals as we need their pity. The " humiliationt and the " sad spectacle" which they affect to mourn over, while they declare it a judgment on the nation, are now passing away, and will leave the fabric of British power stronger and more imposing than ever. The mutiny of 1857 will then be remembered as the event whiich gave a new impulse to the career of conquest and civilization which began a hundred years before.
Lord ELL NBonouGE iS just the man to give the militsxy authorities advice at the present crisis. Warlike tastes, a patriotic spirit, and a fervid temr perament impel him to take a heroic view of things. The vicarious bravery of this coiintry can hardly be expected to satisfy one whose standard is so high. ThQ pa7iug of taxea and the hiring oR trook aro not the whole of a great nation's duties at a time of peril. Enthusiasm and sympathy are insufficient when they end in words, or at most in a pecuniary subscription. We must fight for ourselves if we would uphold the honour of the country and the safety of the empire. Such is the gist of the noble Lord's letter to the Winchcomb Agricultural Society. The means of actively aiding the national cause recommended to the gentlemen and farmers of the distriet is the encouragement of the Militia. Gentlemen can do much; farmers, perhaps, more; and whenever these two clasmes act with vigour and goodwill there wiU be sure to be a regiment, with a full complement of men, a good spirit, and a sufficient discipline. How necesaary it is that this domestic force should be available at all times needs not to be enlarged upon. It feeds the regular Army, by inducing men to enlist for a short period, and then giving them military tastes, which lead them to adopt arms as a profession. It garrisons our seaport towns, our Mediterranean fortresses, and, should war threaten us at home, it would stand boldly between London and the southern coast. Therefore, not only for the present emergency, but as a permanent institution, the country should foster and develope its MlUila system. Thus only can we repress such outbreaks as the Indian Mutiny, and bid defiance to the "great military Powers of " Europe, always prepared for war, offended by " our pride, resentful of our former victories, and " coveting our present wealth." In all this we fully concur; nor do we less applaud another section of the community. Lord E1rxrNnoxouoni appeals to gentlemen and farmers; I but the inhabitants of our great towns are equally anxious to do their duty in their own way. While the country districts are organizing their Militia, the plan of Volunteer Regiments is being discused in more than one quarter of the metropolis and the principal seats of commerce; it is to direct these endeavours into what we conceive to be a right channel that we would say a few words. Such a crisis as that through which the nation is now passing might be well expected to produce its full amount of unselfish feeling and patriotic efforta. The country has been roused by what is certainly the most terrible eveat of our own time, and would be ready, were it necessary, to make the largest sacrifices for the support of its power and the preservation of its fame. Happily, the march of events has been so rapid that already the danger may be considered as past. The storm which burst on our unprepared Government and scattered forces has spent its fury, and by every succeeding mail we shall probably hear of the discouragement, the desertions, and the defeats of the unhappy men who rose up in arms against us. There is, therefore, not that urgent necessity for the use of extraordinary efforts which existed Ieven a short month ago. No doubt, activity in the Government and zeal in its subordinates wll be required for some time longer; and to make any pause in the despatch of troops at the present moment would be only a repetition of that unready policy which has brought upon us so many calamities. But still the nation is, as far as human eye can discern, relieved from the fear of immediate peril, and we may examine calmly and thoroughly the measures which should be taken on the recurTence of any sirilar disaster. The discussion regarding the formation of Volunteer Regiments has borne this fruit, that in more than one quarter there in a desire among young men to organize such corps for service in India and in other parts of the world, should it be necemsary. Such schemes ehow how much of energy and high feeling there is in the country; for, though the united idngdom supplies the only large volunteer army in the world, we here find that there is the spirit to aid this regular force by a still further levy composed of men attracted to the service by the sole desire of helping the country in time of need. But, as things are now brightening in India, we can afford to temper this enthusiasm with a little reflection. Fully maintaining the arguments we have used on this subject, and feeling, as before, that to the native energy and courage of the people we must owe our position as a nation, we would still like to inquire further into this question of volunteering. Within the last three years we have had two grest lessons in the art of war. As a sensible nation we have not lost the benefits of this bitter experience. It is the general demand of all classes that the country shall 'oe for the future better prepared for war at home and abroad. The feeling which came into existenee some ten years since respecting the insecurity of the country and the inadequacy of its armed force has deepened and become stronger since late events. Not a little, indeed, has been done. The Militia has beer re-established, the Army has been increased and improved, the Staff, the Commissariat, the medical service have all benefited by the trials of 1854. There is abroad a universal feeling in favour of endowing the country with a sufficient force, offensive and defensive, to maintain its position. Tne Crimea and India are but episodes; the permanent security of the Empire is what the Legislature and the nation must aim at. Now, take the case of a Volunteer Regiment raised for active service In India, or Caffraria, or the coast of China. It will consist of men generaly above the station of common soldiers, who will require an allowance above that of the regular army, not to speak of more comforts, better clothing, and more liberal treatment, than are to be found in the Line. A Regiment of Volunteers serving in India would therefore be a privileged corps, differing from those surrounding it, and inducing comparisons more or less invidious with the regular Army. As the arms, accoutrements, clothing, and other necessaries would be found by the nation, it is needless to say that the expense would be much greater than in the case of a Line regiment, and it is doubtful whether the service rendered would be equivalent to this increased expenditure; for it must be remembered that it is enthusiasm that would chiefly urge young men into the service, and that enthusiasm is naturally a short-lived passion. At such a conjuncture as the present, when our countrymen are slaughtered andcour countrywomen dishonoured, there are many who would gladly go half round the world to avenge them; but such calamities are fortunately rare. Even in the present case we see that by t;e time the warlike fervour has been kindled, and brave determinations are about to have t'leir result in action, the occasion is passing away and' the usual state of things retuning. In almost any crisis, them, we may predict that the formation, drilling, and despatching of Volunteer Regin-_-its would be too sbw a process for the needs of the State. These are, we think, sufficient reasons for not tneting to a-Atve volunteer service in distant parts. The force would be expensive, it would be less highly disciplined, it would tend to melt away as soon as the excitement of actual conflict was past, and it would, in most cases, only arriva at the seene of action when its services 'were no longer needed. Yet we have the firmest cowsiction that to some su h levies this country mus resort if it would maintaia its present posit5on without burdening itself with an increased Army. The Militia is, no doubt, a most important force, but it is supplied by the 8ame ciass as the Army, and is often rather a rival than a feeder to the regulv. recruiting. It does ng' attr those who would be disposed to volunteer if they could serve with men of education and mranners. There certainly seems room both for Mfilitia and volunteers, and the question is how to utilize the latter force and make it a real national defence. This, we think, may be accomplished by making Volunteer Regimnnts a permanent, and not a mere temporary or spasmodic institution,-by raising them, not for service abroad, but for supplying the place of troops sent abroad. Let us dismiss the Indian revolt from our minds and consider the country to be in its normal state,-an island placed in the neighbourhood of great military monarcbies, and ruling men of every race in every part of the globe. It is evident that for active service in these distant regions we require regalar troops enlisted for a term of yean, whom we may use as garrisons in time of peace as well as lead agaisut the enemy when quiet is disturbed. The great object of the nation should be to be able to send the whole of this regular Army to any poiut that might be menaced. The part of volunteers should be to give security to the country during the absence of the regular force. England has the advantage of being able to dispense with any armed force for the purpoce of keeping order at home. Even Ireland, lately so turbulent, might now almost be left to itself without any fear of disturbance. So that, with a good Militia and a strong volunteer force, we might at all times be ready to ship off the Army to any part of the Empire. By no arrangement that we can conceive could the active service be much aided by volunteers. How can we expect the mass of our young men who are in business and professions, or the artisan clas who work for their daily bread, to leave their employmenti and go to the other end of the world to put down a mutiny or repel a Ca&ie invasion? But if volunteering were made a local affair, if men joined the regiment of their respective towns for service at home in time of need, we might expect that a large proportion of the energetic youth of the country would enrol themselves in such bodies. A simple uniform, a rifle, and two hours' drill every fortnight would soon make a respectable corps, for educated men would hardly require that long course of drilling which is necessary to turn ploughboys into steady infantry. It might before long beconae a point of honour in a young man to be in a Volunteer Regiment, and the country would gain the services of thousands of brave men at little or no expense. We gay nothing of the spirit and military knowledge which this would tend to diffuse in the community, now perhaps too much inclined to trust its defence to the paid professionals of war. Without overdoing the thing at first, a commencement might still be made, and the enthusiasm of the moment directed to the permanent strengthening of the Empire.
Railway accidents, it is said, have been lately on the decline; at least, if we remember rightly, the grand general balance officially struck at certain periods between the number of pasengers conveyed and the number injured by default of their own presented a diminution of calamities on the occasion of the last report. Nevertheles, within the Last week or two a series of casualties has occurred, or been threatened, which may well tend to revive the anxdeties and arouse the vigilance of the public. The examples have been attended with remarkable fatality, no fewer than 10 lives having been lost -eight of passengers and two of the company's servants, while all have been distinguished by some singularity of character. On the Great Northern Railway it seems most probable that the origin of the a;cident must be sought in the speed of the tin at the moment, but this opinion was strongly controverted by official evidence. On the South. Western the boiler of a locomotive exploded with such terrific violence as to blow the unfortunate stoker to a distance of 50 yards on the line, and to hurl the driver lifeless through the air on to the top of the refreshment-room. On the South Wales Railway tvo pasenger trains came into direct collision with each other on the same line of rails, and three lives have been lost by the resalt. Of this dister we need say little, as it w as a natural consequence of running a down-train upon an up-line; but the bursting of the boiler was described as an almost unprecedented and perfectly Inexplicable catastrophe, while, unless the hypothesis above referred to be accepted in the case of the Great Northern accident, that also must be numnbered among the mYsteries of the period. To this catalogue of horrors we must needs add the recent conflagrations of carriages in motion, for, though no fatal consequences actually ensued, they were certainly not escaped through any safeguards provided in the regular course of things, and the calality threatened was frightful in the extreme. Fortunately, notwithstanding the alarming character of these events, there appears no necessity for concludling that railway travelling is exposed to any novel or additional dangers. We have already expressed, and we now reiterate our own opinon, that the rapidity of the motion wa the ultimate source of evil on the Great Northern line, and though we cannot, in the face of daily evidence to the contrary, assert that peed is accompanied by any great degree of peril, we think the particular accident in question would probably not have occurred if the rate had been somewhat slower. With regard to the South Wales disaster, nothing, we presume, can be much easier than to provido that down-trains shall not run Upon UP-lines; while, as to the dangers of combustion, it is perfectly plain that insurance against fire can be established in the case of a rail'way train with the least possible difficulty. It is beyond all question that when fire is discovered in a carriage the train could be stopped in time to prevent mischief, if the passengers could cormmunicate with the conductor. It is also beyond denial than an apparatus for this purpose could be adopted Without either trouble or cost worth mentioning. The sole objection to the plan is grounded on the asmption that if people could stop, the train for one tbing they would stop it for others; that all kinds of hindrances would ensue; that time under such conditions could never be kept; and thiat the Public would suffer accordingly. We are not prepared to deny that a passenger may have other, and, indeed, justifiable mo.ives, for stepping a train, independently of the prospect of being burnt. The other day a man was attacked by a fellow-passenger in a carriage and half 3nurdered. Sometimes, too, a breakage or slip of some sort occurs, which passengers discover before the gnard does, and there would bs, no harm in tutilizing their vigilance as well as his. We believe that in nine cases out of ten where a train was stopped it would prove that the stoppage was desirable, and the punctuality of traveling is certainly not observed so fastidiously at this moment as to warrant such excemsive jealousy in protecting it. Traitts are delayed perpetually for the sake of the company's own arrangements, to put down Directors, or Directors' frieci,is, to pick up trucks or carriages, or to let other trains get out of the way. To find time kept to the minute is a thing by no mean universal, and we do not see why the cusstomers of railway& should not have their share of 1ndalgeuce as wel as the railways themselves. At all everkA the system may as weU be tried. Lord BROUGHAMA, as our readers will hav( observed, brought the whole rmubSect conaprehensivel1 before the public at the iiu6b= Meetig and seemed desirous of resolving tho dater of railway travelling in general into the single peril of excessive speed. With many of his Lordship's arguments-preliminary as well as imnmediate-we are quite disposed to concur, and certainly, on foreign railways, where the speed averages some 25 miles an hour, accidents are of less frequent occurrence than in this country. But the rate of speed is not the only point on which English railways differ from those on the continent. Our companies-necessarily perhaps-run very many more trains within the 24 hours, so that the dangers of collision are proportionately increased. They conduct also on some lines an exceedingly heavy goods trafflic, and, as a consequenoe of all this pressure, the servants employed are hardworked and their faculties severely tried. In fact, railway business in England is but an additional expression of English businems habits altogether. Our shops, our streets, our warehouses, and our thoroughfares are aU characterized by more activity and bustle than ever prevails in foreign towvns, and railways do but keep pace with other establishments. The only place where there is stll more scramble is America, and there they have also more railway accidents. Nevertheles, there msnt be a foundation of truth in Lord BRouGOAmss hypothesis. We certainly cannot change our ways all at once and become Germans or Belgians in the matter of travelling, though we might be all the safer for the amendment. Neither do we think that people would be ready to accept " a ma=imum of 25 or 30 miles " an hour," with a " prohibition of exceeding this " in order to make up for lost time," for we suspect this would bring us in the end to something very like the old rate of coach journeys-indeed, his Lordship's recommendations as to easy-going trains were by no means grateful to the truly British audience around bim. It may be urged, too, on this head, that if any traveller sets his heart upon a slow train he is pretty certain, on most lines, to find one or two of them in the course of the day. Yet, after all, it does plainly stand to reason that the danger ordinarily incident to railway travelling must receive a certami aggravation from a practice which increases the wear and tear of material, the oscillation of the train, the difficulty of stopping when stopping becomes abruptly neceuary, and the force of the shock when impact or collision occurs. There might be some medium between 25 miles an hour and :'0; and, above all, there might and should be such a reform in general arrangements as would obviate the necesity of extraordinary speed at certain points of the journey, in order to keep the whole rate -up to the average. In most cases it is not this avera,e which is exceasive; but when time has been lost at this point or thai it becomes necessary to make up for the sacrifice by special precipitation, and here occurs the period of danger. The quickness of an express train is secured not merely by its average speed per hour, which is often not much above the speed of ordinary trains, but by the rarity of stoppages and the absence of delays. If these conditions were looked after with more alacrity in all instances we might still have very rapid travelling, and yet very little hurry and many fewer railway accidents.
THB PACIFIC. By the arrival of the West India stemer Magdalena at Southampton we have rewelved corepondence and files of papers from Pansma to the23d ult. Dates from Valpariso are to the 1st of September, but there is nothing of general interest to communicate. The annlverary of the Independence, which is colebrated from the 18th to the 20th, engaged more attention than either polities or busines, and in honour of that event Santiago, the capital, will then commence the regular illnminatioa of the stroete with gas The new theatre, a eplendid building. that has cost 80,000., wIil also be opened for the first time.

The Europa, Captain Shannon, has arrived with advices from Boston to the 7th, aud New York, by telegraph vid Halifax, to the 8th inat. She has brought $2,500 in specie. The Arabia, the City of Washington, the Argo 'the New York, the Fulton, the Angl-Saxon, and the Niagara had arrived out. It is stated that no Collins steamer would leave New York on the 10th, but if the Atlantic arrived -out by the 11th she would return to Liverpool on -the 13th. The steamship Star of the West had arrived at Nevr York with the California mail of the 5th ult., and $1,268,734 on freight. It was anticipated that Mr. Weller would be elected Governor. The town of Columbia had been destroyed by fire; several lives were lost. Mlining continued to be carried on vigorously and successfully. New diggings had been discovered. The citizens of San Francisco had 'voted by a large majority to pay the State debt. Three more persons belonging to the Central America steamer had turned up, after being adrift for several days on portions of the wreck without food or water; they were rescued by a vessel; their sufferinga were horrible. It was commonly reported at New York that a steamer, though watched by the authorities, had sailed with munitions of war, intended for a new expedition for Nicaragua. Commodore Paulding, in his report on the Inter-oceanic Canal between Aspinwall and Panama, says the Isthmus seems to present no obstacle to the construction of a canal, but that there would be great difficulty In procuring labour for the successful accomplishment of the work. Fifteen persons had lost their lives by a steam'boat collision on the Mississippi. Seven large warehouses had been destroyed by fire at Louisville. A despatch from Washington says the export duties on tobacco at Vera Cruz had been repealed. A despatch from St. Louis says:- "Nearly 1,000 Missourians have enter6d EZansas, between 'Qulndaro and Weston, to settle there; but well-informed persons in Misouri say that it Is for political purposes; 0vldence of concerted action along the wvhole border is be-coning apparant, but violence is not apprehonded." A despatch from Augusta (Georgia) states that Brown, Democrat, had been elected Governor by a large majority. Advices from St. Domingo state that the capital, In which President Paez resided, was surrounded by the insurgents of Ciba.. This condition of things had lasted for over a fortnight. The revolution in Yucatan had not been suppressed. Advices from Havannah report that business was dull. Freights inactive. The yellow fever was declining. Exchange oni London, Ili to 12. Some 20 or 30 persons had been arrested, and were still confined In gaol, awaiting the action of the Real Audiencia for importing slaves. All the bozales that could be found in the city, no matter to whom they belonged, were forcibly taken from their owners. The Pre7nsa gives a flattering acrount of the prospects of the crops. The NVew Yor- Courier and Enquirer of the 6th Bays:- "The heavy payments of Saturday last having been mainly overcome, there is some slight relief felt to-day, but it must be considered very slight. The Bank statement for the pat week will not meet the approval of the conunnity. It was announced lmt week that after consultation amona the representatives of the banks, an increse of 5 per cent. on their loans had been Fgreed upon, but this promnld Increase has not taken place.

Among a few the change Is very slight, but, on the whole, thera Is a general decline equiralent to nearly 2 per cent., instead of at advance of 3 to .5 per cent, in the loans. The exchanges, both foreign and domestic, are now in favour of this city.

The Newo York Times says:- " e understand that the Bank of British North America, through its agency in this city, has ordered gold from London on the prwsent low exchange to the ramount of 100,0001. stenlns," At a meeting of the merchants held at Boston on 4he 2d resolutions to support the banks and expressive of good faith in them were passed. The senti'meats of the meeting were 3 to 1 against any bank n-upensior. The same feeling was quite imanimous ,with all the banks of the State. The New York Triblne says "Tho range of good bills is from par to 10.3, although -some prominent drawers are asking more without maing ,ales." The Boston Advertiser of the 7th says,- "The weekly bank statement which we publish this morning shows a docrease In the loans and discounts of S*449,000. The paymonts at the Sub-treasury yesterday amounted to more than $1,250,000." The Pennsylvania Legislature was convened on the 0th, and a messago from thbt Governor was read, An which he recommended- "That the banks which may be relioved from the penal -ies upon suspension by existing laws be required to make a satisfactory arrangement with the StateTreasurer, by which lie wil be enabled to convert the funds in the Tresury and the balances standing to his oredit in any solvent bank Into *speie as soon as necessary for the payment of the funded -obt; andthat solvent banks which have paid speoia for alt their liabilities immediately prior to the late general suspension be requlied, umder limitations and restrictions, t eceive the notes of each other continng solvent at par-in pYament to be relieved from their condition; and for the elef of debtors that a proison be made for the extenion of the time on which execution for judgment may iue; the bswe of relief notes of small denomination should not be authorized, nor the banks during their suspenstorn be permitted to declare dividends exoeeding 6 per oent, per annum." The Governor believes that the moneyed instltutions of the State are in a sound and solvent condition, and that if the measures suggested are adopted all will be made right; several bils bearing on the subject were in course of discussion. At New York holders of cotton were offering to sell at a decline of a half cent per lb.; but there was no business doing. Flour declined, owing to the monetary pressure, 50c. to 70c. per barrel upon shipping qualities. It afterwards recovered about 25c. Spirits of turpentine lower. Little doing in sugar. Prices of molasses in favour of the buyer. By telegraph to Boston we have further advices from New York to the evening of the 6th,which are as follows:- " There is not much change to note in the aspect of money matters. The Bank statement had a very depresing Inflaence on Etocks at the firt board. Messrs. Yelverton and Walker suspended yesterday. The Weare Bank, New Hampshire, was thrown out yesterday. The Bank of Lima is again received. Bills of the Lee Bank (Mashusmetts), Mercantile, Charter, Oak, and Exchange Barnks (HArtford county), and Bask of Watertown (New York), are thrown out to-day. Stocks have farther declined this morning and are quite dull. Willetts and Co., of Pearl-street, hardware and oil-house, are reported failed. The draughts of lAtner and Co. had been protested, Money continues In demand, and not so freely offered. We ean give no acon. rate rates. The day closed upon a very tight money-market. The difficulties of negotiating exchange have induoed merchants to order grain to he sent forward, guauteeing the expenses here. Sterling bills closed 99 to 100, and to eover actual transactions some names sell a little higher, hut only In small sums. The receipts at the Sub-Treaury were $228,868, and payments $1,288,000 odd; balance, $6,560,000 odd. The American Exchange Bank, after honouring the draughts of Messrs. Sather and Churoh up to the close of businesa yesterday, refused to pay them this morning, and they were protested.

SOUTHAMPTON, OcT. 18. The United States' mail steamer Ariel, Captain G. D. Ludlow, arrived off Cowes this morning, en routte frora New York to Havre and Bremen. She left at noon on the 3d, and has had a very stormy pasage. She brings 15 passengers, but no specie. A pamsenger named Felix Carrene died on board on the 13th ant, of chronic diarrhosa. Financial affairs continued in a very gloomy state, and things appeared to be getting worse, rather than !better. Another pniic seized upon holders of stock securities In New York on the 1st, which increased in intensity on the following day. The money article of the Herald, dated 6 p.m. on the 2d, says:- ,, O all the gloomy days we have seen within the past six months this has been by nil odds the worst. AlU the panios previously experienced are as nothing compared with that of to-day. The decline in stock since yesterday haa been 6reater than yet realized in the mme length of time sinoe the present revulsion oommenced. At the firt board today there wa a most frightful stampedo among holders of stocks, and the beat on the l1st were slaghtered right and left. If there ls a much lower depth for some stocks they will go completely out of sight. Thelosses realized must be immense, and the community at large must be suffering immensely from the enormous depreciation in market value. At the first board to-day Mis,ourl Sixes declined 2 per cent. - Erie bonds, 1871, 3; New York Central Sevenths, 1; iderchants3 Bank, 1; Park BaDk, 5; American Exchange Banak, J; Ctomberland Coal, t; Delaware and Eudaun, 4; Pennsylvania Coal, 4 ; New York Central Railroad, 5- Erie, 1i; Newhaven and Hartford, 2; Reading, 2; bichigan CentralRailroad, 7- Mihi. gan Southern, 1; Illinois Central Railroad, 4A; Cleveland And Pittsburg, 1; Galena and ChIcbgo, 6; Cfeveland and 'roledo, 2 i Chicago and Rook Island, 7; Milwankie and &ississippc, 1. Hiere we have a fall ranging from one-half to 7 per cent. At the close yesterday no one anticipated .uch a serious and sudden decline, and no one knows but that a similar tovement may be realizd to-rnorrow. The selers are those who from actual necessity are compelled to realize at any prioe. The sacrifices are not mrade so much by those who are afraid of fnrther depeciation as by those who want money and are disposed to s- 11 anything they possess to meet their current payments. 8his shows what material our community ismade of, and It is suoh material that has made this city the metropolis of tbe Union. It is fearful to think of the consequences of such self-sacrifices, and it is terrible to contemplate the rnsult of such a determination on the part of business men. After all, itisbetterto do this than tosuccumbtothefirst reverse-than to sit quietly and patiently down and see the wreck going on about us without making the first effort to resist the revulsion. By those who can see their way out, if there are any such, such sacrifices are cheerfully made; but those who are so deeply involved as to be only getting dec"er and deeper into difficulties do wrong to exhaus4 their remaining substance without the probabillty of ultimate success. " The failure of the housejof Pierre Chonteau, !on., and Co., fur dealers, &c., was announced this morning. This Is a branch of the St. Louis house. There are several other bonees, and it is supposed they have all gone down together. This is one of the oldeat houses in the country, and until very lately was supposed to be very strong. The fetatre of the present revulsion is that some of our oldest and larest mercantle ooncerns have been the first to suspend. We are requested to say that Mr. Chouteau's iron house in the city, known and conducted under the firm of P. Chouteau, jun., Sanford, and Co., at No. 9, Nassau-street, will not subpend, but meet prompily all its engagements. The business and assets of thih latter firm have always boen kept entirely distinct from those of Mr. Chouteau's other houses. "At the second board the market was, on the whole, lower. American Exchange Bank declined 1. per oent. ; Re3ding, Ij; Cleveland and Toledo, 1 - La Crosse and Milwaukie. J. New York Central openexd at 55, but feU immediately back to 52. per cent., and closed heavy at that There was not much business this afternoon, there being no buyers, both from the want of means and the disposition. As a general thing, all of our railroadstocks are unprodulctive. It is pretty certain that on the part of these corporations there will be a general suspenrion of dividends, and it w he year-s before the best of them recover, and many will never resume. We have long anticipated such a result, and it is about being realized. This class of securities wi be unproductive for years. Bank stocks are settling down sbout as fast as any other on the lis, and the sales are daily increasing. " The position of our banks is a matter for calm and serious consideration. This month and next is the time for our heaviest payments, and we must look for such times in the financial world as bave never before been seen or imagined. The banks have a dangerous and difficult part to perform during the next 60 days, and if they play it properly the future will be full of hope. The resolution purporting to have been passed by the managers of these institutions amounts to just nothing at a'll. It was only partially agreed to, and not sufficiently officit' to be binding. It was intended more forfancy than fact,and itis ourimpressionthat the next returns will show that it has not been carried out. The banks of this city cannot expandand preserve their position as specie-paying institutions. Their only safety is in contraction. The banks of New England must suspend. We do not see how they can avoid it; but the banks of this city can sustain themselves if they will adhere to the policy they have for some weeks pursued. Nothingelse can save them. The banks must now show to the community that they have in reality no soul, and they must not flinch an instant from the awful responsibility resting upon them. An expansion would lead to an Immediate drain upou our specie reserve, and stop at once the current of specie now setting into their vaults. An expansion would temporarily relieve the community, but it would end in suspension of specie payments by the banks. Better hundreds upon hundreds of our merchants should fail than our banks suspend. It is a distressing alternative, but we see no help for it. With our banks firm and fixed as specie-paying institutions, the country may recover from this revulsion in a few months; whereas a suspension of specie payments would prostrate every important Interest, from which we should not recover in years. It is hard, and may seem cruel, that the commercial comrmunity should be sacrificed to proEerve our banking insrtitutions, but it is necessary to acX so as to guarantee the greatest good to the gre.atest nu-mber. Our banks must not look now to imd vidual oaaes, but to the commnunity at large. A few meat, be sacriced - immolated, if necessary, to preserve tlk, n .asses. We are awore that in advocating these measures weimeet the con. demwioua4 ol wany, but wo do aot k,e,ed thj, i; pursuing the general obect in view. The nanagers of our banks seem to be at lt fully awake to the dangers and difficulties of their position a*rd we wish to aore them of the support and oountenance of the public in a steady adherence to the course they have marked out for the immediate future. We ares wmling to abide by the result."'

Iuch embarrasext is feit abont exchanges, and in payments due to New York and Boston. The rate on ew York is 6 per cent., but where it enters into the contract for interest it is often higher. The C(%L(a'nati Guzettc of the 30th ult. ob. serves :- "The feeling in the mercantile community was stronger tovday than previously in favour of a general uspension. The demand for Eastern exchange continues presing, but no considerable amounts are to be lad at any price. The rangs to-day for the few draughts sold was from 3 to 6 prem. Gold is also very scarce, and those who hold it are not disposed to sell The brokers are not disposed to encourage the retail demand, though this is supplied to some extent at 5 to 10 per cent. There is no change in the character of our par currency, which consists of Ohio Indiana (State Bank), Kentucky, and Louisiana paper. Al other paper is at a discount, the rates varying from 5 to 15 per cent, for solvent banks, including those that have suspended specie payment. Trust Co. ehecks were offered to-day at 25c." The Philadelphia, Ledger of the 2d inst. says * Two or three quite large failures here were announced esterday, one in groceries and one in the West India and grth Amercan trade, and one in dry goods. The aniouncement of the several facts created some little excitement, but the community has become so used to such occurrences within the last few weeks that they have ceased to command attention longer than for a very few hours. The facts will probably be to continue the stringency of the money-market, and perhaps add to the stock of pretested paper held by the ban;s. At present there is ttle doing in hillsion the street. There is money enough in thee hads iof capitalists but borrowvers, having lost credit, ent distress and embarrassment until we have a re.intp ion of specie payments, he that period near or re- On the subject of financial prospects the Philadeiphia Penssylvanrian of the st inst. has the following remarks : "There is no new feature in the aspectof monetary affeirs, and business is almost completely at a stand in oonsequence of the necessity of business men accommodating emselves te the altered circumstances. The progress of the suspension is watched with extreme anxiety, and with here and there an exception it is likely to become general, and it is feared of at least a year's continuance. The bauks of New York, among other hopeful indications, have wisely, and as they can well afford to do, resolved not only to continue the payment of specie, but to extend the line of their accommodations to the extent of about three millions, which, while it will tend to assure their ovn PoRition, will materially relieve business, not only by the direct aid It affords, bet by the assunnce It gives of a cessation of the contraction. Here, also, the banks are disposed to some extent to increase their discounts, but as a whole there is far more trepidation among them than In the community, and that full aid which they should give to business cannot therefore be expected. The suspension has caueed much less alarm and disturbance at the West than might have been supposed. So far it embraces only Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and New Jersey, and Connecdtut in part. It is not presumed that the B9oston banks wil srspend, and Louisville and Cincinnati have thus far withstood the shock unharmed. The banuk generally of the States of Ohio and Kentucky wll not, it Is 1resumed, suspend-certainly not for a time. At New Orc(ns and st. Louis, where legislation provides for an enlarged specie basis, their banks will not come into the measure of suspension. New Orleans has 6,000,000 in specie against a circulation of 8,000,000. St. Louis has 3,000,000 in coin to meet a limited circulation ; but Illinois, Indiana, andWisconsin are more inflated-their Issues being based upon State bonds now depreciated 15 to 30 per cet, instead of gold and silver. We notice that the Pittsburg Bank is still paying specie on all its liablitles, refusing to come nto the arrangements for a suspenson. The officers of all the other banks of that city, Irecting a suspension, expressed the opinion that it was necessary to protect the business men in enabling the banks to continue to discount local rper and exchange, and peremptorily instructed the cashiers of the respective banks to resume payment of specie when similar action has been adopted by the Eastern banks."

There was no evidence to show that the deceased had been subject to any foul play. the wounds on the head were of a superficia character, and had not caused death, and might have been inflicted by a barge passing over the body, or in getting It out of the water.

He was picked up at a part of the canal easily accessible to the publc, and death appeared to have resulted from drowning. No money waa found in his pocket.

On the outward voyage of the Mibgdalena, lr. O'Donoghue, of Berbice, died of consumption on the 12th of September; and, on the homeward voyage, Mr. Eisenblat, of La Guayra, died on the 12th inst., also of consumption. The Magdalena experienced fine weather during the passage home. Sha exchanged signals on the 13th inst., in lat. 45 21 N., long. 22 29 W., with the English brig Marian, steering-to the eastward. The steamer La Plata, with the outward mails of the 17th ult., arrived at St. Thomas's on the 30th. In lat. 24 31 N., long. 52 34 W., she passed a sunken vessel, apparently a brig. Stations of the company's steamships :-The Clyde, at St. Thomas's, for the Spanish Main; the Conway, from the Windward Islands, for Jamaica; the Dee, on the Spanish Main; the Derwent, at Barbadoes, for the Leeward Islands; the Eagle, at Jamaica, for British Honduras; the Thames, from the Spanish Main, refitting at St. Thomas's ; the Trent, from Jamaica, for the Windward Islands. HTer Miajesty's ship Brunswick was at Colon; the Tartar at Greytown; and the Imaum at Jamaica. Our advices from Jamaica extend to the 27th ult. The news is altogether devoid of interest. Commercial matters were extremely dull, and the rainy season had set in in good earnest,-it rained nearly a whole week without intermission. At intervals there were vivid f'ashes of lightning, accompanied by terrific peals of thunder. The ensuing crops present a very cheerful appearance and exhibit every indication of yielding abundantly. The island was comparatively healthy. The brig Mary was lost In the Anegada Passage, on her way from Porto Rico to Kingston, but we are happy to state that all on board were saved. De Cordova's Mercantile Intelligencer reports the receipt of pimento in very large quantities, and the existence of fears that prices would not be sustained on account of the crop promising so well; for immediate wants 3d. was being paid. Sale, of coffee were quoted at 42s. to 44s. per 1001b. Middling sugar was in demand, and sales had been effected at 28&. to 31s., according to quality; a lot very dark sold at 25s. Corn was abundaut, and American being little looked for, dull of sale; home gro;ti sold at 4s. per bushel, and American at 10s. per bag. Flour continued dull, seUing at 38s. to 40s., according to quality. Cheese was wanted, there being none good at market, and eonsequently no sales to report. There w-s no butter at market, either American or Ini, except about 300 firkins just received from Liverpool by the Protector; all previous receipts weio cleared at 13d. for American, 13id. for Halfax, and 15d. for Irish. No wholesile transactions in beef reported; small sales had been made at 66s. per halfbarrel. Best brands of brandy were quoted at 22s. to 24s., and rum at auction realized 4s. 5id. and atprlvate sales 4s. 3d. for18proof; the tenI dency .was downwrard. Codfish was in large supply, which, together writh the depressing effect of the rainy weather, kept down prices, and rendered It difficult to snake sales. In pork sales were reported at 128s., at which figure one lot had been taken. Freights were scarce. Exchanges on London (Jamaica and Colonial Banks), 90 days, 1 per cent. pm.; 60 days, 1A~ per cent. pm. ; 30 days, 2 per cent. pm.; mercEaits' bills, 90 days, par to 3per cent. pm.;g Commissarint iBills, I. per cent pm. On New York, 60 days, 1Gs per cent. pm. -merchants' bills. From Demerara we hear that the accounts of the gold diggings at the Yuruari continued to excite a great deal of interest in the colony. The Court of Policy had held one sitting since the last mail, and were occupied wrrith matters relating to steam navigation and the exploration of the interior of the colony. The weather latterly had boeen very wet, and thunderstormns frequent and of long duration. Planters were anxiously looking forward to a change of weather to bring the canes to maturity. Trade was dull. Freights were arce, and tonnage abundant. At Barbadoes his Excellency the Governor opened the legislative session on the 16th ult., and Mr. Thomas, the senior member for St. Georgs, was elected Speaker for the 11th time. The rainy season had set in with full vigour, but the planters were most sanguine of having their average crop. MIr. Walker had left Barbadoes to resume the administration of the Government at St. Vincent's, his Excellency MIr. Eyre having obtained a further leave of absence for four months. There is nothing of interest from Granada. Little or no change had occurred in the weather, which continued favourable for the planters, and crops of all descriptions promised well. The harbours were destitute of shipping, and the markets all well stocked. The sanitary condition of the island was satisfactory. Of the eight sick men of lHer Majesty's ship Brilliant landed here two weeks ago, most of them in a dying state, two had survived and were doing well, under the skilful treatment of Dr. Aquart. The Brilliant sailed for Nova Scotia on the 13th ult., after an interchange of complimentary lotters between the rgallant officer commanding her and his Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor of the colony The latest accounts from Trinidad state that rain had prevailed for the last fortnight, and the oldest inhabitants can scarcely remember the rivers coming down so furiously. Accidents were frequent, and attended with losg of life. The reports of the crops were not so favourable as from the other islands. From British Honduras our latest arrivals inform Us that cholera was raging to a fearful extent in the interior. Through the active measures taken by the authorities its progress had been arrested in the city of Guatemala. It originated with the troops coming from Nicaragua to the former city, which place, however, they were not allowed to enter, but were placed in quarantine some miles ofF. ne trade from Guatemala to. the port of Ysabel was completely suspended, owing to the panic caused by the ravages of this fearful visi-tant. The Hon. William E. Tenable, lUnited States Minister to Guatermala, fell a victim to the disease on the 22d of August, only about three weeks after his avaL. Senora Dona Petrona Garcia de Carrera (lady of the President of the Rerublic) Dr. Don Quirino Flores, and two other physicians, Kad a?so died. At St3?homas's the yellow fever had entirely subSI sided. Pulmona.ry affections were very rrevalent,. but not of a serious character. On the 28th and 29tb of September the town was thrown into a state of great excitement on the occasiop of reopening tihe Roman Catholic chapel, which Inad been elosed for a year and-a-half. The Gove,nor seperintended in person, but even his presence had not the desired effect on the mob, a large party of whom evidently entertained the -rost bitter feelings against the priest who offlciated. The riot at length beoame so Violent as to render the presence of the miitay neoessary. Several P",rsons were arrested, gad ordor was restored by the evening of the 29th,

The troops were loudli. cbeered on their march from the railway station at Land. port to the dockyard. The Brazilian corvette Imperial Marlnheiro, 15 guns; Captain Torres Alvin, arrived at Spithead on SaturdY forenoon, and salutedtlah-ff-ag of Rear-Admiral Baynes, the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacfic station, 'with 13 gung. This was a mistake, as the flag of Admirxl Sir George Seymour, the Commander-n-Chief, was flying on bo&td thb Blenheim, in Portsmoutth harbour; but, as the salute could. not be unfired, the Blenheim ack-nowledged- it with the samenumber of guns. The Brazilian afterwards salutedthe national flag, and General Scarlett, the Commandant of the garrison, returned the coopliment from the ling'sRavelinCaptain Alvin was subsequently presented by Chevalier Pappilardo, the Brazillan Consul, to the nral militry-, and civil authorities. The object of the corvette amchoringi at Portsmouth is to give her officers aii opportunity of inpecting the Dockyard and other Government eetalisixments. From Portsmouth she wi proceed to Cherbourg and other French ports with a similar object. The Cyclops, 6, paddlewbeel figate, Captain PUen, will eave Portsmouth in a few days for the Red Sea to asist in laying down the electric cable. The Ganges, 84, Captain Fulfor d, ag of Rear-Admirad Baynes, C.B., sailed from Spithead on Saturday afternoon for the Pacific station, calling off Plymouth for the latest instructions and mails for the squadron. The strength of the garrison at Chatham has been con. siderably augmented by the arrival from Ireland of the depot companies of the 18th (Royal Ish), 51at (the King's Own Light Infantry), and the 94th Regiments, numbering together nearly 400 men. The 18th and 31St have been attached to the 3d battalion, and the 94th the 1st battalon. Notwlth. standing the large number of troops that have left Chatham for India the garrison still oonsists of nearly 3,000 men of all ranks, of whom upwards of 1,000 are well disdplined troops, capable of taking the field immediately. The first detachment of a West India regiment that has completed a course of instruction in the Enfild rifle at the School of Musketry, Bythe, arrived at Chatham on Saturday afternoon, the draught being composed of non-commnis_ sloned officers and men of the 2d West India Regiment, iz charge of Ensign L. A'A. de Lancey, of that corps. A number of the privates are rmen of colour. On their return to the West Indies they will be employed in Instructing the men of their corps in the use of the Enfield rifle. The following officers have joined their Indian depots at Cbatham previous to their embarcation -Ensign I WiU. Hams and Ensign H. S. Jones, 84th Regiment. It is expected that a considerable body of men from eah of the dep6ts in the camp at Colchester wi shortly leave for India. The recruits do not come in so freely as they did a few weeks since The Rev. B. L. Walsh has been ap pointed assistant chaplain In the camp. Lieutenant Robert H. Burton, first of Her Majesty's steam sloop Malacca, took up his commission on Saturday, and hoisted his pennant on board Her Majesty's ship Spit. fire, at Woolwich, as LIeutenant In command, The Spit. fire and Triton are fitting out, it is said, for the coatA of Africa. The paddlewheel steamvessel Banshee, tender to the Fisgard, Master Commander H. W. Allen, silued from Woolwich yesterday morning for Otend, to embArk- the Prince of Wales and suite for Dover. The various segments of the, huge mortar at Woolwich, cast from a design of Lord Palmeraton, and the entire weight of which exceeds 50 tons, have been placod in posi. tion. The mortar now stands on Its platform ready to undergo the anxiously anticipated proof. Its elevation is about 42 degrees. It is feared that the day appointed for the experiment will not be made public. Commander W. H. Haawell (1850), Commander S. Morrish (1851), Commander l Marshall (1852), Commander A. J. Curtis (1852), and Commander H. Boys (1853) were on Saturday promoted to be captains. At the same time, Lieutenant G. Durbin (1846), Lieutenant Horatio Nelson (1846), and l1eutenant A. G. Fitzroy were promoted to be Commanders. In consequence of the above promotions Sir Charles Wood made on Saturday the following appointments:- Commander J. B. Ballard to the Imaum, vice Morrish, promoted; Commander R. G. Craigie to the Himalaya, vice Haswell, promoted; and CommanderL. E. H. Somerset tW the Devastation, ta-cc Marshall, promoted.

- P FOBBIGN IYTXLLIGNOZ?. FRANOE. (A portion of the tollowig appeg II our second edition of Saturday :-] (FROM OUR OWN UoSponT.) PAMI, OcT. 16, 6 PmL There appears to be at last a probability of a Government being formed to replace that of Narvaez. A telegraphic deapatch of the 14th from Rome announces the departure from that city of Senor Mon, who proceeds to Madrid to take office. General Armero also enters the Governvtent. Other names have been mentioned as likely to be Included in the Combination, but they rest on mere conjecture. It would not be surprising if Pidal, the brother-in-law andcountrymanof Mon, andwhoisnotoriously greedy of power, were to contrive to fird a corner in the new Cabinet. It is greatly doubted whether Mon and Armero will be able to form a very durable Ministry. They will certainly meet a formidable oppoition in the present Cortes. Bravo Murillo would have had a firmer seat, but it is now said that the Queen never zeriously intended availing herself of his services, and had him at the Palace merely to talk with him and sound him. If Bravo Murillo believes this he may prove a dangerous foe to the new men. It is pretty evident that Queen Christina has had something to say as to the selection of Mon, and that the telegraphic despatch she received from her daughter on the ]lth inst. had reference to this. It was doubtless, to inform her that Mon was telegraphed for. It is rather premature to speculate on a situation still so vaguely defined, but the suJmmons of Senor Mon to power must, I think, be looked upon as an indication of Royal adherence to the Constitution-of course, to that of 1845. Queen Christina, it Is woll known, has never been favourable to her daughter's Absolutist projects, and it is probable that her influence is for the moment In the ascendant. Queen Isabella has contrived to allenate the goodwill of so many of the principal men in Spain that it in not surprising if, in the present prolonged crisis, she has felt herself at a loss for a counsellor on whom she could depend, and has reverted to one of proved sagacity, and who has not at this moment any imaginable motive for advising her daughter to a course inconsistent with her real Interests and safety. Christina is well convinced that when the present Queen of Spain ceases to be " constitutional" she will place her crown in the most Imminent peril. Of this, at various times, and especially within the lastfew months, when rumours of a projected COUp d'dtat were frequently rife, she has earnestly warned her; and, although the warning was unwelcome, it appears at last to have had The Dsbats, whose articles on Spanish affairs are usually more remarkable for ingenuity and imagination than for an impartial appreciation of the men and politics of Spain, seems rather puzzled what to say now that Narvaez, whose Government it lately supported with ardour and many eulogluius as the model of virtuous and efficient administration, has positively fallen from power. To-day it attributes great projects to the Queen, projects the possible realization of which (even if we admit that Her MIajesty really entertains them) must, unfortunately, be looked upon aa very remote. That journal says:- "' The Queen hopes to succeed in composing a Ministry which may be able to come to arn understanding with the najority of the two Chambers, to give a powerful impulse to business, to constitute a strong and regular Administration, to re-establish by the authority of the law the traditions of right and justice, put herself in good relations with the great European Powers, reconstruct the general policy of Spain, obtain her admission into the great councils in which the destinies of States are decided, and replace her In the rank which belongs to her, and which she would never have lost without her deplorable dissensions." Very sanguine indeed must be the journal or the man who believes in the present possibility of a Spanish Government which shall fulfil all these brilliant anticipations. The plan of re-uniting the various fractions of the monarchical constitutional party into one harmonious whole, also announced by the Ddbats, has been often entertained, but never realized; and, before believing thatj it can be, we must have grounds for thinking that public men in Spain have, by some process that woulid be almost magical, been converted from selfish plwchtunters and vindictive partisans into the patriots they habitually represent themselves to be. Wow that the camp of Chilons is broken up, and the troops are on the march back to their garrisons, the weather, the inclemency of which accelerated the termination of the manceuvres, has again become the very best that could possibly be desired for them. After a few days wet and wind, summer has returned to us. All this week we have had cloudless skies and a delightful temperature. The change comes too late. No more, for this year, shall the banks of the Cheneu witness the martial array of stately Grenadiers and agile Zouaves, or the plainrs of Champagne tremble to the tramp of charging squadrons. The peaceable campaign is at an end. The principal personage of the military display-the only one, it may be pretty confidently asserted, for whom the duration of the camp did not appear wrearisomely long-has exchanged the tented field for the statesman's cabinet, has doffed the insignia of commander-in-chief, and wiiU soon be winding the huntsman's horn in the pleasant glades of Compiegne. With the exception of the 4th Voltigeurs, which had the luck to be despatched to Paris by rail, the troops are tnidging their way to their winter quarters; the Zouaves havinig been sent roand by Troyes, a great circuit, the object of which Is not understood, unless it be to show them to the natives. Although the camp is not yet quite cleared out, we already learn that the hares are visiting their old haunts, and even making their way into the deserted tents. In another day or two the tract, lately so lively,wlll be left to its winter guardlans, and the two adjacent villages, Mourmelon the Greater and the Less, will have relapsed nearly into their former tranquillity, with the pleasant consolation of counting the considerable sums their rapacious inhabitants have extracted from the canmp and its visitors. To-day the Cuwhstwi?tionsmdel inidulges in a lengthy farewell laudation of the new establishment, praises the troops, the maae(iuvres, andthe administration,andextols, above all, the institution of a permanent carmp as the best nursery of the militarv spirit of the army, too apt, it says, to get weakened by Its dissemination in the numerous garrisons of France. A paper is in course of preparation in the bureaux of the Legion of Honour respecting the medals and crosses permitted to be worn in France. This document, when completed, will be officially published, with instructions as to the mnanner in which those honorary dlistinctions are to be worn, some of the wearers at present permitting themselves strange caprices in that respect. It is reported, but needs confirmation, that, in consequence of a recent convention, the Russian naval force in the Chinese waters, which has been lately increased, wiiU in future combine its operations with those of the English and French squadrons. An intention is said to exist of re-establishing the corps of pupils of the Guard created under the first Empire. A private letter from Pondicherry, dated September 4, says- " In ordinay times the first 10 days of the lunar month of the Mohurrum are, as regards the Wussuin, a period of over-excitenaent, and frequently of distrbance. Fears were entertained this rear that the fanaticism of the Ma. homedan portion of She population would impel them to greater excesseI in consequence of the rmilitary mutiny. These fears, however, were erroneous, for the population of Pondicherryexhibited an exoezent spiit.Althokh theoarases is an essentially Mussulman festival, Indians unconnected with that religion join in it in great numbers, and durling the first eight days both sects are seen traversing the town, fancifully attired, their bodies covered with flour, rlnging balls, beating drums, and springing rattles-in fact, enidea. vonring to make as much noise as possiblo, in commemora. tion of the death of the Imam Hussein, son of A, aand grandson of the Prophet Mahomet. The Imam was kllled in the plain of Kerbelah by Chemar, the General of Yezid, Prince of Damascus, and his competitor for the Khalifat. On the eighth day of this mourning the agony of the Imam is represented in illuninated chapels erected in the streets. The true believers curse his asassin and celebrate his merits with the most hyperbolical praises. On the 10th day the festival concludes with a procession known under the name of the Gounds. The population attends in crowds, and each corporation Carries on litters ornainental structures, brilliantly illuminated 'with revolving lighte, which produce a very picturesque effect. These Gounds are afterwards carried two miles outside the town, where their immersion in a lake puts an end to the ceremony. This festival passed over in pondicherry with the greatest order, although zwith three days of incessant noise." Letters from the frontiers of Asia announce that General Jacob, who commands the Engrlish troops which were charged with watching Herat, had evacuated Affghanistan, and had arrived at Moultan, in the Punjab, on the 17th August. A letter from Calcutta of the Sd September informs us that Sir Colin Campbell had left that city on the preceding day for Allahabad, where he proposed to establish his head-quarters. M. Alexamdre Basset, chief editor of the Pays, has received the medal of St. Helena, to which he was entitled as Ifeutenant of infantry durina the first Empire. At the close of the year 1813 M. Basset had passed his examination for admission to the School of St. Cyr, where he was accepted, when Massena, then Governor-General of the southern departments, being a friend of his family, appointed him to the staff of a moveable corps in the Var, which lasted until the last days of the Empire, in May, 1814. The following private telegram has been received:- "MARSEILLES, Ocr. 15. "Accounts have been received from Constantinople to the 7th. "Trade was in a very dull state. "Seventy-six thousand medals of the Medjidie will be sent for distribution to the English army and navy. "Prince do Joinville had returned from his excursion to the Crimea, amd had left for Smyrna." The Constitutionnwl offers the following reflections on the revenue returns for Vie first nine months of the present year:- " These returns show, as comrpared with 1856, an inorease of 27,000,000f., and the augmentation wouldprobably have been 29,500,000. had not 1S66 been leap-year, and conse. quently had the advantage of an extra day's receipts. - Itts also Important to observe that the fallng off in the quantit'y of home-made and French colonial sugar, and the consequent increase of price, diminished the consump. tion of an article whioh is so advantageousto the revenue, and led to a decrease of 8,00,000f. ln the receipts. It will perhaps be objected that If the revenue suffered a loss on home-made and colonial sugar; it obtained an almost equal increase on the import of foreign sugar; but it Is well known that these sugars are for the most part re-exported in a re. fined state, so that what remained for home consumption did not offer an equivalent compensation in point of revenne. The financial results of the nine months must therefore on the whole be considered -satisfactory. It must not, however, he denied that the retrns show some traces of recent embarrassments and failing off In business. While the first two quarters gave an excess of 26,285,000f., the lst three months only showed an increase of 580,000f.; during the latter period, therefore, there was an evident slackening In commercial affairs. What must, however, be pointed out as favourable is that in the last quarter the second part was much better than the first. The month of July, for in. stance, showed a diminution of 2,402,000f., and ye. that failing off was covered and exceeded by 580,000f. by the receipts of August and September. With regard to the different Items of revenue we may add that with the excoption of the home-made and colonial sugar, which show a considerable falling off, the others, such as the duty on foreln sugar, the registration dutles, the tax on potable liquors, and the sale of tobacco, all show a progressive improvement." The Dg&ts comments on the same subject In these terms-- "Except in one single year-1854-the increase of the revenue has been constant and regular; for a period of ten years it has augmented very nearly 58 per cent. On reflection it will be seen that in that there Is not any great subject for astonishment, for the progress of the public revenues Is, a!;er all, a normal thing; it is the natural corollary of the development of the population, and with it of consump. tion rnd business; but it must be admitted that the annual increase of revenue Is, to a certain extent, diminished by the gradual and at present rapid depreciation of the precious metals-a depreciation which, while respoting the nominal value of the monetary s, leads, as is known, to a general dearness of all objects of consumption. However this may be, the amelioration is incontestible, and is of a nature to oreate confidence, if it were needed, as to the resources which our country can find In itself against the financial perturbations which almost periodically, like the tides, affect more or less seriously the material prosperity of nations." The receipts of the Paris and Orleans Railway Company for the week ending the 7th inst. amount to 1,286,158f. i5c., being a decrease of 35,404f. 68c., as compared with the corresponding week of last year. The receipts from the 1st of January to the 7th of October amount to 44,510,546f. 7c., being an' increase of 5,S46,807f. 55c., as compared with the corresponding period of the year 1856.

The Msnncipal Council of Paris met yesterday to consider what name shall be given to the new boulevard which has been lately opened from the Chateau d'Eau to the Barriere du Trdne. The Council finally decided that lt shall be called the Boulevard Prince Eigsne, after the Emperor's uncle, and that a statue of that Prince on foot shall be erected in the centre of a nes square, through which the boulevard wfill pass. Several German journals have spoken of the approaching meeting of a Congress in Paris to regulate some great European questions. The fact is not so. A conference is to be helid of delega tea deputed by the Congress which met in Paris,'but the object of the conference is solely to terminate the question of the Principalities as soon as the special Comnmissioners shall have forwarded their report. The Commissioners, however, cannot forward their report until they are apprised of the resolutions adopted by the Divans ad hoc. A case interesting to travellers in France has just been decided by the Coirt of Cassation, the highest legal tribunal. According to a Royal ordinance, published in 1563, a hotelkeeper is bound under penalty of a fine to lodge travellers who stop at his house. An hotelkeeper in a country town who refused to lodge a traveller was prosecuted before the Court of Police and acquitted; the traveller appealed, and the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal, founding their decision on a law passed the 13th of March, 1791, which declares thaf commerce is free. Aletter from Belgrade of the 10th inst. states that Raja Damjanoviteh, senator, and former Minister of the Interior, who was returning from a sitting of the Senate in the same carriage as the President of the Assembly, was suddenly arrested in the street by the prefect of poliee and two gendarmnes. A police officer proceeded at the same time with 15 cua1ry soldiers to Semondria to arrest the senator Paun lankowitch, former Minister of Finance, who was there on leave of absence. It t said the parties arrested are accused of having eonspired to assassinate the Chief of the State. The two senators arrested formerly possessed great influence and were highly popular.

(FROM oU0 OWN coP S1o`xONDr.T) BERLIN, OCT. 15. To-day, being the King's birthday, has been observed as a holyday at all public offiees; and at all places of public entertainment the Prussian colours, white and black, wave conspicuously. The brass band which every year, on this anniversary as well as on other high days, greets the early morning with sacred melody from the gallery round the base of the whole of the Palace, performed, as usual, Psalm tunes in honour of the day; but the 101 guns that are usually fired on this oceasion were today omitted, out of respect to the suffering state of His Majesty, who enters to-day his 63d year. In all churches of the metropolis Divine service has been celebrated with special reference to the anniversary, and with a mingled expression of grief, hope, and joy. The bulletins of last night and this morning continue to be favourable; the former runs thus- "His Majests state of health Is this evening as favour. able as it was this morning. 6" Sans Soucl, Oct. 14, 7 o'clock p.m." That of this morning early was His Majesty has passed the night In tranquil and refreshing sleep. " Sane Soue, Oct. 15, 81 o'clock a.m." As the King's body physiciams have pronounced the malady to have assumed a milder form and a normal course, the bulletlns are In future to ba issued only once a-day, and for the present, at any rate, all apprehension of danger seems to be rem.oved. The question of how the transaction of public business is to be arranged seems, however, to be not as yet settled. The various organs of the press, as may well be expected, do not fail to-day to favour their readers with some effusions in connexion with the anniversary of the King's birthday, and the melancholy circumstances under which it is this year celebrated. The article which stands at the head of to-day's Zeit, the Ministerial paper, contains somewhat too much fustian In the first half for English taste, but the second half contains a not exaggerated statement of the King's career- " If anything can avail to inspire our august Sovereign with courage and strength to look forward to the unknown future, It is that tranquillity of conscience with whoih he can look back on the past. He has [passed a life long already in duration, and replete In strpggles, in which through God's help, he has gained the victory; replete in trials, through which he has passod with undiminihed adherence to justfce; but, above all, replete with aset of benevolence, the blessings of which his coun. try already feels, and will contlnue to feel for ages yeto oome,-for the seed of justice, virtue, and god.y fear produces thousandfold fruit when sown by royal hands, and Frederick Willaim IV. is an indefatigable labourer in the vineyard of the Lord. He knows that he Is armed with the sword of God, for the punishment of thoe wicked and for the protection of his land from danger; but he prefers to wield the sceptre of bounty and goodness, and he has thus by love and trustfulness gained back to our fatherland thousands of hearts that had gone astray. For this reason we recognize in our Sovereign a real klng by the grace of God; for this reason we know our eountry is weU advised as long as It is intrusted to his conduct by the providential hand of God; and for this reason we never flag or grow faint in praying, God preserve and bless our King !" The Natiowl Zeitug, which affects oppositioa and democratic tendencies, cannot to-day refuse to bring Its tribute to the Monarch whose Government it at other times would gladly show to be as far from perfection as human efforts generally are, and even further, perhaps. It gives usthe following short notice as a leading article this morning:- " The serious circumstances under which His Majesty enters a new year to-day confer on the congratulationi, which year by year are, in this country, offered to.day, a peculiar significance, and insplre them with the mora sineerity. By but a little has His Majesty exceeded his 60th year, and finds himself In that period of life in which every head of a family becomes the maore valuable to those around him, when the mature powers of manhood begin to be associated with the reverence due to advanced age, and when with the feelings that the sight of him inspirwe u with a dash of softer emotion is ndlgled. At this perio I of life a man may sti11 do much that is good, a perio I in which nature often mingles that due proportion o' strength and gentleness, of firmness and laisser fairz, which necessarily constitutes a'perfect man; and deeply Indeed is a man to be pitied to whom, after toiling througx the burning hours of life's earlier day, this period of cool, calm, and satisfactory retrospectiva contemplation i; abridged. May that fortunate detiny that has for manr years presided over His Majestys lot confer on him this la t blessing of our earthly existence, and by the restoration o health infuse into him strength to live and to work for many years to come." The University, the Academy of Arts an I Sciences, all public schools and charities, have celebrated to-day's anniversary In different ways appropriate to their respective natures. Divine service was celebrated in the morning at the Garnison Kirche for the Protestant troops, and in the afternoon for those belonging to the Catholic Church. The Ministers and all the Diplomatic Body attended divine service at the Dom, at the conclusioa of which the members of the Diplomatic Body proceeded to the Foreign-office to present to Baro a von Manteuffel their best wishes for His Majesty's steady recovery. AUSTRIA. (FROM OUR OWN CORRPOKNDN.) VIENNA, Ocr. 14, Yesterday an opportunity presented itself of exchanging a few words with a person who is likely to have some knowledge of what passed at Stuttgart between the Emperors and their M,inisters for Foreign Affairs. The Emperor Napoleon ani Count Walewski talked more of nationalities thaa was to the taste of the Czar, " and cortain remarks respecting Poland and Italy were unpalatable both to him and to his official adviser." The Emperor of Russia entertains a very kindly feeling towards the King of Naples, and he seemed vexed to find himself brought into such close contact with Priace Murat, " whose partisans are known to be plottincl aggainst his Neapolitan Majesty." In conclusion it was said that if the Emperor Napoleon had produced a more favourable impression on the Czar, the latter would perhaps have displayei less cordiality towards the Emperor Francis Joseph. Since the Imperial Court has been at Ischl it has had several foreign vLsitors, and among the rest the Count and Countess Trapani, who were desirous ts become personally acquainted with the Duchess Maria of Bavaria, who is about to be betrothed to the Duke of Calabria, the Crown Prince of Naples. The Queen of Naples procured the portrait of the Duchess Maria, a younger sister of the Empress of Austria, and the King was so pleased with it that he resolved at once to demand the hand of the original for his son and heir. According to a persoa who knows the Duke of Calabria intimately, h) is a good-natured, timid young man, who has hitherto been well content to let his father and his confe3sor think for him. The Ost Deuttscle Post of this morning has a semi-official article which contains some further particulars relative to the trip of the French, Rassian,and PrussianCommissaries to the " Iron Gate3," and of the French and Russian war steamers Meurtriere and Ordinarez to Turnu-Magurella and Giurgevo. The three members of the European Danubiali Comnission who arrved at Orsova on the 29th of September were Baron Offenbach, M. De Engelhard, and Cotucillor Ritter. The first gentleman represents the Russian, the second the French, and the third the Prussian Government. After stating that the commissaries and their companton, the well-known Prussian engineer Nobilina, endeavoured to obtain from the servants of the Danubian Company the valuable unedited charts and drawings of the rapids at Jutz, Greben, Tachfahia, Islatz, Kasla, and Stenka, the Ost Deutsche Po.t proceeds to say that the gentlemen must have under- taken the expedition for their own private amusament, as their of ficial occupation is ex..ctly defined and limited in paragraph 1(i of the Treaty of Peace, which says that delegates of the seven Powers " are to be charged to direct and execute the operations necessary for clearing the embouchures of the Danube from Isachta downwards." " The appearance of foreign ships of war," says the Austrian writer, " At Turnu-Msagnrella and GIlurgevo Is an event which deserves theogreatest attention. 1. The Danube is to be froo,ar,d, asIsoxpresaly stipulatd Ihoteaty of Maxrch 30, ' according to the principles established by the Act of the Congress of Vieuna for the regulation of the navigation of rivers wvhich separate or traverse several States.' Thus the Dankube, like the Rhine or the Elbe, sa tobefre oral ner1&u vsslscoin fomth s' It was fotnd necessary to neutralize the Black Sea, but each Power was permitted to have a few smaU vessel with which to assist In maintaining order In it. Now, order Is maintained in the Danube by the rimrain Powers, and foreign men-of-war have no right to enter it unless they have special permission to do so from the Sovereign or Suzerain of one of the riverain States This principle is olear and indisputable, and the presence of the two vessels of war, howrever peaceful their object might be, was a violation of it." Strange and contradictory rumours are in eircula. tion respecting a plot which has just been discovered in Servia. It is not positively known whether the conspiracy intended to attack the person of Prince Alexander or to overthrow his Government, but the story last night related tome was that an "attempt"' (cdfnten.t) was to have been made on the Hospodar. lTo senators and several persons of less distinction have been arrested. Some further intelligenoe has been received from Cattaro relative to the expedition of the Pasha of Scutari (Albania) to the district of 'Vasojevitz. Four thousand regular troops and as many Albanians marched from Scutari to Vasojevitz, with instructions to redluce its inhabitants to submision, to disarm them, and then to levy the taxes which they owed to the Porte. The Vasojevitrer applied to Prince Dan2el of Montenegro for assistance, but he long declined to interfere in a matter which did not directly concern him. As the Turkish commander was advancing, his regular troops (the Albanians) comitted such great excesses that Prince Daniel considered it advisable to send his brother Mirko, the President of the Senate, with 500 men to the frontiers. A collision would Drobably have ensued between the Montenegrins anci Turkish troops if an English commissary had not arrived on the 2d inst. at Cettinye, and informed Prince Daniel that the Porte had, at the request of the English, French, and Austrian Ministers, sent orders to the Pasha of Scutari to leave the Vasojevitzer in peace. Unfortunately the bearer of the despatch did not reach the Turkish corps until its vanguard had forced its way into the district of Vasojevitz and destroyed several villages. It is said that hostilities are still going on, but reliable news on the subject have not yet been received. On the 24th of September the chiefs of the inhabitants of the district of Kuci which was haried about two years since by a detaclment of Montenegrins under Mirko Petrovitch, rendered homage to Prince DanieL We learn from Berlin that the circular of Aall Pasha to the Turkish diplomatists abroad has produced " a good impression" on the Prussian Government, and it is probable that such is the case, for the semi-official organ of Baron von Manteuffel never spoke in favour of the political union of the two Principalities. It is very generally believed in diplomatic circles that Lord Clarendon's plan for an assimilation of the institutions of the two provinces -will eventually find favour with the Powers, and that two Hospodars will reign over them as heretofore. That Prince Vogorides is of opinion that such will be the case is pretty clearly shown by his subscribing 500 ducats to the fund for the sufferers in India. Prince Paul EsterhaW, who was so many years Austrian Minister in England, has just contributed 1001. to the same fund. On the 30th of September the Emperor gave permission to the Association of the Immaclate Conception of the Virgin to make collections through the whole empire for the relief and support of the Roman Catholics in the East. By degrees all the convents in Austria will be reformed, and if their inmates should object to the strict discipline which was observed by the founders of their respective orders, they will be secularized. In one of his pastoral letters to the Austrian clergy his Holiness expressed his expectation that the rich convents In Austria would contribute largely towards the maintenance of the Papal chair ; but the Austrian monks refused to part with their money, and thereby incurred the displeasure of the "follower of Christ." If Austrians cannot be induced to submit to the strict discipline which is to be introduced into the convents, Bavarian, BelgIan, Weatphallan, Italian, and Spanish monks will be imported, and they willl naturally have no right to object to the export of Austrian cash to Rome. Alas ! alas ! for Austria. A treaty of commerce Is likely to be concluded between Russda and Austria, and a draught made about a year and a-half since by M. de Tengoborsky, the Russian Counsellor of State, will serve as a basis for the negotiations. The French papers say that the city of Bologna has been evacuated by the Austrians, but the statement is incorrect. The Jews in Lemberg will in future be obliged to live in the " Ghetto," as the Jewrish quarter is commonly called on the continent. The chairs of theology in the new university of Innspruck are to be filled by followers of the order of Jesus (Jesuits). In future no Protestants are to be appointed chief physicians or professors in the General Hospital of Vienna. The critical state of the Austrian money-market, and the urgent necessity for immediate measures for its relief, will probably induce the Emperor to return from Ischl to Vienna sooner than was originaUy proposed. Last night M. Loucoup, the proprietor of a very large establishment in this city, attempted to blow out his brains. The unfortunate man did not kill himself on the spot, but he is not likely to recover. Credit Bank Shares have fallen to 198; Northern Railroad Shares to 107; and National Loan to 80. London is still at lOB. 11k. ITALY. (r0nox OUR OWX cosRESPoNzrmUT.) TURIN, Ocr. 13. By !a notification signed by Cavaliere de Winderkhern, Commandant of the Modenese Dragoons, and dated Carrara, Oct. 6, 1857, martial law has been once more proclaimed in the city and commune of Carrara, of the cause of which the MUesscvjgiere di Aodenta of the 9th inst. gives the following account. According to that journal, the Duke of Modena had raised the state of siege in the Carrara district last December because he thought that the punishment infficted on not a few disturbers of public order had been sufficient to repress the audacity of those wicked people who infest the city and commune of Carrara, but the confidence cherished by this most clement P-rince had been far from realized, for after a few months assaults, wMounds, and murders were not only recomimenced, but had been so frequently perpetrated as to give good cause for alarm to the peaceable inhabitants, and to induce the Government, however unWillingly, to provide anew, by exceptional measures, against this rising evil. Things had arrived at this state on the occasion of the departure of a great part of the garrison of Carrara for the autumnal manweuvres at Reggio, when some evil-disposed persons summoned courage enough to insult some soldiers in the theatre on the evening of the 27th of the last month, and at the same time to express their eontempt for the whole honourable class of which they formed a part. These provocations excited a confusion, in which a soldier and several civilians were slightly wounded, but the fact was not devoid of an appearance of premeditation, since one of those arrested threw away a dagger with which he was armed when taken prisoner by the police. The moderation of the troops in this instance was probably mitaken for weakness, for in the afternoon of the next day (the 28th) a fresh deed of extraordinary atrocity was committed. Three men belonging to the reserve of the army, -that is to say, Sergeant Ribolini and privates Zeni and Rocchi-were on the high road of Gragnana, near Carrara, and not far from their own houses, quiet and unarmed, when they were suddenly attacked with stones and daggers by seven young men known to belong to the city or neighbourhcod. The two first-named were killed outright, but Rocchi survived two days, and identified one of the assassins, who had been arrested by the police. Five others of the gang have since been captured by the Sardinian police, and their extradition demanded by the Modenese Government, in virtue of existing conventions, and the seventh, although well kniown, is still at large. This horrible crime, the 3Ifescggirrc di Mt'dena says, determined the Government no longer to delay giving effect to the extraordinary measures which it had alreadly thought of employing, and therefore it had, by a decree of the '30th ultimo, granted the powers by which Cavaliere de Winderkhern has now re-established the state of siege in Carrara, whereby it is hoped to remedy this exceptional state of things. The Duke and Duchess de Montpensier arrived at Genoa yesterday from MIilan. They were received at the rail'ay station by the Intendant-General and the military and naval Commandants. The Spanish steam-frigate Berenguela was in port awaiting their arrival. The Genoa papers of yesterday announce that the steamer Capitole, belonging to the French Company of the Messageries Imperiales, and which had left Genoa on the 9th, bound for Leghorn and .Malta, had broken down two hours after leamvig part, and was discovered in distress next day by the signalman of the Obeervatoxty at San Benigno, in consequenlce of which the Sardinian Governmnent steamer Gulnare was sent in search, but aid not find her until the following morning, the 11th, when she took her in tow and brought her into harbour at 4 p.m. The Capitole had 90 passenger3 on board, among whoir was Cardinal Villecourt, returning to Rome from a visit to his former diocess of Rochelle. On Friday morning last the United States corvette Constellation, in getting under way to leave the port of Genoa, ran foul of the Sardinian steam frigate Governolo, which was at anchor alongside her, and was likely to have done considerable damage to herself and others, but was eventually got off by the boats of the Sardinian navy and of the Spanish frigate Berenguela.
ASTLEY'. AMPHITHEATRE. Mr. James Robinson, an American phenomenon, is the present hero of the Astley's Circus. He rides on a " bare. backed steed," and while he goes through the series of wild feats that some seasons since distinguished his compatriot, Mr. Eaton Stone, at Drury-lane, he introduces some achievements of his own which competent authoritiee (including the Clown of the ring) declae to be without precedent. Leaps over broad " banners" and through hoops covered with tissue-paper are common enough, but the accormplishment of a somersault by the leaper on his passage, and his safe descent on the back of his horse, is a novelty in equestrian art, and this novelty is presented by Mr. James Robinson. The circumstance that the horse is bare-backed instead of being provided with a round, fiat saddle, that answers the purpose of a platform, of course increases the difficulty of the exploit, and consequently the merit of him who performs it. In maintaining a variety of equestrian and gymnastil entertainments, as a supplement to the warlike spectacles on the stage, Mr. W. Cooke is as active as ever. Two " Olymn pian brothers," each on a horse, go through a series of athletic displays scarcely less picturesque than surprising Miss Kate Cooke shows the training of her steed and her own horsemanship by a ladylike specimen of what is called the "haute ecole ;" a family named Ellis, who have devoted their energiesto the cultivation of glittering and tumbling, have brought to strange perfectiorn the kind of amusement provided some years since by the ever famous "Professor Risley." Then there is Mr. Cooke's docile stsed, who, without a rider, leaps over the backs of the three tame zebras; andthereis the " smallest horse in the world," across which the Clown sits with his feet on the ground, declaring that, " except for the name of It, he would like waUdng as well." In these days even the Clown's profession has faUen Into two departments-the English jester, who tumbles scarcely at all, but indulges in verbal pleasantries of no inconsiderable length; and the posture-maker of the French school, who is of a taciturn disposition, and relies on the surprise occasioned by the neatness of his somersaults and the strangeness of his contortions. The whole tendency of a modern equestrian cireus is towards boundless variety.
INDIA DIRECTORS AND INDIA MISSIONABIES. (From the Eraminer.) If we are rightly informed, two wise men of the East and great in Leadeshall-street have been propagating a theory of their own touching the causes which have produced the Indian rebellion. It amounts simply to this, that the pro. pa,ators of Christianity and missionaries, lay or clerical, have been at the bottom of the mischief. We believe this directorial hypothesis to be In flat opposition to facts, but as It comes from a semi-officlal source it Is worth some brief refutation. One of tho authorities In question wiUl have it that the rmutiny of the Mfadras troops which took placo at Vellore in the year of our Lord 1806, was in all respects a parallel case to that which is now raging from the capital of British India to " Delhi and Lahore of Great Mogul," and even further. Let us consider this point a lttle. The mutiny of Vellore was confined to the small fortress of that name. It was a conspiracy got up by the sons of Tipnoo, who were State prisoners within its walls; and the shaving of whiskers and obliteration of red ochro on the forehead, the alleged preparations for a forcible conversion to Christianity, sily military foppories as they were, were but pretexts like the greased cartridges of the present day. Or present great matiny has been already in existence, In one form or another, for eight months, and its utter extinction will probably take an entire year. The Vellore 6rescute was quelled in six hours time by the strong wlll and prompt action of one man-General Sir Robert Rollo Gillespie. He was 10 miles off when he heard the cannon of the traitors; he forthwith marched, scaled the walls of VeUore, and at once extinguished both mutiny and mutineers with grape and the English bayonet. The murder of European men, women, and children was the only thing common to the two mutinies; but even here there was a difference, for the mutineers of Vcllore did not mutilate, torture, or dishonoar their prisoners; they were content with simply murdering all the sick in hospital and every European of whatever age or sex they could lay their hands on. Let it not be forgotten that this suppressed anti-Christian conspiracy of VeUore took place but seven short years sfter the death of Tippoo Sahib-of that bigot who during his reign had forced thousands of Rindoos into Mahomedanisnt, and this, too, without producing any Hindoo revolt. But the most astonishing thing of all is to find our theorists treating all Indian history as they might an old almanack, and this for the purpose of propping up their own doctrine that the propagation of our religion, p art and parcel of our civDlization, should be discouraged. Oar Mahomedan predecessors in power, whose example in matters of law and finance East India Directors have been ever but too prone to quote and imitate when it suited their purpose, were from first to last, over a period of 700 years, propagandists alvays, and persecutors very often. The first of their leaders, the celebrated Mahomed of Ghizni, began by sacking the Hindoo temple of Sumnauth, and smash its idol with his own hand and batbletxe. He even carried off the sandal-wood gates of the temple which, at an interval of S00 years, a British Governor-General had the rare glory of bringing back for the gratification of Hindoos, the most trusted of whom w-ere destined in no long time to become traitors and assassins, The last Mahomedan prince of HEndustan that had the pwer to persecute was an eminent persecutor of Hindoos or religion s sake. This was Aurungzebe, the contemporary of Cromwell, of the Merry King, of William, and of Anne. As the greatest insult he could offer to the Hindoo religion, he pulled down their chief temple in Renares, and with the materials built a mosque wbich still stands along with near 400 other Mahomedan temples in this holiest of Hlndoo cities. AU this, continued for more than seven centuries, produced no mutiny of a Hindoo army, for the best of all possible reasons,-that the Mahomedans took good care there should be no Hindoo army of Brahmins and Rajpoots, lke ours, to mutiny. But this is not all; it was to the numerous conversions of Eindoos by foul or fair means that the Mahomedans owed the long endurance of their power, a power which, but for our own interference, would have lasted to the present hour. They are be,ieved to have converted about one twentieth part of the inhabitants of Hindostan, and these, amounting at present to some 10,000,0D0, united by at least the tie of a common religion, and generaUy of a common language, always formed the only solid ground of their power. Had theyljonfincd themselves, as,we have done, to ephemeral imI migrations of the victorious race, they could at best have only overrun the country; they never could have conquered it in the sense of holding a conquest. Bat the Ilahomedans not only persecuted the proper Hindoos, but all sects that sprang from them. It is to their persecutions of one of these, the Sikh, and the implacable hatred it generated through two centuries, that we are now chiefly indebted for these faithful aies. By the Dire^torial theory, the cause that consolidated the power of our predecessors is to be the ruin of ours. It has indeed, been very consistently acted upon by East India Directors for 100 years. They made the British Legislature believe that India was safe in no other hands but their own, or those of their own creatures. Hence all British subjects were by law liable to inamediate expulsion that were found in India without their especial leave and license, while it bas been only within the last 24 years that Englishmen could hold a rood of land in a country conquered with their own blood. Even down to the present day there are large portions of territory which have been 40 years in our possession, and from which Englishmen are by law stil excluded from settling or holding laud. Among the Englishmen forbidden to settle or even dwell In India were the original Protestant missionaries, who, to avoid the persecution of the East Inlis Company, wbre driven to seek shelter in a foreign settlement. General Havelock, of whose achievements the country is proud, is the son-in-law of one of the most distinguished of these original missionary fugitives. No Englshman, of course, desires to see, nor would Englrishmen permit or tolerate force in any shape or form applied to the conversion of Mahomedan, Hindoo, or Buddhist, for that would be, in addition to its criminality if possible a greater mistake in policy than the practical abnegation of our own religion. A perfect toleration of al forms of worship is the maxsim which this country will insist on in India as in every other dependency of the Crown, but this does not iniply that our own religion should be thrust out of sight, as if we were ashamed of it. Such conduct would amount to a premium on false religions, and, indeed, that premium we have been paying until it has produced us an army of traitors and assassins, Christianity is part of our civilization, and without it assuredly neither our arts nor our morality will make progress in India or any. where else. One word sn-e. One of our Leadenhall-street adversaries insis's on the wisdom of continuing the " traditional policy " which h a guided our conduct in the government of India fcr a hu,dred years. But the continuation of that policy in the spirit in which it has ever been acted on by the East India Company, in so far as they had the power to carry it out, would imply a great deal more than the people of England would now be likely to consent to; it would imply the exclusion from India of aU their countrymen that had not the Company's license; the exclusion from every vlace of honour or profit of every Englishinan except tho C3ompany's nominees; the management of the affairs of India after such a fahion as to create a debt at home, and abroad that a hundred milionswill not cover; the creation of a huge native army, so as to exclude as much as possible an army of the conquerors, and with it the legitimate power of the Crown; and, finally, tho pampering of uge native army so maintained, until it ended again in becoming a band of rebels, marauders, and murderers. Out, then, we say, -and the nation will say the samue thing, -out on the "traditional police" that has led to such results as these.
AUSTRALIA. The Liverpool and Australian Navigation Company's steam clip r Royal Charter, Taylor, commander, arrived at Liverpool on Saturday morning, from Melbourne, afer a rapid passage, with dates to the 14th of August, 118 passengers, and 84,000 ounces of gold and 24,000 sovereigns in specie on freight. She had also an extensive and valuable cargo, consisting of 279 bales of wool, 1,352 skilS, 04 hhds. of hides, 137 packages of talow, 2 bales of horsehair, 96 packages of British goods, 1 package of woodwvork, and 13,625 bags of copper ore. At Sydney the floods were subsiding. The amount of gold coin issued by the Sydney branch of the Royal Mint during the week previous to the 8th of August, had been 5 0001. in halfsoverelgns; the quantity of gold received for mintgage 8,456 ounces, of which 7,000 ounces were for Melbourne account. The escort from the Sydney goldfields had taken down a total of 3,438 ounces. Flour firm without alteration in price. Liquids a little easier, but holders not disposed to sell in any quantity except at full rates. Beer in bulk and bottled ale and porter commanded quotations. A pamel of Eagle and Lion negrohead tobacco from the United States had been nearly all disposed of at advanced prices. Speculative buyers were in the market, but the trade and dealers required al that was likely to arrive of marketable brands. Sugars, with small stocks and anticipated short supply in AManila, were expected to advance considerably for both raw and refined. In groceries little doing, buyers withholding purchases until the weather was sufficiently settled to admit of a better supply of carriage to the interior. 1'he quantity of wool sold for the week, 93 bales, was larger than that offered during the few previous weeks, and some of the lots excited much competitlon,I prices being decidedly firmer. Eighteen bales of superior scoured lamb had realized 2s. 6d. per lb; fleece, Is. 10d. to 2s.; handwashed, 2lid. to 22td. Few Bales of sheepskins, but pricea well maintained. 1,794 sold at from 81d. to 10d. per lb. TaUow in small supply; station realized 49s. to 50s. 6d.; beef, 47s. to 48s. Hides steady, and prices ranging from 15s. to 28s. We take the following from the Mellourne Herald, of the 12th of August *- "Oaz last summary of local events was prepared for despatch by the Columbian, which left with the colonial mils on the 23d ult.

The population is variously stated at between 50,000 and 60,000, and, as the reports of its rich. ness continue to. be most favourable, there is no immediate lielihood of any material decrease in the number. The auriferous deposits are said to extend over a very large area of country, and the mining Is not difficult. 'At present we are in nO position to give an estimate of the weekly yield of are m -mate the Art diggings,gavhe quantities of gold thence are inclt ied in the escort returns of Ballarat and others of the older mining localities. " The winter has been unusualy dry, and the miuers have accordingly laboured under great disadvantages in con. sequence of an insufficient quantity of water. Accounts from the various mining districts are, oi the whole, favourable. " AGasICULTrtAL. "In our last summaries we gave an abstract of the agricultural returns of 15 of the 21 districts into which the colony is divided. Since then two more counties have been finished, and the remaining four are so near completion that their contents may be given approximately. " In Mornirigton there were 156 cultivators, 3,433 acres, 2,057 sown with wheat, 827 with oats, and 420 with potatoes, Yield-39,988 bushels of wheat, 19,616 of oats, and 1,181 tons of potatoes. " III Dalhousie-688 cultivators, 12,590 acres, 4,276 of wheat, 2,303 of oats, 1,975 of potatoes, and 3,540 of hay. Yield- 82,494 bushels of wheat, 72,510 oats, 3,525 tons of potatoes, and 4,678 of hay. "In Hampden the returns are in, but there were about 25,000 bushels of wheat. " In Polwarth it is estimated that there are 60 caltivators, and that the produce is 30,000 bushels of wheat, and 20,000 of oats. In Grant it is computed that there were 1,200 cultivators, who had 40,000 acres under crop, of which 22,000 were sown with wheat, 6,500 with oats, and 7,CA60 for hay; the yield being 490,000 bushels of wheat, 172,780 bushels of oats, and 10,800 tons of hay. In, Bourke the following figures are, as nearly as possible, correct:-1,800 cultivators, 55,000 acres, 20,000 acres of wheat, 6,000 ditto of oats, 20,000 ditto of hay ; yield 400,000 bushels of vrheat, 120,000 ditto of oats, and 20,000 tons of hay. "' The grand total of the whole of the colony is therefore, in round numbers, as follows :-6,258 cultivators, farming 168,000 acres of land, of which 76,700 were sown with wheat, 21,000 with oats, and 45,750 with oats for hay, the resisainder of the ground being occupied with potatoes, barley, maize, gardens, vines, and tobacco; the yield was 1,700,000 bushels of wheat, or 22 bushels to the acre; 530,000 bushels of oats, or 25 to the acre; and 58,000 tons of hay, or about a ten and a quarter to the acre. This result is most gratifying; in 1855-56 there were only 1,151,000 acres in cultivation, and in the previous year only 54, ,71. In South Australia last year there were 203,423 acres under crop so that we nearly equal our great agricultural neighbours, and next year we shall have passed them, as from the vigour with which farming operations are now beinz pursued we may safely calculate that there wvill be 220,000 acres under crop next year. " Land still maintains a very hgh price. At a Government sale recently held at Crewick, near Ballarat, fair agricultural land, rather badly situated as regards a market, sold at from 31. to 41. per acre. Crown laud eight miles from Melbourne, of very inferior quality, sold two days ago at an average of 301. per acre. "TRADE ASD CO)1UNICE "The unsatisfactory character of the latest commercial advices from Bngland has had an extremely prejudicial effect on the operations of trade since the arrival of the mail steamer, inasmuch as renewed indications presented themselves that home shippers, uninfluenced by former experience and deaf to the remonstrances of colonial correspondents, were preparing to send forward excessive supplies of those descriptions of merchandise with which the market in this direction is already overstocked. As a natural consequence of this threatened glut of consivumnents capitalists are wholly disinclined to enter upon large transactions in imports, and prefer to invest thelr money in the various local joint-stock undertakings, which offer more tangible inducements than are to be found in the speculative business of buying, to hold for a rise. It would be impossible to lay too much stress on the vital importanice of iupressing the necessity upon merchants in the mother country of withholding further outward shipments to this colony until large portions of the stocks now on hand are absorbed. The business of regulating supplies by a reference to our requirements is unquestionably atask of considerable difliculty, and can only be effected by houses whose acquaintance with the fluctuating conditions which govern the Australian trade is at least sufflcient to protect them against the grave errors committed by 'outside' shippers. Fortunately for the mercantile interest of Victoria this latter race is well nigh extlnct, and has ylelded to a class of traders who will dou,bt. sess, in process of time, permit their proceedings to be governed by principles of cantion, and their ventures to be occasionally arrested by the dictates of prudence. Pending such a desirable consummation, however, there is necessarily an absence of that confidence which obtains in other and more settled markets.

IRELAjYD. (FROM OUR OWN COERRSONDENT..) DUBIJN, SATURDAY BiORNING. DR. CULLES AN,D TIliE RELIEF FUND. A Roman Catholic Peer (Lord Bellew), in reply to a circular invitation to attend a meeting in Dundalk for the purpose of raising funds for the sufferers by the mutiny in India, makes these temperate remarks:- " I think there is but one opinion on the subject, that as. sietance should be afforded to those forlorn and wretched sufferers, but such assistance should be prompt to make it effective. Folly concurring with those who call for a fair and impartial distribution of the funds that may be contributed, I cannot think it judicious ortpolitic to raise any question that may tend to stop the flow of charity which would naturally emanate from every human heart. If funds on a former occasion have been misapplied or perverted, let every caution be taken and exertion made to prevent a similar occurrence; hut let us,[ln the first instance, go forward cheerfully and heartily to the asistanc of our suffering fellow-countrymen of whatever class or creed they may be." T11E SEPOY JOrINALS. The WVZsteifonrd News, a Liberal journal, statei that the Natiun newspaper has been IIkicked out" of the C ommercial Newsroom of New Ross-the borough which formerly returned MIr.

Its late Sepoy essays led to its expulsion, which was moved by Dr. L3owlett, a respectable Roman Catholic gentleman. RtUMOflRED LEGAL uJTA\GES. the approach of Mlichaelmam Term brings with it the usual crop of rumoured changes in the Irish judicial bench. A London letter, published in the Mail of last niight, says:- uA mmour, which is understood to be well authenticated, is talked of here in legal circles, and has reference to some changes which it Is believed will take place at the Irish bar immediately after Michaelmas Term. According to the most popular notion, the Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer in Ireland wfill resign his judicial seat, and be succeeded by Mr. J. D. Fitzgerald, the present Irish AttorneyGeneral. Promotion is also spoken of as likely to fall to the lot of Mr. Deasy, Q. C., M.P. for Cork, who will, it is said, be raised to the Solicitor-Generalshio. These changes, you will understand, have not yet been foimally announced, but I have every reason to believe the parties interested have been communicated with, and there is no probability of there being any hitch in the business. Promotions in legal circles, whether they be in England or Ireland, are always very closely watched by the members of both 'bars.", GO VERNIMENET P'ATRONAG E. Lord Carlisle has just made an appointment which, miraculous to say, has elicited the warmest encomiums of the Conservative journals, notwithstanding the inauspicious fact that the gentleman favoured by the lrish Executive is a member of the Roman Catholic church. The Ecrini Mfail, in noticing the elevation of Mr. Mlichaei MIorris, of the Connaught bar, to the recordorship of Galway, says,- "A better appointment could not possibly be made. Mr. Morris is a gentleman of first-rate abilities, an able lawyer, a ripe and acomplished scholar; and, from the ansiduity with which he devotes himself to his profession, there cannot be the slightest doubt that, if spared, he will one day rise to the highest eminence. Mr. Morris is a Roman Catholic, but never lent himself to the base and worthless party who by adopting agitation as a trade have set a barrier between themselves and all good citizens. On the contrary, he always stood by his - order.' and, while paying all due deference to the clergy of his religion in spirstual matters, strongly and successfully struagled against their undue interference in political affairs. We wish Lord Carlisle would give us frequent opportunities of speaking in such terms as these of his appointments." TIlE LATE 5TE ROYAL IR1.iS DRAC(;OONS. The Lcinster E.prcss, alluding to the ruimoured resuscitation of the old 5thDragoons, who were disbanded at the close of the last century, has reason to believe that Colonel Dunne, late M.P. for Portarlington, is prepared to undertake the reorganization of the regiment. The Express thinks, and probably with reason, that the spirits of Ireland 60 years ago are not likely to obstruct the valour of a new Irish regiuent. At all events, it might be well to fill up a blank of very invidious import in the ArmqJ List, either by an English, Irish, or Scotch corps, or by a combination of the three elements, if more desirable.

THB SOUTH WALES RAILWA Y COLLISION. NEATH, SATURDAY. The inquest on the body of Sarah Ann Harmer, one of the sufferers by the late accident on this line near Pyle, was continued up to 7 o'clock last night, when an adjournment took place for the production of further evidence. Avfter the despatch of our parcel on Friday afternoon the most lmportant, and at the'same time the most unsatisfactory and conflicting, evidence was produced withreference to the cause of the collision and the orders given for the down mail to proceed on its jonrney from the Stormy junction of the Lynnvi VaUley Railway to Port Talbot on the up line of rails. I It will be seen from the following report of the evidence taken after our last despatch that the testimony on this point was most CoDf1icting. The next witness examined after the despatch of our report on Friday was- Mr. Henry Turner, station-master at Port Talbot, who deposed that he had the superintendence and direction of the telegraph at Port Talbot, and had received a copy of the general instructions to the officers employed on the line. On Wednesday last, about 10 minutes to 10 c'olock in the morning, the engine of the Irish cattle train arrived at Port Talbot, when he learned that one of the trucks bad broken down on the down line. On this witness immediately directed Barney, the office-porter, to telegraph to the station. master at Stormy to stop all trains at that station until he heard from him. Did not remain to see it done, but went to collect men and materials, and proceeded to the broken-down train, not waiting for ananswer from Stormy. Ie returned to Port Talbot station a few minutes before 12 o'clock, when on arriving at the broken-down train he was informed that the down passenger train was detained at Pyle. When he reached Port Talbot on his return the up train had arrived. After he had ascertained that the down train was at Pyle, and as the damaged train was in order to proceed to Port Talbot, he sent a man back to Pyle to order the passenger train to come on slowly, and when he arrived at Port Talbot be saw three up-trains waiting there to proceed on their journey, viz, a goods' train (which had been puLt into a siding), the 7 5 passenger train (on the up line), and a coal train (on the down line). When he came to the station (Port Talbot) he held up his arm, giving the signal "aaU right " to the parties at the station to start their train on, and thereupon it came slowly on towards him, and he told the engine driver and guard that It was all right, and that they were to drive on. The train then proceeded on the up line at its accustomed speed, and after allowing sufficient time the express followed, and witness proceeded with his ordinary duties. After the two up trains had started, as he had just described, he received a telegraphic message from Mr. Clarke at Swansea to know if the 6230 passenger down train from Cheltenbam had arrived at Port Talbot. This was communi. cated to him by Mr. Evans, the clerk ; he sent no reply to Mr. Clarke, and intended to have gone on the engine which he had in the yard to look after it. He then heard of the accident that had happened through a person riding through the place in search of a surgeon. When he returned from the accident to the goods train be inquired of Mr. Evans what answer had been reeelved from 8tormy to the first telegraphic message, and the answer was-" We under. stand ; all right." Ee had directed the passenger and other train to start before lie heard of the accident. When he left the place where the trucks were damaged he expected the down passenger train to have proceeded on the down line, the down line being free when he sent the verbal message by a porter named Afainwaring to Pyle. Had the down passenger train proceeded on its right line no accident would have occurred. Could not say whether the messenger whose name was Mainwaring had delivered the message at Pyle before the train started. Thought it was not his duty, under his written instructions, to ascertain what answer had been returned from Stormy in reply to his telegraphic message, before he signalled the up passenger train at Port Talbot to proceed; and this because he had remedied the obstruction on the down line, and he thought the train would have folowed him on the down line. Barney, the office-porter, worked the telegraph daily. The message from witness to Pyle for the down train to proceed was verbal. There was no orossing at Pyle by which a train could get from one linto to the other, and in order to do so the down train must return to Stormy. Received the message from Mr. Clarke, about 2 o'clock. Had not telegraphed to Mr. Clarke at all that morning. The down train was clear by about 15 or 20 mlinutes to 1 o'clock, and he arrived at the station yard at about 12, having been absent about two hours. In the meantime he had left Evans, the station-clerk, and Barney In charge of the station. The words whioh he used In his directions to Barnev were " to telegraph Stormy to stop all down trains until he heard from me." Gave directions for no other mmasage to Stormy, and was not personally aware of any message having been received from Stormy. If the message delivered by him to Barnes was sent immediately, it would have arrived in time to enable the Stormy station. master to stop the down train. His directions to Pyle were to take up the detonators and the train to come on. Henry Barney, office-porter at Port Talbot statloa, had been in the service of the company from the 4th of September, and had been instructed in the working of the telegraph by the company's officer. On Wednesday, by direction of Mr. Turner, tho station-master, he forwarded a message from Port Talbot to Stormy in these words:-" Ston all 1ai'Q tll yon hear from Xr. Turner. Goods train broken downr." Called by the telegraph to Stormy from two minutes to 10 o'clock until 25 minutes past 10 before he got a signal from them that they heard him. He then had the reply, "Passenger has left," which meant that the down I passenger train bad left. It was about half-past 10 o'clock when he got this reply. When the reply came Mr. Turner had gone to get the line clear where the goods train had broken down. Evans, the station-clerk, also sent a message to Stormy on the double-needle instrument at half-past 10 to stop all trains until they heard from Mr. Turner, and he asked, "Do you understand?" The reply was "Yes." After that he teleeraphed to Stormy, "Where is down pas. senger train?" The only reply he got was, "Passenger left." He repeatedly telegraphed the question to Stormy, " Where is down passenger train?" and could get no answer, but Stormy several times rang his (Port Talbot's) telegraph bell, and when he answered he could get no message to It. He asked this question at least five or six times; could conscientiously say six times, and he got no reply. By Mr. Tripp.-Was not aware that Evans, the clerk, had despatched or received any other message to or from Stormy. Called the attention of Robertson, the guard of the up train, which was waiting at the Port Talbot station, to the fact of the bell ringing from Stormy, and then no information being sent. Was sure the last ringing of the I bels was from 10 miiiutes to a quarter of an hour betore the I up train was despatched. The guard of the up train wanted the clerk Evans to let him proceed on his journey, but Evans refused, saying he had been ordered to stop all trains, and he would not send any on until he saw or heard from Mr. Turner. By the Jury.-No register is kept of the messages sent on the single needle instrument, but believe there is a register kept of those sent on the double needle instrument, which was not in witness's charge. Edgar Evans, station-clerk at Port Talbot, was employed at Port Talbot first on Fridav last, having been previously eniployed for about eight weeks at Swansea In the superintendent's office and the goods departmcnt and parcel office. Had been altogether nine weeks in the South Wales Company's service, and 18 months in the Electric Telegraph Company's service. The witness corroborated the evidence of Barney as to the message sent by him at 10 35 to Stormy to stop all trains, and the ringing of the Stormy bell. He added that there was no telegraph instrument-single or double-at Pyle station ; there was at one timae, but it had been removed. The telegraph was in perfect order that morning. Mr. Charles White (who was in the up train and received some injuries) deposed that he had been station-master at Storny about twelvemonths, and understood the working of the telegraph. On Wednesday, at about 10 10 am. he received a telegraphic message from Port Talbot," Stop all down trains." There was also an inquiry on the double needle instrument whether he understood it, and he replied that he did lunderstand it. The down passenger train had passed Stormy at that time, but he went Into the yard and gave directions to stop all other down trains. While in the yard the tunder guard of the down train carne back from Pyle and reported that his train was stopped at Pyle, and witness communicated this to Port Talbot, and ordered him to stop till he heard further. He then telegrauhed to Port Talbot, asking how long the down-line was likely to be obstructed, but could not get them to understand his first word " How." Had found before that some of the people at Port Talbot could not understand his messages so well as others; but the prncipal part of the messages came from Port Talbot to h,Oand not from him to Port Talbot. Finding they could not understand on this instrument, he telezraphed on the double one, " Can down train go to P'ort Talbot on up linee" This was a few minutes after he first saw the guard of the down train. The reply from Port Talbot was, " Send down train on up line." This was received immediately in reply to his question. He then told the under guard what message he had received, and sent him to Pyle to bring the train back; he also replied to Port Talbot, "Good ; I will do so." Believed this message was sent on the double needle instrument. After the guard had gone back to Pyle he followed hin), thinking that the driver would not proceed on the up line without a written order. He therefore wrote in pencil an order for the driver in the following terms:-" October 14th. Thomas Gunnell,-Go back from Pyle to Stormy, and return thence to Port Talbot on up line. I will accompany you." When the drver brought his train to Stormy witness wrote a copy of this order for the driver in ink. omitting the words " I wFill accompany you." While at Pyle he left a policeman, Days, in charge of the office, with instructions to send to Port Talbot to say that the train was coming down on the up line. Days tried to send the message, but could not make them understand it. Saw him making the attempt. When he first arrived at Pyle he sent the under guard with detonating signals on in the direction of Port Talbot, to put on the up line in case he should meet anythina to stop their proceeding. He was not to lay down the signals unless he saw anything qpming He was to go on as fast as he could until the dox train overtook him. When he returned to Stormy and attempted to telegraph " Down train now leaving on up line " he could not make them understand. He then got on the engine and directedthe down train to proceedontheupline. Told the driver to proceed and to stop at Pyle to see if any passengers were left behind. He did not stop at Pyle, but went slowly, and the booking olerk there signalled " all right." At the time the accident occurred the down train was going at the rate of about eight miles an hour, They had s ack. ened speed because they saw the steam of an up train at least two miles off approaching them. By the Jury.-No one saw the telegraphic message "Send down train on up line " but myself ; but as soon at it was complete I told the guard. I don't suppose there could have been any mistake, or that the telegraph was out of order, 2 he bell could not have been ringing for 10 or 12 minutes continnously without my knowing of it. Can give posi. tivo evidence that Port Talbot expected a down train on the up line. Foreman of the Jar.-That will be moet important evidence. Witness added that he *umped off the engine just before the coision took place. Had seen the approaching up train five minutes before the collision took place. The driver of the down train shut off the steam, put on the break whistle, and reversed the engine. Daniel Buckle, porter at Swansea station, was working as under-guard on the down train from Cheltenham on the day of the accident. They ran down through the Pyle station, and then stopped and returned to the station, a messenger I having arrived from the direction of Port Talbet to order the train to stop, as a goods train had broken down, and , they were not to go on until another messenger I arrived. Witness had orders from the head guard to o up to Lynnvi junction (Stormy) to inform them Chore that a goods train had broken down and to stop everything. He went, accordingly, to Stormy and told Mr. White, the stationmaster there, on which he said, " Your train had better come back and go dowxn on the u line." He then went away to a policeman, and witness followed him to the station, where he saw Mr. Wrhite working the telegraph. After waiting a few minutes Mr. White turned round and said, " Yes, you had better go back and bring your train and go down on the up line." Witness replied, "Very well. Sir; you ston everything comaing dow n," and he said, " All right." Witness then returned back to Pyle, and Mr. White overtook him as he got there and gave orders to the driver to go back to Stormy, at the same time ordering witness to go on towards Port Talbot and stop all up trains. Witness went on as fast as he could, and when he had got a mile and a-quarter he met a messenger coming back to say the down line was clear again, but he did not know whether the up train had been detained at Port Talbot while the dove train ran on the up line. Witness then went on, and 3 d left the messenger a-quarter of a mile when he saw tee up train apuroaching. He hurried on untilhe got to a bridge called Pyle bridge, where he put down a detonator, and 50 or 60 yards further he put down another. In the meantime he heard the break whistle of the down train coming, and the up train was approaching round a curve. As soon as he had put down the detonator be signalled the up train to stop, and the driver pat on his break whistle. The train then passed him, and ho could not say what time elapsed until the collision occurred, hut he was 40 or 50 yards from the trains at the time. By the Jury.-When I told Mr. White that one train was stopped at Pyle and that a goods train had broken down, he said " Well, you had better go down on the up line." He did not say he had received orders to send the train down the up line. It is nearly half an hour's walk from Pyle to Stormy. William Forshaw, enginedriver on the Great Western Railway, was driver of the up goods train from Swansea, arriving at Port Talbot at about 10 minutes to 11 o'clook. We waited there an hour and six minutes. Our train was stopped outside of Port Talbot station, because the Irish cattle train bad broken down. The policeman who stopped us said we were to stop where we were, as they had telegraphed from Stormy that the down train was coming on the up line to Port Talbot. Did not know the policeman's name, but should know him again. His fireman (Webster) and under-guard (Morgan) were present at the time. A coal train afterwards came up on the same line of rails, and we were ordered to move on further, the policeman stating that the down passenger train would not be likely to ran into us as it would come very slowly, being on the wrong line. They accordingly proceeded on, keeping a good lookout. After some time the third class up passenger train arrived, and the coal train crossed on the down line to make room for the passenger train. The three trains waited there about a quarter of an hour, when the broken-down Irish goods' train came up, and before it arrived at the station there were three or four persons signalled " all right" for the passenger train to start, and the driver of the passenger traan, seeing i the signal, went on his journeyup towards l1yle. Our train was due to start before the passenger train, but was detained on account of the break-down of the Irish train. About five mlnutes after the passenger train had started we followed it, and on arriving at Pyle bank saw that the two trains had come in collision. The witness described the policeman, and Mr. I.angdon said there was no ,doubt he' was the regular day policeman stationed at this point. Thomas Webster, fireman of the goods train detained at Port Talbot, corroborated the tstimony of the last witness in chief. The inquest was then adjourned to Monday. It is satisfactory to state that most of the other sufferers from the collision are progressing favourably. The names of the other deceased persons upon whose bodies inquests will be held next week are Mrs. Israel, of Pyle, whose case was referred to in T7he Times of Thursday as " an aged woman, name unknown," and as havln received Internal injuries. She is supposed to have been thrown with great violence against the seat opposite to that on which she was seated. It is but justice to state that the most valuable aid was rendered to the sufferers by a gentleman connected with the Bristol and Exeter Railway who happened to be in one of the trains and was unhurt, and who exerted himself in the most praiseworthy manner to relieve the sufferings of the injured and to remove them to places of safety. Ar. Mortimer, of the rolling stock department of the South Wales Railway at Swansea, accompanied the express engine to the spot, and superlntended the removal of the injured to Swansea, which was accomplished as quickly as possible.
ELECTION CA-VASSERS' ExPENSES.-At the last sitting of the Wakefield County Court, Mr. George Moore, draper. of Wakefield, brought an action against Yr. West. moreland, solcitor, to recover the smn of 491. for time lost and expenses incurred during 21 days' canvassing at the late election for Mr. Charlesworth, the present Conservative member for Wakefield. The defendant was about to leave Waakefield to set up businiess on his own account, but was prevailed upon by the defendant to stop and canvass for his client, promising that whatever charge the plaintiff made should be paid. He accordingly stayed and canvassed, and his bill for 21 days, at two guineas a-day and expenses, amounted to the sum claimed, wbich the defendant alleged was exorbitant. It was shown that the defendant had been offered two guineas a-day and expenses to canvass for Mr. Oliveira at Pontefract, and that after completing his engagement at Wakefield he did canvass for Mr. Oliveira for that rate of payment. It was also showin that Mr. Ferns, solicitor, of Leeds, was engaged by Mr. Oliveira at 10 guineas a-day, and that a Mr. Lamb canvassed for him for 5 guineas a-day. The Judge said that as no professional man had been called to prove that the plaintiff's charge was exorbitant, he considered that the plaintift had made out his case, and the verdict would be for 4'J!., with costs of witnesses and attorney. TuE SIAMIESE AMBASSADGRS.-We learn from our Malta correspondent that among the passengers on board Her Majesty's despatch steamer Caradoc, which arrived at Malta on the 8th ult., were the three Siamese Ambassadors, -Phgor Montri Snriywsmgsi, Chamun Sulbedh Chaity, and Chamun Mix Dir Bidacks-accompanied by a numerous suite. Upon their arrival they were saluted by Her Majesty's ship Elibernia and afterwards by Fort St. Angelo. They were received at the palace by his Excellency the Governor, Sir William Reid,andRear-Admiral Sir Montagu Stopford, wnth thesr respective stafiS. Their Excellencies took up their abode at the Iniperlal Hotel, much, it is said, to their dissatisfaction, as they expected they would have baen the guests, according to the custom of their country of tho Governor. In the evening, attendedby CommanderCiaverin R.N., of the Caradoc, they were present in the Governos5 box at the opera, where the richness and novelty of their costume attracted much attention, and on the following morning Lieutenant-Generai Sir John Pennefather had the troops out in review order on the Fiolana parade ground, in honour of their nrrival. Their Excellencies were to leave Maldata by the Catadoc for England direct on the 10th
COURT OF BANTWBuPTcY, B"ing7,a1 strcd, Oct. 17. INT RE THE ROYAL SURREY OAR e,n -vf-fW (Before 3fr. COmmAkiA.n-V ls AI This was an adjourned meeting for taking into consideration a petition that a windlng-up order against the company be made absolute. Mr. A. Jones appeared for Mr. Coppock and other direoc tors; Mr. Fleming, Mr. Chidley, Mr. F. W. Chappell, and Mr. Levy for shareholders. Notwithstanding that all parties concurred in asking for an adjournment until some day after the 2d of November, when a newly appointed committee would make a report in respect to the best couree to be pursued, a most protracted, and wsngling discussion was got up, which, so far as it contained any matter of lnterest to the public, or any practical result to the directors and shareholders, might almost as well have been a discussion among a number of the most talkativeboirdsevercontainedinthesurrey gardens. Adescrip. tive summary is consequently the best form of notice. In opposition to the directors it was urged that some conditions should be attached to the order of adjournment; that the directors had stolen a march upon the shareholders by increaslng the number of directors from four to eight ; that, although at the last meeting of shareholders a committee had been appointed, the report of that committee might not be an impartial report, or a report that could be acted upon. Three of the new directors, it was urged, were gentlemen who had joined in a wish that a ballot might be taken at a recent meeting, and that, if such ballot had been taken, Mr. Coppock, with 110 votes in his pocket could have carried any resolution he pleased, all the votes held by all the other shareholders present amounting to only about 80 in number. Only the strong feeling manifested had preventec this ballot. The directors had committed a breach of faith in respect to acting upon the understanding at the last meeting in this court. The new committee appointed consisted only of sit on one side and half-a dozen on the other. The attachment of such conditions to the order was necessary as itmight prevent the directors doing anything antagonistio to the wishes of shareholders until the next meeting in this court. Suppose that the committee reported that new directors were advisable, the answer would be-" You cannot appoint them-we are full." The directors ought to be put upon terms, The shareholders were charged with making too much noise; but they might weU make a noise, having lost all their money. (A laugh.) The gardens were mortgaged, and the mortgagee might at any moment step in and close his mortgage. That would render any meeting useless. The mortgagee had given notice to sell already. A copy of Mr. Tyler's assinment of the gardens had been applied for, but Llr. Jones had not furnished it. For the directors it was urged that the annexation of conditions to an adjournment was unnecessary, and must prove as futile as unnecessary. What could be the use of putting the directors under terms If they would not be put under terms. (Laughter.) The large shareholders were placed in an unfavourable position, not the zaalcontents. Under the partnership deed the holder of one share had the same extent of voting power as the holder of 10 shares. The committee first appointed by the malcontent shareholders was a self-elected clique. At a public meeting the holder of many shares had but one throat, the same as the holder of but one share had only one throat; but the latter generally made the greater noise. (Laughter.) The last appointed committee consisted, not of six on one side and half-a-dozen on the other, as alleged, but of nine who were favourable to the views of the shareholders and of only three who were favourable to the di. rectors. The allegation that Mr. Coppock could carry any resolution he mlght deem advirablo was not true, he commanding only 1lu votes, while there were altogether 380 votes. There was not the slightest intention to foreclose the mortgage. It was not true that Mr. Coppock had ab. stained fiom taldng a vote in consequence of the feeling manifested. A copy of Mr. Tyler's assignment 'would be furnished, It was not an understood condition that the directors should not increase the number of their body. They had met the shareholders with the greatest fairness, The report of the newly appointed committee could not, from the composition of the committee, be unduly favourable to the directors, and the annexation of conditions to the adjournment was wholly uncalled for. TheCommssioNxsaid,heobjectedto hearin long stories without being first told to what they tended. It had been necessary to interrupt that course of procedure. If shareholders were too idle to be present at meetings they could not afterwards coniplain of having been out-voted. It was suggested that Mr. Coppock having a giant's strength might use it as a giant, but he could not see why the minority of interest should prevail over the majority. The construction of the newly-appointed committee appeared to be fair enough. There were durinR the proceedings interruptions of "No, no." If that course were persevered in he would ?nit the court altogether. He did not approve the term I clique,I or the callig of names in a court of jusice. It seemed to him hard tt a gentlemnan who held only one 10. share should possess the same voting power as the holder of ten 101. shares. It was much the same with this company as at electons. The throat of the non-elector always did make the greatest noise. (A laugh.) He had heard assertion, issue, rejoinder, surrejoinders, and he did not know if there was not a rebutter. There would be an adjournment to Saturday, the 19th of December, without annexation of terms. He would recommend all parties to treat the affair as a matter of business and B. S. d., and put aside feeling. The question for them to consider was,-is there a fair prospect of carrying on the Surrey Gardens with advantage or not. Many things could be exceedingly weU carried on by indvliduals which could only be miserably carerd on by companies.

ZZSOL YENT DEBTORBS' COURT Oct. 17. (Before thc CnI1- COBnjSrSOrER.) This was a sitting for hearing applications for discharge upon sureties and motions. LI; RE SAMIUEL LAY. In this case one of the proposed sureties upon examination said, he was discharged by this Court in 1837, and was bankrupt in 15L He had paid all his debts under the insolvency except one of very small amount; but the warrant of attorney in this coart had not been satisfied. Hle had at the present time ample property to enable him to satisfy all just claims. An attorney, who appeared for the detaining creditor, was satisfied of the solvency of the proposed bail, and offered no opposition. The CIIEF Com£msssIoN said, the insolvent was indebted to the detaining creditor for his discharge upon bail, for had there been any opposition the Court would not have ace pted as surety a man who had a schedule and unsatisfied warrant of attormey still standing in his name.

AIDD=ESEX SE,S-ONS, Oct. 17. The Court sat to-day to hear appeals against convictions. Mr. BLISS, Q.C., presided, and the following magistrates were present :-Mr. Pownall, Chairman of the Bench; Mr. Warner, Mr. Brooking, Mr. Goodhart, Mr. Baylis, Mr. Freer, Dr. Bateman, fr. Fletcher, Mr. Griffiths, and Mr. Yates. CHARLES THORP V. A CONVICTION OF IV. F. BEAD 0N, E9Q. This was an appeal by Charles Thorp, formerly of 124, Jermyn-street, now of the White Bear, Piccadilly, against a conviction for keeping a betting-house, under which he was sentenced to two months' hard labour in the House of Correction. Mr. Bodkin, instructed by the solicitor to the Treasury. appare toan pot t~ cnvition ; Mr. Serjeaut BallantineandMr. .I . Leis,instructed by Mr. S. B. Abrahams, for the appellant. In opening the case Mr. BODKIN said tbh' Legislature having passed an Act to remedy the evils resulting from the betting-houses which were so much complained of, the Government had felt it to be their duty to support the con- iction now appealed against, particularly as the appellant had been before convicted of the same offence. Upon the evdence he thought there could be no doubt of the propriety of the conviction. Inspector Webb, of the C division, stated that on the 4th of May he watched the house 124, Jermyn-street, then in the occupation of the appelant, by whom the shop-door was opened about 10 o'clock in the morning. From 10 to 21 o'clck 20 persons entered and came out ; from 11 to 12 o'clock, 76; from 12 to 1 o'clock, 90; from I to 2 o'clock, 26; from 2 to 3 o'clock, 44. The door was closed at the latter hour, hut at 4 o'clock several persons knocked, and the appellant let them in. The total number was 258, and many of them were known to witness as betting men. He saw the appellant at the window making entries in a book, aud while he was doing so he was surrounded by persons whom witness had seen go in. They had books in their bands. At halfpast 7 o'clock mi the evening he went with the Superintendent of the C division to the house, and on entering they found five persons in front of the bar, upon which stood some decanters of wvine. The appellant was behind the bar, and upon hearing their business (they had a warrant) he hurried away through a back room, and could not afterwards be ound. The five persons standing in front of the bar were searched and taken to the station. house. On searcing the bar he found copies of telegraphic messages relating to races and memoranda of the same kind. In a room on the first floor he found a ledger containing entries of races and the names of horses with igures attached. The honse Ws reglarly frequented by betting men, and the appellant had been there some years. Iwecre madoss.ez tion he said he corld not swear that bets i-eorg Draper, 326 A, deposed to going into the houe In plain clothes on the 4th of May. A person there said to apeln,"What's the price abouLt Leamdlngton 1"AP yaln ad, " 5 to 1." The ienquirer said, " Oan yon notI give maore than that?" to which Tharp replied, "1Well, ifI you want to back him rul give yFol 6 to 1." The per'son then put down a sovereign, and Thorp made an entry in a hook. The man gave the name of Williams. Joseph Ceo late a constable of the D division, and gavo similar testimony. H le saw a bet made of 4 tr, 1 againt a horse caUed Turbit, and on asng the dd ins horse entered for the Cheater Cap, Thorp told him 5 to I1 agaist Leamington, 10 to I against Van Dunck, 20 to 1 against Zigzag. Thorp offered to lay 30 against the lW4 named. The next witness was Superintendent Hannant, who deposed to the appelant escaping when Informed of the nature of his visit to his house' - Kirkby, an elderly-looking man, was next called. He said he wanted to know who was to pay his expenses before he was sworn. He had been kept in town four days, and his expenses were 13s. 6d. a-day. Superintendent Hannant said the witness lived *t Boston in Linco nshire and they went there to serve him with a stbpcena, but they found he was in town, so when he was served he only received is. with the subptna Mr. BODRLN told the witness that the Solicitor to the Treasury would pay all proper and reasonable expenses. Witnegs.-Wel, give me his address; but stop, I don't know any Solcitor to the Treasury, and before I begin I want my expenses, Mr. BoDESu.-You will find ' Solicitor to the Treasury, Whitehall,' on the back of your subpocna. Let me see it. Witness.-Here it is; but here's writing on it of mine which I don't want you tc- see, it's the items of my expenses. I wanti; the money, Sir, that's my ticket. (Laughter.) Mi]r. Bonsux, to the Bench.-Sir, here is a witness before you whose fair and reasonable expenses are guaranteed by the Solicitor to the Treasury, and if he refuses further to give his evidenceI shal ask you to commit Witness.-Well, rather than be committed I'u be?'n, but the Queen is better able to pay my expenses than Iamto lose them. I was "had" once before in a horse case- I was summoned 37 mUea, and was only laughed at afterah I don't mean to be laughed at again like that. Serieant BArLANMTcE.-HC does not appear to have much confidence in Her Majesty's Troasury. Witness,-Not a bit. All the confidence I've got is that I'm confident I mean to be paid. (uoud laughter.) The representative of the Solicitor to the Treasury here stepped up and handed the witness 5L, with which he seemed very well contented. He then deposed,-I am no trade or business, but live on a littlepropery at Boston. In May last Thorp laid me a bet of 60 to 2 that Blink Bonny did not win the Derby and Oaks. I won the bet. It was made at 124, Jermynmstreet; lust at the door. I used to go there to make bets. When I asked him for my money after Blink Bonny had won the two races he said he could not pay as the poHee had taken his books. I produced my own book in which he had written his name, to the bet, but he did not pay me, nor has he yet. He said Imust wait. I have paid him altogether 23L for bets. Cross-examined.-I was once a farmer, but failed. I never had 11 days through falsely stating that I was an inspector of weights and measures. I was once at the assizes 11 days, but I do not know, and never did, rightly, what it was for, but this I know-I was acquitted without the aid of either counselor solicitor. Serjeant BLLA-rm-m.-That's a libel by inference upon the entire profession. (Much laughter.) The witness added that he went to the White Bear the preceding evening, and saw the appellant's solicitor. He did not say he would stay away from the court if 201. were given him, but he said if Thorp would pay him the amount of his bet he would be out of the way. Why should he not, he said. He had no ill-will against Thorp, but he wanted his money for all that. Serjeant BA .NTL2N--YoU are from the north, are you not? 'Witness (winking).-I should say I was, a bit. (Much laughter.) btr Soott, rate colleetor, proved that the kouse 124, Jermyn-street, was rated in the defendant's name, and that he pald the rates. Mr. Serjeant BALLATmIN, in his address to the Bench, said he must confess that he looked to the result of the case with deep anxiety, fraught as it was with the most vital importance to the appellant, who, if tI e conviction were affirmed, would have to undergo the severe eentence of two months' hard labour in a felons' gaol upon a charge not supported by the best proof which the Government could have adduced, and which was not surrouaded by any flagWant or aggravating circumstances. He was addressing the Bench as a court of law, he should also address them as a jury, and, while they would decide the law of the case he should ask them to give the appellant the benefit of any doubt he might be able to raise in their mind as to facts. The statute under which this conviction took place was one of a highly penal nature, and must therefore be strictly construed, and the appellant was justified in resorting to everymeans and argument to extricate himself from the peril in which he was placed. The conviction, he contended, was not drawn up according to the evidence it was made upon. The words of the statute were, "Any person being the occupier of any house, room, office, or other place." This conniction was for " alcertain house." Now, it was clear that the prosecution had the right to elect, and the conviction ought to have been for "a room," for the evidence was that it was in a room that the betting took place, and where was the strictly legal and conclusive evidence that such room was an actnal part of the house of which Thorp had been the occnpier? The conviction was for" a house"y' the evidence apphed only to a room or shop, which might be distinct from the appelant's house. He must admit that there was no grave question upon facts; buzt in such a penal matter every point must be scrutinized most strictly. Where was the evidence that Thorp's house was used for betting, as the conviction allezed. Persons went there for other purposes, and if even betting had been going on there was no grave criminality on Thorp's part, but he had been selected from a crowd. The same thing was done in higher classes, who were left unscathed, and indulged in this vice with impunity, while a person like Mr. Thorp was to undergo the severe and terrible punishment of being seat to associate with felons in a common gaol. He submitted that there was a link wanting in the case on the part of the Crown which was fatal to the conviction. Mr. BLISS said, the Bench were unanimously of opinion that the conviction was good and must be confirmed. As to the legal arganent of the learned serjeant he would say that If a person had a house and tsed a room in it for the purposes of betting, in his opinion It was using that house within the meaning of the statute. The appelant was then taken into custody to undergo the 8entence. Mr. Henry G. Bohn, the] publisher, appealed against a maisterial order made under the Nuisances' Removal Act. The matter of complaint was that the rain-water pipes of Mr. Bohn's warehouse in White Hart-street, Drury-lane, were not connected with the common sewer. After a short discussion it was arranged that the parish should (lo what was required, Mr. Bohn payingl10., and the order was quasshed by consent. Mr. Sleigh appeared for the appellant, Mr. Le Breuon for the parish. Frederick Squires appealed against a like order made by Mr. C. 0. Dayman. Mr. Prentice and Mr. Poland appeared in support of the order, Mr. Ribton and Mr. Salter for the appellant. The order in this case related to a place at Notting-hill called the Potteries, where about 1,200 pigs were kept, by which, it was alleged, a most intolerable nuisance was created in the neighbourhood, increasing the rate of mortality. The case was decided not upon its merita, but upon a preliminary objection taken by Mr. Ribton. Mr. Prentice said a fresh order would be obtained.
POLICE. MAsIoIN-Hor.Sz-One of the committee of the East London Shoeblack Society attended at the Mansion-house, and addressing the LORD MAYOR said, it was the wish of himself and his brother committeemen that the operations of the society should be extended to placiug 12 crossingsweepers in uniform at certain spots in the city, but under the direction of the police; and he asked the sanction of the Lord Mayor to this proceeding. The LoRD MAYOR.-Is this application for the purpose of making an experiment? Applicant.-Yes. The LORD MAYOR.-I have entertained a favourable opinion of this project for a long time past. I think that not only a dozen boys, but some hundreds of poor persons might be engaged in this occupation in different parts of the netropolis Applicant.-The boys that we at present employ belong to the destitute classes. They receive a certain training and instruction, and we do not put them upon any station until we have ascertained that they are trustworthy. The LORD MLAOR.-I feel perfectly convinced that the scheme you propose will answer. Nobody can fail to be impressed with the immense benefit which must necessarily result from taking destitute persons from the streets, many of them the victims of misfortune, and, in addition to employing them in the daytime, rescuing them from evening temrptations and educating them. I will communicate to the Commissioner of Police the wishes of the society, and let you know the result. The applicant thanked his Lordship and withdrew. GCILDnALL.-George Paynter Priestley was, on remand, charged with being concerned in a robbery upon Lady Shaw, of 8, Kensington-gore. On Wednesday evening last Lady Shaw attended a meeting held by the Rev. Canon Dale at his schoolroom in St. Pancras for the benefit of the sufferers by the Indian mutinies. Her ladyship was accompanied by several friends, and on leaving the meeting she was about to call a cab when she missed her portemonnaie containing two swereigns and a check for 51., and a worsted purse containing 81. in gold and two 61.-notes, besides some loose change and other articles. HXer pocket had been completely emptied. Lady Shaw sent information to boare's hank in Fleet-street, and on the following morning the check for 561 was presented by the prisoner and stopped, the prisoner being given into custody at the same time. On being asked how he obtained the check he said it was given to him by a man who promised him 5s. if he got it cashed. A barber named Pinchback, living in Osborne-street, Whitechapel, said he knew the prisoner as a customer, and he was shavin him on the morning in question, when a man came in acd ave the prisoner something and asked him to go with it, but the witness could not say what the man referred to. The prisoner said, he could prove an alibi, as he was in Pinchbeck's shop at tho time the robbery was committed. Alderman GABRIEL said, he would commit the prisoner for trial on two charges-viz., forstealing the portemonnaie andylurse containing the moneys of Lady Shaw, and for receiving the 54 check knowing it to be stolen. The prsoner, who displayed some anxiety as to when he should be tried, was tLen removed. WORsmP-STRXET.-On Saturday James Roberts and amesPands, described respectivaly as an engineer and a lerk, but both suspected to be ticket-of-leave men, were charged with the following dexterous robbery. George Garner, an unemployed compositor, was in beward.street, Spitalfields7 on Monday evening, the 12th ,, when, a cab passed hims wlth two portinanteaus upon the roo, of which he took some notice. A few minutes after the prisoner Roberts passed him with a large port manteau in front of him, which he first put down in a door wAY and then moved It beneath a window and walked away leaving it there. Garner thought the best thing he could do was to take care of the trunk, and he did so till Hudson, a constable, came up, to whom he pointed it out and told what he had seen, and also pointed oat Roberts, who had JUst made his roappearance three doors off, as the man who had placed it there. Roberts, on seeing himself indicated, took fast to his heels, but was pursued, captured, and lodged in the station,where, on being identified by Garner, he denied it stoutly, and abueed Gardner indignantly. With a good deal of trouble the constable discovered the owner afterwards, who proved to be a German gentleman named Fraudentheil, residing at Hibernia-viUlas, Dalston, who stated that on the morning of the day in questioa ho went to the St. Katherine's-docks to meet his two sisters, who were coming to this country from Hamburg, and on their reaching the wharf at 5 o'clock placed them in a cab, and their luggage on the top of it, part of the luggage consisting of a portmanteau filled with dies' dresses and jewelry, worth at least 301. On reaching Fort-street, Hughes, the cabman, who had seen the luggage safe at the corner of Ste-ward-street, turned rouna aggain to look at it, and though only a few yards further on then found that one of the trunks had been stolen. Three men wero standing together, one of whom, on seeing the cab stop, ran away, and the cabman anxiously inquired of the other two whether they had seen the box. BEth men aid they had seen it stolen, and Rands, who was one of them, offered to show him the way the thief had taken. He left his cab to follow them, but instead of taking him to Steward-street they took him to Spitalfields church where the second man slipped away, and Rands seemed inclned to do so too, but was seized by Hughes, who held him tightly tll a constable came up, on seeing whom Rands made a desperate gpring and tried to esca"e but was seized by the officer and lodged in the station als. On the road to the station he quietly observed to the officer, "Ah, the cabman thinks he is very clever, but he did not see the box taken off the cab, and I'l pay him out to-morrow." li was contended by Mr. Wontuer, for Rands, that it was an entire mistake as far as his client was concerned, as it was manifest he might easily have escaped had he chosen to do so, or been uilty of the offence, while the cabman was deseending from his box, but 306 K deposed to his know. ledge of Robers, and 81 E to his knowledge of Rands, both of whom they believed to have been before convicted, and the prisonea were therefore committed for the completion of the depositions, and that the officers might have time to ascertai their antecedents. CLEKEWEL.A respectably dressed young man who gave the name Of Collins was eharged with stealing eome property of his master, a draper of Isliongiton Mr. a ohn Wakedi nt appeared for the prosecution. From the evidence It appeared that the prisoner had been for the last three or four years in the employ of the prosecutor, and had up to the present time borne an irreproehable character. A few days since he was seen by the police to htve some property in his poseession w hch they did not think was his own, and upon speaking to him upon the matter he admitted that he had taken the articles for the purpose of meeting some betting labilities which he had incurreto . Some bets he had won, but the parties pith whom he had made the beta were now 7mn eo ic The prisoner, in defence said, he was very sory, and admitted that he had been led into the commission of the offence through getting mixed up weith betting transacions, MIr. Tyxwmr said, he should remand the prisoner for a few days. The position of the prisoner ought to be a lesson to young men who like the prisoner had got mixed up w ith horseracing and betting men. Notwithstanding whit the Legislature had done for the purpose of puatting the practice of betting down it Was stil carried on to a great extent, and raw Ignorant bosmih now be seen makeig bets in the publichighway. There could be no doutbt but that many of te crimes daily committed were commenced with betting, and halh of those who went to places of pleasure took the money out of their masters' tills. If masters did not poe cute inall cases they were in a very awkward position, andi they might depend upon it that more evil would come of it. The prisoner, who seemed to feel his position very acutely, was then removed. SOUTHWA1P..-A respectable-looking young German, named Blume Leist, a traveller to a mercantile firm in the city, was brought before Mr. CO.BE, charged with threatening the life of a young lady whose name did not trauspire. He was also charged with threatening to commi suicide. .nn ocmi Susan Dathwatte, a coffeehouse keeper in Great Suffolkstreet, in the vicinity of this court, stated that sho had known the prisoner as a customer about nine months, and until lately she believed him to be a quiet, inoffensive young man, On Fsiday morning he came to her house and was supplied with a cup of coffee. He was in a very excited and nervous state. She asked him what was the matter with him, when he said he had been disappointed in a young lady who he believed would have married him, and that he was determined that she should have no one else but him, as he would have her life. Witness told him to be more ealm and not think anything more of the young lady, when he took a large knife from his pocket and, opening the blade, said he would blow her brains out =nd afterwards cut his own throat. He then went out of the house in a very violent manner, and believing that he would carry his threats into execution she foUlowed him and gave him into custody to a police-constable. Mx. CO=BE asked the witness whother there was any truth in his paying his attention to a young lady ? She repled that she believed that he had done so, but his addresses were not received. In answer to the charge the prisoner said, he was sorry for maklng use of the expressions, but he had no Intention of carrying the threats into execution. He had certainly been paying his addresses to a young lady, and on her dis. carding him he felt very vexed, and in a moment of excitement made use of the threats. Mr. COsrBE asked him what business he was ? He replied that he was traveUer to Messrs. Benson, merchants, in the city, but he should not like them to know his present position. I answer to Mr. COmIBE Mrs. Dathwaite said she really believed he intended to carry his threats into execution, as he was very much. excited, and went in the direction of the young lady's house. Mr. COMmE told the prisoner that after such evidence he could not allow him to be set at liberty. He must find bail for three months, and when at the gaol the doctor and minister would ascertain his real state of mind. A short well-dressed man, whose name appeared on the charge-sheet as the Rev. Mr. Prettyman, was charged with being drunk and incapable in the public street. Police-constable 74 M said, he was on duty on Friday night in Tooley-streetwhen he saw the gentleman lying about drunk and incapable, surrounded by a bad lot, who would have stripped him had he not arrived and taken him for safety to the police-station. Mr. ComBE (to the defendant).-What are you? Defendant.-I am a merchant, Sir, and I don't know how I got into this plight. Tfr.CO3m0E.-Why, you are entered on the charge-sheet asaclergyman. Howisthat? The Inspector.-HTe said he was a clergyman, Sir, and in his pocket was a manuscript sermon which he said he was going to preach on Sunday next at a church in the city. Defendant.-Well, that is true enough. That is my sermon, and I shall preach it on Sunday; perhaps your worship will llke to come and hear it. It will do you good, Sir. (Laughter.) M1r. ComBE.-If you are a clergyman it is a disgraceful position for you to be placed in. What have you to say in answer to the charge? Defendant.-Nothing. I don't think I was drunk. It must have been a fit. M.r. ComaBx.-Yes, a fit of drunkenness. You must pay the drunkard's fine of 5s. Defendant (throwing down the money).-Well, there is the 5s.- it'll only De 5s. less in the plate to-morrow. Mr. (OlIBE.-YOU are discharged, and if you are a parson I should advise you to keep sober and mind your sermon. Defendant.-Oh, I'll take care of that. Good-bye, Sir. He then left the court apparently not recovered from the fumes of the liquor which he had imbibed.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-On philological principles I am afraid that the "anti-telegram party" must carry the day. Mr. Walford is easily disposed of. There can be no such verb at 7qXEypa;Ow, and consequently no such derivative as 7?IX7ypaqtua. It is only when compounded with prepositions that the simple form of the verb can be used, as cla-pwpfiow, a-lyphfiw-. With adverbs, as with nouns, a form in t/w is invariable. Thus we have Xoyoypaoiw, UVOoypapiw, 7xOypaXiaiW, KaXXtypaoiw, forms of whieh Mr. WValford seenis never to have heard. A passive noun from thesw would takethe form yp6oljlta, as In Uwf,6;s za, a painting. The only verb I find conipounded with ri7Xp is rqXt3oX;(w-a case in point. No classicel author would have used the word -rqXq3(zXXw. Mr. Sbllleto's miPas ypLw (telegrapherue) is therefore perfectly correct. i Telegram" is no doubt a useful word, but it must give up all claim to etymological accuracy. X.

Tug RlSrN;( PROSI'ERITY OF B1RKENI{.AD.- LiVERiPOOL, Oct. 16.-- Mach of the rising importance and prosperity of Bilrkenhead is attributed in that town to the exertions of Mr. John Laird, the eminent iron ship. builder, who throuigh good report and ill report has looked forwa.d to, and helped the advent of, better days for thatl town. As some mark of the appreciation of the inhabitants, a testimonial fund for that gentleman has been made. The amoant collected having now arrived at upwards of 500l., it was resolved at a meeting of the sacbecribejrs held last (Thursday) night that the suut in hand should be expended in a servIce of plate to be presented to Mr. Laird on an early occasion. AN2;r;1.f0-S.f xK SEIULTCtE.-A very singiilar aid, it is believed, unique mode of interment bas recently been discovered by Mr. Akernan, secretary of the Society of Antiquaries, while engaged in antiquariaa researches in an Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Brighthampton, near Witney, Oxon. In a grave only two feet deep lay the skeleton of a man, measuzing six feet sia inches long ; an iron spear' head by the left ear, a knife in the lap, and the left haud still gras pIng the handle of the umibo of a shield. The skeleton lay with the head due east, the exact reverse of the direction of the bodies in Anglo.Saxon graves, which are generally found with the head to the west. Beneath the skeleton, and In close contact, lay the remains of a womuan, her heai resting under the legs of the man, and her ieet under his head. Near the skull of the lower skeleto, war fonnd a hAir-pin of bronze, on the breast a broas fibula, and in the lap, where the bands were placed nine amibr beads of unusually large size, which had prrubably forrried bracelets.

THE RBBORMATORY MOPVEMBEN. A large and influential meeting in support of the Reformiatory and Industrial Schools movement, supported by the National Reformatory Union and the Reformatory and Rdfuge Union, was held at the Town hall, Birmingham, on Thursday evening. It was presided over by Mr. W. F. Cowper, MP., Vice-President of the Coimtnitteeof Councilon Education, and was attended by most of the distinguished visitors who wero present in the town in connexion with the Social Science Association. About 4,000 persons filled the body of the hail, and among those on the platform were Lord Brougham, Lord J. Russell, Lord Stanley, Lord Calthorpe, Lord Ingestre, Sir J. Pakington, Mr. C. B. Adderley, M.P., Mr. R. Hanbury, MP., lr. Slaney, f.P., Mr. Garuett, M.P., the Recorder of Birminghama (Mr. M.D. Hill), the Mayor of Birmingham (air. J. Ratoliff), the Honand Rev. G. Ycrke, the Hon. and Rev. W. Lyttleton, Dr Livingstone, Mr. Robert Owven, Mr. J. Starge, Mr. T. B. Baker, Rev. Sydney Turner, Mir. J. C. Symons, Mr. C. Wren Hoskyns, the Rev. Dr. Miller, Dr. Davies, Mr. C. H. Bracebridge, Mr. R. Chambers, the Mayor of Northampton, and a large number of clergymen and gentlemen from the neighbourhood. The CRAIRMUN introduced the subject to the meeting at considerable length. Notwithstanding, he said, the number of criminals who had broken the lavr from the urgent pressure of temptation or sudden gusts of passion we might to some extent speak of crime as a profession, to which there was an apprenticeship and an advance through successive stages of prcficiency tiUl the summit of outrage and criminrality was reached. It was Interesting to investigate the causes and provocation to this criminal course. The most common was the absence of care and good influence at home, whether from the negligence, dissuluteness and drunkenness, or wickedness of the parents, or from orphanage and-a very prolific source of misery to cbildren-a crnel or hard step. mother who allowed no comfortable shelter to her children. The want of education had been generally considered a principal cause of crime, but yet the returns showed that of the persons committed for offences for a long period not more than one-third were unable to read and write. This might seem to go against the conclusion that want of education led to crme, but it did not. When they spoke of education preventing crime, they meant it in its fullest sense, comprehending the development of all the faculties mental, moral, and religious-not merelylessonsin the alpha. bet, grammar, writing, and arithmetic-which are but the mere implements and tools of useful knowledge. The education of daUly life, of home, of the street, of companions was that which promoted or prevented the entrance of a child into the profession of crime. For instance, the children of the metropolis or large towns sent a much larger propor. tion to gaols and reformatories than those who lived in vllUages and scattered cottages ; not because they had less schooling or leEs knowledge of reading and writing, or less intelligence-they had probably more, but because the whole moral atmosphere around them was as polluted and as Injurious as that physical atmosphere which typified it -because in their homes they were crowded together in indecent proximity, because in their street games their evil companions took the lead. This was strikingly illustrated by a remarkable paper contributed by Mr. J. Symons, in which he showed that the amount of crime in counties and towns was in proportion not to the prevalence or deficiency of schooline, but in very close and directproportion to the density of the population in question. Alter quoting some of the statistics adduced by Mr. Symons in proof of this position, the right hon. gentleman referred to the influence exerted by ragged schools, defendIng the course of the Government, however, in not granting them large amounts of public money. Such assistance could on'r be given by them, coupled with conditions. You should ascertain first of all that the proper class of children were admitted; secondly that the sehools were piaced where they were wanted; and, thirdly,that the education given In them was thoroughly effective. With regard to reformatories, the aid furnished by Parliament to these institations was of great importance, but still volunteer efforts in this direction, made with a heartiness exerting an influence which did not accompany paid labour, could not be dispensed with. In this great reformatory movement which they were met to discuss he recognized one of the bright features of our social condition, and he was thanklul to see so large an audience, and men of such eminence, met to support it. (Cheers.) Lord BROuGIArAx (who was enthusiastically re'eived) said,-I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that I deem it a very high honour to be caUed upon by my right hon. friend who so worthily presides over us this evening to move the first resolution. It is impossible for any one to have had the exp-rience wbiich I nnhappily have had for a longer period than I could have wished-I wil not say experience more ample in extnnt than I could have wished-as to the working and the defects of our criminal laws without feeling that prevention is better than cure. (Hlear, hear.) One mournful reflection has always struck those with whom I bave had thegood fortuneto discuss thisimportantmatter, whether men professionally acquainted with the subject or men not profeesonaUy acquainted with it, except as rulers and administrators, or moralists and keen and acute observers of what is passing in society. No one is senseless enough to dream of dispendng with penal legislation; no one is so unreflecting and thoughtless as to believe it pOs sible that society ever could be knit together, or could exist in safety without a due administration of criminal law, temperate and tempered with mercy if you will, but still firmly and unrelentingly executed where guilt is clear, and where there is;no room for mercy. This is of absolute necessity, and aU that can be said on the subject is that it is our bounden duty to make our laws as good as possible, in order that they may be loved, and to administer those laws as firmly as possible, in order that they may be respected. Nevertheless, it is imposdble in discussing the effect of penal laws in deterring from crime not to be painfully sensible, as all the classes of persons to whom I have alluded have been, that those laws produce much less effect not only than might be desired, but even than could commonly be credited in the repression of offences. (Hear, hear.) The reason of this is obvious. I have heard my old and excellent friend MI r. Bentham repeatedly contend that if it were perfectly clear to a person who was about to commit an *,ffence-say a larceny-that he would within a short time be seized, tried, convicted, and punished, although the sentence should only condemn him to return what he had stolen, he would not, if ho were a man of sound mini, take the trouble to urdergo all that process, and would never attempt to appropriate his neighbour's possessions. I believe Mr. Bentham was perfectly right in contending that in such a case you would not require to threaten a man with the gallows, or transportation, or whipping; that the certainty I have mentioned would have the effect of prevent. ing men from theft. But the misfortune is that this assumes too much. It assumes that the man wiUl be caught (a laugh); that, if caught, he will be tried is likely enough, and thathe will be convicted if theevidenceproves himguiltv, to the satisfaction of our worthy friend the Recorder and the jury. All this is more or less, although not quite certain. But it is by no means certain that he will be dejected;; it is by no moans certain that being pursued he will be captured, and then, with all respect to my excellent and learned friend, it is by no means certain that he will be ab e so to try the case ana to instruct the jury as to make oonviction certain. N'ow, all the chances which a man has of escape naturally affect his mind when he is meditating whether he shall commit an offence or not. The man who is desirous of appropriating his neighbour's goods for purposes of his own is so sanguine that he magnifies all the chances of escape, thinks lightly of the posilbility of cap. ture, trial, and conviction, an finally makes up his mind that he will run the risk and commits the theft. What Mr. Bentham always left too much out of sight is, that when a man is minded to commit an offence he is not In such a calm state of mind as to be able to tako an accurate view of his position and the prospect of detectLon and punishment. All this points to the great object as to the desirability of which there can be no doubt,namely, to reform, if possible, the offender and t 'prevent the desire of committing an offence by inculcatitng in his mind prudential as well as honest motives. For I would not trust to one of theso motives only. I would give the greatest possible weight to good secular and religious educa. tion, as well as to sound moral training, but I would also attach gre-^t weight to prudential considerations-to that instruction which will teach a man how much better it will be for him, how much more comfortable for himself, how much happer a life he will lead if he is honest instead of pursuing taose vicious courses to which but too niany are prone. (Hear, hear.) We have within the last few days ad a great deal of discussion upon matters connected with reformatory disipline, but we have been oblged, from the variety of subjects, and happily from the number of able enlightened, and zealous individuals who have attended this congress, greatly to compress the papers and discussion. Now, I have frequently thought that we might go a little too far ilk the course of this compressive process. I well remember an elderly gentleman of my own profession -a judge-subo in the later portion of his days had taken to agricultural pursuits ; and as many men who take to pursuits without any great knowledge or long previous experience are very opt to become the prey of persons a little more ignorant than themselves, but A little more ingenious, so this worthy judge found a person who showed him;a kdinNdof manure,said to hOe of most admirable quality One >>1 "I", julge showed eths manure to an honest practical farmer, and sid, "I assure you it is of such wonderfal power that I wiU undertake from this snuffbox to produce sufficient to manure all that field of yours." ";Well , said the farmer, " that is very possible, my lord, and then I will undertake to put into the sarae snuffbox all the crop it will yield." (Laughter.) I bave certainly sometimes thought that as you may toolmuch compres3 your manure with a vicw to a good crop of corn, so also you may too much compress that which is to produce by discu.ssion in such an associatioa as ours fruits of a moral, intellectual, and I will add religious character. ATzd, therefore, when we next meet shall be strongly inclined to increase the number of days for onr sittings from four or five to six, Now we are here unon no controverted matter-there may be upon detaili some little difference of opinion, and I know some worthy friends of mine who have paid great attention to the subject have entertained doubts respecting certain provisions of my hon. friend's (Mr. Adderley) Billbut of t e absolute necessity of extending and perpetuating the reformatory system I believe there is no reasonable . question. It therefore gives me very great satisfaction to have been called upon by my right hon. friend, your president, to movethis first resolution, to which I now earnestly request you to give your attention, and I hope also your sanction. (Cheers):- " That this meeting is deepl, sensible of the value an t succs of the reformatory syitent. and would expresa it3 earnest hope that it may be yet more iarge!y and effletually applied to the metropota and the more densely peopled districti.' Mr. ADDERLEY said, the resolution was to the effect tha' reformatories, which had only existed three years in this country, had succeeded and ought to be further extendedNow, he could hardly conceive there could be one dissentient voice from this resolution in any part of the kingdom, still le8s in Birmingham, which from the first had been the fountain and the centre of the movement upon the subject. But though thsre nuight be a univergal isy3at ass re- garded the success o. these institutions and tkisipP,;tS,e of A6extending theirs, stil the -mme iatnent would not perhapi Prevail as to thte iprnaililei-on, which they rested and tbrived, upon which.,lone'Iegislatioa had recognized them, aLnd standing onwhieiL aione-w~eould hope for their steady and healthy increase. Therewesrtrwo features In the programnme of the Conference onx Social 'Science, one of which had given him the greatest pleasusre, and the otber of whiohi he as heartily condemned. Tzo first was the distinct separation in the sectionts of education and punishmient. The second, which he condemaned, was that the subject of reformatories had been referred to t'ne department of punishment instead cf that of educeation. Nowr, he humbly conceived that in the confusion of theme two ideas, which were most dis'tinct, of edncation andi of punishment, had arisen most of the difficulties which bad occurred in the way of legisilation on this subject. We had sometimes sought to punish by education, and at other times to educate by punishments, and such a confusioti was not maore false in theory than mischieviocs to this coutntry in practice. M~atty men of the highest eminence had hoped to meet the exigencies of punishment by educating the criminal. Now, hea was not onie of those who failed to appreciatethe necessity that none of our punishments should in any way tend to corrupt the persons puniished. It was most essetial that the punitive process should tend to reform, eud not to corrupt. At the same time, he believed that if the State undertook to reform its criminals altogether whenever they came under punitive treatment, the attempt would only end in failure and disappointment most detrimenta to the whole cause of morality throughout the country. The usual sub. jects of punishment were adults, and adults were generally beyond the process of education. If they were to be educated it was by raising the standard of society, and not by the artificial process of a prison schooL. On the other hand, until the establishmaent of reformantories within the last few years, the State laid holdl of children presented to it as outcasts driven into crime by parental negligence or training,. or (worse still) by compulsion, and these children, possessing no education, were treated by punishment suited only to adults. (Hear.) In these two proceases we punished childrenL who wanted education; we attempted to educate adults -who wantedl punishment. (EHear, hear.) Now, this error coulId not be considered as eradicated, when, even among the social doctors reformatories were considered in a section which had for its great subject that of secndary punishments. He conceivedathat the State, in introducing and recognizing reformatories, acknowledged that children before they were made amenable to punishment, should at lesst have the advantage of education; that theiy should have warning before the blow descended. Such a principle had only recently been recognized ; but it reFolved itself into the simple maxim that children neede-d training. Hero was the sum and substance of all the wisdom which all the conferences on reformato-iies throughout the ounntry could possibly arrive at-a maxima which every mother and nurs throughout the country had already got by heart. It was sometimes said "You may take this view, but the law has mnade of a reformatory a criminal institution-it places a restraint upon, and in point of fact hnrsnsteinae. Now, he maaintained that the law did no such thing as Impose for a single fault committed under every pssible exculpatory circumstanuce in early youth any such punishmnent. When the law said "1instead of three months' imprisonment we will send you for five or six ye-ars to a reformiatory," It did not mean to substituLte one penal process for another, hut instead of punishment to bestow upon the child the gift of education. (Hear.) The amount of restraint necessary in a reformatory, as in any public school, was no more, even if it amounted to so much, as the restrain imposedo an a pprentice bound to a master. These chilre we're not educated and had received no industria training; anad the State said, "It is important for them and us that they should have such traLining." It accordingly bound these children to schoolmasters and to industrial trades with this provision-that at the earliest possible opportunity they should be liberated even from such restraint as soon as ftting employment could be found for themn. (Hear, hea.)J Having reduced the principle of reformatories to th lost nursry role inst mentioned, he hoped his hearers would not allow its simplicity to deprive the subject of its interest In their minds. He entreated the chairman, as the first Minister of Education in England, not to repudiate the care of those schools which were not only withLin hs province, hut ouight to be his primary care. The right hen gentleman should bear in mind that the proper subject for his conisideration was the construction of a grand scemern of national educaton for this country. Now reformatories, he contended, formed a portion of our national schools. Hle would even go further, and say that the whole system of national education In England would have mainly to rest upon the experience of these, the lowest part of the structure, und that the experience acquxired from them woulId solve manv problems in the question. If he was not much mnistaken,' the whole system of national education, if ever successful here, would borrow more froma this system of reformatories than from any other class of schools throughout the country. In the first place reformatories had solved the great reigious problem. In the second place, whether for goodl or for evil, they had given us the first practica experiment of a rate-supported system of niational education. But, above all, they hrd dissipated for the first time the phantoms caused by fanciful theories thrown in the path of tho education of the poor by a refined and philosophic patronage. They had for the first time introduced a plain industrial system of edlucation for t - or;ad, if they succeeded in training those children hoonest industrial pursuLits adapted to their station in life, they would have, done more for the cause of education here than the national system even of a country like Prussia had ever proposed to itself as the climnax of its utmont possible success. lilcar, ha. It had been said, " Let us wait for a grand comprehensie system of national education." Now, he muaintained that if the great difficulty of national education was ever solvedl it would probably be in detail by measures such as this ; and he firmnly believed that while great men were placing themselves In a position to do hattle on this9 great difficulty, this kind of gueriUa warfare woold meet and disperse the enemy in detail, leaving those great men very much in the position of George IIL at the battle of Dettingen-in a posture of carte andI tierce while the enemy had disappeared. (A laugh.) Be demanded for reformatories that they should be introduced into the category of national schools throughout this country. (Hear, hear ) They were within that province, and did not belong to penal legislation. These institutions ought to be extended in three difierent ways-in number, especially in large towns; in size, hut, above all in the way of provision for children leaving reformatories and entering into life. There had been legislation enough in regard to the establishmenxt andl improvement of reformatories, but this last point,-eare that these children persevered in good, -which required no legislation, had not been carefully attended to. It was entirely the province of private benevolence, buxt it was a point more essentia than any other. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman concluded by seconding the resolution. Lord STAN,LEY. -I bad the honour last year of preiding over a conference which was held on this subject at Bristol -a meeting numerically essal in comparison with that of to-night, but still one, I hope, not entirely wnithout fruit. On that account, I suppose, Ihave been r'-neste to offer to you a few observations on the subject hich was then. and is nowv, under discussion. Having been so called upon, It naturally occurred to me to consider what remarks I could offer with any prospect of their being of service. I think, on the whole, we may see the rEformiatory movement has reached a stage at which it no longer needs the stimulus of public agita. tion. Inde,pendent of public opinion no man and no institution in this country is, and-t4hank God for it !-can be; hut the reformatory movement has been taken up by the Government, and it has formed the subject of sever al Acts of the Legislature. It has be.-ome, as it were, an institution of the c-ountry. The question is not now whether reformatories shad be established; it is not even -' how" they shall be establi-shed. The only nlestion which remains for us to consider is, what are the onecks, what are the conditions, what are the linutations within which the establishment of these schools can be of use? I thought, therefore, the best service I could do to-night would be, in half-a-dozen words, to try as it were to map out somezrocks on -which the founders and promoters of such instItutioEs are likely to strike. (Hear.) The first danger I think which such institutions incur is the risk of their exciting a fe-eling of envy in the minds of the honest poor. (Hear.) That Is a danger wrhich is perhapsnot sufraciently considered, and of which Iconfeas the magnitude seems ..o me to increase the more I consider the subject. Buzttif the danger is real the remedy i-s obvious. Do not set ups magnificent establishments. Do not make them show places. Let everything be as cheap and rough and aim peI as is consistent with decency and health, and, in reasonable limits, with the comfort of the inmates, (Hear.) Do not aim at any great intellectual attainLment on the part of the boys whom you tak-e In. (Hear.) Herd work, both asa moralandasa physical remedy, may best be applied in such a case Let youlr reformatory schools be open to adl who choose to see them, and if any labourer, or small farmer, or any man living honestly by the sweat of his brow chooses to look in, let him go hcme and be able to say, "IWell! thank God, my children have no occasion to envy these." (Cheers.) The next point I wculd note is, that proper care and discrimiination should be used in selecting the class of boys whom you send to these reformatory schools. I do not think, as a generai rle, unless there is something very, aggravated in the offence, anxd unless the habits of the bey aesuha to indlicate habitual crim I do yeoar suhin as onences, when of a trifling nature, ouglht to justify detention in a reformatory. I know that boys have frequently been sent for very slight offences, not by way of punish ment, but partly with the idea of inflicting a punishment on the parent, and much more with the idea of doing the boy himself a kindness by removing him from vicious associates and, probably, from vicious relatives. That is a weLl understood proceeding, and in some respects it. may be a successful one. I do not ventare to dispute its pTopriety, hut I do say that, draw what distinction you will hetween reformatory and penal treatment, still a certain degree of stigma will always attach to boys wbo have been placed under reformatory treatment. I do not say that fuch a stigma will be equal in degree to that which adheres to the lad who comes from a gaoL If it were, the utility of reformatory schools might indeed be doubted. The disgrace E nd reproach in future life are far less, but still to a certain e xtent it is a cause of reproach. I confess I have read with l ain paragraphs in the reports of more than one reformatory school in which it has been said of this or that boy," WVe have discharged him from the school, but we have no right to take credit for his reformation, for the fact is, he did not require reformation-he was a boy tempted into one solitary crime, but be was in no degree criminal ." (Hear, hear.) The next word of caution I would offer woluld be to suggest the propriety of a greater degree of classification according to age than as yet, from the comparative paucity of schools, it has been possible to adopt in these establishments. At some of these in. ".utions you will have almost men detained. It may be and is quite right that they shonld be so detained, but the same kind of treatment which is suitable for them is not the fittest ft,r children of 10 or 11 years of age. (Hear.) There are necessarily different kinds of treatment, and these can, I believe, be better carried out in separate schools than in establishments where boys of widely different ages are united. The last point I would touch upon is one to which I think we shAll be found more frequently adverting some two or tbree years hence than we have had occasion to do hitherto. I maean what has been called the outlet queiolor - the (lues- tion of what you are to do with koys when the time oomes for their quitting tbe reformatory. (Hear, hear.) You are all aware (although I do not mean to draw a precise parallel between the two clasees) that in dealing with adult criminals the mere detention is compara'tively a simple matter; the difficulty arises when the period of detention has expired and you have to turn them loose upon society. Now, I do not think anything like an equal amount of difficulty will arise as to boys zent to reformatory schools; but at the same time I muet remind you that a judicious diswpea of them when released may make the whole difference between undoing your whole work by a few weeks of temptation and a continued adherence to the good habits taught in the sehools. (Hear, hear.) I do not think a universal rule caa be laid down for all classes of boys. We all knowthere is a wide distinction of character between a boy brought up in agricultural districts and one who from his earllest infancy has belonged to the criminal classes of a great town. In the former cass you may send him, perhaps, to the neighbourhood from which he came,-he may have been onoe led aray by bad companlons,-but if employment can be procured for him, and if by a course of good conduct he becomes restored to his own self-respect end the respect of society, you need not fear a relapse into crtme on hi prt. But I doubt that in the case of a town-bred lad, who has been brought up in crime, to whom the profession of crime has been fanmiliar from infancy, who perhaps throughout the period of his detention has retained a lurking taste for it, remembering the adventure, the excitement, the risks, and the indulgenoes whioh a quieter nd more honest course of life is not likely to afford him. (Hear, hear.) I believe you will fnd many boys who, although honestly disposed, are possessed of a love of excitement and adventure which requires in some way to he gratified, and if you send those boys back to labour, whether in town or country, there wlli be great risk of a return to their old haunts and a relapse into their old habit For lads of this description (and they are numerous) there are two outlets. I do not speak of the army or navy, for there are great and obvious objections to them; but I allude to emigration to the coloniea, and the mercantile marine. I mention the colonies with a practical aim,because there are in this country many persona who have connexions, friends, or correspondents abroad, and if there be any such person who cannot contribute largely in pecuniary means to the cause, but is disposed to aid It in other ways, I know of no mode in which he can do so with more effect and with less trouble to the giver than by obtaining, through the medium of his friends in the colonies, employment for one, two, or more lads in some remote colonial settlement. (Hear, hear.) I am told, anad have taken some pains to gather the facts, that of the boys sent forth from reformatory schools the percentage of those who, having emigrated, have as colonists done weUl is far greater than the rcentage of those who have similarly done well at home. 'with regard to training for a life at sea, I need only refer to the experience of the Akbar Reformatory Ship at LiverpooL I am told there is no difficulty in procuring employment at sea for the boys from that institution, the disadvantages of their previous character being more than balanced by the excellence of the training they bave receivedon board that ship. (Hear.) I cannot take credit to myself for having been one of the first to support this movement; that credit belongs to Mr. Acdderley, to the Rev. Sidney Turner, to L. de Metz, and, not least, to your Recorder; but this I must say, that I have watched this question closely and earnestly from its days of unpopularityalmost of ridicule. I shall continue to watch it through the very different, but perhaps not leas really perilous period of unlimited popularity. (Hear.) With these vwords only I end as I begun :-Take care, one and all of you who are interested in this movement, take care that while exerting yourselves honourably, benevolently, aud wisely for the reformation of the criminal population you do not lay yourselves open even to the unfounded charge of seeming to neglect or give cause for envy to those who, exposed to many temptations, have laboured and continue to labour for the honest support of themselves and their families. (Loud cheers.) The resolution was carried unanimously. Sir J. PAKINGTON congratulated the meeting on the assemblage of that vast number of the citizens of Birminghaua who, after several days of able and exciting proceedings, had come together animnated by generous interest in a question which did not concern any selfish objects of their own, but related mainly and essentially to the welfare of the destitute masses. The resolution he had to move ws: "That, conBidering the prevueon of crime to be the moat m. portant of all the objects which the reformatory system haa in view. this meeting cordiauy rejoices In the pasdng of theo Industrial Bchools Act of last meson, and trust, that its provisions may be extensively applied" He always felt pleasure In doing anything in his humblo power to promote this most important iand he was happy to say'most successful movement; but never had he spoken upon the subject with such pleasure as on the present occasion, because he could not help feeling that when be had before stood upon that platform to address them on this interesting question his object had bean to exhort, while he now had to congratulate. He had not forgotten-and he was sure those whom he was addressing had not forgotten-those two interesting conferences which took place in Birmingham a few years ago, and from which he believed he might with perfect accuracy date the commencement of the reformatory movement. From that moment public feeling was excited, and the public mind sanctioned and confirmed the principle that in policy, as in benevolence, to impose upon the infant criminal tho same punishment which was inflicted upon the adult criminal was a monstrous, an unjust, and an unsuccessful course, and that their duty was to endeavour in time to rescue this unfortunate portion of their feUow-subjects. The public mind at once adopted and sanctioned that idea. The action of Parliament followed public approbation, and they had heard from Lord Stanley and Mr. Adderley that so far as legislation was concerned there was nothing now to wish for on this subject. That was a matter of just congratulation to every man who had the welfare of his country at heart, and especiaUy to those he was then addressing, who had not only originated the movement, but had carried it on with a real, an energy, and a success which had distinguished Birmingham more perhaps than any other town. They wanted, then, no further assistance from Parliament. All they wanted was that the suppl7 of reformatories should be rendered more equal than it now was to the demand. He hoped that by indlvidual benevolence that object would be effected, and then, whatever might be the manure they used, the crop wonld be larger than that of which Lord Brougham had spoken. (A lang.) The reformatory movement, in the sense in which it was hitherto used, referred only to one limited class of boys who required our care-to those only who were brought within the grasp of the law. But there was another and larger class of neglected, unfortunate children who had not yet actuaily transgressed the law, and who were aptly caUed by Miss Carpenter "the perishing and the dangerous clases." It had been felt that, having provided by law for actual criminals, those to whom he had alluded ought not to be neglected. The subject was therefore taken up In the House of Commons by Sir Stafford Northcote, and after him by Mr. Adderley, through whose exertions the Industrial Schools Bill of last session was passed; and It Is now possIble to establish institutions for the reception of these unhappy children under the title of industrial schools, where they would be dealt with upon the same sound and benevolent principles as had been previously extended to actual criminals. Hitherto Parliament had not provided the means of founding these schools, aud he feared that at present there were not many in existenoe, bu' no doubt the benevolence of this country would shortly establish others, which would contribute most materially to aid the great cause in haud. He did not know whether ragged schools might be properly considered as connected with the educational or the reformatory movement, but he was quite sure they produced the most admirable results and were entitled to the most cordial support. He hoped that what Miss Carpenter urged would not be urged in vain, and that the Minister of Education would induce the Government to retraceotheir steps and to give some support to ragged schools. (Hear, hear.) At this moment he would not detain them by dwelling on the connexion between ignorance and crime, or how best to apportion punishment. The onases of crime were various, but perhaps It was mainly referable to that infirmity of human nature which was common to us alL We must aU feel that our course in life depended materrtally on the circumstances in which we were placed and upon the influences and the temptations to which we were subjected. Both educated and uneducated, rich and poor, high or low-born, must have felt the power of and have been exposed to the perils of temptation. We could not hope, then, to eradicate crime, but we might diminish the number of those from whom we drew not our greatest, but our habitual criminals. By such agencies as had been adverted to that night much might be effected in this direction, and tbey would bave the consolation of feeling that in doing so they were producing the greatest benefit to their common country, and were rescuing many a hapless fellow-creature from a course of misery and vice, enabling him to live a life of industry and happiness. (Cheers.) The Hon. and Bev. G. YORKE seconded the resolution. The llev. SYDNy TuitNER, in supporting the resolution, took the opportunity to state what had been done for the extensIon of the reformatory system during the year, Eight new reformatories had been certified, two in Scotland and six In England; and four more were about to be certifiod; so that by the end of the year we should have about 60 schools inaction, holding 2,000 children. Eight of these were for girls, who, however, formed only one-tenth of the number of juvenile offenders to be provlded for. Five of the reformatories, holding 500 inmates, were for Catholic chil- lyren. 2ie was glad to say that the reformatories had considerably advanced in internal managementand regulation. There was leas indulgence and more discipline, though not less kindness. He had successfully carried out the law which fixed on parents the responsibility of their children's maintenanoe while detained in these reformatories. In the first instance he had dealt with London and Liverpool, and he was glad to say that there was scarcely a parent in either of these places who had a child in a reformatory that had not been called upon to contributefor that child's support. (Hear.) In aboutthree-fifths of the cases investigated payments varying from 6d. to 4s. per week had been obtained, and the amount for the last quarter was nearly 901. Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham itself, and other towns were or soon would be under the sanie process. He considered this as an essential safeguard to the reformatory movement. (Hear, bear.) If the parent were allowed to escape the obligation which the law of God and the just rights of society equally imposed upon him, and to make the honest and careful support the child he had neglected or perverted, there could be no blessing from God, no lasting benefit to society in the movement. (Hear, hear,) The }solution was carried by a forest of hands. hIr. X, HANDURY, hI.P,, proposed the following resotin tion: "That this meeting would express its strong conviction that t'io clalms of religion and the reqiuirements of social policy equally demand that the reformation of offenders, of whatewr age, bo distinctly aimed at, and the means and opportunity of retuming to paths ot bonesty i and virtue be afforded them." This motion was seconded, and carried likle the rest. I Lord J. RUSSELL, who was enthusiasticaly received, E said he did not wish to intrude for any long tine upon the meeting, and he had not thought himself at all worthy of taking part in the proceedings, which had particular reference to reformatory and industrial schools, because there were many gentleimaen present who had taken a most active pirt in establishing those institutions, and wbo better uesersed to be heard upo a subject with awich they were so intltfmtel acquainted. A6 ha howo ever, to propose that tbe thanks of the meetg be given to Mr. Cow" t for the able and sarnet maner in M hich he had presitted. It afforded him great pleaure to propose this resolution He was glad to see the important; office of Vice. President of the Council of Bducation flled' by one who took so great an interest iu the subject, and het was sure that if his right hon. friend would, as he was now attending to reformatories and industrial schools, attend likewise to our day schools, and would make himself muster of the present state of education in this couatry, the most beneficial rtsults might be expected to follow. It Wa very desirable that there should be Borne person responsible for the conduct of the department of education, to whom all> complaints could be addressed,and before whorn all information connected with the subject might be placed. He be- lieved his right hon. friend was well qualified to condensethat information, and to bring before the House of Commons from time to time such measures as were deemed requidte; and they might expectthat greatimprovementsvvoul be made within the next few years with regard both to reforniatories and industrial schoolL He might add-althonjh it wLas not immediately connected with the xubject of Te meeting-that he had always been anxious to ee the people well quAlified by their education and attainments to exercite olitical franchises, being convinced thas if th ever the Legislature might do, they would i the people fully justifying the trust reposed Ln them. (Loud cheers.) The MAYORt seconded the resolution, which was care,ied unanimously, and the vast assemblage dispersd.
