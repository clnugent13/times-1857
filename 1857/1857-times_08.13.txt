NEW NOVBLS.* From the innumerable novels which annually invade our English literature as the swallows pervade our English summer, to catch at folly as it flies, we select two, which are remarkable not only for the exhibition of much power, but also for the utter absence of pretension. It is the vice of an immense number of fictions that they awe novels only in fown; in spirit they are sermons, they are' political pamphlets, they are philosophical inquiries, they are books of elegant extracts, they are guides to French conversation, they are complete letter-writers-anything but novels. They are abominably useful, frightfully exalted in sentiment, insultingly instructive. People have talked so much about the wickedness of shams, and about the neceseity of earnestness, that now we have come to the greatest sham of all, which gives us philosophy in sport, and renders our amusements a most serious business. Dining will one of these days become a formulated science, and dancing has long had all the solemnity of a religious ceremonial. These intensely earnest people pursue pleasure not from any excess of animal spirits, but as a lugubrious Merryandrew tumbles at a fair. Hence those curious allegorical novels in which the heroes have a strange resemblance to that insane puppy, Wilhelm Meister, who went about the world clasping women's waists, under the pretence of panting for the eternal, grasping the ideal, and serving an apprenticeship to some German mystification; and those weary analyses on the model of Contarini Jileming, a Psychological Romance, in which is traced the progress of a mind from nothing to its last result in nothingness. Or, if the novelists do not trespass beyond the pale of fiction, and profess to be something better than novelists, how- often are-we met with pretences of a different kind-one man, in fancied imitation of Dickens, overpowering us with geniality; another, in foolish aping of Thackeray, indulging in tremendous cynicism; a third, after the manner of Harry Lorrequer, rejoicing in frolics that are simply ferocious ? Who that glances over these publications does not long for a little common sense and good feeling, for amnsement without the intrusion of theories, and for excitement without F the ostentation of superior wisdom? Whatever be thepositivemerits of the novels which we are aboat to introduce to our readers, they have this negative one, that they are what they profess to be-they are stories of modern life, told without any attempt at fine writing, without any striving after climaxes and points, and without any design of alluring the reader by some flowery path to the precipice ot some terrible theory, or into the platitudes of some vulgar moral. It is a pleasure to meet with storyteUers who write because they have something to say and because they are anxious to tell it, who take our ordinarj English life such as they find it, and pour out pleasant gossip abounding in incident and not in mere dialogue. Among the many disadvantages of railways and advancing civilization there is one which some 2:) years ag,o the 'critics were fond of predicting a, inevitable--the extinction of comedy, whether in the novel or dramatic form. The theory was this,that comedy depends very much for its material on the differences of local colour, habits, and manners. A Yorkshireman placed on the stage is inherently a funny fellow, so in a native of " vamous Zoomer7etsheer." But the effect of railways is to destroy distance and to efface local characteristics, while thie tendency of civilization generally is to prevent individuality and to render every member of society as like his neighbour as possible. Bot to abolish all superficial distinction of ntanners is to refuse to comic writers thestrawswithoutwhichit is impossible for them to make bricks; and argal, railways are not only inimical to poetry, they are still more inimical to comedy. The novels before us, like so many others of the same kind, are curious refutations of that theory. Our railway system is perfected, and the novel of light comedy finds no lack of materials. Scotch novels and Irish novels, it is true, are out of date; the writers do not often attempt to make mirth out of provincial distinction of dialect and manner. It has been found that in the collision of classes3 there is a much richer and at the same tima more legitimate source of comedy than in the comparison of local pPculiarities and national modes. It is easy to contrast a Frenchman with an Englishman, in proportion to the difficulty df -binaging ot~ tha subtle shiades of contra?a that eeparate ant aristocrat by birth from an aristocrat by fortune. In Mr. Trollope's novelwe are preeented with a most amusing picture of clerical life in a eathedral town,-a life that is as distinct from our ordinary existence as the life of a striet Jewis in the midst of our London riot. So every profession, every rank, has its singularities, and Mrd. Gore has illustrated in her latest production the truth which in one of her previous novels she pro pounded with much epigrammatie force. "There is no mistaking an official man. All trades and professions have their slang and charlatanism; and that of aPrivyCouncillor, though of ahighertone, is a no less inveterate jargon than that of a horsedealer. Long practice had rendered this technical dialect a mother tongue to Mr. Hamilton. His arguments abounded in Ministerial mysticism; his jokes were Parliamentary; his notes of invitation formal as official documents. His anecdotes were authenticated by dates; he spoke as if before a committee, or under the influence of the whipper-in. He scarcely knew how to leave a room without the ceremony of pairing off, or to hazard an opinion, lest he should be required to justify it to his party." This (quoted from The Hamiltomn) is admirably said, and is at once a fair specimen of M-rs. Gore's peculiar style, and a forciblq description of the kind of material upon which she works. Her new novel, The Two Aristocracies, is a brilliant picture, in which the lords of trade are com- ared with the lords of land, in which the good and bad qualities are brought out, and it is shown that human life is the same under whatever different aspects. It is one of Mrs. Gore's favourite theories that happiness is very nearly equalized in every sation of life; that the greater the joy the greater, also, is the susceptibility of sorrow; while, on the other hand, moderate pleasure is succeeded by moderate pain. The miseries of fashionable life, it is true, are different from the miseries of business life, but practically the result is the same. Marriage is the grand topic of every novelist, and there is no subject on which Mfrs. Gore is more fond of dilating than on the wretchedness of young wives whose husbands allow them every indulgence except that of an utterly domestic life. In fashionable society the particular phase of the misery which the authoress takes a pleasure in depicting is the position of those unfortunates who marry younger sons of the nobility, and must be content with a suite of apartments in the town mansions of their fathers-in-law, the husbands making up for the want of establishments of their own by using all the more the conveniences of a club; while in that society which ha; wealth, but not fashion to recommend it, the torture takes the form of an incongruous marriage, in which the bride learns to despise her husband and to laugh at his relations. The aristocracy of birth thws seeking an alliance with new wealth, and the aristocracy of trade seeking an alliance with Nlorman blood, the result is nearly alike in both cases, conducing to splendour without comfort, and to merrymaking without content. In the illustration of this, idea it would be difficult for Gore to excel Cecil and The HamUaions i urlliancy of execution and interest of story, but with that fertility which never degenerates and that energy which never flags she has in 17te Two Aristocracies produced a tale worthv of a place beside the best of her previous productions. It contains the history of a Birmingham manufacturer working his way in the world to affluene -and distinction-for a moment on the brink of ruinthrough the embeizlement of a truisted servant, finally triumphant over misfortune and enabled to form alliances- on equal terms with the best in the land. In this connexion we have a description of the relations of the msnufacturing towns to the landed gentry, which is worth quoting ea a picture of the past:- ' In almost an counties whose blue skies are blured by the chimneys of factories and forges, and whose mother. earth is corrupted by the soorime of fraoes, there exists a permanent feud betweena the landed gentry and the huge monster called Trade, which heaves, belows, and vomits £re in the midst of them, as, of old, the dragon of Wamt. ley; not deigning to remember that whereas the dragon exterminated by More of More-hall devoured houses and steeples, the modern monster creates them, swallowing only the proiiuce of their dirty aerea,-acepting tn.eir lean hine as beef, ~nA their rancid sheep as 8onthdown.u And though the consumption of amanufactulring town doubles thevalue of his estate, the accent Of a Warwokalhire squire in enun. ciating the name of Birmingham (he does not call it ' Brm. nmagem,' lest the familiar word shoula be interpreted into - IhM .T-wo Arijtoc&aies A NoveL By Mms.

Its millions might dnd their way into the public coffers - its hundreds of thousands of living souls were, like Violsa history-' a blankl,iny lord 1' " The byeword ' Brummagem' was reserved to typify to ears polite everything that wa vulgar or oounterfeit ; whilthat of 'flue' conveyed, in Derbyshire or Lancashire, all the scorn included in the edigma of ' clod,' as applied by the exclusives of club windows in St. James's-street, to some great landowner, the Parlbimentary representative of a wilderness of clay- or mod. A still more lively nketch than the foregoino, is the accouitt of the two old sisters, Lady Lucy and Lady. Leonora Bellasis, who are introduced remonstrating with their nephew, Lord Arden, on account of the too great intimacyof his wife and daughter with Italian musiciaus:- " These twin sisters-so alike in grimness of feature and spareness of form that, 'in their cold youth, when George LL was King,' no man had ventured to propose to either, lest he sbould seem to coamit a species of. bigamy-con. sidered all familiar coutact with 'people who were paid by the hour to be entertainieg' as degrading and injurious. "Lady Lucy-and her twin sister was but her echowas one of whom it might be said, as of Sir Philip Sidney by Sir Henry Wotton, that 'her wit was the mneasure of congruity,' and the informality and slang of modern life almost reconciled her to the fact that her threescore years and eighteen were wearing to an end. ' ' s is scarcely decorous, my dear nephew-scarcely decorous,' said she, searchingly regarding Lord Arden over her spectacles, and settling her towy front,- Ithat a young lady of sixteen, like moy grand niece Lady Althe. Littlecote, should be on terms of friendship with foreign fiddlers ana squallers-(is it, Leonora?) We are told that your daughter is a first-rate mnsiicLan. I had rather she didn't know one note from another than forget what is due t'i soelety from a family like ours. (Wouldn't we, Leonora ) Some day, when she elopes with an Italian fellow whos, face looks like a horsehair sofa with the stuffing working out, and who has twenty vowels in his name and not a crown-piece in his pock-et. you'll look very blue, my dear Arden,-you'll look very blue-(won't he, Leonora t)' "Lady Leonora, who for the last threesre years had been acting as a living affirmative to her sister, like the I Yea, for.soth,' which forms half the responses of King Edward VI.'s Catechism, nodded assent. 'I ery blue, my dear Luey,-ceigly blue.' 'It was wen enough for your step-sister, my de%, nephew,' resumed her ladyship, clearing her throat, ' for I'm told that her mother was the daughter of a country parson. But in my poor sister Cath'rine's timne, when things were manaed in a very different style at Arden.-hall, -*y, in a veery dinerent manner- (weren't they, Leonora? ) " ' xceedingly different,' murmured Yea forsooth. -' Every teair, ov4ry season, about March (if no influerLsa waE ptevnigi(e Sir Arseott and Lady Cath'rine gave a grpmd how6ert. in Bruton-street; with Mara one year, Bilhington ahotle*, rEini k'third,-always the singer in vogue2-ai*hy8 the'singe'r iWv6g&fe-'(wasu'tthere, Leonora?)

" 'Exactly as if in quarantine ' "'teither my sister Cash'rine nor Sir Arsoott, thank goodness, had the smallest taste for music,' resumed Lady Lucy. 'It is not from them your daughter inherits her crorchets and quavers. But as Handel and Arno were favourite composers at Windsor and Frogmore, my sist, r a ways gave us at her concerts Handel and Airne. None of th',me indecent die-away Italian Notturni, which Lady A thea and ber musical governess pipe up together. Protty sort of tbings they muns be,-written expressly to be sung in the night time ! tnd sure and certin I am, my dear Arden, that if my sister Ctb'riue could put her head out of tbe grave, and see the only daughter of her only son rigmaroling Italian lovesoungs in company ivth professors and opera singers, she'd dr&w it back again with ho"rrr and indignation-yes, draw it back- aain with horror and indignation-(wouldn't she Leonora ?' ' Leonor* of course assented, nor did her nephew di.sent; for he thorouzhily appreciated the respectable sentimeats and respectable worldly position of bis spinster aunts. But to undertake, as they desired, the reformation of the habits of his houas, was out of the question. Reprisals on the, part of Lady Arden might cost him dear. He had engaged to leave in her handsrthercontrol of his daughters education, and hiust not be the first to attempt a breach of compact. Better that Lady Lucy and her echo should ve)l their august old faces in a thunder-cloud than provoke reprisals. "' But from the earliest times he could remember, when r either his head nor his mind were utterly bald-wben h- v, a no sceptic, no trimmer-he had reverenced those two staoly maidens as types of the eighteenth century aristocracy-hucikram covered with tiffany-Dr. Johnson gar. sished with Debrett, living the life, if not of the just, of the correct; and wept over, after deatb, by marble eeruhim, des ened by Bacon. In his Nouth they were not young. Now, 7 t the close of nearlyb alfa entury, they appeared to him semp ternal; and it was like provokinu the Destinies themselves to raise a frown on their parcenent brows. Lord Arden knew how proud they were of him, and that their spectacles were never rubbed so clear as to peruse the speeches of the sole nephew of their house and heart. It would break those aged hearts, which, like the Sevres teacups in their cabinets, had survived so many casualties, if his wife, in some moment of exaseration caused by h:s breach of agreement with her, should acquaint them that the nephew of whose political standing and high morality they were so road, had an illegitimate son about to be entered at Oxford, and kept a second family carriage for a wife in all but name, living in a state of prolligacy so respectably organized as to make it trebly offensive. ' In their time such things were done in mysterious obscurity, and named in a whisper, with uplifted hands and eAes. A son of Lord Ardenas bearing his name, yet unentrted to the prefix of * honourable,' would have sufficed to efface his own from the heart and will of LAdy Lucy Bellasia I "( * Wouldn't it, Leonora T')" Mlr. Trollope has found a less hackneyed theme in the lights and shadows of clerical life. In general it is bad policy for a novelist to confine his attention lo a single profession; his art becomes a trick his characters become monotonou;s, the whole book savours of the shop. Nautical novelsare almost the only endurable exception, and it must be remembered that a great part of the amusement which they afford arisst from the fact that they are not entirely nautical, but dilate very largely on the contrast between the sailor and the landsman. When the clergy have been introduced into novels they have generally been quite subordinate characters, aud rendered either ridiculous or utterly insipid. The usual plan, indeed, is to introduce a couple of clergymen as clown and pantaloon, the one a young Levite remarkable for his bigotry, for his meddling, for his vulgarity, the other an aged brother so correct himself that these is not one salient feature in his character, and so benign that it is impoesible for him to make other men equally correct. In the present novel, which, although complete in itself, is a continuation of a previous fiction, entitled The Wasden, there is scarcely an individual who is not either a parson or a passon's wife; all the ideas are ecclesiastical, the dresses are canonical, and the conversations have a rubrical tinge. Yet the subject is so frersh and the representation so vivid, that the contracted limits of the story are forgotten, and we are left to wonder that more has not long ago been made of such promnising materials. The story itself is a mere nothing. The Bishop of Barcnester dies, and a successor is appointed in the person of Dr. Proudie; the dean also dies shortly afterwards, and the question is who shall be the new dean. The new bishop is a mild Whig, with very moderate opinions, who would work well with almost any man, but unfortunately he is not his own master, and has not a word to say in the regulation of his own diocess. Ho is governed by his wife; his wife is governed by the bishop's chaplain, Mr. Slope, avery Low0hurchman; atid-Mr. Slope is governedbyhis ambition. Through,the interference of these good people arise all the complication of the story and all the developments of ciaracter. Perhaps the scenes between the bishop and Mr. Proudie are a littleoverdrawn, but, althoughhighlycolourea, they are not the less amusing delineations of human misery, as experienced by a man who permits himself not only to be henpecked in his private relations! but also to be in his public capacity under fvmaie domination. The poor bishop is not only asaailed by his wife in the privacy"M his dressingroom, he cannot receive visitor #Othout her permission, When he is asked a quostion sho replies for him; he cannot make an a tpointalent in his diocess without her consent, and A is s Iearful act of rebellion whten he goes to. Isit the Arehbishop of Canterbury unaccompanied by her.. Mr. Slope is a stiLl greater tyrant; And so exerdises his authority that he' not only: arouses the 6ppo- sition of the whole cbapterhomie, but ultlrately' prov6kee thoe jealousy of Mrs1 Prondie, wlid drives him from the diocess in disgae, after he has made rihitlou o h evrybody by his daring attempts to perpetrate a wegihymaug.

"'I h! Eleanor,' he continued-and it seemed to be his idea that as he had once foaud courage enough to pronounce her Christian name he oould not utter it often enough' Ah I Eleanor will it not be sweet, vwith the Lord's assa. tance, to travel hand iu hand through this mortal valley, wlch His mercies will make pleasnt to us, till hereafter - we shlU dweeU together at the loot of HLis throne ' And then a more tenderly pious glance than ever beaned from the lover's eyes. '.Alr Eleanor -' "'ty name, Mr. Slope, is Mrs. Bold,' said Eleanor, who, though determined to he_r out the tale of his loie, was too much disgusted by his blasphemy to be able to besi much. moreof It. 'Sweetest angel, be not so cold l' said he, *nd as he said it the chaumpagne broke forth, and ho contrivedto pass his arm round her waist. He did this wish considerable clevernees, for up to this point Eleanor had contrived lwith tulerable success to keep her distance from him. They had got into a walk nearly enveloped by shrubs, and Mr. Slope therefore, no doubt, considered that as they were now alone it was fitting that he should give her some outward demonstration of that affection of which he talked so rmuch. It ms, erhaps be presumed that the same stamp of measures h*A n found to succeed with Olivia Proudie. Be this as It may, it was not successful with Eleanor Bold. ' She sprang from hin as she would have jumped from an add*, but she did not spring far-not, indeed, beyond arm's lehgth; said then, quick as thought, she raised her little hand and dealt him a box on the ear with such right good will theA it sounded among the trees like a miniature thunder-clap." As Mrs. Proudie and Mfr. Slope furnish the comedy of the novel, Dr. Grantley, the Archdeacon, and his friends firlrnsh the clerical ideal, good sober people, well-educated, moderate in opinion, and rxceedingly correctin all social observances. Fortuno favours them in the end; Mrs. Proudie is resisted, Ms, Slope.A discomfited, a brother-in-law of the Archdeacon's s appointed dean, and iafter a few months off.turmoil the sedate opinions and timehonoured usages-that prevailed in the days of the old bishop regain their influence under the benignant sway bf tbev isew one. The whole life thus revealel is curious-and intrer,ting, m- spite of a tediousness of explanation whfich seems kt be natural to theoauthor as well as to his theme; and it mnay be regarded as not unreal, in spite of a tendeucy to caricature which MIr. Trollop coninuaf displays, and especially when he has to dealwith au1S jects out of the clerical sphere. The repmarks -wi in this veinhe hasmadeontheinfluenceexertedbyt418 conductors of the nowspaper press on public.«p pointments are too insignificat to be sermusly criticized; yet, as this is the socond clerical 40veI published within a very short period (the oter is the Permersion of the Raev.

KEAY'S DIVORCE BILL This Bill was read a second time. NEW MEMBER. Captain HAnTOX took the oaths and his seat on his election for the Fallirk Burghs. He was accompanied to the table by lord Duncan and Mr. Buchanan. SMOKE NISANCCE (SCOTLAND) ABATEMENT BILL. On the order of the day being read for the consideration of this Bill, as amended, Mr. BUCHANAN complained that the Bill, which had emanted in the House of Lords, had taken almoat the whole of the manufacturing intrestau in Scotland, which it seiously affected, by surprise. The large mialeable iron and, earthenware manufacturers espec y reat reason'ts complain, iniasmuch as no opportunity ha been afforded them of stating to the House, through the usual channels, the oppressive manner in which the Bill would operate against them. The result would be that they would be brought under the general operation of one clause ia the Bill, which would be exceedingly injurious to their interests. Re read 'letters to the House from some of those manufaoturers In support of that statement. Besides, he contended, the exceptions made in the Bill to Its operation were so large that its whole value would be absolutely lost. For example, by reason of those exceptions, the Bill would not tend to uify the atmogphere o the upper valley of the Clyde from he contaminations produced by the numerous manufactories which bordered upon it. For any praotical purpose indeed, the Bill would be a mere nullity, inaemuch as the great transgressors wrould go free, and by the operation of that sweeping exceptional clause all the smaller ones would be excused. Besides, in different parts of the country, as in E1dinburgh and Glasgow, where it waas more especially important to suppress the smoke nuisance, the Bill Zwould go to supersede local Acts passed with that view. but the principal objection he took to the Bill was that it had been brought in by private parties. He submitted that a Bill to regulate the police of the country ought not to be in such hands. A select committee should have been appointed to take the whole subject into consideration, and to ascertain in what degree such a Bill was likely to affect the manufacturing interests of the countr. For those resons he would move as an amendment that the Bill as amended be considered that day three months. Mr. KINNAIRD said he was surprised at the course taken by his hon. friend the member for Glasgow. The Bill had been some months before the country, and yet his hon, friend had said that it had come upon the House with auinrse. Again, his hon. friend said the Bill was of such a strigent nature that it would be impossible for anbody to conduct manufactores, and then, in the next breath he said it would be wholly inoperative owing to the ooncessions which Its promoters had made for securing unanimity, He left his hon. friend to reconcile those statements as beat he could. The amendment of Mr. Buchanan was put and negativad without a division. Mr. BUCHANA N7 moved to subbtitute a claue for clauses S and 7, the object of which was to give a party dissatisfied ith any decree of the sheriff or magistrates under the Bill anrght of appeal to the Lord Ordinary, 1¢ After a few wiords from Mr. Km'Ae.&n the clause was negatived. Mr. BUCHANAN proposed, as an amendment, thst in clause one the words "a quarter of a-mile" should be left, out, and the words, " 200 yards," inserted. MIr. KIN AIRD opposed the amendment. The committee divided, when the numbers were,- For the amendment .. ... ... .. S Against I. ... ... 57 Majority .. ... ... Mr. BUCHANAN proposed that clause A whioh gave the power of assesement, should be omitted. Lord DUNCAN also strongly opposed the clause. The LORD ADVOCATE defended the clause. The committee dividod, when the numbers were,- For the clause_ ... .. ... ... 32 Agains it ... ... ... ... 27 Majority ... ... ... ... -5 The other clauses were considered, and the Bil ordered to be read a third time to-morrovr. SALE OF OBSCENiE PUBLICATIONS, &c., PRBEVEN- TION BILL. The louse 'went into committee on this Bill, and the clauses were agreed to. Sir E. PERRY moved, on the part of the Lord Advocatc, that the Bill do not extend to Scotland. Mr. ROEBUCK aid the hon. member for the Tower Hamlets had araendments which he meant to propose, but the Bill had rushed through committee, and he presumed i- was not for the present competent to move that they should be introduced. Meanwhile the Scotch members objected to the Bill applying to Scotland, and he thought they were right, for a more preposterous Bill had never been brought before that House. It w s an attempt to make people virtuous by Act of Parliament, but it could never succeed. A man who had a teete for the class of prints and publications referred to in the BMil would get them in spite of ali the laws they could pass They would, therefore, not prevent mischief being done, whie there was great danger of making mischief by an undue interference with the affairs of private life, and by encouragin an abuse of power Suppose a country magistrate had a feeling of enmity against a poacher whom he could not reach as such. The poacher might, however, sell books, and some one came forward to complain that he had got obscene publications in his house. A warrant could be issued to search his house, and in the course of the search poaching materials might be found. The magistrate would thus gain his object, which otherwise he could not have done. IA London, perhaps, this cocldnot be done, for there the magistrate acted in the eye of the public, and with a police reporter in his court; but in the country there would be no such check, the proceedings taking ace, it might be, in the magistrate's private parlour. (Hear.) Vrobjected to any measure that would in reality create an inquisition and operate despotically towards the people. (Hear, hear.) Such consequences might flow from this Bill, and therefore he objected to it as it now stood. Sir 0. GREY observed that the hon. member for the Tower Hamlets intended to move his amendments on the report. With regard to the Biflhe might state that it originated with the Lord Chief Justice, who found from fact3 that came under his owtn knowledge, that the sale of obscene prints and publications prevailed to a very great exteat, and that much difficulty was experienced in obtaining a conviction against oftenders, or, even when convictions were ob- ed, i preventing the trade being carried on sucessfula . H4e had been in communication with the Lord Chief Justire with reference to certain amendments which he thought wfere called for in the Bill, and these he trusted wvould obviate some of the objections that might be entertained to. wards the meas3ure. MUr. ROEBUCK sympathized as much as the right hon. gentleman could do in the object of the Bill, but he wanted to know how that object could be carried out. Take Wycherley. The works of that dramatist might be found in many a house. It was an obscene book, but did they suppose they could put down Wycherlev9 2(Hear, hear.) Ther was an elegant translation by Staney of an obscene work called the Baeia of Joha-nnm &,-cusdus. It was written originally In beautiful Latin and was a wonderfully fineclassi production, obsene though it was. Did they hope to prevent the sale of such a book as that ? If they began this crusade, where were they to end? Take Aristophane If the opinions of Girek scholars were asked for, thy wuld tell us that he was a wonderful writer, who ouhtt be zPLaced on a level with our Shakspeare, butt every one knew how obscene his works were - and he again a6sk,3d 'would it be possible to put down suchi books by a Bill like thi?(Hear, hear.) If they looked at-the dramatists of the reign of Charles I. they would not find one of thLem whose works were not objectionable on the scoreofobaceulty. (Hear.) Even the works of Pope, eleganxt and beautiful though they were, contailed_passages which no decent woman could say she had read, - the Rfotsat to A bdard, one of the most brilliant poems in the English language, there were lines which he would be ashamed to read aloud. They miht depend upon it that the passions of youth were not halfso much excited by vulgar obscenity as by refined licentious. ness (Har,hea,) heycoud nt lY down a rule, and If thy armd polcemen or oher eran,wt uhrt Dg upon mte honest and manly feeling of the pcope' would do more than could be accomplished byPa tehousand inquiaitorial and despotic Acts of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) Mr. AYRTON expained that the amendment which hi a intended to propose was to the effect that before a cshudbe at liberty, on an ex parte statemnent, to a ouse in search of obscene books or prints It should be proved that some overt act had been committed by the owner in the way of the sale or exposure of objectionable publcations. Before the Biu came on he gave his amendment to the hon. and learned member for Devonport, who had charge of the measure, and who promised to inroduce the provision in question. That had not been done wad the various clauses of the Bill having been agreed to Inahis temporry absence from the Houp8e he found-that he had lest his OPPOrtunity of proposing the amendment himse. He trusted, however that his hon. and learnsd friend would take care to fulfi his Promise at a subsequent stage of the Bil. Sir G. GREY suggested that the hon, and learned mom. ber for Davenport should withdraw his rmotion for the exemption of Scotland, and renew it uPon the report. The amendment of thee ion. and learned miember for the Tower Hamlets might be considered at the same time. Sir F. PERRY adopted the ugestion of the HomeBe ,cretary, stating that his motion a been suggested by the Lord Advocate, who belleved that the existing law in Sct land was quite adequate to the suppresson of the acue. tions abmed at by ehe BDUl He sa no material e= 0clo to the amendament of the hon. anad learned member for the gFewgr JJ&waznt And It it ba bezi propmsd whilo the .lauses were uder consderation he would tot have opposed I it.

NAPIER admitted that theY could not by leg,ilation smake the people virtuous, but expressed his belief that this Bill, if passed into law, would act on the side of public morals. Mr. BRIcSCOE mainAtainea that the power grated bh was not greater than that conferred upon magistrates bY the Act for the suPPrealon of betting-house, and qtuoted meA^ssage fral om the resulted fromo ofPaley to the effect ttthwrtg,publicationbtrmre h,t and ciculassdthon ofl obcn hoos arsnd prnaets^^ wereprdructie of stant muc mihefin from so mcean atemptAtio Theeat few crimes lwitin thereach of rv eic kedness he6 !atd m r tob answe r lvfor or li es to plead Mr. c WHi thought theo Bill pointed to a species of legilhation in which Parliament ought not to indulge without the greatest caution. He admitted that an immeanse deal of mischief resulted from the sale of obscene pulications but remarked that if they passed the Bill in itspreaet spetheywouldrequinesetateto define what obscenity was. There was at presentsa law in Amnerica by which books desnated as obsene were liable not only to confisationr but dogetction, and it happened, curiously enough, that a hook which might be found in the library of that HLiouso-the L M eo Borbonico Napoliesino-had been condemned under the American law, although he had been unable to discover anythig indeocent isn it. (&o laugh.) Some people thought that the naked human figure, except to students of art, was objectionable, and he had even heard -it whisper tha tho literay works of Lord Campbell him slf-hi . of the Lord OhthuceUesand his Lives of the 1Aosd Chief Justices-might and would be masde the subject wa proseutions in tho evemnt of this Bi becomnng law. (Lauaghter.) Mr. M. MILNE had been informed by several respectable bookserers in the metropols that they viewed with dread the Progress of this Bill, notobecause they were capable in any way of infringing the law, but becuse, being accustomed to buy whole libraries and large masses of books, containing miany thousand volumes which it was impossible to examnine thorou~hly in A short time, they really were not acquainted with the nature of all the books which lay in stock In different parts of their l#rge estabhshments at any particular moment. They entertained a well-grounded fear that in a trade where so much comp6tition existed, the Bill, if passed, would enable any man hostilely disposed towards them to give information and declare upon oath that he knew they had some obscene books in their possession. They said the chances were that the allegation might turn out to be true; but even sup. posing that no such books should be found in their possesson -thatn they should be faully acquitted-did the committee not think that the fat of their stockshaving been over. hauled by policemen would of itself seriously damage their character, and prejudicially affect their business as private tradesmen? (Hear, hear.) He believed that the evil complained of was limited to two or three streets in the metropolis which had become notorious for the exhibition and sale of indecent publications, and he was not to be told that they could not provide an adequate temedy withoat establishing a system of domiciliary visits inmost gerous in principle and most injurious to private individual (Hear, hear.) Nothing could be more easy than to arm the police, even on their own information, without the intervention of anybody else, with power to make application for warrants authorizing them whenever they saw indecent books or prints exposed for sale to seize and destroy them. But the B sill wa a clumsy method of meeting the evil, one totally alien to the habits of this country, andc certain in the end to be disgustful to the English people. (Hear, hear.) Mr. MALINS supported the Bill, which, he said, was irte-aded to abate a nuisance of the most abominable characier. Thirty years ago there we-e no fewer than 54 shops for the sale of obscene books and prints existing in London. By means of prosecutions, instituted at various times, the number had been reduced to about 20, but stiU the evil was one of the greatest magnitude. The present law wa unable to provide an adequate remedy, and, although he admitted that the power granted. to,magistrates by this BiU was large aud summary; yet they ought not to be too careful or chary when a gr(tAiiWaaae was to be abated. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member--who spoke last had, no doubt, a biUiard table Sn his house, yet surely be was under no apprehension that he would be subjected to a domiclliaz7 visit by the police under the pretence that he kept a gaing-house. So with regard to the re6spetable bookseller to whom Allusion had been made. 'hey need not fear that warrants would be taken to search their great eollections of books. The object of.the Bill was to put down a notorious and crying evil, and he was con. 'vinced that, as in the case of the Act for the suppresion of betting-houses, the powers granted by tho Bill would not be abused. (Hear, hear.) At the same time he thought that, in the event of a seizure, the owner should have an appeal from the decison of the magstrate as to whether the pro ductions were obsocne or not. What one nagistrate might Call obscene another might regard As perfectly pure, and therefore, instead of glving the magistrate an absolute power to destroy the articles brought before him, he hoped thatthe simplepower of impounding would alone be granted. (Hear, hear.) Mr. ADAMS did not think, with the hon. and learned member fcr Sheffield, that coumtry magistrates would strain or pervert the law in order to discover the Implements of poaching; but at the same time it appeared to him to be desirable, with the view of preventing erroneous decisions where questions of taste were involved, that the proceedings to be taken under the Act should have the sanction of two justimcs instead of one. (Hear, bear.) HIe was afraid that the mischief which the Bill propowd to xemedy was more widespread than many hon. members seemed to sup. pose. The poison was drawn, in thefirt instanoe, from certain'placesin London andour otherlarge towns, and then sent through innumerable channels, indlung poPdlas and persons of that class, to all parts of the country, reachin and corrupting schools and other slmilar establishments. (Rear ear.) Whole streets devoted to the exibition and sale of ye theyra publications existed in the metropolis alone, and y hywere told that the law was utterly powrerless. He thought the country owed a debt of gatitude to Lord Campbell for bringing forward this Bill, to which he would have great pleasure ln givIng his hearty support, (Hear, Sir BE. PE3RRY could not agree to the suggestion of the hon. and learned member for Wallngford wFith resect to an appeal from the decision of the magistrate, but expressed his readiness to consider favourably the amendment recommended by the last spaer, that there should be two jnsHices Instead of one, and suggested that it should be proposed at the nexct stage of the Bill. Mr. J. LOCKE opposed the Bill, and pointed out that the w ord " exhibition" in the first cdause mnight be held to apply to a man who showed another a book or a picture in his own house. Then, again, the phrase " beinQ other. wise published " was mos objectionable. What did ths words mean 1 If ailibellous letter ws handed to one pierson It was deemed publication of libel, and so the exhibition cf an obscene bcook or print to one Person would bring th party wthin the comlpass of the BilL He thoughtefore the measure was allowed to pass very material amendmonts shoald be made in the first clause, and in addition there shounld be the ordinary clause giVig an appea to the qoarter The CHnCELLOR OtfoeEXCE,Q R remindedthe committeethat the onlyqufstlon at present before them was whether ScotKnd shoud bedexempted from the operation of the BilL HEe understood that it had been agreedto that the di ion upon that point should be takenanother day, and therefore he thought It woalad be most convenient to pass over the matter for that day and proceed at once to the gther business upon tho paper. Mr. ROE3BIJCE admitted that they were discussing the Pahole Bwi llpn one of itS laet stes, but the reason for that was to be found In tho hurried maunerin which it had passed through the Hlouse. (Iear, bear.) Therh and learned member for Devonport (Sir E. Perry) in his innocence declared that, has-ing arrived at years of discretion, he did not knowr of one gambling-house in London while in thefiery years of his youth lie was acquainted with many. The change that had taken place with regard to the bun, and learned gentleman was Intellibible, but did he therefore believe that there were no gambting-hopses in L ondon t (hear, hear.) Then take nother class of houses of e-foame, which were Iust as mischievous as gamblinghouses or obscene print shopa . No man who aolked the London streets could deny that such houses abounded in aMost every strecet, and in ome of the beat strcts of the metropolis If Parliament bed been impotent to put down such housea, they wrould be equally impotent to sp press the traffic to whzich this Bill referred. HIe had been acused of libelling the magistracy, but when he remembered that within a few day a magistrate had bee removed from the ench for havlg peraertedathe gamelaws forhi ownme pebrfofter. Deoebuck)Si was Pentitled tos assume that others midhtbte found whorvfo a seiitlr tob jct might avil themselves of the strlngent powers of the Bill. Tey were all agreed upon the desirability of stopping the abominable traffic, but they differed as to the means that shonld be emplohed. By the Bill a single magistrate's decision was supreme upon the question of what was obscene Now, the committee were aware that to some persons naked shtues were obscene. There were persons of pruriue t beagination,swhodwere wel described by Swift when he said had complafined of the statue of the Greek Slave, exhibited at the Crystal Palace, as indecent, although he should have thought that all men of taste would have regarded the cold marble with feelings as cold as the marble itself, but so pruirient'and heated were the imaginatlons'of some that they Positively called the work of art an indecent object. Might not such people be found upon the bench, who would be called upon to act under this Bill? There was a pietum'e in the National Gallery of Venus and Adonis. Supposing that anman,having an engraving of that picture, were charged under this Bill, and the magistrate chose to considler it an obscene prit, hie could order the engravings to be destroyed,whl Parlamntwas now called upon to find money for building a niace wherein to exhibit tn original picture to all the wjrld. There were some Surrey magListates whio wanted to sh'ut up Vauxhall and others who wishxedto put aronson the statues inthe Crystal Palace. If the Bill pawsedin its present shape, a canting, hypocritica justce could declare that what they called work's of art were works of obscenity. Mr. HENLEY thought that the original jurisdictionx ought to begIv to two nmagistrates insea Ofne. It was more dilficult to dec ide upon wNhit was not produced than It was unwhat was prdduced. He also thought that in some sY'peor other thqu, aboeld be aappeaL. (Hear.) * Sir G.

The House hbaving resumed, the report of supply wa brought up. Upon the Tvte for Pimlioo Improvements, Sir EL WLLOUGHBY asked whether the account of those improvements might be considered as settled. The CH}ANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER sid the First Commissioner of Works (SIrB. Hall) was the person who could best answer the question, but he was not at that maoment in the Hous Mr. STAFFOR)D Tegretted the absence of the hon. gentle. man, and remarked that it had become a not unfrequent ooccurree that Ministers were absent at the time when votes were being taken for their particular deprtmento, which prevented the House from obtaining the full informa. tion that was desirable. He should like to know when the explanation required by the hon. baronet would be given. Sir G. GREY sid if any notice had been given to his hon. friend he would oertainly have been in his place. The question could be put at any time. Sir W. JOLIFET observed, that as the House of Commnons had gone on voting sums for the improvement and enlargement of Buckinghams Palce they must now, of neces8ity,go on and Improve the neighbourhood of the pac. Having embarked in this expenditure, which he believed would amount to ih1lf-a-million, they could not now stop short, and he could only hope that In the new street to be built care would be taken to erect a proper clas of houses. Sir IL WILLOUGHIBY explained that it 'Was Imposible for him to have given notioe to the hon. baronet the Com. misdoner of Works, because the vote itelf was not diseussed until between 1 and 12 o'clock last night Sir G. GREY meant to say that had notice been given his hon. friend would have been more open to the censure which had been cA upon him for his absence. Mr. STAFFORD remarked that when he first entered Parliament it was always the custom for a Minister having charge of a department to be in -his place whenever votes affecting that department were disc d. The Report of Supply was then agreed to. TELB BRITISH CHAPEL IN PARIS. Upon the question thatithe Speaker do leave the chair to go into Committee of Ways and Means, Mr. WISE Inquired what steps the Government intended to taWke inrespect to the 2,0001. which had been advanced from the fund for Civil Contingencies for the purchase of a chapel in Parisa transaction which the committee had refused to sanction. The CHANCELLOR of the RXCElQUER said the decision of the House was so recnt that the Government had not had time to come to any determination, but they would tmmediately communicate with Lord Cowley, and after hearing from him would consider the steps they should take. EXPENSE OF BRITISH TROOPS IN IZDITA. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY, seeing the large armament that was preparing for India, wished to know whether the Government intended to throw the whole expeaditure dpon the East India Company, and whether any calculation had been made of the probable expenditure. He understood that nearly 30,000 men were proceeding from this contry to the East, and, if all explanation of the intentions of the Government were postponed, the House would again find itslf in the melancholy position of being called upon to sanction expenditure which had already taken place. The CHANOELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said in Committee of Ways and Means he intended to make a statement in -which the subject adverted to by the hon. baronet would be included. The House then went into Committee of WAYS AND MEANS. TEE TEA AND) SUGAR DUTIES. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said,-It will be in the recollection of the committee that early ia the last sesion I laid before them a proposal for an alteration in the duties on tea and sugar, which were then fised by the existing law. That proposal referred to a period of three years, oommencing from the 1st of April last. I pro. posed a certain triennial le of duties, whiah were higher than the duties that would have been leviable under the theneOxisting law. In consequence of the dissolution of Parliament the Government were called upon to alter their plan. I accordingly withdrew the proposition I had made for a triennial settlement of the duties upon tea and sagar,xtid I afterwards introduced a resolution, and subhequently a Bill, to fix these duties for a year, commencing on the 1st of April last. The propodtion underwent a very full discus sion, and it is unnecessary for me now to repeat the arguments that were then used upon the subject, inAsmuch as, the discussion being so reoent, they are, no doubt, within the recolleotion of the committee. The effect of that alteration of the law was that the dutioa on te and sugar, although fixed at a lower rate than that which existed for the year ending the 1st of April last were fixed at a rate which was higher than that at which they would have stood if that Act had not passed. But the rate was llxei only for the year commencing the 1st of April last, and ending the 1st of April, 858. The resolution which I have no placed in your hands, Sir, is not intended to make any alterntion in the duties upon tea and sugar which are leviable under the exsting Act until the lst of April next, and, although it does purport to substitute certain duties for those existing from the present thie, nevertheless it mikes no change in those duties up to the 1st of April next. The object which I really have In viev! Is to continue for two years from tbe 1t of April next the duties which are now leviable by law up to that date. It is a mesnure ubstantiaUy to carry iato effect the proposition I made at the beginning of the session I with respect to the two years from the Ist of April next and which was dropped in consequence of the dissolution. The committee will understand that I do not propose to make any alteration in the Ways and Means for the existing year, but I merely propose to continue the existing duties as they stand at present for two years from April next I shoulad not have felt it my duty to make any proposition now with regard to the tea and sugar duties any more than with regard to the income-tax, for which I also proposed a triennial settlement, Were it not for the circumstance that, with respect to articles which are imported, as in the case of tea entirely, and sugar partially, from great distances, it is expedient to give as long a notice of the intended duties as Is possible (hea, hear); because a short notice is extremely embrrassing and disadvantageous to merchants and traders, and, moreover, prevents the consumer from obtaining the full benefit which might be derived from the existing rate of duties If I had delay(d maldng any proposition upon the subject of a change in the duties payable after April next until the month of February or Mrch I should have been told, and truly no, that that was too short a notice to give to the trade. I therefore ihought it was incumbent on me to make my proposition at the end of the present session, in order to give ample notica to all persons Interested In the matter. I laid upon the tabl3 at the beginning of July a very full return on the subject of the duties on tea and sugar, aud if hon. gentlemen ha&j perused that docament I am sure they have found it to contain more complete and more authentic information upon the subject of the consumption of tea and sugar in th;s country than was ever before included within the same compass. Assuming, therefore, that the committee have had an opportunity of consulting that document, it will be unnecessary for me to make any lengthened statement upon that subject. I would, however, venturo to call the attention of the committee to one or two facts bhaing upon this question. The amount of revenne raised from the sources wo aro now considering may be taken in round figures to be about 10,56,00000 a-year. The sugar dutles in the year 1855 produced 5,058,000z; and in 1856, 5,129,6494 The t duties in 1855 produced 5,310,275e; and in 1856, 5,536,6264 The average revenue for the las' two years from tea and sugar has been 10,517,525l Therefore it will be seen that a very large revenue is at stake with reference to the duties of tea and sugar. (Heil. E There is also another fact to which I beg to call the atten. tion of the committee. I fuUy concur with all that can be said as to the benefit which all classes of the oommunity, I and especially the worldng classes, would derive from a ze- duction in the duties on tea and sugar. (Hear, hear.) The returns on the table show how Increased consumption has been the consequence of reduotion in the price of those articles. They suggest strongly the making-and I regret that It is not in our power, looking at the present and prospective expenditure of the country, to be able to makefurther reductions in those duties. There is, however, this consolatory consideration, that the duties fixed by the present Act are lower with respect to tea and eugar than they have been at any previous time. With regard to sugar the duty may have been lower at some time in the last few yeas, but with regard to tea the daty is lower than at any previous time. (Hear, hear.) The war duty on te lst year was ls. 9d., and it is fixed at present at Is. 5d. per lb. The average duty on sugar last year was 14s. 6d., and it is now about 14s. per ort,, though In the common sorts there is a difference of about 2s. 6d. per cwt. With regard to tea, there is a very material reduction as compared with a year as late as 1852. In 1852 and up to that time for a series of years tho duty was 2s. 2id., whereasit is now Is. cd. per lb. (Hear.) The committee will find in the papers before the House an account which I have obtained dnoe the and of hlst session, with a view of showitg the comparative consumption of tea and sugar by diffeopt classes of society. Sueh a retirn has never been qbtmind before, and I will, with the permission of the commniuee, state hortlr what appears to be the compative conuaptlon of differenet classe in different parts of the united kingdom. With regard to tea, it appears on the but information tha ca be obtained that In England the upper aud middle clses consume B6por oent. of the whole quantity, and the poorer and working dlaes con, me 44#p esw. In seotlad the upper and middle clase onsume a4 per oent, and the poorer and working clas 46 per een%, The propmUoti in England and Scotla L ry -4 IP narly the nme. But with regard to Ireland the ratio is revera. The upper ad middle classes cosunme 33& per cent., and the poorer and working clse consume 64; per cent. There is considerable difficulty In accounting for this diffrence, assuming the retuns to be correct, and the only suggestion that I can make is that, owing to the snallneas of the middle clas in Ireland compared with the rest of the community, and the great proportion of poor to the entire community, in comparison with England and Scotland, the cosnsmption is greater by the poor of Ireland, though it is smaller by the poor of England and Scotland. (Hear.) With regard to sugar, it appears that In England the upper and middle claes consume 60 per cent, and the poorer and workdng-classes 40 per cent. of the total quantity. In Scotland the upper and middle clAmses coosme 62 per cent. and the poorer and worldng classes 38 per cent. Again, the same ratio is reversed in Ireland. In Ireland the upper and Diddle es are tated to comnsme 34 per cent., and the poorer and working classes 66 per cent. Mr. STAFFORD.-How do you divide the clases? The CHNCEILLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-hey are not divided by me, hut by the persona who made the return. Like many other divisions it is a division de crai4 There is no precise line to be drawn; but in the same manner there is no precise line to be drawn between moderate heat aud excesdve heat. Nevertheless there is an intelligible line which any person can draw. Sir I. WIILOUGHBY.-Upon what bases are those calculations founded ? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUE -The returns are obtained in Ireland from the Poor Law Commis. gioners, and In England and Scotland partly from the Board of Inland PEevenue, and parly from the Board of Customs. The returns have been obtained with great care, but may be liable to error. I give them to the committee as the best Information it is in my power to obtain. I think they wiU admit that the subject is worthy of consideration. I shall be, of course, very happy if any correction can be suggest3d, and all the materials are submitted to the Honue. (Hear.) With regard to the duty on sugar I cannot, on the whole, consider it a very exoessive duty as compared with the price. The average prlce of sgar in bond for the six years from 1851 to 156 was IZ. 5g. lac. per cwt. The average duty may now be taken to be 14s. Therefore, the committee will see that it is a duty which, as compared with the price, is not excessive. With regard to tea, I regret to Say the duty, as fixed at present, bears a greater proportion to the price, and undoubtedly, if our financil postion admitted of any moderation of these daties, the duty on tea would seem. to have a stronger claim on consideration. The average price of tea in bond for the same sIx years was is 2id. per pound. The duty at present is is od. Thereforo, the duty on tea, taking the avenre pnc, is more tau ID00 per cent., which is a high duty, and, looking to the consumption of the oountry, It would be very desiable, if our financial position permitted, to reduce it. Fear, hear.) But there is one circumatance to which I am eaeirons of calling the attention of the committee with respect to the operation of these duties. What realy affects the consumer and the extension of consumption is, of oourse, the price which he has to pay. The price is partly affected by the duty, but also by other causes independent of the duty. Therefore, in looking at the increase or dimi. nution of consumption, it is neessary to bear in mind not only the increase of duty, but the variation of price, which may be greater than any alteration of daty, although by different causes. I wiU venture to caU tho attention of the committee to an illustration of this remark. The smallest conEmnption of sugar per head since 1816 was In 1840. Comparing the two years 1839 and 1840 the eonsumption stands as follows :-In 1839 3,830,393 cwt; i 1840, 3,594,412 ewt. Ia 1839, the average dt was 4s.; In 140, it ws . 5s. 2d. Increased duty in the latter year Is. 2d. per cwt. Taking the facts of a diminution of consumption in the latter year and an increse of duty, a person would naturally say there is the explanation of the diminution of consumption. But when we look further we find other causes rmuch more operative. In 1839 the average price in bond was LL 19. 2d. In 18I4 it was 2Z. 9s.ld., sowing an incrase of 9.l. Ud. The average price, Inclusive of duty, in 1839 ws .3s.2d. In xI4O t Ws 14s. 3 de in tho total price o' llld.,lof whichonly is. ldo was due to the increase of duty. Therefore it is nifest that the great diminution of consumptionwhich occurred in the Latter yearwas mainly attributable to the natural increae ofrice.ad not, to any grextextent, to an inerease of dut. rillustration nsm tpk the I two years, 1855 and 1856. In 1855 the consumption was 7,547,157 ewt. * in it s 7,071,515 wt In 1855 the averapg dbty was 13 5d. ; in 1856 it was 14s. 6d., being an increase of Is. Id. Looking at the diminished consnmption and the increased duty, a person might say that is the cause. But then it must be borne in mind that in 1855 the average price in bond was 1L 6s. 9d., and in 18561. 9s. 7d., being an increase of the price in bond of 2s. 10d. The average Price, inclusive of duty, in 1855 21. 0s. 2d. ; and in 1856 21. 4s. id., being an increase of 3s. ld., of which only is, ld. was due to the increased duty. That also shows that the principal cause of diminished consumption was the natural increase of price, owing to the diminished supply, and not to any great extentto the increace of the duty.Under thosa circum. stances, I trust the committee will agree to the resolutions which I have placed in the hands of the Chairman, antho. rising me to found a Bill Upon theM to continue for two yeas from the ist of April next the existing duties on tea and sugar. (Hear, hear.) I will now revert to the question put to me by the hon. baronet opposite (Sir IL Willoughby) with respect to the probable demands on the Exchequer in aid of the finances of the East India Comp ny. The proposal which I now make wMll not add anythng ta the Ways and Means of the current year. It makes no alteration whatever with respect to the yer ending the 1st of April next. It only proposes to arrest the fall of duties which would otherwise occur at that period, and to continue the existg dute fora*term of two yeam It seems to be ex. pected cy the hon. gentleman-and there seems to be in the minds of the public an Impression-that it will be incumbent on Her Majesty's Government to make some proposal before Parliament separates, with the view of assisting the Indian Treasury. In the present state of public affairs in India it hs been my duty, and the daty of Her Majest%s Government, to commnunicate with the Chairman of t e East India Company on t subject, and the East India Company have been informed that the Government were ready to take into consideration any representations which they might malca with respoect to any change in the lAw which they might wish to proPose as to their power of borrowin money, or wit respect to any financial assstance whioE they might wish to receive from the Government by consent of Parliament. But the directors, having investigated the question, did not fnd that they were in a position which made it necessar that they should apply to the Government at presentforanysuc assistance. (Hear,hear.) Thepresent fincial means of the East India Company are ample. Their present difficulties, great and formidable as they nndoubtedly are, are not of a financial kind. of course it is impossible to say how soon fnancial exigencies may occur, but in the existing state of the Ast India treasury we ar informed, and we entertain no doubt, there are ample mess of nmeeting any demand likely to be made on the Indian Exchequer. Under those circumstances, Her MAjesty's Government, s at present advised-subject,of course, to infornmtion which may at any moment arrive-do not feel called upon to submit to Parliament any proposition with regard to assistanoe to be afforded to the East India Compan. I can say. therefore, that the Ways andpleans which sheliberaltyofParliament has placed at tha disposalof the executiveGovernment appear, as far as I am able to judge, to be am p a for meeting the probable wants of the present financil year. (Hear, hear.) If the Government ha any reason to doubt their sufficiency they would not be slow in bringing the matter under the consideration of this House, in ful confidenoe that any want which could be established with regard to finance, and that any demand for expenditure which could be proved by demonstrative evidence to be required for the interests, the defenoe, and the welfare of the country, wonld be farnished by the liberality and publio spirit of this House. (Cheers) The Government are not restrained by any doubt of the willingness of this House to meet any reasonable demand on their part; but, as far as they are able to judge, there is no imm eiate reason for making such a demand.-I will merely remind the House that up to the present time all the demands upon the Exchequer of this country have been satisfied from the Ways and Means of the ourrent year. We bavealreadydischaged2,000,0001. of Exchequer-bonds which fell due in the month of April last; and within the last few days a considerable sum in res t of the redemption of the Sound Dues has been paid. lnowithstanding those lnargeyments, one of which was in redemption of debt and ge other in a matter equivalent to the extinction of debt, yet the growing revenue of the year appears at present adequate for the demands of the counntry, and, nc4wlthetanding the large shipments of troops to India, I do not anticipate at present any Inadequay of Ways and Mieans to cover the expenditure of the year. (Hear, hear.) I will merely add, In reference to what feUl from the hon. baronet, that he is no doubt aware that as soon as regi ments are transferred to the service of the East India Company they become charable to the revenue of India, and cease to be chargeable to the revenue of this country. *Therefore, so far as measures have at present goe, they have produced rehef rather than burden to the Excheqer of country. The dissolution of tbe Bengal army, however disastrouds &a event to the Indian empire, is nevertheless Immediately attended with a diminution of ex-pens., inasmuch as the pay of about 40 regiments, with the exception of the British officer_s, at once ceases. The Immediate effect is not to bring any great charge upon the Indin or English Excbequer, and the principa loss to the Indian Government arises from the plunder of their treasuries and the cessation of the collction of taxes in the disturbed provinoes. But the places of the regiments sent to India I be filled by recruits. eocruiting is, of course, a gradual prooess, and the expense attending the supplying the regiments abipeed for India comes on by degrees, and when it is carned to the ful extent only creates a charge equal to that removed by the departure of those regiments.My noble rend at the head of the Government has already expblned, with regard to the embodied mil, that It is our intention to call out regiments only so far as ma& be necessary, in consequence of tie slow prooess o. recru g; but it is not anticipated that tne voto to which the House agreed lat night of 100,0001. will be insfflcient, and possibly the whole of that vote will not be required. Under these circumsances, as I stated before, I do 4otat present anticipate that I shall have to make an further -proposiions to the House in Committee of Waes aid a or in Committee of Supply beyond 'what are now on the table, and I trst that, after these explantions, the 'realntions in the bands of the Chairman will receive the assent of the- commkittee.

(Hear, hear.) There is one statement of the right hon. gentleman upon which I have the inisfortune to differ from him, and I cannot allow it pass without recording my protest against it. He speaks of having paid off 2,000,0001. of Exchequer-bonds and provided for the Sound Dues, as if in either of those operations he were extingauihing debt, or performing a procem analogous to the extinction of debt, out of the Ways and Means of the year. I do not wish to revive arguments which we have had at great length, but, so far as the Sound Dues are concerned the case is this :-In the years 1856 and 1857, by the esercise of borrowing powers to a considerably greater extent than the ultimate expenditure required, there were large balances of borrowed money in the Exchequer, and out of those balances the Government applied 1,000,000., and something more, to the extinction of the obligation contracted with respect to the Sound Dues The Sound Dues were just as much discharged out of borrowed money as if a special loan bad been rLised for the purpose. (Hlear, hear.) As respects Exchequer-bonds, so far from considering that we have liquidated 2,000,000L out of what may be regarded as legitimate Ways and Means, I con. tend not only that those 2,000,0004, but that 2,000,000X or 3,000,0001. more, which we are applying to Ways and leans, ought to be appUed to the liquidation of pLblic debt in redemption of the pledge given by Parliament; and next seoson It will be nocessary to review that subject at greater length. (Hear.) As respects the general matter of the peoech of the Chanoellor of the Exchequer, I am glad to understand from him that the East India Company are ia such a state as regars finanoes that he contemplates they wil be able from their own resouroes to meet for the probable period of six months the heavy charges of operations which must be undertaken in that country. If that be the cae, I entirely agree both with the authorities of the Company and with the right hon. gentleman in the wisdom of not making any present application to this House. (Hear.) Inwhat he said he perhaps alluded to what fell from me when I respectfuUy tendered to the Government my advice, that if they foresaw the coming necessity of rendering pecuniary aid to the Indian Goverumaeat they should render a portion ofthat aid at once. But I quite agree that if the resources of India are in such a stato as the right hon. gentleman represents them, it is much better to avoid any demand at the presont. Grave as is the crisis, most weighty as may be many of the matters raised and discussed with great ability by the right hon. gentleman the member for Buekinghamshire, yet I confess I incline, in common with the hon. and gallant membofor Aberdeen (Colonel Sykes), who addressed the Hose very recently and very admirbly (hear), to the opinion that there is nothing absolutely unreasonable in the hope that, by the blessing of Providence, the head of this mutiny, gigantic s it is, may be crushed, and certainly, so far as positive evidence goes, I cannot see the evidence upon which the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamahire interprets this mutiny into general disaffection. (Cheers.) In the rewolutions there Is no reference whatever to Indian affais. We are not going to increase Ways and Meaus, nor to make provision, directly or indirectly, in reference tothe state of Indian affirs. If any such necessity should arise it will be dealt with hereafter, but we are going to make an addition to the Ways and Means of the next two years in the form of indirect taxes, which my right hon, friend will be the first to admit are of a highly exceptional chuacter, (Hear, hear.) I cannot fid fault with him for making that proposal to the committee. On the contrary, I think he has exercised a wise discretion iR making the proposal now, and in that manner giving fnU notice to all persons commercially interested in the great trades, tea and sugar, rather than postponing it to a future session of Parliament. It may perhaps be thought strange that I, who offered the best resistaloo in my power when it was proposed to increase the tea and sugar duties, should now follo w a different course But all the considerations which led me to offer that resistanee prove how improper it would be to renew it. At the period of redstance Parliament was under no pledge with reference to the great questions before the country. Parliament had done nothing to affirm in any manner the policy of the Government with respect to the Persian war; and with regard to the expendituro for the Persian war, it was estimated at an amount altogether trifling. Respect. ing the war in China, so far from having ap proved, the House passed a vote in condemnation of that policy. (Hear.) The estimates which were presented in the early part of the year were presented as peace estimates, and it was a most imprtant question for consideration en what scale our peace estemsas ought to be framed. The question of military force is intitately connected with the spirit of our foreign policy. The pirlit of our foreign policy, along with the estimates, has sinoe then passed under the review of the country, and I am bound frankly to own that the opimion of the country with respect to that foreigu poc,mngtm y b only temporary, dfera wridely fromn mine. It appears, therefore, plaini that nothing can be more unfair than, when the country is disposed to recommend a policy involving great expenditure, to interfere with the right hon. gentleman, who, as -Minister of Finanoe, wishes to make timely provision, so far as is in his power, for that expenditure. (ear.) There is another point niost perplexing and embarrassing to my mind, and that is, the important scale of movement in the misellaneous estimates We have not only to look back to the rapid increase in those estimates extending over weveral years, but we have to consider wrat aro the prospects for the future, and I am sorry o say that in my humble and conscientious opinion those prospects are still more gloomy and perplexing It is quit true that on ,articulir occasions we cavil with or make legitimate objections to some proposal of the Government. We have induced them to postpone voting a museum in Edinburgh, which I am bound to say is a perfectly reasonable requirement, on a moderate scale; nd we have struck ont a vote for a chapel at Paris. These things are all very weU in their way, but in the ma jority of cases they are not instances where we retrenob, but rather instances where we adjourn the charge. As regards the general gle of the miscellaneons estimates, it Is impossible that they should be effectally cut down in this Houe It is the Government, and the Government only, wisely and firmly supporteW b this Hose, that can possibly cut them down (Hear, hear Imay, perhaps, be of a censorious disposition, but I frankly own that the views of the Governsment with regard to pubhl economy are not my views; but, if they were, is the Government firmly and justly supported by this House? What bas happened in the last fortnight? nave we not seen a BiU carried, which I believe unpreoedented in our history, for the wholesale increase of the slares of publc servnts, in the fae of an announoement supported by detiled tements fromn the Government to the effect that, if weo vote for that Bill, we mnust be pre. aed tosee apermanentaddition totbe pubic burdens of 200,000. a-year.

Sir Il WILLOUGHBY sid, it was mot at all cealy proved that the deduotions were toolarge for the allowances made. All the evidenoe went to showr that that questio was not yet satisfactorily decided. Ms opinion wa that the Exchequer in the end would be a los ernitA of a ner as was generally upposed H rea or opposi the Bill was, that he looked nwon it Hsa ery EMunstoesmanlzke mode of settling the question. He had no intention of oppodng the proposition of the Chanoellor of the Exchequer now before the committe, although he was of opinion=tat there were other articles] which oould better bezr a inceae ot taxation than tea. He did not attuah an great weight to the calculations which the Chanoellor of the Exchequer had entered into u to the tsa oornumed by the different classes of the community. It was difficult to tell how onsumption went. The lower cls oonsumed almost as mnuc of thelhigher.prloed teMa the dpper clsse The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUEBL-I did not sy anything about the quality of the tea consumed by different classes; it was only the quantity of which I was talking. Sir E. WILLOUGHBY.-The colculations as to the quantity even eonld not be very trutdworthy. He was gla to hear that the East India Company did not feel it necessazy to apply to Her Majestys Government for any pcuniary aid at present. It wa, however, but a postponed demand. Considering the financial difficulties which had taken place In India during the lut five yea the falling off which there would be in the revenue, and the greaD expenses which would be neoesay in orain departments, sooner or later the Indian Government must come to the Imperial Exchequer for ane. He was of opiniorn that we were apidly drifting to an enormous deficiency. It must be borne in mind that a lage portion of the ways and means of this year oonsited of money borroweed for the Russian war which had not been reeded. It had never yet been clearly stated how much of the money borrowed for the Russian war had actually been spent for that purpose. Considering that none of this mnoney would appear in the ways and means of next year, and tbAt the Clancelor of the Exchequer would also lose a considerable portion of the income-tax, a deficiency was inevitabl. Mr. THORNELY understood the proposition now before the committee to be to extend the present duties Olt tea and sugar, which otherwise would be reduced on the lsb of April next, to the year 1860. (Her.) If that were so he wished to know howi much money the Chanellor of tho Exchequer expectod to gain by this resolution ? Yr. WIUAiS did not see the neessity of tis meur. It was not to take effeet before next April, and it would have been quite early enough had it been proposed the first thing next session. Two months' notise were quite sffafcient for the trade. He objectedto truting the eohequer with a balance, for he remembered that it was because he. bad a. balance in the Exchequer that the rigt hon. gentecam had consented to the payment of 1, 000,0W for there. demption of the Sound duea M.r. HAIFIELD thounght that all the blame of extra. vagnt expenditure ought not to becast on the Government. There were may cses for which the ouse W responsible, and he had on several occasions gone Into the lobby with the Government aganst propodtions to vote sums of money for paricular purposes to whch they were op posed. Mr. DISRAELL-I Lm glad that we are not called upon to enter into the oomplicated question of Indian finance. It is not probable that we shall be favoured thix year witll an Indian budget, but it is extremely expodient that the House, prior to some appeals which maybe made upor lt should cndeavour to obtain a more ocurate knowledge of our Indian finanes t the time of the pasing of the charte it was agreed that a guarantee fund of 2,000,0003. should be established, to accumulate at compound interest, to form asecurity for the Indin stock, for whicb the British Government then virtually became responsible. It is of the utmost importauce that We should know the state of that fund. We ought to be informed whether thlt investment was regularly made, and whether the intres was invested in a proper manner, and we ought also to have the amount of the whole umm fairly before us. I moved about a week ago for a return of that mature, bat it ha not yet been presented, though I should have thought it was as simple and straightforward s iti imortant. I agree -wih the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the calculation which he has made of the comparative consumption Of tea and sugar among the differentclasses. Themurmursof sceptieaL= which proceeded from the hon. baronet behind must have arisen from a misconception of what the Chanollor of the Exchequer said. The estimate which the ihthon. gentle. man gae u I not by any means a fanciful one. It is founded on calcuations made by a gentleman who has given great pains to the subject, and whose esuts have enerally oeen cknowledged to be authentic. This calcultion pro. ceeded byrway of an anlysis of the population of tho country and the amount of tea and sugar onsumed per head, and it was shown by it that the majority of the consumers of tea aud sugas must be ranked amog -what are called the superior classes. For instanoe, domestic servants figure in the population to the amount of 1,500,0001. They are great consumers of tea and sugar, and a they for the most part consome the tea andsuar provided by theirmastes and mistreses, the ere therefore very jstly. for the purposes of this Ical tion, ranged among consumers of the higher and middle cla, and in tbat way it turned out that the mraority of the consumers of tea and sugR belonged to the Superior classe, anal ysis n u removed an impre mlon which has long been prelent in this country that the pressure of these indirect taxes is mainly borne by the, working ces. I understood the hon bronet to object also, to the system which he says at present prevails ot furnishing ways and means from borrowed money. I thla he must have misunderstood what fell from the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford on this point, for I cannot believe that the right hon. geteman. expressed any opinion that the ways anad men of ths) present year had been furnished in any way by bolroerl money. No doubt there is apropect of a consderable de ficiency, for reasons which I hadanopportnetyof explinin at the commenoement of last semion thatyonhavethi year received an amount of war income-tax of Dot Ima than 3,000,0001, whichyou will not receve next year. As. far as that is concerned you must be prepared for a vast deficiency; but borrowed money does not at all figure im our ways and means When the hon. baronet asys that the, Sound dues were paid out of borrowed money- Sir H.

Mr. DISRAELL-Well, then, I should be glad if the. hon, baronet would point olut wlat portion of the expenditure was defryed by borrowed money, for the matter in one of considerable importanoe. Ther ig no doubt watever that the Sound dues were paid out of the balane in the Exchequer, and if there had been no balanoe the CbshceUor of the Exchequer, as he kld us, woeLA have borrowed the moneyon terminable annluties, But theSounddues do not appea intheeeimates;y are mo part of the Comumittee of Supply, and no borrod money, therefore, enters into our ways and means.

MOE Y-MABEBTand OITYIYTUMxIGxNOB. Wednesdy Evening. A universal report of bad nows from India after regular hours to-day wholly counteracted a slight improvement of tone wbich had previously been exhibited in the funds, and ultimately led to stock being offered at a considerable faLL Consols for money, which left off last evening at 89k, were first quoted 89i to 90k, at which for some time they steadily remained. Weakness was then manifested from unexplained causes, and a reaction occurred to 891 to 90. But the public again showed a disposition to effect purchases, and the last official transctions were at 90 for money and 9(, to i for the account. Many of the operators, however, still remained in the city, anxiously looking for the arrival of the telegraph, and shortly after 4 o'clock some sales were effected, and the market instantly gave way. Although nothing had been received at the India-house, the conviction soon became general I that news had been transmitted, and the statement eventually was that it had been announced in a despatch from Cagliari that Delhi had not fallen; that the mutiny had spread to seven or eight other stations, and that there was much pressure in the Calcutta money-market. Consols were accordingly offered at a fresh decline of a half per cent., -namely, at 897 for the account; but there were apparently no buyers, and the actual impression created was therefore only partially tested. A s- suming the intelligence to be true, should it prove that the new outbreaks have not been attended with very disastrous circumstances, and that the Bombay and Madras armies remain loyal, the mere fact of Delhi remaining uncaptured will probably not be viewed by the public as a calamity, since there was a general opinionthatif it had fallen toan inadequate force our own losses must have been terribly great, while the majority of the mutineers could hardly have failed to effect their escape. Much wiLl depend on the particulars as to the additional reinforcements which may have been received from the troops destined for China or other sources. Should it appear that the small number of British troops have been even but moderately strengthened, the confidence of the public will st3ll be maintained; otherwise the period between the present mail and the next will be one of the most anxious intervals in British history. Bank Stock left off at 215 to 2l6i; Reduced,i 90O to.0; New Three per Cents., 90* to .0; India Stock, 212 to 213; India Bonds, 30s. to 20s. discount; and :Exchequer-bills, 6s. to 2s. discount. In the Stock-Exchange to-day loans on Government securities were readily obtainable at from 5 to 5i per cent. In the discount-market there was no alteration. In the foreign stock-market business was rather [active, and prices showed a tendency to advance. The transactions, however, were all concluded before the Indian rumours had become current. In Turkish there was a further small improvement. 'hilian Six per Cents. were negotiated at 103i ditto Three per Cents., 78k ; Danish Five per Cents., 103; Mexican, 22k i; Peruvian Three per Cents., 55, Russian Five per Cents., ] 12i; Spanish New Deferred, 25g; Turkish Six per Cents., 949, i, and 94; ditto, for the account, 941 i ; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 99g B; Venezuela Four-and-aQuarter per Cents., 324 ~; Belgian Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 97,; D)utch Two-and a-Half per Cents., 64k-; and the Fourper Cent. Certificates, 99. The corn-market was. firmn thin morning at the rates of Monday. The final quotations of the French Three per per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. for money and 6,f. 15c. for the end of the month, showing a fractional decline. About 38,0001. in gold was withdrawn from the Bank to-day. Thnis sudden demand was wholly unexpected, as a considerable portion of the surms just received from America is understood to be en the market for sale. The amount is supposed to have been taken for shipment to Belgium to pay for silver. A report on the affairs of Messrs. Carr, Brothers, and Co., of Niewcastle, was submitted to-day to the principalecreditors by Mr. Coleman, the accountant. tappears that the debts of the firm amount to 700,0001., and that MIr. Coleman considers the assets will yield 20s. in the pound, provided the collieries are carried on. The latter T)oint is one of great moment not only to the credit6rs, but to the people of Newcastle, since the number of men employed on the works is upwards of 2,000. On the whole, a favourable view was taken of the case, and there seems to be a general disposition to concur in the requisite arrangements to avert the consequences that would ensue from a permaient stoppage. At a meeting of the English and Australian Copper Company, held to-day, Sir W. Foster in the chair, the reports of the directors and committee of conference were adopted, and a dividend declared of 2s. 6d. per share. A protracted discussion took place, in the course of which an amendment recommending the appointment by the Board of Trade of an inspector to investigate the affairs of the company was negatived. The suggestions of the late committee of conference-viz., to continue operations upon the basis of the new contract with the Burra Burra Company to register under the Limited Liability Act, and to regulate other minor proceedings-were ordered to be carried out, and a new committee was appointed. The accounts showing a deficiency of 116,5801., the directors declined to take the initiative in declaring the dividend, which was therefore proposed and seconded by two private shareholders. The adverse reports regarding the forthcoming statement of the Ottoman Bank were satisfactorily contradicted to-day by an intimation that the dividend to be recommended for the half-year is at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum, and that a balance of 15,0001. will remain to form the basis of a reerved fund. The following vessels have been taken for the conveyance of troops to the East :-The Hydaspes steamer for Ceylon, the Scotia steamer and the Matilda Atheline for Bombay, and the Alipore and Athlete for Kurrachee. Mr. Estcourt brings on his motion on the Euphrates Valley Ilailway to-morrow (Thursday) evening, it having been unavoidably postponed last Friday, in consequence of the absence of Lord Palmerston.
TRADE REPOBT. Wednesday Evening. SUGAR.-The market continues extremely flat. At publio sale to-day l2lhhds Porto Rico, and 193hhds Caba muscovado were withdrawn at full rates; and of 1,643 boxes Havannah only a few lots were sold at a redaction of Is. 6d. as cnmpared witli Friday, the quo#atlons being for brown 47s. to 48s., and for low to ridMIn yellow, 49s. 6d. to 62s. 6d. per owt. 205hhds West India have been sold privately, and another floating cargo of white Havannah is reported at 66s. per owt. COFFE-A further quantity of. 3,780 bags Costa Rica was brought forward to-day at auction; upwards of 3,000 bag were damaged, and sold freely; the small portion siound brought from 64s. to Ts. per cwt. The plantation Ceylon, 116 casks, 9D barrels and bags, went at cheaper pricee-72a,6d. to 73s. for fne fine ordiar, and 73s. 6d. to 76s. for low middling to middling. RICX.-No transactions to report. SALTPXrRB-A moderate business, at about provious rates, and of nitrate of soda a floating cargo of 450 tons is mentioned. Jwre.-Of the 913 sales brought forward a part was held for stiffer rates. TAuLow.-The market is fim to-day. Very little done on the spot or for delivery next month, for want of ecllers. 62s. isnearest price for either; for the end of the year 59s. 9d. Is paid.
RAILWAY AND MIRTO' SABRE& Wednedy Fvening. In the railway-market to-day the fluctuations have been considerable. A fall of 21. occurred in Great Northem Great Western, North-Western, and Midlend also receded, while thc recovery in Eastern Counties was not fully maintained. Oa the other hand, Caledonian and Berwick improved. Grand Trunk of Canada again declined I1. Great Western of Canada, Madras, antd Great Indian IPeninsula were lower; Sainde were rather higher. In foreign shares a small advane, took place in Northern of France and Paris and Lyons. In nmiscellaneous seourities there was an improvement of 11. in Electric Telegraph, and a slight reduction in English and Australian Copper.
msrTENsv FORGERY OF NAvy BILLS.-A repatably-dressod young man, wvho gavo the name of Charles roahowtay, was yesterday place before the magistrates at Roc str, chargod witlx being cocred in uttering a number of forged navy bills, wvheraby the Admialty have recently beendefrauded to a considerable amount. Some time ago a number of blank navy bills were discovered to have been stolen from the Admiralty, and, having been filled up for various amounts, were, in a somewhat Ingenious manner, putin cirolation, the Admiralty being thus lrgely defrauded. Every effort has been made to trace the parties concerned in the forgeries, and only recently a lieutenant of the Royal Navy was oonvicted of being concerned in utterIng one of these forged docaments, and sentenced to a term of transportation. The prisoner, who there is every reason to believe has carried on a very successful career at Port;mouth and Plymouth, entered the branch of the London and Cotuty Bank at Chatham on Tuesday, and presented an officer's fVpay navy bill for the sum of 46g. 8s., purporting to be signed by Captain Charles Froderick, and also by Lieutenant W. G. H. Morgan, both of the President, 51 recently paid off at Chatham. The prisoner, whose air ana manner were sufficient to throw any one off his guard, requested cash for the bill, and, in reply to the maaaeger or the branch bank, gave the name of Mr. J. M. Marks, igh Constable of Chatham as a referenoe. The manager, how. ever, refused to cash tge bill vuness the prisoner obtained the endorsement of some respectable individual at Chatham. After leaving the bank the prisoner proeeeded to the shop of Mr. Marks, army agent, and, having expressed his intention of making some purchases, he presented the forged bill in questIon. He stated that hi rname was WiliAm Butler (whieh name was on the biil), and that he had received the document from Lieutenant Morg at Valparaiso. He also further stated that he was a J or officer on board the Chesapeak, 51, now fitting for sa at Chatham. Both these shtements being found to bo false, and the signatures to the bill forgernes, the prisoner was given into custody, but made his escape, being only captured after a smart chase. The Admiralty having expressed their intention to proeoute, the prisoner was remanded until Wednesday next, when it is expected that a number of similar charges will be brought against him.

RAIL WAY INTELLIGAENCE. I GREAT VV'P-RTFIZV- The foliowing report of the directors of this company wil be submitted to the proprietors at the forty-fourth half yearly meeting on Friday next at Bristol:- "The directors cannot present to the proprietors the usual review of the general affairs of the company without expre8sing, in the first instanoe, their sincere regret at the diminution of the balance at this time disposable for a dvit. dend, consequent upon the very recent operlngg of m6!3 than 90 miles of new railway. It seems to them very important that the precise causes of such reduction in tho dividend upon the consolidated stock should be accurately explained and understood, in order to remove exaggerated apprehensions of the amount of the differenoe, or of the probable duration of such diminised dividends. It was well known to the proprietors generally, at the commencement of this year, that the company were on the point of completing all their Parliamentary engagements for new undertakings; some of which had been already pro. tracted beyond the authorized time for construction. Within the past 12 months, but principally during the autumn and winter, 91 miles of new railway have been brought into use in the south of England, traversing agricultural districts only, with an addition of 26 stations, which have subjected the revenue toalltheworking charges, as well as the interest upon the capital expended. They consist of the following portions of the Wilts, Somerset, and Weymouth Railway, with other branch lines, viz.:Warminster to Salisbury, 20 miles; Frome by Yeovil to Weymouth, 534; Bathampton by Bradford to main line, 94; Uxbridge Branch, 24; Didaot Avoiding Line, 1; Western Fork at Beading, i; Henley Branch, 4i; total, 91i miles. With the single exception of the Devizes Branch to Melkaham (84 miles), which hs bean sinoe opened for public traffic, the foregoing lines completed the entire system of railways belonging to the company. Experience has proved that the revenue derived from lines of that character, mainlydependentuponthelocajpopulftion and produce of the district;, is comparatively small at the commencement, andelow indevelopoment; but nevertheless requiring every aid, in working facilities, to stimulate the growth and increase of such traffic. Although the Salisbury and Weymouth Railways, for instance, as important thoroughfares to the whole southern coast of Englnd, and even to places across the Channel, worked In connexion with the Great Western system, must in time become remunerative for the outlay upon them, it can scarcely be a matter of surprise that at the oommencement and during the winter half-year tho traffic upon those lines has been disproportionate to the amount of indispensable worling expen. diture. It must be remembered, too, as a faot, that while the line between Warminster and Salisbury has been employed principally in the oonveyance of local agricultural produce and coals, it has become, in connexion with the Bathampton branch, a more direot and, therefore, a diverting line to some extent for pasengers travelling betweeon the west of England and Southampton, who previously passed over the Great Western Railway viU Reading aud Basingstoke, In like manner the Bathampton branch (the con. struction of which ws forced upon the company by speocial clause in the Act of Parliament) has become another line of diversion for cortain trafflic which had previously passed between Bath and Chippenham; so that both have been instrmental in reducing the previous earnnW of the main line. Under such circumstanoes the directors feel that allowance ought to be made for those disadvantages, and they think that the receipts of the last slx months must not be taken as any test or criterion of the future. The increase in the number of persons travelling will no doubt amply compensate in process of time for thosa so diverted. In addition to having opened so many miles of new railway during the winter the directors must not omit to allude to an unusual stagnation of general railway traffic during the last halfyear, observable more or less throughout the oountry, and arising probably in some degree from the peculiar derange. ments of the money-market. Notwithstanding those causes as obviously affecting the revenue of the company, the fol. lowing is an analysisofthecompantivereeptsoverthe Great Western railways between the correspandingperiods of the two yearsn- 1856. 1857. Number of miles of lines opened ... 366 .,. 457 REXEITS TO JUE 30. 1856. 1857. £ £ Passengers, mails, &c .. 417,281 ... 453,157 Goods, minerals, &ac 235.330 258,526 Parcols. 26,293 ; 28,839 Other sources of revenue ... 25,746 .. 28,432 Total ... 704,650 ... 768,954 It is apparent that the working charges of a company under the circumstanoesj adverted to must at first be onerous beyond all ordinary droportion to the receipts, in consequenoe of thegreat additional train mileage over suoh lines and the number of new stations a obe provided with adequate establishments. Coemparng t- e same periods a similar analysis of working charges furnishes the following particulars - ZXPEifSE8 TO JUNx 30. 1 . 1857.

In the half-year to June, 1856, the sum paid out of revenue for interest was 285,8331, whereas it has amounted to 345,28 in the last half-year. This review of the financial business of the half-year clearly shows that while the traffic of new lines of that description will not at first meet the interest upon the capital expended the extra working expenses have in this case been nearly defrayed by the ordinary traffic, even of the least favourable season of the year; which fairly leads to the expectation that the depression in the dividend, however disappointing for the moment, is but a temporary deficiency, to be compensated for out of the progressive earnings of those railways, in addition to that mcrease which accrues from the ordinary business of the other lines belonging to the company. Every effort shaU be made, without involving any considerable outlay of capital, to attain and increase those source of traffio upon which it,is weU lknown that the future prosperity of the undertaling must be mainl based. The Great, Western system, now completed after sucn severe sacrifices made by the ordinaryshareholders, is susmetible, as your directors believe, of the most oertain event improvement; not only will that proportion of new lines now in their infancy (being one-fifth of the whole) expand in due time to a fair amount of mileage recelpts, but fresh traffic will flow in every direction from them over the connecting railways foreconveyanoe to other districts and ports, by means o which the lines previously in operation wil be made gradualy more productlve, and therefore conducive to improving dividends. In Wiltshire, for instance, responsible parties are at the present moment working some rlch iron ores discovered in that county, contiguous to the railway, which ores are now in course of transmission to South Staffordshire and South Wales. They promise, also, an extensive trade in other directions, and espeDiialy if smelting furnaes are erected, as they propose for the manufacture of iron on the spot. They would thereby become freightera upon the railway of considerable supplies of coal, as well as of manufactured iron, in addition to the traffio in the ore itself. The directors are happy to say that they have succeeded in making a contract for the conveyanee of coal in considerable quantities from South Wales over their line, upon the principles prescribed by the board; and some other arrangements of a smilar nature are under discussion. The early completion of the Birkenhead docks underethe provisons of an Act before Parliament in the prosent session may be now regarded as nearly oertain, in which caee a very large accession of traffic may be anticipated with confidence over the northern lines of the Great Western Railway to and from the port of the Mersey. An unintrrupted ommunication with the Continent through ding and Folkestone. by a abort con- neoting link of narrow gauge at Reading, is oalcnuate if the companies work harmonionsly and without undue competition, to secure also a good portion of the trade betwelen the north of England and Franoe .over your lines. Two Bills for that object were introduced into Parlinment during the session-the one by the South-EAstern Company, which was opposed by this company as extremely rejudicial to their rights; and the other by the Staines and Woldngham Ccmpany, to which Tour directors pve their assent upon certain areed conditions A potion of that connecting link wil haveto be carrie Out bY this coinpany, under tke provisions of their Act, in order to preserve a proper control over the taffio. The nul report of the engineer is a pended for the information of the proprietors. Although the Brentford Railway and doeks are under construction by an independent company, without contribution of capita from this company, it cannot be superfluous to advert to that undertaking as one of the greatest importanoe to the G(ret Western interests. It will provide cheap and prompt means of railway conveyanoe for all heavy trio pssing to the river Thames, or destined for the dool kn the ort of London, For ooals and minerals itwll prve invaluable,inssmuchasthewantof arive=whasf yforthe soteamols from South Wales, has een serel felt, and the competition for many other breaches ef trade has been greatly o- stractedbythe absenoeofbetemeanxof ao thoThatues. The arbitration with *he Pesi-offlioe, referred to 1i the last report, was suspended, ter some progrem made in it, by the departure of the ?ost-o8ioo arbitrator for Cnada, and the rel of the Pogtmiater-Ganeral to appoint another, which ha obliged the directors in the interva to rake an eatimate for the nsrvi performed, which han been Included in ihe presnt count.

The report of the directors of this company hu beom Isued It state that the r ffio of the railway e for the hall-year ending the 30th of June last an Increaen one that of the corrwponding kalf.year of 1858 of 45.103.-. namely, in merhandis o435 in m-inerals of 26,5854, in coachingof 8.7681., and in cattle of 1,444Z. The balanoe avaiabeftor dlividend is 255,122, of which 16.0064. Is brought from the previous 'halt-year.

The award of Mr. Gladtone, with respect to the division of traffic for comhe plaeusetween the Midland, the Londlon and Worth. te Mancheter, Sheffield, and Linoobnshire, and Great Northern railway companies, has been reoeived. The state of the fand for the renewal of permanent wa ha been most carefully considered byhe directorswit, a view ton p it on a iore satisfactory hasis. The sum which has of late-yea"r beex taken. from revenue and placed to the credit of this account has been 30.0001. per annum- but the very, large inrease in the traffic of the ompan o t directors to proceed witlx the relaybin o the line much more rapidly than they originlly contemplated, so that the fund waa in debt at the close of the half-year ending the 30th of Tune last to the amount of 109,5444 To pay offt this debt in a reanable time the directors are of opinion that the sun to be set asde from revenue should be 20fandD. per- annum. The great souren of expenditure whtch has arisen in the renewal of the permnent way ha been caused by the rapid displaement of the light rails used in the orlginal construcltion of the grater part of the moih line. This source of expense having now very- much diminished the renewal of the permanent way has aumed a more regular charater, and Ig not likely in future to vary to any considerable extent, asbetwe one year and another. The diretors,therefore,nolongerdeem itnecessary to continue a special fund, except for the p a nt of the debt already incuarred, bat intend to defray the os of renewal with the ordinry maintenance, year by year, as it may arise. The dhiectors have for several years pat set aide 1, . ter annum from revenne as an uramoe funtd against los byfire. They have,however, deemed it theirduitystMlfartber to provideagainsl hoe, and havensredwlthvaro osoffiesa hage amount upon the prlncipal xtationr, workm,&c, of the company.

The revenue acunt for the half-year ending the 30th of June shows that 819,18 had been roeived and 379,2894 expendoed, including 23,093f for rates, taxeso, and Govern nent duty, 15,ODDI. for renewal of permanent way, 6,10re forIncrease of rolling stocb, and 53714 bad debte.

The dirtors feel consderable difficulty in renewing the loans on debentures except at the increased rates of late years, and would suggest the propriety of maiadnga call for the purpose of paying off the amn fall ing due at Martinmas next, thereby dererae the amount of-the debenture debt, the interest on which, i exces of d percoent., accunting for the diminution of the dividend. The directors recommend a dividenxd at the rate of 4is 8d. per sha-re, and 4 per cent, on sums paid in anticipation of calls for the half-year ended the 31st of July last free of income-tax, After some discussion It was agreed that the directors should endeavour to borrow a sum sufficient to meet the payment falling due at Martinmas term, falling which that they should make a call of 14. 17s..6d. per share, The report was APprved, and after a vote of thanks to the chairman the meting separated.

LONDOZ, THURSDAY, AUGUST 13, 1857. In the House of Commons yesterday some time was occupied in considering the Smoke lsuance (Scotland) Abatement Bill as amended, and the additional amendments on the report The House having resolved itself into a commnittee upon the Sale of Obseeno Books &c., Prevention Bill, upon a proposal to exclude Scotland from its operation, MIr. RoEBsxc condemned the measure in strong terms, declaring that a more preposterous Bill had never been sent down from the House of Lords, which, he added, was saying a great deal. A debate ensued, in which the principle and details of the Bill were much discussed, and various amendments were suggested. It was at length agreed that the Bil should be recommitted, and that the debate should until then be suspended. The report of the Committee of Supply was brought up and agreed to, after a long conversation respecting one of the resolutions. On the order for going into a Committee of Ways and Means, MIr. WS, alluding to the rejection the other night of the vote of K0,M001 for the erection of a Ichapel in Paris, inquired what the Government pro- posed to do with reference to the 2,0001. advanced from the Civil Contingencies, and how the money was to be repLaeed in the Exchequer. The CEAizLoR of the ExornEQVi replied that H MER AasTYs Government had come to no decision upon the subject of the chapeL Sir H. WmiLouonny asked whether the Government intended to throw the whole of the expenditure of the large armament destined to the East upon the East India Company, and if so, whether they had formed any notion of the expense. The CHAITOEIoR of the ExcHEQuER replied that it was his intention to give some explanatiou upon that subject in the committee. The House then went into Conlttee of Ways and Means. The 0.uAwcEnoR of the EXCREQUEL, after reminding the committee of the proposal he had made before the dissolution respecting the alteration of the duties upon tea and sugar, and of the effect of that alteration, observed that the proposal he was about to make was substantially the same-namely, to continue the existing duties upou tea and sugar for two years, from the 1st of April next. He referred to returns of the amount of revenme yielded by those two articles, whence it appealed tt the average annual revenue in the two last years was upwards of 10,500,0001. He likewise read returns of the comparative consumDtion of tea and sugar by different classes of society in Englaid, Scotland, and Ireland respectively, which presented some curious results. In reply to the inquiry made by Sir HL WULOuGnrBY-premlising that his proposal would not add anything to the ways and meauns of the current year, merely arresting the fall of dutieshe proceeded to say that it had been the duty of the Government to communicate with the Court of Directors of the East India Company on the subject of their finances, and the latter, being informed that EIR MAI&SrT's Government were ready to consider any representation they might desire to make as to a change in the law regarding their power of bor-. rowing money, or any financial asaistance they might wish to receive from the Government, stated th3at they did not find themselves under the necessity of applying to the Government at present for any financial assistance; that their present meavns were ample in the existing state of the Indian treasury. Han Mijasrr's Government therefore, as at present advised, did not feel caUed upon to submit to Parliament any proposition upon this subject. The ways and means placed at the disposal of the Execative Gorermuent he oonridered amply sufficient to meet the probable wants of the present financial year. If they should have reason to doubt the sufflciency of their means they would not be slow In bringing their position before the House, relying upon the liberality and public spirit of Parliament and the oountry. But threrea lws no immediate necessity for doing so; all accruing demands, including the discharge of 2,000,0001. of Exchequer Bonds and the redemption of the Sound Dues, had been paid out of the resources of the present year. Notwith- standing that these large paymaent had been satisfied out of the growing taxation of the year, It appeared to be adequate to all demands, and Jae did not anticipate at present any deficiency. With regard to the cost of the armament sent to India, as eoon as the regiments were transferred to the servce of the East India Company their expense was charged to the Indian revenue, and ceased to be a charge upon this country. He concluded by moving certain resolutious. After a discussion of some length, wh ch comprehended a variety of topic, the resolutions were agreed to. The Probates and Letters of Administration Bill was read a third time and passed. The Joint Stock Companies Act Amendment Bill passed through committee. The House then went into committee upon the Customs Acts, when certain resolutions were agreed to whereon to found a BilL The Probates and Letters of Administration (Ireland) Bill was comaitted projform. The House adjounied at 6 o'clock.
Te Indian inte31gence is still of that varied character that hs marked each successive arrival. Upon the one point on which public interest has very naturally concentrated itself there is still no decisive result. On the 27th of June Delhi remained in the hands of the mutineers. This, however, only means that during the ten days subsequent to the date of our previous intelligence it had not' been thought prudent to make an attack on the [city. Meanwhile we are informed more particu- larly of the places where the Mutiny had spread. Nine stations are enumerated in Oude, in Delhi, in Bundelcund, and other districts already known to have been infected. Excepting these parti. xculars it cannot be said that anything has been added to our informationto give the Mutiny a more serious character. There has been nothing to call a rising of the population. The Punjab, as well as the Bombay and Madras Presidencies, and Bengal Proper, remained quiet. The communications were not interrupted. Troops despatched from Calcutta were already arriving at the Camp before Delhi, and on the other side reinforcements were arriving from the Punjab. Excepting murdering their officers, firing bungalows, and massacreing women and children, the mutineers had not been able to do anything. They had repeatedly attacked our Camp outside Delhi, and had invariably been repulsed with loss. They had despatched a force against General YAN CORTnMT, coming up from the North-West, with no other result than the loss of 200 killed, besides prisoners, in an engagement near Sirsah. Thus far time seemed to be rathter in our favour than otherwise. Sir EI. BARNARD had collected an army of 7,000 British and 5,000 natives, in whom entire confidence was felt, under the walls of Delhi. On the other hand, the mutineers in that city were overwhelmed with the number of their wounded and with the ravages of cholera. No doubt, reiuforcements were arriving on both sides, but, the insurgents having proved an utter want of the qualities necessary to a successful resistance, we cannot regret that as many as possible should crowd themselves into the place which they have selected as the scene of their own approaching execution. We cannot believe that event to be very distant, unless something unforeseen should occur, or our seven thousand countrymen should be very ill handled. It may seem smaUl comfort to say that we have now seen the worst, when that worst is everything, and has left us no more to suffer. But it certainly is something to fiud that we can lose the entire native army of an immense district, including a population as large as that of France and the Spanish Peninsula, and yet retain our chief military positions, keep our commaunications open, rout the insurgents whenever they venture to come into collision with us, and pursue with despatch the proper measures for suppressing the insurrection. That certainly is a great deal, and it is evidently more than the insurgents reckoned upon. The idea which has possessed the visionary mind of the Brahmin, with more or less intensity, for these fifty years was that the native army had only to throw off its allegiance in some happy moment, and the British authority would vanish and ffit as naturally as the soul on the dissolution of its natural abode. The result is far otherwise. An army of some seventy or eighty thound soldiers, of the most accomplished and ornamental character, has crumbled away, left its camps smoking ruins, its standards bare poles, its officers mutilated corpses, and the cities and country it had protected a scene of lawless devastation. It has then appeared in the form of a hostile army, defending against us the great seat of the old Mahomedan dynasty. So far-that is, as far as weakness and crime could carry out the cherishei dream-it has now come to pass. Bub the Bindoo has failed in his estimate of the British soldier and the men who comjnand him. True, we have indeed been mid, inerciful, and liberal rulers, compared with the Mogul or the Persian; but we can be quite as energetic and firm on an emergency, and this is what we have had to teach the dreamy ! and vapouring native, and are now teaching him. [Lame.7table as this outbreak has been, and fearfal its sacrifice, it has not been for nothing, and the lesson will not be lost on its authors. The native merchants must be supposed very fair judges as to the prospects of the mutiny, in which their interest is the same as ours, only very much greater. The bankers are always the first victims, and, even if they could hope for gentle usage for a time, they know that their prosperity must rise or fall with the British dominion. But at the last date there had been a return of confidence at Calcutta; while, at the other Presidencies, what alarm there had been had now passed away. No doubt at Calcutta the large arrivals of British troops from Pegu and from the intercepted Chinese Expedition had contributed to this sense of security; The first batch of China troops arrived, we are told, about, the 2d of July, and that appears to be about the date of this favourable reaction in the mercantile world. Thus, then. tlhe ChineseExpedition must be regarded as a very fortunate circumistance. It will bring about 5,000 British soldiers to Calcutta, at least two months before they could ot herwise have been expected. If, too, the Brahmins have speculated on finding our hands full with Persia and China, not to speak of our European neighbours, they have only given one more example of the incompetency of Oriental cunning to cope with European vigour and determination, or forestall all the risks to which conspiracy is liable. As things have turned out, we can only say that these very ingenious and secret plotters have chosen a most unfortunate time for the work. Almost any other occasion during the last three years would have found us much less prepared; for we never were so able, and, we may add, so ready, to devote the whole strength of the empire to the suppression of this treacherous revolt.
There are two questions for the Government to consider, of equal importance, though not, perbaps, of equal urgency. The Indian Mutiny mus be suppressed mainly by tho vigour of English troops, bat Colonel SYns is jastified in reminding the flouse that the future maintenance of the Indian Empire depends on the ponsibility of keeping a native army on foot. If Colonel EDWARDrS succeeds in procuring a oontingent from the warlike tribes in the neighbourhood of Pesha- wur he will have done good service, by showing that the principle of English supremacy is still the Same as in the days of CLrvn and of RAssnxos. It would be an idle and useless project to hold India as a conquered territory by means of an irresistible European garrison. It is our boast that we have only taken the place of other alien rilers, and that we have, on the whole, administered the government for the interest of our subjects. It would be absurd to exclude from our service the military population of our dominions, and to allow the native Princes, who collectively maintain an army of 400,000 men, to offer a monopoly of preferment to all the warlike inhabitants of India. The English troops must be regarded as a military police to secure the fidelity of their Eastern comrades, and as an invincible reserve in foreign or internal struggles. The facility of adding to their strength by the rapid transmission of reinforcements from home ought to insure the failure of any attempt against the power of the supreme Government. Three of the speeches delivered in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening were eminently practical and appropriate. Sir Ds Lacy EVANS, instead of Wasting time in dissertations on politics and legislation, examined the details of the arrangements for the despatch of troops, and offered many useful suggestions to the Government. Lord P iSmTON's statement will have been, on the whole, satisfactory to the country, especially when it is remembered that a Minister, in justifying his pas' measures, is not precluded from taking advantage of further information and advice. Lord Jorn RUSSUT,, entering on a somewhat wider field of discussion, took occasion to rebuke the unstatesnanlil;e and uneasonable declamation of orators who would apparently prefer the overthrow of the Government to the suppression of the Mlutiny. Parliament is not to be led awray from the consideration of transports and the recruiting service by flippant denunciations of the permisSion afforded to Hindoo girls of ten or twelve to marry after the death of the husbands to whom they may have been betrothed in their cradles. Armies may mutiny on various pretexts, but no argument except force will persuade them to discontinue their resistance. There is reason to believe that the rebels have already been surprised and alarmed by the discovery that their defection had not left the Government without resources. The despatch of 30,000 men from England will be announced throughout India long before the reinforcements aetually disembark; and in the meantime the Chinese Expedition arriving from Singapore will have supplied the Government with the means of strengthening some of the principal positions. Yet, it must be remembered that a third of the additional troops only represent the ordinary re- 1 liefs, and unfortunately it is necessary to allow a considerable margin for siclness and for death. The Government will act wisely in profiting by some of the suggestions which have been offered for the purpose both of increasing the reinforcements and of shortening the interval of delay. One of the most judicious measurea proposed by Sir DE LaCY EVANs has to a certain extent been anticipated by the orders forwarded to the Governor of the Cape; but it seems quite unnecessary to leave a discretion to a functionary who may be excusably impressed with the paramount importance of the interests committed to his own charge. When every English soldier added to the Indian army is almost invaluable, there can be no sufficient reason for keeping eleven regiments to protect the colonists in South Africa. As General EVANs justly observes, there is no use in avoiding a Caffre war if peace is to be preserved by the maintenance of a force sufficient to cope with the barbarians. It is possible that the Indian mutineers might temporarily hold Bengal and the North-Wesarn Provinces, but there is not the smalleat danger that the Caffres will occupy the colony. The English army in that region has, to a certain extent, always been employed in a philanthropic mission. The home Government has undertaken either to render a frontier war impossible, or to carry it on according to humane and legitimate rules. The colonists are perfectly able, and not altogether unwilling, to protect their farms, their flocks, and herds, if they are alloweed to deal with the savages on aboriginal principles. The worst result which could arise from denuding the province of troops would be that in case of disagreement cattle-lifting and its consequences would be practised on both sides the border. Lord P?A msroN will be quite justified in sending a peremptory order to forward four or five regiments from the Cape to Calcutta without delay. The Mediterranean garrisons may, perhaps, allow of considerable draughts, and this portion of the reinforcements might arrive as soon as the troops now sailing from England, if arrangements can be made for conveying them across the Desert, and for embarling them at Suez. It may be collected from Lord PALMERSTON's language that no political or diplomatic impediment interferes with the use of the shorter route; and an order transmitted by the next mail to Bombay would insure the arrival of transports in the Red Sea within a limited period. The serious objection arising from the summer climate of the RIed Sea wil be removed before it is possible that an embarcation could take place at Malta. The troops would find that any part of India during the More temperate months was more endurable than their present barracks at Floriana in July and August. The difficulty of conveying a force 48 hours' journey across the Desert is a characteristic official obstacle. To avoid the heat of the sun they might travel by night, and there is no reason why infantry should not be moved in preciszly the same manner and by the same means which are adopted by ordinary overland passengers. While the House of Commons is engaged in the patriotic duty of enforcing considerations of this kind on the attention of the Government Mr. Dis&sr, is not ashamed to dilate on all the political difficulties which may be supposed to increase the embaTrassment occasioned by the mutiny of the army. Lord PAsLMrToSN, he complains, has- underrated the danger of India, and over- estimated the friendly disposition of the European Powers. It might be thought that if the complaint was well-founded the Minister's inaccuracy was something more than venial. No patriotic statesman would have gratuitously anticipated unfriendly interference in the Eastern struggle on the part of our actual allies. " If it * is to be an affair of campaigns," says Mr. DisRnarjr, " and you enter on a third campaign, "you will then find other characters on the "stage with whom you will have to contend "besides the Princec of India." Even the Indian Princes have not yet answered the invitation of their self-constituted champion, for the dethroned BnoLIoGAnALus of Oude can Ecarcely be included in the. number of reigning potentates. The anticipation of future hostility on the part of Russia or of France is a far more wanton abuse of an irresponsible position. Lord Joiny iuassmi uses language at the same time more dignified and more prudent when he expresses a hope that no diplomatic squabble may b owed to endanger the traxiquillity of Europe. Foreign Powers are aware that we are engaged in a serious struggle, but, even if they entertained the feelings which Mr. D1SAni gr'atuitously imputes to themn, their Governments are well aware that our national strength is altogether untouched. If India were lost to.rnOrrow7 Elngland Would bo still more than a matehfor'my dingle State in Europe. Mr. DISRAMx's practica advice may be summed up in a few simple propositions. He would proclaim to the Sepoys that their complaints are just, and to thenativeStatesthattheir rightshave been menaced. The Great Powers are to be informed that the Indian empire is in danger, and that we distrust their good faith in times of adversity. Lord CAxmnG is admitted to a contemptuous condonation on the ground of his ignorance of his duties; but all the statesmen who have for 10 years advised the supreme Government-in other words, all those who are specially acquainted with lndian affairs, are to be censured and dismised. Such is the counsel which Parliament receives during a dangerous crisis from the leader of the Opposition. Another supposed candidate for power better understands the way to the* confidence of the country. Lord JoRN Russ=L points out the sources of weakness which affect the mutineers, but at the same time he urges on the Government the duty of putting out the national strength without delay. To others as well as to himself it has been a disappointment that " our mechanical in" ventions, our overland route, and our steam line"of-battle ships do not appear to have added to our means of reaching the scene of revolt." There is no danger that the country or its representatives will be wanting in unanimity or in zeaL The danger to be guarded against consists in professional prejudice and in official pedantry.
One sometimes wishes the House of Commons more discrimination in its economy. There is no telling beforehand what subjects it will select for the exercise of this virtue; the chaaces however are, that something which everybody knows is perfectly useless and costs hundreds of thousands passes unnoticed, while some very modest and very natural claim is pulled about by at least a dozen angry economists, and scolded out of the House. There was the paltry sum of 2,0001. grudged the other evening for the conmnencement of a National Portrait Gallery. Now, it so happens that the wish to know what sort of face such and such a great mran had is just the most primitive and most universal kind of curiosity there is. Nobody can help having it. It is part of human nature. Every one forms some picture or other in his mind of persons whom he reads of in history. We give to ATTrLA, CATO, BRUTUS, BO&DICEA, HiLDEBRAxD, Wr.Lis the CONQUEOB, and GENNGHIS KHAN each of therm aface. The chances are against its being the right face, but a face everybody must have, real or fictitious. " Hoszn, " PLuTA.nc, and NZBuCu"xEzADza," and all the heroes of the Groves of Blarney, are presented with faces out of the large gallery of unclaimedc heads which the imagination hoards or malkes off hand forthe occasion. The curiosity wouldbe extreme were a genuine face of any of these worthies discovered. The art of portrait-painting has, however, now existed for some four centuries, and has handed down real faces to us. Here is a treasury of facts, then, and most interesting ones. The seenes of history are now peopled with real faces instead of sham ones, and we can raise a Cabinet scene of any reign from HINRY VIIL downward upon authentic data. This is a great advance in historical knowledge, to have the real men before us. It sometimes happens that even a single face is a key to a whole epoch. HoLraI's Hmcay VIII. and VANDN:'S CHARIXS I. accompany the reader throughout the great scenes of the Reformation and the Rebellion. We could not understand these two epochs nearly so well without them. But it is not only readers of history who want to see portraits; everybody who reads at all reads what somebody wrote, and would like to see that somebody's face. To the historical portraits there are added the literary ones. But it is of rio use going through aU the different classes of faces, for whom do we not want to see that we ever heard of who was sufficiently great for his existence to have reached us ? This curiosity, as we say, is the most general there is. A National Portrait GaUery, then, is really one of the most natural public wants we have. If we had such a collection we have not the slightest doubt that it would be a great deal better attended than the National Gallery, simply for the reason that it appeals to the most common part of our nature. It does not require a knowledge of art to take interest in such a collection. This is comparatively a rare gift; and, though it is true that a cultivated mind can, vithout any knowledge of art, admire good pictures, it is also true, we believe, that a great many more people pretend to admire good pictures than really care for the". We will not insinuate that cultivated pesrons gape a great deal over good pictures, because that is a matter between themselves and their catalogues, but they find it hard work admiring, and, though exceedingly sedulous in their efforts, seldom attain to the excitement of pleasure. A large class of men of this stamp is to be seen in all galleries, going about book in hand and putting themnselves in earnest relations with large expanses of picture-covered walL We are far from undervaluing this spirit, or wishing to under-estimate the knowledge which these respectful attentions to the arts produce. A little is better than nothing, and sensible men, who do not feign raptures now-a-days, and so convert the whole affair into nonsense, will pick up a sufficient quantum of knowledge to reward their exertions. But the effort which these attentions require shows that the taste for " high art" is not -very commnon as a natural taste, whereas the curiosity to see men's faces, either in actuial nature or on cauvass, is universal, and is one of the most simple and natural desires we have. Even the most uncultivated minds have it. Men eannot, of course, desire to see the faces of persons whom they never heard of, and therefore the range of the curiosity of an uncultivated and untaught person is considerably less than that of a cultivated person. But, with respect to persons whom he does know of, the curiosity of an unculti-rated mind is just as great as that of a eultivated one. The commonest village Methodist would go to see the portraits of JoHx WESLEY and JonN Buxv.x ; the roughest sailor would go to see the portraits of Nansox and CoLLWGWOOD. Our poorer classes may be very igno- rant, but the stock of universally known names is' sufficiently large to give them an interest in a National Portrait Galery. But now cormes the question of room-the place where such a collection is to be put. Mr. BRISCOE not unnaturally complains that he was half an hour trying to find out the residence of the new National Portrait Gallery, which turned out at last to be the house of an engineer in Great George-street, into which, however, even when disoovered, he could not gain admittance, the Gallery being at present, it would seem, rather ashamed of itself, and not anxious for inspection. On this question we reaUy do not seo why lrfr. CoNnwGJH'S suggestion should not be thought of. It is quite absurd to say that we havo no room for suich a collection, when one-half of the building which holds the National Gillery is at our disposal. The Royal Academy ha been allowed, indeed, the use of these roomns a long time, but we are not at all sure that this is an argument why it should. have the use 6d them always. This Society' hi now ourmounxted al} the difficulties of infancy and youth, -and has reached a aucessful maturity. Iti cannot need State patronage anq longer ; it caa stand on its own leg% Wth_ the 'help of any priv'lege. It oould e3-n her pIWc for eXhibiti9g- pictres were it a-0ved of the preoeat one. Why Ahould not, 'the, *h new National Portrait Gillery have these roono t The roomx are national property, and X: AUery is a truly national object. Another benefit will be that, a regular building onc b alotted to the new Gallery, portraits Wi c¢ome there of themselves. Bequest will gradually fill the pla0e, even if the nation does not spend a farthing. bis in a known law. There are mnay pemona who have accidentally come into posssion of one or two good pictures, but, having no collection to leave behind them of their own, choose an exiing public Gallery as the receptacle of their i'sol1ted genm rather than send them abroad into the wi,rld again.
The Dublin jury have come to the eonelgion that upon the evidence presented to th6ni a verdict of " Guilty' could not be found agafint JA=s Sporan- for the murder of MIr. Lrr=T t It would be impossible to say that the evidence was conclusive, and the vGrdict a wrong one. The jury could only take into account the evidqiwe presented to them, for the tetimony which vrould posibly have weighed with conchlive force against the prisoner-namely, that of his wife-was, of courae, excluded from their considers. tion. Still we must remember that this testihnony was not sifted by cros-examination. We may presame that, if admissible, it would have led to. .-the prisoneres condemnation, but it might also have told in his favour. Thus much we have thought it right to say before adverting to the facts as opened in the address of the ILish AronswaGmvxnAL, because it is highly nece3ssry in such a case to distinguish between moral conviction and that degree of certainty which- is requisite for strict legal proof. Now, the real points upon which the counsel for the Cuo.*x relied were that no one in so high a degree; as the prisoner accass at all times to every part of the railway, premises, and, notably, to t)4at portion of them in which the unfortunate fxr. Ixrrrs habitually transacted his businesS, and where he came to so tragical an end. Next, it was proved by the testimony of his own young children that he had given a false account of the manger in which he had spent his evening upon the day of Mr. Lrrmn's murder. His own story waa t'at he had returned home to tea at half-past 5, the real fact being, if the children are to be believed, that he did not then return, but that about 8 o'cloclk some communication took place near ,he smith's house between their mother and fatlier, who did not enter his own house. The children said that they saw their father get a miall ladder, which he ascended. He then mounted the roof of the grease-house; he did soimething at the chimney of the forge, and stuffed something down, it. This is certainly,, a very particular account, perhaps too particular an account of the transaction, and must from that very circumitance excite supicion. It was, to be sure, a bright moonlight night, and the curioiity of the children might have been aroused by the fact that S&OLLE had not returned as usual to his tea; but still [it is strange that two such very young children should have thus collected evidence as well calculated to serve the purposes of the prosecution as though the 'work had been done by an experienced detective officer. No direct evidence was forthcoming to connect SPOIIq with the actual commission of this most heinous and bloody deed. Nobody saw him-if he were, indeed, the murderer-either going to or coming from the scene of the crime; still less did anyr human eye or any human ear mark the actual progress of the crime. We are left--to feel pur way painfully through bits of disjointed circganstantial evidence, which do, no doubt, raise a strong presumption that SPOLLEZ was the murderer; but they are not of so conclusive a character as, to warrant a verdict of " Guilty." The proof having proceeded thus far, that SPo=Bx was well acquainted with the premises; that he gave a false account of himself on the evening of the murder; that he wavs seen by his children to stuff something down the chimney of the forge at about 8 o'clock on the same evening, we must next proceed to draw inferences from the manner in which the packets of money, since discovered, were secreted about the railway premises. We will boldly assume that, whoever might have been the murderer, these various sums were actually the sums abstracted from Mr. Lrmme's room after the murder. The proof upon this point is too conglusive to admit of a shadow of doubt. It follows, then, that the murder was the act of some one or other connected with the railway, for a strauiger would neither have had the knowledge, the power, nor the inclination to avail himself of such means of concealment. The question remains, was SPOLLEN that person ? The money was found rolled up in a cloth, and this cloth actually came from SPOLLEN's house, if the two children are to be believed-we should rather say, if Lucy SPoLLs', his daughter, a child 11 years of age, is worthy of credit. The point was a capital one ia the case for the CROwK, andwe therefore lay much stress upon it. The other child, JOSEPH SPOLLEN, with reference to this matter swore as follows:-" Isaw Lucy nearly three years "ago wearing the sun-bonnet. Iu never used itas a "duster myself, but I know it by the pattern." This clearly was insufficient, and the jury evidently could not make up their minds to hang SroLLxr upon the dubious testimony of so young a child as his daughter. She said, " Upon my " solemu oath, as I expect to be believed, I have " used this piece of calico. I know it by the " pattern. I have no mark upon it. I never " washed it myself, nor do I know that it ever " was washed by any person." A rag of the *sost ordinary pattern and material, used as a duster, was believed by the little girl to be the same which she three years ago had worn in the form of a iunbonnet. The jury might well hesitate before they gave credence to such a tale, the more so. as we should infer from the report which has been forwarded to us that her demeanour was not of that artless and childish description which is calculated to inspire confidence. On the contrary, she seems to have " sworn hard " against her father. " She was throughout calm and self-possessed to an " extraordinary degree, and exhibited in all -her " conduct the possession of intelligeneo far in " advance of her years. From the moment 'she " came upon the table until she left it her eye3 " were studiously averted from the countenance of "the prisoner." Next with regard to the instraments with which the murder must have been committed-a blunt and a sharp instrument, such as a hammer and razor. A haiimer was found in the mud, and 'tt thc. sen of the handle, as it came through the iron head, there was said to be red lead, and upon the handle itself traces of the same pigment, N,or SPorizx was a glazier, and had red leada in his possession, naturally enough. Does it follow that Mr. Lnsrnuwas murdered with that particular bammer, or that it was wielded by SroL to strike thefatal blow, or that the,red fe1 with 'which it is said to have been xmeared came from is workshop?

DEATh or TrnZ RIGHT OIRO. JOHN WLSON rT)KER.-We have received fromt a correspondent an riniouncernent cf the death of the Righat loa. John Wilson Croker, who died at Sir Wihiain Wightman's villa, St. Alban's-bank, Hampton, at 1.0 o'look on Monday night. The right hon. gentleman had been In declining health for Powe months ps8t, and had remnoved from Kensington Palace to Judge Wightmasn's villa within the last week to see if change of air and scene would have an benieficial1 effect on his health. The deceased was son of Mr. John Croker. Surveyor-General of Ireland, and wasbornin December, 1780, in the county of Galwah , Iieland. He was eduacted at Trinity College, Dublin, where he greatly distinguished himself, and in 1802 was called to the IrLh bar. Mr. Croker entered the Rouse of Commons in 1807 for Downpatrick. He sat in eight successive Parliaments, having represented the University of Dublin,Yarmouth,Athlone, andBodmin in the lower house of the Legislature. Mr. Croker retired after the election of 1832, when he sat with the Marquis of Douro (now Duke of WeUington) for the disfranchised borough of Aldborougb, Saffolk. It will be remembered that r. Croker was, from his introduction Into p-ublic life, a great friend of the Duke of York. In 1809 he was appointed Sewretary of the Admiralty, which appoointment he held untlr 1830, having in Jute, 1828, been made a Privy Councillor. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society (1810), D.C.L., LL.D, a Fellow of the Asiatic Society, and of other learned institutions. By his death a pension iof 1,5001. on the consolidated fund ceases, which the right hon. gentleman had enjoyed ever since his retirement from the Admiralty ia 1830. The deceased gentleman married, in 1806, Mie Pennell, daughter of Mr. William Penuel, for many years consul-general at the Brazils, who survives her husband.-Vxpress, Li VXROOa, Aug. 12.-At the Liverpool Sailors Home to-dayaveryfinetelesneopemadebyDollond, of London, was presented by hfr. Graves, ohairman of the Local Board of Trade, in the name of the British Government, to Captain Hodges, of the American ship .E. Z., as a testimony of its appreciation of his condust in rescuing the oaptain and crew of the Enghsh ship Jane Garrow. Mr. Graves stated the facts of the case. In December last the B. Z. fell in with the Jane Garrow in the middle of the Atlantic in a sinldng state, when Captain Hodges took all the crew on board, and treated the crew humanely, sharing the ship's allowance with them, though on arriving at New York the E. Z.'s stock of provisions was nearly exhausted. The owners of the B. Z. subsequently refused to receive any pecuniary compensation from the owners of the Jane Garrow. On these facts being reported to the British Government a magnificent telescope was sent dowvn to the local Board of Trade for presentation to Captaln Hodges, with a puise of 601., to be presented on his return to America to the owners of the ship. Captain Hodges, in briefly replTing, said that, though he felt proud to receive this gratifymg testimonial, he should have felt quite satisfied to have been the means, in the hands of Providence, of rescuing so many fellow-creatures, and he trusted that if ever placed in smilar oircumstances again he might be equally privlUeged.

SECON'.D EDITION. TEXE TIMR&oqI?cj Thursday Monting. THE INDIA MAILS.. We have been favoured with the following telegraphic despatch from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company:- "The Peniusular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's steam-ship Valetta, R. Roberts, Master, with the India and China mails from Alexandia, ar-ived at Marseilles at 8.30 p.m., yesterday (Wednesday). The mails left for London at 10 p.m."
EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Wednesday), o p.m.:- It id stated in official quarters th.t the differeneL in the Moldo-Wallachian question hau been so far settled during the Emperor's sojourn at Osborne as not to require any furtler aotion on the pert of a Conference. A Comiference, in the formalaense of the word, may be unnecessary, but any future difficulty will be settled by the resident Representatives of the Powers who formed part of the Congress that signed the Txeaty of Peace with Russia. The Congress, or_ Conference, is still presumed to be iu le%istence, and wiMl not be dissolved before the final organization of the Principalities. The Representatives of the Powers so nervously alive to the purity of elections in general, who, doubtless on moral grounds, demand the annulling of those of Moldavia, and who, from their demland not being complied with, were preparing to pack up anud leave the Sultana to his fate, bad not quitted Constantinople on Tuesday last. It is presumed, on good grounds, that they have already received tidings of what passed at Osborne, and that they wRilnow remain at their post. Of oorse Lord Stratford de Redoliffe, the bugbearoftheFrench Foreign-office, is an exception. "M. de Redcliffe," as the Ministerial journals term the irascible diplomatist, is to come home on leave of absence-this, on the authority of the Pays. Of X. Thouvenel nothing very particular is said. Despatches have also been received from M. de Bourqueney at Vienna, announcing that Count Buol had intimated that the Austrian Government is at present disposed to an arrangement on the subject of the Moldavian questionL Where all parties are so conciliatory there is no possibility of dispute. "Whon people do agree onthe stage their-unanimity is wonderful." Without being over sensitive, or attaching undueimportauce to what are vulgarly termed "coups d'Tpinls," it would be just as well if the Foreign-ofice gave a elight reprimand to the employes who make up the article for the Constitutionnel. That independent journal says, in its " leader" of to-day, on the settlement of the Moldavian quarrel:- "Ia a cou-try (England) which so highly respects lav and justice, public opinion would not have allowed the (uovernment to act otherwise In a matter of this kind. tobj 1and, moreover, stands too mulch in need of iti wion th France in the East not to make to her ally, in case of need, a concession supported by equity as well as policy." Both England and France would,. I doubt no;t, make concessions, consistent with honour, in order to maintain the alliance which, happily for aU Europe, now exists between them; but the motive hinted at by the person who mined up this day's dose in the Ministerial journal is absurd and unnecessary. You are already informed of the Emperors arival last night at St. Cloud. Previous to hIs departure trom Havre yesterday .morning he h ad conference on board the Reine Hortense, with M. Bonifacioe Comnuissary-General of Marine; M. Bounicean, Engineer of the Works, in the port; and some of the principal authorities on the subject of an entrance towards the north, and the f6rmatlon of alarge maritime establishment on the adjacent ground At a I quarter-past 8 their Majesties landed, and the cort6gc left the Quai Vidocq to proceed to the railway station. It was headed by a detachment of the gendarmery, followed by a guard of honour of mounted citi7ens, organized under the di. rection of MM. Grandin and Caron, alnd a pieket of the Cent Gardes. All the vessels in the docks were| dressed out with flags, and the houses in the streets through which the corfAge pamed were handsomely decorated. The crowd assembled was exceedingly -eat, and their Majesties were greeted with the moet enthusiastic acclamation. At the moment when the Emperor was about to enter a. railway carriage, he turned towards the company present and said:- "Gentlemen,-It was not necessay for me to come to Havre to feel an interest in it; nevertheless, Iam happy in. having visited it a second tlme, in order to receive an account of what has been effected and what remains to be done. You have aaong you all the elements of a great city, and I shall devote my attention to develope them. I have to thank you for the kind reception which yon have given to the Empress and myself; I foel sensibly touched by it, and shall long remember it." This address was received with loud cheersf, in the midst of which the train moved off. The Imperial party arrived at Rouen a little before 11, and proceeded in great state, amid an irunrense crowd and the greatest enthusiasm, to the Prefecture, where a capital breakfast was prepared for them. Their Mlajesties vwent out afterwards to visit some of the principal edifices, and returned to the Prefecture at about 3 o'clock. After a reception of several persons of note their Majesties left by railway for St. Cloud, where they arrived a little after 8, earlier than had been previously arranged. The Emperor has commanded that a painting shall be execunted representinrg his arrival at Osborne on board the Reine Hortense. It is believed that M. Gudin, the eminent marine painter, will be employed on the occasion. Captain Selva, who commands the Reine Hortense, is to be promoted to the rank of post-captain (caPitakne de vaiussau). He commanded the Labrador in the B3lack Sea during the Crimean war, annd is considered one of the best seamen of his class. The following private telegraphic despatch has been received:- " MADRID, AUG. 1l. "ML Lafragua, the Mexican envoy, has made known to the Mexican consul that the Spanish Government has suspended all negotiations with him, and that consequently he has placed the Mexican subjeots in Spain under the protection of France." In the Paris press the paper that discusses Engliah questions with the greatest fairness, temper, and judgment is unquestionably the Republican SiM&le. In its criticisms there is no rancour, no petty spite, and in its censure, when it thinks proper to employ censure, it speaks of England as a great and free nation ought to be spoken of. Our institutions, though monarchical, are discussed by the Republican organ with impartiality. Our prejudices and our faults are tenderly dealt with, and our virtuesfrankly done jutice to. One of the editors of the Sigcle, M.H. LaMArche, whose remarkablearticleson foreign polioyduringtheRussian warweremuch admired, has published a work entitled L'Bhrope et la Russie, in which the excellent qualities I have just alluded to appear in every page.

The French lost Spain beause, instead of liberally paying for all they wanted for consumption, they established that war ought to support war, and thus raised against themselves two srts of interests, and rushed witbout precaution tbrough every sort of obtcle, laughing at their quartermasters, and applying to the word 'administration, an epithet by no means flattering. Norw see the change in human affairs-it Is the English who perish In the Crimea for wnt of a properly organized administration, and it Is the French who resist, thanks to 'the carefulness of their administration, and who fraternally aid their allies." Alluding to the alliance, he says- " When I speak of the English alliance I do not mean simply a Government giving Its hand to a Government. I understand, a people giving its arms to a pcople-a demo. cracy to a democracy. The English democracy hbs not the same forms nor aU the same instincts as ours. It prefers liberty to equality; unity does not appear to it absolutely necessary except in exterior action. The nocessity which the tswo nations experience to agree in their march is the more powerful inasmuch as they proceed to the same goal by different roads. The mistrus which the English alliance iaspired, and which it stll inspires, arises from a perfect anachronism. Old England is dead, and it is she we might still nisAtrust. There have been-no doubt there are, and adways wmll be-certain difficulties in the relxtions existing between these two great nations. But what alliance between equals has ever been vithout difficalties ? The war in the East having to be settled by a continental action, the fist part belonged to France, however great were the Maritime efforts of England. Peace was obtained by a victory in which the English had a fine and noble part, but which, in the eyes of the world, was a French victory. England bore with the exigencies and susceptibilities of Frnce in the exetion of the treaty of the 30th M arch, which France would have shown had the peace been obtained by the capture of Cronstadt, where our army had the part which the English army filled. at akhoff. SusceptibilitIes which would be intolerable in an individual are respectable in a great nation. Let us not be so njust as to complain that the English experience ,sentimnta cwhich we would experience in their place, The Minister who directs the policy of Great Britainsignedthetreatyof the 15th July, 1840. He maintained on the ubject- of the Spanish marriages a polemic which partook of the hatred of ancient times. That was an accident arising fromallinisterhavingllved sufiicientlylongand in a spirit sufficiently progressive to enable him to acknovvledge and repair his ertors. Did not Lord Aberdeen, 4who could not entirely divest himself of the old man, fall from power? We might feel that we had a right not to forget the affair of Egypt, nor that of Pritchard, nor that of the right of search, and we would expect that England should forget that in the year 1852 the idea of an invasion occupied every roindinFranc t Bhouldmalicethereforebe established as a special privilege for our country ? People do not fight zor oven quarr any longer, thank God, except for interests more or less conformable to reason. Well, there are no more interests necessarily hostile between Prance and Eng. lnd. We have no longersany colonies which England can :4nwvy_u excapt. Alger, . hich. we are -too -well Oble'todefend for any body to endeavour to take it from us. England, moreover, has eomsiletely changed her colonil system. All her possessions beyond the seas have obtained free tade, and almost all are invested with the right of self-government under the suzeint6 rather than the sovereignty of the mother country. A new maritime law of nations secures the comumerce of the weak from the attacks of the strongest. The agreement co>eluded on maritIme questions isprepared In the terms Which France never ceased to demard. Is it, then, Onrthe continent that England should cause us uneasiness? We do not believe that England vishes for all that wev vwsh in Germany and in Italy, but she wishes for many tbings there for which we ourselves wish. There is quite sufficient in the ideas common to the two countries to commence a collective workvwhich time alone can finish, for time will not suffer us to do without it in human affairs. The desires of England with respect to Russia or to Poland are quite as advanced as ours. ",An alliance formed on the grounds explained in the pre. ceding summary should not be confounded with those transitory alliances formed for a definite and restricted object and which is dissolved when that object is accomplished. Already during the reign of Louis Philppe Englandshowed Ihrself inclined to such an alliance with France and to all appearance no othe- was then possible. The Governments of the two countrles drewv near each other, but with hesitation, each fearing to say or do something which aight wound the national susceptibility of the other. Between the situation of affairs in 1816 and that produced by the war in the Crimea there is the same diference as bctween the visit to the Chateau d'Eu and the journey of Queen Victoria to Paris -a profound and ineffaceable difference which belongs to events, not to persons."

The fact that the Porte has ordered its Representatives not to quit either of the European Courts with which it is at variance, " unles their pas3port3 are sent to them," must be considered a proof that the Ministers of His Majesty the Sultan still entertain a hope that the difference relative to the Moldavian elections may be asmicably settled. It is here related that Baron Prok-eh "went beyond his in- structions," but the report deservea no credit, for Austrian diplomatic agents never venture to take liberties with their Government. A persoi who must be well inormeed of what has recently occurred at Conatantinople is of opinion that the present crisis woulld not have arisen had the 7Aepresentatives of France, England, and Austr la been somewhat less impetuous and passionate.. - The fat is that the Moldavian election affair is ,-in itself a matter of inferior .importance and it Is probable that the British and Austrian Go- vern, ments will, for the iake of peace, advise the Por .t e to yel.d to the wishes of the French Cabine i.. As tbingsnow stand, thel Fren .are decidedly i' A the right; but if the elections had-taken place fitg-s OrIxI. d4. later they.would b e;.S6bdho just amase to complain of the condlct of the Potte." It n harda be taid that the fo n v8s re,e2.ved neit erfronj.an EighxrE e man, nor trian.- As your correspondent In 'he Danubian 2cisPalities *iWll probably firnisl you with a deta... account of the eledtions in Moldavia, it is 0ax Xv neceasar,y for to Eay that the feeling of the -natiOr1 Was and is. decidedly avere froma the ide' Pft the tuijon. The secrate ditderstanding whioh eidently exists between the Paris and St. Petersburg Go;i?rnmentg alarms the Austrians, and thePresseimplotes Central Europe to be prepared for all contingenciet, ; at it is in considerable danger of being crushed-bstBelr France and Russia." The Austrian Governnart thought it probable that Prussia and Sardinisa wotud instruct their RepreseOtatives atBucharest to protest against the Moldavian elections, but it certainly did not expect that they would go so far as to break off theit diplomatic relations with the Porte. The subjoined passage from the'liNoHhern Bee will sufflice to show that the feeling of Russia towards Austria i6 as rancorous as ever, and that she is intent on saying and doing that which is most displeasing to this Government : The rumour that Count Cavour ha sent to the European Courts i circular relative to-the recent events in Italy is not confirmea. *Vhy shoald the Sardinian Government explain its opiniors And views? Austria, and not Sardinla, ought to apologize for the'excesseS of Mazziui for the Power which has encouraged the Mazzinibts in Italy is alone guilty." The probable sense of ths lt, sentence is that ABtria, 'by injudiciou5 measures, has kept alive the revolutionary spirit In the Italin peninsula. The Imperial Cabinet has recently been negotiating wiith the States lying on the Elbe for the free navigation of that river, and there is some hope that Europe -will be able to get lid of the onerous Stade duties (Sktder ZoU), as it not long since did of those wvhichi were paid at the Sound. Numerous complaints have bee' made to the telegraphoflice at Trieste of the delay in the transmission of the overland mnail to England on the 28th of J uly, The reply given to the private complainants is, that " hardly any of the deapatches could be forwarded until after midnight, because there was a violent thunderstorm." The official despatches were forwarded at half-past 10 a.m., on the 28th, and would probably have reached London in the usual time if the telegraphic communication had not been interrupted in the west of Germany. As Govenment despatches have the right of priority in Austria, it is difficult to believe that any private establishment in England received the news brought by the India mail of the 28th sooner than the gentlemen in DQwning-street. The Oester Zeitung learns from Transylvania that the Magyar race is losing ground in that province. In the circle of Dees alone there are 22 parishes, in whichtheRouman languagehas so entirelysupplanted the Hungarian that all the people attend theRouman (Greek) Church. The only part of Transylvania In which the Mag,yars still hold their own is in the land of the Szeklers. It is related in the Sardinian papers that the roads in the neighbourhood of Milan are infested with robbers, but travellers who have just arrived from Lombardy assure me that they have not heard of any facts tending to confirm the atatement. The Tr%iest. Zeitung learn that M. Cogliati has undertaken to light up the beautiful Cathedral at Milan with " Bengal fire" during 20 minutes on the arrival of the Archduie Ferdinand Maximilian with his bride. Tha Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom will probably quit Trieste for Venico to-day. The Porte has resolved to strengthen the fortilicatIons of Widdin, as it did those of Silistria and Rustchuk during the last winter and spring. The fortifications of Widdin are to be armed with 200 new guns, wich-the wanubian Steam Navigation Company has undertaken to bring from Constantinople. It is credibly related that a further reduction of the Russian army wlvl t;ike place directly after the grand manoeuvres at Kranoe-Szelo. The cavalry regiments have already been considerably reduced, and all the reserves have been dismissed, excepting the cadres of the Fegiments. It is believed that the 3d battalionr of the Guard and Grenadier regiments, and the M and 4th battalions of the regiments of the line will be reduced to skeletons," and the men placed on the reserve list. The Emperor of Russia has sanctioned the plan of General Katenin for establishing a separate staff of 18 persons, whose duty it shaU be to look after the fortresaes which have been recently formed in the steppe " for securing the frontiers aud the great commercial road leading to Central Asia." General Kptenin, as you are probably aware, is Governor-General of Orenburg, andthe suecessor of Count Perowsky. For the furtherance anddevelopment of the tiade with Asia, the Siberan, Orenburg, and Astrachan merchants of the second and third guilds are to have the same privileges as those of the ilrst,-that is, they are to be alloved to do wholesale business. According to the Vienna eorrespondent of the Gazte de Cologne, Her Majesty the Empress is again pregnant, but I have not yet heard from any reliable private authoritY that sach Is really the case. The Emperor is now in Oedenburg, the capital of a Hungarian county of the same name, on the other aide of the Danube. Such great depression prevails in Hungary that His Majesty is not likely to meet with such a good reception as he did three months ago. The Hungarians were over sanguine, and expected concessions from the Emperor which h-e was unable to make. The great inerease in the paper circulation (10,000,000i l. in one month) has produced an unfavourable impression here, and the more so as it is suspected that the note3 were issued to oblige some half-dozen of the leading banking firms. There is such a dearth of hands in Hungary that the labourers who assisted in getting in the harvest earned about 39. a-day and their board. Within the last day or two there have been three or four slight thunder-showers, which have cleared the air and brought the thermometer down to 78. On Friday the lightning struck the house in which Sir H. Seymour liver, at Hitaing, but, fortunately, it did no more harm than to run down the conductor and expend its foroe on a pump. HALF-PASr 5 o'CI.ocx According to an official despatch. the Emrperor reached Oedenburg in the evening of the 8th. The Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian and the Archducess Charlotite arrived at Trieste at 4 in the afternoon of thae 8th. Their Imperial Highnesses visited the famous grotto of Adelsberg whileon their way to Trieste. THE TONrAN ISLANDS.

The differential duties had caused such a perturbation iu the wholesale market that it is difrcult to acertain what was going on, or to estimate present position or future prospects. The local market was extremely languid for manufactured goods. The moneymarket was slightly improved. At Rio the activity in the coffee market remained unabated. From the 9th to the 13th of July 107,500 bags had been sold, chiefly for Europe at' a further enhancement in prices, which latterly hd ruled 200 reis above the iquotations of the 12th of June. The stock was 50,000 bags. Sugar hadbeenI very brisk, and prcehs bad further advanced. Of 1,200 hogsheads arrived from Rio Grande 600 had been sold at 520 rels, leavng in stock 600 of inferior quality. Some sales of Six per Cent.

T17E CLPERY 0N DrVOBoR?. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-So much weiglt is attached tQ the protest of the 9,000 clergymen on the Divoroe Bill, and to their elim not to be compelled to mar divorced persons and thus to violate their consciences, that I venture with much deference to ask you to insrt a short statement of the resons why I believe that this claim Is not founded en reaon, and that it would be mishievous to the tra interesJ of th Church to listen to it. In the frst place, the relation in whieh a clergyan stands to the Yervice which he reads should bearefally bornein mind. His is essentially a "miniserial" office, and by virtue of this office he is pronouncing, not his own private hopes or words or opinions, but the hopes and words and opinions of the Church. The services of the Church are, and must be, addresed to men, xot as they ae, but as they profess to be; in other words, they addre themselves to Christians, and appeal In every instance to the aspirations andfeelings which a Chistian ought to possess, To do otherwise would be, indeed, to lower terribly the sandard of religious truth. Religion and the Church would then not be striving to raise men up to their level, but would be con. tinuaUlysinking to alowerlevelthemselves. When,therefore, a clergyman performs tho marriage service he is not to be understood (God forbid that he ahould be) as thereby implying his own belief that the paties before hin come up to the ideal which is constantly held out in It. The whole language of the service, indeed, is that of prayer for the man and woman, not of confident assurance, so that on this ground alone the objection that we are violating our conscienoes has no weight; but even were it otherwise-were a confident assurance expressed that the man and woman had considered "reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God," the causes for which matrimony wax ordaIned,-sill this would be only, the jstly high languae of the Church of God, which presumes that all who wilingly and fiy wk relfgious sanction and blessing on their marriage do so from a reigious spirit, and not from the merest worldly motives or to make a profane mockery of solemn things There is, indeed, a terrible profanity in the use of a religious service over ungodly and unchrlisan people; but the profauity 1J with those who seek its sanction for their own licentious and impue actions; en them maus rest the blasphemy and the profanity, and not on the Church, which proclaims what a Christn marriage ought to be; nor on the minster who reads in their ears the lofty and pure languge of the Church If I did not beieve this I could never read the buriga service with an easy conscience. If we are to consider it as a " priestly" offlce-if we are in each instance, by the use of a eervioe, to imply our own private opinion that every word in the service applies to those over whom It is used, we should not only be arrogating to ourselves a moat presump. tuous and unchistian office, but I venture to say that it would be impossible, as a general rule, to use the services of the Church at all. Secondly, I maintain that the grieve ancsch as it is, exists already. EvYry country clergyman knows how sadly commonit Is for ,amNS and woman to live together ma nm and wife, and not t01e legally married until the woran Is likely soon to be delivered of a child. Then, from one rea. son or another-partly, perhaps, to avoid the shame, and Ipartly to save the legitmcy of the child-they come to i church to be married. Such cases re of constant, daily re- currence, and what dergyman in such cases ever dreams of refusing to read the service? And yet willany of the 9,OOwho have signed this protest pretend thit the man and woman in such caseshave duly considered that " marxige waa ordained for a remedy against sin, and to avoid fornication," when the woman bears visibly in her body the marks of her sin and fornication before the altar, Surely no greater inoongCity than this can be alleged, even for those who have een divored on the ground of adultery. Lastly, I believe that it wouald be most mischievous to the trme interests of religion that it should be left to individual clergymen to determine whether they should use a servioe or not. Such a course would be the admisson of a. deadly falseaood, for it would imply that the words of the service receive some virtue or validitv from the clergymau who reads them, and not wholly and solely from their intrinsio truth and from the blessing of God. It would not only put us as individuals into a most false and invidious position; it would not only assert a hardship and a violation of conscience to exist, where, in truth, they do not exist, but it would tend, so far as this particular act of legislation went, to be a sna:e and emptation to Us all,-it would encourage us clergymen to look upon ourselves nut as ministrs of God and of the congregation, but as lords and masters over God's heritage, I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

It is stated that MEr. Norman. has not yet obtaned the nesess funds to carry out his object; but it is confidently believed5, notwithstanding that a line of telegraph is to be shorUy laid down between Cagliari and Malta, that ho will receive every support from the East India Company no less than from the mltish Government.

CALIFOBNIA. (FRoM OUR OW!H ODRFY.PONDMMI.) bA . &ANUCO, JULY 4. There is very litte news of interest to oommunicate on this occasion. The prospects of abundant crops are verified by 'the reports coming in from all parts of the country, 'and the parcels of grain of the new crop which have come to market are of good quality. The present state of business is rather unsatisfactory. Vast quantities of merchandise-rice, tea, coffee, wines and liquors, candles, case goods, provisions, and flour-have been sold during the fort. night, but at very low pricos; nor are the prospect i very cheering for the prewent, the demand from the interior being limited, while a large fleet of vessels is becoming due. The last arrival from China brings us dates to the 13th of May, and, although the advicoe show a rise in China produce, the news has not had any perceptible effect upon the market here. There is a slight advance in tea, ba; the scarcity of money among the merchants aild the failure of two of the jobbing houses cheakL bpeculation. The shipments of treasure from San Francisco for the last three months was $13,341,840 23c., which is an increase of $3,000,000 on the previous three months of this year. The total shipment this year from the 1st of January to the end of June wea X $23,638,990 49o. These amounts refute the assertion which was made in the Atlantic States that the yield of gold was decreasing. The value of the exports from this port in the last three months was $1,378,197, which shows an incrse of $170,588 on the pl9ViOuS three months. These exports consisted of barley, hides, horns, wool, and quicksilver. To these will have to be added oats, tallow, mustard-seed (which grows wild in Imen7rse quantity}, whalebon. maxD sil. AnA rrMa other articles be'ng shipped at prSent. Exchange remains wvthout varation. Gold bars are in demand at par of 880 fineness. Dollars are at 12 per cent. premiumn, and always in demand for China. Interest 1I to 2i per cent. per month, according to the security, but very little doing in loanin, chiefly owing to the depresed condition of =reaA tatOe. Mining continues as successful as it ever was. Even quartz mining is looking up, and veins formerly abandoned are worked to advantage. Great intereet continues to be felt in the new nation iroad about tobe contruotedacrotheRocky Mountains. Before it Is finished to the boundary of this State some haf-dozen good roads will be formed to connect with it, and at present there is quite a rage for rnaking excursions acrom the Sierra Nevada to show the practicability of the different routes. We expect great benefts to accrue from the completion of this enterprise, and most persons here look upon It as a sure precursor of the railroad which will connect San Francisco with New York, and of the telegraph which, one may say, will connect the former city with London. The Mormons appear to be in great trouble. Pending the invasion of the United Sttea' forces, 2,000 strong, with which they are threatened, the Cohuila Indims are committing great depredations upon their property, stealing and destroying their cattle and horses, and there is a violent apostacy raging amnong the Saints themselves. The general opinion is that they will emigrate further north and west, and abandon Salt Lake. Young, the leader, had not returned from his tour in search of a new home at the date of ourTlast advices in May. The Chinese immigration has again set in for California now that some of the heavy imposts to. which they were made liable have been removed; 700 arrived the other day, and ten vessels are on the way, bringing several thousanda more. GBold baa recently beeAn discovered inA Mexsico, near Mazatlan; the gold rich, but the diggings not extensive. We have at present a vessel in port with 120 tous of guano on board, brought from an island called Elide, off the coast of Lower California, which is ssd to be of good quality, and to be only part of a very large depoeit. It is to be hoped a plentiful supply Will find its way to England, and have the effect of reducing the price of an article so useful to the farmer. At present the right of appropriation of the guano lism dispute between an American ship captain and a French mereantile house in San Francisco, who both claim to have derived title from Mexico. The last mail brought news of the appointment of MIr. Wiliam Iane Booker as English consul in San Francisco. Ths is a very proper and just appointment. Mr. Booker has discharged the duties of the office (for which he has ample qualifications) for several years as vice-consul, on a very small remuneration, and deserves his promotion to the consulship. Mr. Booker will do Lord Clarendon's appreciation of his merits amplo justice, and his Lordship deserves great credit for having so impartially recognized them. I am very cunfident that I oonvey the sentiments of a large majority of my countrymen in San Francisco in expresing my gratification at this appointment.

THIE KJNGDOM OF THE TWO SIOILrES. (FroM o0R OWN OOR?S?POXmIT.1 NAPLES, Atm. 6. Whatever may be their differences of opinion on many subjects, all persons agree in condemning the prasent system of government in Naples as ruinous and impossible, and look forward to some mode of getting out of this Slough of Despond. Some put their distant hopes in the HTereditary Prince, some in Murat, some in wild and unorganized confusion, and some talk easily and philosophically of material development. These last are fine words, but I find that those who wse them are persons without energy or moral courage, and who thus evade all the rmponsibilities of action by a hrase. What does material development mean in Maples ? Nothing. I shall consider this subject with reference to railways, of which I have had very frequent occasion to speak to you, and shal1 show that in all the many projects that have been set on foot there has been nothing like honesty or earnestness of purpose. In the first place, concessions have been had for the asking. Men of no weight who have made a demand for a concession have been sure to obtain it though on imposible conditions, while men of substance have been set aside, and their offers rejected Even when the concesaions have been granted, every species of indirect oppoxition has been set at work to render them null and void. The hangers-on about the Court have not been interfered with in their intrigues to embarras an unfortunate coreionnaire. Promises made in private have not been observed in public, and the Government-that is, the King, has invariably refused to guarantee any interest on the capital employed. In a country, therefore, which, like Naples, stands alone in the world, capital was not forthcoming. Who would be mad enough to resign a farthing not guaranteed by the Government, and which Government under a thousand pretences may at any hour of the day divert, or appropriate, or misappropriate itt Indeed, so little has been the heartiness or the honesty manifested on the subject of railways, that I am disposed to think that, were a concession asked for one to be constructed over Vesuvius, it would be granted to-morrow morning. When any such shall, however, have boeen constructed, all kinds of impediments exist to its success as a medium of commerce and civilization; so much so, indeed, that I would assert that no railway in the kIngdom of the Two Sidilies can boe a profitable speculation. Perhaps the line from Naples to Castelismare is the most favourable example which can be adduced of successful lines, and yet it has been obliged to borrow money on debentures, and these debentures have been at a discount, though risng now. Are the causes of this of any special character ? I think not. They are such as must impede the success of all railway enterprise in this country. In the first place, no one can go from one province to another without a pass. Imagine the effect of this regulation on a trip from Naples to Regglo, between which two places a railway has been projected, as I mentioned the other day ! How many are the thousands in the course of a year who would be prevented from using it, either from a didike to trouble, or from fear of police Inquiry and persecaution? The Neapolitan loves his dolce far niente, and kn6wa full well that safety depends on his lying hid. His love of locomotion would be suspected, the motives of a visit to Reggio be misinter preted, and the bloodhounds be set upon him. Thiis Is, therefore, one permanent cause to diminish the number of paengers by railway. I wiU instance another, which past experience has shown may be a frequent one. A fever or a plague, or the cholera, is reported, ln the Adriatic or the Levant. God defend us ! The Indian mails have arrived at Brindia or Reggio, the boasted extremities of a line forming part of the shortest route to the East. The pawengers must not land; the cargo is shut upl; and for the time it wil little matter whether there bad been a mule track or a railway to the capitaL Those who know Naples wel know how the absurd sanitary regulations of the oountry are for ever interfering with intercourse even by the ordinary routes. Sometimes, too, it happens that the Government has a political fever, and the usual nostrums aFe applied by cutting off all communication and entire exclusion. Sometimes, too, a special measure may be adopted under some social and moral pretences, which would ruin the line. I allude, for instance, to such a measure as that which prohibited students from coming up to Naples; and which, taking In their friends and acquaintances who might have eome up to visit them, will make, according to a good calculation, a difference of 100,000 persons 'n fhe coursee of the year. Some of the causes which affect the tranit of passengers will affect also the transit of goods, and there are others, too, of a peculiar character, such as the heavy octroi tax at the capital, and other duties; in fact, for a variety of reasons, while the exports of the country are continually increasing the imports are diminishing, and In greater ratiosure signs of the decline of the country. By a measure, too, equally unjust and absurd, the foreign produce which has already paid the duties if it once leaves Naples and is re-introduced is compelled to repeat the payment. What, therefore, are the prospects of successful railway enterpriSe in thekingdomof the Two Sicilies, and who would be so senseless as to risk his capital in a country where an absolute and unscrupulous Government assmes to itself the right of doing according to its own will and pleasure, without so much as consulting those who register its acts ? My position, therefore, is this, that the renovation of this country by its material development is) under existing circumstances, all moonshine. "Material development" is an empty phrase, used by dreamers, or standatiUs, or retrogradists. It is an impossibility in the Two Sicilies, unless other things be first conceded. Mr. Hankey, of the firm of Messrs. Hankey and Co., is now in Naples, with a view to examine into the position and prospects of the Brindisi line. So also is Mr. GTood, of the firm of G}ood, Condor, and Co., which firm is largely mixed up with the Brindisi line. No doubt, one object of these visits is to ascertain the honesty of the Government in its pretences of support to this grand project. Should Mfr. Hankey be satisfied, I have reason to believe that capital will not be wanting to complete the line. Bhe Lac*va Railway was opened to the public last Friday. The Five per Cents. were done at 10I.

IRELAND. I (JBOX oUR OWN OODBAIONDNTl. DUBLIN, WXDNiZSDAY MoRnxg. THE BROADSTONE TRAGEDY. The jury acquitted James Spollen of the ferful crime laid to his charge, so that in all human probability one of the most dreadful murders that has ever stained the criminal courts of any civilized country remainp to be accounted for before that tribunal from which no secrets are hid. The failure of justice in this instanoe was not altogether unexpected, but no one evidently not even the prisoner himself-was prepared for a verdict of clear acquittal; a disagreement of the jury and a secoid trial were looked upon as almost inevitable. But speculation is now at rest for ever as regards the Broadstone mystery, and Mr. Spollen is free to roam the world at his leure. All that could be done was well done by the Crown to satisfy the ends of justice. Subjoined is a condensed report of the final proceedings in Green-street yesterday. Chief Justice Monaghan commenced his charge to the jury, and having recapitulated the circumstance sconnected with the murder of Ir. Jittle, and having commented at great length upon the fact and evidence adduced at the inquest, proceeded as follow:- "The next matter that occurred after the commission of the murder was this, that a seah wss made In the canal;in the hope of discovering the instrments by which the mirder was committed, and also to look for the ke of his offil although I do not see of what value it wonid have been, because it was clear that It mtut have been tken say by the murderer. But, at all event, It does appear that on that occasion, and some days after the perpetration "of this mnurder, two instruments were found-one a la*e hammer, and the other a razor. It appears that upon that occaaiontheoanalwas drained, and, a well as we can gat4"r fromthe eidence, the hammerthatI now holdin myhand Wa found ithe nrrouwpartofthe cansrtherinchningtowad the basin; and it appears that the razor, which I also hold in my hand, was found more in the narrow part of tfie canal; and no doubt it was immediately suproed, gai one would have thought, not without aome founation, this was the hammer and that was the razor with which the wounds were inflicted. It appeared from the evidence of a medical witness, Dr. Porter, that he fitted the hammer iuto the wounds on the head, and that they did tally. There is no doubt that any otber hammer of the same size would have talied exactly, and therefore it merely creates a suspicion that this was the hammer with which the wounds were inflicted. The only sugestion made for the purpose of connecting Spollen with this hamnrer is th, and I may here anticipate to a certain extent the evidenoe of his son Joseph. He states that this other hammer which I hold in my hand w his father's, and that after the murder its appearance was not the same as It is now-that it had more the appearance of the other hammers. He states that this hammer w in and about the old workshop attached to his father's cottage, at or about the time of the commission of the murder, and that about tbat time he missed the hammer, and that he did uot see it until it was produod to him by the polioe. He says that he knows it to be his father's hammer, notwithstanding the alteration of the puttying now apparent on it. This witness also statee that, in addition to this hammer, hia father had an old hammer which he kept in his paint shop In the other portion of the building, near the locomotive dpartment The suggestion is, that it was his own hammer committed the murder, and that being so, that, in order to replace it, and that he might have a hammer at the workshop, he brought from his oqt. tage this old hammer which had boen laid by for a oonsiderable time. No doubt, if the other evidenoe in the ease satisfies you of the guilt of the prisoner, that suggestion would not be inconsistent with probability, but as yet it is mere conjecture, for the boy who identifies the old hammer does not profess to identify the other one; on the contrary, he looks on the hammer a3 a strange one. [The Chief Justice then entered into a searching analysis of the evidence, and proceeded,-] It is for you altogether, when you consider the evidence, to judge of all these facts-to judge of the possibility of this being what Mr. Brewster called the result of the artless ignorance of the children deposing to certain faots occurring on that day which may have taken plece on any other day. Now, the evidence which has been piven, and which you are bound to act upon if you tbink it faithworthy, is that produced and givenbeforeyot here; butitis perfectlyproperandlegitimate to cross-examine a witnem before you as to what he or she may have sworn about the same occurrence on a previous occasion. This has been done before you, gentlemen, in thls case, and it is for you te ay whether there is a substantial discrepancy at all, and, if so, whether it is such as to lead you to throw aside altogether the evidenoe -a unworthy of belief. I shall call your attention to these discrepandes. In the first information of Lucy Spollen, taken on the 25th of June last, she makes no mention at all about the circumstance of seeing her father on the forge roof. She speaks as to the sun-bonnet or duster, and states she had seen it on the day of the murder, or the day before, and had not seen It after that til the day of her examination. From the nature of the case we cannot receive as evidenoe what pased between this child andhernmother, but we know that at the time of the swearing of this information that was aU she stated to the Crown authorities; for if more had been communicated by her to them is would, doubtless, have appeared in those informations. But the material part of her evidenoe of the 25th of June is that she identifies the rag, and states she saw it the day or the day before the murder. In her evidence here she states that she recollects she saw it there three months before the murder, and not after that tlU the polUe office examination. She was very cloedy examined as8o this difference, and certainly gave no explanation of the discrepancy. This was, prohahly, owing to the age of the child. At all events, she identified the cloth then. There is no doubt that Jolia Lyons would be a perfectlycompetent witness for the Crown if they thought fit to corroborate Lul's evidence as to the bonnet, and for the prisoner if she could prove thtt she never made such a preeent at all to the child, or, if she ever did, that this piece produood is not it. Either party might have produced her here; but, however, we are left in ignorance of what her evidence r. ht have been, and we can only deal with the evidence bfore von We then come to the second Informations of this girl, given by question anld answer in the police-office. Mr. Pemberton and the magistrate each took notes of the substanoe of the evidence, and prepared the informations, which were afterwards read to and signed by the witness. Well, In that examination she states thbt she saw him put a ladder up to the roof near the cottage where she lived. Now, here Is the first contradiction, because in her evidence she stated that the first time she saw him he was on the ladder. She states then that after that she saw her father home at tea, and that she never wore the sun-bonnet, but frequently used it as a duster. As to the direction which she says her father gave her as to stating she knew nothing of the chamois if asked by the polce sbout it. EHis Lordship then prcseeded to read the second information of Lucy Spollen, and continued,-] Such is her information. I read before the evidence she gave here, and it has been observed that there are several discrepanmes betveen the two. No doubt, there are such discrepancies, not only as to the time of seeing the rag, but as to the pulling up of the ladder to the roof, and as to the partiular position in which she saw him on the roof or on the ladder. But the matter in which they agree is this,-that whether he drew up the ladder or not, or whether she saw him put it against the cottage or not, she saw him on the roof at the chimney, apparently putting somethinginto it. Counsel forthe Crowncontend that that is the circumstance which would be likely to make an impression on a child's mind, and that the particular mode of his getting on the roof, or circumstances of that kind, would not be so likely to do so. In her information she stated that two days after she asked her mother what her father was putting in the chimney, and that she would not tell her; but of course that is not evidence here; and as to the imporhnt portion of her evidence the Crown contend that there is no contradiction, and that of the fact of her having seen the duster there is no doubt. On the other hand, it is said that these differences are such as would not have occurred in the evidence of a truth-telling wltness, and that you should come to the conclusion that the entire story is the result of fabrication. Of course, gentlemen, if such be your opinion you will reject all thathe girl said. Bat, on the other hand, before you come to that oonclusion you will remember that the child said that Joseph and James Spollen were both present and witnessed the scene on the roof, and that her brother James is not produied, although he is the peronsaidby the prisonerto havebeen with him from half-pst 6'cboox oft tat day, and to have gone in the evening, with himself aad his wife, to buy bacon. "The Foreman-Whosc duty, may Lord, was it to produce James Spollen ? "Chief Justice ooNAnAN.-As to that there wasno obligation on either side to do so. The law is that there is an obligation on the Crown to bring forward such witnesses as they think right, with this exception, that it is the duty of the Crown only to bring forward every witness that they think will depose truly. "Mr. CuRAN.-There is no evidence, my Lord, that James Spollen was not trustworthy. "' Chief Justice MosAn&N.-There is no evidenoas to him one way or the other-whether he was communicated with or made an information. There was some ittle evidence given in the case, whihc as I did not think it was properly adminsible, I willd not refer to It. (After a coDmmunication with the Lord Chief Justic -My L ord Chief Justic says, and i agre with him, that there is no evidence that James Spollen was faithworthy. There is no evidence in the cas about him, and all I wil say of him is that either party might have produced him if in their judgment they thought right to o so. The next witness was Joseph Spollen, and his iisformaLtion, made in the police-office, was as follows : His Lordship read the first information, and also the evidence ieven on the trial, by Joseph Spollen, at length, and contiuedJ-There is a contradiction in this testimony als. The boy saidl here he saw his father crossing thie lisne at about half-past 5 o'clock, and in the information he says that he did not see him from dinner hour until he was on the roof. Now, I will read for you the seoond information made by Joseph Spollen. (The judge then read his notes of Joseph's evidence in detail, and th informations afterwards taken, in the me way as his sister's, before the police magistrates ; then driw attention to the contradictions prceptible between the two socounts as to the various times he saw his faher onL the eveinng of the m urdr er, and as to being at sbhool on the day of the murder.) He then contfaud-It is uecessary, gentlemen, to refer to the eviden of any of the witmne who have deposed to the semarcing for the mosby. The only witnewe I wfil refer to is the one who provedi the arrest of the prisoner and who searched blzgi affer the arrest, and found upon him two keys, one of whish the prisoner told Itim was the key of his own private drawer ; and this witnes tells you that the prlsoner~ d to him when he ookthekeytht te plicmanorthe authorities had no rghtto penhis rawr o totake the key from him Th oter eywasthekeyofhis work plaep, en ther isno eidece bouttha.

SUMMER ASSZES. XTh^Df1st7s:.wS TWm TTVVRRPnAT. A-n 11 Mi. BarorWatson sat for the trial of prisoners here i yestcrday at 12 o'clock. r. Baron Channell did ot;b arrive in Liverpool, from Lancaster, till late last night The criminal calendar here is unusually heavy, as indeed it was in the northern part of this conty, at lancaster. I This has not been the cas in the other coqnties on this Cirtuit;; in several of them the calendars having been unusually i3ght. In charging tho grand jury yestorday at Liverpool r Baron WATsoN thus spoke of the state of crime in thia coumty:-L am compelled to make the same observation to you as I hbd to make to the grand jur of the northern division of this county with revct to the calendar. It shows a mont unsatisfactory state of morals asnong some olases of persons in this county. The alendar consists of 165 prisoners, and that does not include any of those who are ordi. narily tried at the quter sessions throughont the county and throughout the boroughs. This is merely the accumula. tion of crime during four months of the year, amd those four months in which the least crime it usually committe, It is also to be observed that in this great and populous county trade is in a state of prosperity, and one would suppose that there was plenty o occupation for the people. When I say that the caleadar is in an unatifdac. tory state, I mean thxat the number of persons charged is great and the crimes are extremely bad. I wil give you a short summary of the cimes that are to be brought before your investigation, in the first instance, at these assises. heeo are 1a persons charged with murder. There are 20 persons charged with stabbin= wounding, and shooting with ntent to do grievous bodilyarm. There ae 18 cases of manslaughter; there are 11 cases of rape and attempts to commit rape; of forgery there are eight; of highway rob. bery, 30; and of burglary, 33; and other offences such as perjury, six; bigay, six; and various other offences of a descrption which are calculated to reate in many persons considerable alarm. But I think, gentlemen, we must not refer to the demoralized state of the whole county crimes lie thes They arise from a lower class of the p,ople, who wil always accumulate where the population is in great nmasse; where you have largo towns like Liver. 1 auhwster, and other plac of the sort, you will d, while he morals of the great mass of the people are In a healthy state, classes of the comr,munity committinz the most grievous and deplorable offences. Gentlemen, believe that great efforte have been made throughout this country to begin at the beginning with the people-that is, with education. I know no means whatsoever to stem the torrent of crime which seems to be setting in upon the country at large bu^t by begining at the beginning, aud vinag wholesome eduation. Yua will turn many away trom a life of idleness and crime to ono of honesty and industry; and I only mention this to you because I know you are perfectly awake to this subject, and convinced that education is the only means by which we can hope, while wealth and population increases, that crime will not increase also. Education, gentlemen, will meet many caesr,-there are some it will not meet. It will not meet the case of the adult population who incline to crime. It will not meet the ease of the children of the utterly depraved. It will not, again, meet those who come into the large towns within this county for the purpose of perpetrating crime, and for the purpose of deliquency. The ltter are only to be met by an active, vigilant, aud intelligent police. Gentle. men, I t'vst that as the time goes on, the younger classes of the community will be awakened, and brought to a sense of the great principle that the7 can never deviate from the line of honesty n industry without bringing themselves and all connected with them to shame. The cause list contains an entry of 104 causes, 36 of which are in the Manchester and Sora list; the residue In the West Derby and Liver'pool list. About 50 of the latter are foreign causes, chiefly from London, owing to Liverpool being the last assize town. CROWN' COURT.-(BeforC Mr. Baron WATsow.) Samuel Jenkinson was indicted for having at Constanti. nople on board theBritish Halifax. on the 22d of March last, feloniously cut, stabb, and wounded John Brady with intent to do him grievous bodily harm. Mr. Warren, Q.C., and Mr. Aspinall appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Brett for the prisoner. In this case the prisoner, who was a seamnan, was indicted for stbbing the mate of his ship at Constantinople with intent to do him grievous bodily harm. The prosecution had been directed by the Board of Trade. For the pzoseution were called the mate, the master, and two of the crew of the ship Hlifax, who stated that on Sundae, the 22d of March, the ship was at anchor in the BosphernF; that the prisoner in the early part of the day had quarelled with the mate and bitten his cheek and finger; that between 8 and 9 o'clock at night the mate, notwithstanding the renonstrance of the captain, went to the prisoner and said, 'You unmanly blaguard, you bit me this morning; I should like you to stand before me now, and let us see which is the better man ;" that the captain got between them to separate them; that they closed together and that the maate immediately fell baek, being wounded in three places, one being a dangerous stab in the belly. The prisoner usually wore a knife n a sheath at his w AU A Sicilian sailor was also called, who said that in the early part of the day the pisoner had threatened to stab the mnate in the belly. For the defence it was elicted that the prisoner, when challenged by the mate, refusedi to fight, and that he wvas not seen to lift his hand, nor indeed was any knife seen by any of the witnesses. wa Mr. BRErr, for the prisoner, contended that he might have had the knfte innocently in his hand, and that the mate was accidentally wounded in rushing towards the prisoner. The jury found the prisoner GuilUy, and The leared JuDGZ sentenaced him to penal servitude for AuGusT 12. Crvm COURT.-(Before Mr. Baeron CARN-LL.) CLADM AGANST A RAILWAY COMPANY. nxaiizjV-s V. TIrr EAST LANCASHIRE RAILWAY COatIANZY. The plaintiff in this case is Lawrence Hargreaves, an overlooker of power looms; the defendants are the East Lancashire hallway Company; aud the action was brought to recover compensation for personal injury which the plaintiff had sustained owing to the alleged negligence of the defendants' servants. The defendants pleaded that the plaintiff had agreed to aecept 4O in satlfaction of all claim he had against them fior the injuries he had received. The plaintiff replied that his signature was obtained to the agreement by fraud, and when he was tnastate of insensibility and unconscious of it contents. Mr. Monck, Q.C., and Mr. Wheeler appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Atherton, Q.C., and Air. Segar for the defenidants. It appeared that the plaintiff was a young man who had held his situation of overlooker of power looms in a factory for several years, and on the 4th of Aupust, 1856, he was a passonger upon the East Lancashire Railway to Heywood-bridge station, some distance from Bury. When t"e train arrived at this station upon the occasion in question the engine ran off the rails, the carriages were turned over, and the plaintiff was struck in the first instance against the top of the carziase, by which his head was severely Injured, besides which he was cut in various places, and rendered to a considerable degree insensible. When the poor feUow firt became consaious he found himself lying some distance upon an embanluenttof the line of railway, with hisleg_doubled under him, and he was suffering very great pain. Be called out for help, and at length somebody did come to assist him and he was placed in a room along with another sufferer. A medical man having arrived, he examined the plaintiff, and found that his thigh was broken, but owing to the great swelling which hiadtaken place the limb was not set until the following day. The unfortunate man a day or two afterwards was discovered to have received a severe cut on the other leg also, and the medical man employed by the railway company was heard to exclaim that be had had a very narrow escape of that leg being broken too. After remaining here in great pain about three weeks he was removed to his own house ; but he had never yet re-o-vered the use Of his limbs, and it was the opinioni of the medical men that he would rem ain a criPPIe to the end of his days. He was compelled to have recouxrseto the use ot a crutch, and would always bave to do so, because one leg was about 2i inches shorter than the other. It appeared that shortly after the acoidetit Dr. Harrison, the medical man of the railwa company, who in the first instance attended the plaintiff brought a paper to the plaintiff and his friends, telling them be was goig to give them 401. and pay the doctor and that he wanted them to sign the paper. H then put pen into the hands of the plaintiff, who was still in a stte of insensibility, and moved the pen and the plaintiff's hand for the purpose of making a mark across the paper, after which he lest, saying, "That will do." A few minutes after. wads he returned and gave them a check for 401., for which they got the money at the Bury bank on the following day The plaintiff had not yet been able to resume his worwo though, when getting the paper signed, Dr. Harrison told them that he could be taken home in three weeks, and would perfecly recover in 16 or 17 weeks. Mr. Franklin, surgeon of Manchester, deposed to an examinatiou of the Plainqtiff about a month lago, and to the serious character of the injuries which be bad received. He said there was a disproportion of upwards of 2A inches in the length of the legs; but the fractured part had now become firmly united, and ihe evil was therefore permanent it being utterly impossible to restore the leg to its original length. There were a n,umber of other injuries which the man lied ustained, and there was now a swellng of tho gslands.

Mr. A3andMtroi, for the defence, contended that at a time when the plaintiff was fully concious of what Wa going or and knew everqthing that was passing as wone as ae didto-day in the witness-box, and at a time when the medical men themselves took a favourable view of the case and did not anticipate any very serious oonsequences, Dr. harrison made the offer of 401. as comruensation for the injuries; and alter, at the request of Dr. Harrison himaelf, consulting his wife and brother the plaintif did acoede to thedoier, mand the paper was opeall igned, though in the f atree f thin g it was quite posd b le Dr Harriso might bave assistd in guidingthe pen.

C oWN COUlRT.-(Before Mr. Baron WxTso.) James Purvis, aged 40, a lettercarrier, was indicted for having, on the 17th of June last, feloniously stolen a letter pntainng one sovereign, the property of the PostmasterGeneraI,, at Liverpool. Mr. Attorney.eneral Blits, Q.C., and Mr. Cross appeared for the prosection, nd r. B ssheton Cros for the defence. The first witnae called wsi detective-officer Cousins, who sid that on the 17th of June he marked a sovereign, Vhich he put into a letter directed to " liss Mary Lawson, at Mrs. Holmes's, 31, Feenche-street, Liverpool." Such letters are called "blind" letters, vhen they are thus mis. directed. Witness wa aftrwards in the Post-office, and saw the prisoners with a tray of letters, samong which wvo the one he had made up. The prisoner's round included Finch-street. He observed the prisoner take up the letter, feel it, and place it among the letters he had to tkke out. He saw the prisoner start on his rounds, and watched him go pat 31, Finch-street. He looked up at the house, but did not call there. The prisoner finished his rounds, and went home to his dinner, at 88, Brunswick-road Witness followed him, and having obtained admisdon sarhed him. He fotud the sovereign in his waistcoat pocket, but found no trace of the letter what. over. Prisoner told bim that he had recved the sovereign on the previous Saturday from the Inspector at the poet. office in his wages. He also found in his purse two halfsovereigns and some slver. There was a fire in the room where he found the prisoners uniform. Thomas Hunter, a clerk In the post-office, dwated that he saw Cousins mark the sovereign and pat it into the letter. He was watching with Cousins, and saw the prisoner select the letter from the tray. It was customaary to paw the " blind" or imperfectly addrested letters from one carrier to another in order that they might each see if there was any one likely to be in their round. Mr. Dean, the inspector who paidthe prisoner, deposed that on the previous Saturday ha paid him two half-soverigns and a shilling. He was positive he did not pay hir a sovereign. In defence great stress was laid upon the fact that no letter had been found in the prisoner's ossewion, and it was argued tht the witnesses might be mistaen s to the identity of ihe sovereign. His LoRDsisP summed up the evidence with much care, and, after a consultation of a few minutes, The jury returned a verdict of Guilty. is LORDIMp, in passing sentence, dwelt upon the necessity there was of severely punishing all such cases as the present, in order to protect the constantly-increasing correspondence wbich passed the post-office. The sentence was tnat the prisoner he condemned to four year penal servitude.

WVILLLAS V. DE VILBRAY. This Case ws disposed of late on Tuesday evening. It was an action brought by the administratrim and representative of the firm of Williams and Sowerby, silk mercer &o., of Oxford-street, to recover 521. for sik dresses and other goods supplied to the defendant. The pleas put upon the record in answer to the plaintis claim admitted the receipt of the goods, but alleged that they were sold for an immoral purpose,-namdy, to enable the defendant to carry on the ocoupation of a prostitute. Mr. Peteredorff was for the plaintiff; and Serjeant Parry and Mr, Joyce for the defendant. Tne issne being upon the defendant, Alga de Vilbray, the defendant, a taL elegantly dressed Frenchwoman, was examined, and she stated tha' she had been In the habit of purchasing articles of dress at the establishment of the plantM and always paid ready money for them. Upon one occasion, however, she saw Mr. Grant the manager of the establishment, and he inquired whether she was not a gay woman, and she told him she wasand he then said that he thought she might get more friends if she dressed more expensively, and that she might have anything she required upon credit. He showed her somne exponsive dresses, and said that she would look like a quen i them, and at the same time told her that she shoild go to the Argyll-rooms and other places of a similar kind, and she woula easily find a friend who would pythe bill She stated that it was solely in consequence of this that she ws induced to purchase the dresses, and sbe afterwards woroe them in the pursuit of her vocation. The defendant was cross-examined at some length by the learned counsel for the plinti, but nothing was elicited from her that at all tended to shake her testimony, and she persisted in declaring that the plaintiff's manager was per. feetly well aware of her Position at the time the goods were suppled, and that he induced her to purchase them under the circumstances she stated. Mr. PtmirsDOnFr then addressed the iury for the defendant, and he called Mr. Grant, the person referred to by the defendant, who stated that she was introduced to him by a Frenchman named Dorbas, who re resented that she was a respectable married lady, and thather husband was abroad, and would not returnfor afortnight, and that the arrangement wa that half of the amoant o the goods supplied was to be paId down, and the remainder when the husband returned. He stated that after the goods had been sent in an excuse ws made for not paying what was agreed upon, and suibse. quently it appeared that the defendant never intended to pay, and therefore the present action was brought agulnst her. He also positively declared that he had never made the suggestion she represented to her. Mr. Justice Wrwes explained to the jury the law in reference to a case of this description, and said that if they believed the evidence of the defendant she was entitled to a verdict, and the only question for them was which of the witnesses they considered entitled to credit. The jury. after a short deliberation, returned a verdict for the defendant.

CP.ZiWAL COuT.-(Before Mr. Baron BRusrwxr.) Ann Bird was charged with wilful and corrupt perjury at Cheltenham. Mr. Fallon appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Sawyer defended the prisoner. It appeared the prisoner, who was servant to Mrs Colonel Gordon, living in Lansdown.terrace, Cheltenham, had laid an information againsrt a Mir Charles Neale, a printer, for a brglary and robbery comnitted in the house of her mistress on the morning of Friday, the 24th of April.

This evidence was confirmedby Wallaoe and by Mrs. Neale; and his little gid said ahe went into his room a little before 6 in the morning to get some matches to light the fire, and Uaw, him in bed, where ke remained till 8 o'clock. A man named Brewer said he was at work at the back of Mr. Gordon's house on the morning in question, and if anybody had got over the wall he must have seen him. A policeman named Sheen said he had examined the premises, but there was no Ippearance of any breaking or forcible entry, but a man maigt have got In at an unfastened window at the back of the house, but this window was 12 feet from the ground. A good many things were scattered about the place, and the sum of 5h had been taken from the box of a French servant. Mfr.

Mary Browning, who had been convicted of the manslaughter of the Illegitimate child of her daughter, was brought into court, and Mr. Baron BRMwr sentenced her to be imprisoned for one year. It wa sted to the Court that the prisoner bad been cartified to be of unound mind, and that she would be r moved to a lunatic ayhyn. John Townsend and Willim Holland, two ewr ts of the Gena Ween ilway Compay, Were aged with stealing seven bottles of wine, the property of lfess. Wheeler and Co. Mr. Crips and Mr. Gilmore Evans appeared for the prom secution; xr Powell defended the prisoner. It appeared the Mesers. Wheeler and Co., wine-mer. -chantsad caused a hamper of wine to be delivered at the Great WeaternRailway sation at Glooester, to be forwarded to their correspondents at Bwnusea. This hamper was safely received in a lugpge truck at the inwards goods saltion to the knowledge of the prisonersi who were porters of the company, and the hamper remaned safe in that truck till half-pst 10 at night at lesat. Between 10 and U o'clook, on the arrival of the Hereford train, goods van No. 261, which came with that train, was shunted near to the luggap trok in whichthe hamper was. Shortly afterwards the prisorer Townsend engaged Byett, the night policeman, in conversation in a place from which the tck and van could not be seen, and at the same time the other prisoner wa seen close to them by a porter who chanced so come down to the goods station. Byett observing the prisoners to hang about the place, andthiuldng something w wrong, went down to the van; and when he got ner to It he saw Townsend come out and Holland go in, and then heard the clashingof bottles, andthe dropofthe lidofalocker. On asldig what was up, it was answered to Byett that they had a oonple of women in the van. They further refused to let Byett have their light to see whether ell was right, and reused to let him go into the van. Byett kept watch over the own, tlll, after many various attempts to Induce im to leave, the prisoners departed. Hethen went into the van, and feeling about observed some bottls Byett communcating these facts to the superintendent, a aroh was made, and Bix bottles of wine were discovered In the van, and it was found that the door of the truck haa been raised, the hamper broken open, and seven bottles abstracted. It was further shown that the prisoners' duty was to shunt trucksl, and could cause them to beat offlces situated at some considerable distance from the truck and va It was elicted on cross-examination that the shunter's duty was to look into the van before passng it down to the goods statioa, but that this duty should be verformedat a spot far removed thence, and whence the trkis ran dewn an incline cfthemselves to the goods station. In addition, it appeared that rmore laboure6 were at the pamengera' station a little wa' off. Mr PoWRu. having addressed the jury for the prisoners, Mr. Baron BRAXwELL sunmed up the evidenoe.

AUGJUST Z2. (Before Mr. Baron MArnw and SpeciaZ Juries.) YAPP AND OTHERS V. BOYE& Mr. Serjoant Pigott, Mr. Huddleston, Q.C and Mr Phipsonappeared for the plaintiffs; and Mr. 'ihteley, Q. , mr. Skinner, QmC, and Mr. Gray for the defendant. This was a action of ejewtment brought to recover poes sesson of a farm and premises called " The College Fa!mhouse," situate at Asoott, in the county of Oxford, formerly the prop of Peter Harris, who died on the 23d of June, 1856. she plaintiffs were George and Peter Samuel Yapp, two sonsof o r. Yapp, a shoemaker, in Sloane-street, London, who had married Mary, eldest daughter of Peter Harris. The defendant . b. Boyes was the husband of Bsther, a younger daughter of Peter Harris, It appeared thatold Peter Harris lived to a t age, uP. wards of 80, and at different times he had made various wills making varloua dispostions of his property among the several members of his family. The plaintif= claimed under a will made in the year 1854, when the decesed ws nearly 80 years of age, but, according to the plaintiffse evi. denoe, he was at that time in a Perfectly sound and di&. podng sate of mind. Another will was nmae In 1855, and a third on the 14th of February, 1856. The defendant claimed under this latter will, and, according to the plaintiV evidence, the testator's faculties had by that time come clouded by extreme old age, so as to render him totaly incapableBof dealing with his property governes wiessces were examined on har of the de sfendant to shov that when the deceased mde his lst rill, In 1830, he wvas in the full enjoyment oF his faculties, audi] [ Saed hatit very nearly corresponded In terms wFith the Mrs. Boyc, the defiendant's wife, who had formerly been governess in Lord Cottenbans family, and had made the wivlls of 1855 and 1856, was briefly examined this mornig, but before her examination had prooeeded far The jury interposed, and sald they were quite satisfied to find their -verdict for the defendant; and they askedwhether it was necessary for thea to hear more. Mr. Baron M ¶TrN expreswd himself of the same opinion, and thought It would be better that the trial should stop here, as it would obviate the necessity of eraum ining rs Bowes upson matters of a painfu1 ntature in reference to the testator's change of intention. This suggestsion ws adopted, ard the jury thereupon found their verdict for the defendant, RUCK v. \vThLrAaS. Mr. Huddleston, Q,C., and Mr. Powell appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serijant Pigott and Mr. Gray for the defendant. The pintiff in this action, Mr. Ruck, was the ocapier of the Montpelier Baths at Cheltenham, and he suedMthe defendant, G. B. Wlliams, the clerk to the Cheltenham Im provement Commissioners, to recoverdamae for theinjury done to his furniture and philosophical apparatus by an in. undatioz which took place on his premises on the 26th of July, 18v55, inconsequerce of the negligence of the commis. sionene in the construction and keeping of the sewers of Cheltenham. The defendant pleaded a plea of " Not gailty by Etatate," and calledupon the plaintiff to prove his notice or action This being done, it was objected that the notice was bad; first, because there was no suffiolent ause of .atlon, and, secondly, because it did not appear distinctly that the plaintiff intended to bring an action. Mr. Baron MAR-rrx overruled the objection, and said he thought the clause respecting notice of action ought to be struck out of every Act of Prliament. It was a common scandal that such notices should be required. The case then proceeded, and it appeared that the main sewer at Cheltenham was carried under the river Chelt, a small stem from which the town of Cheltenham took its name, The sewer was arched over, and to a height of several feet it was covered with clay. The sewer emitled itself into a tank below the town, and ultimately emptied itself lower down into the Chelt. It appeared that on the 13th of July, 1855, a heavy storm took place, which so flooded the Chelt that it damaged the sewer; but some deLay took place in making the necesary repairs, and before these were effected another storm took place on the 26th, which so flooded the Chelt and the sewer that a large portlon of the town was put under water, and the plaintiff's premises were Inundated. The filth from the sower cme hnto all his rooms on the ground-floor, spoilt all his carpets, ad rose to sch a height that it did great daame to his philoophical apparatus, &c, to the extent of 17 1. On the part of the plaintiff it was contended that there was negligence in the commissioners in not puttin a flap in the sewer to prevent the water being thrown bac in case of a flood like the present; secondly, that the arch of the sewer under the Chelt ought to have been covered with concrete instead of clay; and, thirdly, that there was improper delay In not effecting the repairs between the 13th and- 26th of July. The plnintiff relied on the 36th section of the Local Act (the 15th and 16th of Vfctoria, cap. 20),whichnmoro - rated the Public Health Act, 188 (Uth and 12th of x tors, chap. 63). at the close of the plaintiff's case, Mfr. Baron MRTIN expressed his opinion that the defendant wVa not liable, and directed the plaintiff to be nonsuited, giving him leave to move the Court to enter the verdict for 1701., the amount of damage done to the plain. tm's property. __
SOUTH WAR.BBIDGE. TO TBE} EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In a pargaph in your journal of Saturday, August1, either your reporter bas made a mistake, or what was stated by the Improvement Commlttee is not correct. I tbereforefeelit a duty incumbent on me, as chairman of the Southwark-bridge Company, to correct this statement, lest the proprietors should think the directors about to sacrifice their interests. The paragraph states that some time since the directors offered to dispose of the bridge for 200,000?, I can assure the proprietors that the directors never made any such offer, 300,0001. being the sum named by the board, at the only interview they ever had with the Improvement Committee, as their price.

Wm,LxcHoLY OcouRCwC.-We have to-day to record the oocurrence of a catastrophe the but too probablo -resit of which is the loss of the lives of two young gentlemen, visitors at Brighton, The namo of one hs Edard fonaldson, aged 19, vho has for the past month been living with his relations in lodgings at 4 Cannon-place. The other Is named Jones, and was living a5so in lodgings at 7, Bed. !ford-squre. A ehort time ago it appears that the two young gentlemen made a joint purchase of a small boat, and were in the habit of going out sailing, sometimes alone, but moore frequently accompanied by some of their acquaintances or friends. It was remarked, however, by the watermen, that the quantity of rigging they carried was too heavy for a boat of such scanty beam, it being only about 14ft. long; andmore than one ancient mariner might have been seen to shake his head and express fears for the fate of a craft so oppressed with canvass, and In the control of such comparatively in. experienced bands. At 3 o'clock on Monday aftenoon the two missing youths started for a sail from opposite the bottom of Preston-street, taking with them only a smal quantity of biscuits and cheese ana a bottle of wine, their intention being to remain out only a few hours, as Donaldson had made rrangements to tae his sisters out for adrive about7 o'clock. Seveno'clock came, butEdward did not make his appearance. Half-past 7, 8 o'dock, arrived and he did not oome. His sisters, however, thought the missing ones had put in at Shoreham, and were detained therei so that for the moment they did not feel much uneainess, their supposition being perfectly reasonable. But while they were thus satisfying themselves of the safety of their friencs, the servants in the house had received, and with kindly deception had concealed, evidence of a very different state of affairs. A coat and hat had been picked up about two miles out at sea, which were ascertained to belong to one of the you Donaldson; and the paddles of the boAt had also been pioked up and identified The night wore on, and still no tidings came of the fate of the unfortnaxte *oung men; and we dare not attempt to describe the agony of the sisters when the servants, concealment being no longer posible, were constrained to reveal their melancholy. xs. plCona and the indisputable grounds upon which they were founded. Beyond what we have written no further tidings have yet been received of the fate of the mising; but there is not the shadow of a hope entrtained of their afety. Dring the gater part of teterday a number of boats were engaged grappling in te Chbannel near to where it Is supposed the boat founderd; but up to the time of our gon to ps their effor bhad not beau tuoesL Both the young gen Ue ae said to have been e ae-eeI iT i na wel and to have won the afDectionand etem of they coe i oat. -B1._Z o,, GuaLara4tn

Elllson talso trading under the name of ndersun), warehouseman, Bread-street, and elswbore This was the examination mne2ting. Wr. Bagley opposed; Mr. Hubbard supported. The case gave rise to a protracted discussion, which will be beet given in the form of a descriptive summary. The bankrupts aoonmts extend over a perlod of about 18 months. They commenood with a deficiency of 1,5931, and closed with unsecured debts, 7,3004, liabilities, 1o,000,, and assets about 1,7001 The personal expenditure s ut down as 1,499L, the trade expenditure at 8004., and th, gos profita at 1600 The bankrapt did not '-ee k, bt i s ugedon is behilf thst mxtra existe upon which a raised cash account had been prepared, showing the application of all cash within about 1001. On the otter hand the officibl asgnee made a report so far different to this allegation as to cause the learned Commissioner to rem&zk that 8671. were uaccounted for. In the case of Siers, his Honour said, the Lords Justices, on appeal from his decision, had passed the bankrupt's examinatior. In that cae the bnEkupt practically had no accounts ; they were altogether unvouched. He owed a lare sum, and he had not a farthing for his creditors. The docision of the superior oourt would appear to intimate that no acceont mnst be taken for an account. The law required the bankrupt to "furish a full, fair, and true account of what he had done with his property, and to vouch for the same by reasonable evidence." That was Lord Eldon's view of the requirements of the law, and the Commissioners of this courtwere required to oertify that due acconnts had been funished. 'ow, oould he subscribe his h-nd to that which was grosly untrue I Mx. Commissioner Evans with characteristic honesty had remarked that he would sooner cut off his arm t n p his signature to some accounts that rere placed before im It was desirable to ascertain what the principle laid down by the Lords Justices was. If it was that this Court must take any account, or the best accont that -any bankrupt might say he could furish, then let it be understood that the examination meeting waa a mere matter of form, A case likeSeller had occurred three or four tirnes before Mr. Commissioner Evans. That leaend Commissoner be. gan life as a merchant, and he aiways applied to the law the prindples of common sense. He was the chief Commissioner of thi court The cost of an appeal was from 401. to 504, a aerioua sunm or a bankrupt, and it was the duty of this oourt so to conform its judgments to those of the superior court as to render such appeca unneoessa7, To do tbJs it was desirable to be Informed of the principle upon which the judgments of the Lords Justioes ws founded. Tn theea of Sellers his present o on was that he should refuse to name a day for the cerificate meetin , and there might be a second appeal. In the case now be fore him the bnk. rupt's tion would be adjourned sine die, with leave to ave a day named for him again to come up when he was prepard wi amended accounts.

Mr. BAGLEY informed the Court that in Sellers' case the trade assignee consented to the bankrupt passing, and that the Lords Justices were influenced by that consent, an intimation which caused his HoEoUR to remxrk that trade assignees were sometimes the bankrupt's own brothers. The conflict of opinion between the two courts having become frequent, it may net be misplaced to state that the prevailing opinion among debtors and creditors is that, although te udgments of this court are generally chrractied by great ability and equity it would not be ad. visable to be without a court of appeni

In only one cae, exdusive of Huntingdon, was a disputed seat given to a petitioner, the exceptional cese being Shigo, which is nolw representod by Mr. J. Wynns, lstead of Mr. T. P. Somers. The grounds upon which the returns were impupgned were in to cae-Mayo nd Droghed,.vlolenoo, intimidation, and undue Influenco; in two cases-Maborough and Beverley-insuffloient qualification of the aitting members; and in five cases-CAmbridge, Wareham, Bath, Runtlndon, and Sllgo-the Improper reception and rejection of votes. In the remaining 16 cases the allegations substantiayreed on by the petitionera wreo those of bribery, corrupt prac. tices, and treating. Out of the nine members who hbave lost their eats, two-- Mr. Heathoote and Mr. Somners-were unseated upon a ecrutlny; one-Mr. Glover-for want of quafication; five -Mr. Neate, Mr. OFlaherty, Mr. Merry, Mr. Wtkin, and Mr. Torresn Wull"gh-for bribery 0ommitted by their agents; and one-Mr. Moore-for undue influence exerciaed by his agents. In no case has a committee in unseating a member declared that he was oont of the acts on a count of which he was unseated. On the other hand, only two petitions-those against the returns of Mr. Ronpell for Lanbeth and of Mr. Bramley.Moore for Maldon-hve been declared frivolous and vexatious. The most important question rised in the course of these inquirie was that which 'a laid before the Mayo Committee-namely, whether the definition of nmdue influence contained In the 5th section of the Corrupt Practices Pre. vention Act is applicable to the case of spiritual intimid,tion. The committee held that it is, and oons%eqently n. seated Mr. Moore, on whose behalf spiritual intimidation was proved to have been practised. The Drogheda petition contained allegations similar to those in the Mayo petition, but the evidence adduoed In support of those allegations was much weaker and less con. deusive, and the answer given to it WAS more complete in the Drogheda than In tho MAyo case, so that the decisions of the two committees cannot be regarded ua oonflicting. In considering the question of agency the oommittees appear to have adopted the general principle that candi. dates ought not to be held liab'e for the acts of unautho. ried paUtisan, except in extreme cases, such ma Gaiway where an organized gystem of bribery was proved to be in existenoe. It was repeatedly laid down that the individua members Of a committee, appointed to adanoe the interests of a candlte, ould not be treated as the agents of that candidate, although he ws liable, *a in the Oxford case, for acts done by them as a committee, In the Wreham ase acts Of bribery and undue inAuence were brought home to Mr. Pike, a member of a committee constituted to pro mote the electlon of the sitting member, but Mr. Caicralf ws not held responsible for those acts. Candidates and their agents appear to have been geneally impres6ed with a dread of bringing themselves within the provisions of the Corrpt Practices Prevention Act. All the sitting members who were examined stated that they had given strict Injunctions to their agenbs to be careful not to do anything which could be regaded as an Infringement of that statute, and all the agents who were eximined had acted " strictly in accordance with those instructions." The Olford and the Yarmouth Committees, however, were not satisfiod with those ssurances, and by unseating the membera zhowed that they took rather a stricter view than the other committees as to the extent to which the liability of a eandidatel for the acts of persons not regularly appointed agents should be carried. Somewhat different views were taken by different com mittees as to what constitetes colourable employment of voters. The Oxford Committee held that the employment of 198 persons as poll clerks and messengers by Mr. Neate's committee, 152 of whom voted for Mr, Neate, wa a colour. able employment, and resolved that, " although it w not proved that the payments to the voters were the primay motive In deciding theirl votes, ye' it appeared to the oommittoe that in many of the cases no adequate services or work were in reality performed." In the Cambridge case the committee held that the employment of 74 messengers was not a colourable employment, as adequate services had been rendered for the payments made. In the rambeth cas, lso, the employment of a considerable number of paid canvassers who had renderd adequate servioes was not held to be illegaL With regard to travelling expenses the committoes have generally acted upon the principle laid down in an able judgment upon that question delivered by Md[r. Deasy, the chairman of the Cambridge Committee. Mr. Deasy, adopting the ruling of the judges in the case of "Cooperv. SBlde," held that a promise to pay travelling expense, and a sub. sequent payment in pursuanoe of such promise were not Illegal, provided that the promise was untonditiominl; but that such a promise and payment would be illegal if msde conditional upon the giving of a vote to a particular c"na didate. In the Ipswich ease the committee came to a resolution that travelling expenses had been paid by the agents of the candidate in exoess of the real disbursements of voters, but that such payments had not been made with a corrupt intention. None of the committece seomed disposed to deal with any great severity with cases of treating. The strongest evidence as to treating was probably that which was given in the Maldon case. The committee there agreed to a resolu. tion that treating was extensively carried on upon tho day of polling, " but It was not proved to the satisfaction of the committee that the acts of treating were committed with the cognizance of T. Sutton Western, FEq., or his agents." No one can examine the evidence given before the various oommittees without remarking that in almost every case in which bribery, corrupt practices, and treating were alleged and proved the persons upon whom they were practied belonged to the class of freemen. From the evidence given in the Ipewich, Maldon, and other cases, the freemen sti remaining in these constituencies appear to be as open as ever they were to corrapt influences, but nearly allthe freemen who appared as witnesses agreed in stating that they derived lees profit from the lat than they ad done from any previous election. Two of the ecses, Pontefract and Maidstone, woere chiefy remarkable for the facts elicited in referenoe to former elections. In conclusion, it remain for us to Atate the steps 'which have been taken to fill up the vacancl caued by the ti. fions.

THE PUBrrC SCHOOL MITCHZS TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Though Ihave no wish orrighttotreps spin on your valuable spae, I am eo anxious to plae the vezata quteio of the public school matches, if posible, on its tme meri, an to bring it to a practical i6szu that I ventoze to offer a few re-arks on the letters already published by you on this xubject. It seems, then, tolerably well agreed that the matches should be played somehow and somewhere. Even Er. James Is probably not o blindly devoted to his "valued friend.," the Eton authorities, as to imagine that the modlcum of eclass and Pagan morality which most boys brig away from a publio school is the most valuable part of an Eton education. That which compensates for the glaring deficiency of such a system of insction, that wbich lmparts sack stamina and vitality to the eharacter that the moral epidemise of society quite Athenia in its brilliant laxity seldom take a permanent hold on it, is the prodigious expansion of the animal spirits ana energis in the cricket and lQotbal1 fields and on the river. No Eton man would willingly re%. the pretensions of his school on the knowrledge imparW& there, or (I do not say it ILvidiously) on anything tC# masters do for It. For 10 boys beneficially influenoed by school exercises and discipline an hundred owe their educeation to the playing-fields and the Broeas In curtailing this developement of school life en Eton head master would find he was indeed killing the hen that laid the golden eggs; and if the threatened school oo=micrio. should take effect it wll assuredly not be in this quarter that the pruning. knife of reform will be applied. The points which have been most dicussed, and to the east purpose, are the temptations of the weekes residenc in London, and the disputed frontier of parental and magisterial authority. As to the former, I am not inclined to be over-fastidious, but it does not seem to me that the question is solved by shifting the responsbility. It may be true that the profligacy of the boy lies at the door of the parent, and not of the master; bt why vplae him in circuatano where this profligaoy is rendered very probable ? There is a fallacy in the argument of your correspondent of yesterday (who ha adopted my nomn de guerrc) where he eompeaes the cae in question to the raoes, the theatre, or anY other fashionable amusement. Eton boys do not go by hundreds to such spectacles: they go as individual members of their respective families, and bAve no temptation to rival each other in lioense. Whereas the Lord'. matche., while they last, are public school life with all its gregarious powers of mischief and without its restraints. There is little enough of cloisteed saceticism at Eton ielf, yet I cannot doubt thast the first step in a profligate course ha often been taken during thi August Saturnalia. I semin therefore, of opinion that the matcheas would be be4 played during the half-year. And now for the offended dignity of the "parents." It is very eszy to mass them together under this imposing term, but in reality their interests and views are a various as those of other people. Some being much poorer tha others feel expense much more. Those who habitually pas the summer abroad suffer most from the inconvenienoe of the detention in London. Parents, too, it is needlesn to say, propose a very different standard of morality to their children. I remember a boy whose father (a elrgyman) habitually took him to the Caino; the scruples of others prosoribe even the opera and the ballroom. In short, I do not beLive the oollective opinion of paents to be On the one side or the other. All of them, however, I hope, would agree In the desirethat the matches should be plyed; most wold think Lord's gound the be6t plce, cud a ey large majority would prefer the half-year to the holy. dals. eonvinoed tht Mr. James is mistakenu to the comprtiTve advantages of a metropolitan gronud and the privat ground. of the two choo In theborst plPe, publicity is just what givest piquany to the oont and ho may depend upon It that no friendly sarn, however plucky and generous the combatants, san aver In the long rutn supply the p lace of awell-thronged rin, Bti , aainth what baecomes of the old Etonlang?

-TIT ATLA.NTIa TELEGBXAPH. - VALENT , IRELAND, AUG. 8. vhe6tyat elec*tio cable is at length fairly on the way Rno I W Western termimus with every present prospect of realling its mission. Fastaned by one end to tho shore of VAlontia, it is now trailing its unfolding circles aoross the Atlantic Ooean. On the evening of Friday, the 7th of A%1. gust, 1867, the telegraphic squadron bore away from the cost of Ireland, delivering the cable into the sea at?, slow and steady rate. The expedition had started faul 'of hope and spirits on Thursday at daybreak, bat owing t.o an un. fortunate COembcfax5 was obliged to put back t7 mporariy almost immediastely afterwards. When about four miles of the thick shore en I of the cable had beer paid out it became entangled with '6he maohinery, owing to a moraentary want of watchf lae- 3 on the part of osne pemso wlhose daty it was to %ttend to the movements of the paying-ut 6heaves, which required ?,uring the passage over them of the heavy portion of sho ce cable, 10 miles in length, a little extracare, the sheaves having been designed primarily with the objoct of delivr ring ever them at a proper-peed, and at amwiimum cc strain, the maa taegraph, hfieb, ae Is well knownx, is of very mueh smaller ,diameter than the 5hore ends5 asnd which constitutes the mentire lngth fr3m cost to c'*st with the exception of 30 mnilesonly. iTastat tks untet4unate moment the Niaga aligh*y rounded, and her vrti*it being brought upon the thick unyielding shore cablm it necessadLly snapped. Tmmedinsltews'wsre t*er to underran the sunken line, 'nnd.were attendeal. y pAfteb succees, notwithatasdiag its Masive weight, whkh-is eist tons to the mile. In this tseivico-tho boais ef the'Isopard and of the Sasquehanna -zeddered-gruet w1 valuabi service. The rdsed portion waws4hen joibed up ss firmly as ever to the remsdindar - the Mtagara,s table, and the work pro. -ze6dede,ss befoea. Xhe *ips at oe recommenced their out- wd'voyage '. a slow ste of saiing, since which time the -&hk hans coeinueda-t run oat in a safe and satisfactory xtner. The machEinery woeAs admirably, and entirely answers the 'aaihgnme-e:pectrati-wsnc of the desizners. It differs in marycesential points from any of the mechanical apialees hi*3rto used for regulating the delivery of *teiegrapkhi csbleseinto the -a. The apparatus generally used h-h'concisted of a broa. drum, around which the cable was wrrarped several times, and the revolution of which wra chetkci by brake-straps acting upotn the periphery of the drum. lDrnder swch an arLmngerent tho cable could only be extriocted rom the drum, if required, with the greatest difficulty, anld -ot the sase time, if any considerable strain shofLd-arise, the hard level surface of the drum acted upon an- exceddinth limited portion of thLe external coating of the cable, owing to the cylindrical form of the latter, and therefore-tendod to flat(en it. In the Atlantic machinery on thecontmry, the -able passes round a series of sheaves goooved to'receive andembracorearly half its circumference. The pressnm is thus thoroughlydistributed, and the circular form 4 preaerved. Moreover, the sheaves being fitted on their-axeoc-ontside of the bearings, the cable can be released from the ;paying-out machinery at once when required, and the indicating apparatus, which forms a portion of the pay. ing-out appliances used for the Atlantic telegraph, effects the greet improvement of enabling the engineer to ascertain at any-eaonxent, -ith accuracy, the strain which the cable is enduring. -Ier MaWests ship Cyclopg, Commander Dayman, which bas recentlyrettrned from sounding on the Great Circle Arc between'Vvlentia, in Ireland, and Trinity Bay, in Newfoundland, will lead the squadron across the Atlantic. 'The-result-of the soundings made by Lieutenant Dayman correspond with and generaly confirm the results reported by CaptAiun Berryman of the United States' frigate Arctic. Between the Li deg. and 48 deg. of west longitude, and between:49 deg. 30 min, and 62 deg. 20 min. of north lati -tude, including a space of 1,290 miles, 32 specimens of the bottom, 'from depths ranging between 1,500 and 2,424 fathoms, Iave been preserved, and they show, with one exception a remarkably soft bottom of oozy nature. Near $he Irish coast the bottom was found to consist -chiefly.of sand or mud, with short intervals of rock, and near that of Newfoundland a thick blue mud. Three small icebergs, near the coast of Newfoundland, were the only ice that was observed by Lieutenant Day. man. MON-AY MORSING, 7.30. Upwards of 200 miles of cable have now been paid into the sea. The sbips have approached the deep water, the present soundings being over 1,o00 fathoms. All is going well. The signals to the shore continue to be as good as ecan be desired. (By BREITSH i-n D IRISH MAGaNrc TELEGRAPII.) VALENTIA, AUG. 1". An accident of some description has occurred to the Atlantic cable. Up to 4 o'clock in the morning of yesterday (Tuesday) constant signals and messages had been received, in one of which, received some 20 hours previously, it was stated that the ship had nrrived iD, the two miles' dept}h At 4 a.m. (Irish time) the electric ignals suddenly ceased. On testing for insulation there was found to be a total 10s3, which from indications of resistance would seem to have occurred at a distance of from 350 to 4-00 miles from Valentia. In the absence of any means of communication with the sips it is, of coturse, impossible even to guiess at the cause ,of embarrassment; there is, however, quite sufficient room for hope at present that the loss of insulation may have been caused by some injury to a portion being payed into the water but not dissevered from the remaining portion of the cable, and that they will be enabled, by the aid. of appliances on board, to haul in and repair so much of it as will re-establish continuity and insulation. With a view to this possibility, signals of great energy are now being constantly sent from this station through the cable, but no answer has at present been received. GEORGE SA.WARD, Secetary.

CThE MUTINY IN INDLk.-The reports of the ,oceedings at some of the loyal meetings of Hindoos and .hometans in India, although brief, contain some points worthy of notice as exhibiting the sound good feeling manifested towards theimaperial Government. Thus, a meeting was held by some young men at the premises of Baboo Gooroo Churn Dey, Bhowanipore, Chuckerbaria, in the suburbs of Calcutta, and a committee was appointed, who "felt it a necessity to remove false apprehensions and unfounded tales regarding the exaggerated affairs of mutiny" from the minds of peaceful subjects. The committee arrive at the conclusion that " some of the members will alternately take round at every night, with a view of catching or detecting any wrongdoer that may be found in the work of abetting some such malicious tales or rumours as the town will hbe' looted' and plundered by the Sepoys on some certain day, and its inhabitants be cut down to pieces; and will, by every means in their power, Impress on the minds of timid and credulous people the idea of the mightiness of the power of the British Government to repel aggression of any foreign enemy, however powerful and indomitable, or put dowxn any internal disturbance and disorder." The committee thought it desirable to add to the numerical strength of their members by enlisting the sympathy and co-operation of all the respect-able .mabitants of Bhowanipore, and to hold meetings occasionally to consider further measures if necessary ; and in order to carry their object into full effect, the committee secured the services of some strong and brave men, and thought it proper to ask the magistrates of the 24 Pergunnahs the oo-operation, if necessary, of the police. The committee finally determined to communicate to the Government these "noble feelings of loyaltyand attachment to the beneficial rule that had actuated them to meet " The names of the committee are worth quoting as an oxercise for the pronunciation of Hindoo words. These loyal subiects jisduded the following "baboos" :-Gooroo Churn l)ey, Eisan C;under Mullick, Womnesh Chunder Mitter, Raj MHohondre Mitter. Nobo Kissen Rose, Ohunder Coomer Bose, Proeeno Coonier Day Russick Chunder Dutto, Puttit Pabun D;anriee, Prosono &omer Chaturjee, Euro Prosad Chatnijee, UJmbica Churn Banuirjee, Xhettur Mohun Doss, and Gopal Chunder Goopta. The Mahometans of CAalutta aet and expressed "tho utmost confidence in the Government," and declared that "having formed (found ?) a dwelling and asylum under the Government, where they live -in peace and safety, protected by the equity and foster. ing crme ef the British Government, and suffertng no kind of injury or 40s55" that having, moreover, ever lived in safety and conifort under British rule, and having never been interfered with imn religious matters, they were determined "with lohe utmost eagerness and sincerity to serve the Qovornment in case of necessity to the utmost of their abilitiee aud meaus." Tbe murder of "God's crcatures" by -tho bloodthirsty and barbarous mutineers excited " feelings of deep regret and disgust" in the bosoms of the loyal Mehot2metans. The inhabitants of the tovn and .llah of Bs:raset telS the Governor-General that they "obeerved -with the deepeat regret that ignorant, desgning, and artful individuals, under slight or no pretext, have raised a feoling of sApicion in the minds of the native soldierx and the unedgqated population towards the Governineat:" 4 Ve therefcre beg (they continue) to " offer y'our l:srdshIp a sincere and grateful expression of our con- -dence, Etat init endeavoes for the moral and sooial ImProvem:n:t of -thepeople of this country the British Gowvernnlenthas been actusted by the purest of motives. History does not record a .comquering nation differeit in afth rOm the conguered, mnore tolerant towards the religious betof of its mubjecte. Up to this period of its hast"y we fIaly belihee that there has been no intention on the prxt of Government to inteeere with the religious ioelieft to sect orocaste of the natives of this .onr-,but a4 on the other handihere has always been a marked and Aecided endeasour to avoid in any way disturbingtireifioaSfeelingaof.ither Hindoo or Mumsulman." She Americans of Calcutta also asme 1o:ward to supportthe Qovmrnment, and l9etk though by]Lo mmeas least, the French zesideAts. headed by their Consul at Calhotta, issued the followiDg manifesto, which we print in the original:-" En prksence des sraves circonstances daves lesouelles o trouve astuellenent af pays par suite de la r6solte,. mains armaes d, oer4ains r6giments natifs de l'Iude, 1s soxssigns, tousI rdsidaute FPangis, Ii Calcutta, en vue dn Xdangers on penvealt enzr du'n n3 oment A l'antre les propx!iWts, leg families, et avie, sotout rIdu)i* d'un cominonIicoord et! viennent sen mettre,a d,lspotsiion do votre Excelln'ice, en cas -do esein Ipiast dc vonloir bien necepter leogls ser-: vj4lonsse bi-st commun, at comme preuve do patriob s:le! et de dvevuement snvers Sa Alaeste 1: RLeine *d'Ane-| terre."

'?IHlE INDIAN MI3MOZBA& TO THE EDITOR OF TEI1 TlThS. ir,-_mr. He*d, in his letter on the Indian muntinies in 9erted in Thke Times of the 7th inst,, says:-" By a m^,st foolish subservience to ignorant saints the Govegrr,,,t have for years past given far too much cotnte-',J. to missionaries and schemes for the oonversion ot 'th natives to Christianity. The Sepoys, who are in mo te direct con. nexion with Europeans than any other Ola'.s, have seen this movement more plainly than others at ' distance, and their distrust has, in consequence, been 'm' re confirmed." Mr. Head gives no facts to v_pport this assertion. I venture to give what Englisb.MeL like-that is, a collection of facts, which, at this mosnut of eity and peril, may enable the publio to jwdge how far Mr. Head is correct or othervwise. L The chief succest of Christian missipns has been in South India, wkere tiere are nearly 80,000 Christian converts and rmany native preachers, and where large districts have been systemsitically traversed by itinerating missionaies; but no pblic disturbance whatever has taken plawe, and the southern districts are the most quiet in India. 2. In what way has Government countenanced missionaries? The only way hs been by grants.in-aid to micslonaryschools. But this was conceded a few years ago on the statistical fact that missionary ashools had become so popular with the people that the scholars far outnumbered the scholars at Government schools where Christianity was excluded; that is, as sated in the House of Commtaons in the debate en education in India in l855, that there were 404 Government schools, kaving 25,362 pupils; but that Christian mission schools numbered 1,627, with 96,177 scholars Thene scholars ate sent by their parents to the nission schools, in which the avowed object is to convert the natives to Christianity, and where, in many cases, a weekly payment is made by the pupils; and yet with. all the prestige, ' he wealth, and the influence of Government, excluding the Blble and Christian books of Instiuction, the missionary schools and schol)rs Qerceed those of the -Government four. fola. Beyond these recent grants-iit-aid we know not how it can be said that the Government have countenanced misaionaries. We might go-further, and show how it has been otherwise; but we forbear, and do not wish to be ccusers at such a time as this. 3. Missionary operations are usually carried on in cities and districts eLtirely separated from military stations. Sepoys have rarely the opportunity of coming into contact with missionaries. For example, in the provinces of Tinnevelly and Travancore we can reckon 22 missionary stations belonging to the Church Missionary Society, at two of which only troops are stationed. There are seven stations in Xishnaghur, near Calcutta, in none of which are troops stationed. Moreover, it is well known that Sepoys live in military cantonments, and that the missionaries very seldom come into contact with them. Over this inaCcessible position of the poor igiorant Sepoy, isolated from every source of insiruction which is open to all his countrymen, we have good reason to mourn. Before proceeding further, let us for a moment suppose that the Sepoys had been as open to missionary instruction as other classes of natives in India, and that the legitimate results of the bold and faithful preaching of the Gospel bad followed; that a body of true Christians had been raised up in the ranks of the Bengal army; that these men had been as eligible for promotion as the petted bigoted Brahmins,we may question how far such a conspiracy as the present could ever have been concocted, or remain undiscovered for mnonths, nay, perhaps for years. We now come to the last clause of Mr. Head's letter, who signs himself " late of the Bengal civil service, and as knowing Upper India and its people as well as he knows Northamptonshire." Hle says, " We had better moderate our benevolent intentions of reforming, civilizing, and Chris. tianizing the people of India." In that coantry, it appears from a return made to Parliament, we are in contact with above 180 millions of people, chiefly our fellow-subjects. What is their real condition? Although I served in India for 12 years, yet I would prefer quoting the sentiments of some of our able, experienced statesmen and historians of India. What says Mr. Butterworth Bailey, whose authority no one vho is noquained with Indiawill question? Mr. Bailey says:- "The offence of perjury can be expiated by very simple penances, and the inhabitants of India must undergo a great moral regeneration before the evil which saps the very foundation of justice and bars all confidence between man and man shall be effectually remedied. "1 As late as 1827 the Bengal Government advert to the want of veracity in the natives as matter of notoriety. They say it is needless to remark how much the proceedings of all our tribunals are delayed and embarrassed by the notorious disregard for trath so generally displayed by the natives in giving evidence from their want of moral principle, evils which cannot be mitigated or remedied by any direct or immediate modification of our judicial insti. tutions." The accomplished historian, Edward Thornton, in his book, entitled India, its State and Prospects, at page 147, says:- " To what cause, then, shall we attribute that prostration of mind and depravity of heart which have sunk a great people into wretchedness, and rendered them the object of political contempt and of moral abhorrence ? The answer is readily obtained-to superstition, to the prevalence of a mighty system of religious imposture, as atrocious as it is extravagant, which in the same degree that it dishonours the Supreme Being corrupts and debases his rational creatures; which upon the most outrageous absurdity engrafts the most abominable vice, and rears a temple to false and filthy deities upon the ruins of huanra intellect and human virtue. It were criminal to conceal or palliate the real cause of Hli-doo degeneracy. It is false religion, and nothing else. The gods whom the Hindoos worship are impersonations of all the vices and all the crimes which degrade huLman nature; and there is no grossness and no vil. lany which does not receive countenance from the example of some or other of them. The vilest and most slanderous impurity pervades their mythology throughout, is interwoven with all its details, is at once its groundwork and its completion, its beginning and its end. T'ne robber has his god from whom he invokes a blessing on his attempt against the life and property of his neighbour. Revenge, as well as rob. bery, finds a kindred deity; and cruelty, the never failng companion of idolatry, is the essence of the system. The rites and ceremonies are worthy of the faith; they may be summed up in three words-folly, licentiousness, and cruelty. Penances, silly and revolting, are the means of expiating sin. Grossness the most horrible, both in nature and in degree, from which the most abandoned characters in the most abandoned parts of Europe would recoil enters into public worship, and the higher festivals are honoured by an increased measure of profligacy. That unhappy class of females who everywhere else are regarded with con. temptuous scorn, or with painful commiseration, are in India appendages to the temples of religion. The mdinloo faith, in perfect conformity wi1h its character, demands barbarous as well as licentious exhibitions, and torture and death are among its most acceptable modes of service. From sach deities and such modes of worship what can we expect but what we find? If the sublinme example of perfect purity which true religion places before its followers be calculated to win to virtue, must not universal contamination be the necessary consequence of investing pollution and crime with the garb of divinity'? If men find licentiousness and cruelby associated with the ceremonies of religion, is it possible that they should believe them to be wrong? Can they be expected in private life to re. nounce as criminal practices which in public they have been taught to regard as meritorious ? Wil they abhor in the world that which they reverence in the sanctuary'? It were absurd to believe it. "1 The Hindoo system prescribes the observance of frivolous ceremonies, and neglects to inculcate important moral duties. But its pernicious influence does not terminate there ; it enforces much that is positively evil. By the institution of castes it estranges man from his fellows, and shuts up avenues of benevolence; invests one part of society with the privilege of unrestrained indulgence, casting over them the cloak of sanctity, however unworthy,-shielding them from the consequences of their actions however flagitious, and condemns anbther to hopeless and perpetual debasement, without the chance of emancipation or improvement. A system more mischievous or iniquitous, better calculated to serve the interests of vice or destroy those of virtue, seems beyond the power of the most perverted ingenuity to frame." I leave it to your readers to judge how fsr Mr. Head is right in sayiiig that we should moderate our benevolent intention to a people thus immersed in gross darkness and crime. I remain.
