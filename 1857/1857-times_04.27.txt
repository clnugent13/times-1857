MOHB7TMAR~XTa~d - TYIKT LLI~- - -- K,NA-MRKTan OITYXNTLLGBO. Saturday Evening. I The English funds to-day have again been dull, anc have closed at a reaction of an eighth. The news of the uncertain state of aaifn in Oldna and the Indian Archipelago pending the arrival of reinforcements was the principal cause of the prevailing heaviness, although the rate of exchange at Calcutta by this mail is slightly less unfavourable, and will tend to diminish the eagerness for skipping silver. Consols for money -were first quoted 93 to i, and they left off at 92i to 93 for money, and 93 toG for the 7th of NAy, For the now account in June the last price wsa 0 tO i. Bank Stock left off at 213 to 215. Reduced, 92 to i; Now Three per Cents., 921 to J; and Exchequer-bills (June), 4s. to la. dis count; (March), 2s. discount to 2s. prernium. The demand for money continued active both in the Stock-Exchange and the diecount-market. A furtffier sum of about 15,0001. in bar gold was withdrawn from the Bank for exportation, to the continent. 'Foreign securities were rather heavy, and prices In some cases experienced a slight decline. Turkish St:'per Cents. for money were quoted 3,%. and for the account 93X; the* Four per Cents. Guaranteed were negotiated at 100k for money, and 10O and 109 for the account. The other business comprisedBrazilian' Five per Centa., l00 for money; Peruvian Four-and-a-half per Cents., 77; Portuguese T4ree per Cents., 44, and J; Rusian Four-and-aHEif per Cents., 98 ; Spanish New Deferred, for mnexa y, 25i; for the account, 25 and 25 ; and Spanih certificates of coupon not funded, 6k ad. The final quotations of the French Three per Cer on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. MOb. for money, and 69f. 60c. for the acomunt, showing a fractional advance. The shares of the Bank of France remain heavy from the approaching iswe of new stock. The telegraphic advices from China state that the rate of exchange at Shanghai was 6s. 7id., and at Canton 4s. d., showing an advance of id. In each initance. The shipments of tea to date were 514500,01lb. against 68,800,0001b. last year, and of milk 60,600 bales against 32,432. Tea and silk werearce, and pricea so much higher as to preclude purqhases. There was little political newss the Bleet abdaining from any fresh demonstration until it sbould have been sufEciently strengthened. The arrival of this mail p roduced no alteration to-day in the London tea-market. Ath Calcutta the rate of exchange has receded to 2s. 2d., showing a movement of 1i per cent. At 13ombay the quotation was 2s. 1ld., and presents a fractional advance, but the money-market had become easier. It is estimated that the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Pera will take out on the 4th from 600,0001. to 650,0001., principally silver, for India and China. The railway meetings of the week have not been numerous. The report of the East Indian Company states the general position of the works and refers to the progres, made up to the date of. the latest advices. The increase in the trafic on the portion of the line opened is considered satisfactory. ACcording to the report of the Peebles Company the dividend will be at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum, leaving a balance of 6401. The treffioxhibits a steady improvement. The dividend of the Arbroath and Forfar Railway has been confirmed at he rate of 54 per cent. per annum; with a bonus at the rate of 1 per cent. from the surplus profits of former years, making togetter 68 per cent. At the St. Andrew's meeting the cividend declared was at the r-ate of 6* per cent. The following letter explains the arrangements Iatcy made by the Customs. for facilitating the passenger traffic from the continent: 4"The Lords of the Treasury have, on the recommexidatlon of the Commissioners of Customs, $.ain authorized the removal of passengers' baggage from Folkestone without examination till its arrival at London-bridge ttion, and the system has now been In operation during the lut week or two. "Their Lordships are thus evidently deairous of affording the utmost iaoility to the travelling world. And this is fully proved by the letter written by Sir C. Trevelyn to the Board of Customs on the matter, a copy of whioh has been communicated to the directors of the South-Eastern Ralway. Sir Charles states that ho is ' directed to inform the Board that when their Lordahipe conceded to the SouthEastern Railway Company the privilege of having the through baggage from Paris, Boulogne, &o., examined at I.ondonubridge, and consented to arrangements for the attendance of officers at a considerable expense, they expected tbat the system would be of a permanent nature. They fully bdieved that the prictice of running through tidal trains would be continued throughout the year without interruption. Their Lordships must thereforeexpress the disappointment which they felt when they found that, after a few months, those trains were discontinued, and the arrangement for the examination of baggage atLondonbridge had become no longer needful. "'In consenting to that arrangement their Lordshi a were influenced only by a desire to give every facility to tTe travelling commtnity, though at a consilderable expense. 33ut, as it must be obvious that nuch inconvenience to the public service is experienced by frequent changes of this nature, their Lordships wil not, therefore, be prepared to continue this indulgence after the present season, unless auch arrangement can be made by the companies as will give the public the advantage which must at all times accrue from it by continuing The tidal trains throughout the year. "'With this understanding their Lordships authorize the renewal ef the privilege from the date requested.' " Upon those conditions the company have accepted the Indulgence which their Lordships, out of consideration to the interests of the public, have gnted them. " Nothing can be more satisfactory than this. It is strong testimony in saupport of the principle which has been so long advocated. Bat if railway oompanies wil not cooperate in carrying it out to the advantage of the publio it Is of little use for the Treasury and Customs' authorities to lend their aid in the matter. At the present time, instead of the through passengers being brought from Polkeatone to London immediately on their arrival, they are detained there upon an average for nearly an hour and a half. Why should this be ? It was proved last season that from 16 to 20 minutes was quite sfficient to do all that was needful in etarting the tidal train, even with a large number of passengers. " The Lords of the Treasury have not formed an opinion as to the advantages arising from the system without good grounds. By the annual report of the Board of Customs, recently publshed, it will be seen that during the short time it was in operation in the autumn of last year no less than 11,820 packages of baggage were examined and delivered at London.bridge, the average time being only 21 minutes each day. It must also be remembered that as the baggage of each passenger is examined so it is eeivered, and the owner is at liberty to take his or her departure at once. There is no train to wait for, as at Folestone. And all, too, has been done without the public having had to pay a single penny for agency or commission of any sort. The Commissoners of Customs may therefore very well saq in their report that ' there cau be littl e onbt tbat wle the arrangement lasted it was attended 'with considerable comfort and advantage to the public.' Finally, it may be observed that the public are very 'much indebted to the personal exertions of the commissioners themselves for these advantages, and that they present a pleasing contrast to the disgraceful system of delay, annoyance, cheating, and trickery practised upon travellers by the touting agents at Folkestone. The prospectus has been issued of the Pied. MonteSe 3!Mining Company, with a capital of 60,0001. in 11. shares. The object istowbrk ertain copper and lead mines in the Val d'Osella, Piedmont, and the Canton Tesin, Switzerland, which are to be obtained in perpetuity in consideration of 20,000 paid-up shares, 5,0001. in cash and a royalty of one-ffteenth. A reportfromIr J. J. Watson on thevalue of the property accompanies the prospectus. On the subject of the weekly Bank returns a correspondent writes: "Sir,-With regard to the weekly returns of the Bamk of England one thing is certain, that they are ready for the directors at the weekly meeting, and could be Posted outstide the door of the Bank parlour within 10 minutes after the directors have met. It is mere childishness to retain themr until the Gaozc of Friday, in accordance with the Aot of Parliament. The Act meant publicity without delay. Those iteturns were 'intended to have the effect of a baro. ester, and to point out the course mercantile men should puse. U onder the present system they are virtually not tated'cpon ntil the oMonday week following their date; whike by adopting the course I recommend several dasiv would he saved, Thanks toyou for taking this important ,nbject up. "RB,"y . In 'reference to the aboveg it must be rearsked that there i5 no occasion even for waiting until the Thurdday morning. It is believed that the returns are al*Aysoompleted by Tuesday evening, although crobably sowai little acceleration wouild be required, *no er that they might be transmitted in time for the Gazette. If the Gazette could not publish them on Tueisday, theymight at all evenX, be inserted in the daily papers of Wecneeiday. The- anlexed relates to the Communication inszerted on Fridy regarding the liabilities of ehareJwldeain jointstock banks:- "Sir,-Youx correspondent Itlan ha enumerated the ootclh banks enjoying Iloyal chaters, rwith limited liabi. litr, but ha not givn thenames of thee similarlsituated omlpsanies doin business with India and the esiomes,, They are til Bank of Australsl, the Bank of British North Ameiica, the E:ngllah, Scottish, Sad Austraian Chaerod Bankt t,he Ionden Chartered BankC of Ausrlia, the Oriental Bank Corporation, and th.

The woollen trade of this district continues rather dull, and manufacturers are working fewer hours than they were lastmonth. The home demandfor goods-iaonly moderate for the season, being affected by both the tightess of the money-market and the somewhat cold and changeable weather. It is evident that a large amount of sprIng goods is in the hands of the drapers and tailors, the consuptive demand for them having lbeen checked by the absence of a suitable season for their wea-r. The expectation that the forthcomnwg sales of colonial wools in London tmayhave somne inlence on the Prices of cloths is operating to the diszadvantage of manufactureM and the week's'businiess has been chiefly confined to what haes been don ih tho foreig trade. As to wools, prices have oertainly been a haet easier, but there is no neral expectation that pricos are about to undero mch change, the suppvy , a r is well known, not beinmat arl in advance ox te legitimate demand.

At this time of year business in worsted piece goods Is usually quiet; but at present extreme caution is used and the transiactions ace limited. The few dealings thatoccur, however, are generally akt late p rices. Manmufacturers have taken the precaution to restrict the production, as they cannot afford to augment their stocks to any extent. Business in the wazrehouses is pervaded by a quiet tone, and transations are on,ly to a mnoderate amount. Woae yarsae wo ithout material alteration in price. The demand for them Is not extensive8; and in mostInstances where contracts a offered the rates are unsatisfactory to the spiner.Sles are consequentlysiemply restricted to the immediate requiements of triote. Much caution is exercised In this department, and Wrore greater activity can be maanifeted either the rates rrent for the raw material must recede or those of ars be materially enhanced. Cotton yarns are exce dingl ul few transactionns are repiorted in the fmue uier,bti warps next to nothing is doing, animrsonpealg that easer rateswil shortly rule. The wool-market is without animation.

LONDON, MONDAY, APRTL 27, 1857. Parliamentary Reform is now a Parliamentary question. This is no truism, for till quite lately it was a popular question, and one that had hardly shown itself within the walls of Parliament. It is now more Parliamentary than popular. Every-. where you are asked with much plausibility, and at least a wide concurrence, " Who wants "Reform? Do you want another vote? Do "you ? Do you? Have you even registered ? "When did yolu vote last ? Did you ever vote? "Do you know who are your representatives?' Thnee particular questions will be understood, of course, to ajpply to the metropolis; but ths metropolis; it must be considered, has by far the strongest case, in - the abstract, for Parliamentary Reform in the whole empire. Its popuilation is the wealthiest, the best educated, the most orderly, and the worst represented-that is, with the least proportion of members. Scotlnd and even Ireland are close boroughs compared with the metropolis. So, if the demand for Parrlimentary Reform is at. zero in the metropolis, -that-Settles the question as to its general popularity! Bat all over the country it is a rare thing to find a cry for Parliamentary Reform. Does this county *Afnt more members? Is that Ilourishing borough iu4ignant- at its unrepresented state t Where is the crowd of small yeomen, or even towln householders, 'askiing for county votes? We ar - speaming only of the fact. The faet is, that w oile there never was a stonger cas in theory for Reform, people generally seem to feel it only as a matter of theory. But, granting all this-and it matters not to our purpose whether it ie .granted or not,-how does it affect the question which a Government has to ask itself ? When a Cabinet meets at a critical se6son, and asks whether or when it shall enter on the field of Parliamentary Reform, can it venture to, rely on the fact that there is ne present palpable " pressure from "withouf' on the subject! No, it cannot; for tne obvious reason that thisisnow aParliamentary, not a popular question. At any reasonable time, -next year, for example-for it hardly seems reasonable to destroy a Parliament before it has even broken its shell and seen the light of day,anybody may rise up and propose this or that partial measure, or a full-grown Reform Bill, with the fairest chance of carrying the House with him, and putting the Mniter into a most unpleasant situation. But, bad as that would be, a worse contingency is ponsible, and, in our opinion, even probable. It is, that on the rojection of such a Bill by a well-disciplined Ministerial majority, the country might be raised in its favour, and the Parliamentary converted into a popular question. In such an out -door agitation there might be faction, there might be hypocrisy, there might be pure mischief, but that matters little; an agitation begun under these cirumnrstances would take its course, and carry the day, to the great damage of all politicians foolhardy enough to set their faces against it. So it is enough for the present purpose that this is aParliamentary,capable of being turned, at a very short notice, into a' popular, question. To anticipate such an sgitation-and it ought to be anticipated-we must consider on what points it would rin. For that inquiry an obvious clue is to be found in the theoretical defects of the existing syitem. Those defects may now seem ridiculous. They may seem but shadowy grievances, statistical ghost, giants on paper; but they are the channels and the hollows in which the inundation will run and diffuse itself when the bank hal- once burst. Every spectral anomaly, each disparity of figures and eccentricity of proportion, that now shows only an arithmetical or superficial or linear existence, will then assume a substantial and tremendous vitality. The people of England now repose upon Parliament, and are quiet; because, though they know the repreaentative system to be very defective, they think Parliament will set it right in due time, and that before very long. But this flattering confidence ought not to be abused. With the memories of the last Reform Bill before us, we strongly deprecate the logic of waitng tiU the pressure is too strong to be resited. At present, we may say, the game is inthe hands of the more educated, the more enlightened, and the more political classes. Government, and those of whom Governments are made, have till the initiative. The day may not be distant when the ground will be occupied with some huge, misshapen, irrational creature of misrule, too strong to be displaced, and but a sorry subject for correction. We may have to deal with the popular Reform Bill, an affair of points and firast principles, made expresly to awake the agitations of which it affects to be the fruit. There are statesmnen in the House of Commons who might think it worth their while, and not below their character, to adopt such a battlehorse. But if, as we fully believe, a Reform Bill, of one kind or another, will be passed before long, then we submit it is very desirable that the first conception and the rough draught of the Bill ihould come from those who have to mould the plastic material to the intended shape and cut the block to the modeL If Lord PArLmsmOw hes to give us a Reform Bill, we trust he will have his own materials to work iupon. Now, there are materials, or general principles, of Parliamentary Reform of confessed importance, but more likely, judging from experience, to proceed from Mnisters and legislators than from outdoor agitators. The latter feel themselves under no special obligation to guard the franchise from disorder and abuse. It is not their affair, though they might not object to aew it done by others. It is not the office, or always the interest, of a publican to stop intoxication, though he does not wish hix customers to go too far, and is glad to ee the police doing their duty. But certainly it is the business of a Mhinister still possessing the initiative in Parliamentary Reform to provide that the franchise shall go together as much as possible with the best qualifications for its proper exercise-education, character, and responsible employment. It certainly is more important to give it to those who are proved to be intelligent, and whose place in society showvs them to be trustworthy, than to those who are certainly indigent, certainly ignorant, and probably corrnpt. If a large proportion of the latter must be admitted to square our system and remove invidious exceptions, it is all the more advisable to secure the correcting influences of education and position. We fully admit there are great practical difficulties to be encountered in giving a political status to the free denizens of the intellectual world. In respect of rates, and even taxes, they may be " airy nothings," without " a local habita" tion or a name." But the whole question of Parliamentary Reform is one of difficulties, and we do not see why they are to be weakly admitted against the highest and best elements of our social system, and boldly encountered only for the sake of the lowest. Whatever the objections which reason or wit may suggest, no principle can be alleged against giving votes to the members of aUl the learned professions, to all University graduates and holders of certificates from authorized Colleges and schools, to the commissioned officers of the Axmy, Navy, and Militia, to railway servants of a certain rank, to schoolmasters, and many more of similar qualifications. On the other hand, while we are opening the doors, and to a certain extent relaxing those. restrictions which are proved by printed lists and rate-books, it might serve to counteract the dangers of this course if we insisted more on the personal qualifications inseparable from the elector. Why not require each man to write his own name and vote at the poll- I ing-booth ? That would exclude the wholly un- educated; and, even if the younger hands could get up a sign manual and a name for the occasion, as every rogue once learnt his neck verse, still that would itself be a first step in learning, and might lead to higher achievements in the field of literature. We have now been passing the whole population through schools for half a century. We have had infant schools in every towin in England for more than thirty years; and, if there has not been a strictly national system of education, it las not been tbrough the fault of Governments, or for want of carefully studied proposals. The very objection 'which has prevailed against the national plan has been the sufficiency of private enterprise. So it is high time to reap the fruits of a literary age, and to require from every man what it must be his own fault if he cannot do,one line of writing. We have no bias whatever ozr this point, and, if any chance of an unfair operation does present itself, it is rather in favour of the thin-fingered and supple artisan than the huge fist and horny palm of the field labourer. T'he provision, ho6wever, is one to be considered on its own meritx. The results of the late election suggest another proposal, often made, and with much to be said for it. When we see some of the most important constituencies in the empire bringing in two candidates with 6,000 voteo, and throwing out two others with 5,000, or perhaps 5,500, it is inapos- sible not to bo ssiblo if a poitIvt less to the Legislature in the non-re-ain of two good men, and a positive injury in the vitualnon-reprewentation of 5,000 electors for a- whole Parliament. In the case of the "uriicor" counties, the return of three members by a languid eonsti. tuency, just strong enough and decided enough to be divided into a majority and a minority, is a still more flagrant injustice, and one without even long prescription in its favour. Such rettzrns would be prevented by the simple expedient of three heats, but only two votes to each elector. As a general rule, a good minority ought not to be disfranchised; and we caunot but suspect the government of this country would have been steadier for the last 30 years, and its oscillations less violent, if minorities had enjoyed a less intermittent and more recognized influence. Our readers will observe that we are more upon principles than details, and that, therefore, we have not to apologize for omissions; yet we cannot omit that no Refonn Bill will satisfy the people, once roused on the subject, that does not disfranchise a score or two of the small boroughs, give new members to the metropolis and other populous districts, and infue new blood into the thin constituencies of the mere agricultural counties. There cm hardl be a question as to these requirement3; it is common sense to grant them, temerity to refuse them. There is plenty of time to weigh all these demands and obviate the several difficulties in their way between this and next February; but that must be done by the Minister, who would hope to have a quiet berth to do any good in the session of 1858.
.We gave our readers last week a general introduction to the character and objects of the new institution caled " the School of Mlusketry" at Hythe. Our purpose in so doing was not confined to the illustration of the subject immediately under review, but extended to "ertain ulterior points of the utmost importance to military science. In a few words, we may state that the capacities of firearms recently discovered, and stHil perhaps but imperfectly fathomed, appearr likely enough to effect a complete revolution in the system of tactics, if not in the operations of war. It is for the cognizance of these inventions, and for the improvement of the opportunities thus presented, that the Hythe School has been established, and the account which we shall now subjoin of some of its latest proceedings will soon show the scope and consequence of the studies pursued. Before entering, however, upon these details we may briefly premise a general view of the problems propounded, of the sphere to which experiments have been limited, and of the direction which they have hitherto taLen. It is to be observed that the changes in progress, wonderful as they are, have not originated in any one remarkable or comprehensive discovery, introducing new agencies, or superseding those known for generations past. Although the increase of power obtained is absolutely tremendous, and although, as far as concerns the range and force communicable to a projectile, the instrument now manufactured presents as great an advance upon the old firelock as the fireloclk did upon the crossbow, the variation consists whoUy in small scient fie modifications. Common, old-fashioned gunpowder, neithermorenorlessexplosivethanformerly, is still the substance in use ; the weapon employed is still caUed by its old name of musket, or rifle, nor would it, indeed, even in its latest and most approved proportions, be easily distinguishable to a careless eye from that carried 50 years ago. The scope of improvement has been confined entirely to the elimination of waste and to the economy and concentration of power. The object has been to make every grain of poowder perform its proper duty of propulsion in forcing the hardest and the heaviest possible piece of metal through a barrel so formed as to give it the greatest possible length and accuracy of range. In the old musket half the force of the charge was wasted, or worse than wasted, for it actually contributed to the deviation of the bullet from its proper line of flight. In the manufacture of the new weapons it has been found that the inside of the barrel should not be smooth, as in the case of the old musket, nor grooved after thefashion of the old rifle, and that the spherical form is not the best for the projectile, but the bullet and the bore are so adapted to each other as to secure the mxaimum of effect and the minimum of error. In these simple and gradual improvements the new system of firearms has originated. To take a popular, though not entirely adequate ilustration of the change, the reader may compare one of the old parlour fire grates, consuming a bushel of coal at a time and sending ninetenths of the heat up the chimney, with a good stove, warming every corner of a room at less than half the cost in fuel. We shall now be more readily comprehended in our record of some of the last experiments at Hythe. The weapon recently supplied to our troops is the new rifle, called after the place of its manufacture-a Government establishment at EnfieldI and the efficacy of this arm was to that of the old musket pretty nearly as 20 to 1. But during the last week or two the Enfield rifle has been challenged and encountered by a competitor in the shape of a rifle devised by Mr. WHrrWonrT, and in some of the principal points of excellence it has been completely surpassed. As regards range, the VHiTwoRTH rifle actually sent its bullet into a target at a distance considerably exceeding a mile (1,880 yards) with measurableresults, while the Enfield rifle made no hits at even 1,400 yards. As regards accuracy, the WHvwonRTH was nearly as good at 1,100 yards as the Enflieldat 500, and when both were fired at 500 yards the shooting of the former was three times as good as that of the latter. As regards force, the ball from the Enfield weapon, charged with only the regulation quantity of powder, did certainly penetrate 12 planks of elm, each half an inch thick, in succession-a performancoe which, but for comparisons, might be thought both respectable and sufficient. When, however, the WHrrwoRTr rifle was tried, under precisely tho same conditions, it positively drove its bullet through tJree-and-thirty of these planks, and the misile was only then stopped by a solid block of oak behind. There can be no doubt, therefore, that on these points-points evidently of the greEitest importance in the estimation of a firearm-the new regulation weapon, excellent as it is, has been beaten by one still better; but other considerations of no small weight would remain to be balanced in completing a comparison between the two. It does not follow that the beast rifle for shooting quietly at a Mark will be the beat for the service of an army. The weapon thus far superior may be so apt to get out of order, so difficult to repair, so hard to load, or so generally .ill-calculated for rough and rapid use, as to be inferior on the whole. Even weight has much to do with the question, for the soldier has to carry his cartridges as well as his rifle. In this respect, also, the advantages of the Enfield weapon over the old musklet were. remarkable, the charge of the latter being 4 drachms of powder, whereas that of the former *as but 2j. The WaiTwoarn rifle is upon an equality with the Enfield, we presume, as regards charge; how it fares in the other conditions desirable we are not informed. What is obvious, however, in all these proceedings is, that military strategy must be raente with iomething very like an entie revolutions. T0 mucket carried by infantry soldug a }jihftawd been a weapon wlhich coul not be relied upon. for much execuition even at 100 yarda distance; it may now be a fatal 'Weapo at fully 10 times th range; and A* shorter distances it will send-bullets throug half-inch plates of iron, or through s inclxeW otsolid timber. A battalion, therefore, or codW - of an advancing enemy might be ripped through': and through by these terrifio projectils, aid sucht formations would become obsolete, A quetion, too, of analogous impotac must inevitably rr sent itself. Are these principles of oo -trucjon-. I and improvement applicable to artillery as wall as small arms? If they are, what will be the onsequence to our syatems of fortification t If they are not, or only partially so, how are gunnes t. stand by their pieces in the field against infantq dispersed in slkirmishing order, and armed witlweapons which deal out death at more than 1,000 yards' distance? One of our correspondentathinU that the fatality of these bullets as represented on the practice-ground will be considerably diminished by all the disturbing incidenta of red.. service, and in the mere fact he is no doubt. right; but this calculation can hardly affect the relative, though it may the actual, value of mnuketry. Precipitation and nervousness were always natural contingencies; they affectd the use of the old firelock, and they will affecl the iuse o the new rifle; but the comparison between thQ *wo weapons will be as stiling as before-indeed, we. can hardly suppose but that the conviction of superiority arising from, the se of the new we&pon; would tend to confirm the steadiness of those w ho carried it. On one point we may certainly congratulate ourselves, and that is on our poesion of ans establishment like that at Hythe, where aU the questions successively suggesting themselves in thix matter can be brought without delay to a practical trial and solution. There is no reason for our imbibing anything but confidence from the progrems of invention. Eventually the result must be precisely what we desire, in rendering a small but perfectly armed force a match for one numerically stronger but leus formidably equipped.
An Emigrant Ship arrives in about three inonthM at Australia, it contain on the average about 340 emigrants, and its average tonnage is above 'OO.' Here, then, we have the room, the number ,of people contained-in it, and the length of time thby are in this nautical prison. Observe that they Are not .iailors, but landmnen, pasing from one sphere of agriculture to, another, many of them from the inland counties, many probably who have never seen the sea before in their lives. Then there is a mixture of all ages and conditions-marriedmen and families, single men, and single women. It is not surprising if over a quantity of people torn up from their native soil, and wholly unaccustomed to confinement, discipline is rather diffcult when they are thus packed together, as tight. as they can fit, in an Emigrant Ship for three months. And we gather from a blue-book of "Despatches relative to Immigration into the Aug"tralian Colonies" that this is the case. Tbhe Adelaide " Immigration Agent"-it must be remembered that emigration here is immigration there-refers in his report to various cases of defective discipline. It appears that the surgeon is the maintainer of discipline in the Emigrant Ship. He has authority over the passengers as the captain has over the crew, and he finds his task a sufficiently hard one, especially in the matter of cleanliness. It is most difficult to make the emigrants attend to this duty, or make them understand that the same licence which is unwholesome and unbecoming in a cottage is fatal in so thick a mass of humau life as is contained in an Emigrant Ship. The surgeon is not always able to control his charge in this important matter. He may be a respectable man, and know his profession, but if he wants strength of mind he fails here, and, particularly if he allows his authority to slumber for the first two or three days of the voyage, he can hardly ever recover his lost ground. The consequence of this laxity is certain pestilence in the Emigrant Ship, and a high rate of mortality during the voyage. There are other departments of discipline in the Emigrant Ship, and the surgeon has to keep a vigilaut eye over the rising flirtations between the clames denominated in the stern language of the logbook " single men" and " single women." No sentiment is allowed on board the Emigrant Ship; a man may select the future partner of his labours in the new world to which he is bound, but he must keep the selection a profound secret till the end of the voyage, and trust to the operation of a magnetic sympathy for the revelation of his choice to the object of it. The " Immigration " Board" at Adelaide sat upon the conduct of an officer of the ship who had " paid attentions' to one of the single girls. It was proved that his intentions were quite honourable, and that the parents, who were also eniigrants on board, accepted him as their future son-in-law ; but " the " Board was of opinion that such intimacies should "not be allowed to exist on board ship, as they "tended to show a bad example to the crew, ana "were otherwise calculated to undermine disci"pline and interfere with the authority of the "Surgeon Superintendent." So stern a disciplinarian is the Surgeon Superintendent, at whose bybernal approach " nods and winks and wreathed "smiles" fly in dismay. We are glad to observe that the room and accommodations of the Emigrant Ship are increasing. The Melbourne " Immigration Re"port" notices the " improved general health of "the emigrants landed, which may be attributed "in a great measure to a superior class of ships, "carrying fewer passengers, and on ona deck "only," and concludes with the summary statement, that " it may now be considered an esta"blsbed fact that the larger the ship the shorter will be the passage and the less the mortality." Besides the larger size of the vesels, the accommoclations are improving. The Dirago baked four times a-week, " which was sufficient to supply " the emigrants with soft bread twice a-week.," As this seems to have been an unusually uccessful baking experiment, we will state, for the benefit of the emigrating public, and that it may not lose the least information on so important an article, that " the yeast used was made by using what the sur" geon called porter bottoms, and answered well." Another very important article in the Emigrant Ship is the bedding. The cotton of which it is composed " absorbs and retains moisture, causing "an offensive and unhealthy smell, andlong before "the end of the voyage gets into hard knotty "lumps. At the same time the floor of each "bed-place is made of deal, which does not allow "the escape of the-moisture caused by perspiration." The result of this is a vitiated atmosphere. The arrangement suggested instead removes both the cotton bed and the deal bed-place underne4ht. and substitutes for the former a double blaXiket to lie on, and for the latter " a piece ofLcanvams "which could be hooked on or Uk i at "plessure"-in taen away a " pleaure-in fact, a sort of hanitiock. " The "bed clothes, the blankets, and the sackiAng "forming the floor could thus be taken on deck every morningi and exposed to the air."' We must, however, ezpresstbefore quitting his part of the sibjedt, soi n s eurprise t the :ate of mortality on oad Emiiigrant S;hips in caes wthre l[there is iicill-managemnent to accout forit.- Thus, |one ahip 'which arrived perfectlyr ClIba i

THE NIO1ITINGALE FUND.-The subscription set on foot to form a fund as a record of the national gratitude to Miss Nightingale is about to close. A meeting of the *committee is to be held on Friday to prepare a report upon the subject, so that all who desire to express their sympathy and respect for this heroic woman should do so withoult delay. Sir Alexander JCockburn (L.ord Chief Justice of {he Court of Common Pleas) paid a visit to Southampton -on Saturday, and wa s ontertained at dinner in the evening by the Chamber of Commerce, the members for the Isborcugh and three of the county nmembers being among the Lompany.

CWOSBY-tALr,. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-lty attention has been drawn to an article in %ze 2imcs of the 22d inst, avowedly an extract from the Build. -rg News. It speaks of exertons being made to purchase the lease of Crosby-place, but, from not specifying the par. ticular puroose in view, has apparentl caused a misappre. hension rhich threatens to afect inutrlously the attempt to preserve that venerable relio as weUl as another still rore important object. lb is proposed to raiso a sumn of 6,000 guineas to put the evening classes for young men in a safe and permanent condition, by paying off the debt accumlated during the ilne years of their existence, and by purchasing a home for them, so that they may for the future be self-supporting. ilitherto they have occupied these premises, but they are now oflored for sale; an if the present favourable opportunity be not embraced there wsill be the risk of dispersing a well-cemented band of 1,000 intelligent andself-improving youths, and abandoning them to the dangerous temptations of a seductive city. If, on the otherhand,thebuildin shall be safe in the hands of the trustees for educational pturposes, it will be available for kindred societies and many other uses much wanted in London,-as a trade museum, a mercantile and maritime college, or a niLddle school for tradesmen's sons. These considerations, in addition to regard for its historical associations and arebitectural beauty, have in. duced the attempt to preserve Crosby-place from the hammer of the auctioneer, and retain it for its present tenants; but, suppesing tho negotiation for the lease were to fail, at least a fund would be raised which would form an endowment and set the institstion free of rent. To effect this desirable object several eminent statesmen, bishops, merchants, and societies have promised contributions, and these already, when added to she sub3crintio3s of the young men themselves, approach 2,00W. In the hops that the corporation of the city of London, as the trustees of a publio purse, as the chief guardians of apprentices, and as comprising many employers of young men, would have taken the same view, they were petitioned for aid ; but the petition was yesterday rejected. How to account for this I know not, but I am led to suspect that the article already alluded torn m 27 Times of the 22d so pre-occupied their minds with the idea of saving Crosby-hall (which, after all, is better worth preserving than Temple-bar) that they forgot the great causo of generil secular education, on which at times they discourse so elo. quently, and were unduly apprehensive lest they should put money into the hands of the proprietors of the building. It becomes, therefore, important to diabue the pubic mind of such au idea The proprietors, or rather lessees, are perfectly distinct from the evening classes, and, In proof of how little such imputation is deserved, have generously consented to sell their property to this institution for 7504 less than they will take for it from any other party. Surely, if there had not been some misunderstanding, the majority of those present in the corporation yeterday would not have ignored the claims of an institution which does its best to supply the deficiencies long since deplored in this metropohs-viz., those of a public library, reading room, classes, and suitable lectures at a moderate price; which, by providing the comforts of a club, educational appliatoes, and sympathetic friendship, secures the rational recreation aud moral training of the youth of London, and obvlates the evUls that have been apprehended by some from the early closing movement. Believing, therefore, that something you have published has, however undesignedly, tended to this unfortunate result, I venture to ask for the insertion of these few lines to prevent further mischief.

THEx LATE Sr RonBET PEEm.-On Friday evening the Mayor of Tamworth, Mr. C. B. Hamnel, gave an entertainment to a numerous company at the Town.halU, Tamworth, the occasion being the presentation of a copy of Sir Thomas Lawrence's portrait of the late Sir Robert Peel to the town. The artist is Mr. Wood, who was a pupil of Sir Thomas Lawrence, asnd great satisfaction was expressed at the maDner in which the portrait has been executed. Sir Robert Peel, in presenting the portrait briefly adverted to the services rendered to the nation by his late father, and said that, as his successor, he hoped constantly to keep his father's meritsbhe!ore his eyes. In giving the portrait to the Mayor, as the ropresentative of the town of Taimworth, he felt that he was but paying a compliment to those who had so often honoured his father with their political confidence. The AMayor, in returning tbanks for the portrait, deseanted upon the great abilities and disinterested patriotismn of the late baronet. Alluding to the bronze statue erected six years ago in front of the Town-hal] he observed that a gentleman, who warmly sympathizea with the object of those who proposed to erect that monument, told them they had made a mistake-that they might have succeeded in getting a good marble bust, but that a small and poor population oould not possibly raise the 700!. or 8001. which a bronze statue would require. "That gentleman," said Mr. Hamel, "knew more of the emptiness of our pockets than of the depth of our feelings. We raised 1,1001 n subscriptions varying from 601. to Id., everybody being anxious to share in the work." FiRE AT ALDERSHOTT.-On Saturday the troops in Aldersbott Camp were suddenly aroused by the alarm of fire being raised. It appears that while the men were actively enaed m the bakery they were astonishedatseeingan unmal body of flame in one of the buildings connected with the bakery, usedas stores. An instantalarm of "fire" was raised. which was re-echoed through the ranks, and in a very brief space of time the troops were ordered out and a brigade of firemen attended with their engine. It was then found that nothing short of the most strenuous exertions of those on the spot could save the surrounding buildings. With as little delay as ossible the engines were set to work under the superintendence of the comrnanding oflicers, but in spite fe combioed exertions of all present the work of devastation continued.

DR3ATH OF -B. JOHN 2 M GBEG0R We have to record the death of Mr. Johti M'Gregor, at Boulogne, on Thursday, the 23d inst. He had been for some months past deciniL; in health-oppremed by pcunry difficl- ties; and gn:nfully involved in the fall of the Royal. British Bank, oI wr7ich he had been the original " governor." He had resigned that office three years previous to its recent bankruptcy, but the, late disclosures as to the msmana rement of the institution, and his own coniderabiae and unsecured debt to the unfortunate shareholders, overwhelmed a shattered body and a wounded spirit. A bilious fever and paralytic affection, we believe, terminated his physical and mental sufferings. Our respected Consul, Mr. Hamilton, Idndly afforded M,Pt. nr -'9'.r "- e-e -.. ^ and medical -_ ..r- -, iY ecesaary. _..... se attention, and for the previous week his brother watched over his deathbed. Notwitbstanding the later clouds on M1r. I''Gregor's reputation, and ks errors and foibles, he was an intelligent, amiable man, of no common mind, of extraordinary powersof application, and his active public life and his numerous published works justly entitle him to notice in our columns. Mr. John M'Gregor was a Scotehman by birth, parentage, and educatioiu He was born at Stornoway, Rosashire, in 1797. We believe that at an early age, enjoying only an ordinary school teaching, he was placed in a mercantile establishment in the Canadas, where he continued several years. During that period, and afterwards when in business on his own account, he visitod, and became intimately acquainted with, the colonies of North America on the Atlantic and within the Gulf of St. Lawrence. He was afterwards in btsiness in Liverpool. His mercantile speculations were there unfortunate, and, indeed, rarely at any period of life successful. He first became known as an author by the publication, in 1832, of two octavo volumes, entitled British America, published by Blackwood and Cadell. This work reached a second and improved edition in the following year. It was not only at the period highly interesting, but it abounded in facts and statistics, and it 'displayed a large comprehension of our future colonial interests. It may even now be consulted with advantage. On Mr. M'Gregor's enforced retirement from business, his object in life seems to have been some employment in the public service. Accordingly, during Lord Melbourne's Ministry we find him engaed on commercial missions to Germany, Austria, Pans, and Naples. We need not particularize his multifarious reports, or comment on their indisputable merits or shortcomings. It will be sufficient to state that his missions were generally well performed-that they advanced *sound principles of political economy, and that on the whole the product wa5 worth the cost to the public fxchequer. In 1835 hep_ublished My Note Book, dedicated to his friend Sismondi. This work was chiefly a personal narrative of his tours on the continent. It was an amusing contribution to the stock of our circulating libraries, interspersed with some instructive notices of the social habits of our continental neighbours. Curiously, a note in the first volume details the ruin of the old bank of Amsterdam, instituted in 1689 as a bank of deposit-" broken byan inconvenient mode of transferring sums from the account of one individual to another," and by the directors secretly lending and " locking up" 10,000,000 forins to the provinces of l{olland and Friesland, notwithstanding its original constitution bound the directors to have bullion in their coffers equal to the amount of its liabilities. This old story might have saved our author from much misconduct of the Royal British Bank. But theory and praotice are different affairs. These literary labours and occasional public commis3sions ultimately led to Mr. 3'Gregor's appointment to a permanent place in the Board of Trade, and he became one of the two joint-secretaries of that important public department in January, 1840. Thus installed in Whitehall, he lost no time in agitating for Free Trade. We 'oelieve that, with the late James Deacon Hume and George Richardson Porter, he chiefly induced Mr. Joseph Hulae to force upon the House of Commons the appointment of the celebrated Select Committee on the Import Duties of the United Kingdom; the report of Which, after only 10 days' sitting, sealed the fate of our superannuatedtariff. The "'power to send for persons, papers, and records " ransacked the Board of Trade and let loose the tongues of the joint-secretaries. Mr. M'Gregor was, of course, the first witness summoned. His examination exclusively occu. pied the entire first two days, and portions of the third and fourth days. It baa been the fashion to say' that he "lied through his testimony." The imputation is untrue. His doXntic confidence of opnion, with an occasional reckless statement, gave indeed a colour to this accusation, but the only resourme of his opponents was unfairly to discedit his important evidence; and, the Protectionists not producing any counter-evidence, thi4 slander was their only alternative. Bat any dispamionate reader will now give credit to the general and valuatble evidence of Mr. WGregor. Further, he was confirmed by the more reliable evidence of Deacon Hlume and Porter, to say nothing of the corroborative testimony of some of our most eminent city and provincial merchants and manufacw turers. The elation of Mr. M'Gregor thenceforwards knew no bounds. He wasexalted in his own ima'ination to the fifth heaven. Vanitywas one of tie passions which poor John M'Gregor, from an unfortunate nature and habit, could not control; and the abuse of it was, in truth, his worldly ruin. It made him often the laughingstock even of his intimate friends, and in later years he perambulatedthe Clubs, unconscious of the general ridicule of his vaingloriousness. This inordinate self-valuation involved him in the firm persuasion that from his secondary office in the Board of Trade he should at once vault to a seat in Lord John Russell's new Cabinet. He intimated this certain conviction to all his friends and acquaintances. In this dream he resigned his office of 1,5001. per' annum, and having pre-arranged his plans he became a candidate for the city of Glasgow in July, 1847, opposing the old Liberal members, Mr. Oswald and Mr. John Dennistoun. unfortunately for himself, he headed the poll. We need not enlauge on the utter failure of his absurd aspirations, or on the bore and jest of his occasional exhibitions in the House of Commons. He did not appear to discover his failure, much Iess to feel its humiliation; nor, to do him justice, did he relax in his statistical and intellectual pursuits. In 1847 he had produced two huge crown octavo volumes, historical and statistical, on T1e Progress of Amerlca from the Discovery bly Columbts to the Year 1846, comprising 3,000 pages. This work was no sooner off his anvil than he published four large volumes of similar Pize, entitled Commercial Statistics. These volumes, in bulk upwards of 4,000 pages, all rapidly appeared between the years 1848 and 1850. In 1852 he published two octavo volumes, entitled T7he History of te British Emire jromn the Accion of James L. Nor were these voluminous works at al the largest product of his active mind. Earlier in life, in the Canadas, he had prepared reports on North American emigration, on the Newfoundland fisheries, and on similar Transatlajitic subjects: and we lave to add' to his home prodactions 22 RBports on Foreign Tarsffs and Trade, presented to Parliament by Royal command. To be added to this summary of 'his labours are numerous pamphlets on subjects of the day, and an extent of private political and statistical correspondence at home and abroad almost incredible. On the subject. of the Royal British Bank, which he established, Mr MsGregor vwould take no counsel, or if he promised to abide by any friendly advice he was sure to relapse to his own opinion of his entire self-sufficiency. The end i3 but to well known. Such is the melancholy history of a man of hig7 intellectual powers, energy, and indusy, 'who might have secured for himlf wealth, honour, and old age. We almost reluctantly thus portray his full character, but such a narrative was due to society, and Mr. M'Gregor was a public man. He had not a single qualification for the governorship of a bank, as he confessed in the singular letter in which he promised to make a future explanation of his ad- ministration of its affairs. Webelieve that he was more a nominal than an active mawger in the 'chair. No friend would attempt to excusa hsi assumption of duties which he opuj not or wold not dischArge; nor can ther, be.' offered awy extenuation . of his appropriain ot the as3 eFIOaente4 by his own l rivawkgqs a ijo to tbb2eWders.

Lord Zetland's Vedetto and Lord Londesborough's Ket are the leadiL z fvrourite, and the general opinion is that they will be as close together in the rAce as they re in the betting. VedetWs claims to support are not founded on any partioular display of racing ability on the horsa'q part but rest on the recent achievements of hi stable companion Skirmisher, and the supposition of Vedetes being the better horse of the two. Vedette ia not in the Derby, for which raceLordZetlaud'sinterestwilibe represented by Skirmiaher. lKent is to all intents and purposes what is technlall;y alled a "darkhorse."

The Baron, however, seems to have great confidence in Sydney, and it has been remarked that it remains to be seen who klnoWg most about the horso, he or the bettingmen.

Russell, will commence the delivery of a personal narrative of that campaign in the Crimea which he so vividly described in our columns throtughout the exciting period of its progress. The narrative is to consist of three parts,-the second and third to be iespectively delivered on the 14th and 16th of May,and will comprise every event of importance from the departore of the army to the evacation of the Crimea. According to the prospectus, many subjects which could not havebeen judicioualy communicatedto theworld during the continuance of the war will be described for the first time in the lectures, and a comprehensive sketch will be given of the private life and interior economy of the armies and the camp.

The Arrogant was the pioneer of the new system, which has gone on improving in succeSs with each attempt under the present scientific xnd practical constructive department of the na and under the surveyor-generalship of Sir Baldwin Walker.

Whichan only be obtained after yeas of hd serie an upo n proof tkat its recipient ba paed through the logwgrades of his profession wint a high churaer, shoul hw lookedupon asapropertyof which a nunoughtnot tobedeprivedon light grounds, and tUat any tribunalbefore whick ti after ooaduct may be arrsigned, and upon whosedectlog that deprivation may rest should be one composed of mesL fully versed in nautical matters, and a ble to form a am opinion in respect of tbos technical difficulties which certain to present themselves more or les prominently in. the course of an investigation of the eircumstances attendIng the los of a ship or any minor acdent. But how is this tribunal at present constitnted ? It eonsisk.either of a stipendiary magistrate, or two justice or the peace, with the addition, " in eae wher ntical skilL and knowledge are reqaired" (in what ca would they noo be required ?).of an " aseeseor" appo intea by the Boad et Trade. Now, the stipendiary magistrate would probably have been brought up for the bar, and of thetrwo juiloec ene would most likely be a clergymn a ad the other a halfpay military offlicer, a country gentleman, or a retire& mbchant, all mostexoeUent and est imable men, and per. feotly competent to dispoae of all the cases of trivial aault and -petty larceny that come before a bench of m3gistates but ninetimes out of ten wholly deficient of I knowledje of nautical matters. The assessor of the B oard of Trade therefore becomes invested with powers of the most aritrb description; he supplies khe place of judge and jur, the report to the Board of Trado, which is in fact, the sea-- tence, is his report; the trial has been t he trial of one mae by one man-- state of tbings which is not paralleled in azy of the judicial institutions of the country. In some other professions-the medical, for example-..a diploma obtained only, a in ours, after years spent in the acquisition of practical and theoretical knowledge is requi site; life hangs upon the degree of skll, judgment, an( nerve displayed by the surgeon called upon to perform a difficult operation on a sidden em ergency. With us life in constantly at stake under similar conditions, but in th* event oC misfortune or accident how differently are we dealt wltNl The Royal College of Surgeons have no power to send down an asessor to inquire into the performancet - the operation, and, if dissatisfied with his report, to sused or canel the diploma of the operator. The comparimo might be pursued further, nd extended to other profemions always to our disadvan tage; but I muast nottrespss onyolir bce. In addition to the responsrbilities connected with tha Merchant Shipping Act, the commander is liable to criminal prosecution in the event of life being lost by his wrongfu actor neglect, and the o ommanders of mail temen partl cularly are, in the exoaution of the postal contracts, fr_ quently placed in such circumstanoes that they fnd the authorities under whom they act in decided opposition to each other. It must not he understood that we deprecate Inquiry altogether; on the contrary, an inquiry before a tribunal tboroughly competent woald oft=n clear our cearacts and set us right before the world after an accident. But we de hold that the tribunal, as it present composed, is not com_ petent, that the Merchant Shipping Act requires thorough revision and amnendment, and that the different depart. mentsof the Government-namely, the Admiralty, the Post- lEce, and the Board of Trade, ought not to conflict in th euties they impose on, Sir, Your obedient servant.

FOBBI&N INTELLIGENCE. .FKA-N VZ- 0-i *tThe following apreared In our owna ealdon of sa t -rd&y-1 _ (FRom OUR OWN COVOXD.) PARIS, APRiL 24, 6 P.M. I mentionedyesterday that theFrench Governm'ent had received despatches of an unpleasant deswrip. tion from Jassy. It appears that the Commissoners have anived there, but that they are not quite agreed in opinion. Two of them? we are told, disapprove the conduct of the Moldavian Government, two Sut port it, and one neither approvesnorcondemns. Zn the meantime the Umnom3t Committee of holdavia has sent hwo of its membera to France to make complaInti on the part of the Union. The French Go-. vernment, whose article in the Monitcur was, in strictness, the fiIst violation of the neitrality that ought to have been observed on the question, cannot blame very se rerely its violation by the Kaimakan, who merely improves on the example set him. I also announced, on the authority of a letter from Jasay, that some persons had been arrested by the authorities merely for, having propounded opinionD favourable to the union, to which the Moldavian Government is hostile. The following protest against this arbitrary act has been addressed to the foreign Consuls in the Principalities *- "Messieurs les Consuls,-We are, to our gret regret, driven to the necessity of bringing to your knowledge a fact which, In the preseat rcumstancs, is most uignifitant, and which is of a nature to intimidate and dis courage the minds of our population. M. Tomunlitz, Pro. lemor at the Pablia School of the Faubourg of Tatk. rash, and hI Confrarenco, proprietor, Boyard, and formerly Semtuy ofL the Kmunioipality, both elector3 of the city of Ja.sy, have been arrested on acooult of their poltioal opinions. They were removed this morning from .,their domicile by the Vice-Aga, the Commissary of the qArter,snd several Gendarmes. - They -twre taken befora the Minlster of tho Interior, who insulted them grossy, calling them ' wretched and ' brigands ot UnIonists,' and threatening to put them in irons. At this moment they are lodged in the prison of the polce. A"brother of M. Confrarence lAving accompaniod him before the Minister, the latter reDeled him also with threats, which, indeed, he addresod to 11 who savocated the union of the Principalities. "In consequence of such conduct, whleh violates indivldua liberty and treats opinion a a crime, the under. igned feel it their duty to brlng befote you, praing you ;to ommunicate it to your respective Governments, as also to tfe Commisioners, a&tto of things so opposed to our Lws, mndto the guarantees w*hi&h are accorded to us by the Trety of Paris. The Government has evidently renounced lis mission of impartiality, and the Holdavians haie every. thing to fear from the system whic has been entered upon. If s'ach a system be tolerated'the guarantee demanded by the Congress for the free expression bf our wishes wonid; be only empty words. How, we ask, can the freedomn of opinion-a freedom sanctioned even by the firnuan convoking the Divans-coexist with the siolatiot of personl liberty? How can the electors come to an understanding among themselves, interchange their opinions, and agree as to the candidates they are to select, when they find them., selves exposed to outrages and [to threats of incarcertion? The country is calm: this fact canhot be denied. Moldavia, grateful for the benevolence of the great Powe is trannlly preparing for the elections; but when we =ritne the Dlegal conduct of the present Administratlonweare usified in supposing that it wishes for disorder. "We invoke, then, the stipulations of the Treaty of, Pads; ve place the freedom of our opinions under the protecSion of the flags of your respetve nations who have subscribed to that guarantee, and we implore -ou, MM. les Consls, to be pleased to adopt the most efficacous mnean of putting an end toa state of tbinp so centrary to the rlghts of the country, to the promises which have been made to it, nd to that which is at this momentaasinng in Wallachia under the eyes of the great European COdmi-on " We take the present opportunity of praying Ton, MM. les Consuls, to accept the asurance of the disinguished consideration with whichwe have thehonour to rema=," &a. (Signed by several of the inhabitants of Tassy.) The Secretary of the Ottoman Embassy left Paris this morning for Constantinople on a misson. The Moniteur is remarked as barren of intelligence about the movements of the Grand Dike Constantine. It may be to avoid giving umbrge, or it may be to make amends for the notverydignfoed joy with which the prospect of a visit from the Grand Duke was caught at. As I mentioned would be the case, Prince Napoleon has not gone to receive him, as originally intended. The Grand Doke will not, it is said, visit Marseilles before the 27th. Therm is a great deal to be seen at Toulon, and the Rusisin Grand Duke appears determined to see everything. A letter from Totilon, of the -22d inst., says that on Monday night, after the arrival of the Grand Duke, an experiment with the electrd light was made by MM. Lacassagne and Thiers on the platform of the Lambert Tower, behind the Mourillon. The light was remarkable for its uniform brightness. It lighted the fleet and the entire harbour so completely that officers returning ashore could read i their boats. The experiment was repeated on Tuesday night, and is to be continued. At dinner was given at the P'refecture on the 21st, to which the StafE officers were invited. On Wednesday morning the Grand Duke again visited the dockyard, and vnth much attention exaamined the construotion of the new gunboats. He appears to be indefatigable in the gratification of his curiosity, and he remarked to Captain Paris, of the Auxtdacseuse, when complimenting him on the excellent condition of his frigate, "I am impatient to have done with these official receptions, in order that we may more carefully ex e together your ships and your dockyards." At 2 o'clock the Duke embarked in the Imperial barge, and proceeded to the dockyard of La Seyne, two miles from Toulon. le was invited for the evening to an extraordinary performance given by the Municipality at the theatre of Toulon. The opera to be performed was Les Mousquetaires de la Beine. The Duke is to prolong his stay in Toulon till Monday. He wishes to visit the fine Hospital of St. Mandrier at the op posite side of the harbour. St. ManAnon, founded 30 years ago, contains 900 beds, oocupied at present b only 250 invalids. One of the most Interesting ojects in this large establishment is a cistern to receive the rain, and which holds an immense quantity of water. Its form is that of an immense horseshoe 80 yards long and 15 wide. The depth of the water is about 15 feet. When it overflows, the surplus water is received in a second cistern. In the gardens behind the hospital are to be seon the palmtree, catus, aloes, and various other African productions. A French Government agent is about to proceed to Parma for the purpose of watching the intrgues said to be going on there. Austria, I suppose, is the party suspected, and her action is felt in the petty States of Italy, including even the almost imperceptible republic of San Marino. A letter from Milan of the 20th inst. informs us that the new Governor-General of the LombardoVenetian Provinces made his solemn entranoe into the capital on the 19th. The hour chosen for his arrival was that when the streets are most crowded. The reception, nevertheless, was rather cold, and the Archduke Maximilian, who is saidtobeof a quick and penetrating mind, could not be mistaken as to the feelings of the Milanese population on that occasion. The appeal in the affair of the Napoleon Docks came on yesterday before the Cour Imp6riale. AL Cusin, who was condemned to three years' imprisonmentand 5,000f. fine * M. Legendre, to12 months' imprisonment and 2,000f. fine; A. Berryer, to two years' imprisonment and 5,000f. fine; and AL Dachesne de Vere, to six months' imprisonment and 2,000f. fine, appealed against their sentences. The public prosecutor, on his part, appealed against the acquittal of M. Orsi and against the sentence on M Csin, as too lenient. All the accused persons appeaed before the Court, which was presided over by M,~ Sangiacomi. MI. Perrot do hasiaeles made the report o n the affair, after which the President commenced interrogating the accused. No fresh incident arose, the replies of M. Cusin and M. Legendre being to the same effect as on the previous triaL The proceedings were adjourned to the next dav.

'Bit the, world moves, even in America; for it is an :or;to believe that it is Inall things as progressive asiits -"go-a-head" reputation. In some matters t,hre is vast amount of inertia, and an obstdnate cifuglng to what have become actual evils. Life is rapid,:and there is a8lmost an excess of motion, but is not alwaysJ,forward. The changes are more those of increase and expansion than renewal-in. crease of wealth and growth, of territory; but in the old centres there is a good deal of what elsewhere would be caUed Toryism. There is a " vested interest" in abuses, and they are defended to the last. ! The -inquest on the victims of the fatal cataa' trophe at the Des Jardins-hridge, on the Toronto and Hamilton Railroad (Canada West), has terminated. The jury found that the cause of the accident was the brealdng of the axle of the engine, by which the whole train was thrownL off the rails just as it was pasing on to the bridge. The structure was strong,enoughto support any train as long as it kept on the line,but being thrown on one side,the engine and carriage tore up and brole through the plank-work and plunged into the deep canal below. The jurors recommend the erection of a permanent bridge, with separate tracks over it for the Great Western and Toronto, lines; thev also recommend the renewal of the law coapelling trains to stop before passing on to all bridges like that at which the terrible accident occurred.
EXTAORDIINAY PisOouO DING.-On Wednesday nightisA aboutan hour aitei midnight, Mi. Mitchell, a resdent at Sheeprldge, was awakened by a knock at the door of hishouse, and, thinklng the demand for adinittance c.no from a melber of his3 family, weilt down stafis and opened It, when in rmshed, withont explanation or Invitation, about 30 men, who at once proceoded to break open the door of an inuer room, which contined a couple of.machinesto be usedin s process for turnin ad curllng tle hair in the manufacture of mohair cloth. After examinin the machines and tfrning the handles three Or four times, ono of these unceremonious gmests cut an ,end off a plece lying near. An exclamation of " All d t" was then heard, and the Whole of the nasty lot tho house as summarily as they had entered it From what we can gather, the cause of this ettraordinary proceeding arose from the alleged infingement, by the constraction of these machines, of a patent belongingto Wr. Isi Beeardsel, of Hag who had a special agreement rith M1r. JohnBrigg, of auddersafeld, for the exclusie working of the patent. Mfr.

ZAW REPORT. COURT OF CH0ACERY. LINoLN's-INN. AruM 25. EX PARTE INBF :RT, IN RE LATHAM. (Before the LORDS J'UsTxcES of APPEAL.I This bankrupt petition wasa heard a few days ago, and then stood over for judgmesit. A house of business in Buenos Ayres purchased bills of a firm there whioh had drawn them on a firm in LiverpooL The foreign drawing house advised the Livorpool house of their having remitted bills to be applied in honouring the bills wbioh they had sold. Before the remittances arrived in England the Liver*pool house became bankrupt. The drawring firm and the Llverpool firm were aUeged to be identical i interest. Mr. rommissioner Stevenson held that the sasigsees were not bound to apply the remittances in discharge of so mnch of the bills as they would cover. The purchasers of the bills appealed. h There were other bills, but the ovidence was not sufficient Eas to them, and therefore no further m ention is imade of them. Mr. Bacon and Mr. ReRshaw supported the petition, Mr. Cairns and Mr. W. D. Griffith appeared for the assignees. Their LORDSIPSm were of opinion that, whetber the two firms were identical or not, there had been such an ap. *propriation of the remittances to the purpose of taking up the bills that the appellants were entitled to so much of the produce of those re mittances as would cover tbe bills, and direoted the order of the Commissioner to be varied accord. lmgly. They recommended a compromise of the matter so far as related to the other bills. Ex .ART HARPER, IN PE JONES. This case also stood in the paper for judgment. The facts already reported were that Messrs. Harper and Parry Jones entered into a renewed partnership, as solicitors, in 1843, to continue for their joint lives, and it was thereby agreed that on the death of either partner the survivor should pay an annuity to such person or persons as the other partner should appoint, to be paid half-yearly during the joint lives of the widow of the pre-deceasing partner and the surviving partner, or that the surviving partner should during the same time pay to such appointee or appointees one-tourth of the profits of the business. Mr. Harper, on his marriage, settled this annuity with ether property upon his intended wife. He died before 1851, and subsequently M r. 'Parry Jones became bankrupt, and Mrs Harper claimed to prove for the arrears of her annuity up to the bankruptcy, or for the value of the annuity, or that she might have an account of the profits. It appeared from Mr. Jones's affidavit and other evidence that Mr. Harper died very greatly indebted, together with his partner, npon the account of the partnership. Mr. Commissioner Balguy decided against the claim of the widow. Mr. Kenyon supported the appeal; Mr. Bacon and Mr. De Gex were counsel for the assignees; Mr. Charles Hall for the bankrupt. Their LoRDSlsus were of opinion that during the solvency of the surviving partner there had been no election on his part to pay the widow the annuity, and since the bankruptcy of MI. Parry Jones his assignees had elected otherwise. The questions then were whether the widow had a right of proof in respect of the share of the profit; whether the profits were of the business continued by the surviving partner or of later partnership, and whether the amount of debt due from the lsdy's husband to the partner. hip was to be taken into account against profits? Their Lordships thought that the profits were intended to be confined to those of the continued partnership, and that the d7ebt was to be set off against those profits, and that, that being so, the right of proof would be reduced to nothing, considering that the debt was of such great amount. The appeal was dismissed without costs. IN LUNACY. EM PARTE EVANS, IN RE PHILIP TAYLOR. This petition has been snore than once in the paper for hearing, but for various reasons has been postponed until now. The subject of the application is Mr. Philip Taylor, an old gentleman, a retired grocer and draper, who is possessed of considerable property and resides at Kirwan, in Glamorganshire, and its object is to place him under the care of the Court of Chancery as a person of unsound mind and incapable to manage his affairs. The petitioners are Mr. David Evans, of the same place, and Helen Eliza his wife, the niece of Mr. Taylor. The petition alleged that ever since April, 1856, he had been of unsound mind; that Mrs. Evans when 18 years of age, came to live with him (he being a widower), and so remained from 1841 to 1851, when sho married; but in 1847 and 1856 he executed wills leaving her the bulk of his property * that Mr. and Mrs. Evans lived with him from October, 1865, to September, 1856, after which they removed to a house next door, but all lived together as one family; that on the 5th of December, 1856, Mr. Taylor left and went to reside with Mr. and Mrs. David Williams in another part of Kirwan, the latter being a niece of the late Mlrs. Taylor. and that he on the same day was prevailed upon by them to execute a wii in favour of Mr. and Mrs. Wiliams, the gentleman first called in to write it having refused to do so on the ground of the teatator's incompetency. This petition was supported by many affidavits. The old gentleman had been exmined by seven medical men threeof vwhom pronounced him of unsound mind, and four declaring him perfeotl7 sane, but admitting him to be of impaired memory. In this state of the medical poll, thee being a majority of only one, the Iords Justices determine-l to send a physician en their own behalf, and Dr. Forbes Winslow was deputed to perform the delicate task of examining the supposed lunatic, and to report the result of his experience to the Court. That report, drted the 30th of M1arch last, concluded with this passage:- " I caeu detect no kind of alienation of affectlon In Mr. Taylor', mind. His memory Is defective, perhaps noro so than ig goseraUy the case at his age, and his. mind is occaaionally confused when questioned cleosl upon minute pointa of buineEs, ancd when suddenly - qguested without any aasistauce from hi, books and paper', to gve e =etaied account of hls somewhat cotnplioated propery, but this con. ceivo cannot be considered as satisfactory evldenco of mental uusoundnets such as to justify the applicatiors to the Court for a commission of Inquiry. It evldence siumar to this were generaly considtred ufflclent to warrant the protection of the Court of Ohancery on the plea of mental unsoundness, no aged man in the kingdom with a mesiory awnewhat impaired bh age or bodlly IaIrmity, would be safe from the .tIpicon of insanity and mental incapacity. During my tive long intervia withair.vTaylor I subjected hie mind toa moc3tr Id examina. tin, and appUed to his understanding all the well-establisbed tie's ith the view of thoroughly analyzing the sanity of bhs intellect, and. vith the exception of an impaired memory upon matters of account I could detect no one symotom that would justify the allegation of insanlty. I therefore have the honour to report to your Lordships that I am clearly of opinion that Mr. Philip Taylor is a cerson of sound mind and capable of managing himself and his afitirs. Mr. CAiRNS supported the petition. Mx. W. M. James and Mr. Freeing, who appeared for the alleged lunatio, were not called upon. Lord Justice K?NxGrrr BRucE.-Let the petition be dismissed. lord Justice TuliLSnc-Certainly. Mr. CAIRNs hoped their Lordships would see from the .affidavits that Mr. and Mrs. Evans only performed a daty in seeldng the protection of the Court for this aged relative. Had they not interfered. and anything serious had happened to him, they would have been blamed. ILord Justice KNIrGT BRUCE.-Well, it is no doubt very disareeable that an aged and wealthy uncle should saud donly-exhibit a preference for his wife's niece at the expense of his own. Thero is, however, no help for it. Aged and wealthy mien will be capricious. You have the old . gentleman's deeds. Will 7ou give them up? Mr. CAIRNS said his chent would deliver them to Mr. Taylor, but some person shouald be present to attest the fact. Lord Justice KNIGHT BRtucE.-Why should this invalid gentleman be troubled bhytwo sets of attorneys ? Mr. W. M1. J,ASIs.-Only to give some colour to the idea that he is not competent to receive and take care of the deeds. Lord Justice KLNIoiiT BRUCE.-Let the deeds be delivered upon the written receipt of Mr. Taylor. Our view of the evidence is such as that he is perfectly competeslt to give such a receipt. After some further discussion, the petition was dismissed without costs.
VTCT;CTHANVPRTT.TfORk fOTTRPUq A -, ox HARVEY V. HUME. (Before YwC-ChanCelOr Sb- J. STUAWr. I This was a bill praying that it might be declared that the defendants, Mr. W. 13. lume and his wife, were entitled to the guardianship,. custody, tuition, and management of the plaintiff during her minority, and that Mr. Hume might o directed to pay into court 6001., and that that sum.when paid into court might be invested in Consols, and the dividends thereon paid to the guardians or guardian of the plaintiff during her minority, pursuant to the trusts of a certain deed.

COTTRT OE QIJEENPS BENCH: WR2MnvRq A T A THE QUM2T V. ORADDOM. (&tings in Banco, beforc Lord CAMPBELL and JTwizm ERLE and CaompTON.) Mr. PAsnr.xv, Q.C., moved in this case for a rulet to quash the conviction, which had been brought up by certiorari. The question arose out of the dispute in the recentcase of "Swinfen v. Swinfen,'x in which the title to the Swinfen estate in Staffordshire was litigated. Thbjpaiinx tiff claimed the estate as devisee, and the defendant ias heirat-law. The latter had given permission to a terson to shoot on the property; but the plaintiff, Mrs. Ewinfen who was in poesession of the estate, chargedhimbeforethe magistrates with trespassing. The learned coinsel said the. magistrates would not hear the defencewhichthepaiy wished to make under the heir-at-law, and then convicted him without hearing his defence. The case was, therefore the same as if he had not been summoned. Mr. Justice EBRLJ said it must not be taken as clear ai6t the magistrates until -the other side had been heard. He bad a notion that the case was ratber different. Lord CAVAenJu said the learned counsel might talke a rule to show cause. Rule ni4i granted. E QUEEN V. THE JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT AT .NORWICH. Mr. PALAmEa moved for a rule for a prohibition to the judge of the County Court of Norfolk, held at Norwich, under these circumstances. A party had been sued in the County Court at Norwich, and on the 27th of June last judgment was given against him for 18h 4s. and costs. On the 9th of July the party petitioned the Insolvency Court, the petition was referred to the judge of the same County Court, and on the 27th of July an order was made by the judge for his discharge. It was declared that he was entitled to the benefit of the Insolvent Acts, and to be discharged from allhis debts, including that of the plaintiff; which was included in the schedule. On the 20tb of March last he was summoned before the judge to be exarmined as to his effects and means of aynimnt. He then urged that the debt was gone by his discharge under the Insolvent Acts; but the judge ultimately made an ordet for the payment of the debt by instalments. - One instalment was paid, as the party did not wish to be sent to prison, but hepaid it under protest, and now applied for a prohibition. The question to be dcided turned apon the effect to be given to the. 2d section of the 19th and2 0tli Victoria in repealing the last clause of -the 102d section of tlbe County Courts act, 9th and 10th Victoria, chap. 95.i Lord CA M PBAELL said the learned counsel might takce a Rule nisi granted. SDIONS V. PATCHETT. This *aa a rule to reduce the damagesto2501. The action was brought by a shipowner at Glasgow to recover damages for the breach of a contract into whichthe defendant bad entered for the purchase of a ship of ihe plaintiff for the sum of 6,000,', as agent for Messrs. Boston and C4. It appeared that it was a part of the contract that the plaitff should add a spar deck to the ship, which he accordingl , did, at an expense of 2501. It was subsequently ascrtaie that the defendant had no authority from Pis principal t p enter into that contract. The plaintiff then sold the shi for the sum of 5,7501., and brought the present action to recover the sum of 2501. as damages for the defendait's breach of contract, and the further suTm of 250. which be had been induced by the defendant to expend, ih fitting up the ship. At the trial, which took, place some time since, before Lord Campbell, the plaintr obtained a verdict for both sums; but this rule t; reduice the verdict to 2501. was subsequently granted. There was no question as to the plaintiff's right to recover thb 2501. for fitting up the dec ; the only question being as tb the rule by which the amount of damages for the breach of contract should be ascertained. MTr. H. EA¢rna Q.C., and Mr. MmwAriisB showred cause against the rule, and contended that the verdict had heei found for the right amount, the proper measure of damageb. for the breach of contract being the difference between the contract p rice and the price for which the ship was afterwards sold. ~ ~ ~ th ws ftr Mr. IL Smrm, Q.C., in support of the rule, contended that the plaintiff could only recover nominal damanges, an} likened the case to where a party sought to recover damages for non-fulfilment of a contract for the sale of an estate where the vendor was unable to complete his title, in which case he could only recover the expenses to which he hbad been put. Lord CAMPBEL said he thought the verdict ought to stand for 5001., on the ground that the defendant was answerable for the loss directly arising from his breach of contract. He represented tothe plaintiff that he was authorized byMessrs, Boston and Co. to enter into the contract, and that it was a contract binding on theim. Had tha been the case the plaintiff -would have had a claim Upon themfor the twos smsof2501, ;andheought nowto be place In the same situation as if the contract- had been fuIfiJJa. If there had been a fall in the market the plaintiff could have recovered from the purchaser the difference betweezi the price at the sale and at the resale; and his Lordship thought the jury in this case might have considered that the vessel was resold at the market price, and that their verdict might be supported on that ground. The rule contended for by Mr. Smith had no application toa ease of this kind, but was confined to the sale of estates, in regard to which a peculiar custom prevailed. Every one who had read Suugden on Vendors and Purchaers, a work .that -was read by non-professional as well as by professional readers, was aware that, where a vendor failed to complete his tItle the aintiff could only recover the expenses to which hh had been put; but whenthere was any other ground for thb breach of contract-for instance, if the vendor changed hib mind-the purchaser could recover damages. In that case a more gene-al rule of law prevailed, and It was necessary to see what the contract was, and what were the natural cony sequences Ilowing from the breach of it. By recovering the sum of 2501. for the deck and 2501. for the loss on the resale the plaintiff would be placed in the same positios as if the contract had been a valid one. His Lordship thought the proper measure of damages had been adopted. Mr. Justice ERLn Was of the same opinion, Rule discharged. * BBAIL COURT. (SiWngs at AV4 2'rius before Mfr.

The defendant, a butter-fac, tor, residing in Somersetshire, was a creditor for 1L1. On the 5th of February he called at the shop. She was there, and after some conversation he promised;t accept 31. in full discharge; she laid the money on the counter, and he wrote a receipt. On looking at it she saw it was only on account. She remonstrated, and begged of him to gie arcit in full or return the money. He struck hr knocked and kicked her on the leg, and ran out of the house. She screamed out.

Itthe pared that the defendant was the solicitor to the parish authorities.of Epsom in 1853, and, that legal proceedings having been threatenedl by Mr. D)orling and by a gas compan aansta certain poor-rate which had been made on a valuation of the parish by a surveyor named Penfold, the defendant direcaed nim to procure a fresh valuation by some eminent surveyor which might he used as a corroboration of his own, if such a course should become necessary and practicable. Mr. Penfold accrdingly employed Hz. Lee, who surveyed and valued the parish in 1853, and for his charges in rxespeot of that work the present action was brouight. Te question Involved in this rule was, whether on the evidence, which was chiefly documentary, the plaintiff had a right to look to the defendant, or was bound to look to the parish as his paymaster, he having originally inserted the parish as his employers in his book.

Upon this the prisoner was summoned before the magistrate underthe Pa brokers' Act, and his attorney then handed up a duplicate purporting to be the one which had been originally given to =lizabeth opwood, but which was found to be a orgery. The prisoner was then indicted for uttering a forged instrument, which, among other things, was called an accountable receipt forgoods, he knowing it to have beenforged.

Cloak; is the proprietor of some oyster-rooms in the Strand,and certain parts of bis premises; including a parlour (used only occasionally by his customers), had been entered in the beer license, in order that beer might be served therein. The Excise-offlcers entered the house and found some orange wine and a bottle of Oin in one of the parlour cupboards. The defendant explained that tne wine had been used on the occasion of a juvenile party given by his children, and the bottle of gin was kept there strictly for private use-by members of tho family and the servants exclusively. Mr. Dwelly, on behalf of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, contended that the Act of Parliament prohibited the use of wine or spirits even for private consumption in any room " entered" for the sale of eer only. The clauses expressly stated that neither wine nor spirits must be there. If the Act only meant " for, tie purposes of sale," it would have stated so. The magistrate appeared unwilling to adopt this view of the matter, but promised to look into the Act, and accordingly the cse was r (taddressing the Excise solicitor) said,-I have consulted the Act, MIr. Dwelly, and I am clearly of opinion that the strict interpretation of the clause for which you contend would notbe justiiiable. Doubtlees, the object of the Legislature was to prevent the keeper of a beer-shop from havig wine or spirits in his possession for the purpose of sale; but it was never intended to prevent his having them for his own private use, or theuse of his family, even if his private parlour happened to be one of the " entered" or licensed rooms. It is true that the words "for the purpose of sale" are not added to the claueo; but this omission is to be aceounted for, I think, by the evident intention of the Iegislature to throw the onus of proof upon the de. fendant. It was enough for the Excise to prove the finding of the prohibited articles in the "entered rooms," and it was left for the defendant to show with what object they were there. In this case I think the complaint is answered, and therefore I dismiss the summons; but I must caution the defendant that he has no right to send out for wine or spirits, even if the customers pay in advance, althounh this practice is believed to prevaiL. Ir is altogether illegal M tsnowE.-Janes Wiiams and John Green were brought up on remand before Mr. LONG, charged with having committed various robberies at shops into which they had gone and made purchases of articles to a small amount on Saturday, the 20th inst., and that thay had in a most artful manner succeeded in robbing persens of cash in the public streets and also in the places of business which they went into to buy articles. The prisoners, who are wel known to the po'ice, were taken into custody, and on their being searched by 377 S money was found upon them, as also a silver pre-entationsnuffbox, which turned out to belong to Mr. James Pearson, nurseryman, Haverstock-hill, Hampstead, in whose shop the prisoners had been on the Saturday in question. By the advice of Mr. Herring, jun., who attended for the prisoners, no defence was made, as the magistrate had madie up his mind for A committaL In two cases out of four which had been gone into, Mr. LONcG convicted and sentenced the prisoners to hard labour in the House of Correction for nine moaths, being six months each in one case and three months in another. They were then locked up. John Manning and John Welham were charged with having been concerned, with another not in custody, in stealing 601. i gold, the property of fr. Henry Smith, Seymour-place, Bryanston-square. In orderto afford time for the police to capture the third man sutpposed to be implicated, the prisoners were remanded til Saturday next. MAIiBontouG33sTr.T.-Isidore Gask, Garson Albin3ki, and Peter Urbani were charged with combining to prevent journeymen tailors from worldag for Mr. Gautier, tailor, of Kegent-street. It appeared that the prisoners were all foreigners, working as taiiOrs for west-end houses, and that they formed part of a body of about 100 tailors, pincpaly foreiners, who atle now on strike for higher wages than some of the trade ae disposed to pay. The dispute, it was stated by a peon hi court, with Mr. Gautier was that he was offering 16g for dress coats, while full-priced masters were payin'g B22. Several cases were goneinto where the defendants had called Ttpon' ourneymen who worked for Mr. Oautier, and intiii. dated them by threatening to cut their heads open, flouriesh ing stickrs at them, and by other meas to induce the a it once to leave their work and putthcselvtesdol ntheziat of ~~~men on striwnke.iblls It was urged in mitigation of the oSfence that being foreignerk, they were not acqulainted witih the EnglbFs Ia in- 'reference to strikes, and intimidation of personi: dopunpl theme to join in them. *lr.

In the list Irom the Mon;itur of promotions in the Lekian of Hlo,nour of English officers, given in The Times Of T!sursday, the name of Lieutenant-Colonel John Thorntotb Grant, 19th Regiment, was mentioned. It should be 1. 3utenant-Colonel John Thornton Grant, C.B., 49th Regib ent. The freightship Admiral left Woolwich-pier on Saturday -at 2 p.m., having on board the 23d Company of Royal Engineers and a cargo of nava3 and military stores for China. The company, co nsisting of 'Captain Clerke in command, Lieutenant Malcolm, Lieutenant Pritchard, Lieutenant Lennox, 4 sergeants, 9 corporals, and 83 privates, arrived at the Arsenal station from Chatham, where they were met by the band of the Royal Artillery regiment and escorted to the pier, whence they immediately embarked; and in less than an hour the vessel was under way for Gravesend. Mark Sharp, a gunner of the (C troop of Royal Horse Artillery, who was admitted to the hospital about ten days ago auffering from the loss of hbs thumb and other injuries, eustained by the premature explosion of a field piece -during the rcanceuvres which took place on Wool*wich-comnmon on the ocoasion of the visit of Lord Blboomfield, is progressing favourably, although inca. pacitated for further service. A detachment courtmnartial, compesed of one captain and two lieutenants of the corps, last week assembled to investigate the accusation brought agaist Sergeant W. Binns, who directed t'he firing party at the gun. The charge was preferred against the acoused, as neglect of duty in giving the word "Ready" before No. 2 gunner was clear of the gun wheeL The case having been clearly prove d was nevertheless acknowledged to bh one of ordinary occurrence in cases of speedy firing. By sentence of the court-martial, which was confirmed by the commanding officer, the prisoner was ordered to be reduced from the grade and pay of sergeant to the station of gunner in the ranks. The gunboat Leven was on Saturday removed from the basin at Woolwich, and, having shinped her ammunition at the Arsenal, she proceeded under steam to Greenhithe to adjust compasses and to join the gunboat squadron under orders for China. When near ing her moorings to be swung she got foul of one of the buoys, and damaged one -of the blades of her propeUer. She was consequently brought back to Woolwich for repairs. The paddlewheel 'steamers Bann and Brune having been pronounced by the Master Shipwright at Woolwich unfit to undertake the 'voyage to China, the Baun is ordered to be despatched to Sheerness, and the Brune to be fitted as a tender forservice -on the coast of Africa. A corporal of the Royal Marines, named Samuel Long, recently appointed with a detachm ent to serve on board the gunboat Slaney, ordered to China, died on Saturday morning in the Marine Infirmary at Woolwich from the effects -of a wound eustained on board the reoeiving-ship Hebe, moored off Woolwich Dockyard, on Thursday. It appears that the deceased, while parading his beat as the sentinel on duty, was savagely assaulted by a seaman named George Bave, who bad that morning been liberated from confinement below, and that immediately on reaching the upper -deck he deliberately cut the ship's boat adrift, so as to cut off all eominunication with the shore, and, rushing furiously -on the sentry, possessed himself of his bayonet, and plunged it into his groin with fatal success, vowing at the samo time that he would be revenged on more than one on board, and, fourishing the reeking weapon above his head, strode the deck in search of a second victim. It being 9 o'clock at night the deck was fortunately clear. The ship's boatswvain, who happened to be on particularly friendly terms with him, hearing the cries of the wounded ma-ine, hastened on deck, accompanied by a numberof the ship's .company, but no one thought it prudent to approach him, The boatswain, however, at length succeeded by stratagem (on the plea of shakling hands) in pinioning his arms, and thus prevented further bloodshed. A sergeant and some constables of the dockyard police were promnptly on board, 'when the delinquent was securely ironed and guarded for the night, and In the m orning was handed over to the custody of the civil authorities. On Saturday morning, at can early hour, perceiving that the poor fellow was in a dying state, a umessenger was despatche d to Greenwich to summon the attendance of Mr. Traill, the police magistrate of the 'district, in order to take the dying man's deposition, but he had expired before the magistrate's arrival. The mur'derer boasts of his crime, and declares his sorrow at having failed to satiate his revenge on more than one. A newv description of breech-loa ding gun, manufactured by M. A. M. Montigny, of Antwerp, was on Saturday landed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. The weight of the piece is two tons, and it is intended as a sample for the approval of the authorities. Two wrought-iron guns -a nine and three-pounder-have likewise been delivered at the Arsenal from the Nile foun dry, Birmingham, also as samples, with a view of introducing some important im-provoments into the artiUlery service of the army. Her Majesty's gunboat Minx, Lieutenant-Commander Richard H. Roe, was on Saturday paid off at Woolwich, and ordered to undergo repairs of machinery, &c., forthwith. The Avon steam-tender arrived at Portsmouth yesterday -with supernumeraries from the eastward, and left again in the evening for the westward with others. The Bustler paddlewheel steamtug, tender to the Hi bernia, at Gibraltar, arrive d at Sheerness on Friday evening, last from the Mediterranean, and left Sheerness for Woolwich. In consequenco ef the strong winds and beavy sea Mr. Jackson, Assistaut-Master- Attendant of Her Majesty's dockyard at Sheerness, super intending the raising of the Coastguard ca'ter Curlew, has been unable to raise her forward by her own chain cables so as to sweep her with proper chains for weighing her when the w eather permits. The Falmouth, T. Carrick second master in command, arrived at Sheern ess on Saturday last from Devonport and Portsmouth. A line-of-battle ship, supposed to be either the Cresry o. Majestic, from the Mediterranean, was seen off Portsmouth between 2 and4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, working up Channel. The Devastation, si, steam sloop, CommanderMarshall, arrived at Spithead on Saturday morning from Plymouth with men paid off from the James 'Watt and Euryalus; -she landed them, and then pro ceeded for the eastward with others. The Sylph steamvessel arrived at Portsmouth on Satur. 'day evening from the Chaunel Islands wiih the remaindes -of the 72d Regiment for Shorneliffe and a detachment oi Royal Artillery. The First Lord of the A dmiralty (Sir Charles Wood), Si, Baldwin Walker (Surveyor of the Navy) ; LieutenantColonel Greene, Director of Ad miralty Works, &c., are expected to make a visit to the gunboat slips at Haslar this ,day. It is supposed that a larger gunboat fotilla is about to bo fitted out for China. The Princess Charlotte, sailing three-decker, 104, was commissioned on Saturday at Portsmouth by Captain George St. Vincent -King, C.B., Aide de-Camp to the queen, for service as a barrack-ship for the China station. The follow. ing other offioers have been appointed to her, and her equipument is going on as quickly as possible :-Commander J. W. Derville, Lieutenants J. G. C. Evered and E. G. Belson, Paymaster G. -iL Deighton, Assistant-Paymaster F. Pen-fold, Clerk J. L. Page, Assistant-Clerk E. H. White. The MelviLle, 74, hosphil-ship, Commander Trollope, is rapidly fitting out in the basin at Portsmouth for the same station. 'Te -nc sLstance and Adventure, iron screw troopships, Will be also ready to pr2ceed to China next week. They take out the S2d Regiment from Por-tsmouth. The lawich of the large steam screw corvette Raccoon, 22 guns, took place at Chath3am dock vard on S itorday afternoon in the presence of several the Vswad spectators. The Raccoon has been built in the short rpace of ten months, iaving been laid down in May last.. She is constructed from the designs of Sir Baldwein Walk;ar, K.G.B., Surveyor of the Navy, by Mr. F. J. fAire, the master-shipwright. and his assistanti, and differs from the o.'her vesesls of this class in being furnished with an extra spar, deck.

THB BOEANBGBS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TDIES. Sir,-A letter appeared in your columns on the 23d inst. from the IRev. W. W. Champneys, enclosing a letter from the matron of the Government emigr ant ship Boanerges, in which an appeal to public charity was suggested on behalf of the emigrants of that vessel, on the ground that they were in a distressed and destitute condition in the Government depOt at Plymouth. The Emigration Commissioners (to whom no representation of the kind had been previously made) having in consequence directed an immediate inquiry into the matron's statements, I now enclose, by the Commissioners' directions, a copy of the report on the subject received from the surgeon of the Boanerges, who has aready made four voyages in the Commissioners' service with great credii, and a letter fromthe matron herself From these letters it will be seen that the emigrants in question are not in a position to require an appeal on their behalf to public charity. I am to add that the necessary direotions have been given for the repair of such of the clothes and boxes of the emigrants as had been injured since they originally sailed from LiverpooL Another vessel-the Vocalist-is being fitted at Liverpool, and will be shortly sent round to Plymouth to take the emigrants on.

"Government DepOt, Plymouth, April 24 " Sir,-In answer to Your inquiries, I beg to inform you i that I have visited the depot twice, and frequently three times a- day, for the purpose of seeing the aick. "I have given daily written orders for what medical comforts I have considered necessary, in the shape of wine, beer, milk, eggs, arrowroot, &c. " Those orders have always been duly attended to, and two accounts kept of the same-one by myself, in a book now in my possession, and one by the Mtaster of the Depot. " If considered necessary, I will send a copy of my 'Medical Comfort Book' to the Commissioners. " The scale of rations which they receive in the depOt is both ample and good, and any alteration or addition which I have recommended, for any or all of them, has been immediately attended to. " The people were disposed to complain at first, without cause, as they wanted, instead of going to the depot, to be allowed Is. 6d. per day, as in Cork. " The complaints made by the matron in The Times newspaper are utterly without foundation, except as regards their stock of olothes; and I understand that steps are being taken by the Commissioners to remedy that evil. "Injustice to the matron I must state that, since I joined th ship, shehasdone all in her power to carry out her duties, and has aiso exerted hersel to assist me in the per. formance of mine.

"Upon examination I knew it will be found that many are unprepared for the voyage in respect to necessary clothing; and, in regard to the comforts I allude to, those only know the value of them who, during a time of sickness on board ship, are able to have them in addition to the Commissioners' allowance.

Blyth and Green, of London. We smply hartered the ship, but wish to state that the passengers, as far as we are aware, have lost nothing; that since the sbip's return each passenger has been allowed 10s. od. per week, so that every family of four adults is receiving two guineas per week, which vwe imagine is more than most of them ever received in their lives before; and when we add that another ship has been fitted with every expedition to go round to take them on to their destination, we think the pubHc will see that not only have the Emigration Commissioners, but that owners, charterers, and ail concerned have done all in their power to remedy an accident which none of them could control, and that the enigrants have not been left in a position to require the sympathy of the public-at any rate. not in a pecuniary sense.

IAADY FRANKLIN'S ARCTIC BXPBDITION. TO THE EDITOR OF TH-: TIME,3. Sir,-The rumour contained in one of your recent leading articles respecting the intention of Lady Franklin to send out another and a final expedition to clear up the great Arctic mystery has within the last day or two ripened into reality, Lady Franklin having effected the purchase of a steam yacht admirably adapted for the requisite Arctic service, and the eminent and experienced Arctic voyager and explorer Captain M'Clintock haviDg accepted the command of the expedition. These facts alone are abundantly sufficient to show that Lady Franklin is as earnest as sbe is energetic in her intentionl of oarrying out the great duty which has devolved on her. But shall she be allowed to do this national work unassisted? I trust not. Already many leading scientifiS mn, among whom are the presidents of the Royal and Geographical &scieties, have evinced by liberal contributions towards the vqupment of Lady Frauklin's expedition that they consider the burden of this, the last effort to ascertain the fate of our countrymen should not fall entirely on the devoted and high-spirited widow of Sir John Franklin. It canmot. be too widely spread that this final search 'will he limited to a very emall portion of the Arctic regions, where all evidence-asi it is now very s6rong-points to the conclusien that a thorough exploration of the tract in question will be rewarded by the discovery of the relies of, the Erebus an& Terror.

TEA-GROWING IN INDIA. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMIES. Sir,-The very sensible and eloquent letter of yone correspondent, "0 .3. S." on the subject ef Indian inprovements as channels for the surplus capital of thi-s country brings to my mind a letter I received from my brother on the subject a year ago. Mly brother's duties exteid over a district of some 1,200 miles, mostly on orAtthe foot of the Himalaya range; and, as he has been seven or eight years in India, and as far as the extreme northern frontier, and is, moreover, fond of scientific puisuits, his opinion may be of service. He says that the extent of country suitable to the growth of tea on the various branches of the Himalayan range is almost without bounds, that the nature of the soil is per fectly suited to the growth of tea, and that the quality produced is of the finest and most valuable description. What I wish, however, most particularly to call the attention of capitalists to is the fact that the Indian Govern. ment is making great efforts to promote the growth of tea in these districts, or, at aU events, is making the moss liberal offers to men of enterprise. The terms on which they offer the land, provide plants, and assist settlers in every way make success almost a certainty, and success during the first few years must lead to princely revenues eventually. I have full particulars of the conditions offered b the Government, but they would be out of place here. Mybrother wrote merely for the information of myself and friends, thinking the opening a first-rate one. I believe the Government have other reasons besides the developement of the country's resources for making such liberal offers,such as a wish to be independent of China and the non-payment of It is indeed no matter of surprise that your correspondent a0 R. .." should so heartily ask, How can Englishmen,with such wonderful openings ,for the employment of their sur. plus capital,and such splendid channels forthe developement of the resources of our princely Indian empire,-how can they, with these and many other such enterprises before them2 lock up their capital at a small rate of interest in a Russian project over which they can hardly have the slightes possible control, and whitch is never likely to showv any surplus dividend t Hoping you wFil constantly keep the matters fresh in the pubic mind, I am. ;3ir. voar obedient servant A.

THR P1ODUCTIOy Op cOO2To. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It is reported in noe ltmes of yesterdaythata meeting of merchants and manufacturers has been held at Manchester for the purpose of promoting the growth of cotton " all over the world," and that in order to arrive at this intent an assooiation is to be formed, " to encourage by all practicable means the growth of cotton, by diffusing information, supply of machinery, and every possibleremoval of legislative impediments." Unless the persons interested in this vital question ar3 disposed to resort to far more energetic means, it is very much to be feared that the field of utility of the Cottoa Supply Association will be limited to some of the British possessions in the East and West Indies, and that the cultl vation of cotton in countries much nearer home vwi not make any progress whatever. There can be no doubt that cheap and excellent cotton might be procured from the south of Spain and Portugal from Calabria and Sicily, from the Archipelago and Levant from Tunis and Morocco, and from the west coast of Africa especially the Portuguese settlements south of the equator but it is quite useless to expect that the present indolent and gnorant possessors of the soil in those countries will give themselves any trouble to produce it, notwithstanding the information to be diffesed, or any nutmber of cotton gins which the Manchester association may UberaUy distribute. Practical example, not advice, is needed. Let the association purchase some of the tracts of uncultivated land, selecting them where it is known that good cotton has grown or can grow, let it encourage emigration to these, and establish model cotton farms where there is a fair presumption that the climate and soil are favourable, and when the native landowners haie seen what can be done and how it is to be done we may entertain reasonable hopes of their becoming duly sensible of the advantages to be derived from suppl in us with an artide for wl;ich we have an almost =umxtMM dernand. I visited the Peninsula a twelvemonth ago in order to examiein what manner the culture of cotton could best b promoted there, and acquired the conviction that unless the science, energy, and capital of the Anglo-Saxon race ba in the first instance brought into action, to fet an example, there is very little chance of our seeing any cotton in ofr markets from those countries which, like Spain and Portugal, long years of o pression or anarchy have debilitated. am, Sir. Your obedient gAevant I. LwickenJarn, April 23.
BRLLB-IaLE PAIB. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It would have been well if your correspondent "Camdenensis " had made some inquiry before he charged the directors of the North London Railway with authorizing the above abominable nuisance. The field in question is certainly the property of the company, but every precan. tion the directors could devise had been taken to prevent the repetition of the scene of lest year. The tenant who then brought the company into such discredit was dispos. sessed immediately afterwards, and the land let to another tenant, a Mr. William Ray, of 13, Camden-cottages, who had been weU recommended, under stipulations expressly prohibiting the use of the field for any other purpose tnan a4 pasture land. On the appearance of preparations for the fair application was made to the police magistrate at Clerkenwell by the company and thetenant for assistance to eject the intruders, Mr. Ray assuring the magistrate that he had in no way permitted the holding of the fair The magistrate at once despatched a police force to clear the ground. On the field, however, a receipt was produced by the proprietors of the fair for 201. paid to Mr. Ray for the privilege of the occupation. The case was again brought before the magistrate, who remanded the hearing till Wednesday next, holding Mr. Ray to bail in the meantime, and the directors will do all in their power to punish the tenant for so flagrant a breach of contract. It will be evident to any impartial observer that the company cannot derive any possible benefit from the fair as an additional source of traffic, for the land is not safflciently accessible to either of the passenger stations for this purpose. The company's interests are happily best served by the absence of any such annoyanees from the neighbourhood;* and, were it otherwise, the directors would not degrade the undertaking by earning traffic at so great a sacrifice. The inhabitants of Camden-towu may therefore rest assured that measures will be taken for putting it beyond tbe possibility of any one to hold a fair in the company's field hereafter. Yours obedienUvy HARRY C6TMRR Secretary. 2Euston Station, April 25.
LIVSRPOOL, April 25.-The Royal MIail steamship Europa sailed hence to-day for Boston with 130 passengers, a large cargo, and the mails. CEmNSE E rGRATroN.-A colrespondent writes to correct a statement made by Mfr. Gladstone in his letter inserted in The nimes of Friday respecting the mortality on board the Duke of Portland. In that letter it is stated that "there were half as many again of emigrants on board as the vessel was calcalated to carry, and that the frxit of it was a mortality of 128 out of 382 Chinese emigrants." In roference to this statement our present correspondent says :-"The Parliamentary report includes the certificate of the Emigration officewhich says ' I certify that the ship can carry 3 adults.' Other portions of the report will inform your readers that there were but 332 embarked (not 382 as iMr. Gladstone writes), that is two short of the number for which the Emigration of;icer granted a certificate." REVx:ENs AND DsBT oF VicToRL.L-We eontinue reviews of the progress of the various branches of wealth and industry and other statistical returns of Victoria durinn the year 1856, which, it is hardly necessary to remind onr readers, was most prosperous. Great anrd rapid, indeed, as the former progress of the colony has been, it was surpassed last year; bat the most promnising feature is the settlement and consolidation wbich anpear to have taken place in every materi6l interest. The total amount of gold obtained during 1856 was 3.533,527 ounces, valued at 14,134,1081., against 2 964,073 ounces, valued at 11,8i6,2921., in 1855, and 2,192,699 ounces, valued at 8,770,7961., in 1854. The total revenue of the o-lony during the present year was 3346,6711., or about 101. per head, according to the estimated n:uber of the population-7an enormous ratio, and all the inore astonishing because raised without the slightestgpressure upon the people. Of this amonut about 1.600,0001. is raised by the Customs, 90,00)1. from the gold duty, &a., and 7.50,0001. from the sale of Crown lands. The entire debt of the colony is 1,962,3851.. all of which has been raised solely for the execution of public works, which, as necessary Ad permanent improvements tothe colony,are mostfairly made a chargeuupon futuro generations as well as the present. Thei net increase of the sevenue over 1855 is 317,4471., which & entirely derivet from the Cnutoms; from al the others tbere is a decline, more or less. The increase in the Customs, which is most equally distribnted over every article included io the tariff, is 432, 201. The quantity of Crown lands sold during tbe ,ear was 463,525 acres, realizing 738,4931. The in6,rease in th easanaity of land brought into cultivation has bee4u very great, and so much attention hai recently been pa.d to agriculture that the colony will soon be. if it is not alres4r, .entirelY self-911pporting, so far as the great staples of snbsi-t ene 1 Noncpmned,w47* .gjg CisC Niw 7falancd *?GclzC. ,
WITCRABAFT. TO THE EDITOIO OB THE TIMES. Sir,-Conulderable interest, and almost equal astonish. ment, eems to have been exdited bymy communication t> your paper of the 7th inst. on the belief in witchcraft. Your own spirited and amusing eomments have operated, for a eseon atleast, as a maMcss *si.flcsmu in this neighbo,r. ho6d; but I hear thit, among your cotempora4es who have copied and remarked upon the nalra!ive, some pronounce it the work of a pennyna-liner, or a joke, and askfor rnwes and locrlities to anthenticate It. Living con. sttLtly among our rurl population, I am astonished at tlis very astonishment of others. To myself it was a curious br.t not a surpridng realization in detail of superstitions which I knew to prevail in all directions. But, as my ob. jectwas to make an useful contribution towards popular en. lightenment, by pointing out one very dark corner in the common mind, Iam dwlling to be responsible by name for what I wrote. Other names it would perhaps be still noon. siderate to parade; although, by an oversight, the name of one parish has been printed. I now send you, however, for my own satisfaction, additional private proofs that you have not been trifled with. I take the opportunity to mention a few more facts, and to malke a practical suggestion or two to such of your readers as may be also writers or lectr.ers. This last is my chief object In renewing the subject. Tho stYlo of my report has been complimented as "graphic." As this implies in some degree a dressing-up of the fact, I wish to assure you that every word was written down as spoken; some equally curious things wereloet, but none were added. This may be a useful hint to more ambitions witers in search of the graphic. Not one parish, bat at least five, might have figured by name as contributors to these anecdotes ; but not even these five have a right to be made famous above others. A friend has told we that on his lately asking the boys of a school. class tho meaning of " a witch," every boy save one answered simultaneously, "There's one at -, Sir," " There's another at -," &c. Each boy knew of some poor creature upon whom this maza famea had settled, and who of course suffers something from it, though she escapes the stake. I was walking home from a wedding about the time in question, by the side of the wedding party, all of whom wevre believers in " them things." I asked the bride and her smart friend " how they would like their own characters to be tested in the river, with their present buoyant-look. ing petticoats?' They declined the trial. I then asked them, " What was I expect¢d to do with old Mm C. if she had floated?' Answer (with the gravest look) " Why then, Sir, of course she would have to be made away with." An old man living near me well remembers the swim ming of the witch, which my applicant of 17th November cited-as a precedent. He thus related it to me:- " I don'tknow, Sir, whether we've one on'em inthis arish now (though old Mrs, L-, who died last year, she bore a very moderate character, and when Mr. P-, the farmer, offended her once, he had a colt went very awkward afterwards). But old MIrs Pointer-when I wuz a boy-she wus a real witch ! Har they swum. A long ladder was put across the river, and old Mr. Loveday stoed on it, push. smg her under water; but 'twas no use-up she come every time. Then they pulled her out, and began to mob her. Then she called out to be weighed against the church book but the churchwarden swore wiith a great oath that she should not come near the Blible, and told her * to go home, for a -infernal old witch as she was.' And so she was, Sir. They used to see bar little things crawling about near the clock." " What little things ?" " Ear imps they called 'em." " I want to knowr what an imp is like ?" "I never see one, Sir; I was only a boy. But 1've heard they was like little meece (mice)." So here is a rural witch complete. At solitary old woman doubled up in her hovel; a farthing rushlight giving her features a B.embrantish chiaro-scuro; two or three little " meece," become so tame in the process of starving on her crumbs as to be quite "bhar little things ," and the whole establishment is pronounced a corner of the kingdom of Darkness. after writing this it occurred to me to look for some 'cecount of the last trial for witchcraft, and I found it in Lord Campbell's Lile of Hale, a. J. and there also is the mouse. So true are your remarks on the obstinate vitality of tradition. My friend Mrs F., whose facts and argUmnents you have already given to the world, hearing from me that her possessed neighbour was better, " thanks God for so much supposes that th'old lady ha.ve left her alone for the present'. but fears she will soon f~at her again, and give her another chevy." But nowv, what is to be done ? These superstitions may not, as you say, be very dangerous, but they are far from harmless. Wheresoover the carcase is there will the vultures be. They minister to roguerg-the " canning~' man'" or woman's is a thriving trade; they darken the mmnd for general hig,her purposes, and for the highest; they denote an unexercised intellect, and a mechani¢al religion, any; they fasten on the minds of children,nand thus perpetuate, "from generation to generation little schemes" and great delusions lamentably inconsistent with " Committees of Councit" and other educational display. "Educate," says Lord Boberk Cecil, quoting your own " frightful exposure of this abyss of ignorance." " Edascate," says hlr. EingsmiDt in his letter to you, full of sensible remarks (though with some conclusions from the experience of a pealitentiary at which all outsidc might not arrive); hut, happity, no real experience can go with L,ord Robert's discouraging opinion; and when he bids his audience go forth and instruct beings "invincibly wand insuperably stolid" he is likea merchantman giving anunalimited order for "silk purses," and directing it to be executed out of " sews' ears." But to my know ledge several of the most stolid of peasants, born and bred in this |"e-era'ecusnpats-ia," have learned to read and write well during a voyage to A ustralia-the first uninterrupted opportunity that their lives have afforded t'hem, aFd that a brief a one. Not to trespass on you-" Education" mst bepeculiarly understood, when the darkness to be cleared away is that of superstition. Beading and writing may co-exist therewith, eveninproficency. Therefore, although these things are to be done, other things are not to be left undone-other things tending to awaken the intellect and to exercise the reason. In the satamcounty, which may feel rsther ashamed o have had its darkness exposed (though it is no mere than overspreads the land), it is fair to point o to onedof the very best movements which have yet been made anywhere towards the intellectual imnprovement of the people-the associations for promoting adult evening classes. Your paper of the 17th gave an interesting report of that at Brooke. We may perhaps forctell the birth of a book or two, and there may be seen a lecture here and thore en the subjeet to which so much attention has been called. Let them be done with the greatest jadgment, or not at alL I have alhadysentvto me acatalogue of 600 "oecnltworks," from which one might displayrthe absurdities ofcenturies,whileprofemcng to present the poor with a "fuhaivs lefmO1one" or "astroeosembstL," but this would be rather administering the poison than the antidote. Let those who write or lecture keep in view the end to be aimed at, and the " afoul" soil they have to workupon; they wilthehen not merely dig about and manure the weed they would eradicate. Perhaps Horace's rule "erldiculum aeri fortis et melifo s," t c, is suggestive of a nseful tone, but a mieture is best, something like the anti witch prescription, on the homceopathic prin - ciple that like cures like. A little ammoniacal pungencya little finger-nail sharpness-a little horse-nail weight and soedity-and let the arguaments, like the horse-nails, be driven home. Le t the Bible be handled, if necessary, reverently and sparingly. We have to do with this dispensation and there times. By the aid of that new and pro- irsing piece of our Christian machinery, the book-hawker, we migit thus hope to effect much good. It might be aided oy, and it would reciprocally aid, those rational conversations With ouradultparisboners whicharconeoftheplesAngresults of the deaneries' associations. Nor, finally, can Mr. Kings. mill's position be disputed-that useful knowledge may be conveyed and baneful errors corrected from the pulpit; though, surely, the salt of the gospel should always season food so specially spiritual, and the preacher must be distinct from the philosop hical leotnrAr- I am, Sir, Yours very obediently, E.

COBY0CATIOH. V.vv.lr" A large inumber of the elegy of the diooo of 2xeter aeebled in IZeter Cabedral on Friday lat for the purpos of electing two proctors to represent them In the Lower House of Convocation. The Rev. ChSnoelor 3[artin presided. The Rev. Dr. Coleridge, vicar of Thorverton, and the Rev. B. EL Browne, vic&r of Kenwyn andea, were nnanlmously elected. In returning thanks for the honour conferred upon him Dr. Coleridge said thatX if it wras a thankworthy oMce in days gone by I -when Convocation Was a shdow, how much more did he esteem it now that the form had ummed a substance and the drs bones had begun to live; for, as Bishop Andrews had smud, " We don't speak to dry bones, but to a realitPanda reality such as be truly believed would bring forth much fruit and be productive of much benefit tothe church of whichthey weremembersm Itwouldbae&seriousevil,hehbe Reved, tointroduce intothe Hous of Convocationan obstrace tivemember,whichcould alone checkthatflow of good which was now goinig on; for he would appeal to the worshipful Chairmsanto bar rwitness to the escellent spiti which had been apparenLI in the meetings of Convocathon during the. last five yeas. He believed thaton one occasion only was any painful feeling excited in the House; but he would not then specify it. Considering the frequency of the meetings and their long sittings, extending from 11 in the morning to 6 or 7 in the evening, that was aying s great deal, and it certainly contradicted the general rumour which pre. vailed among the Dublic that the clergy could not meet in Convocation without quarrelling. Formerly, if the Address to the Crown was sent down by the Upperto the Lower House, woe betide any man who altered it. It was true they might put an " and" for an " if," or put an "or" for "either," but more than that it was at their peril to alter. That time, however, was gone by, never to return. The Address to the Crownwas now a bona fide production, and was the united thought and consideration of both Houses. Very oonsiderable alteration was made in the last, and it was to be hoped that the same ngour would distingish the members of Convocation in the coming meetng. WORCESTE, The electionof proctors forthis diocess tookplace onFriday at the Cathedral t Worcester, after morningservi,e. There was a large attendance of the clergy, it being known that an opposition would be made to the re-election of the old proctors. The Venerable Archdeacon Hone presided. After the usual forms had been observed some discussion took place m to the alteration which had been made by the Bishop of Worcester in having one election only at Woroester for the whole diocess, instead of elections in the two archdeaconries of Coventry and Worcoster. At its close the Rev. T. L Claughton proposed the re-election of the Rev. HI A. Woodgate, which was seconded by the Hon. and Rev. W. L. Lyttqlton. The Rev. G. D. Wheeler then proposed, and the Rev. H. J. Hastings seconded, the reelection of the Rev. H. Seymonr. The Rev. J. opooner then moved, and the Rev. G. S. Bull seconded, the election of Dr. ller. A poll took place, and the numbers were fr. Seymour, 83; Mr. Woodgate, 46; Dr. Mbiller, 42. The old proctors were consequently re*elected.|
TEsE BisHopRic OF NoBwic3I.-The Hon. and Rev. J. T. Pelbam, who will shortly be consecrated Bishop of Norwich, has a pointed the Rev. J. J. S. Perowne, Fellow of Corpus Chrsta College, Cambridge, one of his examining chaplains. This appointment has given much satisfaction to the evangelical party in the diocess. CONFESSION OF A WIPE MUEDEPER.-Through the politeness of our worthy shoriff, Mr. S. J. Springer, we last evening paid a visit to RP J. IL Ward, who gave us the following confession in relation to the murder of his wife. Ward seemed to be deeply affected, frequently interrupting his disclosure by exclamations of deep sorrow and regret for the crime he had committed, and giving us a full and complete disdcosure of the same. After taking down his confession we read the same to him, when he pronounced i' correct. We give it to our readers as we had it from his own lipM, in the presence of the sheriff and others: -" On Tuesday evening, February 3, Mrs. Ward and myself had some words, during which Mrs. Ward struck me on the head with a fluid lamp, aso on the right side of the nose, causing the same to bleed freely. I begged her not to strike me, took the lamp away from her, and went to bed. We arose between 6 and 7 o'clock on Wednesday morlning. I spoke to her about the 'blow she had giving 3ie, showing her where she had struck me on the evening previous, also the blood on the bolster and tick. She said she wished I had bled to death, and, picking up a stik of hickory wood, she attempted to strike me. l warded off the blow, which fell upon my right thumb, laming it severely. The stick fell froza her hand, and as she stooped to pick it up I seized a flatiron, and in the heat of passion struck her with it on the right side of the head,. upon na under the ear, driving the earring into the flesh. She fell to the floor, exclaiming, 'Oh lIWard tyoh havo kiled me !' I dropped the flatiron, and went to her ; she was lying on her side. I turned her over on her back, and placed a petticoat under her head, supposing she was only Etunned. I used all means in my power to restore her, but in half an hour she died, having only spoken once, ' Oh, miy Nellie,' meaning, as I suppose, her little girl. I wrapped her head in a petti. coat and drew the bdy under the bed, to conceal it in case anyone should come in. About half-past 8 o'clock William R. Nathan, amnulatto boy, came to the door with some milk. I wextinto the shop, took the milk from him and he left. I then went to Liba Allen's grocery, bought a pound of sugar, and told him I was going away. I then returned to the house, and aftera short time commenced cutting up the body. I tore the clothes open from the throat down. I then took a small pocket-knife and opened the body; took out the bowels first, and then put them in the stove, upou the wood ; they being filled with air would make a noise in exploding, so Itook my knife and pricked holes through them, to prevent the noise; then took out the liver and heart, and put them in the stove; found it very difficult to burn them; had to take the poker and frequently stir them before they could be destroyed; I found the lungs very much decayed. I then took out the blood remaininr in the cavity of the body by placing a copper kettle close to the same, and scooping it out with my hands. I then dippd portions of her clothing in the same, and burnt it together, feariDg, if I put the blood in the stove alone, that it might bo discovered. I then made an incision through the flesh, along down each side, broke off the ribs and took out the breast bone, and throwing it into a large boiler, unjointed the arms at the shoulders, doubled them up and placed them in the boiler; then severed the remaining portions of the body by placing a stick of wood under the back and breaking the backbone over the same cutting away the flesh and ligament with a knife; theo tried to sever the head from the body; it proving ineffectual, I put the whole upper portion of the body in the boiler; then took a large carving-knife and severed the lower portions of the body, unjointed the logs at the knee, and again at the hip-joint; cut the thighs -open, and took out the bones and burnt them up; they burnt very rapidly. On Thursday night I commenced burning the body, by placing the upper and back portions of the same, together wit the ead, inthe stove. On Friday morning, finding i. had notbeenconsumed, I built a large fire by placing wood around and under it, and in a ahort time it was wholly consimned, except some small portions of the larger bones of the skulL The remaining portions of the body were kept in the bofier and in tubs under the bed, covered up with a corded petticoat, aud were there at the time the first search was made on Saturday by constable Curtis. Hearing on Saturday evening that the citizens were not satisfied with the search made by Mr. Curtis, I proceeded on Sunday morning to destroy the remainder of the body, by burning the same in the stove, cutting the fleshy parts of the thighs in small strips, the more readily to dispose of them. On Monday morning I took up the ashes in a small keg, sifting out the larger pieces of bone with my hands, placing the same in my overcoat pockets, which I scattered ia various places ina | the fields at different times. Also took the major por- tion of the trunk nails, together with the hinges, and' scattered them in different places. I then burnt her trunk and every vestige of her clothing, disposing of small portions at a time, to prevent their creating too much smoke." On the 6th inst. R. J. IL Ward, the murderer, was brought in, dressed as usual in a fuUl suit of black, appearing much downcast, and as the Court commanded hin to stand up he arose, breathing heavily, his eyes fixed upon the floor, and only momeatarily seedng the face of the judge. With one hand he leaned heaviy on the chair, while the other hung trembling at his side. After the judge had pronounced sentence of death Ward knelt down and, leaning on the chair, buried his face in his hands, weeping and groaning. He was suffered to remain thus for a few moments, as the formsofadjourningthe Courttill afternoon weregonethrough with, when Sheriff Springer touched him on the shoulder and he arose, apparently much more composed, and was taken to the gaoL-Toledo Commcrcic, Apra 6.
