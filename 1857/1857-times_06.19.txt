Berkshire, praying that in any measure which their lordships might pass for the amendment of the lawv of divorce, they would insert a clause exempting the clergy from the obligation to perform tho marriage ceremony in the cse of persons who had by adultery broken the bond of marriage. Earl NELSON presented a petition to the same effec. from the archdeaconry of Norwich and the parish of KirkstalL MINISTERS' MONEY (IRELAND) BILL. The order of the day for the second reading of this BiU baving been read, Earl GRANVILLE rose and said,-Although I never was more convinced of the wisdom of any measure than I am of that of the Bill to which I am about to ask your lordships to give a second reading, yet on many grounds I feel my own unfitness to bring the case be.ore your lordships. I think; however, that it will be better for me, instead of making apologies for myself, to attempt to explain as clearly and as shortly as I can the grounds upon which Her Majesty's Government have decided to adopt this Bill as their own, and to recommend it to your lordships' attention. This tax of ministers' money was imposed in the reign of Charles I. for the purpose of supporting Protestant ministers in eight of the principal towns of Ireland-towns in which, for poli. tical reasons, it was thought desirable to establish Protestant communities-and it was therefore a tax upon Protestants to support the ministers of their religion. I cannot help thiuldng that this is one instance among many which show how utterly futile are legislative attempts to coerce the people in their religious belief, because we see such towns as Cork, Waterford, and Limerick flourishing notwithstanding this institution, while some of the greatest and most prosperous towns, such as Belfast, have sprung up without any assistance of this sort. I know there is one point made on this subject to the effect that the tax was originally imposed upon Protestants, and therefore it would be unfair to release from it persons who bought property zubject to its operation, but who avail themselves of religious scruples to evade its payment. This fact is not sufficiently proved; because, although undoubtedly according to law no property oould be held in these towns except by Protestants, yet I believe that, as in the case of most similarly arbitrary enactments, this law was not enforced; and much property was, held by Catholics. Twenty-eight years afterwards the Act of James IL was passed to repeal this tax-not that I should quote this Act as an inducement to your lordships to follow in the footsteps of that ill-advised King; but considering how soon after the imposition of this tax the Act for its abolition was passed, and considering that that King was not very likely to have the interest of the Protestants very much at heart, it is some evidence that even at thab early period the tax was felt as a grievance by the Roman Catholics. This tax continued for many years, along with the question of tithe and church-rates, to excite in a most deplorable degree political and religious discord in Ireland. In the year 1853 an Act was passed which was of the greatest benefit to Ireland, and certainly of the greatest benefit to the established church of Irelaud, for which great credit is due to the Government of Lord Grey, and more particularly to the noble earl opposite, who was then Chief Secretary for Ireland. One great point of that Act was the abolition of the church cess, which was an impo. sition of far more ancient origin than ministers' money. It produced a far larger sum-70,000. a-year, and it was far more equally distributed-being borne by the whole country-by Protestant Dissenters as well as by Roman Catholics. Every reason that can be alleged in favour of the abolition of one is infinitely stronger in favour of the abolition of the other. However, the noble lord will explain to your lordships, I have no doubt, in what sense these two questions are different, and he wil I hope, give some information to the House as to whether it really was the intention of the Government of Lord Grey to emit the question of rinisters' money from that Act. If such was the intention of the Government I will venture to ask the noble lord the meaning of this clause in that Act:- "And be it further enacted, that in all parishes and places where, by virtue of any law, statute, or custom, provison may heretofore bave been made, by vestry or other assessment, for the maintenance of any curate, lecturer, clerk, or other minister or assistant in the celebration of divine worship, or attendant or sexton, such provision by vestry or other assessment shall from and after the passin of this Act wholly cease and determine; and it shall and may be lawful for the said commissioners under this Act, by and out of the proceeds of the said annual tax, and the other funds as aforesaid by this Act vested in them, to provide for all such purposes in such manner and proportions as to them shall seem fitting." Not being a lawyer, I don't understand very clearly what is meant in this clause by the words " out of the proceeds of this tax," soeing that the tax had just been repealed; but, above all, I do not understand how it is that ministers' money could continue to exist afterthe passing of this clause. I have no doubt that excellent technical reasons may be given for it, and I have no doubt that the noble earl can clearly state the intentions of the Government. and how far the clause was meant to go; but at present I cannot see why it does not include ministers' money, for the objections to the principle of ministers' money are quite as strong as to any of the taxes which it actually did abolish. I hope therefore that the noble earl will be kInd enough to explain what the Government intended to be the meaning of that clause. I do not wish to weary your lordships by references to Hansard or by any quotations of that sort; but I find that that Bill was advocated by Lord Althorp on the broad basis of the general state of Ireland and the necessity of removing the grounds of religious and political discord. The noble earl himself most ably and most eloquently advocated it on the principle "that the advantages to the established church are far more than counter-balanced by the odium attending its enforcement." He quoted the recommendation of the committee :- "But, without discussing the abstract question of right, your committee are of opinion that there might exist in Ireland funds, under the direction of a beard of first fraits, if riqhtly managed, sufficient in themselves for the whole of this charge; and it concludes by recommending the substitution of the first frulits of a certain annual tax, from 5 to 15 per cent., on all benefices of a certain annual value, and proposes that the fund so raised should be applied to the removal of church cess." And he went on to'say, "upon that very principle this measure proposes to provide for the church ces"'1 Every single argument of that sort applies in an infinitely greater degree to the principle of ministers' money. Some little time after that-about 1-5 years ago-the question was brought before Parliament, but the proposition to xbolish it altogether was negatived. In 1848 a committeeof the House of Commons was appointed to examine into the whole question. That committee, as far as one can judge from the report and the minutes of its proceedings, appeared to be unanimously of opinion that the evils of the tax were great, although they differed as to the exact mode of removing them. After that the oppoiition to the tax went on gaining ground by the good sense of the House of Commons and by the ventilation which it obtained, and various propositions were made for its repeal which were met, not by a direct refusal, but by different objections, geinerally based on the principle of postponement until the funds from which the tax might be replaced had grown more ample. At last it got to such a point under the Government of the noble earl opposite that a promise was given that a Bill should be brought in to settle the question. I know very waU that a Government has no right to ask others to state in what way they would remedy an evil, but when the noble earl opposite, with his weight and influence in this House, takes upon himself to ask your lordships to reject altogether the proposition of Her Majesty's Glovernment, I think it will be desirable that he should state what the measure of his Government was, or, at all events, the general principle of it-whether it was exactly the same as the measure which was shortly afterwards passed into law, which has to a certain extent gailed, or whether it con. tained other provisions which would have met the difculties of the question. The neble earls Government was sue. caeded by the Government of the noble earl below me. Thisquestion was considered by them, anda Bill wam brought in on the sabject. The objects of this Bill were excellent, but I hope ic is not humiliating to say-having been; party to the passing of the next Bill-that, though some of its principal objects have been most efficiently recured, others have entirely failed. The principal objects of that Bill were, in the first pla, to secure a coatinuous instead of a precarious income for the clergy ; next, to relieve them of the unpopularity to which they were exposed by having to collect this tax by their own collectors; and, thirdly, to release from the tax altogether certain clsses of poor house. ho!ders. It is worth while to see, first of all how far this last object has been carried out. The proportion of houses in the different towns reheved by that Act is as follows Dablin, 3 7ths; Cork, 4-ibths; Clonmel, 8 9th; Drogheda, 10-llths; Kilkenny. 10-13ths; Kinsale, 6-7ths; Limerick, 13-14ths; and Waterford, o-9ths. In all, 74 per cent., or three-quarters of the whole number of householders, have been relieved. Bat although the miisters were muIeted of 25 par cent. of their incomes, yet it has given them the greatest satisfAction to have paid directly from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners that reduced income, vwhich is, in fact, much greater than they have ever succeeded in coUecting themselves. The great evil whioh the Act failed to meet was the difficulty of collecting the tax. It wasenactedthattheEclesesticalCommissionersshouldbere- paidby thecorporations of the towns subject to thetax,which should themselves collect it and pay it to the civil paymaster, who should hand it over to the funds of the Ecclesiastical Commission. This provision has entirely failed. Dabln has collected the tax under peculiar circumstanoes which I do not think it advisable to go into in your lordships' House, but the other seven corporatlons have absolutely refused to collect it. It was not an agreeable thisg for the Executive Government to have to call upon large public bodies i to make themselves the instruments of enforcing the payment of a tax from their fellow-citizens which individually they looked upon as unjust and unfair, and which they had in their own persons resisted; but the duty of the Government was to see the law carried out, and from this they did not abstain. They brought an axtion against the principal offender, Cork; they got a judgment to the amount of 3,00W., acoompaned, how ever, by a declaration from the Judges that the lawr was, in thesr opinion, inoperative, and that itE. machinery was- inadeqate. Some of'the~ most learned counsel in Ireland-among them gentlemen opposed to Her Mfajesty's Government-advied an appeel. Notice of an ap e4 was given, and according to sin formation which have received that appeal is not likely to be settled iu less thantwo years; so that theresult will be four years' arrears of the tax-two already due and the two that will elapse during the hearing of the case. (Hear, hear.) Now, I pUt it to the good sense of your lordships whether, in sueh circumstances as these, the Government had any other alternative than that which they have adopted. It is clear that is' this tax were collected for imperial purposes it would be infinitely more wise and more advantageous to Her Majesty's Treasury to charge the whole amount on the Consolidated Fund than to raise it inL the mannernow done, andtobe compelledtoresortto expensive legal proceedings for a very doubtful issue in the end. (hear, hear.) I ask whother there is any noble lord, being a friend of the church of Ireland, or of England itself, who is prepared to suggest a course that it would have been more desirable for Hfer M£ajesty's Govern. ment to have adopted. For myself, I must say I am at a loss to see the alternative that was in the hands of the Government I have now stated as Clearly as I can the course of proceedings by which Her Majesty's Governament were led to the conclusion that they oiLght toadopt this measpre. It is not for me to anticipate objeotions, but I am bound to bear in mind that the noble earl opposite (theEarl of Derby) has given notice of a motion that the BiUl should be read a second time this day six months. The noble earl will, with the great ability thatcharacteries him, discover every possible objection that can be brought in the slightest degree to influence your lordships against the Bill, andI have no doubt he will state those objections in that clear, minuLte manner, and with that partioular charm that will oblige your lordships, not oertanly to assent to his arguments, but to listen most carefully to every word be utters. (Hear, hear.) I reserve, of course, my right to reply afterwards to such objections as may be urged against the measure, unless, az is most probable, they are met by some of my noble friends beside me; but in the meantime there are one or two arguments employed to which I shall take the liberty briefly to refer. The first of these is based on the great principle that it is wrong to diminish the propcrty of the church in any way whatever. I do not believe tbat this argument will be raised to-night. It appears to me impossible to urge it after the course that was taken on the Church Temporalities Act. (Hear, hear.) Another argument was that raised the other evening by the noble earl opposite (Earl of Ellenborough) ansd by the noble earl below the gangway (Earl of Wicklow), that we are transferring this amount to a fund which is nut sufficient to meet it. The noble earl (Ellenborough) has n-i objection to the principle of that transference, but I am afraid that if he waits till it is undeniably clear that the commissioners have ample funds on hand to meet the transference he will never arrive at such a result. It is only necessary to look at the report of the commissioners themselves as to the mode in which they deal with the expenditure committed to their charge, and the commonsense view they take of their duties, to enable us to jddge of the means which they have at their disposal under the Act. The commissioners have a difficult part to play Some of them are the most eminent men in Ireland, hut some are cx offldo members resident in Dublin, and I ppeal to your lordships whether ez oficio members of a hoard like this can really give to d6tails of this sort any other than a general and saperficial superintendenoe. (Hear.) One of the commissionersisunfortanatelydead- anotherisabove S0 years of age, and a third was representei as unfit for work because of the immense labours that had been thrown upon him. The Government immediately on becoming aware of these circumstances, proceeded to take steps to make up the deficiency that existed; but they were informed that this interferenoe had beceme unnecessary, as the gentleman who was laid aside had recovered his health. The first thing the oommissioners appear to have done, under the Church Tempora;ities Act, was to issue a requisition to the incumbents of the different psrishes, asking each of them to state the requirements of their particular parishes under the Act. Your lordships all know how unsatisfactory any general inquiry of that sort must be. If any of your lordships were to write to his cook, his coachman, and his bailiff, requiring a particular account fromi each of all that was necessary to be done in his particular department, you are perfectly aware how uasatisfactory the inquiry would be. It musthave been stiit more in a case like the present, while the application of therelief afforded by the commissioners could not fail to be a most difficult question. I find that the commissioners erected 50 Protestant churches with sittings for 10.041 persons, in parishes containing a population of 261,673 souls, of whom only 14,3!3, of all ages, were in commanion with the established church. (Hear, bear.) I did not mean to say there was no reason for erecting a church in any one of those cases, for I admit it would be a melancholy thing to find 100, or 50, or 20 Protestants in any part of the kingdom unable to obtain the religious comforts and instruction that they might require; butlIsay that if you goon on this scale it is iUll possible tbat any fund can be found of magnitude enough to meet such engagements. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl (Ellenborough) said the other night that it was impoosible to come to a conclusion on this matter without information as to the state of the funds of the commissioners; and the noble earl near me (Wicklow) thought it necessary that returns should be laid on your lordships' table giving further information. Now, my lords, I am quite willing to admit that as the case stands the expenditare of the commissioners doss not leave a balance. And here I would refer again to a dedaration made by Lord Altborp, in which he says :- I The amount of church-rates or cess does not, I believp, come to more than between 60,0001. and 70,000W. a-year, and as far as I can calculate the means I have placed at the disposal of Parliament, they will amount to about 69,0001. a-year, and there is therefore some deficiency in the means to be provided in lieu of church-rates. I am satisfied, however, that the expenses to which that cess is applied might be diminished, and in that case the means in the hands of the House would be sufficient for the purnoses intended." Now, it is quite clear that, having saddIed the commission with the church-rate, you have diminished the power of building churches to the extent of 60,0001. or 70,0001. a- year, and it is also clear that if we take away 12,001. more from the fund for ministers' money you will to t'that extent still more diminish the fund for building churches. It is impossible to examine the return without perceiving that savings of various lkinds may be effected. I see with regard to clerks and sextons' salaries there is a sum of 23,0001. charged, and it seems possible that a consolidation of those offices may lead to considerable economy. (Hear, hear.) There are then sums paid for various services, and for the sacramental elements, in which savings may be effected. Supposing that reductions can. be made iu these expanses, I am sure every sincere and pious Christian will desire to see them made, in order that this apple of discord among the Irish people may be removed. (near.) I am not sure that there are not other points even including the constitntion of the board itself, in which reduction may not be effected; but bey ond that I find from the comrissioners' returns that there wiR be a future increase in their revenues to the extent of at least 12,205- within the next few years. The annual payment to be made by any successor of the present Archbishop of Ar-nagh (who I hope will long remain with us) is4,5001. ; taxes upon the see of Armagh 2,3431. ; taxes on dignities and benefices not avoided since the passing of the Temporalities Act 4,0001., and from the suspension of 14 benefices 3,360O.; making a total of 12,2051. Therefore, my lords, not denying that by passing this Bil you will for the moment to a certain extent diminish the income of the church in Ireland, still I do behleve that by propereconomy it will be possible to replace the amount subtracted by this Bill, and that in futmre years an increased reveaue will more than meet any deficiency which it may create. I have now stated some of the grounds wby I think the ob.jections wbich have been raised are invalid, and why Her Majesty's Government have felt bound to pusue the course they have. I may venture to put it to your lordships whether, considering the question with regard to the practical result of your lordships' vote, you will withhold your assent from this measure. It this House shall adopt the Bill you will at once remove the only sore which now exists in Ire. land, the only rankling ground of irritation against the church establishment in that country. At the same time, you will be adding a charge, not of 12,0001., because the commissioners only receive 5,0001., but of a lesser amount upon the Ecclesiastical Fond, which, however, may be more than met by a proper economy on the part of the board. If, on the other hand,your lordsbips should reject this Bill. you will be placing vourselves in collision with the other House of Parliament upon this point, which I cannot but think would be a course pregnant with evil, and injurious to the church itself in Ireland. {Rear, hear.) The great majority of your lordships, I believe, are desirous of maintaining that churcb, and I need not recite the reasons which appear to render the maintenance of that church desirable. Bnt there are those who oppose it, and one reason asesigned by them, of the validity of which I give no opinion, but which is obviously a formidable one, is that there is alarge endowment for the religion of the minority, while the religion of the majority in Ireland is entirely disendowed. Some years ago there was strong feeling displayed in Ireland, and the ohurch in that country was plaoed in circumstances of consdderable dager. I believe that feeling has entirely pased away nd I ask your lordships whether it will bgwi or statesmanlike that for the sake of a palry tax like this we should risk the revival of that Beln firritatlon throughout Ireland. (Rfear, bear.) Even under the present Act the co~mnizionere do not r- ceive the money, althiough ihe Governlment has not hesltiLted to put the w in action; bat the difficulties attending the enforcement of the law is this case are immense. Not only are the prooeedings expensive, but we are informed, upon the hig est authority, that the machiner of the Act is indperative; amd if this Bill be rejected the Government will incur in futare the odium of prosecating corporations (many of which have no property) for a tax whick the House of Commons, by a majority of 139, has declared to be an odious tax-one that ought to be entirely abolished.' Leaving comfort out of the question, I asic will it be decent to plaoe Her Majesty's Government in that position? No doubt, the noble earl opposite will suggest a useful and practical alternative for this Bill, although at present I am entirely ignorantc in what wy it can be done, hut was I never more sincere or mnore earnest 2han I am nowf in as:ing your lordships to accede to the second reading of thiS BUlL (Hear, hear.) The question having been puft, The Earl of DERBY rose and said,-My lords, Imud confess it is not without some reluctance that I now rise to offer my most unhesitating, uncompromising opposition to theBill whichisnow beforeus. I imready toadmitupon the low ground of expediency upon which alone the noble earl has relied there are not wavnting plausible argmuents, of which I must do the noble earl the justica to say he has made the most, in support of a measure which arises from purely temporarycaus. I admit that the amount in ques. tion At present is very inconsiderable. I admit that in the localities where that tax is levied it has been the cause of considerable irritation and difficulty. I admit also that if this Bill do not pass, and the Act of 1854 were to Le repealed, the clergy would experience great difficulty in levying this tax. Bat I am not without hope that I shall succeed in convincing your lordships that even upon the low ground of expediency upon which my noble :friend defends this Bill there are argameats which will afford a complete reply. But beyond that I shaU base my opposition upon higher grounds than that of expediency -I shall rely upon principle, to which this Bill is diametrically opposed. (EHear, hear.) If this Bill can be shown to be a violation of the most sacred rights of property-of property not only enjoyed for a long succession of years. but the right to which has been oonfirmed within the last three years by additional legislation, then I think it will be unworthy of this House to decide this matter upon such grounds as the noble earl has suggested, and whicb, I may be permitted to say, without disrespect to the noble earl, are unworthy of a Government which undertakes the responsibility of conducting the affairs of a great nastion. MWy noble friend has told us truly that this minis. ters' money is a tax which was imposed upon certain de. scriptions of property as long ago as the reign of Charles II. It was imposed upon certain towns in Ireland, and has continued from that time to. be levied upon certain houses in those towms. lt will, perhaps, be a proper moment for me to take an opportunity of replying to the callenge of the noble earl to draw the distinction, which he says must be drawnr to warrant opposition, between ministers' money and those eharges which were dealt with'by Earl Grey's Government in 1832 and 183. I have the recollection of that period clearly inumy mind, for in the responsible situation which I filled in that Government the arrangement of church affairs in Ireland cost me no little anxiety and uneasiness. Bat i am happy to believe that those measures, stringent as they were, and op -be as they were by the friends of the estabhsnhed church, by the adversaries of teh church, and also by some members of that Cabinet in 'which I held asEeat, are now acknowledged to have rescued that church from a poaition of great danger. (Hear, hear.) I will just venture to bring before your lordships the circumnces in which tbe established church in Irelnd found itself in 1832 and 1833. At that time there was a violent crusade against the existence of that church, and in every possible way it was aseaulted by a large and powerful political body, led and encouraged by the late Mr. O'ConnelL That opposition was directed against tithes, against vestry cess, against ministers' money; in short, gainst every form in which pecuniary provion was made for theProtestant church in Ireland. Itis unnecessary to remind sour lordehips of the very painfulcircumstances invhichthe clergyof thatcountrywere the n placd. It is su'dicient to say that tithes which were iot then commuted had to be collected in kind from the very lowest classes of the population - for in consequence of the extraordinarysubdivlsion of landi,which prevailed then to a greater extent than at present, the clergy wvere obliged to collect their tithes directly from the occupieos. Of course, that was a state of things which gave great facilities for prctical opposition, as well as great ground for comDplaint as to the poley of the existing system. The result was that nine-tenths of the clergy in Ireland were absolutelydeprived of their incomes, or, if not deprived of them,. they experienced the most iolent opposition in collecting their tithe, not only fromn their own parishioners, hut from large bodiess of men who came from other districts to eai those who refused to pay. The oposition which was then offered to the levy of tithes was much more formidable than that wrhich is now offered to the collection of ministerse money. Accrding tothe principle of the noble earl, because it wa extremely hazardous and expensive to ollcect the tithes, we ought to ha ve givea wag to those who resisted the opera'ion of the law, to have aholished the tithes altogether, and to have deprivedSthedcergy of their revenues. (Hear, hear.) The opposition which the Government o£ that day had to encounter v,as a thou3sandold greater than any little paltry opposition which the Government of th:e present day have to meet in mintaining the law and discharging wvhat I believe to be the duty of.the Executsive. (B ear, hear.) But whait was the course which we pursued at that time ? We determined to give every supportito the clergy. I do not mean to siay that the poliee were emplo,ed in the collectiion of taithes, but both the police and the miiit;>ry were actsively, diliigenutly, and con stantly employed in protectiing the persons of those who, in the dischargje of a lawful duty, exposed themselves to risk and danger. Way, further, when the tithes which were taken in kind were seized and brought into the ma rket no purcShaserwas found who would venature to comeforward and buy, in consequence of the unive-rsal excitement and dissatisfactioen which prevailed. What was done?. The Government became purcha3sers of the tithes, and they sepplied the military with forage from the hay and corn so forced into the market. They' were purchasers whom no intin idation could deter,and tueconsequence was that much greater faciltites were given for realizing the tithes. But, undoubtedly, this was a st;ate of things which it vwould have been unsae, dangerous, and impossible long to con.- tinue. What, then, wzas the course which the Goverumeut took.? They supportoed the claims of the clergy, anId refused to yield to thosse who wrere depriving them of the means of living. In 1832 they took upon themselves thae collection of the tithe upon a memorial. froun the clergy that they were unal-le to raise them. In that year a sum of oO,000l., aud in 1e33 a sum of 1,000.03001., were advanced to pay up the claimss of the clergy upon the tithes of those years, which were olltected by the Government themselves;* but in the meartime the salient points of attack-the real objections to the operation of the law-were met by the measures which wre adopted. Those messures consisted, first, in the compulsory commutation of the tithes for a fixed moneypayment; and, secondly, in chargin!g the lanadlord, i..- stead of the tenant, with the burden of thae tithes, prospective upon the falling in of each particolar lease, and prospective in the case of a tenuat-at-will upon the expiration of 12 or 18 months. It was also provided that those land'lords who chose voluntarily to anticipate the timce whaen the burdten would fall upon themn would receive a reduction of charge to the amount of 20 per cent. The practical operationi of those measures was this .-Foxeseeing that the burden must i.n the course of a very short time fall upon them, the consequence of which would be that the feelings of the tenantry would cease to he excited, and the collection of the tithes would be easy, a certain proportion of the landowners came forward and volun. taril7 took the burden upon themselves, and, after considerable discussion, an arrangement was finally adopted by which the prospective change was made imme|diate, the whole burden being at once thrownl upon the landlords, who received a reduction of 25 per cent. Such was *he course which the Government pursued with respect to the tithes. They supported the claim, they maintained the princip le, they defended the property, but they removed those portions of the law which rendered it open to serious ol.jectxon, and liable to be easily opposed and successfully resisted. (Cheers.) I beg pardon of your lor'lshipe for occupying so much of your tiue in pointing out the difference in principle, unperceived by tue nohie earl, between the course pursued by the Government of Earl Grey in dealing with the tithes and that suggested by the Bill before us. Earl GIIANVILLE.-What 1 said was, that I could see no difference in principle between the present Bill and the measure proposed by the Government of Earl Grey relative to church-cess. The Earl of DERBY.-I can assue the noble earl that I shall not lose sight of that question. Well, my lords, the next subject that had to be dealt with was the church cess. It amounted in all to about 60,0001. a-year, and its character may be briefly described. It was to be leviable by the vestries of the differeut parishes according to their discretion; but there was his peculiaritv connected with it, that if, as in England, aln tlhe parishionera in Ireland had been entitled to vote in vestry on the qestion of churchcevs not a single farthing would have been received from one end of the country to the other. What. therefore, was the course pursued? Why, the Roman Catholics, the buLk Of whom paid the church cess in every parish, the moment the ordinary parish business was transacted were compelled to leave the place where the vestry was sitting, and then the fewv Protestant parishioners who remained fixed the amount of the tan; for the support of the church. That was a state of things which necessarily produced great irritation, great dissatisfaction, great unwilbingneas on the part of the Roman Catholic popuh. tion to pay the cess, and great unwillingness, let me add, on the part of the Protestants to impose such a burden upon those who had no voice in the matter. (Hexr.) But is Ireland there was another irregularity which could not be found in England. The law of twentieths, which was equivalent in principle to -tenths in England, had been abolised by an Act of Queen Aunn, yet the first-fruits of all benefices in Ireland, n lieu of being paid over, as in this country, to a board of first-fruits, 'ere used for defraing those charges which fell uponI the t cess, wrhich was, in point of fact, subsidiary to the amount of the first-fruits. I should say, also, that whie, on theone hand, the clergyof that time were deprived of most of the proceeds of their beneficen, the churches, on the othest were universally falling into decay-* the amount of re,pairs was utterly insufficient; and about half the benefines mn rrebnad were without globe-houses. A third of the paishesinIreland-about 450-were below 2001., and there was an urgent demand in the first place for the repair of churches; mn the next, for the enlargement of existing and the building of new churches; in thse third, for the erection of glebe-houm foithe cergy; and, in thaf, forthe miserably defient income to a certin dcnt rovidos for a clergyman and his family. The eourse whictke Government took was uterly to abolih the veftry ce*, amounting to 60,0001., and to relieve the clergy altogether, from the payment of fnt4ruit4s which eWer6 liablet3o the gment of the sams chate; but in 'ieu of f urst and vestry cees.A prospective char" 'wag lid Upon all beneficeg D fros to 3 Eer cent., gradually cordig th YZe vue of th I mg, but not touch ng co below 200 a-yJr. It Wi also provided that, as we have aen done with ertah uo ries - England, cerin bisbopric. in Ireland holWd be. superseded, the number being too large, and that the -f&Uarising from thoe sees should be devoted to the idrpoY E I hale already mentioned-a m ure in no way inoons tut with the interests of the church.

A wise man would cal ba afooL andan honest man. would callme a rogae, and the law would say that, being liable, I must put my conscientious scraples in my poclket and take my money out of my pocket, and pay the amount; (Loud cheers.) This charge does not fall exclusively ol. Protesants or on Roman Catholics, but on the occupiers of certain houses, the owners of which have bought those honses subnect to the tax, and therefore liable to pay it. I think I have sufficiently answered my noble frienil as to the distinction between church cess, uncertain in amount and voluntary in assessment, and ministers' mone. a fixed charge on property which the purchasers contract to pay at the time of the Surche. Hear, hear.) Iknow myargument ll be ligh y esteemed by my noble friend4 and I will therefore quote authority not of a very remote date as to the religious objections to the payment of zhis tax, In 1854 it w.s said,- " This tax had nothing to do with any religious question. Itwasa tax uponproperty, and it would be perfectly preposterous to make the rate upon a house dependent upon, the religion of its owner. The tax ws one upon property; to which every man knew he was liable when he pur. chased it, and hld really nothing whaever to do with religious feelng. (Rear hear.) That was the opinion in 1854 of a coDeaguei of my noble friend-a collegue then and a colleague nowthe present rst lordof the Treasury. (Cheers.) Xevertheless, Iam not prepared to denythatup tol15ther were very plausible ob)ections at all events to be raised to the incidence of this tx. The Houses which were liable were so liable according to the original valuation of the thne of Charles IL There had been great change in the value, and some houses which were valuable at that timne had become quite valueless since. Furthernrore, a large p,.o portion was levied on proprietors of very smal houses. Anc here I think my noble friend hardly did the clergy jastice when he said that, owing to the difficulty of collection, they abstained from colecting it; he might have given the clergy credit for some good feelimg in refraining from collecting the tax from tneir poorer parishioners, and not put it mnerely on the ground of the difficulty and exp,enEe. (E{ear, bear.) There were three objections urged against the tax, The first was the religious objection. The reLigious objection, although pat forward in the committee of 1848, wa, as I have shown, repudiated by the Government in 1854. The second was the inequality of the rate, owing to the change in the value of property. The third was the large proportion of the tax which, numerically speaking, fell upon zhe poorest class of houses. I am not now going to defend the Act of 1854, bnt I am aDout to draw the attention of your lordships to what the Act of 1854 did towards the removal of those most serious and valid objections. The Act of 1854, in the first place, relieved from the payment of ministers' money all houses under the annual value of 10l., analogous to the power of magistrates to relieve occupiers of very snmall houses from te payment of poor-rates. The second axnendment of thelawmade by the Act of 1854 was pro'siding that a new valuation should ta-e place, and that the percentage chargeable should be levied afterwards, acoording to the assessment of the poor-rate, and not according to the old valuation in the time of Charles 1L What was the result of the alteration of the law? Whereas there were liable to the tax before 1854, 51,019 houses, there were exempted by operation of the Act, 30,873 ; and there remnai liable 20,146; and of those 20,146 houses (I beg your lord. ships to bear this in mind, as I shal have to advert to it hereafter) 15,517, or just three-fourths of the whole, are in the city of Dablin. In Cork, Waterforc, LiHerick, Drogheda, Clonmel, Kilkenny, and Kinsale there are only 4,629 houses liable to the payment of this tax. The LoUinal amount of the tax before the Act wals something more than 15,000l. a-year, and by a provision in the Act, in consideration of the greater security in the receipt, the clergy were to receive 75 per cent. of the nominal income. The amon-t was to be paid by the Ecclesiastical Commissicners, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were to be paid by the corporations of the different towns, upon whom whether wisely or not, the Act of 1854 threw the liabilityof collecting the tax. But while the Act of 1854 removed the objectionable features of the tzx it maintained the principle that the property was still to be liable, and that the clergy should still be entitled to receive the income out of that property. I find Sir John Young speaking at that time in the following terms. He was asked why for so long a priod, from 1853 to 1854, no remedy had been applied to that which was confessedly a grievance in the collec-ionDof ministera' money, and he said,- "The reason why no remedy had been applied was t'h- that, though the amount was so small, the principle of the inviolability of property was concerned, for it was imp.ssible to talke it away without violating property and spreading considerable alarm among persons attached to the churcha If this property were taken away it would be asled what would remain inviolable." (Cheers.) In conformity with the principle adopted by all ptecediDg Governments, the noble earl who was at the ead of the Government in 1854 not only refused to do away with the liability of occapiers of property to pay charges to which they werejustly liable, but he went a s-ep beyondhispredecessors, and confirmed by Parliamentar4 sanction the right of the clergy on the one hand, and the liability of the taxpayers on the other. (Cheers) That was so recent as 1854, and yet in 1857 the members of the same Government which in 1854 made the arrangements for greater secarity come down upon grounds of expediency, and expediency alone, and expediency of the lovest description-namely, a tame and passive submission to the successful opposition of those whose duty it was to levy the tax, and ask your lordships to talke away that pro. perry which in 1854 they themselves declared to be in. violable. (Cheers.) I say, therefore, that for my own par I should be quite prepared to rest this case upon the ground of principle-.upon the same ground which induced seccessive Governments to abstain from so manifestly convenient a course as is now proposed. But I am prepared to meet it also on the ground of epdency, however plausible the expediency of abandoning this charge may at first sight appeaIr. lam prepared to deny the sufficiencyof the fund on which it is pooed t trow this additional charge. It is said to ce ~~let to ater thelaw, b tmynbefidhano be =xpe ient to alter thle law, b-u-t- -my noble friendas uo7t stated the grounds on which he thinks it expedient to do so. I wll take the question as to the suEfiiency of the fuand in whlich mynoble rend pro poses tothrowthisadditional charge tf 12,000. l beg, however, in passing, notto be supposedto admit that, even if the fund were sufficient to meet the Proposed charge, the principle on which the Bill is fonndea is such as to be deservting of vour lordshipse sanction. I aix prepared to show that the fund is not now and never can be adequate to meet all the legitimate purposes to -hich it is applicable. I have stated to your lordships, and I may here be permitted to repeat, that the charges, as estimated by Earl Grey, were 60,0004. a-lear for church-cess, 46,5 a-year for the augmentation of small livings, 20,000. a-year for the building and repair of cburches, and 10,0001. a-year for the building and repair of glebe houses; making in the whole 136,5001. To ueet this chawge Earl Grey supposed there would be 150,000 a- year in the hands of the commissioners, but instead of that the frund now at the disposl of the commissione-s amounts to no more than between 99,0Q01. and 100,0001., exclusive of any sum they may receive for ministers' money. If, there. fore, as I have stated, the income at the disposal oif the commissioners is under 100,0004 a-year, let me refer to the charges which are actually imposed, exclusive of ministers money. The actual revenue, exclusive of ministers' money amounts to 99,3764, and the charges imposed by the ack upon that fond amount to 79,5261, leaving, therefore, a, surplas of 19,8504 Let me remind your lordships of the pprposes to whicb, according to Earl Grey, the surplus was to be devoted, For bui.ding new chturches and chapels, forwhich the estimate was taken by S rul Grey at 20.00. a year, the sumputdownforthepre tyearis 9,4642. Iet me explain under what circumstancesiis proposedto ex. pend that sum, The Act provides tha in every case where new churches are to be built, one-fifth of the cost shi-l be derived from tne inhabitants in the lcality; but owingto the inadequacy of the fund at the disposal of the co.-Riuda ito ers,th have been compelled to require, not one-fifth, 'out one-hf, from the inhabitantsof thelocality. (Hear.) The commissioners propose to apply 9,464L a-year to the erection of new churches, and 3,63't. a-year to the enlargement of existi-g ones, making a total charge for new churches and the enlargement of existing ohurches of upwards of 13,0001. out of the surplus ac their disposal, estimated, as I have sbown, at something less than 20,CODl. a-year. (Hear, hear.) But the C3mmissioners say,- " The expenditure on 'new churches and enlargements' n urt del end in each year on the funds available for such purposes, afrer provision shall have been ma"o for necessary repairs. Tne sums now charged for those objects aro tho amounts expended on sn averageo of tho last three years to August, 1l 56; but these sums fall far short of what would be requirtd were the beard enabled to provide for uiany urgent casts which have been repeatedly brought under their notice. And it is to bo f u ther observed that, from tho apprehensioa that the 'ource of revenue arisintg fomu ministers' money will be Ait drawn, and wlhich amounts to a sum nearly equal to pho lroposed expenditare under eb*:,. heaids, tbe comuniss oern bave, at a late special meeting of their board, been en, at reluctantly obliged to suspend any further grants for such obUcctb (hear, hear), althouh iu two cases, greatly pressed on tleir atteation, assistauce from private subscrip tions to theaniount of nearly 2,0001. will be most probablh lost by d. lay.' So mach for the building and enlargement of churches.With regard to the augmentation of snail benelices under 1001. n-year, I anm not sure whether the tatal is 2,1301 or 2,0071. a-year, but taking it at its rnaimsusm the sum which they have been able to apply to that purpose is only a little upwards of 4,0001. a-year; and they have a surplus at this monment, after leavimg several objects to which the fund is available unprovided for, of 20,0001. a-year, mahing it necessary at the same time altogether to suspend their contributions for the building and enlargtment of churches to the amount of 12,0001. a-year. (31ear, hear.) And now, that being the state of the fund, I am gravely told that upon the ground of expcediency it is desirable to throw this additional charge upon it, and that in the opinion of the Governmoose the furd is w,ell able to bear it. (E1ear, hear.) But I appeal from the Government to the highest authority to which I cen refer- their own Lord Chancellor of lreland. I hold in my band the last report of the Eeelesiastieal Com. mis-ioners for Ireland, dated August, 1856, which is signed by the Archbishop of Armagh and the Archbishop of Dublin, and between the names of those most rev. prelates is the sigLature of " hlaziere Brady," Lord Chancellor of Ireland, attesting the accuracy of the statement contained in the report. Now, what does the report say ? In a case of this kind, whete the argument of the Government turns axltogether upon the suhliciency of the funds, your lordships will permnit ie to read the evideucegivenby the Lord Chancellor of Ireland:- " The difficulties (lie says) with which they (the Qoinmissiox,ers) have had to contend in this respect, and the dissatisfaction occasioned by their refusing to comply with imany reasonable demands, are likely to be much increased during the ensuing year, owing to a considerable defalcation in their funds from the non-receipt of a large portion of the moneys which, pursuant to the provisions of the Act of the 17th of Victoria, cap. 11, should have been levied by the collector-general of rates in the city of Dubihn, and the respective boards of guardians and other bodies, for the payment of ministers' money, the amount received by the commissioners from the Paymaster of Civil Services being but 4,9391. lOs. Id., while the paymeLts made by them to the clergy entitled to ministers' moiey have amounted this year to 12,3691. 17s. 9d., making the total sum paid on this account since the passing of the Act in 18'4. 21,3001. 7s. ; and we have to inform your exc llency tbat, having regard to the objects to which the funds vested in the board by the Church Temporalities Act had been dedicated prior to the Act which imposed on the board the payment of ministers' money, and also to the insufficiency of the funds at their disposal to provide adequately for those objects, the commissioners felt it necessary in the month of March last to call the attention of the Government, for the second time, to the large advances which had been made by them for payments on this account, and to the small proportion which had been lodged to their credit by the Paymnaster of Civll Services; but we regret to state that, notwithstanding the directions then given by your excellency for the recovery of these moneys, a very small amount has been since received. Under these circumstances we would take this opportunity of observing to your excellency that the cowmissioners cannot continue to make siuwilar advances without serious detriment to the numerous objects for which they have to provide." Cheer) There is the evidence of the Lord Chancellor of lreland, whose appointmuent was confirmed by the present Government; yet in the face of this evidence, showing that the funds of the commissioners are insuficient, and representing the impossibility of their continuing to make advanc s without serious detrimtent to the object to which those funds were primarily devoted, the Government state to your lordships that, in their judgment, the fands are amply sufficient, and that they may fairly be charged with an additional paynment of 12,0001. a-year, to increase the deficiency pointed out by the Lord Chancellor. (Hear, hear.) bSo much for thc question of expediency with regard to the sufficieacy of the fund to meet the demands upon it; bat I now come to the expediency of the pretences on which Her Majesty's Governmentrest the abandonment of sheprinciple upon which in I8'i4 they thought it right to insist. I will venture to say that whatever temporary advantage they may gain from the course they propose is in point of expediency infinitely counterbalanced by theinexped iency of teaching the people of Ireland that passive resistance to a legal charge is sure to secure the sanction and support of the Government, and; that if they resist or refuse to obey the law the law vill be altered. (Hear, hear.) I have alir-sdy stated that four-fifths of the houses liable to this tax are situate in the city of Dablin. The total sm raised is about 12,0001., of which S,4901. is chargeable upon Dublin, 2,21 01. upon Cork, and an amount of 1,4161. is divided among six other towns. It is, however, in conse nence of the resistance of Cork and the other six towns liatle to this impost, which pay about 3,0001. out of the 12,0001., that the Government propose to abolish the tax. 1 regard this Bill as a confession on the part of the Government of their inability to maintain the law. (Cheers.) I cannot conceive anything more damaging or injurious to the character of the present and of all Governments than the measure now under consideration. I venture to say that the Government have abundant means of enforcing the law. Why, with regard to nearly three-fourths of the tax there is no resistance on the part of the persons upon whom it is charged, but the opposition proceeds from certain corpirate bodies upon whom the duty of colleeting the rate is i-posed, and who were authorized by the Lord-Lieutenant of Jreland to suspend the collection of the tax. Was such a thing ever before knowa as a public body informing the Lord-Lieutenant that it was their deliberate intention not to obey the law (cheers), and requiring him, on that ground, to obtain an alteration of the law in accordance with t eir views? (Elear, hear.) If ever such a suggestion was made, can an instance be adduced when a Government did not reject the proposal with indignation, but, on the contrary, tamely yielded to the request, and themselves brought Iorvard a measure for carrying it into effect ? (Hear, hoar.) Don't tell me that the Government have no power to enforce the tax. The existing law provides that, in default of payment half-yearly, the amount shall be recoverable as a debt due to the Crown from the city of Dublin, or any other city or borough in which default may occur, and that the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland mnay order all sums due to the Crown to be recovered and paid to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Am Ito be told that, with the powers of recovering the tax as a Crown dbt, the law or the Government are so impotent in Ireland that 12,0001. cannot be collected in these eight cities ? In Dublin, however, which contributes three-fourths of the tax, no difficulty was made either by the payers or the collectors; and I will venture to say that if the Government had not themselves encouraged the suspension of the collection, by far the larger portion of the auto now due iu Dublin would have been paid without hesitation. The Act of 1854 enabled owners of property to conimute these annual payments upon very easy terms-14 years' purchase, but the commissioners state in their last report that only one proposal for commutation had been made in Dublin. I don't wonder at that; for if the Government sanction the non-payment of the tax, It is clear that nO man will purchase an exemption which be can obtain for nothing. The effect of the aboiition of the tax wi be to increase the value of the property liable to it in the city of Dublin to the amount of 8,0011. a-year. The owners of that property will he the persons chiefly benefited, and among them is a right hon. friend of mine, Mr. Sidney Herbert, who I believe is the last man who would desire to derive any personal advantage at the expense of the property of the church. There are many others alto, who, like my right hon. friend, would not, I am convinced, desire to derive advantage from a law which is founded not upon Justice but upon injustice. (lear, hear.) I oppoee this Bill upon the ground of principle, inasmuch as it takes away from the church property which belongs to that institution by a sacred right. I have proved to your lordships, upon tho evidence of the Ldrd Chancellor of Ireland, that the funds of the Ecolesiastical Commissioners, so far from being able at the present moment to bear an additional charge, are wholly inadequate to the charges imposed upon them by Parliament; and 1 bave presented to your lordships this considerationthat notbing can bo more dangerous than that a GovernIr,Ant soeuA y;IAs to4 osoeclmu foe rtocro ..aen shuldu yiold to tbo mer clamotur of one or two corporations, in a case vwhere there is no proved necessity for an alteration of the law, when the Government have already obtained judgment for the Crown in the Court of Ex- chequer, aad where, therefore, the law cannot be doubtfuL 'Upon all these grounds of principle and expediency I feel it my bounden duty to give my voice against this Bill, and to move that it be read a second time this day six months. Allow me, my lords, to add that the position of the individual clergymen will he precisely the same whether this Bill be passed or not. Tbey will receive their incomes, but they will receive them from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners at the expense of other great objects, wFhich were the nrimary objects of the Act of 1834, and which must be abaudoned if you consent to deprive commissioners of the funds which it is proposed to take from them by this Bill. (Cheers,) The noble earl concluded by moving that the Bill be read a second time that day six months. - The question having been put by the LORD CIACELLOR, The Earl of HARROWBY said that his noble friend opposite had shown much reluctance to grapple with the question as to what distinction there was between the case of church cess and that of ministers' money. The only dis. tincion that his noble friend could show was that in the case of church cess the rate was variable, while in that of ministers' money its amount was fixed and certain. How this small distinction was to support the whole weight of the argument which his noble friend had raised upon it he (Lord Harrowby) was unable to conceive. At any rate, this argument was favourable to the abolition of church-rates in England, because they were not a fixed charge upon property, and therefore, according to his noble friend, might properly be dealt with. (Hear, hear.) His noble friend had thrown the English clergy overboard. (Crie of " No, no," and "Hear, hear!") He was preparem entirely to abandon that argument in favour of the maintenance of church-rates which rested upon the faot that everybody <bad taken, inherited, bought property subject to Obem, because these rates 'were not fixed in theiramount. If there Was any value in the diatinction, he (Lord Earrowby) congratulated those who wished to abolish church-rates that they had in the person of his noble friend found the most iniportant ally who had yot joined them. (Hear, hoar.) In addition to this distinction between church ceas and ministers money, there was lanother, which operated in an entirely differont direction. The burden upon proparty to malntain tho churches was an aboriginal one, of which we could not find the date, and which had grown up with the groIth of the constitution and of all our social habits. M1inisters' money, however, was a burden, the date of vahich was known, and was not a very ancient one. In the reign of Charles II. the Parliament of Ireland thought it desirable to maintain the -inisters in certain towns by a particular charge on property; in 1857 the P'arliament of Great Britain and Irelantd thought it better to maintain them in a different manner. That was the amount of the difference, and he appealed to their lordships whether it was not much in favour of church cear as compared with ministers' money. Then, with regard to the principle of this imnpost. If that principle were so imporbant, so sacred, and so invariable, bow was it that his noble friend opposite consented without a murmur to the Act of 1854, by which, according to his own account, 30,000 ratepayers out of 50,000 were rahevttd from this charge. If this measure was a violation of principle, so also was the Act of 1'54, and in that violation his noble friend concurred. Lord DERBY.-I beg that my noble friend will not charge me with doing every act of the late Government which I did not oppose. The Earl of HARROWBY never said that his noble friend passed that measure. He only said that he did not oppose it, and that if it involved a violation of principle he neglected his duty in not resisting it. He did not understand how his noble friend could exempt himnself from responsibility. (Cries of " Oh, oh !") If he were an ordinary member of the House, who sauntered down on great occasions, he should be unwilling to saddle him withresponsibility, but being a leader in that House of a great party, whichtook particularinterestin all questions which concerned the church, more especially the church of Ireland, he was not entitled to discLaim connexion w ith any measure affecting the interests or the property of that church against which he had not remonstrated. He asserted that his noble friend did acquiesce in the Bill of 1854, and that by agreeing to that he acquiesced to the full extent in the prindple which the Government was now asking their lordships to carry a little further. Why did his noble friend acquiesce in that principle ? Because of the exceeding inconvenience of the then st ate of things. The Government now asked their lordships to carry the principle still further for a similar reaeon, because of the great inconvenience of the state of things which now existed. (Renewed cries of " Oh, oh !") It was easy to meet the argusents of a speaker by hooting -a practice which belonged rather to a more tumultuous assembly than to their lordships' House (hear, hear)-but he hoped that his would meet with some more intelligible response. The inconvenincne of the present state of things wvas not to be trifled with. No one knew better than his noble friend the danger of provoking political or religious hostility in Ireland, for he had himself on different occasions on which his reason was not convinced been obliged to yield in deference to the political inconvenience of carrying logio to its extreme results. The inconvenience of the present state of things was that you had to compel Roman Catholio corporations to levy an impost hated on religious grouands upon several of the most populous Roman Catholic towns of Ireland. If you employed all the machinery of the law for this purpose, you would run the risk of raising an agitation from which the most dangerous consequences might result. Would it be wise, then, to compel the Government to go on forcng the corporations to levy this impost, at the risk of exciting the religious animosity and discontent at the absence of which we had now so much reason to rejoice? Yet such would be the result of the rejection of this measure. He thought he had shown the necessity for a change, and the ona question was what I alteration should be adopted. If he could see any practical proposal other than that whilh had been made by the Government, he would willingly accept it. It was with great pain that he consented to impose an additional burden on a fund which was not adequate for all its original intentions (" hear, hear," from the Opposition) and to interpose between the fulU developement of all the beneficial objects which Parlament had contemplated. All the most impcortant objects, however, of that Act, as regarded the existing churches, had been obtained, antd, althoughb he should rejoice as much as any one to see the church of Ire land expand itself all over the face of the country, yet to ini. terfere with the means of its future expansion was a very different thing from diverting the provision for its present requirements. Had the Government of LordGrey,atthe time of the Church Temporalities Act, included the extinction of this tax among the purposes to which the funds of the commissioners should be able, no body would have complained. There was no fund of this sort in England, and yet the established church in this country was not found to suffer for want of it. The proposal of the Government was a perfectly fair one, and it might have been inserted by the noble earl opposite in the Act of 1833, with the utmost propriety. If their lordships should refuse to deal with the question now, they would leave open a dangerous sore, whioh might spread to any extent. Tho measure of the Government was supported by a large majority of the other House, and unless some other better mode of remedying the difficulty could be suggested he hoped their lordships would adopt it, and not run the risk which might aise from having to compel Roman Catholic corporations to make themselves the inlstrument of collecting a tax so odious to their fellow-citizens. The Bishop of KILMORE thought that this Bill was calculated to do the greatest injury to the Irish branch of the established church. (Hear, hear.) This, he believed, was the opinion of all the clergymen of the Irish church, with rare exceptions, if any exception at alL The Bill proposed, without any equivalent, to take a sum of 11,5451. from the revenues of the established church, and to hand it over to. those householders on whose property it had been a legal charge for more than 200 years. (Cheers.) The principle of the Bill was of the most dangerous character, for if it were sanctioned in this instance there was no reason why it should not at once be extended to tithe rent-charges, and, in fact, to all the property of the established church. Expediency was the only argument urged in favour of the Bill, and expediencywould equally justify the alienation of the remainder of the revenues of the church. This question of ministers' money had bean thoroughly sifted by a cormmittee of the other House in 1848, and three years ago there was an Act passed which was understood in Ireland to be a final compromise of the whole question, That Act removed every fair and legitimate objection which was taken by the committee to ministers' money, with the exception of one which the committee called " a paramount objection"-bhe. religious complexion of the tax. The inequalities of the valuations, the collection by the clergy, and the extent to which the tax pressed on the poorer classes, were all. remedied by the Act of 1853, but with the religious part of the question the Legislature did not meddle. Now, because the public bodies consisting for the most part of Roman Catholics, to whom the collection of this tax was handed' over by the Act of 1853 had refused to collect It, the Government, instead of making the obedience of the people conform to the law, proposed to make the law conform to the dis-edience of the people. This Bil went a great deal further than the " paramount objection" of the committee of the House of Commons; for, instead of merely reHeving those who had reLigous objections to the tax, it exempted persons also who had never expressed any wish to be exempted. Notwithstanding the doubt expresed by the noble earl below, he was still of opinion that this was a tax which had been imposed by a Protestant king on Protestant property for the support of a Protestant church. The measure proposed in this Bill was condemned by a committee, of which Mr. Sheil was chairman. It was proposed in that committee by Mr. Reynolds that a Bill should be introduced to abolish ministers' money and charge it on the fund of the commissioners. The committee were equally divided on the question, and Mr. Sheil, the chairman, gave his castimg vote against the motion. The committee, having rejected Mr. Reynolds's proposal, brought forward one of their own, and, oddly enough, they arrived at the conclusion that the revenue of the commissioners was adequate to their annual expenditure. That was a great mistake. L3st year the expenditure of the commissioners was 92,000h Mr. Quin put down the revenue, supposing all the money was collected, at 83,0001., but, in reality, the money collected was only 71,0001, to meet an expenditure of 92,0001. If the present Bill passed, no money would be left for building and enlarging churches. At this moment there were 63 applications for re-building parish churches. There had been subscribed privately 14,000h for that purpose, provided assistance could be got from the commissioners, and if this Bill passed none of those churches would ever be built. It was said Protestants should themselves subscribe for the rebuilding of their churches. Now, a sum of 68,0001. had been raised by the Protestants of Ireland for that purposes, and that sum had spassed through the hands of the commissioners. In addition to this he could state the case of two dioceses, in which 40,0001. had been raised that never came into the hands of the commissioners, but had been applied directly to church building byindividuals. (Hear,hear.) One great reason why there could not be a surplus in the hands of the commissioners wasthe increasing expenses consequent on the higher price of material for building and the higher wages paid for labour in Ireland. (IHear.) Notwithstanding all this the demands of the church were increasin g. The chmrch, was extending itself in every direction in Ireland, and h, could say from experience that wherever a church was bult it was immediately filled by an attentive and pious congregation, The noble earl(Eail Granville) spoke of 10,0 sittings having been provided for a small nimber of Protestant inbabitantsbut, surely if there were 50 Protestants in one parish and 50 in another, these were not to bp dbp4vecl of the opportunity of worshipping God according to he dictates of their conrscience; and there was no reason why the Protestant population should not increase in those plac. Protestnt congregations had started up in the most unexpected places in Ireland, even in the wilds of Connemara, where formaerly hardly a Protestant was to be found. To show how Protes- tant congregations increased, he would instance the case of Cavan. In that town there was formerly a miserable church capable of holding 200 people, and the attendance was very bad. In 1816 a new church was built to hold 500 or 600- three years ago it was enlarged so as to hold 1,000, and it was now crowded every Sunday. Whatever the cause, certain it was that what had been a forest was becoming a fruitful field; congregations were increasing every day, and although the commissoners might expect soon an increase in their funds of some 8,0001. a-year, yet that amount would be Insufficient to meet the growing necessities of the church. The Bill would therefore operte to cripple the means of the established church in ielard (hear, hear), to injure her usefulness, and to deprive Protestants of the only fund from which places of worship oould be built. He opposed the BQI because it contravened ;the ChurchTemporalitiesAct, some of the 3ostimnortantprovi- sionsof tbatActbeingvirtuallyrepoaledbytiemeasure ore the House. He opposed it also be use when in 1833 the church cas was abolished an equivalent was granted, bat which equivalent would be ditinished by thisBillono less an extent than one-tenth of its whole amount. (Eear, He opposed it because, instead of being a measure calcellateX o introduce peace and goodwill, it passing would be re- garded by one party as a triumph and by the other as a gievous wrong-feelings which were not likely to conduce to more friendly sentiments, (Hear.) Hie oppmosed the Bill, also, because wb~ile it pretenaded the f5 4 ould ba made up by the commissioners, yet, in fact, they would ba deived from tbe stipends of the most wretohedly. paid clergymern in Ireland-those whose benefices' were Under 1001. a-year, 'who would be forbidden by the Bill ix passed into law from ever expeoting any increase in their iucomes. (Hear.) There were now no les than 302 benotices in Ireland, the stipends attached to which were under 1001. per annum, and to mako them up. to that amount would require no less than 7,8001., while to bring them up to the standard contemplated by the Churoh Temporalities Act of 2001. per year would require no less than 48,0001. Ile therefore earnestly hoped the House woald hesitate long before it sanctioned a measure which woald condemn masy of the most pious and hardworldng of the clergy in Ireland to bop,eless and irremediable Poverty, and which could not fail to inflict a severe, if not irrecoverable blow upon the established church in that country. (Hlear, bear.) The Earl of CORIK, from his connexion with a city which bad been foremost in objecting to the tax of ministers' money, felt called upon to make a fewv observations upon the Bill before the House. He thought, even were the difficulties that would ensue from the abolition of the tax more considerable than had been alleged, or Was evens the injury likely to be inflicted upon the established church still greater than he ventured to believe would be the case, it would still be only right to make every attempt to repeal atax which stoodcinthe singularpositionof being odiousalike to the receivers and to the payers-deprecated by Protestants and denounced by Roman Catholics-which was a festering sore in the bosom of the established church. (Rear, hear ) The tax Itself was objectionable, but even in its imposition it was unjust and irregular, the burden of it not being borne by the respective towns which paid it in due proportion to their respective means. From a return laid before the House in 1855 he found that the amount raised in Limerick only exceeded by 3. the amount paid by Kilkenny, although the former city was twice as large and twice as wealthy as the latter. Oneof the pretended features of the Act of 1854 was the exemption from the tax of all houses of less rental than 101., but, in fact, those houses had been previously practically exempted from the tax. The attempt to makethe corporations of the various towns collectors of the tax had been utterly unsuccessful, as might have been expected. It was natural that in towns where Roman Catholics predominated greatly in number over Protestants the corporations elected by the inhabitants would be chiefly adherents of the former religion and equally natural was it that corporations thus constituted should decline to be the collectors of a tax which they regarded as odious and oppressive. The corporation of the city of Cork had so refused, and the Government had proceeded against them. The Irish Court had pronounced against the corporation, who, however, gave notice of appeal to that House, and the question still remainod pending-an irritating source of disagreement. Regarding the tax in its less obnoxious light of an impost upon property, he could state that It had been unfairly charged upon property which was not liable to it. He knew a case in which a parish of the suburbs of Cork, which had never possessed a church since the reign of Edward IV., was annexed to the adjoining parish in the city of Cork in 1824, and immediately rendered liable to the church cess. When that cess was abolished the rector, in 1838, pro^ured a valuation to be made of the parish awhich had beea added in 1824, and upon that valaation made a demand for ministers' money. At present a large portion of the houses which were chargeable with the tax were not situate within the boundaries of the city, and therefore, according totheterms of theAct of CharlesII., were not liable to the impost. Such were the principal objections to the tax. Some of them were comparatively insignifcant; but he begged their lordships to remember that a very wide principle was involved. (Loud cries of "HIear, hear," from thie Oppoc.ition benches.) HTe did not concar in the statement which had been made, that the sum in the hands of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners waS insuSficient to sustain this additional burden; but even if it were he thought that with judicious management a balance mnight be created large enough to do so, and certain he was that any money so applied by the commissioners would not be diverted from its original purpose. He believed that the proposed change, sO far from weakening, would strengthen the position of tbe established church. It would draw closer the bonds of union between the Protestants and Roman Catholics, and remove petty jealousies. He trusted. therefore, that their lordshiis would not, by rejecting the Bill, be the means of continuing a system which must always create a great amont of hitter. ness and ill-feeling in Ireland. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of DUNGANNON oppoeed the Bill, saying that a grosser act of injustice-a more flagrant act of spoliaticn on the plea of expediency-was never attempted m either House of Parliament. It would prevent the Eeclesisa. tical Commissioners from expending their funds in aid eif the objects which they were appointed to promote, andwhat was far more objectionable than all the rest-would deprive the clergy to a great extent of the remaining ad. vantages to which they could lay claim. When those who paid the tax acquired their property they lmew that it was liable to this charge, and theyr had no right to come forwaidi now and, on the plea of religions scrnple, refuse to pay that to which they were justly lable. He did net believe that their lotdships would esrtablish a better feeling between Protestants and Roman Catholics by inflicting an uncalled-for and unjustifiable injuryupon the former. The truth was that this Bill was part and parcel of that injustice wrhich for a long time had be en practised by the E3xecgtive towards the Protestant party inlreland, and more especiallytowards the established church. If such a measure were to be passed into law. a precedent would be established which would endanger the security of property of every description, The Earl of WICKLOW congratulated the President of the Council that this Bill, which appeared to him to be one of spoliation, did not originate with the Government, and expressed his belief that no one would be more surprised at its passsing than the hon. gentleman who introduced it, He was of opinion that two-thirds of the money was paid freely and willingly, and that the whole aum might be easily collected. The Earl of D)ONOUJGHMORbE thought that the arguments which had been used were in favour of the rejection of the mneasure, but that if it passed there would be no securit,y against a proposition to abolish the tithe rentchawrge, as beth impasts rested on the same principle. A d- verting to the arrangement of 1854, hie contended that it was a fair one upon the whole, and, answered every objec;tion, except that urged by the p,oman Catholics, that it was wirong that a Roman Catholic occupier should pay a tax in Isupport of the Protestant church. To that objection he rephed that is their lordships once recognised the validity of it they gave up the whole principle on which the revenues of the Protestant Church in Ireland were collected. The noble earl then proceeded to read extracts from the reports of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, from 1842 downwards, and contended that the whole tenour of those reports showed the want of the necessary funds for carrying out someof the principal objects for which the commission was established. |It aippeared, he added, that there were in Ireland 302 b enefices below the value of 1001. a-year, and which it Iwould require 7,8001. to raise to that amount. There were Ialso 629 beneflees below the value of 2001. a-year, and which could not be raised to that value without an expenditure of 48,0001. The taX nowv under discussion was applied to meat these cases; and he contended that their lordships would be guilty of a gross breach of trust if they applied the funds intended to raise the incomes of the poorer clergy to other objects. (H[ear, hear.) It wvas said,that this measure was brought forward with the view of putting an end to agitation in Ireland. He asked their lordships to compare the position of his noble friend (Lord Derby) in 1833, when he introduced the great measure of church reform, with the position of noble lords opposite on the present occasion. In 1833 a dangerous agitation existed in Ireland; and, although it was met by large, ample, and well-considered concessons, the revenues of the church were preserved, and the principle upon which the establishment was founded was msaitained. But what was the agitation with reference to this question ? It proceeded from seven towns, which contributed about 4,0001. out of 12,0001. to the tax, the remaining 8,0001. being raised in Dublin. The parsons who were liable to the tax did not refuse payment, but the persons whose duty it was to collect the rate refused to collect it. (HIear, hear.) The collection devolved upon the corporate authorities of the towns, who were, in many cases, in the south of Ireland, aunder the direct inltuence and control of the Roman Catholic priesthood (hear, hear), and acting under that influence they refused to collect the tax. These corporations had hxd the impertinence to tell the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to his face that they would not obey the law. What, he asked, should have been the answer given to such a declaration by any viceroy who really desired to maintain the law of the land?9 He should have told them that his duty was plain, and that the law should be obeyed. (Hear.) But the Lord Lieutenant yielded to thee applicants; he told them he admitted they were right;and because these little corporations objected to collect 4,0001. a-year P?arliament was asked to abandon 12,0001. a-year of church property. (Hear, hear.) Rle (Lord IDonoughmore) thought the proper course would have been ' to say, " We will first make you obey the law, and thenl we will ascertain whether you have any real grievance." It was |admitted by the Governmcent that in this case they were proceedmng upon the ground of a miserable expediency, and hwolthrefore support the amendment. Lord TALBOT DE RAAEIDE said that if he could bring himself to believe that the two noble earls opposite were correct in their opinions that the existing law was sufficiently stringent to secure the collection of ministers' money in Ireland he would feel considerable hesitation in voting for the Bill. He considered that the great difficulty with regard to this question had been occasioned by the Act generally known as Sir John Young's Act, which established a much more cumbrous machinery than that which previoTuly existed for the collection of the tax. He did not see the force of the distinction which had been drawn between the foundations on which church cess and ministers' money rested. No doubt, there was a difference ("' hear, hear," from the Opposition benches), but he thought that a prescriptive title was quite as good as any right derived from a statute. The evidence taken before the committee in 1848 showed that before the passing of the Act of 1864 the collection of this tax was impracticable, and that ny such arrangement as the tithe commutation was imposUble. Upon this point the noble lord read a letter, wntten by the late Dean of Limerick, who said that from obsevation and inquiry he had arrived at the conviction that there could be no transference of the liability to this tax from the tenant to the landlord, and that the only proper n wotld be to place the burden where it ought to eave been placed in 1834-on the funds of the Ecclesiastical Commission. (Hear.) Nothing could be stronger than this, nor was there in it anything inconsistent with the desir- which must be felt by any zealous clergyman for tho erection of fresh churches. For his own part, he deeDly regretted that there was not a large fund applicable to ths eremiiion and repaing of churches, but he did not think that the Ecdeslastical Commissioners were a proper body to administer such a fund. From their reports it appeared that they had made numerous grants for the building of churches towards which no local contributions had been raised; and, to his own knowledge, muck of the money which they had spent in rebtilding chuaches had been worse thAn w sted.

LONDOR, PBrDAY. JUTJH 19, 18. Their Lordships met at 5 o'clock. On theimotion for the second reading of theliEnis. ters Money (Ireland) Bill, Earl GxAvnna briefly explained the grounds which had led the Government to adopt and lay the Bil before the consideration of their Lordships' House, and pointed out the defective nature of the present arrangements, which, as regarded the collection of the money, were almost totally ineffective. It would, doubtless, be contended that under no circumstances should the Legielature interfere to diminish the property of the Churoc, but in the present instance the diminution was nominal rather than real, and the revenues at the dispo3al of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were suflicient to cover the small deficiency which might arise from the impost being done away with. Re trusted tbat the noble Earl opposite, if he felt called upon to oppose the second reading of the Bill, would at leaat have some practical remedy to suggest in the stead of an Act the machinery of which was totally inoperative and only a fertile source of odium and ill. will The Earl of D3any unhesitatingly opposed the measure. The only argument brought forwznd in favour of the abolition of Ministers' Ioney was that of expediency,which,if deemed asufficientexcasefor such innovations, would have justified the Government at least as well in abrogating the tithe system. It was absurd to call the impost a tax on religious opinions. It was a rate levied on property, and of the existence of which the purchaser was well aware befora he bought it. But even on the low ground of expediency he was prepared to contest the further progress of the Bill, and to show that the tund at the disposal of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners was inadequate to meet this additional burden of 12,0001. per annum, which would be thrown upon it if the measure became a law. The noble Earl then referred to documents and reports of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to prove how inefficient was the sum which remained! in their hands to meet to formidable a drain upon their reEources, and that it would, in fact, compel them to abstainfrom carrying out the very objects which they were constituted to advance. He looked upon the Bill as an open confession on the part of the GoverLnment that they were unequal to carrying out the law, and that in compliance with an unfair agitation on the part of the taxpayer they had consented to violate the sacred rights of property. He moved that it be read a second time that day six months. Tbe Earl of HARRowny defended the proposed measure. This country had rejoiced at thepeaceful state of Ireland. Would it be wise, then, if their Lordahipa threw out the Bill, to go on as at 2present .ompelling reluctanlt corporations to pay this impost against their wfill, and sO to excite that feeling of l eligious animositywbhich unfortunately hadsEO often disturbed the peace of that countryof The Bishop of KiLssoR condemned the Bill as calculated to inflict a great blow upon the interests of the Established Church of Ireland. It was most unjust now to seek to throw the tax upon the revenues of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, when they were wholly required for the erection and enlargement of churches. Instead of bringing peace to Ireland, he believed it would have a directly contrary effect, inasmuch as one party would regard it as a triumph, and the other as a most grievous wrong. After a few remarks from the Earl of Coax iu support of the Bill, and from Viscount D,GAI-oYN, the Earl of Wxoxnow, and the Earl of DONOUGHaioRa, who protested against it as both unnecessary and unjustifiable, Lord TABoT DE Max.s contended in favour of the provisions of tho proposed enactment. More would be done for ministers by relying upon private contribution than by anything which could be levied in thte form of Ministers Money. He was convinced that the resources of the Ecclesiastical Commisiioaera would be found sufficient to bear with ease the payment of the sum now raised under an Act which was odious tG so large a class of H= MAi =r's subjects in Ireland. The Earl of ELiLENoRoUGH said, he thought there was some difficulty in coming to a decision upon the matter before their Lordships, but, viewing the subject as a whole, he could not refrain from expressing his belief it was desirable that Misters' Mloney should be done away with once and for 11. He could not, howeyer, say that he quite agreed irith the proposal to levy the amount raised fLam the tax out of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who, so far from having a surplus, were, in fact, almost bankrupt. There was an extensive establishment to administer the Irish Church temporalities, by which great extravagaucies were committed, and the Government might effect a sufficient sawingto repleniah the amount of this tax by transferring the management of the temporalities to the -Irish Board of Works. Tn the hope that this proposition would receive the attention of HRan liTy's Goveza. ment, he would vote for the second reading of the BiLl The Duke of Nuwo.smL wa5 inclined to give his hearty support to the principle of. the Bill, aimd he should vote for its second reading. At the ne' time he couldnot'refrain from remarking thatwhile the law eeistad s itniiw did-it was the duty of the LonnD Thx-sui rn toenforce it; and,4withouiit-
There are people occasionally to be met with in a witness-box or at the bar of a police-courtmore generally of the sister island than of this Bceotian soil-whose talent is to involve a disagreeable fact in a cloud of more presentable circumstance. They are asked a plain question," Did you do so and so i" or, " What was it you " did or said on such a day, at such a place ." Instead of a direct answer, they begin, "1 Please "your honour, when I first came to this part of "the country I fell in with a man v.ho,"-or some such rigmarole, intended to paYe the way to a favourable reception, or, still better, an absolute forgetfulness of the one simple fact which the question was intended to bring out. The jury, or the magistrate, it is hoped, will follow the thread of the story away from his own mark, or will see the questionable point softened down under a silvery haze, or thrown into an uncertain background, or qualified by points of an opposite character. Just such an interrogatory is it that Lord GRANVILLE put to Lord DERBY last night, and just such a reply is it that he received. Lord DEBBY painted with the most flowing outlines, the most harmonious colouring, and the mellowest tints all that he had done in tines of yore towards settling the interminable " Pa" pist rersus Protestant" question. Beginning at the very beginning, and diving into the early days of O'CONmiELL, he related in what case he and his friends had found the Irish Church Establishment, persecuted, pauperized, helpless, and tbreatened with they knew not what fturther calamities. He then described what a comfortable, comprehensive, and, as it was hoped, copious fund he and his friends provided for all the wants of the Establishment, and placed at the disposal of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. He told their Lordships how pleasantly he had settled it between the clergy, the farmers, and the landowners, and how amicably they had gone on since. Then there had been for a long time a ridiculous and very tyrannical custom-law it could hardly be called-by vwhich in a parish vestry, at a certain point, the Papista went out, the Protestants remained, and, where they were strong enough and impudent enough, levied at their discretion a tax, or a cess, as it -was called, on their Papist neighbours. This Lord DEnBY and his friends quietly put an end to; and, as the clergy had for a long time contributed something to the same purposes as this cess was meant for, nothing could be more natural than to request them, or rather compel them, to pay the whole, and dispense with the tyrannical custom and its precarious extortions. Then there were at one time so many Bishops in Ireland that they jostled one another, and trod on one another's toes. In fact, Bishops found themselves very cheap, or rather both cheap and dear at the same time; for the Irish were resolving not to have them at any price. So, just to give them more elbow-room, to enhance their personal value, and aiminish their aggregate cost, Lord DERBY performed a little sum in episcopal subtraction, which consisted in subtracting I 0, and finding the remainder much less costly, and therefore much less offensive in the eyes of the Irish generally, Protestants as well as Papists. All this and a great deal more Lord DERBY told with a gay, airy tone, not without an evident egotism, as if he were rather proud of his exploits in that field of renown, the Irish Establishment, and did not care how much he said about it. It certainly costs an effort, and requires some hardness of heart, to pull so pretty a story to pieces; but it must be done. We will readily grant Lord DENRBY's claims as a benefactor to Ireland, to the cause of peace, and even to the pecuniary interests of the Irish Establishment. That, however, is not the precise question put to him by Lord GRANvThLE, which rather relates to certain particular measures promoted by the then Irish Secretary, and followed up by successive Governments. The Irish soil was once subject to certain tithe, the value of which could be ascertained every year to a penny. It was highly unpopular, and hardly collected-in many places not at all. So a forcible compromise was made, and the soil-that is, the owner of itwas excused a quarter or a third, on condition of his paying the rest in a quiet, gentlemanly manner. This was all very well, but, in fact, was a present of some hlundred thousand a-year to that distressed and meritorious object, the Irish landowner. Such was one of the achievements Lord DERBY is proud of. The soil had also to maintain the fabrics of the churches, and, though a church might want more repair one year than another,-and neither clergy nor congregations showed much zeal for church-building, or church-restoration,-yet the soil was liable to the impost, and in most cases did pay it. The cccupiers of the soil, 'however, did not generally like to pay it, and the Protestant owners of the soil were not at all averse to seeing their battles fought by their Papist tenants; so the cess was resisted. Lord DEBBY then abolished the cess, and, in order to find the money for it, he abolished ten Bishops, think-ing that of the two the churches were better worth keeping up than the Bishops, and a few Bishops more or less would not make much difference in Ireland. Operations such as these may be described in a very agreeable manner; just as in landscape gardening you may be led up and down all sorts of declivities, round all kinds of obstacles, and at all sorts of angles, till you imperceptibly find yourselves at a point which you would have thought it impossible to attain to without breaking yoiur neck or your wind; but the fact remains that Lord DERBY did these things, and they were the simaple transference of property from one class to another-from tbe church to the landowners, for the sake of the peace of the church, the people, and the State; and, above all, for the immediate popularity and security of the Government to which he then belonged. In every particular, then, there is the closest substantial resemblance between the measure which Lord DERBY found it convenient to oppose last night and those which he is proud to recall in his earlier career. Here, too, was the case of a tax laid by a tyrannical and very exceptional law on the inhabitants of certain towns for the maintenance of a religion to which they were generally hostile. From the first day of the tax up to the present hour its history has been one succession of struggles, fostered by friendly or conciliatory Parliaments. The payment has always been felt and claimed as a badge of conquest, and resisted or avoided accordingly. The last interferenca of the Legislature was one of those ingenious devices that atways have paved the way to a more final measuro. For the sake of a less oppressive practice ibh upset every principle. It made the. Ecclesiastical COmmissioners thi olhictors of: tihe;tax. Itr. raade a new valjmi,n instep,4 of. thet Exed =,;;'aad iCj excused the greater part of the payers, thereby presenting so much money to the landlords. The working of this partial remedy has been to aggravate tho demand for a whole one. Those householders and landlords who saw their neighbours legally relieved from the tax were resolved to obtain the same immu;nity. In Dublin, indeed, by some legal severities, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have obtained the money; but they could naot do so long, and in the other towns it is wholly and obstinately unpaid. As the case now stands, thle Commissioners pay the Ministers. The question, then, before the House of Lords last night :as a very simple one :-Is the proposed abolition of this tax and the payment of the Ministers out of the funds of the Commission as useful, justifiable, and necessary a measure as those others which have given peace to Ireland and comparative security to the Established Church ? The Lords have visely determined that it is. They think it better to prevent a nuisance, or rather to nip it in the bud, than to wait for its full development. They see in this measure a natural corollary to those former ones which the nation now regards with such entire satisfaction. The smaller question raised last night, as to the sufficiency of the fund for the purpose, may be safely left to the Commissioners, who will doubtless be regulated by public opinion. They will merely have to decide between churches and ministers, and the latter will probably think it b-etter they and their families should be kept alive, even if the Commission no longer build churches sufficient to accommodate every head, old and young, of the whole population.
Our Australian Colonies were for a long time undervalued as places of settlement for free men, and considered only as fit spots for the exile of evildoers. For the last few years public opinion has flowed in the opposite direction, and there is a tendency to predict for Australia a future destiny like that of America, with a population to be counted one day by tens of millions, a high place among independent nations, and the chief authority in the Southern Eemisphere. The truth lies between these widely differing estimates. Australia will no doubt become year by year a richer and more populous country; it may even take its place among Sovereign Powers, but it can never be a rival to the North American Continent. The climate is too uniformly sultry, the soil is too poor, the rivers are too small and few, the want of water is too generally felt, for the great island to be anything more than a desert encircled by a belt of cultivated coasts. The colonies which the British have established extend over the most eligible regions, and the shepherds and squatters have already pushed inland to the borders of the uninhabitable desert. There is no inexhaustible tract of prairies, no network of rivers bearing the explorer onward into the very heart of the continent. We are already able to see our destined achievements; the limit placed by nature is too firmly fixed to be removed by any exercise of perseverance or skill. However, Australia may be considered a great country if compared with the capabilities of DEiuropean States. The whole south-eastern portion, from Moreton Bay to Adelaide, a region many times larger than these islands, is fit for human habitatioli; then there is the Swan River settlement on the west, and a great extent of tropical country to the north. The two former of these districts are well able to stand alone; they are attracting a stream of emigrants, which is not likely to fail as long as the British Isles and Germany continue prolific countries and the colonies offer to the adventurous population the certainty of competence and the chance of wealth. But North Australia, placed within a few degrees of the Equator, is still a desert, and without the interference of the State is likely to remain so for many years. Now, while we are all looking for a place of deportation for our malefactors, and can Snd no spot but the banks of Swan River, it is again asked that Covernment should turn its attention to Port Essington and the Gulf of Carpentaria. The question in its broadest terms comes to this,-Is a tropical climate fit for a settlement of white men ? Were the Spaniards and Dutch and our own old English ignorant and reckless when they descended eagerly on Mexico and Peru, the Antilles, and the Spice Islands, leaving more temperate regions to be slowly occupied by the victims of want or persecution at home ? Does a colony in the Tropics involve necessarily the labour, and consequently the servitude, open or disguised, of an inferior race ? Can we, who have abolished slavery and pledged ourselves to the protection of aborigines everywhere, hope for success in the colonization of a coast in such a latitude ? The President of the Geographical Society, in his recent address, insisted on the propriety of forming an establishment at Port Essington, or some other point of the northern coast. The natural qualities of this part of the continent appear to be such as would insure success to settlers, if it were only situated under a more temperate climate. The harbours are good, the gulf extends 500 miles into the mainland, India, the Malay Archipelago, the Dutch colonies, China, and Japan, are all so situated as to make the northern port the emporium of Asiatic trade. The travels on which the supporters of the scheme base their arguments are chiefly of recent date. The Government decided, some time since, that an exploration of the interior of North Australia should be undertaken, and the task was committed to Mr. GREaoRY, who had already distinguished himself by a survey of Western Australia. The expedition marched southwards from the coast along the course of the river Victoria. The first great discovery was that the salt desert, which meets travellers moving inland from the south and west of the continent, bounded also the habitable regions of the north. It may now be considered as proved that " all the central portion of this vast continent is "an uninhabitable desert, probably the dried " up bottom of a sea, and that henceforth all "interchanges between our different colonies must "take place either along what, in a general sense, "'may be termed the coast ranges, or along the sea." While, however, North Australia is thus cut off from the other colonies, just as they are, to some extent, divided from each other, yet the report of the expedition is most favourable as regards the fertility of the coast districts. All the country between the Gulf of Carpentaria and the most northern of the New South Wales settlements was found to be more or less fertile. Though Government has not as yet moved, the colonists have begun to find out the capabilities of the region, and the eolurm of migration is pushingon steadilyfrom MoretonBay northward, until it is now within 560 miles of the gulf. It is stated that the banks of the nawigable river Victoria were found perfectly bealthy, and that recently our countrymen were stationed, there for months without the loss of a ma&. There certainly can be no &ubt that this fine indented northern coast miast one day become studded with settlements, if even the country inland be not colonized. Situated as it is in the track between the p-,esent colonies and India, to say nothing of the mother country, it seems pretty certain that tb e race which has founded Singapore, Hongkon g, and Aden will not be debarred by a trop jcld climate from establishing trading places in the most suitable spots. Why; then, sAould not Government. take the first step, and U34 th way~ eaier fo those who are 'to come afterwards ? One or more penal colonies on the north coast would certainly ao the rough work for the firt generation of settlers. As to the heat of the elimate, we think that, provided the convicts are not put to too hard and too continuous labour, there is nothing to be feared. Certainly it would seem that where men will go for gain they may be sent for punishment. The inducements to occupy this rich territory are indeed considerable. It is our only tropical land which is even moderately healthy. Western Africa, from the thickness of its vegetation, running down to the sea, and stagnating in lagoons allalongthe coast,isnotoriousforits deadliness. TheAmerican mainlandisnot ourown; and there is no part of the earth where we could try the experiment of free labour in a hot climate except this northern coast of Australia. We think that a trial at least might be made, particularly as the French have just taken possession of New Caledonia, in nearly the same latitude, and are about to establish something like our own systemof transportation.
The Royal Commissioners have presented their Report on the site of the National Gallery. The. Report has not yet been made actually public, but, as its general tenour is notorious, there can be no harm in anticipating by a few days the conclusiond of a document which are everybody's secret. The Commissioners recommend that the National Gallery shall be left where it is. This was the chief point at issue. Dr. Mnvi was, we believe, the only dissentient in favour of the more courtly theory which would have removed the Gallery to South Kensington. When this question was mooted some time back-just before Lord ELoHo obtained the Commission-we argued as strongly as we could in support of the view which the Commission has adopted. The only point which could admit of a moment's doubt was as to whether or no the pictures were injuriously affected by the locality of the present Gallery. If it. could have been shown that, apart from defective ventilation, from the imperfect construction of the rooms, from injurious processes employed in the cleaning of the pictures, there was really some injurious principle in the London atmosphere which was more or less slowly destroying these great works of art, no doubt the conclusion was inevitable in favour of removal. But when it was considered that immediately opposite the National Gallery stands Northumberland-house, and that the pictures in Northumberland-house have not become deteriorated in consequence of their position, although they have remained there for a much longer period than the national pictures on the other side of the square, a very strong presumption arose that it was not the general London atmosphere which was in fault. It is very true that the pictures in Northumberlandhouse have not been exposed to the same severe trials as the pictures in the National Gallery. The walls against which they are hung have not been visited daily by thousands of visitors; they have not, consequently, been moistened with the concentrated exhalations of human breath; they have not been exposed to constant vicissitudes of temperature which would act upon the varnish, and so let in mischief upon the picture. All this may be freely admitted, but the fair inference would be, not that the London atmosphere cannot be disarmed of its terrors, but that the arrangement of the rooms at the National Gallery is faulty in conception and defective in executionu. This we believe to be the truth of the matter. Were the rooms in which they are hung properly ventilated and maintained at an even temperature the national pictures would suffer very little damage, if any, from the London smoke. Any one who visits the Gallery must be well aware that the contrary of all this is the case. The pervading smell is almost as offensive as the un-Sabman odour which used to reign in the old Reading-room of the Museum. Now, that which affects the human senses in so very unpleasant and painful a manner can scarcely be otherwise than injurious to the pictures as soon as the mischief is let in through the cracks in the glazed surface. Apart from these general considerations of common sense, we believe that competent persons who have been charged with the office of instituting chymical experiments upon the matter have arrived at the conclusion that any deleterious principle which may exist in the London atmosphere cannot make its way through the coat of varnish, as long as this coat can be maintained uncracked. We take it, then, as a legitimate conclusion that if a TrriTA or a RArvABLLE receives any damage at Charing-cross it is our own fault. This question, then, of the immunity of the pictures from necessary damage being disposed of, we have to consider the fittest situation for a National Gallery on general grounds ; and there can, we think, be no doubt that Trafalgar-square presents the very best aituation in London for the purpose. We can to a certain extent sympathize with the views of those who would have transferred the site of the Gallery to Kensington-gardens, converting Kensington Palace into a fitting temple for the reception of these glorious pictures. It is a rich man's notion, and for a rich man by no means a bad notion. Undoubtedly, for all persons who had time enough on their hands it would have been well that the pictures had been removed from Trafalgar-square and placed among the solemn old trees of Kensingtongardens. The lounge would have been far more agreeable. Even as far as the more occupied and htumbler classes are concerned, they would have once or twvice in their lives enjoyed a run to the National Gallery at Kensington, as they now enjoy their rare visits to the Crystal Palace. When there the enjoyment would have been more perfect, and there are many considerations to be urged in favour of this view. These considerations are, however, overbalanced by the weight of argument on the other side. A mere romantic enhancement of the gratification which dilettwnti andt occasional visitors might receive from the leafy avenues with which the Gallery might be surrounded is surely as nothing when set against the fact that ten people would visit the Gallery at Charing-cross for one who could affond time or muster vigour to make his way up to Kensington. It is a most important matter th2k the Gallery should stand in the most central spot of London, and such, for the purposes contemplated, Trafalgar-square undoubtedly is. t. is, no doubt, a great mortification to our national pride that the National Gallery should wear so repulsive an aspect from the outside. Never was theme au opportunity so comnpleteiy thrown away. The site is one of the very finest in any European4 bown. The building erectedupon it,tlherefore, shouldbform an appropriate termination to that street wvich should, and, no doubt, will in time, be a most stately one. With Westminster Abbey and the Parliament Houses at one end, and thaeNationalGallery at the other, with Whitehall and tle Public Offices it esse and posse as ccanecting lnks, we surely here have the elemient3 of an architectural result which should reflect credit on the nation. What is to be done with the present building? If all the rooms were taken for national purposes, and the Academy were removed elsewhere, as far as in- ternal accommodation is concerned we might work | on for a time; but the building itself will never be ! other than a discredit to the nation.

The condition of his bequest to the' nation was that a gallery should be built by the mation, for. the reception of his works. The works we have accepted, but we have not built the gaUery. Why should England not have something at the least as fie as the Museum at Berlin for the display, not only of our older Art Treasures, but of the works of our native artists ? Were such a building in existence 'we firmIly believe that in a few years England would surpass every continental capital in her pictorial wealth. The Exhibition now in progress at Alanchester constitutes excellent evidence of the enormous mass of pictures of the very highest class actually in the country. There is, however, little or no inducement at present to offer gifts or make bequests to the nation. Nowhere would the pictures be so ill-shownnowhere would they be so likely to receive injury as when incorporated with the' National Collection. Still, despite of all these disadvantages, the names of AaGr.srTzx and VmNoK as collectors, and of TUXB as an ar£ist, are there to show what men would do under more favourable circumstances. Hitherto we have been as beggars craving for alms, and grudging the cost of thewallet.
LATEST INTEIGENOR THE ELECTIONS IN FRANCE. The Monitur of yesterday publishes a third warning to the Si:cZe. The decree, which is signed by M. Billault,. the 3inister of the Interior, says,- " Considering that the Government of the Emperor, founded upon the sovereignty of the people and on the principles of 1789, henceforth the immutable foundations of French society, can no longer allow the ideas of order and of progress which it represents, and the electoral body which approves them, to be calumnisted, the SiWcle, already twice warned, might ba prohibited Pi virtte of existing laws; but The Government, which has allowed the most perfect latitude to the electoral struggle, does not 'wish, although it has the right, to punish at the lose of this electoral contest even the most rabid organ of an Opposition, the bearing of which will be duly appre. ciated by the public." A decree follows, giving a third (the last) warning to the SidcIe.
AMERICA. [A summary of the following appeared in our second edition of yeterday:-J LIVERPOOL, JuNE 17. The United States' mail steamship Columbia, Berry commander, has arrived with advice, from New York to the 6th inst. She has brought $350,000 specie on freight. The Royal mail screw steamship Anglo-Saxon has also arrived with advices from Montreal and Qaebec to the same date. She has brought about $3,000 specie on freight and 195 passengers. The AngloSaxon spoke the Royal mail steamship Persia in lat. 55 N., long. 18 W., hence for New York. On the 6th inst., at 2 p.m., she passed the Royal mail steamship Canadian on shore on the Pillars, with lighters alongside taking out cargo. She was expected to be got off the following tide. The great event at Washington had been Lord NFapier's ball in honour of the Queen's birthday. The total foreign imports into New York during the mouth of May were only $294,143 in excess ot the corresponding total for last year, but were. $7,059,269 larger than the total for MIay, 1855, and $1,524,074 larger than for May, 1854. Only onethird of the dutiable imports were entered for consumption, the remainder (amounting to upwards of ten and a-half millions) being thrown into warehouse, to take advantage of the reduction of duties on the Ist of July. The imports of specie had largely increased, owilg to the demand for foreign coin to ship to the West Indies and South America. It was rumoured that ex-Governor Philip Frank Thomas had been offered and would accept the. Governorship of Utah. The Attorney-General had given anofficial opinion relative to the proprietary interest of the United States in the recently discovered guano islands in the Pacific. Congress, he says, may terminate the possession of the discoverer when it pleases. Under existing laws the discoverer is the nation's tenantat-will, and that will is to be expressed by Congress whenever the nation may desire to put an end to the estate granted; and the law forbids the President, before certain conditions are complied vwith, to declare any island as appertaining to the United States. The steam ship Louisana had been destroyed by fire in Galveston Bay; 11 persons were known to be lost, and a number were missing. The new Governor of Kansas in his inaugural message recognizes the territorial enactments; says that all constitutional laws must be executed; urges all parties to participate in the elections; believes the Convention will submit a Constitution to the people, and in that case does not think Congress will reject it; earnestly impresses the necessity of removing slavery agitation from the elections, from the halls of Congress, and from Presidential elections; says that slavery will ultimately be determined by "climate" law, and that it wvas this law now operating for and against slavery in Kansas. ln the event that slavery cannot exist in Kansas, he says that she has Constitutional duties in common with her sister States, especially MUisSOur. IHe trusts that her Constitution wi contain clauses for ever securing that State all her Constitationalguarantees,bothbyFederalandState authority, and supremacy wfithin her ow,rn limits, without the authority of the Supreme Court of the United States. He concludes by saying, that if the questions now disturbingthe territory are decided peacefully, he sees for :Kansas an immediake career of sure progress and prosperity unsurpassed in the history of the world; but that if they are not so decided, fraud, violenee, and injustice will reign, and history will record the fact that Kausaa Was the grave of the anerican Union. A Leavenworth paper mentions the arrival at that place of a Mr. Williams, who left Salt Lake City on the 15th of April, at which date Brigham. Young was carrying things with a high hand and driving the Gentiles away. Judge Stiles, the Unitod States, Marshal, and the Surveyor-General with his family, and a large number of emigrants had been obliged to leave the territory.

Ashes had improved, owing to the good demand, Coffee was higher, owing to the request for export to Europe. The transactions in cotton were extremely light, and the turn of the market was, in favour of the buyer. Respecting this staple the' New Orleans Picayune remarks:- " Without desirng to undervalue the argumentts of those who contend that the price of cotton has attained a pointat, which consumption must be curtailed, we still maintain that such views are wroog, and founded in apparent ,,uorance of tho mightycommnercialcbanges thathave been going on for years past, and wbiob, so far from having worked outtheir end, are destined to effect greater mutations hereafter. It is a singular fact that on both sides of the Atiantic we never hearof studied attacks directed against the prices of tobacco, sugar, provisions, and every article in the catalogue of trade, while we are continually bothered with calculations, disquisitions, and circuLar about the value of cotton, many of them going to prove that panufactureys cannot afford to work, that spinners are losing money, and that, finally, the whole interest is on the brink of destuction and ready to be devoured by some bank mnonster and other little fish. Sugar and tobacco have risen 200 per cent. within the lest few years and yeh a wil be obstinate enough to consume in equal quantities as before. Aud s it is with provisions and many other commodities. But cotton, say these politicalecononists, is dangerous stuff. If it goes up because forsooth the world cannot furnish t]e required supply, then everybody is threatened with some dire misfortune. . . . . . It is self-evident thatconsumption must be measured by the supply, bat, whatever that supply may be, it is certain to be worked up to such an extent as to keep stocks uncomfor'ably emall. The list returns of the English Board of Trade, in connexio, -with other reliable statistics, prove that cotton is being used hp, quite as extensively as before, though the deliveries eut of the Liverpool miarket do not establish the assertion, from the fact that spinners have largely drawn on their previous arrearages to make good the deficiency of their pure=se, sothat atpresentthey are not at a in stock, Surely it is not under such a condition of things, with all the spindles of the country in full operation, that people can gravely undertake to say that consum ption is about to be arrested by thepresent range of prices. The market for State and Western flour wa with-. out material variation. The stock wae reduced and. the receipts continued light, though, in the abseoe,c of any demand of moment for export, the offerings. were fully equal to the wants of the home trade. The low grades of Southern flour were a shadedearer. Wheat, owing to continned light receipts, a diminished supply, and a fair home tradedemand, retained its buoyancy, though there' was no ehange except on the common qualities, which were two cents higher. Some new Georgian wheat had been received at chrleston. Corn had a rising tendency owing to the' demand for home use. For hides there had bees an increased de.- "and, but without change in price. Iron continued dulL. Molasses were unsettled aud- lower. Turpentine closed frawly owing to- the small supply. Whale oil was dearer; lnseed was dull. Pork had, declined; beef was buoyant. Lard was easier. Saltpetre was in request. Sugarwas unsettled; the stock was large and increasing. Tobacco was in good deniand. Whalebone wesfirmer.

G1RAT H&31iEL FESTMVA.-As it has been strongly urged upon the managers of the Festival to arrange for an extra performance on Saturday at. a reduced price, it is right that it should be announced that it is utterly impoasible that the recommendation can be adopted, and that with the performance of Is2ael in Bqyptftis day the Festival will most certainly be brought to a close. AFvery large proportion of the performers, particulaly thechoral body,. is composed of personB from various parts of the country who have enly undertaken to. afford their services on conditioe of their being able,to return to their respeetive homes within the pyesent week, and who have provided themselves withrailway tickets whicbh would become useless at & subsequent date. These and other circumstancee. combined effectually prevent the possibility of any extension of the present arrangements.

FOREIGN INTTELLIGENCE. FRANC1E. (FROM OUR OWN COsRRPONhDM;T.) [L portion of the following appeared in our second edltion I)f vp-qLnrflnv--) PARIS, WzD.NzsDAY, JuIB 17, 6 Pr. The question of the elections is the absorbing one of the moment in Paris, and from all we can learn it has excited in the departments an interest if not o great, at least much greater than was anticipated in the eginung. The movement of the electors here begins to make itself felt. The numbers who take out at the Mairies their voting bulletins are on the increase, and this day a considerable crowd attended at the Mairie of the second arrondissement, where they received them, with the names of the Opposition and the Government candidates at the same time. In some cases the elector on receiving his tickets threw away that on which the name of the Opposition candidate was inscribed, andvice versd. Each party is naturally doing its best to awaken the interest of the electors in favour of its men, and addresses to the electors from both parties have already appeared in the provincial papers. The friends of the Democratic candidates appear certain of obtaining one half of the suffrages inParis. Others, not quite so sanguine, believe that General Cavaignac, M. Carnot, and M. Bethmont will alone have the raajority in their respective districts. Some add the names of M. Goudchaux and M. Vavin to this list. On this point it wouldbe hazardoiis to say anything positive. The addresses of the Opposition candidates for Paris have not appeared in any of the papers. The following is that of M. Laboulaye, member of the Institute, and one of the editors of the Jour)ml des Debats ; he occupies the first place in the list adopted by the Si&le and Debats. M. Laboulaye says:- "To TH EiLZcroRs or vus FIRaT CIRcuMscRIPTIoN OF PARI&. Gentlemen,-You have ever distinguished yourselves by the independence of your choice, and by your enlightened love of liberty. " It is while appealing to these recollections of a glorious past that I take the liberty of presenting myself for your suffrages. I am happy that the friends of order and liberty seloct my name, in order to recognize each other and to count their numbers. " My principles are the same which our fathers wvon for us in 1789-the same which France loved and defended from 1814 to 1848. Those principles have for 60 years been fixed in our habits. If you are of opinion that the moment is come when those principles can bo developed withoutdanger in our laws, and can obtain serious guarantees-if you think that moral interests require no less attention than material interests-if you wish that economy shall prevail in our publio expenditure-if you believe that the abuse of credit is as dangerous for States as it is for individualsname a Deputy who wiLl use in the Legislative Body firm and honourable language without his being suspeoted of ingratitude and forgetfulness. " I am the friend of order and of the laws, but in order to impart real and durable force to authority, in order to really secure the publio peace, there is no surer way than the sincere practice of well regulated liberty. I value my country sufficiently to believe that it really loves that wellregulated liberty, and that it deserves to enjoy it. " If these opinions are yours, and if you elect me as your representative, yom may rest assured that I shall faithfully defend the interests and the rights of my country. " I am, with respect, your devoted fellow-citizen, 4" EDOUARD LA.BOtULAYE, Member of the Institute." The following circular from the Electoral Committee (Democratic), and signed Garnier- Pages, Carnot, Rerold, Arnaud, and Lefrancois, has been addressed to the departments:- " Our friends have determined on action. In order to maintain in the Democratic body the union which at no period was stronger than at present, they have adopted the delegates of the Liberal press. The decree of the Court of Cassation permits everybody to present and announce his candidateship and to distribute bulletins. Candidates may propose themselves by observing the legal forms, but In this case the posting and distribution of bulletins are nmposiblb. In those cases where you have not Democratic candidates at hand in the locality, make a selection among the elected of 1848 of such as are likely to produce a favourable impression. " Yout must revivify the faith whioh slumbers, and respond to our appeal. Do not be deterred by the fear of compromising those xmies by ill-success, or by a small number of suffrages. Should there be but one voice to answer to your appeal the candidate chosen by you will receive It as a mark of sympathy, wil welcome it as a recollection, and will preserve it as a precious testimonial. Ambition alone fears defeat ; devotion may endure it with honour. " Universal suffrage is the absolute right of each individual. Proclaimed by the Provisional Government, it has not been conceded by any reginu. Every vote given in favour of Democracy will be the echo of past days, a consolation to the suffering, an alleviation to those who languish in foreign lands, and a source of hope for all. " This appeal, though restrained within actual legality, will not be the less listened to. A few days of common efforts are all that we expect from a devotion which Is not tried, from hearts which reverses have not subdued, and from a patriotism of which you have already given so many proofs to your fellow-citizens." The foregoing has not, of course, appeared in any paper. It strikes me as rather loosely put together, and as if some sentences in the original draught have been left out. I am assured, however, that it is genuine, and that the signatures to it are those mentioned at the head. M. Ferdinand Lasteyrie has published his address to the electors of the ninth electoral division of Paris. The following is the principal passage worbh notice:- " As for those who know me, a profession of faith would be useless. For others I wiU confine myself to saying-the cause which I have always served, that alone which I will ever serve, is the cause of liberty. My devotion to it is doubly acquired when it is suffering. All those who under any form whatever labour for libety, appeal to it with their wishes, and consecrate their efforts to it, are in my eyes friends and natural aUies." Count de Montalembert has issued the following address to the electors of the first district (circonscription) of the department of the Doubs:- " Presenting myself again for your selection, I do not think it necsssary to give a detailed account of my political opinions. Twenty-fLve years of pubic service in the Chamber of Peers and in the elective assemblies will suffloe for what I have been. I have not changed. I am the same man whom your free votes elected in 1848 to join those who then and since then faced the dangers which threatened France. I stiU desire what I then desired, what I strove for during the whole of my career, what I shall strive for to my dying day-the triumph of justice and truth by liberty and honesty. " If you have given up all your former opinions, then do not think of me ; my name would not suit you. " But if you think that there are stiU words of truth which ought to be said, guarantees to be required, rights to be maintained, reforms to be acquired, genuine ideas to be adopted, abuses to be corrected, taxes to be reduced, scaidalous speculations to be suppreased, the public weal to be watched over; " If you do not wish that aU the vital strengthof France should be concentrated in Paris; " If you stiU wish that your representative should maintain the independence and the dignity suitable to a public man; " If, finally, you still attaoh the same value to honour and duty; " Then I am again willing to undertake the task which you have three times intrusted to me. " Whatover may be the result of the vote which wll take place on the 21st inst I shal not the leE entertain deep and sincere gratitude for the disinterested votes with which you have hitherto honoured me, and of which mr conscience tells me I never rendered myself unworthy."- M. Landrin, in his address to the electors of Versailles, says- "A man of the Right and of liberty, I have devoted all my heart, my aptitude, andmy strength to the triumph of thwe grad principles consecrated by our Immortal revolution of 1789. This programme embraces all the rest. It requires energy, honour, and perseverance in the contest." M. de Benaz6, a member of the bar of Paris, offers himself to the electors of the second circumscription of the department of the Seine-et-Oise. IL de Gaste, late an officer of Engineers, has addressed the electors of Cherbourg. He says:-" I wish for all the liberty to which an intelligent and moral people have a right, and for the liberty pro. 2nised by the Constitution." The Univers recommends its friends to vote, save in a few instances, for the Government candidates. It says- " We have pronounced ourselves sgainat Inacton, and our views are generialy shared, we believe, by our friends. The Catholics wl therefore take p=t in the elweonap a, in spite of certain grievances, we believe that > r will vote for t1u eteejA~ of Gover ment. We a^4 F tia sd w tlrOf thr t bdo, .11 whn tI ra e _ q, bave to oboose between the candid&te of Government and a man who offers greater security to gonulne order. For instanee, at Besanson no Catholio elector could be blamied for preferring M de hMontalembert, with all bis faults, to his rival. At Montdidier, in the Somme, it appears very reasonable that M. de Morga, a resident, should be preferred to A. Delamarre, banker and journalist, unknown to the country. In the Bas-Rhin it is equally to be desired that the Catholics should either abstain or vote for some other name than that of Baron de Bussiere, the aggressive chief of Aisacian Frctestantism." The Cowtitutionnel is doing its best to induce the Opposition papers to declare whether their candidates will, if elected, present themselves in the Chamber and take the oaths. The Opposition papers give no information whatever on the point. They deny the right of any journal to put such a question; it is one to be arranged between the electors and the elected. This refers particularly to the Democratic candidates, who will only answer in case such a question be put by the body of the electors. Though the Democratic papers are silent, is is pretty certain that neither General Cavaigac, M. Goudchautx x. Bethmnont, nor M. Carinot will take the oaths. As M. Ferdinand Lasteyrie was one of the representatives of the Legislative Assembly who signed the demand for the impeach ment of the Prince President for the COtp d'etat, it may be presumed that he will also refuse. There are likewise great doubts whether M. Darimon, who represents the moral, political, and social doctrines of M. Prudhon, and who is adopted by the D9bcts, will take the oaths, or indeed any of the other Democratic candidates. It is admitted by this party that the great object it has in view is a manifegtation, and a lesson to the Government. On the admission of their men to the Chamber they are indifferent, provided they obtain the saffrages of the electors. An aide-de-camp of Prince Jerome, M. David, presented himself as a candidate at the present election.

I made a mistake in my last; it -was not the Kangaroo on board of which the slaves were foand, but the Brenda, which came from Tripoli with troops. The information about the slaves being on board was given by the captain of the steamer, and it was in consequence of this information that Captain Glyn of the Coquette, went on board. A s no arrangement has yet been come to, the slaves are still on board the steamer, where, strangely enough, they demand to be sent back to their masters: they will not hoar of anything else. This causes some embarrassment, because, oven if these slaves are handed over to the Turkish authorities, it is diffioult to see what these latter are to do with them, as they would be very soon in a far worse condition if they were turned loose in the streets, The frequent thefts, assaults, annd house-breakings which have disgraced the European part of the town have again brought the subject of poliee into the foreground, and a commission, composed of members of the different missions and of delegates of the Turkish Government, has been decided upon, to devise some means to put an end to this disgraceful state of affairs. All these commisions usually end in smoke. Each party has extreme pretensions, and neither wil give way one hair's-breadth. Thus, the Turks in this case want an entire revision or rather abolition of treaties and agreements, which, of course, cannot take place before the native tribunals are entirely reformed; while the foreign Ministers want to keep them in stabu quo, that is, with all the abuses which have crept in during the lapse of centuries. At the same time with the political part of the police, the military organization, which failed last year, has again been taken up. ahir Pasha, General of Cavalry; Ismail Pasha, General of Division; and Sefer Pasha (Count Koscielsky), a Polish officer, have been intrusted with the plan of organization. The new native Bank project is still breathing; it was reported dead some days ago, but it was a false alarm. There was another meeting on Saturday last, and there will be another on Wednesday next. The question of the Principalities, which excites so little interest in England, has monopolized the attention of every one in these parts. Financialerises, Ministerial difficulties, and railway schemes, however important in themselves, must yield the preference to this all-absorbing subject, and Ministers, diplomatists, and coffeehouse politicians watch with anxiety every new turn which this question is taking. This anxiety is natural enough, for every day it becomes more apparent that the decision on the future fate of Moldo-Wallachia wil scarcely remain within the limits of a provincial question, but is becoming more and more a question of principle, which is likely to exercise an incalculable influence on all the provinces of the Turkish empire in which the provincial spirit has not been extirpated by the pressure of the Central Government. By what mistakes of the Turkish Government, and through what other influences and favourable circumstances, a simply administrative question has grown to such importance, I am not going to discuss; suffice it to say that on the decision which may be taken with regard to the Danubian Principalities will depend whether the principle of nationality, which has lately so much agitated Central Europe, shall be recognized in the Turkish empire. If Moldavia and Wallachia were the only two provinces in which this national tendency was manifesting itself, it would be, comparatively speaking, a matter of slight importance; but it must be remembered that Turkey is a conglomeration of a number of provinces, not only geographically separated from each other by mountain ranges and other natural limits, but inhabited likewise by jut as mny difIeren -----;-- racs,spelcn ac thir ow agug e ferent races, aspealdng each their o'w-n- langagef, be longing to different religions, and sti preserving the traditions of a former time of national mdependence. It is true that none of these provinces have the same legal claims to a semi-independence which the Danubian Provinces had guaranteed to them by the treaties which made them vassals of the Turks; but, except in the immediate neighbourhood of Constantinople, where the ninluence of the capital absorbs everything, in all other parts of the empire the same tendency exists, and is growing, so that nothing but favourable circumstanes are required to bring Servia, Greece, and Egypt in the wake of Moldo-Wallachia. Indeed, at the present moment, when the future organization of the Principalities is only going to be discussed, signs of this nature are beginning to show themselves in Bulgaria,-5a province only separated by the Danube from Wallschis. I shall have to speak more at length of this movement, and I want only to draw your attention to the general features of it. Petitions have been presented to the Porte from a number of Bulgarian communities, demanding a national church government, and the introduction of the Bulgarian lmguage into the church service, which is now eonducted in Greek, an little understood bythe Bul- garians as Latin is by the mass of the Roman Catholics of Europe. This maybe sid to be a publi beginning, and in the whole movement the hand of foreign Influence iseail diornible; but all Intrigues wouldbein vain were there not matera eouh in the country ha acte upon. Beeldes this, Iu n part whife the GreekE linguage is dominant the Ifetairia has come to new life) and is working its way silently. - Now, in the face of - all these signs, nobody will be surPrised at the. anxiety with which the fate of the Principalities is watched, and at the interest which it excites in all parties. This interest found new food in the conference which took place hera on Saturday, the 30th ult. I told you at the time when the firman for the convocation of the Divans ad hoc was made up here that it was a very logical, but rather impracticable, document. The first step in the convocationnamely, the elections, already bears out my prediction. In the firman, as you will remember, the qualifications of the electors, as well as the mode of election, are most minutely laid down. This minuteness in form, in the absence of the vivifying spirit and of Parliamentary habits, is rather an impediment than an advantage, for it can never be carried to such a point as to exclude the various interpretations which party spirit may put upon the different points. And this has happened; the Governments of both provinces have given orders to have the electoral lists made out, and,according to the tenour of the firnan, the lists were published for inspection before the elections. The Unionists now complain that these lists are irregularly made up, that the interpretation given in many cases by the local Governments to the clauses regarding the qualifications of the electors is against the spirit of the firman, and in Wallachia numbers of petitions have been presented to the members of the commission, askming them to use their authority to prevent this ilegal interferenoe of the local authorities in the elections, which is expressly forbidden in the firnan. The Wallachian Government having maintained that their interpretation of the electoral qualifications was the right one, it was at last decided to refer the thing to the eonference at Constantinople which had drawn up the document. The answer which was at first returned from here to these reclamations was, that there was no necessity for a new conference and further explanatioas, as the Moldavians understood the matter perfectly, and had no reclamations to make. It became, therefore, important for the Unionists to get up similar agitations in Moldavia. This agitation has failed, and the failure is attributed to the reserve exercised by the Kaimakan, Elonaki Vogorides. The two cases were therefore united, and M. L 3 Sourel, the French Attaoh6, who has been sent by the commissioners who have taken the 1Unionist view, has brought at the same time the petitions from Wallachia demanding explanations from the conference, and the demand for the dismissal of the Moldavian Kaimakan. As some of the commissioners had adopted the Unionist view in the elections,a conference could no longer be refused, and, as you know, it took place on Saturday, the 3th ult. It is said there has been rarely a more animated conference, and all the members showed that they had taken the question very much to heart; the resolution adopted was, I am happy to say, a moderat3 one, leaving a door open for a compromise. In th3 first instace the reclamations of the Wallachian, were taken into consideration, and the commis sioners charged to make the necessary inquiries on the spot and give the necemary explanations. At the same time they were instructed to send the result of their inquiries and the corresponding explanations to the Government of Moldavia. On the other hand, the oonference came to the conclusion that the Kaunakan of Moldavia bad not overstepped the limits of his powers and that, if no difficulties. should arise in the meantime, he was at liberty to proceed with the elections. It is this latter decision, above all, which must Mell against the Unionists. then the agitation for the union began in the provinces the Turkish Governmen4, and those who took the same view as the hatter, tried to get un an agitation against the Union. This antci-Union agitation seems the most successful in Moldavir.. The argument used is, that by the union Moldavia would be absorbed by Wallachia, and follow entirely in the wake of the latter; and this, it is said, has excited that spirit of provincialism, which the Unionists say is ex.- tinct. In order to counteract the inluence which the anti-Unioniat movement might have acquired, it was important that the elections, as well as all the acts of the Divan, should take place in Moldavia at the same time as in Wallachia, as in this case the strength of the Unionists in the latter province could be brought indirectly to bear on Moldavia likewise, while the action in common of the Divans in-both provinces was, as it were, establishing the union defacto before it was recognized de jure. The conference, by authorizing the Kaimakan of Moldavia to begmithe elections, destroysthis unity of action, on which the Unionists had based no small hopes. Thus the affair stands at present, and the news that the elections have begun in Moldavia is daily expected here. - AUSTRIA. (FRoM oUB owN GORR]PONDXqT.) VIENNA, Jux. 15. Some private inteligence has reached me which induces me to believe that the question of the Danubian Principalities in likely to be settled to the satisfaction of all parties. The British Government not long sinoe proposed to France that the twoPiincipali. ties should be placed on the same footinginmatters of administration, and that a commercial and Customs union should be established between them. It was further suggested that, if it should appear advisable to the Powers, such arrangements might be made that each of the Principalities should, in case of need, furnish an armed contingent for the defence of the frontiers. It is probable that something was also said about a common occupation of any fortresses or fortifications which might be constructed, but my informant was either unable or unwilling to give me any further insight into what had passed between the two Governments. The plan met with the approbation of the Emperor of the French, who was probably glad to get out of the cul de sac into which he had been led by Count Walewski, and it wil now be the business of Baron de Bourquenay and Sir Hamilton Seymour to persuade the Austrian Government to agree to it. It is said that M. de Thouvenel and Lord Redeliffe have received instructions strongly to recommend the Porte to give its sanction to the project. A Constantinople correspondent not long since informed you that the conference which had been held in that capital had probably ended to the satisfaction of all parties; and such was really the case. Both of the Kaimakans received instrUCtiOnS from the Porte not to proceed with the elections until the conditions contained in the firmans relative to them had been interpreted by the European Commission. The Triesk Zetwnzg learns from Bucharest that the first conference of the Commission was held on Sunday, the 31st of May, in the apartments of Sir Henry BuIver. During the sitting the order of business was settled, and it was agreed that each of the Commissaries should in turn act as President of the Conference. Saafet Effendi, therepresentative of Turkey, will preside during the month of June. Two other sittings took place in the first week of this month, during which it was agreed that certain modifications in the method of electing members tor the Divas ad hoc should be confidentially proposed to the Kaimakans Unfortunately a marked difference of opinion on some points of importance has already been displayed by the members of the conferenoe, Some of the speeches made are said to have been more passionate than is becoming in diplomatists. The Jesuits are gaining ground here with fearful rapidity, and the children in the " Orphan House" (Waisen. Raus)-the offspring of Vienna citizens -are likely to be intrusted to their care. Not long since a Protestant lady possessing property in Carinthia promised to marry a Catholic, but the clergy have refused to perform4the ceremony until the bridegroom has obtained permision from Rome to enter into a matrimonial engagement with a heretic. It is stated that the Benedict in spem intends to remove all difficulties by embracing the Protextant faith. Lord Seaton is the s3cond of the English Knights of the Order of Maria Theresa who will be pre5ent at the great festival on the 18th inst.

- MONEY-MARKIEand OITYlZTELLIGdhFEN Thursday Evening. The Bank of England have lowered their rate o£ discount to-day from (i per eent., at which it had stood since the 2d of April, to 6 per cent. The reduction applies alike to discounts and to loais upon securities. The nature of the last Gcaette return and the anticipations of the favourable character of that which is to be published on Friday were such as fully to warrant an expectation that this measure would be adopted, but during the past two days a general impression had gained ground that a majority of the directors were opposed to it, and the announcement therefore came rather unexpectedly. Of the soundness of the policy there can be little question. The approved plan for the Bank is that, as a general rule, they should be guided alone by the actual position of their accounts from week to week, and, abstaining from conjecture as to the probable tendency of the market a month hence, be content to meet each change as it may occur. If in December last they had abstained from making a reduction, because it was pQssible they might have again to ret urn to higher rates, they would have needlessly added to the anxieties of the commercial world for a period of nearly four months, since it was not till the following April that they were compelled to resume a stringent course. Whatever may be the feeling, therefore, with respect to the future, the resolution now taken is to be regarded with gratification. Nevettheless it is satisfactory to assume that even on the part of those directors who would have been disposed to delay the movement ir they had had any strong misgivings as to its permanence, the disposition to confidence has prevailed. The worst stages of the Bilver drain to China during the present year are believed to have been surmounted; all the accounts from the mauufacturing towns of the United Kingdom indicate a desire to contract business within the safest possible limits, and the reports of the grain crops throughout Europe are most encouraging. Hence, although after the experience of the past two years no momentary mitigation of pressure should induce any one to countenance a revival of speculative projects, there is enough to inspire hope that financial affairs may be about to return gradually to a normal course. A critical period, however, has yet to be passed before the wheat harvest is secured. We have also 1,12a,0001. to send to Denmark, and the eagerness of the Parisian gamblers for another mania on the Bourse, under State auspices, is likewise an element for careful consideration. The discount establishments have lowered their rate of allowance to 5i per cent. for money at call, and 5i per cent. for deposits, with seven daya' notice, being a reduction of a-half per cent. The rate of the Joint-stock Banks for deposits will be 5 per cent. The finds opened this morning at the dull prices of yesterday, but experienced an improvement of an eighth upon the announcement of the alteratioh in the Bank rate of discount. Consols for the 9t of July were first quoted 93 to i ex. dividend, and they left off at 93* to ;. Money was not in exceisive demand, but business generally was languid. Bank Stock closed at 212 to 214; Reduced, 921 to j; New Three per Cents., 92i to 93; Indiabonds, 8s. to 4s. discount; lExchequer-bonds, 981 to i; and Exchequer-bills, 3s. discount to par. Foreign securities generally experienced an improvement, but the highest prices were not eventually maintaineL Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 964 and X for money, and 96i to ' for the account. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed bargains took place at 102 and 101k for money, and 102 for the account; Brazilian Five per Cents., 1829 and 1839, 100; the Five per Cents., 1843, 98i; Mexican, for account, 22k and 4 Peravian Fourand-a-Half per Cents, 77 and 77 for money, and 77 for the account; Portuguese Three per Cents., 46X; Russian Five per Cents., for the account, 110 ; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 98; the Small, 99i and 98i; Sardinian Five per Cents., 89i for money, and 89j and 89 for the account; Spanish Three per Cents., 42k and for money; the New Deferred, 26i, 26, and 26* for money, and 26 for the account; Spanish Certificates of Coupon not funded, 61 per cent.; and Venezuela, for account, 35k. The French Bourse opened this morning with great heaviness, at a further decline; but the news of the step taken by the Bank of England appears to have caused a rally, the final quotations of the Three per Cents. being 68f. 50c. for money, and 68f. 75c. for the end of the month, showing in the latter case an advance of an eighth, as compared with the closing price of yesterday. The anticipation that the Bank of France would lower their premium for the purchase of gold to the point at which it was fixed for a short time about March last has been realized. This step is of course a preliminary to a reduction in their rate of discount. The Columbia from New York to-day, the new steamer of the Collins' line, has brought 75,0001. At the adjourned meeting of the North of Europe Steam Company held to-day, Sir S. MX Peto in the chair, the report of the committee, an abstract of which was published in T7he Times of the 12th inst., was, after a long and violent discussion, adopted. The chairman of the committee, M!r. C. Iorrison, opened the proceedings by alluding to the disastrous result of the recent investigation. Although a loss of 1.36,0001. has been ascertained, it is still thought that with extensive modifications in management and a reduction in the number of directors the trade may be carried on at a profit, a recourie to winding-up being considered undesirable. It is stated that the transport service would have been more profitable had greater economy been exercised, and that the other branches have barely proved remunerative. The continued illness of Captain Andrews has prevented the committee from examining him, and consequently they have not been able to arrive at the whole of the explanations affecting his personal responsibility. It is thought, however, that the requisite information may be hereafter obtained. In relation to a proposed valuation of the fleet, and the difficulty in accomplishing a ready sale of the vessels, the explanations of Mr. MHorrison were received as satisfactory, and his proposal to continue the trade obtained the sanction of the great maiority. A long and irregular discussion ensued on a suggestion for an adjournment, and several of the shareholders desired information respecting the letter addressed by Mr. Colemau, the accountant, and forwarded to the secretary in October last, on the unsatisfactory nature of the accounts. Another proprietor considered that the directors having failed to disebarge their duties would, as honourable men, refund the amount of remuneration received for their services. The remaining circumstances alluded to were the sudden fuctuation in the value of the shares, the intimation by The Times of the neceasity for inquiry, and the manner in which that announcement was met by the board. The report of the committee having been received, and it having been aranged for the present directors to retire, Mr. Morrison, Mr. Young, and Mr. Yates, at the special request of the proprietors, agreed to take seats at the board, leaving the other vacanies to be filled up hereafter. Sir M. Peto at the conclusion of the proceedings, entered into'an explanation of the manner in which the direotors and himself were misled by Captain Andrews, and, while assuming the chief responsibility, be asserted that the mistake arose from his having entered into an undertaking the management of which he did not understand. With respect to the letter alluded to, he received it when he came to London in October, and, having consulted Mr. Coleman, his impression was that any loss incarred in the first would be compensated by the returns of the last half-year. Deeply as he regretted the result of this investigation, it could not be attributed altogetber to neglect, since he had usually seen Cap'ain Andrews, who was a very sanguine man, three days a-week, and had obtained regularly the particulars of the freight of each vessel and the estimated expenditure. His own personal holding of 20,0001. in the company had been increased to 60,0001., and Captain Andrewa, who originally was the proprietor of 100 shares, had augmented iii interest. Captain Andrews would, he hoped, xecover, and be able to enter into details to thro light upon what had happened.

A special vote bf thanks was passed' to the committee, and" fvotoe of 2thanks wms also ac-- I corded to Sir S. M. Peto for his explanation;. The India Compax$y have notifiedto the chairmaif of the Scinde Railway that the company will b6 ''allowed to issue additionl. shareq, representing 250,0001., on the same terms as. the first issue,. for the purpose of establishing a steam'flotillA on the Indus, to form a communication between the Scinde and Punjab lines. The African Steamship Companyhave iissued their annual report preparatory to a meeting ot the 24th. The directors are unable to declare a dividend, as, during the greater portionof the year.only four out of their six vessels have been employed, and the company has been exposed for the last six months to competition with a line of steamers running from London to the Coast of Africa. Having considerably. reduced their worldng expens they hope for bettN results next year. The accounts show a loss of 4,0751. Advices received by the Netherlands Land Company state that a second enclosure, comprising 1,760 acres of very rich land, was successfully completed on the 1Uth inst., making, with the enclosure of last year, a total of 2,850 acres completely reI covered. A dbcument of particular interest at the -resent moment has been published showing the arrvals of raw dlk in this country in each of the 15 years from 1842 .to 1856 inclusive.* The entire igures are too extended for insertion, but the following abstract embodies the principal points of interest. The flist column exhibits the imports from the various 6ountries in 1842,and in the next are those ofl0years latei, showing an inerease in the interval of nearly 48 per cent. The totals for each succeeding year aincethat period are given in the remaining columns, and these present a atilimore rapid rate of augmentation. The mnost remarkable feature is that, while China sent us only 180,1241b. in 1842, the supply furnished by her amounted to 4,576,7061b. in 1854, and last year was 3,723,6931b., notwithstanding the shipment of a large portion of her crop direct to France in consequence of the failure in that country. As this extraordinarytrade has grown up while thb rebellion has been. in prgress it should afford a warning to the dealers in Chinese produce generally not to trust too much to the probability of the existing war or any other political circumstances causing a scarcity. The next most important totals are those of Egypt. Fifteen years back-namely, in 1842-the quantity thence was llb. Last year It was 2,514,3561b. The East Indian aupply has gradually declined, the crops in Bengal for the past few years having been unatisfactory. From France, in 1842, we obtained 1,156,4981b., and in 1856 only 157,5591b. So far from having any to spare, her manufacturers were compelled to draw upon the stocks on this side; and the few pounds we took from her were merely certain qualities required for peculiar operations. The imports from Italy have been similarly affected. Those from Turkey have also diminished, but this is to be attributed to the French demand. Among the countries we have drawn upon are the United States, but the smaHl quantities obtained thence must have been of Chinese-growth. The supplies from Holland and Belgium, it is also assumed, must have come originally either from the Indian Archipelago or France. It appears that the largest importation ever known was in. 185, when the total was 7,535,4071b. Laot year, however, it was almost as great~ and, as prices have advanced in the two years more than 50 per cent., the money value 'was proportionately beyond all former precedent:- Public sales of silk took place to-day, and there was a good attendance of buyers, but the biddings were languid throughout, except for some damaged lots. According to a circular from Mr. H. W. Eton, the operations in ilk generally, whether by-private contract or otherwise, have been more limited than usual. * Silk.-Retum to the House of Commons, moved for by Mr. Hadfield June 4, 1857.

It has been foundne*ssary to erect these additional and expensive works in consequence of the improvements made m the process of iron manufacture, whereby the furnaces more than double the produce of iron. A new rolling mill is in course of construction, and this is to be the largest in the kingdom. It is to be driven by two steam engines of great power. The make of iron bars will be thus augmented to the extent of several hundred tons per week, an additional production, which wil eause the employment of a greater number of workmen.
LAW REPOBT, CO1MT OF QUEEIqSS BEVCH Wv mgq'wT1e .TTC 1R AMBLER V. ROMX. t1wutr C at Nsi PHrius, before fmr rustice WIG ETnAN and a Special Jury.) LIr. UoLier, Mr. Woollett, Mr. Worsley, and Mr. Powell appeared for the plaintiff; and Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., Mr. Lush, and Mr. T. J. CA#rk for the de fendant. Mr. PO'WELL, the junior counsel for the plaintiff, stated that this was an action of ejectment brought by the plaintiff, James Stephen Ambler, to recover possession of a house and land at Highbury, formerly belonging to Benjamin Ambler, deceased. Tho defendant, Thomas Rock, defended or the whole of the property. Sir F. TRESiGER, who appeared for the defendant, said he admitted the plaintiff was heir at law to the doceased. It would therefore be for him to begin by establishingthe defendant's claim as devisee. Thelearnedcounsel then proceeded to address the jury, and said the action was brought to recover possession of a house and other property at Hlighbury, which the plaintiff Claimed as heir-atlaw of Benjamin Ambler, who died on the 8th of March, 1855. The defendant, for whom he (Sir F. Thesiger) ap' peared, claimed the property under a will, executed by the deceased on the 14th of November, 1854, by which he gave the whole of his property t.o the children of the defendant, and in case of tneir death under 21 to the defendant, Thomas Rock, himself, aupointing the defendant his trustee and sole executor. It mist be admitted that the plaintiff was entitled to the property unless the defendant could establish the will made in favour of him and his children; and the question for the jury would be as to the validity of thatwill. He (Sir F.Thesiger)was surprised that the plaintiff should have incurred the expense of impeaching the will, seeing that an attempt which had already been made with that view in the Ecclesiastical Court had failed, and probate had been awarded to the defendant, and that proceedings before the Vice-Chancellorto appoint a receiver had also failed; and that the appeal to the Lords Justices had been dismissed with costs. The learned counsel then stated at considerable length all the facts of the cuse as he should prove them in evidence, but it will be sufficient here to state briefly that the deceased, in the year 1830, entered business in Newogate. market as a potato salesman, in partnership with his brother Elisha. The defendant, Thomas Rock, then entered their service as groom and porter. In 1835 Elisha Ambler died, leaving the whole of his property to his brother, the testator. The father entered a careat against the will, bnt the will was established, and probate was granted. This opposition to the will was a source of annoyance to the testator. Having retired from business, the testator's sister, a MIrs. Tebbutt, came to reside with him, bringing with her a servant, named Julia Wool. In 1838 Mrs. Tebbutt died. leaving all her property to the testator, and Julia Wool continued to live with him as his servant till the defendant, Thomas -Rock, secretly married her. When this became known to the testator he took a house for them to live in, and engaged them to wait upon him during the day. This continued till the year 1844, when the testator being disappointed by a Miss Windus, to whom he had made an offei of marriage, showed his revenge by bringig home a youn woman whom he had met on London-bridge. He lived with her for some time and then married her; but the marriage was not ahappy one, for the wife was violent in her temper, and there were frequent quarrels between them. In fact, he took so great an aversion to her that when he made his will, in 1845, he made no mention of her name in it. In 1844 ha had gone to reside at Highbury, and the defendant, his wife, and two children were put to hve in a cottage or lodge. In 1845 the testator calfed on a Mr. Broughtoni, a solicitor of respectability, of the firm of Broughton and Watson, in Falcon-square, and directed him to malce his will in favour of the defendant's son, John Rock. This.was accordingly done, and executed on the 31st of March, 1845. After stating some further particulars, the learned counsel said that in March, 1854, the testator again called on Mr. Broughton, and told him his wife was dead, and directed bim to make anotber will, which was accordingly prepared and executed in duplicate on the 31st of March, 1854, and the former will was cancelled. Subsequently the testator became offended wlth the defendant for getting drunk, and sent for the will and canceUed it; but on the 12th of November, 1854, when Mr. Broughton caUed upon him, he said the defendant had behaved better of late, and wisbed him to re-engross the wil of March, 1854, from the original draught. This was done, and it was executed by the deceased on the 14th of November in the presence of .Mr. Broughton and his clerk, Mr. Burton. The deceased had been suffering from ilness for several months, but, with the exception of two days, when he was delirious, it would be proved by abundant evidence that he was of perfectly sound mind, and not in the lea-t liable to undue in. fluence. The only thing that could be said against the claim of the defendant was that he was in a menial situa. tion, and that this was a very large property for him to possess. To set aside the wiU on the ground of undue in =uence the plaintiff must prove either fraud or violence, neitber of which, he was confident, could be established in this case. The learnel counsel then called the following witnesses, Francis Broughton, examined by Mr. ED%vUT JAMeS.-I am an attorney. I have been in practice since 1843. 1 prepared and attested this will, dated the 14th of November, 1854. It was also attested by my clerk, Mr. Burton. I first saw the testator in January, 1845. He came to my office in Falcon-square. He came to give me instructions for his will. I had not known him before. I do not know how he came. At that time I did not know Bock (the do. fendant) or his family. I took down instructions for his will. These are the instructions, in my handwriting. (The witness read the instructions for the will, leaving aUl his property to trustees for tho benefit of John Rock, defendant's son.) I prepared this draught, and read it to the testator on the 29th of January, 1845. He approved it, and made an appointment to call and execute the wili, which he did on the 31st of January. That will ws after. wards cancelled. It was burnt by me in the testator's presence. He paid 71. 3s. 6d., the amount of my bill for preparing the wilL I did not see the testator again tiU May, 1852, when he came to my office on a friendly visit, and consulted me about his wife. In Augusb he called about a lease to Mr. Taylor. I knew he had retired from business and was living at Little St. John's-wood, Highbury. On the 1st of Jul y, 1853, he caUed upon me about alterig his will of 1845. Hs e called again on the 4th of July, when I made a memorandum for settlement and wilL He wanted a change of the executors. The child was not to take the testator's name nor to bear his arms, and the estate was to devolve on Thomas Rock (the defendant) in case the children died under 21. He also spoke about a deed of gift. He was anxious to save the succession duty, which was then being discussed. He gave me instructions to prepare a settlement to carry that out. His wife was then alive, and I suggested he should make a provision for his wife in the shape of an annuity, and he consented. [Read memoran. dum]. The draught deed of gift was prepared, but it was never engrossed. He was to look out some titledeads, which he never did. I did not sec him again till the 13th of March, 1854. He apprised me of his wife's death, and wished me to call at Highbury, which I did on the 20th of March, 1854. I took the draught which I had prepared to accompany the settlement. He wished the second son (Thomas) to take equally with the other (John), and myself to be executor along with Thomas Rock (the defendant. He wished the will to be made as concise as possible, andI redrew the will in a shorter form. On the 22d of March I sent it with a letter for approval, and saw him the next day. He said he had beex considering the matter, and he wished Rock (the defendant) to be unfettered in the trust, to be appointed sole executor, as he knew the property, and he thought he would best protect the interests of his child. I was to take the wiU back, and if possible make it more concise. I remodelled the will, made it more concise, and sent the draught on the 25th of March, 1854, to the testator, with a letter [read]. Hle brought it back on the 29th of March approved. It was not altered at all. It was engrossed in duplicate, andahe called again on the 31st of March, and executed it in my office, in the presence of myself and Burton, my clerk. I took one part and he the other. It was on that occasion the will of 1845 was destro-ed in his presence. I saw him again on June 29, 1954, on the subject of his will. I attended at his house, in consequence of a message. In order to save the succession duties, he wished a deed of gift to be executed of a ortion of the property to Thomas Rock (the defendant) for the benefit of the child. I sent my clerk to make extracts from certain deeds, but nothing was done upon it. On the 4th oi July, 1854, I wrote a letter and sent a clerk to make the extracts, andcagain on the 5th of July, but in the result nothing was done. He sent for the duplicate wil about the latter end of August or beginning of September, 1854. Thomas Rock (the defendant) brought the message. I caUed on him in two or three days. He said he was displeased with Rock (the defendant) in consequence of his coming home tipsy, and he thought he would alter his will ; I was to leave it with him, and he would consider the matter. I left it with him, and heard nothing more till the 12th of November, 1854, when I had appointed to call upon him on other business. I found himill in bed. He saidthe defendant was behaving better now; he had cancelled his will, and he wished me to have it recopied and come up and see him sign it. I had the will re-engrossed from the draft, and on the 14th of November, 1854, I saw him execute the wil now in dispute. It is word for word the same will as I prepared on the 31st of March, 1854. On the 14th of November, between 7 and S ocolock, I round nia in bed. Burton, my clerk, was with me, and attested the will. The testator signed the will in bed. He was suffering from disease of the hip joint. No one else was in the room with him but myself and Burton. The will was read verbatimn, and we attested it, in his preeence, The defendant and his wife and child were in the house. They lived with him. The testator had desired the child to leave the room. He was 9 or 10. The testator died on the 8th of March, 1856. The will was left with the testator, and he placed it under his pillow. I was not present when it was found there. There was not the slightest doubt about his capacity. I transacted other business with him. He was a shrewd and determined man, of -whom you could not ask a reason. I saw him after that on business tiU within three weeks of his death. I had to apply to tenants who refused to pay rents onthe receipts of the infant. Re was 11 years of age, being born in 1843. I saw no signs of his inteUect wavering. Cross-examined by Mfr. CoIam-I now know that his ordinary attorneys were Messrs. Lake. I don't know why he came to me. By the will of 1845 the property went to the next of kin in case of the death of John Rock, and that the defendant had no other children. The defendant (Thomas Rock) took no interest by the wUIl of 1845. I did not know the testator except in connexion with that wiLl He came again on the 7th of May, 1852. I saw him three times in that year,-May 7, August 13, aud September 8. No one else was present. I have no letters from the testator to me. On the lst of July and the 4th of July, 1853, he called, and said the defendant was to take the property, if there was no child. I never went to his house till after his wife's death. That took place on the 1It of February, 1854. I went to his house in March. The defendant and his wife lived in the house, I never saw the defendant drunk, wor Mhm sad Ms-wife o violent I was at tie house about 2 tims I nevex sw anybody there but the defendant andshis wife and children.

I saw the testator first In 1852, at hea office, and often afterwards. On one occasion he spoke about the succesion duties, and said it would -make a difference in the way he should leave his property, as the duties would be 10 per cent., as he meant to leave it to tbefamily ofMthe Rock,or to Poc's chidren. H osaid he should consult Mr. Broughton as to making a deed of gift. in March, 1854, 1 read over the draught to the testator. He sail it was longer than he liked that in ttead of leaving Mr. Broughton joint executor, hi wished Tom (the defendant) to be sole executor. He said he wishe4 Mim to be entirely unfettered in the mamnaement of the property He told me to leave the drught with hi, and., to tell Mr. broughton to coe up a see hi. I engrosed the will, and on the 31st of March,1854, Isawit exeouted by the testator, and witnemed it. One was taken by the testator. I took a letter on the 4th of July, 1.854, sand found the tesator in bed. he was suffbering t a in hbis legs. He told the defendant to bring a unleo ded., whiich he had selected when'Ifr. Broaghton last called.' The defendant brought them. I arranged themi, and was' inaking extracts of the parcels, ~when the teststor wdsishd sue to desist, as he was insomunch paini. I was doing itast the foot of the bed. I had been there two hours The defendant was rubbing the testator's legs for half-anhour at a time. I saw the testator execute the.wil now in question on the 14th of November. He was asssted up. I was in the room half an hour. r saw him again on the 17th of February, 1855, id get his signature to a lease. He was in bed, and executed the lease. He spoke of his nephew Elisha, to whom he hadi lent 6004. He said he had sent for him, and when he camei he (Eliqha) asked how he was; that he (teatator) said he was better, and asked him (Elisba) whether he knew that that was t e day he was to repay the 6001. ; that Elisha saidi he could only pay 3001, and drew a check for that amountl and that he tnhe testator) tore the check up, and would have the whole. He said he would not have done it, but to show that he could do it in a business way. I never saw any weakness of mind or want of capacity. Cross-examined.-He said he should not have lent the money, but he wished to show he could do a business transaction in a busesslike manner. He said It was very likely his relations would contest his will, as they had put in a ceat against his proving his brother's wilL 'I said the signature to the lease was worse than that to the will. The defendant is a marksman. The defendantt hs not told me that he has kept everybody away, but he has4 told me that, by thetestators orders, he had kept away some persons. Thomas Rock, examined by Sir F. THGXB.-In 1830 the testator was carrying on business with his brotheri Elisha as potato-sesman in Newpate-market. In that year I was taken into their service as groom and porteri The testator also had a publiuhouse, the Sun and Last, in! Newgate-=ket. Eia Ambler died in 1835.

He had a sister, Mrs. Tebblitt She left her husband and went to live with him in Westi street, Hackney. My wife, named Julia Wool, was at that time Mrs. Tebbutt's servant. Mrs. Tebbutt died at Hack,, ney. Some time afterher death I married Julia Wool, aun kept it secret till the testator found it out. I went intc the employ of the person who bought the busineus in Newgate-market, and in about two years I went to live with the' testator. My wife was living in his house. My son was 1,4 years old the 27th of last ApriL The testator found outthat ] was nmarried. He found out that my wife was in the family-! way, and she told him we were married. He was not' angry. He put me in a house in Darham-street. We ath tended on him during the day and went home to sleep at night. He sent me for his nephew Benjamin, and I heard him ask for the return of a piano which he had lent him td save hiring one. The nephew said the testator had given ib to the girls, the Misses Windus. The nephew left the house and returned with Mary Ann Windus. She said he gaveittoher, andhesaidhe didnot. Shesaid, *Didyou: not offer me marriage as well ?" and he said yes, he did, and he would have given her every farthing he had in the world. After that the testator did not see much of the Winduses. I remember after this the testator brought home a person who afterwards became his wife. They did not live happily, but quarrelled a great deaL The lady wa very violent. I remember the house at Highbury eing completed, and the testator went to occupy it. I and my wife oecupied the lodge. I always accompanted himnwhen he wentto colleot his rents. He always drove himself The first time I went with him to Falcon-squar he said he was going to make his will. On another occa& sion he said he was going to read his willtome. Ho read it to me at the White Horse. His wife was living with him at that time. Oa one occasion I was called in. She tore his coat to pieces. My son Thomas was born at High. bury. NTone of the testator's relations used to visit him: except his cousin E3isha, and a nephew came sometimes, I never saw John Stephen Ambler, the plaintiff, till the testator's death. Heused to drive a cab. The testator said his wife wanted to get rid of me and my family out of the place. He would not consent. 3frs. Ambler diod on th 1st of February, 1854. After her death Mr. Ambler (the testator took me and my family into the house. In about a couple of months he was attacked with a serious illness. He was attended by Mr. Haynes and Dr. RoupelL When he got well he said he should alter his will, aud put the other boy in. He kept his bed eight or nine months before he died. He was attended by Mr. Neale and Dr4 Jefferson. My wife and I attended him night and day for eight or nine months. I did not take my clothes off except for a change, for weeks or months. I used to collect his rents at that time. After he took to his bed my son John signed checks for him. I recollect in August or September, 1854, coming home the worse for liquor. He said I ought to be ashamed. He sent me M3&0r. Broughton's to bring the will. He told me after. wards he had torn offhis signature from the will. He afterwards told me he should make another. Mr. Kesteven attended the testator for about a month down to his death. Croes-examined by Mr. COLIraR.-The property is worth from 8,0004. to 9,0004 a-~year. I am from Ireland M first occupation was washing potatoes for Mr. Ambler. I am now about 15. I continued wasbing potatoes for three or four years. I have never been discharged for drunken. ness. He has complained of my being drunk once or twice, or three times. I concealed my marriage because my wife was hving at Mr. Ambler's at the time, and I was not ready to go and live with her. I and my wife did not oppose the testator's marriage. I never struck the testator's wife. My wife did. The testator never said to me in Elisha's presence that I was a blackguard for strikingMhiswife. I never said it would have been a goodjobif he had losthis wife. I remember Mr. Beale coming from time to time to see the testator. On one occasion.myvwife, by direction of Mr. Ambler, shut Mfrs. Ambler out of the house. I did not strike Mrs. Ambler, bat my wife did; but she will answer for herself. When I lived in the lodge there was a servant in the house. After Mrs. Ambler's death we removed from the lodge into the house. I and my wife did not refuse to admit people to come and seo che testator for months before his death. I refused a Mr. Dean. I was told to do so by the testator. I also refused Mr. Burles, for the same reason. I never refused Elisha Ambler till afterMhis death. Benjamin never came but once, and the testator refused him himself. Benjamin Ambler, the nephew, and Miss Windus called about a year before his death. He did not say the testator looked stranie. Idid not say "Never mind him, he's wrong in his head.' I never had any talk with the nephew about what the old man haddoneinhis wilL Idid not say "Youare all right - your uncle has provided for you,"or " I wish I was in your shoes." I never hindered any body from coming to see him except by his order. I did not let any of his relatives know when he was dead. His cousin Elisha saw him half an hour before he died, and after his death. I fouad the will the night of his death under his piUow. I had seen it after it was made, when it was put under his pillow. Re-examined by Sir F. TAEsIGER.-When Burles caled and was refused I told him that the testator did not want to see him; he was to go to Mfr. Broughton.

In 1847 the testator gave me some bonds to take care of for my son John in case anything should happen to him before he came back from a ourney. He also gave me this paper.

Raymond L- Haynesexamined.-I am a member and Fellow of the College of Surgeons, and live at Holloway I knew Mr. Ambler from the year 1849 till his death. Mr and Mra. Ambler lived very unhappily.

On the 27 of Februry, 1854, I was called in to attend him, He. was suffering from disease of the heart,, and the poisonous effects of lead from drinking rvinwater from the roof of the houee. Mr. and M Rock both s4Fered more or less from, the same cause. For two or three days he was delirious andl unconscious.

He suffered great pain. I never saw any want of memory or unsoundness of, mind. HIe often conversed with me, and wished me to remain. He had great natural intelligence. He was most1 fully competent to any: matter of business. He had a& very strong will of his own. He treated John and Thomas as his own children, and called them "My boys," "cMif lads." I once recommended him a professlonal nurse. Thei next da he sad, "Julia's hand is better, and she thinks1 she get on without."' I have seen the deceased andl the defendanttalking about business I have not the' slaghtest doubt of his mental capacity. Cross-examined by lMr. CoLrr.-Dr. Jefferson attended, him twice.

Mr. Macrae, a surgeon at rahigton, attended the deceased once In FebruaT and severaltimes in May and June, 1853,1 also in AIpril, 1854. I also attended his -wife a great many, times. I never observed any incompetence. He was re-. markably shrewd, and one with whom no person could take a liberty. The Rocks seemed to be assiduously attentive. He was very kind to the boy, and said'he meant to leave him his property. Itold him itwsa pity the boy was not1 sent to a good schooL He assented to the proposition, but; said he could not spae him just new, and could not bear him out of his sight.

He seemed intelligent Andl nerfeetly capable of attending to business and disposing of! hsis property. Cross-examined by Mr. COLLrn-I thought at first iti was disease of the hip joint, but afterwardsl thought it was a tumour near the spine. If fever were set up it might produce delirium.

The Roeks attended to him as much as children to a father. When ho was not in pain~ he would converse on any saert, provided he broached it. He wes not likely to be iuenced by snybeody.

COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, WESThHsSTE Jum 1R. (4=fins in Barwo, before Justices CBESSWELL, WInIaS, ft.A W~TV The COURT to-day sat in Banco, and proceeded with the demurrer and special papers. PUGH V. STRINGFIE;D AD OTHERS. This rms an action on a guarantee for the completion of oertain hous, given by the defendants to the plaintiff and two other persons. Mr. ATHMETON, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Brandt), contended that the action ought to have been brought in the names ofWall the parties to whom the guarautee was given, Mr. FrEuD submitted on the other side that the penalty was distributable, and that the plaintiff might sue alone foi his proportion. The ComUT were of oplnion that the guarantee was joint, and that all the parties ought to have been joined. Judgment must therefore be for the defendants. Counsd in no other case being ready to go on, The Court, after striking out one or two demurrers for non-appearance of the parties, adjourned to the 25th inst. (S&Mngsa at Nisi Prius, at We-3tminster, after Term, before lfr. Sdiac CROWDER and Spaecia Jurics.) WA.Lr V. NEWBALD AND OTHES. The trial of this cause partly heard yesterday, was resumied this morning. Mr. Temple, QC., and Mfr. Keane appeared for the plain. tiff; and Mr. Sergeant Byles and Mr. Unthank were counsel for the defendants. This was an action on a bond for 1,0001., brought by Miss Walker, who during the lifetime of a Mx. Esam had been his housekeeper, to recover the amount of such bond from the executors of his will, The defendants pleaded among other defences that the signature of the testator to the document sued on had been obtained by fraud and covin, and while Mr. Esam was in a state of utter intoxication. It aupeared that Mr. Esam had beentwice married, and that while separated fromhis second wife he had engaged the services of the plaintiff to superintend his household, and that after the death of the last hlrs. Esam he hod evenmadeovertures of marriage to her,and in anticipation of such an event, and to provide against the accident of his death in the meantime, he had given her two promissory notes, each for the sum of 1,0001., one in sub. stitution for the other, both of which had been Astroyed on the execution of the bond novw sued oa. On she part of the plaintiff it was said that Mr. Esam had voluntarily secured to her the 1,0001. mentioned, in order that he might retain her care and attention during the remainder of his life, and as a compensation for her services and a provmon for' her maintenance after his death. Oa the other hand it was urged, and many witnesses were called to prove the fact, that the testator had fallen into habits of gross intoxiection, and was daily early drunk, later on in the day more drunk, and at night utterly devoid of sense or intellect, and that Miss Walker had taken advantage of this state of things to induoe him to sign the bond on which she now sought to recover. The evidence in support of each view of the question was extremely conflictfig, and on the last trial before Mr. Justice Willes (on whioh occasion the jury, being unable to arrive Pakny verdict, was discharged), was reported i The TiMrzq at somo length. Oa the present occasion, however, the question resolved itself into a very simple one, which was whether or not the testator was in. duced to sign the 1,0001. bond by fraud, and when in such a state as that he was bwapable of executing a legal binding insBtument., Mr. Justice CROwDER having summed up the evidence he juy begged to have the documents fwhich had been put n eidene hnde to hem andaftr aconsultation. boax, found a editfr the plaitiff for theaout The Court rose at 6 o'clock, this trial not having terminated mUntl that hour.

Serjeant Sazz, instating the case for the plaintiff, complainedof the act which formed the subject of the action as insulting to theplaintiffpas well as one unauthorized by law. The plaintiff was au attorney who had receistly -taken .a house in Hammersmith, in respect of which there was a claim for Is. for on& half-year's rent-charge, to ,which the defendant was entitled .as the vicar pf that -parish; and it appeared that the defendant haviiig anthd-rized his attorney to collect those dues, that gentleman had intrusted the discharge of bis duty to a clerk. It was: for the act of this person that the defendant was nowr sed, ana it appeared that there being a .claim for ls. due io the de fendant from the former tenant of the plaintiff's- housethe clerk called and proposed to thi ser7ant of. the plaintiff to leave-the notices with the serviee of which he hiad been in. truste.

His LoRtDsap, howeven, overruled the~ objections'for the present, the inclination of his Dopimion being that -the plaintiffhad established a cause of action, though he did -not feel quite confident on the subject. He would there:fore reserveleave to move the Court. Mr. BoVI-L then addreesed the jury on the merits of the case. The question was what sunm they would award to the plaintiff for this injury of .which he complained., ZHe ventured to remind the jury that the defendant was now sought to be made responsible in damages for a mistake 13nade by the clerk of hisagent, to whorn was intrmted the disagreeable aud difficult duty of collecting his dnes% ,often, as here, of very small amount. The law cbhaed the property, and not the tenant, with the *liablty to that impost to which the defendant, as vicar, was entitled According to the decision of the learnedjudge, the clerk had committed a trespass in affixin these papers on the plaintiff's house; huxt what injury7 ba bhereewived?

The queston was whether this omission was such an act of negligence as to make it a criminal act. The case was arg sed some time since, and time was taken by the Court to cosdr its judgment. Lord CArnBELn now delivered judgment. The neelect of the prisoner to perform his duty had led to the death of the deceased. If this had been a malicious act it would1 have been murder, but if it was an act of negligence it ther became manslaughter. The conviction must be affirmed. Conviction afirmed. THE QVEM V. JOHN DANGER. This case was argued a short time since, and the questiorn was whether the document obtained was a valuable security. It was a biU of exchange drawn by the prisoner ancl presented to the prosecutor for acceptance; he accepted it, and the prisoner obtained it. Lord sJAaIBELL delivered judgment. The Court was of opinion that the offence charged and proved did not come within the statute of the 7th and 8th George IV. It nust have been the property of some one other than the prisoner; there was great difficulty in saying that as against the prisoner the prosecutor had any property ln this paper. It must have been a valuable secrity when in the hands of the prosecutor; when in the hands of the prosecutor it wras of no vralue to him or- to any one else.

Mr. Commissioner Evans thereupon granted a warrant. Mr. Smith was now present, and Mr. K. Lane, his attorney, made affidavit to the effect thatthe reason Mr. Smith was not in attendance on the last occasion was that he had misunderstood the meeting would be held on the 15th, and not on the 13th of June. Mr. BAGrEY, for the assignees, said they had net enforced the warrant. The summons had distinctly required Mr. Smith to produce all books and papers. He had4 furnished au acoount, in which he admitted having received 1,5751. from Robson, and he accounted for the application of the money in a vaziety of items, showing only a balance of 781o 6s. Sd. Mr. Mount, solicitor to the assignees, had also specifically addressed Mr. Iane, Mr. Smith's solicitor, requiring the books and vouchers. Mr. STUEGEON, for Mr. Smith, said it was impossible to produce all books and papers Mr. Smith observed that part of the vouchers were in Dorsetshire. He would be ready with them in a week. He had been laid upon a bed of sickness for 17 days, and it would require some time to dispose of his present engagernents. Mr. BAGLEY suggested that M1r. Smith should intrust some one with the key of his drawers in which the vouchers 'were kept. Mr. Smith said he could not exactly say where the vouchers 'were. He had let his house at Chelsea; he had let Drury-lane Theatre, and he must ascertain what vouchers there were at both of these places. Mfr. BAGIMy.-But you have made up the account with apparent particularity. Mr. Smith said the account had beeu made up for some time, at least in penciL The books from which that account Was made out were in Dorsetshire. Mr. BAGLEY.-We shall want the checks. lMr. Smith.-Oh ! Ican get them from my banker's. Mr. BAGLEY.-We had better have all together, as 'we cannot go into the examination without. Mr. Smith.-I must throw myself upon the kindness of the Court not to detain my books and papers when I produoothem, asIaum onstantly referring to them as to the state of my accounts writh Drury-lane Theatre. Mr. BAoI1y.-Oh, certaidr not. We only wish to check them 'with the official assignee. The examination of Mr. Smith was then fxed for the 30th inst. (Before Hr. Comnmistoner PAxN) In BE J. P.

INSOLVENT DEBTORS' COURT, June 18. _L RE WILLIAM GODDARD. (Before Mr. Corminiioner PRTT.T.TPQ I d nas msoLvent4 an old man, 77 years of age, applied to be discharge d Mr. Sargood opposed on behalf of the detaining creditor, hlr. Stapleton. It appeawed from the statement of the learned counsel that the mnsolvent had for many years cultivated a slip of land adjoining Richmond Park called the Deef's Leap. Mr. Stapleton had recently purchased same adjoining property, across which the insolvent claimed rights o~f way. Two -actions were tried in order to decide the rights of the parties. In one the insolvent was successful, and in the other Mr. Stapleton recovered a verdict. It was on account .of the costs in the latter action that the insolvent was now in custody. Upon being examined the insolvent said he had held the Deer's Leap land since 1823, when it was let to him by Lord Duncannon, who was then the Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests. 'he opposing counsel desired to see the instrument under which tha land was held, but that documnent was not in court, and Mr. Commissioner PUnLIrPS adjourned the case antil Monday for its production. IN RE EN'RY PARRY. This insolvent, a publican. had kept the Coach and Horses publichouse, in Holborn. He was opposed by two creditors, the holders of bills of exchange, bearing his name, which they had discounted. It appeared that the Insolvent had signed his name to a great number of bills for the accommodation of his brother-in-law, a person named Spiler, who was not now to be found. Mr. Commissioner PI{mLips said a man had no right to become answerable for the debts of others when he could not pay his own. In this case the insolvent had chosen to sundertake responsibility to the extent of 5701. for Spillar, *and, as such conduct was highly reprehensihle, his discharge would be delayed until the expiration of six months from the date of the vesting order.

The association had the inisfortune to differ from Lord Palmerston on certain points, his Lordship attributing the mutrders which were perpetrated at Cantoi iss IS4S to the temzierity of the British residents, ratber than to any want of foresigbt or precaution on the part of Tier Mlajesty's representative on the station, and the association rather inclining to be dissati.fied with the conduct of Sir J.

V.(T=*ZVRl=JULwi COUR, .TjuN8f81. OiD) COURT. ¶WJbre Afr. Baron WATSON.) Edwin Lofting, 15, who had pleaded "guilty" to a obare of sealing two post letters containing money, was brought up for judgment. Mr. OOrPER, who appeared for the prisoner, stated that he had hitherto borne a most excellent character, and his family were very respectable. He was in tbe service of a chymist, who was also a receiver of post letters, and the risoner had been imprudently allowed to deal with the letters, and it appeared that he could not resist the temp. tation that was thus afforded him, and stole two letters contning money. Under these circumstauces the learned connsel said he hoped the Court would not feel it to be in. consistent with its duty to pass a lenient sentence. Mr. BOD1;N, who appearedfor the Post-office authorities, explained to the Court that it was contrary to the regula tions of the Post-office for any person of the age of the risoner to be allowed to have anything to do with the =etters, and he said that the postmaster had been dismissed from his office for his neglect of duty in this respect. Mr Baron WATrso said thatthe offence of stealing letters sent through the post was a very serious one, and must be put a stop to. He was afraid, from what he saw in the depositions, that the offences to which the prisoner had pleaded guilty were not the only ones that had been committed by him; and, taking into consideration aU the facts, he should sentence him to be kept to hard labour for four months, and then to be sent to a reformatory sobool for five years. His Lordship at the same time explained that if he conducted himself well, and showed that he might safely be set at liberty, the Secretary of State might at any time order his dlscharge. THE ISLINGTON NIURDER. Robert Robinson Tripp, 62, a peculiar-looking old man, was indicted for the wilful murder of James Scotk. Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Robinson conducted the prosecu ion. The prisoner was defended by Mr. Metcal2e and ir. Orridge. The learned counsel for the pru_--ution, in opening the case to the jury, said that he and his learned friend appeared by direction of the Secretary of State to prosecute upon public grounds, and the inquiry into which they were about to enter was undoubtedly one of the most sorious character, and in which the life of the prisoner was involved. He then proceeded to give a brief outline of the facts of the case as they afterwards appeared in evidence, and the following witnesses were examined:- Mr. Edward Silence said,-I reside at No. 28, Giffard. street, Caledonian-road, Islington. The prisoner lived in the same house, on the second floor. I was awoke about half-past 2 in the morning of the 7th of April by hearing, a noise on the prisoner's floor, and I got out of bed and unlocked the door. I then heard the deceased say something, and I went up to the second floor and saw the prisoner and the deceased standing there. The deceased had called to me to come upstairs When I got upstairs the prisoner asked me for a light, and I went down and procured one. I was not gone more than two or three minutes, and when I went up again I gave the light to the prisoner. The prisoner and the deceased were still standing on the landing. The prisoner then unlocked the door of his room and went in. I heard the prisoner and the deceased talking very loudly, as though they were quarrelling, before I went up the first time. I wentinto the prisoner's room after he had taken the candle, and I saw him take up a sword that was either lying upon a table or on a box. I caunot say whether it was ina sheath or not. (The sword was produced and identified by the witness.) When the prisoner had picked up the sword he rushed at the deceased and stabbed him in the body with it. The deceasedwas standingtwo or three steps from the door of the prisoner's room, and I was between them. He was standing quite still, and apparently in the act of reading a paper that was in his hand, and which seemed to be a notice of some kind. Tne deceased exclaimed, " I am stabbed;" and the prisoner made another stab at him with the sword, but I warded it offE Mr. Scott staggered, and I assisted him dowu stairs and went for a doctor. The prisoner remained in his room, and I did not see him again until he was at the station-house. I have known the pri. soner nearly 12 months. He was in the habit of coming home at all hours of the night. The deceased was the landlord of the house, and he had a key of the street door, so that he could go in whenever he pleased. Cross-examined.-The deceased did not live in the house. He was about 33 years of age, and was a tall powerful man. I have not seen him very violent on any occasion. The prisoner had been in Messrs. Cubitt's service, and was iu the receipt of a pension from that firm. He was very civil when he was sober, bht he was excitable when under the influenoe of drink. I am not aware of his having any resent. ment against the deceased. I am quite sure it was the voice of the deceased that I first heard; but they might have 1-oth caled out nearly together. As soon as Itook up the light the deceased produood the notice and began to read it to the prisoner. It was a distress paper or something of that sort. Re.examined.-The prisoner might have been drinking. but I do not think he was tipsy. I did not sce the deceasea attempt to use any vnolence towards the prisoner. he had nothing in his hand but the notice paper. By the CoUtT.-Notlhing whatever passed in my presence between the deceased and the prisoner before the former was stabbed. Benjamin Hall, a polioe-constable of the N division, said, -On the 7th of ApriL about 3 o'clock in the morniDg, I went to the house in Giffard-street, and I found the prisoner in the front room of the second floor. Iknocked atth door, and the prisoner asked who was there. I said, "The police," and he rephed. "My door is not locked; come in." I then opened the door, and saw the prisoner sitting by the fireplace smoking a pipe. The sword was by hs side, in a sheath, leaning against the wall, I asked him what disturbance had Men place between him and Mr. Scott, and be said Mr. Scott was his landlord, and he owed him some rent, and he had come to him at a very unseasonable hour for the rent, and he told him if he would come on Saturday he would pay him, and that Scott replied he would not wait till then, and tried to force his way into his room, and he tried to push him out, but he would not go out, and he then stabbed him. I asked the prisoner what he stabbed him with, and he said "I stabbed him with a cutlass; and I hope I have given him his death wound. If it had not been for Mr. Sile ce I would have cut his head off." He then asked me if I was going to lock him up, and I told him I had only come to speak to him, and I wanted him to go and see Mr. Scott, and he said he would do so. The prisoner still remained sitting in the ohair, and he inquired If Mr. Scott was hurt much, and I said I believed that he was. He then asked if he was dead, and I told him he was not. He replied " I am sorry for that. Iam sorry I have not given him his death wound." I and an officer who accompamed me seized the cutlass and a knife that was upon the table, and I then told the prisoner that he was in my custody, and we conveyed himu to the station-house. As we were going along the prlsoner repeated that he was sorry he had not given the deceased his ' eath wound. The cutlass was bloody. About half-past 11 &clock the same evening I saw the prisoner and the de. e ased standing together at the corner of the Caledonlanroao, and they appeared to be jangling and quarrelling to. gether. I saw the deceased again about 2 o'clock standing near the house in Giffard-street, and he made some inquiry of me respectinr the prisoner. Cross-examined-The deceased appeared to be v.aiting for the prisoner, and he asked me if I had been that old vagabond he was talking to, and he said tbat Tripp owed him some rent, aud he intended to wait tiU he came home. enter the house with him, and remain there till the morning and then put the brokers in. When I Paw the prisoner and the deceased talking together neither of them appeared to be excited, but they seemed to be wrangling. The prisoner might have had a little to drink, but he was not drunk. George Beckley, a police sergeant, said,-I was at the police station when the prisoner was brought in, and the constable charged him with stabbing Mr. Scott. I asked where Mr. Scott was, and the constable said be had been talken to the hospital. The prisoner then exclaimed, "-I (id it.' I cautioned him, and he then said, " If it had not been for the lodger I would have given him a right one, and then a left one, so that there would have been no occasioa to take him to the hospitaL" IHe added that be considered he was quite justified in doing it, as Mr. Scott had no right to come to him at.suoh an unseasonable hour for his re,-. The witne-s Silence came in at this moment, and th. pri. sriner addressed him and said, " If it had not been f .r you, interference I would soon have finished him." SoBething was then said about the wound being an inch and a-half deep, and the prisoner said he wished it had been six incheb deep. George Willis said,-f am a house agent, and I know the prisoner and the deceased. I saw the prisoner at the house in Giffard-street on the 3d of April, and I had some conversation with him upon the subject of a distress that hai been put in by the deceased in the previous month of Novemiber. He asked nle if I had seen or heard anything of Scott. I told him I had not. He then said, "4 You kny w how he served nie last time, and how he drove me to verv great ex pedse, for which I have not forgotten him." I told him it had passed over, and he bad better not think any more about it. He replied that he could not do th,t. I then said that when landlords and tenants disagreed they were riuch better apart, and that if I were the prisoner I would leave. The prisoner said he should not leave untU be pleased, and the deceased should not do as he liked with him. I told him that he appeared to be working himself up to a btate of excitement, atnd he had better go away. The prisoner said he should not, and added, "If be attempts to do such a thing again. I will serve them both out and give tbem something that they shan't forget." The prisoner appeared a good deal excited, and I again advised him to leave the house, and he said be would not go until he l'ked. I informiied the prisoner afrer he was in custody that Mr. Sott was dead, and he said he was sorry to hear he was dead, and he did not thilk that he had " pricked him sO sharp." hIr. Siifant, the surgeon to whom the deceased was taken after the occurrence, said that he at once found it was a most dangerous case, and he directed the decea6ed to be immediately removed to his own house, and he attended bini there until tiis death. He discovered that there was a wound in the abdomen, and upon a post mortem examination he ascertained that a Portion of the bowels bad 'oeen severed, and this injury was the cause of death. The wound was sujoh an one as might have been produced by a weapon like the cutlass found in the prisoner's room. In answer to. a question put by Mr. AMFETc.4rE, the witness said that he asked the decease1 who had done it, and he replied, " That oldvillain Tripp."' Mr. METCALE then made a most earnet appeal to the jury on behalf of the prisoner, and eaid he trsisted that when they came to look at all the facts connected with this melancholy case they would comae to the conclusion that they were not called upon to return a verdict that would have the effect of consigning the wrethebd old man at the bar to the sca6bld, and thus cause the destruction of another hum" life ia Addition to the onx that had already undoubtedly beeu acrificed in this shocEing afair. It 'would, of course, be useles for him to endeavour to deny that the unfortunate deocased hbad met his death at the hand of the prisoner, but it appeared to himu tobe clearly mrae out by the evidenoe that the decessed had to a great extent brought the melaneholy result upon himself bv his own illegal and violent conduct. He was proved to nave been a young, powerful man, and the proceeding he adopted of going to the prisoner's room with the intention of remaining there al night WaS most unjustifiable and illegal and if he resorted to any violence, which he submittej he most probably did, the prisoner would have been justified in resisting such violence, and if the fatal wound was inflicted under such circumstances it would relieve the prisoner from the cbarge of wilful murder, and the jury would be justied in finding him guilty of manslaughter. The learned coumsel then proceeded to comment upon the facts of the case, and he urged that there was no evidence to show any malice or, the part of the prisoner, and that the fatal affair would, in all probability, never have oocurred if the deceased had not taken the iUegal and improper course of going to the prisones rcom in the dead of the night and actbng in the mat ner described. Mr. Baron WATSON, in gumming up, s%id that the onlr question the jury had to decide was whether the act which was undoubtedly committed by the prisoner ammunted to the crime of wilful murder or to the minor offenca of uauslaughter only, aud in coming to a decision upon ibat qr.stion they must be guided by tho evidence alo,ic, and Aot allow any feeling of sympathy or charity to operate in giving their verdict. Hisbord, bV then dire.ted the attention of the jury to the mateiial I *r ioas o; the evidence, and said he thought it right to) ir uV *e:. that the act of the deceased in going to. theo I teti h of the S~~~~r._ - -% - .rtment in the dead of tLhe night, in . er aiStrain upon his oods for rent wa3 -mdoubtedly illegal and if he nattempted to 'u se his way into the prisoners room the prisoner wouid have been justified in resisting Wss doing so. and, although the law would not sanotion the ulse of a deadly weapon in such a case, Eo as to ex- useethe party altogether, yet, if it was made use of in the heat of the moment, it would, in his opinion, reduce the offence to manslaughter if death ensued. - The jury, after a very short deliberation, Aecuittd the prisoner of wilful murder, and found him Guity of mauslaughter. The learned JUDGE, in p;ssirig sentence, told the prisoner that the jury had taken a very charitable view of his case in finding him guilty of the minor offence of man'slaughter, but, although ha thought they had come to a right conclusion in the absence of any positive evidence as to what really took place before the fatal wound was infiicted, yet he could not help regarding the offence as one of a very aggravated character. 'The law of England did sot allow any man to make use of a deadly weapon except it was absolutely necessary for the protection of his own life, and the jury had come to a most merciful conclusion in acquitting him of the crime of murder. He hoped that during the period of punishment he would have to uzdergo he would s=ncerely repent of his crime, but he fetb it his duty, under all the circumstances, to order him to be kept in penal servitude for eight years. Charles Melbourne, 27, a respeotable-looking young man, was indicted for feloniously shooting William Murrell, with intent to murder him. Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Robinson conducted the prosecution. The prisoner was defended by Mr. Metcalfe. Mr. BODi , in opening the case to the jury, said that the offence imputed to the prisoner by the present indictment was one of a most serious character. The prosecutor was a constable belonging to the metropolitan police, and it appeared that on the moraing of the 6th of June a sergeant named Crocker, belonging to the same force, saw the prisoner in the Haymarket in company with another man, and, having reason to believe that he was a man who was " wanted," as it was termed, for a burglary, he sent for the prosceutor Murrell, who was acquainted with his person, and upon his coming he recognized the prisoner, and the two constables took bim into custody. When they had proceeded a short distance towards the poltce-station Crocker left the prisoner in the charge of Murrell, while he went in search of the other men, but he had only gone a few paces when he heard the report of a fire. arm and a cry for assistance from his brother constable, and on running back he saw that he was wounded in the face and the prisoner pointed a second pistol at him aud discharged it, but fortunately without doing him any injury. Crocker and Murrell, the two constables, were then examined, and they proved the above facts. The latter stated that the moment he was left alone with the prisoner he saw him raise his hand towards his face, and at the samae instant the pistol was discharged, and he felt himself wounded. He wrenched this pistol from his hand, but the second pistol that was discharged at Crocker was not found 'When the prisoner was searched there were found upon him a number of shots, a bowie knife, some percusion caps, four pebbles that fitted the pistol, two lucifer matchboxes, and lls.in money. Mr. A lin, house surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital, proved that he examined the prosecutor, and found a wound in the left side of his chin, and, upon probing it, he discovered the existence of some foreign obiect, which he extracted, and which turned o01t to be a small pebble. He said he was of opinion that there was very little ganpowder in the pistol at the time it was discharged, and in consequence of the vtant of force the pebble was stopped by the jawbone and driven back into the cheek. Mr. M=rcALFE addressed the jury for the prisoner, and, without attempting to deny the facts, contended that the only object the prisoner had in view was to endeavour to escape from custody, and that he had no intention to destroy the life of the constable, but merely to alarm or disable him, and he therefore asked them to acquit him upon the more serious count in the indictment, which wcarged intent to murder. The learned JUDGE having summed up, the jury found the prisoner GuQty of wounding the prosecutor with intent to do him grievous bodily harm. Mr. ROBINSON said he was in a condition to give the Court some information respecting the prisoner, if his Lordship considered it necessary. Mr. Baron WATSON said it was quite unnecessary to enter into such an inquiry. The case was one of the very worst he had ever heard, and he must deal with it as such. The prisoner was then brought up for judgment, and, the learned judge having remarked upon the very aggravated character of his offence, said he felt it to be his duty to pass upon him the extreme punishment fixed by the law for the crime of which he had been convicted, which was that he be transported beyond the seas for the term of his natural life. John Brett, 37, was charged with feloniously casting and throwing upon Thomas Robinson a quantity of vitriol, vith intent to burn him, or to do him grievous bodily harm. Mr. Payne prosecuted; Mr. Ribton defended the prisoner. It appeaed that the prosecutor and the prisoner lived Mar each other in Chsrch-row, St. Pancras, and that there had been a good deal of ill feeling between them. On the 17th of May there was a fight between the son of the prosecutor and two boys of the prisoner, and the prosecutor parted them. He was then, it appeared, about to go to his own house, and as he was passing the prisoner's shop he threw over him a quart pannikin of vitriol, at the same time exclaiming, " Tke that, you old -, that will warm you I" The prosecutor was most dreadfully injured by the vitriol, and when he was taken to the hospital his neck and face were completely charred, and he still appeared to be suffering most severely. The jury found the prisoner Guilty, and he was sentenced to be transported for 15 years. NEW COUIRT. (Before te RECORDER.) John Herbert Taylor, 30, chymist, James Sullivan, 22, engineer, Henry Scaines, 22, traveller, and WiLliam Saines, beershopkeeper, were indicted for burglary in the dwelling. house of Matthew Moran, and stealing property of thevalue of 80. They were likewise indicted for feloniously receiving the articles stolen. Mr. Sleigh and Mr. Lsxton prosecuted; Mr. Sharpe appeared for Sullivan and Tyl. r, Mr. Ribton for Renry Scaines, and Mr. Salter for William Scaines. The evidence adduced proved that upon the 224 of April the premises of the prosecutor, a draper in High-strett, Newington, vere broken into, and a quantity of shawls, handkerchiefs, and some articles of jewelry stolen. Upon the 5th of May the police received information upon which they acted, and went to the Alpha beershop, Alpha-place, Caledonian. road, kept by William Scaines. The police, upon going upstairs to a back room upon the second floor, found the prisoner Taylor dressing himself, and Sullivan in bed, and in the room were articles resembling the stolen property, part of which the prisoners Taylor and Sullivan had been wearing at the time. The prisoner William Scaines came up, and the officers told him that they suspected there was some stolen property in his house, and he said he knew Lothing about it. The police then searched a cupboard, the door of which William Scaines unlocked, and there found a bundle of rusty skeleton keys; upon a chair in the bedroom was a crowbar. Upon searohing the first floor a chain resembling one of those stolen was found in a drawer, attached to a wateh. On searching a cupboard behind a table in the bar the police foundsome more skeleton keys, and also some handkerchiefs and neckties resembling those which had been taken from the prosecutor's. The prisoner Henry Scaines then eame in, and upon him was found a necktio. part of the stolen property, and upon the officers searching the lodgings of Henry naines, in the same street, some other portions of the stolen property were found. Tlpon the aboes of Taylor being compared with some footprints in the garden at the rear of the prosecutor's they were found to correspond. The prisoner Henry ScaineS also made some remarks to the polce which led to the inference that he knew of the bur. glary, but the prisoner William Scaines all through denied having any knowledge of the affair, or that the property was in his house, and gave the police all the assistance and inforn,ation he could. Several witnesses gave the prisoner William Scaines a very high character. The jury returned a verdict of Not Guity against William Scaines, coriviming the other prisoners Two other indictments against William Scaines for receiving stolen goods were then withdrawn. Tayor was eentenced to six years' penal servitude, and the other two prisoners to 12 nmonths' imprisonment.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I observe inL Your ismue of yesterday, the 17th inst., a letter siged " Jbhn Frost," inL which a most wanton attack is made upon the character of the late Mr. Price, inapecWtogeneral of convicts in Victoria, stating ,that a' more unjust,merciless man,one less fitto havethe manage. ment of prisoners, could not be found in the penal colonies." I was in Victoria when the frightful murder of Wr. 1Price took place, and can state that a generAl feeling prevailed t'hat by his death the colony had lost an excellent officer, a just and able magistrate, and a man possessng the highest abilities for the appointment he had held for year with advantage to the Government and honour to himzelf. So fully are the Legislature impressed with the value of the late inspector's servies that I know it is their intention to vote a suma to his family in approbation of his long and honourable official career. I have no connexion with the late Mrt. Price or his family, bnLt feel that an attak upo1L his charater after his death should not remain a day unanswered. With John Frost I decline all controversy. I know no person of that name connectedl with the Auistralian colonies, unles a convict, who was some -yeans Bince in Vani DIemuens Land. I trust, Sir, you will kidndly insert this note in your ismue of to-mnorrow. A tUUW.NIST OF TWENTY YEARS' London, June I& STANDING..
COLLISION IN TH CHANNEL. -SOU.4M PTON, Thursday.-The Belgian Royal Mail Company's steamship Constitution, Captain E. Pougin, arrived here to-day, on her voyage from Antwerp for New York. The captain reports that he left Antwerp yesterday morning, and nothing occurred till 45 minutes past 12 this morning, when the vessel was between Beechy-head and Dungeness, with a fine breeze from N.N.E. and clear veatuer, steering west by compass, aU sails set, and her lights burning. At this time a vessel was observed on the starboard bow. well clear of the Constitution, steering east. When about three or four cables length distant, her head abreast of the starboard bow, the vessel suddenly altered her course, and approached the Constitution, the helm of which was immediately put hard a-starboard. Captain Pougin states that he did this contrary to the usual sailing regulations, for the reason that if he had pursued the usual course and ported his helm an immediate and serious collision must have occurred, as the strange vessel was so far on the Constitution's starboard bow. The steamer's engines were stopped immediately, and the other vessel continuing to fall off, the two came in collision, neither of the vessels sustaining much damage. The captain, second mate, and two of the men of the strange vessel (which proved to be the Genova, Captain Cubitt, from Palermo for London) leaped on board the Constitution; and they reported that the Genova had half-an hour previous been in collision with a brig and thereby received serious injury in his bows, the water-tight compartment forward being full of water. The lifeboat of the Constitution was lowered and sent back to the Genova with the captain and mate, the two men being subsequently found to havo concealed themselves on board the Constitution. The damage done to the Genova was found not to have been so serious as the captain had at first imagined, and the latter resuming the command of his ship, the two vessels proceeded on their respective courses, the Genovoa for London, and the Constitution for Southampton. We bave had the above statement from Captain Pougin, who. together with his officers, has had them embodiedinp legalprotest. The Constitutionsailsatdaylight for New York. KG 's COLLEGE HospITAI.-The committee for the completion of the buildings essential for carrying out the purposes of this institution have taken measures for holding a public meeting in the Great Hall of Linooln'sinn on Saturday (to-morrow), at 2 o'clock, at which the Duke of Cambndge is to preside. This hospital, which was founded in 1839, has been the means of conferring innumerable benefits on the vast population which surround it. During last year it received 1, in-patients, and administeren medical relief to 25,564 out-patients. The large additions to the building, which commenced in 1849, have been found insufficient to meet the increasing number and necessities of the poor seeking relief, and it has been determined to raise a fund for making various alterations of a comprehensive character. It appears tbat a sum of 40,0001. is required for the completion of the hospital and for the current expenses for the next two years, and of this sum the committee and thoir friends have already contributed 10,000!. The choir of Lincoln's-inn, assisted by some members of the Sacred Harmonic Society,wiUl take an important part in the meeting of to-morrow,and will perform *'The Qaeen shall rejoice." by Handel; "Beneaictus qui venit," by Mozart; and " La Carita." by Rossini. RoYAL BoTANIa SociETY.-The second exhibition this year of the Royal Botanic Society took place yesterday at the gardens in Regent's-park. Many prizes, as usual, were awarded to successful exhihitors, and the show was suffliciently beautiful to attract a large number of visitors, among whom were the Duchess of Camhridge and Princess Mary, the Ducheos of Marlborough, the Marchioness of Aylesbury, the Earl and Countess of Wilton, and Countesses Dysart and Chesterfield, Lords G. Lennox, R. Grosvenor, G. Beauclerk, Ladies Beuchamp, Dacre, Clinton, Grey, and Holland, and the Bishop of Winchester.

The Statute on Middle-Class Examinations was then sub-. mitted to the Hfouse in two clauses, on both of which there wero divisions. The main portion of the sttut wascarried by 73 votes against 17 - the clause assigning to successful candidates the title of Associate in Arts was also caried, but only bya aajority of 16, there being for it 52 votes, and against 36 Two decrees wero then submitted, on one of which a division took place. The object of the decree was to allow persons to go up for their fLnal examinations in next October erm nwithout vhing attended more than one course ofprofessors' lectures, the circumstance thought to render such a decree necessary being the non-delivery of any lectures by the Regius Professor of Modern History during the current term. The docree was carried by amaiority of 20, there being in favour of it 39, and gainst it 19 votes. The other decree was passed without a division. Tn a congregation held immediately afterwards a now statute on the subject of the Taylor Institution was promul. ated. The master of University, who was very imperxectly heard, objected to the omission of certain clauses in the old regulations. He moved two amendments, one to restore these clauses, the other to omit a restriction requiring that the Librarian should be appointed from among the teachers. Mr. Gordon, of Christ Church, objected to the want of any limitation with regard to age or standing in respect of the scholarships which i was proposed to establish. There was nothing to prevent theelection ofthe Professor of Modern Languages or the Vice-Chancellor. He also objected to the prizes being given in money, and would prefer a gift of books. Dr. Wellesley proposed to omit the words si ezranews fuers4 sec. 2, and a clause requiring the Professor to ubscribe to the 39 articles in sec. 3. Mr. Rawlinson, of Exeter, doubted the expediency of establishing scholarships, and thought a better use may be found for the money. If scholarships were established, he thought it would be better to give them for proficiency in one language than in two. He moved an amendment in this sense. Mr. Shirley, of Wadham, thought that if proficiency in two languages was required it ought to be allowed to take up French and German. Dr. Jeune explained that the statute would allow this. He thonght the clauses which Dr. Plumptre wished to retain were impled in the terms of the statute. He had inclined at first to take the view of Mr. Rawlinson with respect to the scholarships, but on the whole had thought it would tend to their being gained rather from the accident of birth or education in a foreign land than from honest and legitimate study. Mr, Tweed, of Exeter, proposedito omit a clause in sec. 63, forbid. ding the teachers to receive any fee from their pu iis He would propose instead that they should be allowed to take a terminal fee not exceedin two gtinea The English E ssay hwbeen awarded to Mr. H. S. Can. ningham,B.A., of Trinity College* and the English Poem (Newdigate) to Mfr. A. S. Worsisy, scholar of Corpas Christi College.
NATIONAL EDUCaTION SOCIETY.-The annual general meoting of this society was held yesterday at the Uentral School Rooms, Westminster. The Arohbishop ot Canterbury presided. There were present the Bishops of Salisbary, St. Asaph, and Bangor, the Hon. W. Cowper, MP., Mr. Henley, M.P., Archdeacon Sinclair, and many other friends of the society. His Grace, in openiug the business of the day, said, it was satisfactory to know that the education of the people was a subject which occupied a large space in the public mind; bat it was not, ho said, desirable that it should engage any extended space iu the attention of Parliament. It was better that the society should go on in the administration of its own schools as it had bitherto done. A great conference was to be held next week on the subject, and he rejoiced that a matter of such high concernment had at length arrested the attention of the ablest and the most exalted in the land. The Rev. J. G. Lonsdale then read the report, which briefly stated the operations of the society durng the past year. The Hon. W. Cowper moved a vote of thanks to the committee, and observed that the society not only greatly aided by its practical operations in the e-ducation of the worldng classes but stood as a witness to the principle which he was happy to think was now generally acknow. ledged, that the education of the poorer classes was a matter which it was the duty of the owners of the property on which they resided to provide for. It was acknowledged that one means for improving the conditionof the poor of this landwas by providing schoolsfor theirchildren. Therecordsofthe Privy Counciloffice phowed a degree of patient, self-denying, energetic zeal on the part of the clergyin this matter which was worthy of all admiration. It was not an unusual thing for a clergyman to make himself responsiblefor 10 timesthe amount of his annual incomeinordertocarryouttheworkinwhich hewas engaged. Blame had been attached to the system of training which young women in vilage schoolrreceived from tbe society. It was said that it had a tendency to excite their imaginations and to induce them to aspire to a position above their own spnere. There might be some truth in this, but he did not think the schools were blameable. It was rather an instance of the general improvement of society, where every one was seeldng to attain a higher position than they were originally placed in. This feeling of ambition was the natural result of the cultivation of the mind. The resolution referred to adeficienoy of the funds in consequence of the withdrwal of the Queen's letter. The Govermment having in other cases recognized the voluntary principle did not think it was in conformity with that principle that Her Majesty's name should be used in the way it had hitherto been in connexion with the Royal letters; they, there. fore, thought it was the duty of the friendi of the society to raise funds by other means Mr. Dickenson, in seconding the resolution, which wag unanimously adopted, said thatin hisopiniop the withdrawal of the Queen's letter was a rightecs thing, since experience had shown that the voluntaryprinciple was much more valuxble, and one much more to the relied upon than the principle of oobpulsion which was in a degree involved in the Queen's letters. The different officers of the society were then re-elected for the ensuing year, and the usual formal business having been transacted the meeting W brought to a close by prayer and the benediction.

The wind was northeasterly, and alloied the yachts to fetch into St. Clemenft before they made a board; there was then some smrkt work at beating, which was resumed in the Lower Hope, thet boats being pretty closely hauled the rest of the way downs At the Chapman tho Ph ntom was a mile or neaely soahead of her rival, having increased her l'ad on every tack. The Kitten was so far ahead ol the others in herclass s to leave them little or no chanoe of success.

FIRE r- G-AY's-ITx-L.A .-ILast night, about 1i o'clock, a fire took place on the premises of Mr. Thic'bpoon, cap and bonnet manufacturer, Gray's-inn-lane. The in. mates-seven or eight men, women, and children-it is suppoeed escaped in safety, but the premises and aUl they contained were destroyed. Some adjoining premies wee damaged. Two other fires also took place yesterday in thesame neighbourhood, at each of which a great amount of property was consumed. THE SocrTY EOR THE P1ORPAGATiOx oF TR% GOSPEL nf FOREIGN PAxITs.-The annual meeting of this society was held yesterday at the Mansion-house. Mr. Tite, M.P., presided in the earlier part of the day, but the chair was afterwards taken by the Lord Mayor. There ws a very Isege attendance, the body CC the meeting being chiefly filled by ladies. The Bishopof Chichester moved the following resolution:-"That the discontinuance of general collections, under authority of the Queen's letter, whereby the Society for the Pro. pagation of the Gospel has sustained a loss of 10,0004 a-year, seems to call upon the Church at lare fornew and increased efforts to sustain the missionarr operations of that society both in the colonies and heathea dependencies of Great Britain." The acquisition of colonies, observed the right rev. prelate, involved the responsibility of providing religious instruction for the peoplq who inhabited them, and there was not a portion of the globe in which the labours of the society znieht not beapplied with the most beneficial results. Mr. Hankeyseconded the resolution, and said that there was somaething incnmbent on the citizens of London to promote the obiecte. of such a society as the one they were then advocating, because it was the expansive commercial power of that citr which created the colonies in whose behalf the society wA* founded. Sir W. P. Wood, Vios Chance]lor, mnoved th6F secondresolution-viz., "That themany oenings and opporw tunities for the propagation of the GPe in India and theEast demand of us a large and immedciate increae in tbenumber of missionary labourers. The resolution. having Iseen enforced by the learned gentleman ZLn a very effective speech, it was seconded by the Bishop of Oxford in a strain of eloquence that elicited reiterated cheers from a most crowded meetin. The follow.-t ing resolution was then moved by the Rev. Dr. Hook, an seconded by Mr. Newman Hunkt,-" That the libera grants reocently made by the society for the fouxation of new iniuons in South Afica, BorDeo, Rm. ritins, Ceylon, and Vancouver's Islaed, entitle the society to the warm support of all rho are intereated ia the efforts of the oburch of Englaud for the oer. version of the heathen." The Bishop of Rule.rt's uaxt spoke in support of the resolution, which was nnanimouslr agreed to. A vote of thanks to the Lord Mayor was thU proposed and carried by aclamation, nad the mneeting "Pa% rated. Contrbutions were liberally given atthe doors of lwi lfansion-house.
