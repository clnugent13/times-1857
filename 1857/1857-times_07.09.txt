On the order of the day for the third reading of this General ACODRINGTON rose to oppose the Bill, because, among other reasons, its principle was contrary to an opinion which thelateAdmiral Codringtonexpressed in strong terms to the First Lord of the Admiralty, to the effect that the navigation of the river Thames and of all tidal rivers was Miable to be seriously damaged by embankments, wharfs, and piers thrown into them y irresponsible persons. An examination of the details of this Bill had convinced him that, although it was introduced as a private measure, it was, nevertheless, one of the greatest possible public importance. It proposed to emrower a body named Conservators of the River Thames to embank it, and project wharfs upon it, and to obtain rents for those wharfs, two-thirds of which were to be devoted ostensibly by them to the improvement of the navigation of the river. The remaining third was to be paid to the Govern. imeat, but for what purpose the Bill did not state. TheBill would effectuallypreclude that House from havingany control over the navigation of the river. It was said to be a compromise of a long-disputed claim to the bed and soil of the river, the contesting parties being the Crown on the one side, and the corporation of the city of London on the other. He was not aware of the opinion entertained by the .Board of Admiralty with respect to the Bill, bnt he had seen a report issued by the Board of Trade which con-. damned in very strong terms the proposed appointment of conservators of the river. (Hear, hear.) The Board of 'rade in that report referred to an opinion expressed by a committee which had sat upon the subject, to the leffect that the management of the navigation of the river 8hould not be intrusted to the city corporation, because its members had not the requisite technical knowledge. The Board of Trade then referred to the seneme proposed by that committee for the conservancy of the river, and added that thisf Bill failed on two important points to carry that scheme ito effect. if this Bill were passed the navigation of the river, in which the public ware so largely interested, would be entirely under the control of the city corporation. It would therefore repose a very important public trust in an irresponsible body. There were many other objectionable features in the Bill. With the exception of a clause which required the consent of the Admiraty to anything jwhich impeded the navigation of the river, nothing was said in the Bill as to the prineiple on which the embankments were to be managed, and it would&therefore he open to the city corporation to authorize thq construction of as many wharfs as they please upon the ersbalisnksnts. Having axpressed a hope that the subject vould be fully discussed, he moved tat te Bill he read a thiud time that day six months. MIr. A YRTO1 could not understand on what principle a measure which would deal with the whole of the commerce of the port of London had beeu introdtdced as a private Bill, and thereforo hoped that before the. disaisgion. proceeded further the right hon. gentleman in- the chas would say whether it had bean proporly introduced 4 a.:j " vte BiL. Sir W. JOLLIFFE wished to observe; before the hon. .gentleman's question was answered, that this, which pro. fessed to be a merely private Bill,, would interfere with the rights of no less than four or five counties. The SPEAKER.-The hon. moneibr having done me the favour of mentioning to me last -nght the doubt which he had oanthis point, I have given to t the best attention that I could. The Bill was introduced in the last, and has been revived in the present Parliament. The notices have been given in due form, and the standing orders have been proved to have been complied with. The conservators of the river are the promoters of the Bil, andy although it is perfectly true that great public interests are mvolved in it, there have been many other cases in which Bils dealing in a similar manner with public interests have been allowed to be introduced as private Bills. (Hear, hear.) I believe that, according to Parliamentary usage, this Bil, however lagelyit tnvolves the public interests, h s been prop erly brought into the House asea private Bill. (Ehear, hear.) MIr. Alderman CUBITT said that the origin of the Bill was-this-about 14 years ago a great deal of objceotion 'was mado to the unsightliness of the banks of the river Thames -between"Westminster and Greenwioh, and several schemes were suggested for beautifying both sides of the river. One of the Admiralty engineers and two other eminent en- ineers devoted a great deal of attention to the subject, and finally they agreed upon a plan, which was submitted to the 'corporation of the city ofc London. The corp~oration, who 'were interted in theYroperty of the bed andsil of the river, desired to have ti erecesses along each side of the riverdfiled up, and theyv proposed to empower the parties who ovwneclproperty near those recesses to fd ilthem up upon terms to be agreed upon. The Solicitor of the Woods and Forests-thought that that course would affect the rights of the Crown, and be instituted a suit against the corporation, in which thea Crown clainied the property of the bed and soll of the -river. That suit was prosecuted for several ywes, and at length a oompromise was entered into, which this Bill would carry into effect. All that the corporation desired was to discharge efficiently one of their Public duties. 'Ho bad been coninected with the city for several years, and 'he contd conscientiously say that the -corporation had notittetslightestp a or seldsh interest in the matter. (11par, hear.) Sir .DE L. EVANS thought that the candid declaration uof the worthy aldermarnwas entitled to considerable weight. He understood that one or two clauses with' reference to a noew tax on steamers pyiwng above bridge had been omitted. If-that were so, deal of his objection to the Bifl hn d been removed. 'Merver eithess,he maut regard the Bill as a species of -rather retrograde le~gislation. Every corporation -in the kingdom but thxat of the city of London had been reformed. Theo'moderate reform proposed by the -Government a year or two ago was still opposed by the city -corporation. 'iThe Hfouse ought to recoiletF tht thAt; corpor4tion was instituted at a -imae when the commerce -of London. was insignificant In compar'son with it-s presentgigantic proportions. IAverpool abeost 100 -years ago was little meore than a village, but its port was.zow.only second to that of London. in re?wet of commercial importance ; and as the corpoaino .,vr.u _suoDan eomd on th existi posateonof aver.pool had been reorm^aed to 3ne-et -the existing state of things, so ought that of London. The city of Londoa was in ancient titneg the capital of the lingdom, but now Lon,don proper tad a pgpulation of -IWG,000, while that of the mnetropolis was about 2,Mfl 0. That was a further reason for reformingthe corporation. He concurred with the hon. and gallant General in thinking that ane of the principal objections to this Bill was that it proposed to constitute a board thegreater part of whose members would not be qualified to deal with the matter intrusted to them. He entertained the highest respect for the members of the Common Council, but their prsuits and habits were wholly unconnected with navigation. And yet, if this Bill passed, they would always hs.ve the power of outvoting the Governmenst on questions affecting the navigation of the Thames (Hear.) In fact, they woald be less responsible than heretofore for the proper navigation of the river, because if any com ulaint were hweafter made on that subject they would no doubt excuse themselves by .saying that the Government was equally responsible with them. Under these circumstances, if the hon. and gallant General should insist on a division, he should be obliged to vote with him; but he recommended the hon. andgallant General to pursue a different course-namely, thatof endeavouring to altor the composition of the Conse7sTzncy Board. Mr. 1ENLEY a8sumed that the hon. and gallani General had not read the whole of the report on which he had based his opposition to the Bill, because he had spoken of it as if at were the report of a committee of that House, whereas General CODRINGTON.-I meant to say that it was the yaport of a commission. Mr. HENLEY.-The question had been investigated not ky a committee, but by commisioners, and that made a material differ',rice. Tho House would recollect that those commissione s were appointed to male a thorough inquiry vith respe'A to the corporation of London, in order to ascor. tain to ',hat extent that sort of reform which had been applie,A to other corporations might be applied to it. So far as be -was informed, the commissioners did not make any mnc'oiry as to the property of the c-rporation, and it was 'aportant to bear that in mind, beeause the report of the Board of Trade on this Bill, oddly enough, began by meroly saying that the object of the Bil was to put an end to a suit now, or lately, pending as to property claimed by the corporation. But the fact was that that suit had been at that very time ended by an actual agreemtent entered Into with the corporation, in pursuance of a Treasury minute, by which that suit, which had been going on for 12 or 13 years, was compromised. It would have been a more correct description to have said that the object of this Bil was to carry into effect that agreement. (Hear, heae.) But what he complained of was that in all the reasoning of thbat report, from beginning to ene, the Board of Trade wholly ignored that the city had a right to make, any claim in this matter, and dealt with the Bil as if the agreement were a white sheet of per. (Hear, hear.) And that was not all; for in page 3-of their report they dragged in another quotation froem the report of the commissioners, for the purpose of making it appear that the suit was stiU pending, so that any one who not read the two reports with care-and especially any one who spoke of the com. missicoers as if they were a committee of that Housemust suppose that the suit, instead of being settled, was sti going on. Forv what ceher purpose but that of mis. leading could an extract from a zepozt of the commissioners, bearing date 1854, have been put in so prominent a part of the report made by the Board of Trade with respect to this BiD? (Rear, hear.) Moreover, the Boardeof Trade dragged in coal duties, metage, and wine duties, and a great mary other things, which might be all very well if this were a Bill for the reform of the city corporation. It seemed to him that, as this Bill would settle agreatly litigated point between the Crown and the corporation, it world facilitate rather thaii impede a general arrangement with regard to those matters. (Hear hear.) The report of the Board of Trade was an attack upon the Treasuryr minute by which the compromise was agreed to. (A laugh.) Every line of that report was directed, not so mnuch against the BiU as against the Trea. sury minute, because the Bill, even with respect to that which had been so much objected to-namely, the constitution of the Board of Conservancy, did no more than carry out tothebletterthecompromisecontainedin theTreasuryminxte. The proposed board, composed, as it was, of nominees of the corporation and of the Crown, with two members designated by the Trinity House, did seem to him to be independently constituted. It was said that the Bill would affect private rights. Now, ample notice of it had been given, and if any private rights were invaded this ought to have been pointed out at the proper time,when the Bill was in committee. All he could say en this point was that he happened to be the owner of some waterside property on the Thames, and he did not feel himself aggrieved by this measure. (Hear.) It was rather unusual, after a Bill had gone through the ordeal of a committee, to start such objections as had been taken nowo upon the present stage, and he should, under all the circumstances, certainly support the third reading. (Hear, Mr. AYRTON said there was not a single passage in the agreement which in any way referred to the constitation of t e Conservancy Board, andhe did not therefore understand the remarks of the right hon. gentleman when he observed that this Bill was introduced in order to carry out the recital of that agreement. On the contrary, this Bill had no connexion with the agreement entered into bet*een the corporation and the Crown, which would hold good whether the Bil passed or not. The question before the House simply was whether they would assent to a measure which seriously affected the commercial interests of the city of London. Now, had the provisions of the BiU been considered bya select committee, say, of 15 membersrepresenting all interests, he should have been disposed to bow to the decision of such a body, but he thought that, under present circunastances, the House was quite free to withhold its assent to the third reading. Ee admitted the principle that the corporation should be adequately represented in the Conservancy Board, and that the Lord Mayor might properly be placed at its head, but there were far larger commercial interests atstake than those with whichthe city corporation was identified. For example, it was only right that the great docks of London, and those who were interested in the commerce of the port beyond the mere precincts of the city; should be represented in the board. That board, as constituted by the C-overnment, might be quite sufficient for the protection of general public interests, but was not calculated scialy to wateh over the interests of commerce, Under t ese circumstances, beingprecluded bythe formsof the House from moving that the Bill be referred to a larger committee than had yet considered it, he should certainly support the motion of his hon. and gallant friend, the effect of which would merely be to defer the consideration of this Bil untl the next session of Parliament. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER observed that two objections had been taken to the third reading of this Bill-one to the form of proceeding, and another to the contents of the measure itself It was said, in the first place, that this ought to have been a public, and not a private Bill. Now, with reference to this objection, hewoitld observe that, according to precedent, BiUs of Conservancy had been always treated as private measures; and that there was now a private Bill for the Couservancy of the Mersey, which had been refered to a select committee, over which his right hon, friend Sir J. Graham had with great ability preo sided. The House should remember that many securities existed in the case of private which did not exist in that of publ1i Bills. Looking to the vast number of most important Acts now under the consideration of the House, it was not very likely that if a Bill of 166 clauses relating to the conservancy of the Thames had been brought in as a public measure it would have been very carefuUy debated acroas the table of this House, whereas, being introduced as a private Bill, notices were required, it went before the ex. aminers, interested parties were served with notices, and had an opportunity of being heard by counsel before a select committee, witnesses could be examined, and reports of public documents were made for the information of the committee. It seemed to him, therefore, that there were more effectual securities for the due consideration of a Bill of this sort as a private than as a public measure. Ample oppor. tunity ha been afforded to the adversaries of the B ill if they had chosei to avail themselves of it, but they had not done so, and it was very inconvenient now to bring forward obh jections and ask the House to reject this Bil. This was not a usual course to take with regard to private Bills, and he trusted the House would not pursue it, except upon much strongergrounds than had yet been stated. Bt then it was said-" Why has the Government throvn overboard the report of tho Board of Trade V In repl to this he might ask why that report took such litte notice of the suit pending between the corporation and the Government, and the agreement come to between them. This Bill took its rise exclusively in the wish to settle a long pending suit between the city and tho Crown with regard to the bed and shores of the Thames. As to the conservancyitself, no dispute had existed. Itwas vested, as had been admitted on the part of the Crown, in the city of London; but the dispute was as to whether that conservancy involved the title to the beds-and shores of the river. Now, if this BiU were rejected the result would be that the whole power respecting the conservancy would revert to the city. The hon. gentleman who had last spoken said that all the House would do would be to postpone the Bill tiU next session. That was not the case; by adopting the amendment hon. members would not postpone, but would absolutely reject the measure, which if introduced next year must be proceeded with de7wvo. In his opinion, the settlement proposed with regard to the suit pending between the Crown and the city was a perfectly fair one. The only remaining question was that respecting the constitution of the Conservancy Board. It might be said that it would be better if the majority of the members were nominated by the Crown, instead of by the city. Something, however, was due to existing rights. At present, the whole power con. nected with the conservancy of the Thames was vested in the city. The cor oration, practically, had found the funds to carry it out, ana there was a large debt upon those funds, a great part of which they had already liquidated. Under these circumstances it seemed to him that the arrangement embodied in this Bil was a perfectlyfair one. Of the menmbers of the board he thoughtheniight say, pondevandi, non bnumera?d i mnt; though the nominees of the Government and the Trinity House would be in a nminority, yet, representing public opinion and possssing the power of appealing through the Government to this House, their influence at the board could not be reckoned bya mere arithmetical calculation. He would say, however, that this constitution of the Board of Conservancy was adopted with a view to the public interest and that of the port of London generally, and not with a view to mere sectional and city interests. He would repeat, therefore, what he had stated orn a former it wouldthnbcmte duty of PtherteSpr9esepn3tatives oif tee. GnoveirnDment to bfrin thhe hmatter under their consideration, revisste arrneetnd su bmit to this House A new vancy oufthe orivr baed. bnr soaetialrl pagstetehd consgero valley of the river bacl been practicaly neglected, ov ing to the disputes which had sprung up, and it was a matter of urgent public importance that thiis long litigated question should b brought to an issue. He hoped, therefore, that the House would not take the unusual course of rejeting this Bill upon its third reading. Sir 3. S. TRELAW was told that there existed a report which very materiay affedted the present question. The Bill embodied acompromJso betweenhe e Crown and the corporation, but third parties were concerned, whose ights had boen entirely lost sight of. He referred to the landed gentry throughout England, and to their interest in the foreshore which wvas materiallyaffected by this measure. le suggested that the Bill should be postponed until those interested were made aware of ita real effect. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER was ntot aware of the existence of the report to which the hon. baronet had alluded, but if he would refer to this BUl -he would see that the agreement between the Land Revenueofe and the city wvas set eut at length, and that it merely referred to this particLar suit. What the Attorney-General held was that the bed nd shores of the Thames were vested n tthhe Crown, while the city 4aimed item as conservators Sir J. GRAHAM was perfectly aware of the consequences of the voto he was about to give, and should record it against the third reading of this BiUl. (Year, hear.) He could very well understand that as between the Crown and the corporation as litigants the arrangement ulade by the ChanelUor of the Exchequer was a4vantagZSus to the former; but there were third parties of farjmore ims portanco than either-namely, tEe public and the amners of property on both sides of the river whosao intterests his right hon. friend had unguardedly overlooejed. Since the last discuesion the measure had certainly bean rendered less objectionable. At that time there was a claujs giving to this body of conservators a direct power of taxing all steamrs plying above bridge, between Putney and Ted- dU_gton. This power was now vithdrawn, and the Bill, therefore, to that extent had been imaproved. Still, however, very large taxing powers remained. There was the power of licensing landowners to make docks and wharfs; a power of taking tolls for and leasing new piers andlandingpl"ces; and also for making, altering, and removing piers and landing-places-aL most important powers, and 'Al yielding to this conservancy fund a large and, probably, an increasing revenue. it was not for him to defend the Board of Trade from the adverse comments of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but he did think that that board had faithfally discharged its dtuties in laying before the committee on this Bill the information they had afforded. The question now was really narrowed to this issue:-On the whole is the proposed Conservancy Board well constituted? On this point he should like to hear a distinet answer to the question whether it was part of the arrangement between the Government and the corpDration when they compounded the suit that this comaposition of the Conservancy Board should be a fixed principle. If this were a part of thebargain enttered into, he objected to it so strongly that- he should certainly incur the risk of voting against the third reading of thisBill. One of two things would happen upon the present rejection of the measure,-either' it would be brought forward next session; and this standing majority on the pert of the corporation in the Conservancy Board would not be proposed; or, if the measure were not then reintroduced, the whole matter would remain in abeyance until the general subject of the reform of the city corporation was undertaken on the repousibility of the Government; and whenever that time came he was confident the conservancy of the Thames would not be placed in such a body as was now suggested. There was, he thought, areat f3rce in the argament that a body so nominated was very objectionable. For himself, he preferred an elected body (hear), but if there was to be a nominated body he could conceive nothing more incongruous than a double system of adverse nomination by a close body like the. corpora. tion on the one side and partial nomination by the Executive Government on the other. (Hear, hear.) He was at a loss to conceive on what principle the Honse at this time of day should affirm that the best conservancy for the most important port of England, and for that river oa which they prided themselves, should be vested in the Lord .I ayor, two aldermen, and four common councilmen of the city of London. What was the peculiar aptitude of that body to administer affairs of such immense nagnitude? He spoke with all respect of the Lord Mayor and ol the ponderosity and weight which his presence at the board might be supposed to exercise. But the corporation were to have both weight and numbers too. He supposed. that in the composition of the board it would be considered, that like turtle soup, the more fat that was put into it the better ; while as regarded the tax-payers the principle would be adopted which was pursued in the manufacture of lime punch, in which squeezing was the great necessity. (A. flaugh.) Hefeared under this Bill that the tax-payers would be squeezed unmercifully and excessively. On the whole he believed that the Board of Conservancy would be an irresponsible body. It would be even less responsible than the corporation was at present, and being fully aware of the effect of the vote which he was about to give he should record it with great pleasure against the third reading of the Bill. (Hear, hear.) Sir J. DUKE had hoped that the alterations which had been made in the Bill since the second reading would have conciliated the support of those hon. members who had previously signifLed their intention of opposing it. He had been acquaiated with the river Thames for 40 years, and when he first knew it coasting vessels paid tonnage dues of 4d. and 2d. a-ton, but now the only tonnage dues imposed were on first, second, and third class vessels id. a-ton, and on the fourth and fifth class vessels id. a-ton. The Bill had been submitted clause by clause to the proper department of the Government, and every sUggestion which had been made by the authorities of that department had been adopted. He contended that there were among the members of the corporation eeveral gentlemen as well qualified to perform the duties of conservators of the river as any men who could be nominated, and, although practicaly the corporationwould have ainajority on theBoard of Conservancy, it wasnot likely that they would unite to carry out corporate objects to the detriment of the public interests. The corporation had set apart a large sum out of their revenues for the improvement of the metropolis, and he was zatisfied that they would be prepared, in their character of conservators, to lend a helping hand to the improvement of the river Thames, with which they had been long connected, and from which he admitted they had received great advantages. He trusted that the House would sanction the third reading of the Bill, and he was satisfied if they did so that the corporation of London would prove to the country and to Parliament that their only desire wao to promote the interests of the publc and to improve the navigation of the river. With respect to introducing the measure as a private Bill, he observed that the forms of the House had been complied with in that respect, and he reminded hon. members that only on the previoas day a precisely similar measure, affecting the navigstion of the river Clyde, had passed as a private Bill without a word of opposition being made to it. (Hear.) The HOUsEO then divided, when the numbers were,- For the third reading .. ..172 Against it-.. .. .. . 78 MEajority .. . -9 Tlhe Bill was then read a third time and passed. EXPENSES OF THE PERSIAN WAR The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHlEQUJER presented estimates to the amount of 500,000L. for the expenses of the war with Persia, and also of 500,0001. towards the military and naval operations in China, and moved that they be referred to the Committee of Supply. He also gave notice tat in the course of the present month he should move a resolution in Committee of Ways and Means with the viewv of founding upon it a Bill for continuing the present duties ipon tea and sugar as fixed by the Act of last session for two years from the 1st of April next. MKr. ROEBUCK could not allowv this opportunity to pvs without protesting against what appeared to him to hs a meet unconstitutional transaotion. A war had been declared, an expedition had been undertaken, a peace had been made, and the first intimaXtion which the Homeo of Commons received of the whole transaction was that a bill was to be paid. (Hear, hear.) Ho thought that the House would abdUcate its functions, and that it would not deserve to be called the Hoase of Commons of England if it did not mark with its reprobation such proceedings as he bad described. In the whole history of the House of Commons, from 1640 down th the present hour, such a thing had never happened. It had heen reserved for a Liberal Government, and for the ptresent Prime Minister of England, to threwv that slur and gmaupo th Hosoof Commnons, and if the House of I Comors sbmitedto t i wold howthat the noble buck) had. (lIear, hoar.)(JrRo Sir H. WILLOUHGEBY said that he had understood, in answer to a question which he had addressed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the Brant to be moved for the Persian war was 26u. 0001. He wished to know whether the 50,00l. now named in the estimates wes to be in addition to that 265,0001., or whether the smaller sum were included in the greater. He had understood, also, that the Indian Government were to bear half the expenses, and he wanted to know, therefore, wrhether 1,000,0-001. would cover the whole expenses of the Persian war ? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUTER said that it would be unusual and inconvenient for the House to enter into a premature discussion upon the estimates being laid upon the table. He had merely laid the estimates on the table at this time as a matter of convenience, and he would only state, in answer to the question of the hon. baronet that when he stated that the amount to he asked this session would be 260,000h., it was early in the session, before the termination of the war, before the signature of the treaty of peace, and upon the best data to which he then had access. T he sum which he nowr stated was inclusive of, and not additional to, that sum. It would be the entire demand to be made upon the H[ouse this session, and it would replacee the advances made by the India Board. hfr.F.SCOTT said that by the peculiar form of the exPres* 8ion used by the right hon. gentleman the Chancellor of the Eixchequer, limiting his observations to the present session, hewould seem to lnfer that there was a further sum to bede. manded in respect of this war upon a future oecasion, When the rnght hon. gentleman said that it was not usual to raise a discussion upon laying the estimates upon the table, ho (Mr. Scott) must observe that nothing could beinore unusual than the course which the right hon. gentleman himself had adopted with regard to this question. As the hon. and learned member for Sheffield had tuly said, the iirst intimation of the affair which had been given to the House was that there would be 260,000l. to be paid, and that intimation was given to them after the war had been concluded, without any inforination having been afforded to the country that such a thing had been undertaken. Wasn't that somewhat unusual? (H[ear.) The right hon. gentleman complained that anyone should call attention to the subject DcUSe he bad simply doubled the sum which he first stated that the country would be called upon to pay;* and then he had guarded his answer to the hon. baronet in such a manner as to imply that even double the sum was but an instalment, and that in another session the country would hs asicn rr soe uknow amuntfor hisunkiownwar assed for some unknovau amount for thi unknow war (Hear, hear.) He wished distinctly to be informed whether this 500,000l. was the whole charge which the country would be called upon to pay for the Persian war. Ee thought that the coursewhichhadbeenp rued with regard to the whole affair indicsted more forcibly than andthing that had before occurred, the servile condition of the House of Commons (Hear, hear.) The CHACELLOR of the EXCH3EQUJER said that he ddnot ask the House nowv to agree to any vote. He had merely p resented the estimate, and had moved that it be referrea to the committee of supply, which was the proner place for the consideration of the estimate. When the Government asked the committee to agree to a vote upon the subject, they would give a full statement of the case, which would involve, among other things, an inswer to the ques. tion of the hon. gentleman who had just sat down. Sir J. PAKINGTON rose to order. Wednesdays were, by the rules of the House, devoted to orders, and the right hon. gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer, no doubt not anticipating any discussion, had interfered with the regular orgers of the day by making a motion upon a most important subject, which was extremely likely to lead to a discussion, that motion, moreover, being made without the slightest notiee wbatever, without being placed on the business paper, and when no one had the least reason to sup. pose that the question of the expenses of the war with Persia would be likely to come on. (Hear, hear.) He begged to call the attention of the Speaker to the cir4cmstances under which this motion had been made, and he submitted that the proceeding had been in error ab initio. iSir J. Graham.-" Move that it be postponed."] Under all the circumstances Ike should move that the debate be adjourned. (Hear, hear.) Mr. LABOUCHERE said that his right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer had taken no course in this linatter wbich was not perfectly usual and regular. On pre- senting the estimates he had made a merely formal motion, which it was neither customary nor necessary to give any notice of. It wae a motion which never gave risc to any de-, bate, and the only +;nDg which had been unusual in the present case was t'Aat on a merely formal motion being made a debate had ari en. Sir J. GRAATAM and Mr. BUCuANAN rose together; but tbere bAring general calls for the former Mfr. Bachanan gavo way. The right hon. gentleman said that he rose to sneak to the point of order. The opinion of the Speaker lisd been asked upon it by the right hon. baronet the member for Droitwich, and he (Sir J. Graham) was about to suggest what he thought would have made this proceeding perfectly regular on a Wednesday. lie agreed that it was unusual on bringing up an estimate and moving that it be referred to the committee of supply that a debate should arise, and he suggested that if the estimate had been preseated at any period after a .quarter to 6 o'clock the proceeding would have been perfectly regalar. No debate, according to the roles of the House, could then have arisen. The motion would have been taken as a motion of course, and the irregularity into which they had now faUen woald have been avoided. But certainly it was open, he imagined, to any member to raise a debate on the motion to refer so large an estimate of expenditure to the committee of supply, presented under circumstances sO unuMsal as those on which comment had been made bv the hon. and learned member for Sheffield. He did not think therefore that the Government could be surprised if a debate should arise under sauch circumstances, and it appeared to him to be almost chaUenging discussion to pre. sent the estimate at a time when it was open to debate. 'Under the present circumstanees, he thought that the proper course would be to agree to the motion of the right hon. member for Droitwich, in order that the House might proceed with the orders of the day. ("Hear, hear," and cries of "1Chair.") Sir G. GREY said that his right hon. friend who had just sat down had implied that the course which had been taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was unosual. Now, he (Sir G. Grey) believed it to be the universal practice of every Chancelor of the Exchequer, before the House proceeded to the ordinary business of the day, to present the estimates which were intended to be considered afterwards in the committee of sapply. The time for doing that was not, he contended, a late hour of the evening,' or just before the Adjournment of the House ; bat the period selected was always before the House proceeded o the public business of the day. They had now been discasing for two hours a private Bill, which took precedence of all other business, and immediately that discassion ended his right hon. friend presented the estimates. He believed that the course which had been taken was perfectly in accordance with precedent, both with respect to presenting the estimates and moving that they be referred to the Committee of Supply, becauso tnless they were so referred the committee could take no co ,.7'&nca of them. [Sir. J. Graham.-"On a Wednesdayv?"` Yes'; on any day. During the 25 years that he had been in Parliament he never remembered a discussion taking place upor the presentation of an estimate, and upon the making of the necessary motion to give thel committee of supply cognizance of that estimate. (Hear, hear.) The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUEBR said that he had intended to present these estimates oi the. previous evening, and that he had brought them downr to the House for that purpose at the usaal time, intending to lay them on tne table before the business commenced. . Re mentioned his intention at the time to the Speaker, and went down to the bar, expecting that he should be called. The Speaker, however, did not see him, and therefore h}s name was not caUed, otherwise the estimates would have been presented then. He might add that he was not aware of any reason why the estimates should not be presented on a Wednesday as weU as on any other day. The SPEAKER said that the right hon. gentleman (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) intimated his intention to present these estimates yesterday, but not seeing him at the bar of the House before the commencement of public business yesterday he omitted to call the name of the right hon. gentleman. He believed it had been the universal practice, when a Minister appeared at the bar with an estimalte, that on his name being called by the Speaker he should be permitted to present the estimate to the House; and the motion that the estimate be referred to a committee of supply had been considered as a motion of course. (Hear, hear.) Therefore he himself should have considered that what was new, if not irregular, on the present occasion rather was that a motion so generally received as a motion of course should have been turned into a motion creating a debate. It was for the House to decide whether there was anything in this proceeding which interferred with the regular course of the business, but nothing struck him as being irregalar in the motion made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. (Hear, hear.) Mr. BUCHANAN proceeded, amid cries of " Order P' to call attention to the commercial inconvenience arising from constant alterations of the dates when certain duties on tea were to take effect. Sir F. BARING rose to order. The Speaker had already pronounced his opinion on one point of order, but a discussion on a notice of motion given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer with respect to the tea duties would be even more irregular than the conversation which had just taken place. (Heear, hear.) Sir G. GREY trauted that the motion for the adjournment of the debate would not now be pressed. Sir J. GRMEi& thought the motion for the adjournment might be withdrawn, after what had fallen from the Speaker and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The motion for the Adjournment of the debate was then withdrawn, and the proposed estimates were referred to a committee of supply. INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS BILL. The House having resolved into committee, the consideration of this Bill was resamed at clause 9. M-r. BOWYER proposed to add the following proviso to the clause :-" Provided, however, that the regulations of every such industrial school shall provide that a book shall be kept by the managers in which the religious denomination or church to'which every child admitted to such school, or theparents or the father of such child shalUbelong shaUlbe entered; and that every minister or clergyman officiating in any chapel or other place of worship duly licensed accordin to law in the parish within which such industrial schoo. shall be situated shall have free access to such book, and also to every child who shall appear by such book to belong to the religious denomination or church of which sich minister is a teacher." Mr. ADDERLEY objected to the proviso, as being calculated to render the whose system complicated and confused. The Bill had,'o proselytizing tendency, as under it parents might have their children sent to schools which they approved. Sir G. GREY pointed out that in connexion with another enactment of the Bill the proviso would defeat its own object; and Mr. BOWYER then consented to withdraw the proviso. The clause was agreed to, as were also claaues 10, 11, and 12. On clause 13, which provides that no child shall be detained in any certified induastrial school beyond the age of 15 years, Mr. BARROW proposed, as an amendment, to leave out the word 'fifteen," and to insert insteadthe word "twelve." He thought that if children were kept at the schools beyond the age of 12 years they would not be rendered active and muscular and fit to earn their livelihood in future life. It was important for the physical development of the children that they should be released from school at 12 years of age, when the education for labour ought to begin; and if these children were kept at school after that age it would be for the purpose of giVing them an intellectual and scientific education. Thus they would, by the aid of the State, obtain an unfair advantage over the honest children of industrious parents, Sir J. PIAINOTON trusted the committee would adhere to the clause as it stood, for it was most desirable that the power of detaining the children in the schools beyond the age of 12 years should exist. This power might not be always acted upon, but it ought to be whenever their detention was essential to their reformation. There were at least two Acts on the statute-book defining the age up to which childhood should be considered to extend, viz., the Poor Law Act and the Juvenile Offenders Act, and in both the period of 16 years was taken as the age to which childhood extended. Sir G. GREY thought that this amendment ought to have been proposed at an earlier stage. The second clause, which had been adopted, provided that the word " child" should include any boy or girl above the age of five and under the age of 14, and the amendment now proposed would be altogether inconsistent with that definition of the word "cchild.") Mr. LIDDELL supported the clause. Lord GODERICH had always feared that the effect of a measure of this nature would be to encourage idle and worthless parents to send their children inao the streets to commit acts of vagrancy, in order that they might obtain adminssion to industrial schools, bht he thought that manRyof the benefits which would result from the present Bi would counterbalance what he regarded as its defects. He would, however, voto for the amendment of the hon. member for South Nottinghamshire, because he could not doubt that in most districts of this country work could be found f or children 12 years of age. He considered therefore that children ought not to be forcibly detained in these iadustral schools?u to the age of 15 years. Sir W. HEATHCOTE said the adoption of the amendment would entirely chango the object of the Bill, by restricting its application to children below the age of 12 years. Lord EBRINGTON considered that some discretion should be left to the managers of industrial schools with regard to tho disposal of the children committed to their charge. He did not think it advisable that the inmates of such schools should be educated in trades or professions which would enable them to compete at an advantage with the children of honest and industrious labourers, who were unable to educate their children for the highly sldlled and better paid descriptions of labour. Mr. AKROYD expressed his intention to support the amendment. After a few words from Mr. K '1)DALL and Lor INaESTRmi, Mr. ADDERLEY said he thought it would be a nigs cruel proceeding to declare that at the age of 12 years the unfortunate children who were the inmates of these industrial schools should be driven from the only homes where they could seek refuge. He approved the provision of tho second clause, that childrin might be committed to these schools up to the age of 14 years; for, although they could not be compulsorily detained beyond the age of 15, those children who entered the schools at the age of 14 would receive a year's training, which it was to be hoped would prove advantageous to them in after life. Mr. BARROW explained that It was not his wish to compel the managers of industrial schools to expel children who arrived at the age of 12 years, but merely to provide that after that age children should not be detained in the schools against their consent. Mr. RIDLEY supported the amendment, which wasg opposed by Mr. SpooNmR. Mr. BOWYER thought the hon. gentleman who had brpught forward this measure deserved great credib for the zeal he had displayed in the cause of education, but he (Mr. Bowyer) coveplained that, while tho object of the Bill was to puni vgrancy, no distinction was drawn between habitual vagrancy and a slight offenoe which might be deemed an act of vagrancy. HIe woul7d vote for the amead. ment. Mr. E. BALL supported the amendment. Mr. BAGWELL said the managers of industral schools' were placed to a certain extent in loco parcntiz, and therefore considerable confidence should be reposed in them. He did not think they ought to be required to turn children out of the schools when they arrived at the age of 12 years, and he hoped, therefore, the committee would agree to the clause as it stood. | Mr. PAGET opposed the amendment, observing that, as the industril schools would be to a great extent dependent upon subscriptions, it was not probable that children would be detained in them for a longer time than was thought absolutely necessary. It was true that when children arrived at the age of 12 years a certain value attached to their labour; and he might observe that he had found em. loyment for several boys of that age among the farmers of bis district three days a-week, the alternate days being spent by them at school. This plan had been attended with very beneficial effects in the case of boys of somewhat indifferent character. Mr. ADAMS preferred the perlod of 15 years, provided by the clause, to the period of 12 years, proposea by the amendment. Considerable experience in the administration of criminal justice satisfied him that the most dangerous period in the lives of young persons was that between the ages of 12 and 15, when they were so near the adult period of life that they became the companions of older and frequently of ill-dispcosedpersons. lIethought, therefore, it was most nnadvisable to facilitate the discharge of children from these schools until they had attained 15 years of age. The committee then divided, when the numbers were- For the amendment ... ... 59 Against it .. ... ... ... 169 Majority against the amendment... -110 The clause as it stood was then agreed to. On clause 14, which provides that on the application of the managers of an industrial school, the parent of a child placed there may be summoned and ordered to pay a weekly sum not exceeding 3s. for the maintenance and education of the child until it attains the age of 15 years. Mr. BARROW proposed to substitute 12 for 15 years He wished by that amendment to remove one of the inducements to the managers of industrial schools to detain the children in those institutions beyond the age of 15. He couldsayof hisown knowledge that in the part of the country to which he belonged children below the age of 15 were often able to dontribute materially to the maintenance of the family; and he contended it would be hard in many cases to deprive a family of such assistance as a child of that age was capable of rendering. Under what circumstances was it proposed by this clause to compel the parent to contribute to the maintenance and education of a truant child in one of these schools? Had the parent been gUilty of any crime? (Hear, hear.) It was assumed, but most unfairly and erroneously, as he contended, that in all cases the parent of' a truant child was to blame. He hoped he shouldhave the concurrence of a majority of the committee in this endeavour on his art to limit the power oF compel. ling contributions from the parent to the age of 12 years, at which a child was unquestionably able to assist in maintaining himself and the rest of the family. htNEWDEGATE reminded the hon. member (Mr. Barrow) that by clauses 11 and 12 the magistrates, if satis. fled that suitable employment could be found for a child, had the power to order his discharge from an industrial school before the expiration of the time for which he had been sent there. Mr. KENDALL said he apprehended the moment this clause was passed into a law tlere would be a number of kindhearted persons who would seek to fix no small part of our social evils entirely on those runaway boys, who -would consequently be hunted from one end of England to the other, and in that crusade they would doubtless have the sympathy and assistance of the police. He submitted that if, ander this Bill, they chose to take a man's child into one of these industrial schools and to mulet his earnings-at a time, it might be, when he was already sufficiently pinched -to the extent of 3s. a-week for that child's maintenance and education, such a man would become soured, and should such compulsion become at all common it would give rise to a good deal of unpleasant feeling among the industrious classes. (Hear, hear.) Mlr. WALTER said he thought the amendment proposed by his hon. friend the memaber for South Nottinghamshire (Mr. Barrow) was a reasonable one, and, although he voted against his hon. friend on the Lst division, he sheuld sup. port him on the present occasion. After the education and trauning which a child would receive in any of these industrial schools he should be able to earn something by the time he was 12 yezrs of age; and he therefore submitted that it would ba un- reasonable to call on theparent of such a child to contribate. to his maintenance after he had attained that age. (Hear, hear.) The only difficulty likely to arise from the P?roposition of his hon. friend would be in case where a chQd was not committed to an industrial school until after he had attained the age of 12. Such instances, however, would probably not be numerous in comparison with the ordinary run of cases. The great majority of children sent to those institutions would, no doubt, be committed long before they bad attained that age, while some would go there at a very tender age; and therefore he did net think that any practical hardship would arise to the managers of those schools by exonerating a parent from contributing to the maintenance and education of his child after it had attained theageof 12years. (Hear,hear.) Mr. A. MILLS said he thought this was a vital clause in the Bill, and that the proposed modification of it was not desirable. It did not appear to him that there was any good ground for apprehending hardship to parents from the operation of the clause as it stood. He contended that the refusal of parents to contribute to the maintenance of their children in these schools, when they had the ability to pay, was a difficulty which the Leislature was bound to meet. There were instances within his own experience of parents in the receipt of 30s. a-week who scornfully refused to con. tribute a single sixpence towards keeping their children at schooL (QHear, hear.) He should therefore support the clause in its integrity. Mr. BRISCOE supported the amendment. He reminded the committee that a boy at the age of 15 might receive a commission in the army, and contended that a person ceased to be a child long before that age, and ought to be in a position, where there was a necessity for it, to earn something towards his own livelihood, and to assist his parents. Mr. MIES contended that there was no legal emancipation of a child until he had attained the age of 16 ; and he *sked why a child on emerging from an industrial school at, an earlier age was to be supposed perfectly able to assist in maintaining himself and the other members of his family7 It was wede known that in this metropolis parents earning 40s. and 60s. a-week had refused to contribute a single shilling to the maintenance of their families. It wahs persons of that class that he wanted the law to touch, and he shouid therefore support the clause as it stood. hir. MASSEY said this question had been substantially decided by the voto at which the committee had just arrived, and it would be manifestly inconsistent, after having deter mined that no child should be detained in anv industrial school beyond the age of 15, to say that the cability of his parent to contribute to his masi tenance in such school should cease after he had attained the age of 12. Why such liability cease at that age was to him (pr. Matsey perfectly inoomprehensible. The princple of legislation mi thi matter was that sufficient time should be alowedi to operate upon a child in an institution of this kind, and hose best acqueited with the subject urged that two years was the shortest possible peried necessary for that purpose. Mr. PEASE said he thought it a great hardship that the children in these industrial schools should be detained in them for a period of three years after they had attained an age when they might be expected to assist in the maintenance of themselves and the family remaining at home. He begged to remind the committee that cases migh happen in which not one only, but three or four members of a family might be placed in institutions of this kind; and, he asked, who then would be left to assist in supporting the rest of the family at home? (lgear, hear.) Se had niany and strong objections to this Bill, but he was opposed to this clause in particular, and would therefore support the amendment before the committee. The committee then divided, when the numbers were,- For the amendment ... ... ... 78 Against it ... ... ... ... ... 161 Majority against the amendment ... -83 Lord B. HOWARD took exception to words in the clause by which, over and above the 3s. a-week whieh a parent was to contribute to the maintenance of his child in an industrial school, he was to be charged with the payment of other "expenses incurred respecting the child, and also the expenses of conveying the child to school.,, He objected to that part of the clause, because the expenses mentioned in it were unlimited, and because the payment of them would press heavily upon the poorer classes. Mr. ADDERLEY assented to the omission of the words objected to by the noble lord, and the words were expunged accordingly. The clause, as amended, was then ordered to stand part of the Bil, as were also clauses 15, 16, and 17. On clause 18, imposing a penalty not exceeding 61. on persona who shall induce children to abscond or remain away from school, Mr. BRISCOE complained of the provision as being muecessarily severe. A single justice ought not to be empowered to inflict so heavy a penalty. Mr. ADA-US thought magistrates might fairly be vested with a discretion on such a point. Mr. BARROW condemned the wording of the clause as singularly vague and loose, and as worse than the wildest of judge-made law. Mr. ADDERLEY said it had been drawn up by Mr. Sidney Tnrner, a very high authority on such questions. Mr. BOWYER said that three hours had already been Occupied in committee on this Bill, and it was now time to adjourn the discuzssion. There were various other orders on the paper, the second of which was the Tenant Right Bill; and as many hon. members were anxious to hear the statements which they espected would be made on that measure, he begged to move that the Chairman now report progress. Mr. ADDERLEY appealed to the House against this motion as being an indirect attempt to defeat a measure of which the hon. and learned gentleman had not the courage openly to move the rejection. (Hear, hear.) Mr. GREGORY hoped that the hon. and learned gen tleman would not press his motion. Lord E. HOWARD joined in the same request, and expressed his acknowledgments to the hon. member for Staffordshire for his courtesy in receiving suggestions that would improve his BilL The motion for reporting progress was then withdrawn. Mr. COX wished to reduce the penalty from 61. to 40s.; but The CEAIR IAN ruled that the time for moving su1h Ml amendment was past. In reply to a question from Lord GoDfznics, Mr. ADDERLEY said he was willing to insert the words "twfo stices, instead of "one jostice," on the bringing. up of the report.pir ofth Bil, On the question that the clause rtand part of the Bill,. tr. COX. as it was not competent for him to xubstitut4 a penalty of 40s. for ono of X, moved that the clause be The amendment was negatlved without a division, andthe. Ir. ADDERLEY expla{n.ing. that tho hon. member for nsory had not insisted on dividing because he had made him apromise to insert the words " bforty shillings" on the The remaining clauses having been agreed to, M1r. ADDERLEY, in lien of clause S, which had b3ensi postponed, aoved a clause providing that children taken.. into custody for vagrancy might be sent to school while inquiries were made. Mr. PALK admitted that this clause obviated the objections tsv which the original clause was liable. He hopedthis provision would lead to an examination into the condition of the union schools, with a view to their eitherbeing wholly superseded by industrial schoels, or made subservient to the purposes of this Bll. The clause was agreed to. Mr. ADDERLEY then moved a clause-for which he was indebted to the hon. member for Somersetihire (Sr. Miles)-in lieu of clause 7. Its object was to enable j3sticesto make the parent responsible for the good behaviour of his. child. The original coause provided for a legalsecurity being taken from the parent, but that having been stronglyobjected to by the right hon. member for Oxfordshire andu others, he now proposed that they should onlv require a. written assurance from the parent that he would be answrerable for the good behaviour of his child for any period cot exceeding 12 months. Mfr. BARROW thought that primd facie evidence oE vagrancy might be sufficient in the first instance to justify the remand of a child; but before he was committed tocustody for a long period a formal conviction woutd b3r indispensable. Mr. ADDERLEY deemed it ono of the principal mierits. of the clause that it avoided the necessity for a conviction. and only required that " satisfactory proof of the charge" should be given to the justices. At the suggestion of the Home Secretary he had adopted the words of an analogouss provision in the Summary Jurisdiction Act. Mr. BOWYER objected on constitutional grounds to tbeo wording of the clause. They ought not to call upon a parebti to enter into any species of recognisance for the good conduct of his child until it had been legally convicted of some offence. 'Unless they insisted on sueha formality they would. have no safeguard against an arbitrary exercise of power by magistrates. The hon. and learned gentleman then moved the insertion of words limiting the operation of ths clause to cases in which there had been a previous convic- Mr. BARROW objected to the infliction of a sentence oF confineinent upon the child, together with a liability for ito maintenance on the part of the parent until a formal adjudication, capable of being appealed against, had talen, place. Mr. MASSEY concurred with the hon. and learne& member (Mr. Bowyer) that a conviction was a necessarypreliminary to calling on the parent to give an assurancefor the good behaviour of his child. Without an adjudication by the magistrates at this stage of the case the wrholer proceedings would be irregular and anomalous. Mr. PALK reminded the committee that the Bill wasnot a penal one, but was intended to provide for the educa.- tion and care of destitute and vagrant children. The, amendment of the hon. member for Dundalk would alter the whole scope and tenour of the measure. lr. COBBETT. while respecting the benevolent object, of its author, could not help viewing the Bill as a Tery imprudent one. It was open to very grave objections, which. only grew upon them as they proceeded with Its discussion. He therefore begged to give the hon. member for Staffordshire full notice that on the order for the third reading ha meant to move the rejection of the measure. (Hear, hear.). He would suggest that the Bill, after passing through com. mittee, should be reprinted, and an opportunity given for full consideration. Mr. STAPLETON objected toprovisionsinflitiungpun-ih'* ment without a prior conviction. Mr. MASSEY said, no new offenco was created by-the BilL Before the parents could be called upon by the magistratetto become surety the child must have been convicted ofsome offence. Mr. ADDERLEY honed that at that late hour hon. members would confine their observations to the clauses underdiscussion, and not seek to defeat the Bill by a protracted dlicussion upon its principle. After a few words from Mr. Cox the amendment was agreed to. Mr. COX then proposed, after the words segiving mau1 trates power to order a chld to be detained for sachprl.i as he may think necessary for his education," to add, - not exceeding six months," Mr. MASSEY said, the hon. member appeared to mlsunderstand the object of the Bill, which was simply to sub4 stitute detention in an industrial establishment for deten.4 tion in a gaol. The amendment, if carried, would frustrate the intentions of the BilL. The House was cleared, but no division took place, th1. amendment being negatived. The clause, as amended, was then agreed to. Mr. ADDERLEY proposed the following new clauses. which was agreed to - "If the child, after such assurance as aforesaid being. given, be brought up again on a similar charge within the, period for which the parent has become responsible for his- goodbehaviour, the justices may in'dict a fine upon the-' parent not exceeding 40s., should it be proved to the satisaction of the justices that the last-mentioned act of va.- grancy has taken place through the neglect of the parent." Lord GODERICH proposed the following clause, wbiciz was also a.greed to:- "The time during which any child shall be lodged in any cerified industrial school under this Act shall, for all thepurposes of the Act of the 9th and 10th ears of the reign of Her present Majesty, chap. 66, and of every Act inoorporated therewith, be excluded in the computation of the time therein mentioned." 3r. GREGORY then proposed to add a clause, providing; tbat the children in industrial establshments should be p.er mitted to bave the teaching of the ministers of the religious body of which they or their parents were members. Mr. RIDLEYcomplained that he had been unable to heatthe clause read. From what he gathered of Its import he considered it to be highly objectionable and should there. fore oppose it. Mr. HENLE Yobserved thatmany of the childrento tD;omsthis Bill would apply had no religion at all, and was is intended that they s ould have no religious teaching? Mr. MASSEY thought that if a child stated he belonget to no particular religion he wonld be put down as a memjoer of the established church. (Laughter.) He thought ther. clause was one which required more consideration than time would allow upon this occasion, and would sugest X h . it should be withdrawn for the present and be brought U on the report. Mr. GREGORY expressed his willingaess to accede to that recommendation. Mr. COX objected, and moved that the Chairman doreport progress, but sabsequently withdrew his motion. Tho schedules were agreed to, and the Bill finally pass3l through committee at a quarter to 6 o'clook, the last moment; at which opposed Bills can be proceeded with on Wednes- OXFORD ELECTION. Mr. E. C. EGERTON reporte4 from the Select Commi tee appointed to inquire into the merits of the petition aagawust the return for the last election for the city of Oxford- "L That Charles Neate, Esq., was not duly elected t-> serve in the present Parliament at the last election for thecity of Oxford, and that the said last election, as far as. regards the said Charles Neate, Esq., wasa void election.

That it was proved before the committee that 19S persons were employed by Mr. Neate's committee as polclerks and messengers, 152 of whom voted for Mr. We ,te, and that they subsequently received from his agents payments of sums varying from 11. to 2s, 6d., which sums were paid under pretence of remuneration to messongeread runners; and, although it was not proved before the committee that these payments to the voters were the primary motives for deciding their votes, yet it appeared to.- the committee that in many cases no adequate services wera. performed for those payvments.

HAMISLTON reported from the committe>_ appointed to inquire into the petition against the last Maid. stone election, that they found Mr. A. B. Hope and Captain, Scott were duly eleted. The committee also reported that;the evidence given before them was unsatisfactory and con-- tradictory, and although no sufficient proof had been given of corrupt practices at the last- election, the committeethought it necessary to state that a sum of 3,500. was paidi in 1847 for the expenses of one candidate, although there, was no contest upon that occasion.

THE MUTINY AT MEERUT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIAlES. Sir,-In letters which have appeared in your journal of -the 29th ult. with reference to the mutiny at Meerut there are sundry comments on the handling of the Cavalry in that unfortunate outbreak, and I feel, from the tone of justice which pervades yonr columns, and from their general accuracy in all matters of detail, that you will do me the favour to insert this letter in reply to those statements; inasmuch as I am the nearest male relative of the officer who it is to be presumediwas in command of the Carabineers on the 10th of May, and more particularly as I am enabled to give, as far as is yet known, a most satisfactory explanation of the cavalry movements on thatday. The criticisms alluded to I shall succinctly divide into fhree heads:-1st, Delay in turning out * 2d, Vacilation of purpose; 3d, Incompleteness of the final attack. I bave, as yet, received no letter from the Cavalry quarters, but I have been favoured with the perusal of a letter from a most intelligent officer of the GOth Rifles, which describes the proceedings of the troops in general. I was about half-past 0 o'clock p.m., when tho 60th lItfles first heard the firing in the native camps, which were about three miles distant. On the arrival thence of a messenger with authentic intelligence, that regiment, which was preparing for church parade, fell in, and as soon as extra amnmunition could be distributed it was at once marched off, making a detour, in order to get rounid to the rear of the native cantonments. They were joined by the Artillery and Carabineers. So much for the alleged delay in turning cut. It was now pitch dark, and skirmishers of the 60th were thrown out, as the letter goes on to describe' in oreer to find out the position of the enemy. The Cavalry were doubtless sent to feel for them in another direction, for aumid all the tumult of that night it was uncertain in what part of the cantonments of the three native regiments the main body of the mutineers had chosen to assemble. However, the 60th Rifles came upon them; the Cavalry were doubtless recalled, which explains the counter m,arch of the Carabineers as detailed by a correspondent, and then themutineers were dispersed by two volleys of musltetry and some grape, and were then pursued for several miles out of Meerot by the Cavalry, who cut down a considerable number. So much for vacillation. In my humble opinion it appears to have been a well concerted attack. The 60th Rifles then returned to their camp, but only just in time to prevent its being burnt by other insurgents, -who came so close during the night that they had to be dis(edged from a neighbouring thieket. The writer proceeds to say that he has been on duty every night since the 10th of Way, and that he has only once had his boots off from that date up to the 17h of May. So much for the security of the camp at Meerut in the xcidst of an insurgent population. I now come to the allegation of incompleteness in the attack of the Carabineers, who are however stated to have followed for several miles (which is,in fact, al that Cavalry 'nsupported could bo expected or ought to do), and that advance was doubtless continued, as long as there was any tangible and collected body of the enemy in their front, a,though the mutineers could, of course, regain the high coad to Delhi by issuing from the enclosures and broken ground to which they had naturally fled, as soon as the 'plrsuit was (and under such circumstances most judiciously) diocontinued, although the moon had then arisen. However, an easy chair and a comfortable room give very vague and dissolvmg views on military questions; but it must be remembered that an impromptu and disconneoted advance of Cavalry on the road to Delhi beyond a certain distance (if unsupported by another arm of the service detailed for that duty), coupled -with the fact of leaving a camp and stores in considerable danger by such a movement, might justly incur bhe censure of high military authority, although it has been zecommended by certain zealous civilians. It is to be observed that the principal correspondent of the Indian newspapers is evidently a'-medical officer, who oet eight of the Carahineers in their final advance, and then attached himself to the Hforse Artillery, which did not go in' pursuit of the mutineers; and that he therefore could i now very little of the completeness of their dispersion. I have the honour to ha sir-. w.^r nn. 1 nn., INIGO W. JONES[ Ina Tis^>&o"i Ludford-house, Ludlow, July L
DEATH By FAa.? oG nOBIr A CILuR.-The coroner 'or Bath, Mr. A. HI English, held an inquest at the Guild. hall in that oity on Monday evening on the body of Mrs. Jane Prangley, a lady 50 years of age, who met with her death on the previous evening by fal3ing backwards from her chair. It appeared that the deceased had been for 2nany years housekeeper to Mr. Bennett, teaidealer of the Xigh-street, and on Sunday night she retired to her bed. .cbAmber as sual. The next morning, however, she did not >snake her appearanoe, and upon her room being entered she was found lyng dead upon the floor in her night-dress. Eer -eet wero restiDg upon a ohair and her head, which was * ressed forward upon her chest, was upon the ground, her ody forming a kind of arch. She had evidently, while ,aitting sideways upon kho chair, fallen backwards and broken .Zber neck. When found she was quite stiff, and had been, no6 doubt, dead for some hours, as her bed had not been -entered. The jury, after viewing the body, said that bet for the position in which it was found they could not have %elleved it po,ible that a person could have met death by ,=ch an accident. The sargical evidence showed that the -deceased had dldocated her neck by the fall, and the jury ,returned a verdict accordingly. The deceased was a very 4Qi hAl woman.
ELECTION COMMITTnPS. MAYO (COUNTY.) The following witnesses were yesterday examined on the part of the sitttig member:- mr. Willbraham, a magistrate and freeholder of county Mayo, said he h d voted for Palmer and Moore at the lait election, and corroborated the evidence of the witnesses who were called on Monday and Tuesday with regard to the tran- I qusllity of tbat election as compared with that of 1852 and with previous elegtions. He was one of the gentlemen who had made an unsuccessful application to the High Sheriff for a deputation. He also wrote to the Chief Secretary on the subject of an escort for the voters at Louisberg, and received an answer. (These letters were not allowed to be read. ) No troops were sent. The voters who were going to poll for Moore and Palmer were escorted to the poll at Vestport by non-voters. Moore and Palmer's voters were hooted and Mr. Higgins's voters were cheered. On cross-examinition the witness said that he held land at Louisberg under the Marquis of Sligo. The priest at Louisberg was a supporter of Moore and Palmer. Louifberg was in the barony of Mnrrisk, in which Colonel Higgins polled only 17 votes. He attributed the violonce which occurred in 1852 to the influence of the priests. He believed that two of the four priests at Westport took no part in the election. Mr. Jeffrey Mlartyn, a justice of the peace for the county of Mayo, residing three miles from Ballinrobe, and chairnman of the board of guardians there, said he attended the chapel there at which Father Conway officiated. On the dayle. fore the election he attended mass, and after the service I FatherConwayspoke tothepeople. He readthearchbishop's pastoral, and said in substance that he hoped the people would attend to the recommendations of their bishops * that the nilitary and police were under the charge of magistrates hostile to the caxuse of the people ; that he was afraid, if there was anythiug hke riot, they would be *oo glad to have the opportunity of shooting at the people, and he should tberefore anvise them to keep quiet. Father Conway did not say that Colonel Hig'ins was a most consummate scoundrel; that he had sold his country, his body, and his soul, and that the curse of God would follow every one who supported him. He believed he mentioned the name of HIiggins, and he might have said that Higgins had the presumption to ask their support, but he was unworthy of it. Be believed that FatherConwaysaidhehoped the curse of God would not fall on those Roman Catholic landlords who had kept their tenants from attending mass. He did not believe that the expression had reference to the votes to be given at the election. The witness further denied that Vather Conway had nsed the other expressions attributed to him by the witness French. On one occasion something had been said about himself from the altar, and he therefore paid particular attention to what was said by Father Conway. He remained in the chapel until the service was concluded and the people went away. On the afternaoon of that day (Sunday) be was at Gildea's Hlotel. Father Conway addressed the people from the room much to the same effect as his speech in the chapel. He said it was likely that Higgins's party bad employed people for the purpose of kicking up a row, and they Iad better keep quiet. With reference to the affair in the lane, of which witness only sawv the conclnsion, he said he saw Conway talking in a heated manner to the officer, to the stipendiary magistrate, and to young Mr. Burke. He saw no one in the lane but the freeholders, the police, and the military. He stood at a window looking down into the lane. There was no riot in the town, either on the Sunday or the Monday, although there was a crowd on the latter day, as it was market-day. The crowd shouted and hooted, but no act of violence was committed. He had some influence over the people, which he used to keep them quiet. Elevoted for Mloore and Palmer. On the Tuesday he was in various parts of the county, which he found perfectly quiet. He saw dragoons clearing the streets on his return to Balinrobe. Air. Conway was addressing the people from a window, but when he had spoken for a few minutes Mr. Kenny ordered the dragoons to clear the streets, and the people were dispersed. The people had not been behaving in a riotous mianner. He saw some of Colonel HigRins's supporters walking about the streets. At the time of the adjournment of the poll the town appeared to him to be perfectly quiet. He saw Mr.?SrhaTkie and the escort pass under the window from which hlr. Mloore was speaking. Mr. Sharkie clapped the poll-book with his hand as he passed. Mr. Moore asked what was his meaning, did he mean that he would falsify the books? and added that he believed him capable of it. No stones were thrown at Mr. Sharkle as he drove away. He had never seen a quieter contested election. Cross-examined by Mr. E. JAxxEs.-He nominated Mr, Aloore. Conway told him to state to the electors that the Archbishop had intended to nominate Mr. Moore, but he could not do it, as he had no vote. He accordingly made that statement. He saw the Archbishop in his carriage on the day of the nomination. He saw Conway in the lobby yesterday. The pastoral was read and the address made from the altar after the mass and before the reading of. the Gospel. There were about 500 people present. The witness was severely cross-examined with regard to what was said by Father Conway in the chapel, but persisted in his statement that he had not used all the expressions attributed to him by Mr. French. MIr. E. JAMES asked the witness whether his recolleotion was sufficiently accurate to contradict the statement upon oath of a gentleman who had made a memorandum at the time of the words used. Mr. KARSLAKE said his learned friend was endeavouring to intimidate the witneas. Mr. E. JAmis.-Are you intimidated? Witness.-No. (Laughter.) He could contradict the statement of Mr. French Conway told the people at- the chapel that he was going to hold a meeting. The witness then denied that Conway had usbd In his hearing, in the course of the speech from the window, after the service, the - expresasions attributed to him to- the effect that-he- wanted* ren to meet Colonel Higgins's voters. He believed that Conway had his hat on in the lane, and he appeared to bo remonstrating with the officer. Peace was soon restored. The Yoters whom he had seen going quietly about the streets were persons who gave one vote to Mr. Moore. He could not give the name of any one who plumped for Colonel Higgins who went to the poal without an escort. Mr. Mloore commenced his speech after the close of the poll on Wednesdaybysaying, "Boys, where'syourpriest?' Father Conway appesred on horseback in the course of Mr. Moore's speech, it was, unfortunately, too usual for priests to allude t private and other matters from the altar. He had complained to Archbishop M'Hale of a denunciation directed against himself. What was the result ?-Oh, it all ended in smoke. He had heard Conway refer from the altar to Colonel Higgins previous to the election. Colonel Higgins's petition had been read from the altar. Conway or another priest had called on the people to subsoribe to defend Mr. Sloore's return. Witness had paid his subscription at the chapel door. He heard Conway thank the people for presenting him with a sum of money. He thought that money had reference to the election, but he had not heard Conway say that it was to enable him to come to England to conduct the deF-nco of Mr. Moore's return. Re-examined.-It was too much the practice to discuss other than religious matters from the altar. At contested elections an escort was always necessary for the voters of the unpopular candidate. Colonel Wardell, of the Ist Royals, said he was sent from Dublin to Castlebar at the last election for Mayo. He had six tioops in the county, two of which were at Castlebar. He was at Castlebar during the nomination and the polling. It was perfectly quiet. There was a certain excitement, but no real disturbance. On the second day of the polling he received intelligence from the high sheriff that the polling had been suspended at Ballinrobe. There were two compa. ponies of infantry and one of cavalry there, and he then, on the 7th, sent over another troop, and also one on the 8th. He went to Ballinrobe on the morning of the 8th (Wednesday), and the town was then perfectly auiet. He saw Mr. Sbarkie pass the window where Mr. Moore was addressing the electors, but did not observe him say or do anything. He saw no stone thrown at him. Tho street was narrow. Thero niight have been a little hooting as he passed-nothing more. He thought that Castlebar on the Monday and Tuesday, and Ballinrobe on the Wednesday, were very quiet. On cross-examination the witness said that the high sheriff appeared to him to endeavour to preserve the peace of the county. By the CHAssRmuAN.-He received no complaints during the clection of injuries done to his men. One helmet was broken by a stone. Lieutenant Greyburne, of the 1st Royals, said that on the Sunday before the election some voters were collected at Claremorris, and they started, with an escort under his command, for Ballinrobe. Mr. Rutledge was the deputed magistrate in attendance. There were about 30 voters on horFeback and seven or eight cars. Some cheering took place when they were collected, and he advised them not to niake a row, upon which they gave another cheer. A crowd collected, and as they were leaving the town stones were thrown, and one man was hurt. There were about l10 voters altogether. Before they got to Ballinrobe they halted for a reinforcement, and they were broutght into the town by a by-lane near Monaghan's Hotel. He placed five men at the end of the lane, who kept the crowd back. As they got to the back yard of Monaghan's holel some stones were thrown from a walL Ie saw a priest on horseback. Thepriest complained that a pistol had beon pointed at him, andhe saw Mr. Arabin, the stipendiary magistrate, take away the pistol from a person. He heard Conwa;saytothe people, "Come away, boys; God bless youl aon't hurt the soldiers or_the police." The Monday was a market-day, and there were a good many peopi about, but he saw no violence. On the TuesdaV the crowd was very noisy. but he observed no violence. The town was quiet on the Wednesday. Lieutenant Greyburno corroborated the account of the previous witness with.rogard to Ir. Sharkie's passing by Mr. Moore while that gentleman was addressing the people. Cross-oxamined by Mr. E. JAsrs.-There were 200 or 300 people in the main street when they entered the lane. All the voteis he escorted were, he believed, the voters of Colonel Higgins. Many of them were escorted to their homes. Nicholas Welsh, a voter, also described tho scene in the lane, stating that Father Conway when on the wall told the people to be quiet and keep the peace. He did not hear him curse any one either in English or Irish. Witness voted for Moore and Palmer. He described the town as being very full, but said the election passed off quietly as compared with other contested elections. On cross-examination the witness said he had collected I money for the Moore fund at the door of the chapel in Balliurobe.Hehadsubscribedll.to,hefund. OntheSunday. before the eleetion he heard Conway read the pastoral and address the people. He made some severe remarks uison Biggins. He did not say the curse of God would. follow every one who supported him. He believed he said something about the curse of God coming upon those who kept voters from going to mass. He spoke for about 20 minutes. He should think there were about 1,O00 persons at m When he heard that Higgins's voters were coming into the town he might have been anxious to go with oither eople to meet them-to see them. HIe knew they wvr volonelHiggis'a voters as soon as he saw the militaryindeed, that was a sign, (Laug2hter.) Dnuffy was on the lwalb3mear Conway. He went thass to &r hatloek a the voters. Witness did nott hear Conway addresa the peoplein Jrisih. James Fleming' who had been present at Conway's chapel on the Sunday b, nre the election, said he had heard Conway's address to th.? people, and did not hear him make nse of the words attribute,l to him by Mr. French. He aLso corroborated the previous wit.ness with respect to the other occurrences at Ballinrobe during the election of which they had spoken. P. Fergus, a shopkeeper at Ballinrobe, denied that he had promised his vote to Mr. Griffin. He at first intended to vote for Higgins, but before the election Conway. who was a personal friend of his, canvaseed him for Moore and Palmer, and he voted for them. He voted out of personal respect for Conway, not in coaisequenee of intimidation. He told Mr. Griffin that he had been obliged to alter his minid. He ought to have used the word " induced," instead of 'obliged.' On cross-examination the witness said he had made a statement that Conway had come to his house with a mob of people and induced him to change his mind. That statement was correct. He voted as Conway wished him, for he thought it would be urngratoful to refuse. When Conway went out he told the people that witness intended to vote for Moore and Palmer, and the people cheered and went away. Re-examined.-Thero were a great many people about the streets. lie did not vote in consequence of any intimidation. The Committee adjourned until this day. OXFORD (CITY). The Committee met yesterday atlo'clock, and deliberated for about an hour and a half with closed doors. The CEAJIMNIAN then announced that the Committee had agreed to the following resolutions "1I. That Charles Neate, Req., was not duly elected to serre in the preent Parliament at the lbt election for the city of Oxford, and that the said lat electin, as far as regarda the Wid Charles Neate, Eq., was a void election. "2. That the aid Charles Neate, Ers., by his agents, committed bribery at the said election. $$3. That it was proved before the committee that 19.persouns were employed by Mr. NeaWs committee as poll-clerks and messengers, 152 of whom voted for 3Mr. Neate, and that they subeequently received from bis agtnts payments of sums varying from £l to 28. 6d., which sums were paid under pretence of remuneration to meaengers and runners: and, although it was not proved before the committ5e that theco payments to the voters were the primary motives for deeldlnr their votea,set it appeared to tbe committee that in man7 caLes no ad equate services were performed for those pa ments.

I The Committee thought it right to add that they were not of opinion that the issue of a new writ for the city of Oxford ought to be suspended. -MAIDSTONE. The committee sat at 11 o'clock. Evidence having been given in contradiction to that which had been adduced on the part of the petitioners, 3Ir. J. B. Beresford Hope, the sitting member, waw exarnined. He said that in 1855 he was requested by a deputation of gentlemen connected with the borough to stand for the borough at the next vacancy that occurred. An arrangement was made that unless his supporters thought he had a reasonable chance of success he should not be put to the expense of going to the poll. In the course of that interview he stated most emphatically that he would be answerable only for the legal expenses of his return. The deputation assented to his proposition, and he thereupon consented to stand. He stayed at the Mitre Hotel during the election, and was very cautions in his conduct, never offering as much as a glass of wine or a cup of tea to any person, not even to his colleague, Captain Scott, who was a voter of the borough. On one occasion Mrs. Hope asked a gentleman to take a cup of tea, and he reprimanded her; he told her she had done very wrong. He declared that up to the time of the election he was not aware that such a person as Mr. Marley was in existonce. Mr. Marley joined casually in the canvass. He had everyreason to believe from what he had seen during the election that it was as pure an election as had ever takei place. He might state, in corroboratfrn of his assertion, that the nuruher of voters who appeared bythebooks made up the evehiing before the elophion to have promised their votes to him corresponded wfithin four with the number he actually On cross-examination by Mr. PHiNr. 3rr. Hope said ho was a candidate for the borough in 1841 and in 1847. In 1855 Mr. Randall waited upon him to induce him to stand, and he consented upon the understanding that no improper practices should be resorted to. There was no contest in 1847, but after the election he sent 3,5(01. to the borough to defray the expenses of the election. (Laughter.) The CnsAiseAN intimated that the hon. gentleman was not bound to answer all the questions of the learned couilsel unless he pleased. In answer to further questions by Mr. ]aruc, Mlr. Hope said that a gentleman had caUed u 'on him' in town upon the subject, to whom he had hande2 notes forthe amount He understood that to be the cost of the election. He did not inquire in what manner the money had been expended. He believed a large portion of it went in charity. Accounts had been rendered. Money had been distributed to pbor freemen, at the Christmas charities, and to hospitalp, and, expended in the purchase of meat for the poor. In l852 he retired from the representation of the borough in coniqseghc'e of his vote in referenee to the Bill forthelegalization Qfnmar-' riage with a deceased wife'ssister. He wasgiventounderstand that in consequence of the unpopularity of that vote his reelection woul be extremely difficult. Between 1855 and. 1857 he had sent money to Maidstone for charity and for other purposem- -Last Christmah be ,ent about;S(j0l. Re it was proper that he should contribute to ics charities, as he resided in the neighbourhood. He was not a contributor to the funds of the Constitutional Society. In fact, he left the application of the snum ho contributed to charities very much to MIr. Randall. On re-examination he said it was distinctly understood at the last election that an end should be put to the old system. It was only upon that understanding that he consented to come forward. By the CHAIRIAui.-There was no contest in 1S47. He was not cognizant of the manner in which the 3,5001. paid by bin on aceount of that election was apolied By the ComITrEE=.-No money had been sent by him to Maidstone for election expenses since the last election. He should certainly resist any demand that might be made upon him for such expenses, Captain Sestt, the other sitting member, was then examined. He said he had resided at Maidstone since his return from India in 1842. The Constitutional Society had been established in consequence of the Reform Association having been established by the Liberals. There never was a purerelection at Maidstone than the last. As to saying at the Constitutional Society that he wished every man could have 201. for his vote, he observed that things were often said in joke that were not meant in earnest. At the conclusion of the evidence, Mr. VENABLES summed up, aud Mr. PNN replied upon the whole case, The Committee deliberated with closed doors for above an hour and a quarter. On the readmission of the public, The CHAIRMIAN said that before reading the resolutions at which the committee had arrived he was desirous, as there appeared to be considerable feeling with regard to this inquiry, to express a hope that no expression of opinion would be given on either side. The Committee had to report that Alexander James Beresford Hope, Esq., and Captain Edward Scott were duly elected burgesses to serve in the present Parliament for the borough of Maidstone. The Committee had furtber to report that the evidence laid before them had been very unsatisfactory and contradictory, but that there had been no sufficient proof of corruption. The Committeethought it necessary to add that it appeared that a sum of 3.50ii. was paid in the year 1847 for the expenses of the election of one candidate, although there was no contest upon that occasion. BURY. The Committee re-assembled this morning. Further evidence was given to establish the agency of Mr. Thomas Lomax Openshaw, but the Committee ultimately decided that the facts proved were not sufficient to show that Mr. Openshaw was the agent of Mr. Philips. Abraham Fletcher, the landlord of the Roebuck public. house at Bury, stated that at the last election Mr. James Wrigley engaged a room at his house as a committee-room for Mr. Philips. On the polling-day Thomas Cooper ordered him to supply bread, cheese, and beer for 35 watebers. Before doing so he showed the orders to him (James Wrigley), who said it was all right. After the examination of another witness, Mr. RODWELL intimated that after the decision of the committee as to the case of Thomas Lomax Openshaw he should offer no further evidence. The room was then cleared, and the Committee having remained for some time in deliberation, The CsAIRmAu N informed Mr. Monk that he need not address himself to disprove the charge of undue influence. nor of the bribery of Bury, nor to the cases of Spears and Moorhouse. Mri. MONK said he -was not then prepared to address the Committee, and applied for an adjournment. The application was acceded to, and the Committee adjourned about half-past 12 o7clock.
CnINA.-Further papers relating to the proceedings of our naval forces at Canton have been laid before Parliament and published. The dates extend from April 14 to 24. The papers include two de3patcbes from Sir J. Bowring to the Earl of Clarendon, enclosing a number of docaments seized on board a Mandarin junk by a party under Commodore Elliot. These are the letters of Chan-tze-tin, the ounger brother of Chan-kwei-tsib, President or Chief of the " Committee of Hostility" in San-on, the district on the coast of which is situate Rpngkong. There are two allusions to the great poisoning case, but not as an event wherein the San-on people took any direot part. It is clearly made out, howevor, that incendiary plots aind assassinations were devised by the San-on Committee, and attempted and effected by their agents, who, wehen successful, were rewarded. The English are, as usual, honoured by this adept in the art of polite istter-writing with the appellation of Mx. WOODIN.-The " Olio of Oddities," which is 8s composed as to take in any topic of the day that may suit the genius of tbe impersonating "entertainer," ha3 recently been seasoned with a clever imitation of Madame Ri3tori. At the end of a modest address, in which Mr. Woodin in propi-i4 persond declares that he has no inten-u tion of caricaturing the great actress, the curtains of the stage are closed, and on being removed, after the lapse of a few minutes, discover the same Mr. Woodin completely attired as the Historian Medea, even to the hem of the robe and the curl of the ringlet, lying at the foot of the ohild-devouriag statue. Tho famous soliloquy of M. Ldgonvd's tragedy is then delivered, with an imitation of the voice, accent, and gesticulation of Madame Ristori that proves a close study of her peculiarities. This feat 4' mimicry ia performed in the beet possible taste, the elegance of the stage arrangement being, in itself worthy f oiom. , nendstion.
' TlE GLANOW POISONING CASE. I. 48 TRIAL OF 1IADERLEN SMITE. TtESDAY, JuLy 7.-SxvmS VAy. -7he High Court ofJusticiary resumed this morning at 10 'clock, and the sitting was occupied with the speech of the Lord Advocate for the prosecution. ,The LORD ADVOCATE said,-Gentlemen of the jury, after an investigatIon which, for its length, has proeVed unexampled, I believe, inthecriminalanais ofthiscountr-., I have now to discharge perhaps the most painful public duty that ever fell to my lot. Gentlemen, I should have Wished that the result of the inquiry which it was our duty to make, and the laborious collection of every element of proof which wo could find, would have justified us on the part of the Crown in resting content vith the investigation into the facts, and withdrawing our charge against the prisoner. Gentlemen, I grieve to Say, so far is that from being the result to which we have come, that if you give me your attention for I fear the somewhat lengthened trespass on your patience which I shall have to make, you will come to the conclusion that every link in the chain of evi. dence is so firmly fastened, every loophole is so comp!etely stopped, that there does not remain the possibility of escape for the unhappy prisoner from the net that she has woven around herself. The indictment against the prisoner charges two separate acts of administering poison with intent to kill; and the third charge is the successful administering of poison with intent to kill, viz.,-murder. They are charges to which, in some respects, different parts of the evidence apply; but they hang together; they throw Jigbt upon each other; they are not unconnected acts of crime. Our case is that tho administration with intent to poison was truly part of a design to kill; on the other hand, the facts of the death throw light on the previous acts of administration. Gentlemen, in stating to you the evidence (n which we think that these charges mus be found proved, .I shall avoid, as far as possible, travelUng into a region which this case affords too great materials for-I mean alluding to the almo3t incredible evidence that discovers a *saerne of degradation; the social pictare which this case has revealed, the fearful domestio results which must inevitably follow, those feelngs of commiseration and horror which the age, the sex, and the condition of the prisoner must produce in every mind-all these are things into which I sall not travel. They might unnerve me for the discharge of my painful public duty. Besides, no language of mine, no language of my eloquent and leamed friend opposite, can paint to the mind one-tenth of the impression which the bare recital of the details of this case has already created throughout the whole of this country. I shall onlY say that these matters weigh in my mid, as I am sure they do in yours, with a we5ght and an oppresdson which neither requires nor admits of expression. The only other remark of that kind which I shall make is that while a prisoner in the position of this unfortunate lady is entitled, justly entitled to say that such a crime shall not be lightly presumed or proved against her, yet, gentlemen, if the charges in the indictment be true, if the tale which I have to teU and lave told be a true one, you are trying a case of as cruel, premeditated, deliberate homicide as ever justly brought its perpetrator witbin the compass and penalty of the law. The first important point in this inquiry is that the deceased Elnile L'Aagelier, died of arsenic. The symptoms he exhibited were those of poisoning by arsenic; the stomach and intestines whern examined and analysed were found to conta!n a great quantity of arsenic. The next question which comes is,-by whom was that poison adminhtered ? That traly constitutes the inquiry which you have now to answer, In1passing from the C07pU8 delicti, so to speak-in passing from the cause of L'Aagelier's death-I do not alude to a theory which barely crossed my mind during the reading of tbh evidence yesterday as a posaible case to be made in the defence, that the arsenic which was in the stomach of L'Angelier was to be attributed to other causes; and that, in,trath, his death arose from bihiary derangement or from cholera, Gentleinen, that is a theory which it is inipossible to maintain. I pass from that at present, acfilI shaU assame, during the rest of my argument, that L'Angelier died from the administration of arsenic. Pas*ing from that, then, I now proceed to inquire what is the evidence that connects the prisoner at the bar with the death of L'Angelier. The painful details of this case may be. briefly saated as follows :-This young lady (the prisoner) returned from a London boarding-school in the year 1853i She mnet L'Angeli*r somewhere I believe about 1855. JAngelier's history has not been very clearly brought out. At is plain; ruiquestionaSly, that in 1851 he vas,in very poor and destitute circmstances. Of his character I say nothing kt'presnt but this, that it is quite clear that by energy and attention- he had won his way up to a position that was at least respectable-a position in which those who came in contact'with him plainly had for him a very considerable regard., 1i is no. part of my case to knaintain the character tafhf;iIh b Se e Ie fntisases k itim.~ possible to speakof himninanyterms but those of verystrong co,deiirnationi Bat'still it is plain that when Miss SO-th 1 ecame finrstacqaintea with L'Angelier he wasamaumonog wnS rispuit'abla positon, bearing a respectable character, 3iked by all those-who came in contact with him, spoken ff by the three landladies with whom he lodged in the highest'possible terms-a man of whom the Chancellor of the Frrench Consulate spoke as respectable and steady, a man spoken of by his employers and by his fellow-clerks in Huggihs' warehouse also in the highest terms. These two persons met; they weie introduced, I assume, clandestinely. After a time, -it, seems, ai attachment commenced, which was forbidden by her parents. It is only right to say that the letters of the prisoner at that time show good feeling, prooper affection, and a proper sense of duty. This went on; the inturc'6urse was again renewed, and in the course of 1V56, as you must have found, it assumed a criminal aspect. Prom that time down to the end of the year, not once or t iie, butrepeatedly acts of improper connexion took place between them; and by the end of 1856 she had so completely committed herself to him that she belonged to niin, aid cobld ;with, honour belong to no one else. But her affection began. to cool; another suitor apreared; she endeavoured to break off her connexion with L'Angelier by coldness, and asked him to return her letters. He refused, and threatened to put them into the hands of her fatber. There is much that is dishonourable in 'this case, but not that. It would not have been hononrable to allow the prisoner at the bar to become the wife of any honest man. It was then she saw the position she was in; she knew what letters she had written to L'Kngelier; she knew what he could reveal; she knew that, if those letters were sent to her father, not only -would her marriage with Mr. Minnoch be broken off, but that she could not hold up her head again. She writes in despair to him to give her back her letters; he refuses. There is one incident-she attempts to buy prusaic aoid; there is another incident-she bought arsenio; there is a third incident- she bought arsenic again. IIer letters, instead of dosnands for the recovery of her letters being containedinthem, akdin assume all the warmth of affection they had the vear before. On the 12th of March she has been with Mr. Minnoch making arrangementgforher maTriage. Onthe21st sheinvites L'Angelier to come, with aU the ardour of passion, to see he; she buys arsenic on the 18th, and L'Angelier dies o£ poison on the morning of the 23d. The story is strange - in its horrors almost incredible. No one can wonder that such a story has carried a thriU of horror into everv family. The prisoner is entitled to every presumption which can be given her; but if, as I am certainly bound, I bring before yore such proof as to carry conviction to your minds that no reasonable man can doubt-that no reasonable ray of doubt can penetrate the judgment, then, incredible as the story is, and fearful as the result of your verdict must be, wehave noalternative,in the discharge of ourpublic duty,but myself to ask, and. you to give, that verdict which the facts of the ease, if proved, demand. In cases of this kind-in occult cAses especially-the ends of justice -would be perpetually defeated if you were to say you will not convict a map urnless you find some person who saw the crime committed. B:t in the case of administration of poison that remark applies with peculiar force. In truth, the fact of administering poison before witnesses is so far from affording, in the first instance, a presumption of guilt, that it sometimes is the strongest proof of innocence. We all remember a case which attracted 55 much attention in a sister country as this ham done in this. Thecalpritthere satbythebedside of his victim, surrounded by medical attendants, gave him the poison in their presence, sat and witnessed its effect, sawr his dying aVonies with a coolness which could hardly be believed. There could hardly be a strongerpresusmption of his innocence than that; and the result was that he very nearly had entirely escaped suspicon from the fact that the thing was done openly: And, therefore, in the case of the administration of poison, the fact of there being no eyewitness to the administration iSDotr an element of much weighb in the inquiry. You may assume that if it Was done with a guilty intenton it was doe seeretly:- The question is, wbether we have evidence .to trace the crime from the course of the cir- cnmstances. Now, having thus given You an outline of the nature of the evidence, I go on to consrder that evidence in detail; and I shall endeavour to do that in a manner which shall bring clearly before you how these facts in their order bear upon the crime alleged, tAfter reading from some of the earlier letters, in some Of wvhich the prisoner addresses tbhe deceased as " h'sband," but whEich bear no evidence of any impropriety between them, beyond the clandestine character of their intercourse, the Lord Advocate quoted some passages from the let,ter of the 'Wh of May, 1856]:- d My own.,nmy belowed Huabaund,-I trust to 'od you got home srfe, r were not rauch the worse of being out. Thank you. my loeo, for ~e1y~dIf e dd won lat sg.b itwasinthe exoltement of our That letter speaks language not to be mistaken, From that period dates th;e commnencement of the criminal intimacy between t hseprrties The letfers betseen that date in moa arid the end df the year are written in a strain that really I do mnot tistle I should comment upon. I can say this, that tl'5 expressions in these letters-the language in which they are ouched-the matters to whBich they refer-do so Lentirely overthrow the moral sense-the sease of moral Idelicacy and decency-as to create a picture which I do, i not know ever had a parallel in an inquiry of this sor. In one of her letters she glosses over the matter by saying, "Our intimaOy has not been criminal, as I amyour wifo. before God." The Lord Advoqate then qutot.d LT= am% of the letters i'ritten towards the clee of 1856, showing the difficult paft she had to play between receiving the ad. dresses of Mr. finnoch and holding her clandestine interviews and correspondence with tho deceased. The letters thenbegan to show that the prisoner's first paroxysms of love had ceased, and that her affection towards L'Angelier had cooled. The reason of that, his Lordship ssid, it isnot necessary that we should discern. He seems to have been rather exacting; but, whatever the reason might be, it is cVnite plain that a change came over her affection about this time. Mr. Mlinaoch has told you that during the whole of this winter there was a tacit understanding between them that they were lovers. She alludes to this in her letters when sh reers to the reports about her and denies that there is any truth in them. And now, geontiemen, said his Lordship, having traced the correspondence down to this date, proving the greatest intimacy between the parties, proving the correspondence to be of such a character that no eye could see it without her character being utterly blasted, proving also vows, over and over repeated, that, after her intimacy with him, she could be his wife, snd that of no other, as to be so would be sin; having intimate in, as atrong language as she could that for Mr. Minnoch she had no affection whatever; that she had at no time whateverfAiVted with him or any one else, being his wife; having prrved all this down to the end of 1856, we come to the crisis of this tragedy. On the 2d - of February she wrote to the decea&d;- *When yon are not pleased with the leilrsf t send you, then our cOrcespondesce shall be atan end: and u there-Isa eoolnes on both sues, oum engagement had better be broken." These are the very words that Kennedy told- you L'Angelier repeated to him on the morning when hc- entered the coanting-house so mach distressed. She says farther,- *' Yon have more thau once r4tumed me my letter, and my mlnd wanmadoeupthatlbsoulduatstand bthesamething-again. And you alsozauoyeda mauuchon Saturday by youreanuductin eominrrnesar me; altogether.

Four days before that letter was written she woe engaged to. Mr. Mindoch. There is a postscript to this impertant letter, in which she says- ,' Yon may be astonisbet at thli sudden chatige, but for r-ome time back you mntot have n4loed a colnessi in my notes.

What baa%Rtsedyouw,illnotlmention. rkuow when Iasa you that you will oomply," Gentlemen, what a labyrinth-what a wilderneas this unhappy girl, first by her love, and then by her want of prudence, was drawing into ! She triea to break off this engagement because she says there was coolness on both sides, which I dare say on her part was not affected. She says she hrs no other reason for her conduct but that she has lost her love for I'Angelier-sbe says this when she knows that the actual reason as that she bas pledged her word to another. She tells L'A.gelier that her affection was withdrawn in the hope that his indignant spirit would induce him to turn her off, when she would be free to form another engagement. But, gentlemen, she had the dreadful recol. .ect-on of the existence of her correspondence. She did not know how much L'Angelier had, but she knew that she was completely in his power. Gentlemen, she did not hear from 1'Angelier for more than a week. She accordingly wrote to him again, appointing the interview a week later. She had got no answer to the demand for her letters, and she writes a short cold letter saying everything is broken off, and making a second appointmnent for the delivery of her letters. L'Angelier refused to give np the letters, at leist to give them up to her. He told Miss Perry, and he told Mfr. Kennedy, that he would not give up the letters, but that, on the contrary, he would show them to her fatbet. ow, gentlemen, in other circumstanecs, and had matters not gone so far between these unfortunato persons, it might have been considered a dishonourable and ungenerous thing in a man in L'Angelier's position; but whether it was or not is not material to the matter in hand. I mrost say, however, that in the position in which the prisoner and L'Angelier stood, I do not see how he, as a man of honour, could allow this marriage with hMr. Minnoch to take place and remain silent. It may be doubted whether or not they were man and wife by the law of Scotland. It is needless to discuss this question. There are materials in this correspondence that this view might be maintained bv L'Angelier had he choseinto do it, and that he considered the prisoner his wife tobugh they had not been married in a regular and respectable manner. He considered her his wife, and so thinking he was right not to give the letters. RecollectIng what is tbe strain of herformerletters, listen to what she saystolhim on the 9th of Febrmaryod "'EmLe,-l have just had your note. xmuile, for the love you once had for me do nothing till Isee sou.

You wil also observe that throughout aU this despair there is no talk of renewing her engagement with L'Angelier. Her object was to be in a position to fulfil her eDgagement with Minnbeh.. Now, gentlemen, we have traced the matter up to I this point. She is so committed that she cannot extricate herself, and yet, if not extricated, her character, her fame, her reputation, her position, are forfeited for ever. In her next letter she says,- " Emilelfr the love you once hab for me. do nto denonrnce me to mny5.

If hie is to get your lePters I cannot see amtoilto-night."td u r;eilI Gentlemen, said his lordship, I never in my life had so harrowing a task as raking up and bringing before such a tribunal and audience as this the outpourings of such a despairing spirit, and in such a position as this miserable girl was. Such words as these paraded in public under any CircUmStances would bo intolerable agony, but the circumstances of this case throw aU these considerations utterly into the shade, and if for a moment they do obtrude themselves upon us they must be repelled, for our duty is a stern one, and cannot yield to such considerations. Pausing there for a moment, let me take in some surrounding circumstances; at the same time, L'Angelier, wbatever were his faults, was certainlytrue to her. He spoke to Kennedy about her. He said his love for her was infatuation, and that it would be the death of him. It was not revenge that he wanted: he wanted his wife; and he plainly had told her that he would not permit eir engagement to be broken off, and that he would put these letters into her father's hands. The Lord Advocate tben referred to the prisoner sending the page* for prussic acid, and asked for what purpose she wanitd it. Some extrication, he said, was inevitable, if she hoped to save her character, and with a strength of will which I think she exhibited in some more passages in this case, she resolved she would not go back to L'Angelier; she had ceased to love him; she had determined to marry another. And throughout all this, while she as in utter despair, and tries to move him by her protestations, there is not tho slightest indication of an intention to go back and love him, and he his wife. The Lord Advocate then adverted to Christina Haggart's evidence as to the secret interview the prisoner and deceased had in the back room of the house one day-some weeks, but not-two months before the prisoner's apprehension. You will- find, he- said, allusion in these letters to embraces, interviews, and things that oould only have taken place in the house, and she says distinctly that he might come without fear, for no oneowonld see him, and that they would haveoaniinterview. That one interview took place we have the direct testimony of one witness. What took plaoe at that inter. view we cannot tell; but we find this, that in oneoway or another, this feud had been made up, that the- whole tuing ad een arranged; and how arranged? Not certainly, gentlemen, on the footing of givig up the letters. Nob certainly on the footing of the prisoner not continuing her en6agement w^ith L'rXngeler; but, on the opposite footing, npon the tooting of the engagement contin-aing. How was that to extricate the prisoner? What did shDe propos. to herself to do? She had found that L'Angelier would not give up theletters. Shedidnot goon to endeavour'I;oinduce him to dce so by despairing petitions, She took anotier line, and- that linuswaspretending-becanseit could not bereal-pretending to adopt the old tone of love and alhction; all this time keeping the engagement with MTr. Minnoch, receiving thecongratulations of het friends, receiving presents frombim, and engaged in fixing the time of her unica. She asks for those letters tbat she bad written in her cool moments, to-coavince L'Angelier that she is as true io-him as evor; but she makes an appointment for Tnausd4y, and iS that letter was written according to the postmar.l, plainly the quarrel has heen made up, anit it mutst have been after the date of these despidring letters. Tho day was Thursday, the 19th of Februnay. Wo are now coming to the very crisis of the case. On Theaday, the 17th of Febrnary, L'Angeller dl led with Miss Perry. He told her he was to see Miss SmiYa on the Thnrsday. Thursday was the 19th, and he aftqfcward& told Miss Perry that he had seen her on the 19th- some dlay before the 22d of February, as I say the 19th of debruwyana you will see whetebr that is proved or not imirsediately. L'Angelier in the middle of the night was seizr d with a sudden illness. You heard it described by his ?sandlxdy, Mrs. Jenkins. It was vomiting andl Purging, vO,'imting a green stuff, and excessive pain. He lay on the fli,or all might. He was so ill that he could not call for asalstance some time, and his landlady found him in the ms orning. At last he was relieved, but only after a great deal of suffering. These symptoms -were the symptor Us of arsenic, whether or not they bore any resem7 lance to the symptoms of cholera. He recovered, 'and he went out on the day after, on the 20th. Oa the 21st the prisoner purebased arsenic at the shop of .sr. Murdoch--*very singular purchase, gentlemen, fo2 ae Irson in her position to make. But it was not the ftzsS h .ne in the history of this case that she had tried to hay Tp oisen; she had tried to buy prosaic acid before their tee' in2 of the 11th. When shte went to Murdoch's shop ails ashied for the arsenic openly, but tho story she told in zdhQ&wa5, upon her owFnconfession, an asoilute faIsL'ooa; she said she wanted it to poison rata at Btows She 91terwards gave another reason for it, which WO shlLL also0 bste to consider. Having pLrchased that arsenld Omt theo 21st, accoirding to my taltement, L'Angelier saw her an the 22d, wlich was a Sunday, and'on the night of the 221 and the morning of the 23dhe was again seized with the vr symptomathatsehadl had before-theidenticalyp very, asomewhat, milder form-namely, thegenolting Jag~ short, whica you wouldlexpectinacaseofasnclosntg L'Anjgelier told blis5 Perry. that lhe h1ad a 1n th rOisDner on the 19th, thathle had been ill immediately after ts a 19th, and that' he had afterwards been ill-after the 22d and 23sf -I don't know that she named thos dattes, but she certairnlyl said he was twice ill before she saw him, jan be tod her this-that these two illnesses had followed after recsveivin coffee one time, and chocolate another tina. frora the hands, of the prisoner..: Now; if thaLt be true, and if he certainaly. said so, then it iroertain that be saw her upon the 19th land that he saw her upon the 22d ; and in c roboration of that wil y!ou listexi to i-letter, which wees found isa the tourhtwa. b3g, the date of which is in disput%,, but which I say war Wednesday, the2Sth'of February ?

YOU Will asoS consider, what weighs on my mind, w'hat war~ the nature of the, arrangemnent betwein L~Angelier and Mire. dmifcties Ho did she propose to extricate herself from the difmte nwhich s'he found herself placed? She had' everything at stake-character, fame, fortune, and everything else. She knew she could not get baick her letters byentreaties, and she did not endeavour to get them by thatmeans any longer, but professe to adhere to *their engagement? 'hat didl she contemplate at this- momaent? For the first time she beginis to purchase, or" endeavour to purchase, pruasia acidl. And now, gen- tlemen, for the arsenic. What reawn do-es she give for the purchase of the arsenic?1 She says she had been told, when at scheel in England, by a Miss Giubilei, that arsnic is good for the complexion. She came fronmschool inL 1853, and, singular enough, it is not till that weelo of February prior to the 22dl that she even thintks of arsenica for that purpose. Why, gentlemen, should? that be ? At. that maoment I have shown you she was frightened, at the danger she was in in the highest degree, and is it likely that atthat time she was looking foranew cosmetic? But what. is the truth as to what sbe had hea-rd, or very likely read ? What is the use of the arsenic, and what does she say ? She says that she poured it all into a basin, and washed her face'.- wvith it. Gentlemen, do you believe -that? If she was following up what she found in the magazine, that was not what she found there ; for- they say that the way to use arsenic is to swallow-it in extremely small quantities Therefore youi would, have to say whether youL believe that she got the arsenic for the puxrpose she says.- She says she used the whole quantity each time in a basi of water. I fear, gentlemen, there is but one conclusion, and that is that there is not a word of truth in the excuse ; and if, therefore, you think there are two falsehoods herm abouLt the poisoning-the first told in the druggist's shop, and the second m'ade in her declaration-I fear the con. elusion Is inevitable, that the purpose for which she had. purchased it was a criminal one, and that, taking all the circumstances together; you cannot possibly douLbt that the object was to use at for the purpose of poisoning L'Angelier. But this time it failed,; he is excessively 'ill, but recovers. How she got the poisont on the 19th I say at once I am unalble to account for. Bat yon will recollect what the symptoms were, and with the other evidence I have brought to bear upon this critical period, from the 119th to the 27th of February, I leave you to judge whether, at all events, it is not certain, fir-st, that they meot on these two occaslons; second, that he got something from her on bothi oacsions; and, third, that his illness succeeded immediately aftr having got a cup of coffee in'the first place And a cup of cocoa' in the second;- andI that, in t'he last place, these illneses took ~place.under circumstances which led him tosay, half in joke, half in earnest, the old story,, "I f waA-oosnm4-ould forgive her." Miss Perry does not say this was a serious belief. It would appear to have been a floating notionm which coursed through his brain, and I suppose he drove it away. We shall see what happened to drive it away; we shall see protestations of renewed love, which- probably made him believe that this phantom, suddenly conjured usp, was, after all, a maere delusion of hIds brain. After referring to what p sesi the interval L'Angelier going to Edinburgh, andafterwards to Bridge of Allan to recrmit his health, and she recommending him to go to the Isle of 'Wight, the LordAdvocate remnarked -The prisoner had made the attempt at poison on two occasions and bad failed, Apparently her heart was now touched and probably she thought that if she could get him out of the way she imight have her marriage with Mr. Minnoch over without his knowledge, %fter which it would be easy to get her letters, as there would be no motive for keeping them. But the prisoner lees not succee in her wish, and in answer to her letters, still warm in tone, but not in the old spirit, L'Angelier writes her a letter, of which a copy has been preserved. In it he expresses suspicion that there is foundation for th-a report of the prisoneresintended marriage with 3Mr.Misinoch, lemands an explanation about the necklace presented to, her, direct answers to the questions she had before evaded. and asks why she wis'hes so very much that he should go 509 miles off to the Isle of Wight. Then, when the prisoner found the toils coming closer around her, L'Angelier aeterminedl not to be put off, and she herself pledged bo an absolute falsehood-viz.) that the report of her marriage is not true-she purchases another dose of arsenic. Dra your on conqluaiou., gentlemen ; I fear you wilI tdbuton at 'which it i-s possible for you to ariTve. His LordshinD then adverted to L'Angelier's 'viait to Bridge of Allan, hi~ anxiety for a letter, his immediate return to Glasgow on a letter being forwarded to, him. He ret urned, he said, in perfect health. He was, Mrs. Jenkins says, looking infinitely improved since he left her on the 19th. He edine home- in the greatest spirits, and.told them that the lAtter bad brought him home. They knew,and he made no secret of why he had come home. The landlady knew sowell that when he went out at night he was going to see his sweetheart that she never askedl him any questions on these occasions. He stayedlin the hoee, took some tea, and left the house in his usual health a little after or before 9' o'clockc. He is seen sauntering along in. the dlirection of Blytbswood-square about 29minutes past 9i Itis too early. He knows the ways. of the house, and knows that they have prayers on Sunday *iht,. He must begtuie the time a little, and so he goes- past Blythswood-square, down to the other side and makes a.call on his acquaintancehl'Alister, in Terrace.street, but does-not findl him at home. T'he maidservant recognized hina~ and' says he was taere about half-past 9 o'clook. Here weloseI sight of him for a period of two or three hours; bout there iLs no. attempt to 'ihow that any mortal man saw him anywhere else than the saly place he was going to. lie- went out with the deter. mination of seeing the prisonor ; and, believing that he- had an appointment at that place, you cannot doubt that.. after ooming from the Bridge- of Alflan poat. haste to see ber, walkng first from the Bridge of Allan to Stirling, Ihen travelling from Stirling to. Ceatbridge, walking. from Coathbridge to Glasgow, &nd then walking from his lodgings in the direction, of- Blythswood-equare-~you. lannot believe that he wouldr give up his, purpose within. L00 yards of the hotuse. The thingis incredible-imspossible. Well, gentlemen, as.-I saLid, 21& knew the ways of the- house ; he knew when it was the hAbit ef the fsmily to retire to. rest an tha hewoul hav&t wai til Jaet as-asleep.

So ends this melancholy tale that I have taken so long to toll you. Now, gentlemen, I shall have to speak as to the idea of suicide. he evidence of Mrs. Jenkins from first to last shows that.

2!HE JEWS IN 2UNIA TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-At the request of a friend at Tunis we take the liberty of transmitting you herewith a translation eC- the account of a very sad ocourence, arising from Mahomedan fanaticism, that bas recently taken place. We are informed that copies of the original document, bearing the signature of many European residents of various denominations, have been addressed by several consuls, our own among the number, to their respective Governments, and that meas have been taken to obtan Its insertion in the principal E-uropean journals. To our charge is committed the care of procuring its admission into the leading London papers, and in the hope that it will not be refused a place In 27wc Times, We remain your obedient servants, BENOLIEL BROTHRS. 4, Culum-atree, July 8. " On Friday, the 26th of this month, an act of tyranny was perpetrated by the Bey of Tunis worthy of the most barbarous times, and which gave a ghastly triumph to fals hood, ignorance, fanaticism, andabuseof power. " A native Jew having been accused of curaing a Mlussulman, and so offending against the laws of Mahomed, he was immediately arrested and taken before the Bey, who commanded that he should be tried by the Religious Tribunal. This tribunal, cormposed of fanatics-fanatics in the rancour and hatred with which they look u n everything that is not lahomedan,-after placing the Jew in the stocks, and inflicting the most crud tortures, condemned him to a fearful death without considering the terrible disproportion of the punishment-without caring about the proof that was demanded, but, on the contrary, bringing to its assistance falae testimony. The verdicts of these tribunals cannot be carried into effect without the sanction of the Bey, so that he might have revoked a sentence dictated by fanaticism and by the lowest passion and hate, instead of by the noble feelings of justice; but what will be said when it is known that the Bey, giving himself up to the same degrading sentiments, not only confirmed the sentence, but ordered its instant eecution,* in spite of the remonstrances of the English, French, Austrian, and Sardinian consuls, and of the American consul's protest,-in spite of the prayers of many others, in spite of the apparent disgust of the whole European and Jewish population. As if the wretched victim bad not paid a sufficient penalty with his life, his corpse was left to the rzge of the mob, and would have been draggea through the whole place but fora party of zealous Israehtes, Vho, daring the ferocity of the multitude, succeeded-not, however,without bruises and wounds-incarryingoffthebody ind giving it sepulture. Such an act cannot butprovoke the indignationof every feeling heart, and must have a most balefuleffect in establishing the triumphof fanaticismoverevery consideration of humanity, justice, or proportion of punishment to crime-fanaticism suppressed daring the more tolerant rule of the late Ahmed Pasha, but again rekindled in the very first acts of the present Bey-fanaticism that places human life at the disposal of an inquisitorial tribunal, and that passes judgment un manifestly false evidencetfafiticism upon wh oh not g can have inlluence, not eeen the representativesof the most powerful nations-fanaticism that divests the fact we are namting of its apparently personal character, to give it a much more Important and extended one-one afrecting the whole of Europe, for we must not conceal from ourselves that the sad event in question may lead to many others likely enough to seriously endanger in varous ways the personal safety of Europea7s established n these uncivilized countries, as well as the moral authority of the representativea Of their respective Governments. "It is but too probable that if some mens are not devised tkepthe religious frenzy of the Mussulman clergy within boueds the respectw hich the.advanced id¢as and the influence of neighbouring Powers had obtained for the life and the institutions of the European element in thls country will to a oertain degree be louL The fatal event vre have now to deplore and the passions that it has excited ruay with but little further provocation, impel any of us to acts which, however trifLing in themselves, would beo sfficient, a we have seen, to call down the rmost cruel vengeaace. "And we who kave been placed -by Divine krovldenco under the protection of laws that ensure the rlghts of mca-we, whose hearts have been trained to humanity and justioe-we cannot allow our personal safety to be imperilled, neither can we remain indifferent epectators of the oppre. sion and injustice under which the Inoffensive and the weak are made to languish. We therefore wh to give every publicity to this fearful tragedy, so that it may he known everywhere, so that European civilization may protest against similar _orrors, and so that our benigant Govern ment, whose giorious flag has always been covered with honour in the defence of right against might and barbarism, may, in union with the other great Powers, insist upon the creation of a new system that shall so far rebtrain those passions the Bey of Tunis has thonght fit to chappon as to prevent their again resulting in acts of ferocty like the one we have narrated." * "It Is a Mahromedan custom not to inflct captal punishment on a Fridayi nevertheles, the exeoanton took place In th' cse, in odet to avoid delay, during which the Bey misht have been indoced to give way to a more humane counsel, or to conuWar luSltence. t " A peat number of persons. sevral of thetn notsris declare4 hastle heard the expreesonas made we of tby the Jew, whichwere construed intoan offence againat the Mabomedan reliion: all, however state unanimously in his exeulpation that be was drunk; but the opposing witnese swore to the oontrary."

ZONDOMj TRU=AY, JULY 9, 15. In the House-of Commonryeterday, at the time of privato.buuiiwss, the Tha esConservancy Bill, which,. althogls neesaIy introduced as a private Bill, was not w.ithQut fe.ate of h public characters underwent a'fiurther discussion of some length upon the question of its third relg ich was carried upon a diVision by a large mnjoritg and the Bill pased. The CArcxr.ono of the ExcHEQUZV in laying upon the table an estimate for a vote of 500,OO. on account of the Persian war, which he moved should be referred to a Committee of Supply, Intl. mated his intention to move a resolution in a Committee of Ways and Means whereon to foiud aBil to arrest the faU of the tea and sugar dutier. Mr. RonBucu protested against the House being left in ignorance of the hoUlities with Persia until called upon to pay the bill. Sir H. WILOuaGHBY inquired whether the 500,0001. would include the 260,0001., the sum firat named; whether, as the East India Company were to pay half the expense of the war, the whole cost woulddbe 1,000,0001. ? The CsrANcuron of the ExCHEQUER replied that the 500,0001. was inclusive of the 260,0001., and that there would be no addition to that sum during the present session. Mr. ScoTr pressed for more explicit information as to the total expense. The CHANCT,Or of the EXCHEQUER said, he was not askiDg the House to agree to the vote, and that the proper place to discuss it was in a Coramittee of Supply, where the Government would be prepared to give full information upon the subject, involving an answer to Mr. ScoTT's question. Sir J. PAsiNGTox rose to order, and complained that the C wOmioR of the ExcRzQuim had taken an unusual and irregular course in making a motion without noticeuponan order day and a Wednesday. Mr. IBOUHcuX and Sir G. Gazy insisted that the proceeding was consiatent with the universal practice, the motion to refer the estimate to a Com. mittee of Supply being a matter of course. The SPERn took the same view, but, the de. bate continuing, Sir J. PAxwGToN moved that it be adjourned. This motion was afterwards withdrawn, and the motion to refer the estimate to a Committee of Supply was agreed to. The House then went again into committee upon the remaining clauses of the Industrial Schools Bill, which were agreed to, after much discus3ion and certain amendments. Mr. E. EGXmTow brought up the report of the Comnittee on the Oxford Election, which stated that Mr. Nnsrx was not duly elected; that the election, so far as regarded him, was a void election, and that he had by his agents been gailty of bribery. Al. G. A. HAMMToN brought up the report of the Maidstone Election Committee, which had found the sitting members to have been duly elected. After some further business the House adjoumed at 6 o'clock.
The English people-a problem, as all philosophers call them-offer at thuis moment a spectacle more - tan usually singular and characteritic. Is it a just confidence in our character and position, or is it an ignorant rashness, which makes so many of us look for the arrival of the next nevws from India, now expected every day,-in three or four days at the latest,-with about as much interest as we should an overdue Austrahan steamer or the result of a rising at Madrid? They, indeed, who have friends in India have their own anxieties and speculations, for the Mfail which may announce the entire suppression of the mutiny may bring all the cost of valuable lives at which it has been purchased. But the British public, as a whole, looks and talks as if many a like danger had vanished as soon as known, and as if our good fortune or invincible courage must carry us as easily through a Sepoy mutiny. Yet what is the fact, and how does that fact address itself to the geographical ideas of our continental neighbours? The fact is. a growing disstisfaction and a sudden mutiny, long lurking and eventually breaking out for the length of a thousand miles across the whole Peninsula, suppressed with cautions tact and a great display of force at Calcutta and iin the Punjab, but triumphant so far at the ancient capital of the Mogul Empire, tie prophetic seat of power. This is the state of things in a territory where less than 50,000 Europeans of all kinds hold in subjection seventimes their, number of armed men and a population of 170,000,000. The meshes of such a fabric cannot be very close. The stations must be very wide apart, the commuxnications- difficult- aud slow, the detachments must be numerous and small; the travelleramej,andbut feeblyescorted. Nothing but prestige, a word so often applied to Indian affairs as to have become an Orientalism, can give strength to so flimsy a web and lul the tempest that, once raised, would sweep away every thread of Aiti Think how many French troops are necessaryin Algeria, scarcely out of sight of their native ahores, and along a thin coast! Yet, if the Hindoos are not generally a warlike race, there are still mixed up with them, and forming the best part of the native army, numerous races much stronger and more ambitious. We deal with the descendants of conquerors; with those who still inherit titles of sovereignty; with hardy mountaineers; with recent marauders; with men whose very strength and savageness made it politic to enlist them. The scene of the long smouldering discontent and the sudden outbreak is a vast country, much of which is little known, but where conspir-acy lurks in populations created by ourselves, and breaks out at the very head-quarters of our dominion. Such are the hard facts of the case, and bystanders who look at the hard facts must marvel at our composure. But, after' all, this is not the blind faith in a destiny or the rash confidence in our arms that a bystander might suppose. We know the danger, and calculate it. We know what the next Ma:l may possibly bring, and we have also our estimate. When General ANsoN concentrates his forces on Delhi, which at the last date seemed only a matter of time, and of a very short time, it is a question whether the insurgents will attempt to hold the city at the risk of entire destruction, or follow their own more natural tastes, as well as the safer course, by breaking up and scattering themselves over the country. In the former case, without leaders, without artillery, ammunition, or stores, within a wide circle of ancient walls, and with no power of defending any one part of the city without sacrificing the-rest, they must soon surrender at discretion, or abide the terrible issue of an assault. No doubt, they reckon somewhat on the name of the city and on the fanatical'character of the MIahomedan population. They may, too, expect that a little perseverance may win support from the neighbouring States, whose fidelity we .cannot reckon upon in the case of a reverse. But to this course we see only one result,- in which the treatment of the Mogul capital must be determined by military and political considerations. Should the insurgents anticipate the siege by flight, then, no doubt, they will give us much trouble of a harassing, but less serious, character. But we have already seen how they have been received in their flight by those native chiefs to whose syapathy theyappealed& in an hour of tenmporary succes. As fugitives they will nowhere be able to make head against us. The example of their dispersion must tell everywhere; and whatever credit has attached to the possession of Delhi must redound to the disgrace of their cause. This disposes of the two great alternatives before us. In either case, however,we must still prepare our minds for lamentable events at othier places than Delhi. There is too -much reason.to fear that European offlcers atthe smaller stations, or traveling perhaps is ignorance of these events, may be surprised by asiassis or by excited cro mds-possibfy by the dispersed mutinee. Te number of such casualtties will partly depend on the interval - allowedt pass betweien the rft outbreak and the final retribution. Therefore it is of the utmost inhportiice- that the latter should be as speedy and ,ignaL as the strength and disposition of the army will allow. Every day that leaves Delhi in the hands of the men who have massacred the British population,-every day thatsees them unpunished, will certainly add to the list of European victims. The Sepoys have not yet stood their ground anywhere, for one minute, aggainst so much as a company or a troop of European soldiers. They have only surprised and murdered officers while addressing them, or even unconscious of danger. Of course, it is not to be inferred that they will never stand their ground under resolute officers or when urged by desperation. They may, as other semi-barbarians have been before them, be encouraged to a formidable degreo of self-copfidence by the fatal blunders or unavoidable disasters of the Europeans. But this can only be a transient delusion, and there can be no doubl the lesson which the Sepoym have already received will be repeated with increasing force, and be the last left on their minds. This certainly suggests some serious considerations as to the relations to be observed for the fature between the numbers of the European and the native army. Long ago, on the cessation of the late wars, experienced British officers were strongly in favour of the reduction, not of the number of native regiments, but of the strength of each of them. It would always be possible, they say, in tho event of war, to bring up the regiments to their full complement. Now, to what extent it is possible to raise the number of European soldiers in India, now under 50,000, or how it may also be possible to reduce the native. army, may be a nice and difficult question. But the brief history of this lamentable outbreak shows the strength of a small European force, and the danger, as well as the weakness, of a large Indian one. The self-confidence naturally engendered among a large body of armed natives considerably underofficered has certainly contributed much to disaffection and mutiny. Other causes may also have had their share. There may be too great a distance between the native soldier and the :British officer. The latter may have allowed the native officer to overstep his rank. There may have been a criminal neglect of the native superstitions. These causes may have hastened, aggravated, and excused the outbreak. But at the bottom of the whole is the sense of subjection, and the reliance on numbers to shake it off. This feeling will exist under the best management, and survive when policy has done its best. We must therefore always be on our guard against it, and take care to keep the balance of power in European hands.
There is one item of the public expenditure which we are never,disposedto criticize very harshly, and that is the sim of the Pensions charged upon the Civil Iist. The amount is limited to 1,2001. per annum-no very great sum if we consider the number of persons who are fairly entitled to relief from the public purse under this head. There are few people well acquainted with the secret history of London society who could not suggest additional names of persons which might be placed upon such a list without the chance of an objection from any quarter. We are not pleading the cause of literary men only, for by modern practice a place on this modest Pension List is not confined only to men of literary and scientific eminience, and to their helpless families, who may have fallen into distress in consequence of their death or sickness. This will appear by a mere recital of the names mentioned in the Parliamentary paper now before us. First, we take the names of those persons who are to receive 1001. per annum or upwards. The three pensions of this class which are first named are, no doubt, granted respectively in consideration. of literary and scientific melit. Mrs. MBA.Y A:rE A'BEcx=, ths widow of the late GiLBERT A'BEcxnr, is to receive a pension in consideration of her husband's literary merits, but furthermore foi his " eminent public services" as a metropolitan police magistrate. A more intelligent or useful magistrate never sat in a police-court than Mr. A'BwxrT, and the pension to his widow was fairly earned. The next pension of 1001. a-year is granted on purely literary grounds to Mr. PnuaP J.Ams BAILEY; and the third, exclusively for scientific services, to Dr. WIuiaArK PuLmNEY AImsoY, late Profeasor of the Practice of Physic in the University of Edinburgh. When literature and sience have thus received their pittance, law or diplomacy putE in a claim. 3mrs. JAtn MARGAnn BAcKHovsE i5 to receiye 1001. a-year. This Lady, as it appears, is unfortunately in great distres. Her husband, Mfr. GEORGE CA&NrXG BAOU1SEu, was murdered while in the discharge of his duties as CommissaryJudge at the Havannah. The next two pensions are for military services, and we are very confident we but express the universal feeling of the country when we say, that had it been possible to fix them at any reasonable multiple of the amounts named, not one dissenting voice would have been heard. Mrs. Amn-E ThoMPsoN, the mother of that gallant youth who died of the wounds he had received during the siege of Kars, has been left-we grieve to read itin straitened circumstances. This lady has most rightly been placed upon the list for a pension of 1501. per annum ;-we can only regret that the amount is not greater. Then Miss AN CATHCART, the daughter of the late Lieutenant-General Sir GEORGE CATHcART, who was killed at the Battle of Inkermann, is to receive 1007. a-year. The family of this brave officer have been left by his death in a very destitute condition, and we rejoice to see that it has been possible to make even this slender provision for one of the number. The name of Mrs. MARY PHiTkDELPHIA MERnrP=ra is the last upon the list of higher pensions. It is placed there in consideration of the " valuable services she h%s rendered to literature "and art, and the reduced circumstances in which "she is placed." Other names of higher eminence follow, but for smaller amouDts. We have from time to time brought before the public the lamentable history of the ConT family. HERY CoRT, during the days of the war with Revolutionary France, by the important and ingenious discoveries he made in the manufacture and treatment of iron, bore no mean part in the decision of that memorable contest, and added infinitely to the national wealth. Grateful England rewards his son in his destitution and old age with a pension of 501. per annum for the few years of life which may yet lie before him ! Dr. GAvn;, it may be remembered, was accidentally killed in the Crimea while engaged in the public service. A sum of 501. a-year has been granted to his widow, who has been left in great distress. The two Misses RAY are to receive between them a small annual allowance of 501. a-year, " in consideration of "the long and faithful services of their father in "the Admiralty Department r" These poor ladies are, it appears, in straitenea circumstances, and we do not wish to say one word against the modicumnof relief whickhaobeendoled out-to them. It is, however, a strange illustration of the value of the CiviLService Superannuation system, concerning which so much has lately been said, that the children of a valuable and long-triedCivilservant can be left in such aposition an torequie assistance from the public bounty. The mother of the late Lieutenant WAGHoRx, who had so, great a share in the eutablishrnent of the Overland Route to India, is also on the list for 501. a-year-a small reward for services eminently useful. The other two names which we shall next mention require no comment; every one will rejoice that even this slender provision has been made for the widows of two such men as the late HUGEn MrILER, the Scotch geologist, and MIr. JosxPE AYDwN. Mrs. MILERL is to receive 701. per annum, and Mrs. HAYDN an additional pension of 251. When we add that M£iss DoYLE, the sister of the late Sir Jomn' Mi:Lx Dons, has been placed upon the list for 501. a-year; MIr. CHARLES SwAUN, in " consideration of his literary merits," for the like sum; 31r. AL&xAERn MAcr6&w, on the same grounds, for 501. annually ., and Dr. CHAULES RioHAuDSOx, also on the sana grounds, for an additional 251. annually, we -wae literaly exhausted the list. Now, it would be ungracious a&n improper to inquire very critically if every lenny of this small sum has been bestowed in anx.kiembl unobjectiou- able manner, and if in every instance the mnost worthy name has been preferred. There must ba considerable difficulty in selection, for the eases are not presented before the Minister at the same time in one list, so that he can say, " This elaim is the superior one," or " That claim mysy be "postponed." From time to time a case of great datress is brought before his noticer-he is awara that the father or husband of the petitioner has great claims upon the public gratitude, or it may be that the petitioner himself, who is a person of some eminence in one department or other of knowledge, is in sickness or distreas. After some natural hesitation he grants one tithe of the relief which his feeling would prompt him to grant if his hands were untied, and there were sufficient funds at his disposal; and possibly next month a case of still soverer distress, connected with a name yet more eminent, is brought before him. The Pensions in the present list are granted during a period extending from the 23d of September, 1856, to the 19th of June in the present year. We can scarcely say that it would be right to apply the stern rules of ordinary business to such a matter. No doubt a suggestion could easily be made which would enable the Minister to decide more absolutely upon the grounds of the superior claim, but we cannot heartily recommend such a courae. We should be glad if the widows and families of those persons who have distinguished themselves in war, in diplomacy, or in administration, could be provided for from some other fund, for certainly the sum of 1,200L. a- year is no great amount for such a country as England to expend upon. the relief of science and literature in distress. Such relief must not, of course, be overdone, nor should a premium be placed upon the improvidence of literary and scientific men any more than npon the improvidence of any other class. We must not, however, forget that such men do absolutely render service to the country of a kind which is not rendered by any other class, and the emoluments they receive are not always in accordance with their merits, no matter how good their conduct, or how perfect their self-denial, may have been.
Certainly knowledge is increased in our days. We shall probably in the next year or two learn more of the Celestial Empire and its inhabitants than ha been told by aU the travellers of Europe from the first timid adventurers who brought home tales of distant Cathay to the missionaries and consuls of our own time. A very pretty sketch of modem Chinese civilization is given in the "Further Papers relating to the Proceedinga of "Hl H 31&imsTs Naval Forces at Canton." - From these it wi be seen what is the nature of the instruction by which men attain to offics in that classic land of examinations and- promotion by merit, and also how far they. are endowed with that peaceable. spirit and that calm discriminating justice with which the imagination of a party at home has invested them. On the 4th of April Commodore the Ron. C. J. ELLIOT captured some junks on the. San-on coast, opposite Hongkong. In one of these was discovered a correspondence, which has been faithfully translated, and is now laid before the Britiah public. It is the correspondence of CHAw-TzE-T, the younger brother of CHAN-KWEI-TSIR, President or Chief of the Committee of Hostility in San-on. The latter, we are told, is a graduate of the degree of Doctor; while CaAw-TZE-TI is " a graduate "and the pupil of Su-Trm-KwzI, a member of "the Han Lin College, one of the most important "of the Canton gentry, and apparently the channel "of communication between these brothers andthe "Governor-General Ymas.". . It would. apparthat to CHAi-TZx-Tm, the younger of these brothers, was committed the prosecution of an irregular war against us, and, indeed, against All Europeans whatever. The graduate posted his men with some skill. He distributed his pickets so as to pr.- vent any communication between Cooloon, a town on the peninsula, opposite Hlongkong, and Sar-on, which is situate on the Canton river, near the mouth. But the Committee of Hostility did not confine itself to defensive measures. "The cor"respondence establishes beyond doubt that the "San-on Committee, under authority and, in some "c aes, at the dictation of the Canton Central £ Committee, have been parties to almost every "atrocity" by which the English have been attacked or threatened. To this Committee, acting under the Sanction and, perhaps, under the order of the Governor YES, may be traced, if not the great junk attack which was in preparation, at least plots for more than one minor expedition, and for the destruction of Victoria by fire and its inhabitants by poison. But their great achievement has been their patronage of individual assassination. Mlost of the correspondence of CQHA1-TZE-rn refers to the various schemes for cutting off English stragglers, or of rewarding the successful "braves' who might have obtained the head of a foreign " devil." Evidently, the long inaction of the Britisht forces has inspired YaH and his subordinates with the highest confidence in themselves. Of late the Committees have ceased their active operations against us, and this is supposed to result from an expectation that, being perfectly exhausted, we are about to treat for peace. But at the beginning of the present year the San-on gentry were in full activity. On the 21st of January the younger brother writes to the elder, that "the barbarians are in very great perplexity, "that a proclamation is issued every day, and "three sets of regulations come out in two days. -' . . . . A flour bakery had poisoned several English devils, and been closed; upwards of 40 "people imprisoned in consequence." Encouraged by these signs of calamity, CsrAs-rzn-TDr urged on his preparations, which he detail in the next letter. "The ten braves from Kin-ton have arrived," he writes to the President of the Commiittee of Hostility, " and the English barba"rians fire guns at intervals during the night to "keep up their spirits. . . . . In every "devil hong is stationed a guard of devil soIdiers; "at sunset they make ready their cannon with 'great care. . -. .. The pdlice devils (or 'green-coated devils) in bands of 18 patrol, "and when they come to a dangerous place "they form up into large bodies. and fir before they -venture to proceed." Ee heri, after some other matters, relates how the i' braves" had ieized a man' " named Wowo-rA-r "s xusx, dreised in devil-clothes and boots, with " a devil fowling-piece in his hand, and spealing "the devil language fluently.". This person, on protesting he was not a "traitorous Chinese-," was held to bail. In a fewc days the Committee is quite ready to act. CRANTZE-TLX reports not only tlat the English are fightened, but that the American devil, seeing how things stand, had gone off. The ystem of this Celestial guerilla was to seize any Euglishmen or Anglo-Chinese he could find, and make each party believe they had been betrayed and murdered by the other. "I have this day enlistea "ten braves," he writes, " without the knowledge "of any man, and to-morrow sha get a boat "for the undertaking." What follows 'i3 I of particular importance :-" The other body Sf !men who are to be put on rations whie "the attempt shall have succeeded, are people "of the place (Hongkong or Cooloon3 . "Y0.,tdaV," he continues, " our braves a4zzd.

This church, however, Is quite unfitted for our ordinary national ritual, for which, indeed, it was not intended. It is internay and externaly of the common cathedral type, and its imposing effect is obtained by a magnitude considerably beyond that whioh would be convenient for any service in which tho sermon is the chief point. Thera is no romarkabls orlginality in this church; it is merely remarkable as, upoun the whole, the best restoration of medieval -church arcbitecture in the metropolis. The other church -we spoke of hss a far hi4her merit. It is a truly original .work. Without exoeeding or even- nearly reaching the 1ntertordinidnsions allowablein amodern Protestant church, and without any sacrifice of true eceesiastical effect, the imuilder of this church has succeeded in giving it a try rban size and effect by a rnost artistic amalgamation of the ,Varsonage and school-house with the church Itself, of which the'aingularv bat beautiful spire rlses to the altitude of 22a .-eet abovetLte pavement.

! SECOND EDITION. THE TIMESOFFICE, Thursdajy Horning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris corry. spondent, dated yesterday (Wednesday), 6 p.m.:- Public opinion seems now pretty well fixed on one point, namely, that the elections have been Unfavourable to the Government. It may be true in the abstract that the five electoral colleges of Paris which have returned Opposition members, without speaking of the two or three others in the depart. meats, are but a small minority, and do not outweigh the immense majority in the provinces; but it is also true that to Paris, the centre of the system which has so long prevailed in France, an immense, though au undue, imp)rtance has been always attached. The nomiination of General Cavaigtuac is regarded as really formidable, inasmuch as it re-e3tablishes at the head of the Democratic party a respected chief, who has rendered great services to France, and which, in spite of appearances, France has not forgotten. We have, in point of fact, a chief ot the Republic face to face with the chief of the Empire. The question now is, could such a result have been avoided ? The friends of the Goveiament can hardly dispute it without avowing that the Impecial r6gimne is destined to retreat before the Republic. In this difficulty they are forced to allegethat to the want of capacityor to-theexcesses of its own agents the serious check sustained by the Government is attributable, and that the Prefects have not been under firm and consistent direction. I he conduct of those functionaries generally has been aggressive and iritating, and the cities have 1 rotested against it by their votes. In Paris the Prefect of the Seine and the Prefect of Police have had little or no relation with the enlightened classes of the population, and theirintercoursewiththemhas been almost exclusively through the channel of their sgents, who were coldly received, and almost entirely disregarded. The action of the Government functionaries has been efficacious on the rural masses, but powerless on the superior classes, who, rightly or wrongly, believe that the former hold their places less for the public good than for the advancement of their own interests. They have shown their discontent by their votes-the only means now left them of passing judgment on the conduct of the Government. The Ministers to whom the public voice ascribes this result would explain it differently. They have, I seems, discovered that mfiversal svfrago is a vicious in'stitution, end a dangerous zstrument of Government; and, perhaps, they contemplate modification. It is said that the Inspectors-General of Gendarmery, before setting out on their usual topr of inspection, have-been requested to examine into the best means of arriving at such a modification, and also whether it would be r-ceived with favour in the provinces; and it is believed that it is intended to induce the Leglslative Corps to make a spontaneous and formal declaration that snch mzodifioation has become absolately necessary for the public safety. That universal suffrage is not the best means of placing the liberty of a people on a sure basis is admitted; but it may be doubted whether, in the present instance, t is exclusively in fault. This is not the first time that an institution has been made the scapegoat for the faultsof a Government. The same language wa; held by the ultra-Royalista, who persuaded CharlesX. that the liberty of the press was also a dangerous instrument, that the Chamber 'of'Deputies was nothing more than a factious assemblage, and that the gati6nal. Guard a's-the -nurx&7 of rebelie They forgot that if the press, the Deputies, and the National Guard had but little sympathy for the Government, itwasbecause the Governmentdid nothing to deserve that sympathy or to preserve it. The Minister of the Interior may charge universal suffrage after what has just occurred, but he forgets that the conduct of certain functionarles is one great cause, perhaps the greatest, of the facility with which the Republicau candidates have obtained suprort and votes [in the commercial and Conservative quarters of Paris. I doubt whether the opinions of some of his advisers on this point are shared by the Emperor. He is certainly surprised and pained at the result of the elections of Paris, and of some of the leading 'ities; but he does not believe that a bad feeling has arisen between himself and the nation at large. He believes, on the contrary, that between him andthe masses there are many points of contact and affinity, and he has stiU means at his disposal of preventing the effect from the moment he is made acquainted with the cause. The popularity of the Emperor may in some degree be weakened by the imprudent conduct of those under him, but it is still great. It is an edifice in which the faults of high functionaries may have caused breaches; it has not yet been seriously. damaged, but the sooner these breaches are repaired the better. I alluded yesterday to the question of the new deputies taking the oaths to the Constitution. I am again assured that, unless something unexpected occurs, they wiR do so; but they will refuse to attend for that purpose at the Palace of the Tuileries, where the Chambers are to be opened, on the ground that the Constituition imposes no such additional obligation. They will take the oaths to the Constitution in their legal place of meeting-the Palace of the Legislative Corps. The verification of powers will, in all likelihood, bo of as strong a character as is consistent with such an assembly. Many of the elections have been irregular in the extreme; in the department of the RhOne, for instance, it is affirmed that in ces Lain communes there were actually more votes than registered electors, and in others the whole of the registered electors are counted as having voted, though it is alleged that at least half of them abstained altogether from taking part in the ballot. On the whole, the impression on the public mind is far from favourable; men who desire order and stability are far from being at ease, and the Democratic party does not conceal its exultation. The moment for giving wamings to the Bstafette and the Assemrblee Nationale was il chosen. The Minister of the Interior, who was tolerant towards the Si6cle when it extracted, for the edificationi of the mames who read its pages, passages from the published works of Napoleon III., in order to show the contradiction between the sentiments of the writer and those of the Sovereign, seems to believe that Orleanismn is more dangerous to the Empire than Republicanism. The penalty inflicted on these Journals seems to prove the existence of a personal feeling rather than anything else, and the public generally regard it as an act of private vengeance rather than of firmness. The Assemrnle Nationale, to which I have just alluded, has been suspended for two months, by order of the Minister of the Interior, and the Commissary of Police who was the bearer of the order was charged with seeing to its immediate execution. The consequence is, that the Assemblee, which was already printed, could not be distributed to the public, and its manager had no other resource than I io inform its subscribers of the fact by means of a circular. That harsh and unjust measure is for an article publishod in its number of yesterday (7th), entitled " UTn Demnier Mot sutr les lections," signed "L;etellien?~, in which it is said |" It is diffilcult to perceive in the elections which have just taWmplace one of those free and spontaneoas manifes tatio;tLo.o &blirn opinion which do not allow even the most incredulous any meaas of doubting the union of the c,'untry and of its Government. It is convenient, when an a,npeal is made to the nation, to make at the same time the dema d and the reply; but such reply should not be invoked as A striking testimony of public opinion. The raral commnonS have had, it is true, a great part in the general result of the elections, but they have voted under the action of adminis. trative influeaces, and these influences should be taken into account when it is sought to place against the opposition and tl e abstention which are remrrked in the towns the ea'erness and the lidelity of the rural electors." On the abot e extract the article in the Mtonieur "Considering that these allegations, whatever mnsy be the skiU of the language in which they are put forth in the arUcle in question, are at the same tihe false and malevolent, that the fuUest liberty has presided over the electoral trugzle, and that the Government caunot -with impunity allow to be calumniated the five millions of votes which on all points of the territory, both intown and country, gaveit heir loyal support, decrees that the AsscnltUe Nationale is suspended for two months from the 8th of July." The second decree says:- " Considering the article in the number of the Estaf e, of the 7th instant, under the title of ' Brlletu du Jour,' signed 'Dumont,' coatainingthefollow!u paragraphs:-' In spite of the ass&rtions of certain journa1s, we maintain what vwe have already said on the subject of the significatlon of the vote of Paris. Yes, tbe capital is the political expres. ion of the whole of France, because Its inhabitants are composed of citizens from all theother centres of population. Yes, thevoteof the 22d of June,thanominationsof MM. Goudchauxand,Carnot,andtherelative m,jority obtained by General Cavaignso,have abearing which has been apprewited by all the European press';-oonsidering that under the r6gsme of universal suffrage therespect due to the authority of the majority is a fundamental principle which the minorities cannot be allowed to deny or to call in question; considering that to pretend-to find-theopolitical expristo6 btt'hFiiEo-r of France in the vote of some colleges, when the whole of it has clearly expressed its opinion, Is to attack the constitu. ti nal authority of the 5,000,000 of suffrages which form the inmmense majority obtained by the Government candidates, decrees that a second warniRg is given to the Estafet8e In the person of IL Domont, the g6rant of the journal, and the signer of the article." It is admitted that the Minister of the Iahtdro is not generally in the habit of insulting those wlom he pUnishes. If he had taken time for reflection he would have seen that he might have avoided constituting himself judge in his own cause. The Assem1bld Natwnale did not, in the article v hich has drawn on it this burst of Ministerial wrath, attack either the principle, or the polcy, or the acb of the Government en masse. It confined itself to certain comments on the elections, tending to show that the liberty accorded to the electors was not the same throughout; and that in the rural districts particularly a hundred peasants or so, voting together under the scrutinizing eye of the mayor, the deputy-mayor, the cur6, and the taxgather, dc., while the garde-champr s- and the schoolmaster were employed in hunting out the tardy or forcing the indifferent to appear, could hardly be considered as completely free. The elections, we all . know, belong to the department of the Minister of the. Interior, consequently it is that department which is the plaiutiff. The most ordinary notions of equity are agsainst his assuming to decide on the character of assertions which were undeniably put forth In a very moderate form. Beyond this assumed jurisdiction of a Ministerial department there is the authority of the tribansls, and it is before these that M. Billault, as a lawyer and member of the Govern-. ment, should have defended the impartiality and honour of his administration. This appeal to jus. tice would have been more dignified than the rigorous measure he has adopted. In discusning the electoral question - the AssembMe has, by Its reference to recent events, brought M. Billault himself into court. It reminded its readers that K. de Montalembert, whose re-election has been just combated with vigour and with succe3s by order of the inister, had more than once, In bh placein the Constituent Afsenbly, defende(tagainit M. BiUault the government of the President of the Republic, which was then feeble and tottering. In its last article, when alluding to the voting in the communes, it mentioned that M. Billault had been, as the reporter on the electoral law, the firmest and most persevering adversary of that mode of voting, which was also supported by the same MX de Montalembert, now its most distinguished victim. By punishing the Assem-blie Nationale M. Billault has made himself a judge in his own cause, and rendered himself liable to the suspicion of being the avenger of a criticism on himself. Be this as it may, the order of suspension has already been put into execution. The Assem1bl,e has announced that its conductors have not yet decided how they will act in-the meantirne towards Its subscribers, but it ls certain that It will again appear on the 8th of September, after a forced silence of two months. The Journal de Maie est Loire publishes the foL lowing result of the election which has taken placa in the circumscription of Angers :-M. E. Duboys, the candidate of the Government, obtained 11,533 votes; IM. G. Bordillon, 10,267. The majority in favour of M. Duboys is 1,271. He is consequently elected. The Univers announces that in the Mayenne 1M. Haligon, the Opposition candidate, has been elected over M. Segretain. In the Somme M. de Morgan, the Opposition candidate, polled 14,264 votes; IM. de I4marre, 10,895. M, de Morgan is consequently elected a deputy of the Somme. The Pays, Mllinisterial journal, contradicts the report in the Italian papers that the late insurrection was to have extended to the Roman States, and that the Pope had for that reason quitted his capitaL The Palys adds that no trace of an insurrection has been discovered at Rome, where the mos' perfect tranquillity has never ceased to prevail, nor was any part of the Roman States menaced. According to the plan of the chiefs of the insurrection,the revolt was not to extend to that part of Italy, and all the efforts of the conspirators were to be directed elsewhere. The English fleet, under the command of Admial Lord Lyons, arrived in the roads of Leghorn from Cagliari on the 26th June. The Admiral was to tal on the 4th or 5th inst. for La Spezia, and probably thence to Toulon.

Yesterday the Chamber of Depaties.yirtually terminated the labours ofliai seiion wWth tMe estimates for the. revenue for :1858, which were fixed at 136,000,000E., and adopted at that mun by a man jority of 98 votes agaiist 10. The principal question raised in thi3sdiscugsipn bn the generAlreveife *as tliat 'o the excise duties, and Siguor Moia' proposed the abolition of these duties,: and wished to engage the Government to present a bill for an income or property tax In their stead. Ia order to understand precisely the value of ;this proposition it is necessary to premise that, previous to 1850, the excise' dutids were only partially applied, some provinces of the kingdom baing altogethei 4xempt from them, and among these were 'the Ligurian provinces. In 1850, in consequence of the iucreased demand: oa the public treasury, caused by the expenses of the war.of the two previou5 years, as well as by the indemnity secured to Austria at the peace, and in accordance with the system of substituting more direct for indirect taxation as introduced by Count Cavour, these duties were applied to the whole kingdom. At the outset they encountered the usual fate of all new taxes-unpopularity and ignorant impatience-and,' unfortunately, simultaneously with their general application came the grape disease, which lastd in aome districts until 1855, and in others is not yet extinct. he loss of the wine crop3, of course, entailed a dezreascd consumption aud an increased value to this article, which made the excise duties faU all the heavier en consumers, pd4suote consumers de- clared they had become insupportable,whileoothers, .1 where they had been newly i riposed refused 'dtogetber to pay them, and their Com uercial Councils resigned in consequence. The city of Genoa was a-nong the latter, and there the, Government haa been obliged to name a Royal commissioner to ad. minister the affairs of the municipality pending the arrangement of. the subject. Unxder these circumstaices, then, theproposalof SignorMoiawaslikely enough to obtain a good deal of urnreflecting popularity throughout the country, but within the walls of the House a veV atrong doubt seems to have been entertained whether the meansproposed by the hon. member would suffice to fill up the gap in the revenue caused by the suppression of the excise duties. Count Cavour vigorousy opposed the motion of M&n& id thatthe sme -kin oftaxes out leeing anpopular, and in the latter country they produced & sum of 10,000,0001. sterling per annum. It was a tax, he said, on the taverns for a consump. tion little recommendable, for certainly half of those who frequent the taverns would be better away. He thought the unpopularity of the tax would disappear with the habit of paying It and the removal of the grape disease. It would be impossible to discuss so serious a question as that of an income tax at the end of the session, but he would be quite pre pared to entertain it at the commencement of the nextsession. eWsaid:- "1 I do not wlsh to avoid the discussion, on the contrary, I shall be glad to have all possible light thrown on the subject bat at present I am fat from convinced of the possibility of applying this tax. In England, where the economic system is much more adapted than ours for an income-tax, it was found to be intolerable, and at the peace it was the first tax to be removed In preference to that of the Excise. lore. over, how will it be possible to impose an Income-tax concurrently with those other direct taxes on persons, chattels, patents, lands, and houses' It would 'be necessry to abolish all these, and raise 47,000,000f. by income-tax. In En;gland, duming the war, the income-tax was raised to 10 per cent., but there It stopped, wad the tax produced 400000,000f. Now, I have a very good opinion of the capabilities of my own country, but I do not think it can yield in this way in the proportion of 47 to 4co, as compared with England. It would probably be necessary therefor, to raise the tax to 15 or 16 percent., and I think that the Deputy Mola, bold ts he Is, would hesitate before doing so. Besides, we have want of credit more than ever at this moment, and to put a tax of 10 or 12 per cent. on income would be just the way to ruin it." Signor Moia's proposition was ultimately rejected, but the Chamber, recognizing the exceptional condition of certain provinces, modified the rating according to which they had been burdened, and reduced the contributions from the city of Genoa, for.instance, by 100,000f., and those from the commune of Genoa by 80,000f. Those of JBobbio are reduced 140,000f., and a further sum of 150,000f. has been taken off, which is to be divided among several small communes that have not been able to pay their contributions in the past years. At the end of the sitting, Signor Tecchio invited the Minister of the Interior to publish a statement in the official paper, showing how long those persons (not Sardinian subjects born) had been in the Sardinian States who were arrested at Genoa the other day on a charge of conspiracy and high treason, and whether they were possessed of proper passports,aud if so, from what Government such passports were obtained. To this request the Minister of the 1n tenor readily acceded. The preparations for the Crown prosecution of the prisoners at Genoa are said to be progressing rapidly. under the direction of the Government Firsca, and a few. more persons have been arrested on suspicjoXi of having been more or less active pa#ticipators ini the' plot. Further discoveries of arnsu act ammunition continue tbe enade by the police,and the indignation. of both military and civilans against theo'?aiinians is aid to be very great,on' findinD large stor'es of' minng and gunpowder, ahid shelli anid. >etards, and''a2 manner of explosive contrivances for the regeneration of Italy, deposited without any especial care. except that of concealingt'he fact, within a few yards or feet of where they were unconsciously lodged. A large quantity of powder was discovered the other night in a drain under the barracks of San Ambrogio, close by the Dlucal Palace, which would have been sufficient to destroy the whole of that populous neighbourhood if ignited from any cause, so that it is easy to understand the feelings of the ,people living thereabouts on discovering the risk to which they had been so mischievonsly exosed. Calm has been undisturbed at Genc, iin' e the evening of the 30th; and at Leghor no furthter atrocities have been reportcd on ai1taer side since the Ist. By the by, I fear I made a mistake in quoting a letter from Leghorn yesterday, by putting "a.m.," instead of " p.m." where the writer speaks of the commencement of tlie eci.teak there on the 30th, and if so, the fault is altogether mine, for I misunderstood the dates at the time of reading the letter, and I see now that "p.m." must have been intended, though there iv no such definition in the original. SPAIN. (rox orlr OWN CoRnESPoXriIT.) MADRID, JuLY4. In both Chambers the debates yesterday were long and important. In the Senate the discussion was on the project of law for the recruitment of the a my. The speakers were almost exclusivoly gene. ra1s:-O'Donnell, Concha, Serrano, Rivero, the Minister of War, ande the President of the Council. To disarm his opposentm, General Narvass declared that the country was in, danger. He said,- "General O'Donnell eoncluded MIs 1p6,gby sying th it is necessary to h4ve a good rsy to kteep down tbe RWpnblican revolutionists and the COU,: well,' then, both exist They have already bepu tbhir work-already bands have risen in Despenaperrcsr'and have been routed, others iL Andalusia, and of tbh ; I hope toxmrrow to ba able to ssy the. same. At Teruel; at Malaga, and at other places in Spain thero have been attempta- atreoUllor. The Government knows that there exista a secret soiety wich ihinks it hss means to disturb the public tranquillity, but the conspirators miserably deceive themselves; they will not accomplish their daring intention of lihtiagngp4ivA war General Concha took the Government severely to task, raying, amoDg other sharp things, that if the Ministry, as it said, did not fear revolations, why. cid it come und talk about them. -He and Genef Serrano both declared ho6ever, that, shoujd -a evolution break out, the Government they now ?ppose -vold- find thenMat -its ict, rea support it against anarchy. . The admissions made by General larvaez have not, as may be supposed, lessened the feeling of uneasiness that prevails out of doors. The discussion in the Senate, animated though it was, was tame compared to that in the Lower Chamber. The order of the day was the report of the committee on the authorization demanded by Government to put in force the law relating to the press. The Opposition; made the most of the slender opportunity of discussion left to them by Ministerial manceuvres, and by violations of the regulations of the Cougaeis. Four amendments were discussed, and either rejected or withdrawn. The speech of the day was that of Colonel Verdugo, a new deputy, unused to Parliamentary debates, and who, while telling many bitter truths to the Government, was certainly at times unparliamentary in his expressions. He unsparingly criticized the absurdities of the law, and especially a paragraph of the 26th article of the Sd chapter, by which, "journalists whose writings may tend to lower the fidelity or discipline of the army in any way not foreteen by ahemilitary laws are liabletobe tried by court-martial." The project of law is so clamsily drawn up that it is fu,l of contradictions and offences against common sense. Senor Verdugo,. with great fire and a iort of "unadorned eloquence," that had a telling effect, strippcd some of these absurdities to the skin, plainly showing that such a law vould have no chance of passing in a Chamber composed of rational men,, not re3o1ved beforehand to support its projectors at all events. He proceeded with much vehemence, amidst the murmurs of the Ministerial majority, until he spoke of " this odious project, in which he saw the dcath of the Constitution'l system, inflicted in a cowardly and hypocritical manner by means of shameful mutilations." Here Senor Pidal interrupted, demanding decorum in the discussion, and declaring that such expressions had never been heard in that place. This was tbe beginning of a scene worthy of the bp~llring. The President, Martinez de la Rosa, *-~ls,o, throughout this asession, has too frequently shown himself subservient to the Government, an forgstful of the impartiality befitting his high office,-threatened to imakeVerdugo sit doni; Pidal addressedhimself to Verdugo in his usual overbear ing tone, saying something about cowardice,.but was interrupted or rather drow3ied, by the noise. Marfori, the Governor of Madrid, and prot6g' of Narvaez, intemperately addressed the orator, declaring that hei 6qdht in no asnuer to be allowea to speak. There wa3 treiiendouA jgjta&tjoIl in .the Chamber; order was at length in some degree restored, and Verdugo continued his speech, when ho was again interrupted by Garcia Hidalgo, who cried out that he was mad. It is unnecsssary to trouble you with details of the whole scene, thanwhich a more discreditable one has rarely been witnessed in a legislative assembly. Again and ag'ain Verdugo was interrupted, and the intervention of the President rendered neessary ; the majority literally roared at him, uttering cries of " Fuera! Puera" ' such as are addressed to bad bulls in the arena. Verdugo displayed great pluck, biit'naturally the treatment to which he was subjected did not tend much to calm his excitement or moderate his languagve. Senor Nocedal, the youthful and virtuous Einister of the Interior, as the Iberia, greatly to his exasperation, invariably calls him, replied, and said, among other astonishing things, that public opinion, which Senor Verdugo had stated to be opposed to the law, was represented solely In the Senate and the Congress, and that the decision of the Chambers alone showed what public opinion was. Under another system, and with freedom of election, this might be tre; as it is, I need hardly say thatit is completely false. An unusual and remarkable demonstration was made yesterday by the Madrid press with respect to Senor Nocedal. Each time that he rose to speak (and yesterday he was repeatedly on his legs), the reporters, editors, &c., who were very numerous on the occasion of so interesting a debate, walked out of the gallery allotted to t'em, and returned only whenthe Ministerof the Interior sat down. On one of these occasions, two persons, known to nobody, having remained in the gallery, one of the doorkeepers was sent in to them to demand their tickets of admission. They had none, and wore compelled to leave. It was supposed they were police agents. The speeches of Senor Nocedal are not the less reported in the papers to-day, it being customary for the official Gerette to furnish all the other journals with an abridged and expurgated version of the debates; but they are omitted in the summaay. It is expected that this project of law will be discussed to-day in its totality, and will passtheChamber, and that the sittings of the Cortes will be suspended without delay. The newspapers give details of the disturbances in the provinces. Some of these may be exaggerated, but the truth suffices to inspire uneasinees. The town of Utrera, in Andalusia, a place of 12,000 iahabitants, has been entered by an insurgent force, vrrying in strength, according to different accounts, from 100 to 200 men. The town had no military garrison; some carabineros,-Custom-house guards, -who were there, took to flight, with their officer, one Paniagua; a handful of gendarmes defended themselves) in their barrack until it was set on fire; the insurgents, who all had firearms of one sort or other, some of these being quite new, burned the archives of thel Ayuntamiento, seized arms and horses, and levied on the town a contrihbution of 6,;iO dollars, which they took awa with them. About 100 of the in- habitants of lUtrera accompanied' thien when they departed, but jomne of these, -*ith- the proverbiall fid;leness of. Andalusians, had already returned at the date of the last' advices. l'iaciy of the insiirge'nts proceded fromn Seville'; their de- vic4 was Repiublican. They 'vere ebhiefy artisans.' Tioops Ihave been sent in their pinst. The-pro- vinZe of Seville has been proclaimed in X state of siege. 'A iewispaer speaks of a sligh attemped distdrbance at 'Logro'io. Such repoit, more or, less 'founded, arrive from all patts. It :s said, with much appearance of trutb, that these insurretonary movements have been fomented, if not altogether got up, bv the Spanish Democrats now refugees in Portugal. The Government is likely to take extraordinary measures, and perhaps the whole country, or a considerable portion of it, may be delared under martial law. Royal decrees in to-day's Gzette remove General Azlor y O'Neil, Director-General of Cavalry, to the a'ptain-Generalcy of Estremadura, and General Alcala Galiano, from Estnimaelnra, to the General Directorship of Cavalry. The cause of this change is not known, but it is not supposed to be of a political nature. General aliano commnded the cavaley of Don Carlos, in the province of Alava, during the civil war. Many Carlists are now to ba found in high positions in the army. There is a probability that the Mexican affasr may come tD rome Eort of head within four or five days, although this ha-, been so often announczi that one Ecarcely dares believe it. Despatch^s rid Southanipton are exp ct-d here on the Gtlh or 7th inst. There are some hopeg of axn amicable adjustment. Senor Pidal, as I hefore said, is very disiiclined to hostilities. It apte ra not iniprobable that when the Cortes shall be cl eel, and the press gagged (two events now i imri. ent), the Spanish Government may show itself moxe lielding than it hitherto has done. If n6t, and if the 11exican. mail does nbt bring somethinag important, Senor lafragua's departure may Ehortty be expected. 6 o'Caocx. The discwssiononthelawof.thepTessw3sreu el to-day.

The debate on the totality of the law (the amendments having been got rid of) continnes at the time at which I write. Some oangry explanations have taken place, and a couple.of duels are on the tapis-bhtween Verdego and Garcia Hidalgo, who yesterd:y raid that ha was imad; aand betweea lVerdago and Brigadier Remna, who yesterday said thae only Wbd, Eoldiers (malos militaires) joined iv, insurieetiosu_ To-day Verd4ngo asked Reina, to explain what he maeant by the expression, and Reins said that be, meant soldiers or offlcers who turned their armsw against the Government.

No doubt is entertained that tihe authorizatioa of law demanded by. the Government wilT be votedc !V cor4&g to the latest account* from Andalusia, the' ients, after leaving VUtrera& had entere& several oter places, and had committed various excessesw burning and pillaging.

Their profession of political-faith is of. ademocrat-J' nature, including abolition of the conscription,, and. a general arming of the people. The Governmentprofesse itself confident of the speedy suppresaion of this and all other attempts at insurretion. Here I do not think there is anything to. be apprehended, although a high military authority to-day told a Colonel of the garrison that he expected am outbreak on MIonday, and to be on the alert. This, is probably founded merely on the fact that; Mfonday is bullfight day, when such tlungs are most apt to occur, when people come streaming out of the PLana at nightfal, and. the streets are. crowded.

TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIMES. Sir,-In the 3d volume of 27re Life of General Sir OF Napier, p. 403, he is represented to have thus written to} his brother:- "Major Powell's story about Outram and the village is true. I heard of it before." On which Sir W. Napier makes the following remark:- "This story was, that being sent with troops, regular and irregular, to quell a disturbance in a village, he had positive orders not to let the irregulars into the place, as there was a feud between them and the people. In defiance of this he did pat the irregulars in, and they murdered the vilagers and sacked the place." Sir James Outram being absent from the country, I trust. jouwill allow me, as I was present on the above occasion, and am fully acquainted with all the particulas, to contradict this story, whEic-h is as far from the truth as many other fables with which Sir William Napier has stuffed his The affair occurred 20years ago, as thus,-an insurrection. broke out in the territory of a native prince and was joined in by some of the people belonging to the province of which. Outram had political control. 'The times were wild, and. thers was every chance of the insurrection spreading. Theiesurgents established themselves in a stronghold on tho very border lie of Ontram's province, and began to plunder the country far and wide. The irregular troops of the Rajah were put in motion to. suppress the rebeiLion, and Oatram reported to his own, Government hsis intention of co-operating. After a time, receiving no orders, and finding natters vere procceeding t.. a crisis, le marched with a detachment of regulars to the. place and invested it. Offers had been previously made to. the insurgents that their just claims, if any, should hb attendea toeon their submission, and after the place was invested Outram forbade the native chief to storm the piscs. until another opDortunity had been given to the rebls to. surrender. A Charun (a religious herald) was sent into4le place with fair terms, and Outrani, taking the chief by t.ho. hand, obliged him to sit down in view of and tin. musket range of the place and await his return, in order to prevent any private order being give& to storm without his consent, and to give weight. to the mesasge of the Obarun. The insurgents firedimcessantly on Oatram and his party, but it was not till a considerable time had elapsed, and the Charun had retirneI and one of the personal servants of the native chief had been. woumded by their side, that Outram reluctantly aHiw*d the storning party to advance. After a. desperate reslstance, the place was carried, but, as it was beyond our own territory, the regular troops did not join in the storn. Ontram was not sent, he received no orders, pteitive orother, and could not, therefore, have defied any. His mnoving atalL was within his own discretion.

TlEB ITALIAN INSURBBCTION. (FROM OUR owrN CORREsPON'DENT-* TURIN, ~JULY 3. On the opening of the Charaber of Deputies today Count de Revel again addressed the Minister of the Interior on the subject of the arrests at Genoa, asking him if he would make known the names of the persons arrested, and the tendency of the latemovements. "The Session," said Count de :Revel, * Is on the pnint of closing: the tribunes will be mute f..r some months : it is the duty of the Uhamber therefore to provoke every explanation on the nature of that moveuent, onL the number and condition of the arrested." Signor Rattazzi, Minister of the Interior, replied:- " I regret that I have not brought with me the list of the arrested, or I would have read it, but I promise to have published in the official paper the numnber, the place of birth, and the condition of the persons arrested. As to the tendency of the movement, I repeat that it was committed in a Mazzinian sense. Few, however, were the persons 'who wittingly took part in it. The great mass of the population, and those subject to the Excise law, which has been the cause of much discontent at Genoa, were absolutely strangers to these movements. I can, moreover, assure the Deputy de Revel and the Chamber, that if the Government is determined to maintain the laws, it is likewise inexorably decided that justice shall have its course, and that the punishment which they deserve shall be inflicted on those who seek to disturb public tranquillity." There is little, in fact, to add to the reports already given of the Genoa affair until the judicial inquiry shall have elucidated more details. The mere publication of the names will not throw any light on the motives or instigators of the evildoers. It is known already that those who were actively engaged in these proceedings were persons of the lowest classes of society, some of them Genoese Fsome from other parts of Italy, and some foreigners. Among those arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting is the editor of the Italia del Popolo (Signor Mazzini's official paper), and it is reported that Signor Mazzini is himself somewhere in the meighbourhood; but it remains for the legal authorities to unravel the thread of the plot. What strikes every one to inquire is, where did these people get so much money for all these preparations ? The attempt on the Genoese forts was, after nl, it appears, only a small part of an extensive plan for setting the whole Peninsula in a blaze. It has been ascertained that a simultaneous attack had teen arranged to take place at different points in the West of Italy, and it is known now that an outbreak actually did occur at Leghorn and in the Neapolitan kingdom almost at the same moment as the Filibustering forces assaulted the sergeant's guard in the ])iamante Fort at Genoa. A very considerable quantity of arms and ammunition has been seized by the police at Genoa, and it is reported that a further supply was shipped on board a steamer called the Cagliari, -which sailed from Genoa for Sardinia and Tunis on the 25th of last month, and has not since been heard of The non-arrival of the Cagliari at her destination -within a reasonable time, and the ascertained fact that a number of young men had embarked on board of her for Tunis, had caused a suspicion that she was the steamer reported to have been captured by a Neapolitan frigate in the Gulf of Salerno ; but, on the other hand, it is said that another steamer Mvas to sail from Malta for the Neapolitan coast with a detachment of the " sect" about the same time, and that that is the steamer which has been taken. Whether it was the Cagliari or not that was taken is a matter of no consequence in the general argument; the fact which I wish to call your attention to is, that the Mazzinian party expected reinforcemnents of men, arms, and ammunition from another point, and this leads back to the original question,where did they get their funds from ? It is true they have evinced much prudence and foresight in not frittering away any part of their capital in chartering or insuring the steamers they were kind enough to employ in the noble cause of the regeneration of Italy, but they could hardly have succeeded in obtaining their arms and ammunition on the same liberal and patriotic terms ; and these, judging from the quantity already discovered, together with a hundred other incidental expenses necessarily requiring ready-money payments, must have involved an outlay for the present campaign far beyond what could be covered by any subscriptions that we have heard of lately either in Italy, England, or else-where. Signor Mazzini's principles (so to call them) for providing funds and provisions for his troops, when once they have taken possession of a country, are well known, but we have still to learn whence he derived the pecuniary means for this last expedition, and if it can be proved that he has done so honestly, from the contributions of the " friends of Italy," witbout any secret assistance from her enemies, he ought to be instantly engaged as llinister of Finance by the Emperor of Austria or the Pope, or some other embarrassed Sovereign, in consequence of his wonderful talents as a manager of public funds. According to the most recent advices from Lehorn and Maples, the movements of the insurgents had been as effectuaUy quelled there as at Genoa. From Naples our news is confined to the limits of a telegraphic despatch, and the details of the proceedings you wiU no doubt receive in London as soon as -we shall here; but from Leghorn aU accounts agree in representing the conduct of the Mazzinists as wantonly brutal. On the 30th they commenced by stabbing several soldiers as they walked singly through the streets. The next day the main guard of the town was attacked and a sentry killed, but the guard repeUed the assailants, and, having made some prisoners, shot them on the spot. About the same timo an attack was made on the Artillery Guard, with much the same results. A party of troops crossing one of the squares was fired upon from the windows of a house, which they immediately entered, and found ten persons within, of whom they bayonetted three where they stood, and, capturing the other seven, -they took them into the square and there shot them. Several other instances of unprovoked attacks on the soldiery by the Mazzinists and as prompt retaliation are recorded as having occurred that day, but the next day tranquillity was restored, and the Monitore !Poscano of the 1st inst. publishes despatches from the Governor and Commandant of Leghorn to M. Landucci, the Minister of the Interior, dated 0.45 a.m., July 1, which states that order was completely restored and tranquillity assured. " The fact is most deplorable," says the Govermor in his report, after recounting the events of the previous day; " But no serious consequence is to be apprehended, because the population did not join the rioters. It is known that three Gendarnies are dead and three wounded ; of the insurgents 13 are dead." " Here all is tranquil," writes the com3mandant:- " The population go about their business, and since 4-30 workmen may have been seen going to their work as usual. Of the wounded in hospital, one case only is serious." The Sardinian Senate voted the Bill for transferring the naval head-quarters to Spezzia yesterday by a majority of 42 votes against 22, notwithstanding the strenuous efforts of the Genoese Senators, who, with two exceptions, were hostile to the measure. The majority was even greater than the friends of the Ministry expected, and it is said to have been so in consequence of a feeling excited by the last affair at Genoa, because it is felt that such an inflammable place is not a fit harbour or the Royal Navy. JTULY 4. To day the official journal, in pursuance of the promise given by the Minister of the Interior yes- ter'day in the Chamber, publishes the following particulars regarding the persons arrested at Genoa. IJp to yesterday 52 persons had been arrested, of -vhom 32 are natives of the Sardinian States-that is to Bay, 23 of Genoa, 6 of Spezzia, 1 of Chiavari, 1 of Alessandria, 1 of Mortara; 19 natives of other Italian States-as 5 of Parma and Piacenza, 1 of Modena, 7 of the Lombardo Veneto, 6 of Romagna; an4 1 Frenchman. Of these 42 are workmen of different kinds, as tailors, shoemakers, porters, carpenters, and blacksmiths; two are students, two servants, one secretary, one shopman, two proprietors, and onejournalist. To the above list more wilt probably be added as the thread of the plot is unravelled, and to-day even I learn that a young lady, a British subject, has also been arrested and ordered to leave the SardiniAn States forthwith, to which she strenuously ob- jects, and protests that she will only dto brute force. The lady alluded to is a iss t, who is said to be well known in those political coteries in England of which Signor M/azzini is the great attraction. She cametothiscountrysome months sinoe, andwas received with acclamatons by the admirers of the Apostle of Revolution and Republicanism, s his most intimate frionds and as such sie recved marks of deference and respect from his followers both in Genoa and Turin. There are not many believers in Mazzini inthis town; nevertheless, when Miss WVhite visited the capital of the Sardinian kdngdom a month or two ago, a serenade was got up to compliment her by a society of so-called "tradesmen," and it was said that in returning thanks to these amateur musicians for their perseverance in blowing under her windows on a very rainy night she told them they would do much better, in her opinion, if they would go home and prepare themselves to fight for their liberty, &c In fact, whether rightly or wrongly, Miss White I has been regarded by all parties here as an agent of Mazzini and the Government, I believe, took the same viewv, but abstained from using its authority towards her so long as her residence was productive of no further mischief than some Republican speeches; but now it would appear that the Government has thought proper, in consequence of recent events at Genoa, to require this lady to quit its territory, and rshe appeals against what she, of course, calls their abominable tyranny, to the British Legation for protection. I have not heard what reply Sir James Hudson has given to this demand, but I should very much doubt his iaterfering to stay the decision of the Sardinian Government, alter studying the merits of Miss White's case. I gave you yesterday a summary of the account of the Leghorn disturbances, which I had received from a Sardinian authority. I now add some extracts from the letter of an English gentleman who has long been resident in Italy, and who, as you will perceive, was an eye-witness of these transactions "Leghorn, July 1, 9 a.m. "After a couplo of hours' rest at the inn yesterday morning, I strolled into the streets, and soon remarked a strange excitement among the publio. Without any apparent reason, some would run off as hard as they could in one direction, while others scampered off in another. On asking the reason of aU this I could get no answer, except that there were some apprehensions of a political movement being contemplated. One woman rushed into the shop where I was, with her child, and both were all but in hysterics, and yet she could give no reason for her alarm, and could do nothing hbt cry. The boys shrieked aud cried as they trundled their carte with chips. The men looked behind them and, without seeing anything, set off running as hard as they could with faces convulsed with fear. In short, one ot those panics had seized upon the public which I had hitherto fancied peculiar to 's countrymen-it was the 'Fui / Fui I' of the Lazzaroni, and in my whole- existence I have never seen so curious an exemplification of the Italian character. With all this there was a violent sirocoo, which seemed to parch you up. " After about two hours the troops began to move out of their barracks in considerable bodies, and marched about the streets, with apparently as little object as the people had in running and the carts and carriages in galloping. Then three guns (I conolude alarm guns) were fired from the Castle, and graduaUy, close at hand, there were repeated discharges of musketry in the streets. Then appeared artillery ready for action and surrounded by gunners armed with short carbines, which they kept pointing at the windows of the houses, and especially at my head, as I stood marvelling at the scene. At the headof the troops was Colonel Rousselot in a Field-officer's hat with pale green feathers, who kept shouting with a sort of monkey ferocity at the few astonished passers-by, and who was accompanied by an absurd Adjutant or BrigadeMajor, who occasionally charged the passers-by, and attempted to ride over or cut them down. Then a soldier would step out of the ranks and point his loaded gun, on fuU cock, at these poor wretches, and try a pot shot at them. At last, some dozen of them turned in one direction, and were with some difficulty prevented from firing in a volley. In the midst of this, three or four English officers (of Lord Lyons's squadron) walked up, and were advised by Colonel Rousselot to take ref ago in the hotel where I am staying, and these officers told me that Colonel Rousselot informed them that one officer had been shot dead and five or six soldiers wounded from the windows. " At about 10 I persuaded the porter to let me out of the house to post a letter, and succeeded in doing so under the escort of a soldier, given me by-the officer in command of the detachment under my window. This officer denied the shooting of the officer mentioned by Colonel Rousselot, but spoke of 'coUlellat' by which several Carabinieri had been killed. My own belief is, that the panio which seized the people had likewise extended to the authorities and troops. It makes one shudder to think that such tragi-comic scenes are still possible in the 19th century. " No one has yet given me a rational explanation of all this, but I am now going to see whether - can do so. The principal thoroughfares of the town were militarily occupied all night, just as they used to be at Paris in June, 1848. " This morning the streets are as fuU as usual, and there. is no symptom of the previous excitement, except that every five minutes a strong patrol passes by with an advanced guard, with their muskets on fall cock, ready to let fly at the first real or imaginary enemy. "A tremendous storm of thunder and lightning terminated this exhibition of paternal government, and sent the bulk of the troops home to their barracks, after some six or eight hours' resistance to an invisible, aud I believe imaginary, enemy. "W ednesday, July 1, 12 o'Clock.-Since the above was written I have been out and seen Mr. Macbean, the Consul, who does not appear to have a much clearer notion of whab is going on than I have. He, however, considers the movement to have been a real Mazzinian attempt, and consequently that the military measures wore to a certain extent justified. The Governor, AL BarzagAi has, I understand, promised to put an end to the brutal system of isolated firing and threatening which every one here witnessed. One man was shot while actuaUy talking to some of our officers. Altogether 12 men were. shot yesterday of the people, and five or six of the troops were killed or wounded. To-day they began again in the same way, b1azing about the streets and pointing loaded guns at every one who appeared at a window, without the least apparent reason. The only ground assigned by the Government for this conduct is, that one of these frantic Livornese attempted to stab a Lieutenant Giusti this morning, and was disarmed by the bystanders, but surely this is not a sufficient reason for such proceedings as I and every one here have witnessed ? " I hear that the Tascan Government has received intelligence of a similar movement at Genoa, and that at Naples, and in Sicily also, furthor movements are threatened. The Governor here has asked permission to shoot every man taken with arms in his hand, which is aU weU enough, but I protest against the troops being allowed to behave in the bulying way I have mentioned to the peaceable public. "Lord Normanby is expected to-morrow to visit the squadron, which is by way of sailing next day, but possibly these, events may induce him to abandon the idea. " They are prepared for a similar scene this evening. The commencement of the affair yesterday was at about 6 a.m, on the Pia7za d'Armi, where the sentry of the main guard was disarmed and wounded (as the authorities assert), and this, as far as I have yet heard, is the only attempt at insurrection which has occasioned so much turmoil. "If the soldiers would remain quiet I am confident that there would be no rioting or turbulence, and with a conple of hundred blue-jackets I would stake my existence that Leghorn might be kept perfectly quiet, in spite of Messrs Mazzini and Co., but, of course, the authorities, civil and military, are overjoyed at se fine an opportunity for dis. playing their zeal." The Monitore Toscano of the 2dpublishes a report of that morning by the Commandant of Leghorn to M. Baldasseroni, the Prime Mnister, saying that tranquility was completely restored, the people returning to their ordinar occupations, and the wounded in hospital progressing favourably. The U-ommandant also reports the arrival1 of the HIereditary Prince at Leghorn the samne morning. The Grand Duke of Tuscany has published the following proclamation, dated the 2d inst. " We, Leopold, by the grace of God, &o., wishing, by an exceptional increase of severity, to secure as soon as possible the tranquillity of the city of Leghorn and the security of its inhabitants, seriously compromised by the attack on the night of tho 30th of last month, command that in the aforesaid town and the port adjoining, and in the neighbourhood to the distance of a mile, and in the upper part of the said territory comprised within the delegation of the port, the following regulations shall be observed until further orders :-1. The carrying arms of any description shall be punished by Imprisonment for a period varying from 5 to 10 years. Any permission previously granted for carrying arms shall become void after the pub. lication of the present decree. 2. All attempt4 at homicide, or personal xitacke, shall be punished with death, even when they shill have failed. 3. Every other attack or offence committed by anybody possessng arms Bhal be punished with imprisonment in a house of correction for a period varying from 10 to 20 years. 4. The perpetrators of offenoes mentioned in the three preceding paragraphs shall be tried by a permanent court-martial, estblished at Leghorn, ac oording to the organic laws regulating oourts-martiaL Oar Royal decreo of the 27th December, 185, shall remain .n force so far as it is not inconsistent with the preseut law.

MONEY MAEKE.and ITy BGJ Wednesday Evening. The funds remain without the slightest revivaL The principal transactions to-day have been in con. nexion with the arrangement for the settlement, Iwhich takes place to-mozrow, and, as these showed that many speculative purchases still remained to be carried over till the next account, there was a general absence of animation. Coneols, which left off yesterday at 92i to j, were first quoted 92i, at wbich there were subsequently buyers. The latest operations, however, were again at 921 to i, the market closing with a very dull appearance. For the new account, on the 6th of August, the final price was 921 to g. Towards the end of the day a rumour of furtber and unfavourable news frona India was extensively circulated, but, as no later intelligence is likely to arrive before the next mail, except by special steamer, and it was understood that no despatches had been received at the India-house, it was generally regarded as groundless. Bank Stock left off at 212i to 214; Reduced, 92ito ; New Three per Cents., 92I to i; India Stock, 215 to 218; and Exchequer-bill 3s. discount to par. Very beavy payments were made at the Bank to-day in discharge of advances on bills and Government securities. The rate for money on the Stock-Exchange during the morning was therefore 6 per cent., buxt a full supply was attracted, and at a later hour there were lenders at 5iper cent. Under the expectation of an early fall in the rate of discount, many depositors, it is said, have withdrawn sums fromthe joint-stock banks to avail themselves of the rate now obtainable for a month certain for loans upon Consols. The payment of the dividends commenced to-day, and in the open discount-market the transactions at 5E were more numerous. A continued depression like that now prevailing in the stock-market, in the face of an uninterrupted augmentation in the Bank bullion and the prospect of a great harvest, is almost unprecedented. The anxiety with regard to India overpowers all other considerations, and if any serious nevs were to arrive to-morrow, before the conclusion of the settlement, it would most probably produce a panic. Should any persons take advantage of the occasion to create alarm it is to be hoped they wi be traced and exposed. The operations in foreign securities continue limited, at in some instances a slight decline. Pertvian fiuctuated considerably during the day, opening at a recovery of 1I per cent., the exact amount of the late fall, and closing at 82k, the same price as yesterday. Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents. were negotiated at 961; Mexican, 22&; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 83X, 82*, 83*, 82k; ditto for the account, 82X- Russian Five per Cents., for the account, 11i4; Sardinian, for the account, 90, 89 ; Spanish Deferred, for the account, 25~ 1; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 95O, .; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 102; French Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 91; and Datch Four per Cents., 97k. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 30c. for money, and 67f. 40c. for the end of the month. Some of the letters state that a majority of the operations lately have consisted of speculative eales, in which case, in the event of any demand arising on the part of the public, a zudden reaction may at any time take place. About 90,0001. in gold, chiefly American, was sold to the Bank to-day. A further sum will be taken thereto-morrow. Sovereion also continue to retura from Scotland and Treland. The Tamar, for Brazil, to-morrow will tak-e out 33,1361., of which 22,2361. is gold and the remainder silver. A better era in joint-stock management is confidently anticipated under the operation of the Bill now in progress to provide for the criminal punishment of fraudulent Directors. Among all the instances of delinquency on the part of such establishments there is scarcely one on record in which there havenot beena few comparativelyrespectablepersons on the Board who would have entirely stopped the mischief if they had had some disgraceful penalty before their eyes as the conseouence of recklesly appending their names to accounts prepared by dishonest colleagues. Hitherto the usual plea has been " We were nearly as much deceived as the shareholders. We all had the utmost confidence in MIr. So-and-so, and, although we now see we ought to have been more vigilant, we acted for the best, and no one can impeach our honour," &c. Henceforth the statutes will indicate that, however strongly gentlemen may indulge in this kind of consolation, it has no sanction beyond the sphere of their own thoughts, and that, however they may sophisticate upon the matter, the wilful neglect of a trust voluntarily accepted, and uponL the strict fulfilment of which the fortunes of many families depend, is not only inconsistent with all those moral qualities and good intentions upon which Directors, when they have got nothing else to say, always take their stand, but is as much deserving of an ignominious sentence as is the offence of some half-starved overworked railway servant who neglects to shunt a train or transmit a danger signal. Under such a system it may be hoped we shall see no more of those strange combinations of the respectable and disreputable which have of late years characterized almost all second-rate companies. Men -will be careful how they allow of corapanionship when the consequences of lending their names unworthily will fall upon themselves more than upon others, and thus, perhaps, there wil come to be only two classes of Boards-the one consisting wholly of persons of fair reputation, the other of those characters who have hitherto been used by promoters merely as a working infusion, and who would never have had power, except over the lowest dupes, but for the fact of their appearing in lists side by side with those who thould have shunned them. Of course, however, one consequence of this altered state of affairs will be that the office of Director will be less ardently sought. When it is found that there can be no safety without vigilance, and that the post is not an offering from the shareholders to the vanity of the recipient, but involves a regular contract for work on one side in consideration of pav on the other, many of the most flaLning personages at present in this sphere of occupation will become less eager for its duties, while the new men who enter the field will in many instances require higher remuneration, and a great reform in the system on which their responsibilities are to be undertaken. The question of higher pay is easy of solution, since the cost of a few efficient well-paid men will be less than that of a vast number, such as bave usually hitherto been induced to join on the understanding that their names only were wanted, and that the time required would be but an hour a-week in the Board room, -where they might take their coffee and read the papers. With regard to improved methods, so as to insure that the necessary distribution of labour shall not, as is too often now the case, prove inconsistent with a thorough concentration of responsibility, many snggestions will occur to practical minds. At the same time, if responsibility is to be thoroughly brought home, Directors will demand that the system shall be such as to afford them individually allpossible protection. To aid both objects it would be hard to find a better plan than that proposed in the following communication. The appotinent of an independent person to sit at the Board without the power of voting or of initiating any measure, to audit, as it were, hourly on the parr; of the shareholders the entire conduct of the undertaking, might not only prevent mystification and jobbery, but moderate party animosities, prevent majorities from disregarding minorities, and protect the personal position of each in case of any after- question. Persons of triedteinper and experiencemen of the world with no interest in-the concrra except to preserve it, solicitors, barristers, and others accustomed to weigh, tolerate, and harmonize conflicting motives, would be the class especially fitted for such duties. Something akin to the practice has already been tried, and with a result which showed its efficacy. When tho (overnment made their final arrangements with the noto- rious New Zealand Company, they appointed a gentleman to sit at the Board in this capacity of auditor. He soon saw enough to lead him to make strong representations to the Colonial M£inister, which, if attended to, might have averted much of the mischief that ensued. In that cae, it is true, the Directors combined against him, and were sufficiently powerful to counteract his efforts, but this was simply owing to his post being dependent on the will of an individual, If his appesl had been to a body of shlareholders the consequencea would have been different. At all events, if they had neglected it they would have had only themelves; to blame .- " 17, Warwick-street, gent.street, July 8. "Sir,-The proposod legistioa 'itk reirA to oint'

SILVECLOCK (Before thc LoFRD CHiAbCELLOTR Wheoplaintis' In this suit is the well-knownEau -de-Cologne manufacturer, and the bill sought to restrain the defendant from printing or selling labels mn imitation of those used by the plaintiff on bis bottles. The case came in the first instance before Vice-Chancellor Wood, and his Honour yranted an injunction in the terms of tho prayer of the bilL The Lord Chancellor, on appeal, reversed that decision, but at the same time gave the plaintiff liberty to bring an action within one year to establish his right. It appeared that the year was about to expire, and oonsequently the present motion was made for an extension of the time. Mr. DANiEL and Mr. HErHERINGTON, in support of the application, stated that the delay in prosecuting the action had arisen from the unexpected difficulties of the case, and that after the action had been set down for trial the plain. tiff had been obliged to withdraw the record in consequence of the'unavoidable absence of his counseL Mr.VWILcocKc and Mr. BUXTON resisted the motion. The LoEu CHANCELLOR extended the time fer trying the action upon the terms of the plaintiff paying all the costs here and at law occasioned by the delay, and giving security to double the amount of the action. FIELDING V. rRESTON. This was an appeal from Vice-Chancellor Kindersley. Thoe question raised by the bill was, whether certain an,nities given by the will of the R1ev. James Fielding, dated 1S07, were to be paid out of the leasehold and funded property of the testator. It appeared that the general personal estate was not sufficient to pay the annuities in full, and the leasehold and funded property of the testator was begueathed by him to his son for life, and afterwards to his daughter and her issue. The Vice-Chancellor held that the leasehold and funded property was not specifically bequeathed, and therefore any deficiency in the annuities given by the will of the testator must be paid out of such parts of his estate. The LORD CuAXstcELLOP reviewed all the cases relating to the point, and said that he felt no doubt in coming to the conolusion that the leaseholds were specifically bequeathed, and therefore no' liable to make good any deficiency in the annulties given by the wilL. With respect to the funded property, although he entertained some doubt upon the point at first, he had come to the same conclusion as the vTice.Chancellor, that thereowas no specific bequest of it. The decree would be varied as to the leaseholds, and the costs come out of the estate. Mr. Teed, Mr. Glasse, MIr. Baily, Mr. Goldsmidi, Mr Wickens, hIr. H.

COURT OF QUEEN'S BENOCE. GTT.r)TTAT.t. .T-T.V Q RAIT AND ANOTHER V. THACKER AND ANOTHEL. (SWings at isi Priu5, before' Lord CAWsBF and S^aeciad Jutnes.\ uxr. sI. Unamners, L,.U., and Mir. J. A. Russell anpeared for the plaintiffs; hlr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. iannen for the defendants. The plaintiffs in this action were printers in Newgate. street, and they sued the defendants, the Messrs. Thacker, the proprietors of a periodical called the Overland News, to recover damages for removing the printing of that periodical from the plaintiffs' establishment without giving a reasonable notice. It appeared from the plaintiffs' evidence that the defe ndants, -who are East India agents, had originally published a paper called the Overland Circular; but i the year 1856 tbeydeterminedtogiveupthatpublicationand to substitute the Ozcrland News in its place. The plaintiffs applied to be employed to print the new work, and submitted to the defendants specimens of type. The terms, &c., being satisfactory to the deferdants, the plaintiffs undertook to compose the work and to get it printed by a machine-printer. The plaintiffs, when they undertook the work, found it necessary to purchase additional type suitable for it and to employ several additional hands. The publication commenced in January last, and the first three numbers printed did not satisfy the defendants, owing to the machime work being done in an inferior manner; but the " machinery " being placed in more competent hands, the style of the printing was improved, and the defendants were satisfied. Matters went on till the 27th of March last, when the plaintiffs received a letter from the defendants, givingthem notice that theyshould not require their services any longer, as they had made arrangements for getting the nextand succeeding numbers of thework printed elsewhere. The plaintiffs complained of this, upon the gronnd that they had incurred considerable expense in the purchase of type, and bad employed workmen, whom they could not discharge without notice. They said the engagement was general, and they were led to believe that it was to last for a year at the least. It was contended, on their behalf, that they wero at all events entitled to have a " reasonable notice" of the intention to withdraw the printing; and evidence was given to show that the usage was to give one month's notice of discontinuance, On the part of the defendants an attempt was made by cross examnininu the plaintiff. to show that the work was so badly and negligently done as to justify the defendants in removing the printing without giving any notice whatever, and several witnesses were called who stated that they were acquanted with the trade of printers, and they had never k.own the usage relied upon by the plaintiffs. T'he case was in part heard yesterday, but when the trial was resumed this morning both the learned leaders were necessarily absent in other conrts. The condict of the cause therefore devolved upon the two juniors, Mr. J. A. Russell and Mr. Hannen. Lord CASXIMFELL, in snmming up the evidence, passed a warm encomitlm upon both the learned juniors for the manner in which they had condunted the cases of their respective clients, and left it to the jary to say whether the one month's notice which the plaintiffi claimed was proved to he a usual notice in the trade. The jury found for the plaintiffs-Damages 251. WALLS V. GOP A.qD ANOTnER. 'Mr. Needham appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Turner for the defendants. This was an action to recover a balance of 9101., due to the plaintiff for advances made in the purchase of a vessel, and in paying for repairs, &c. The question was whether the defendaut Goff was a partner of the other defendant Miellish, who had snffered judgment by default. At the close of the plaintiff's case the defendants' counsel, at the suggestion of his Lordship, submitted to a verdict, the amount to be settled out of court. 'USBORNE V. GLENDINNING. Mfr. J. Wilde, Q.C., and Mr. Blackburn appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Petersdorff for the defendant. Theplaintiff in this action, Major Usborne, was a cornfactor, and he sued the defendant, Adam Glendinning, a warehouseman at Sufferance-wharf, Bermondsey, to recover the value of 235 quarters of corn, which were lost to the plaintiff by the alleged negligence of the defendant. It appeared from the plaintiff's evidence that at the end of December last he had received a cargo of wheat from New York per the vessel Walter Scott, lying in the East India docks. He employed the defondant as a lighterman to convey the corn from the vessel and to warehouse it in his warehouse at Bermondsey, and it appeared that on the 1st of January the defendant hired a lighter from a Mr. Lucy, a barge builder at Bermondsey, and sent It to the East India docks, in the charge of his own servants, to fetch the corn. The vessel was loaded, and at a little before 5 o'clock it came out at the basin; but, as it would be high water at 5 o'clock, and the barge required the flood tide to get up to Bermondsey, the barge was moored for the night to another barge in the basin. The barge was seen al right bythe watchmen in the conrse of the night, And so late as half-past 1 o'clock the next morning, but by a little before.2 o'clock it was missing, and it was afterwards found to have quietly sunk in 22 feet of water. The declaration charged the defendant with negligence im keeping, carryine, and lading the goods; and it was suggested by the plaintiff's counsel that, as the barge ik u: Atill. w4er, without any apparent cause tho fair irference was that the barge was defective, and that it had sEnk firom having a hole in the bottom. Mr. Serjeant SHEE submitted that there was no evidence of naegligence. Lord CAs:BELL said, he thought there was evidence for the jury. Mr. Serjeant SEZE then caUed several witnesses to show that when the barge was taken to the docks it was to all appearance in a perfectly sound and dry state. Luny, the owner of the barge, was caled, and stated that he had thoroughly repaired it in August last, and that he had examined it all over a day or two before he had hired it out to the defendant, when it was perfectly sound. The man who was in charge of the barge said, that when he left it, at about 6 o'clock, he had used the pump, but it had made no water; and Similar evidence was given by another witness. Lord CAuriaxRL., in summing up the evidence, said,he did not seo that there had been any negligence in navigating the barge, but his Lordship lefe it to the jury to say whether or. net the barge was sufficient. jh ury retired to consider their verdict, and eventually fon or te plaintiff, upon the ground of the insugiciency of the barge, and that there had been negligence.

THsrGsrs this morning proceeded to address the jury in reply for the plaintiff in this case. Ho commencod by disclaiming any intention of endeavonring to inflame their mindaby the vulgar prejudices entertained against attorneysThe question was, not the high respectability of Mr. Sinip' son, but whether in this cause he had exercised that diligence and judgment which were required of him. When an action was brought against a man he bad recourse to his attorney and fuUy stated to him the whole of the facts, anditwastheduty of the attorneyto extract from the client the nature of the action and the evidence that could be brought to bear upon the case of the defendant, and then, after receiving the pleadings, to prepare a brief; and the attorney did not relieve himself from responsibility by sending the brief to the client, who could not be supposed -to understand its different bearings. The attorney then delivered the brief to counsel, who could not go beyond the information it contained. When the case came on for trial then the counsel's responsibilty commenced, and he acted in the conduct of the cause according to his judgment and discretion. These being the different duties of the parties, let them look at the conduct of the defendants. In an action for breach of promise of marriage one important point was the amount of the property of the defendant; bat in this instance Mr. Simpson seemed to have been inoculated with the sanguine view of Mr. WoodfLne, and to have only looked to the verdict. He thought it was the duty of the attorney to look to every phase of the case, and Mr. Simpson ought to have seen that if a verdict should go the other way the amount of property became of the greatest importance. His friend said the brief did contain that information. The brief said, " The defendant is a brewer at Horuchurch, in a good business, and his father died lately possessed of considerable property." Did that convey to the counsel any information at all of the amount of the property? But it did convey to them the idea that the defendant was a man of great property. The preparation of the brief was governed by the extraordinary mistake into which Mr. Simpson had fallen. His friend had said that that had been no disadvantage to the plaintiff, because he had been Informed of the mnistake by Mfr. Roberts some days before the trial; but the whole brief was prepared upon the assumption that the plaintiff and the defendant could both be examined. The brief had been sent to Mr. Woodfine with his proofs, and instructions for the cross-examination of Miss Smith were set forth. But that fact was never communicated to counsel, who re. ceived the brief denuded of the information as to the pro. perty which had before appeared in the evidence of MrWoodfine. They then came to the turning point of the case, upon which:there was contradiction in the evidence. It was said by the plaintiff that circumstances had occurred which rendered it necessary for the defendants to be extremely cautious, and to have communicated to the counsel the evidence that could have been given upon the value of the property. Mr. Smith's evidence was a statement which he asserted Mr. Woodfine had made to him. He could not be contradicted, but the ascertained value of the property could be shown, and Mr. Woodfine, Mrs. Woodfine, and the two daughters positively stated that a communication of this kind had been made to Mr. Simpson and Mr. Roberts, and they were told witnesses must be called. All this must be true, or must be fabricated, and they must have comoe here deliberately to perjure themEelves. Mr. Simpson and Mr. Roberts denied this, but it might be that they had a blank memory, forgetting that it had taken place. To show how things might be orgotten, the Lord Chief Justice, when frst examined, did not recollect that the trial had lasted more than one day; therefore it was easily to be imagined that Mr. Simpson and Mr. Roberts might have forgotten the circumstances, but. on the part of the other parties it would remain impressed on their memory to the end of their days. The difference in the position of the rties was extremely great. The fact of Mr. and Mrs woodfine meeting Mr. Uolier on the Monday morning, and making arrangements with bim to come to the court when sent for, would in a great measure go to confirm their statemnents. The Lord Chief Justice, with the authority of his positon, had given an opinion, in which, had he been a more humble person, he ventured to imagine he would have been checked. He stated that he thought there never was a case in which attoreys could be held to be less responsi. ble. He much douited whether any counsel would be bold enough to take upon himself the hazardous responsibility of not calling witnesses when imperatively desired to do so by the client. But Mr. Roberts, having stated that he never heard Collier's name, or Mason's name, of course could not have communicated to counsel the desire of the client ; therefore counsel could not have had that information upon which alone they could exercise a proper discretion. The evidence of Mr. and Mrs. Thompson yesterday, as to what Mrs. Thompson had stated to Mr. Roberts, was a confirmation of the evidence given upon the point by the other parties. He now came to a part of the case wh ich he thought would strengthen the evi. dence of the Woodfines, because if the defendants' oase was correct there was no ground for an application for a new trial. The trlal terminated on the 7th of July, and on the following day these defendants sent a telegraphic communication to the plaintiff-" Come up immediately, counsel say we can get a new trial ;" and they wrote that very day to the plaintiff a letter in which they mentioned the names of Colher, Mason, and Shaw, as persons who must speak to the value of the property. He said there was mistake of law and neglect of duty, and failure to communicate to counsel the information which was absolutely requisite in the conduct of the cause. His friend had amused himself by reading Mr. Woodfline's letters to Miss Smith, but he (Sir Frederick must say that, according to his recollection of his younger days, the letters were as wise as he had ever read- they were, in fact, according to his idea, rather too cold. it was said that Mr. Smith had made a statement of that which had been given him by Woodfine, and that that was a contract between them as to the amount of his property, and must conclude him for ever. Many men vapoured and boasted of their property. It was assumed that the damages must have been the same had witneEses been called bhut what right had the defendants to speculate upon this7 At all events, why had they not performed their duty by in. forming their counsel of the facts ? If they had not done this they were guilty of the negligence imputed to them. He charged them with negligence in not inouiring as to the property of the plaintiff, with a mistake of the law, and with not having called WitneSseS after the desire of their client, and with not having given that information to counseL. Mr. Justice WIGTrINAN then summed up. The charge made by the;plaintiff was that the defendants hadcconducted his defence in the prior action in an unskliful, careless, negligent, and improper manner, by reason whereof Miss Smith recovered a verdict against the now plaintiff for much larger damages than otherwise would have been giveu. It seemed that the plaintiff was unacquainted with the defendants up to the time of his applying to them. It was said that up to a comparatively late period of the case the defen. dants were of opinion that Wooddne himself could be examined as a witness. Now, by law he could not, and therefore it was suggested that, so far as the property was concerned, the defendants ought to have called, or instructed counsel to call, or told them the nauses of, certain witnesses, who could have shown that the property had been very much exaggerated by Mr. Smith. It seemed to him (the judge) that there was hardly any ground for charging negligence in not having diecovered down to a late period that Woodfine could not be examined as a witness ; but the mother was put down in the brief. But it was said that beyond that the defendants ought to have entered into a statement of the property in detail for the informas tion of counsel. It ruiht be that in the Sirst plae it was important in such an action to showv the state and condition of the defendant in that action, but it could not be anticipated what evidence would be given onthe part of the plaintiff. It seemed to him that down to the Saturday, at the end of the trial, there was nothing unusual in the conduct of those who managed the case. The evidence as to wbat had taken place on the Saturday afternoon and on the Monday morning was conRicting, and the jury must decido between the parties, But the learned counsell who bad been in ithe case had been examined, and they had stated that in their opinion it would have been very imprudent to call witnesses, and thereby to give a reply to the opposite counseL The circumstances of the prior case had been introduced to show that there was nothing extraordinary in the jury giving the amount of 3,0001. The learned judge then went through the whole of the case of the breach of promise of marriage, and of the evidence appertaining to it. he question for the jury was whether the damages would have been less had the defendants conducted the case differently and called witnesses, or had informed the counsel of the desire of the client that witnesses should be called. The jury retired, and having been absent some time they sent a note to the judge, upon which his LORDSHIP conferred with the counsel on both sides, and the jury were sent for, and upon their coming into court his LORDssEn told them that in consequence of their note the parties had agreed to withdraw a juror. Juror withdrawn. THE PRINCE OF WALES LIFE AND EDUCATION INSURANCE SOCD;TY V. IHARDING. Mr. Serjeant Byles, Mr. M. Smith, and Mr. Edwards were counsel for the plaintiffs; Sir F. Thesiger, Sir F. Kelly, and Mr. Field for the defendant. According to the plaintiffs' case they had granted an insurance on the life of Richard Paul Joddrell in three policies amounting together tollr,OOr., but they, according to their usage, had reassured 10,50£. of this sum in the Athen*vun insurance-office, of which the defendant wam manager under the Winding-up Act. Several other inFurances had been effected in other offices for large sums on Joddrell's life. Joddrell died, and then there was a meeting cf all the insurance companies and A subscription was en- tered into for the purposes of defending and resisting aU actions that might be brought against them. Actions were brought by a Ir. Truelock on the three polioies in question; they were defended, ind were tried in the Court of Queen's Bench, and verdicts were given in favour of True. lock, the launtiff in those actions. The Athennomn was unsuccessfuL and the defendant was appointed manager nnder the Winding-up Act. Theplaintiffs paid the 11,0001, and then called upon the Atheneum to pay, but upon their refsal this action wes brought; and they said, in defenoe, first, that the signatures were not properly affixed to the policy; secondly, that tho pldntiffs had not paid the premiums; and thirdly, that the seal had not been properly It was stated that these were questions of law, and they were reserved for the opinion of the Court above, but a verdict was taken for the plaintiffs for 10,500L
_ COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. aDTmm--rAT.T. .TM.- Q OKUOARD V. BOOTr. I tVej-c 0orc (liftef Judice CoCKBUa and a SPeciaL 3url.} -ir. Movul, Q.U., and Mr. EL. Bullar appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Montagu Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. T. Jones for the defendant. This was an action brought upon a bill of exchange for 5001., dated the 4th of June, 18.51, drawn by Richard Kirkman Lane upon and accepted by the defendant, and by Lane indorsed to the plaintiff. The defendant's only plea was an equitable one, to the effect that on this bill becoming due the defendant gave a renewed bill for the same amount to Lane, who was authorized by the plaintiff to receive such renewed bill; that the renewed bil had been paid at maturity, and that consequently the defendant was not liable to pay tho original bill, which ouaht, in fact, to have been given up to the defendant; ana that on this biU again coming into Lane's hands again he cancelled the acceptance with the authority of the plaintiff, and that Lane afterwards assigned all his property to trustees and was made bankrupt. The plaintiff is a siUanercer, the defendant a gentleman of fortune, and Lane a well-known attorney and bill discounter. The bil appeared to have been accepted by the defendant for money lent to him by lane. Subsequently Lane indorsed it to theplaintiff to secure a debt of 2001., for which the plaintiff or some time had held some diamonds, which were given up in exchange for the bill. The plaintiffnow sought to recover this 2001. and interest. Lane, being called as a witness for the defendant, deposed that on the bil becoming due the plaintiff authorized him to cancel it on obtaining from the defendanta renewed bill, which was accordingly done; that the bil remained in his possession until after his assignment, whenhe gave it in a cancelled state to his attorney, Mr. Asprey, who gave it to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was in the habit of lending money to aLne at 10 per cent. interest for the purposo of discounting bills. Mr. Booth, the defendant, according to Lane's evidence, was wholly unaware that this bill remained in the hands of the plaintiff when the renewed bil was given, which latter the defendant eventually settled in account with Lane. The witness further alleged that he had cancelled the original billin the plaintiff's presence. To contradict this evidence the plaintiff was caled, and entirely denied all knowledge of Lane having settled with the defendant, or that the biU was ever delivered to Lane for that purpose. After a careful summing up by the learned JuDno, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for 2571. 8s. 7d., Deing the amount of the 2001. advanced by the plaintiff on the bill, together with interest. This cause occupied all the day. SECOND COURT. (Before Mr. Justce CBEssw9x; and Common Juries, at Guildhal1.) MOSES V. TAYLOR. Mr. Petersdorff and Mr. Cook Evans appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Parry was counsel for the defendant. This was an action brought against the accePtor of a bil of exchange, at three months' date, for 251., drawn by one Morris Myers, and by him endorsed to Ephraim Levi Green, discounted by Reuben Michael, and eventually sued upon by the plaintiff, EUas Moses, the holder. According to the case opened and proved on behalf of the plaintifi the defendant, m January last, borrowed from Myers, the drawer, a sum of 221. in a publichouse called the Bird-inthe-Hand, in Bow-road, at the same time handing over a blank acceptance, whtch it was agreed that Myers should fll up some time afterwards as a bill at three months' date for 251. The defendant, however, aworethat no such meeting in Bow-road and no such arrangement had ever taken place, but that, in the beginning of 1856 and before he became bankrupt, which event took place during that year, he had given to Myers two blank acceptances to meet a b for 881. which was coming due; and he contended that his liability on these acceptances was extinguished by his bankruptcy; but that Myers had filled up one of these documents, had con. cocted the story which he had told about the 221. loan, and now sought by pttin in force the bill so constructed to obtain from tne defeneant some portion of the money which hehadlostby thebankruptcy, he having been one of the defendant's creditors at the time. Several witnesses were called on each side, and Mr. CooK EvANS, in the absence of his leader, having replied on the whole case. Mr. Justice CREsSWELL told the jury that on one side or the other there had been perjury of the grossest nature, and that he should ask them whether they thought the bill sued upon had been secepted in blank before the defendant became bankrapt, or whether it had been accepted since the bankruptcy for a fresh consideration. The jury said that they were of opinion that the bill sued upon had been accepted before the defendant became bankrupt, Whereupon T4he learned JUDGE directed that a verdict be entered for theplaintlff, with leave to the defendant to move to enter it in his favour in case the Court should be of opinion that the authority to fill up the bill was revoked by tbe bankraptcy, and generally en the material issues raised by the pleadings.-Vtrdict accord-ngly. BARGMAN V. WATTS. Mr. Prentice appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Collier, Q.C., for the defendant. This was an action for slander, brought under the folowing circumstances :-In May last a Mr. Ragg had lost a fowl, and one day in that month the defendant met him and said, " Mr. Bargman came round with a tub under his arm, and the fowl jumped out, and he caught it and put it in again." These were the words complained of, and inasmuch as the accusation that Mr. Bargman had stolen the fowl in question was utterly unfounded this action was brought. The case for the plaintiff having been proved, and it having been elicited an cross-examination that at a meeting of neighbours, held at a publichouse to investigate the matter, Mr. Watts had denied the exact terms of the slander, and had averred that the words which he used were not "Mr. Bargman," but " a bargeman," Mr. Justice CRESSwELL said that had he known what kind of cases he should be called upon to try he would not have made such exertions to come down to Guildhall to hold a second court, and that it was an insult to any body of men to ask them to sit there to dispose of such paltry questions. Mr. COLLtiE-One would have thought the County Court would have been the proper tribunal. Mr. Justice CoR wSSVLL.-No court would be the proper tribunal; lf you get a verdict it will do you no good. Mr. PR5EN0m-Shall I then act wisely in withdrawing Mr. Justice CRESSmELL.-..ost wisely. A juror was accordingly withdrawn.
I COURT OF EXCHEQUEBR WEDNESDAY. .Tm.V R ,UKUJJ AUSTYN V. GRIFF1THS ANn ANVATV t,bwmgs at Nui Primc, at Guildhal, beforc the CHEF BARON and a S,ecii uzru.1 inms was an issue directed by the Lords Justices to try whether there had been a trading and an act of bankruptcy to support an adjudication of bankruptcy against the Hon. Mr. Mostyn, now Lord Mostyn, in 1853. The defendant Griffiths was the petitioning creditor. His debt was upon a bond given in May, 1839, by UIr. Mostyn for 1,2001. In 1852 he had entered up judgment in an action on the bond, and his petition in bankruptcy was founded onthejudgment debt of 8271. The act of bankruptcy upon which the adjudication proceeded was the neglect to satisfy this judgment debt, under the 12th and 13th Victoria, cap. 106, sec. 104. The alleged trading took lace in the years 1847 and 1848, and was es follows :-The ease of some col1ieries, part of Lord Mostyn's estate, ter. ininatingin 1S47, the collieries were worked on his Lordship's behalf for some 14 months. During tbat period a steamer called the Vesta. which belonged to Lord Mostyn, and another called the Ayrshire Lassie, which was hired, were used for the purpose of towing ships up a creek or gut of the sea at Mostyn, in Flintshire, near to the pits, where they were loaded with the coal. These steamers were also used for the carriage of passengers and goods between Mostyn and Liverpool for hire, the fares and rates of freight and the days and hours of sailing being advertised. The Vesta made the passage daily in summer, and every alternate day in winter. Upon these facts Lord Mostyn was adjudicated a bankrupt in 1853, as a shipowner, wharfinger, and carrier. The Cimsr BAoN ruled that in point of law there bad been no act of bankruptcy. The judgment debt, in respect of which the supposed act of bankruptcy had been committed, did not come into existence unti after the trad. ing, assuming there bad been any trading within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Acts. As to the trading, his lordship told the jury that "shipowners, wharfingers, and. camriere5 were among the catalogue of persons named in the 12th and 13th of Victoria, cap. 106, as persons liable to be made bankrupts. But the mere possession of a ship or even its profitable use did not necessarily constitute a man a shipowner in the sense of being a trader subject to the bankrupt laws. The teFt to be applied in order to ascertain whether a person is a " shipowner, whaHinger, or carrier" is whether he makes his livelihood by one, or other, or all of these callings. If the jury were satisfied that the wharf and the steamers were necessary for the working of the collieries, and that the use of the wharf byother persons on the payment of wharfage and the emp oyment of the steamers in carrying passengers and oods for hire was ancillary to their use for the purposes of the coleries, and was adopted merely that Lord Mostyn might make the most of things which it was necessary he should have for the working of his collieries, then his Lordship was of opinio- that did not constitute him a trader within the Act, and the jury would, if they were satisfied the facts were so, find for the plaintiff *T-he jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, various points being reserved for the opinion of the full Court. 8ir F. Kelly, Mr. Bovill, Mfr. aymaond, nd Mr. V. *Wilhiams were counsel for the plaintiff; Serjeant Shee, Mr. MI. Smith, Mr. Hannen, and Mr. H. James appeared for the defendante.

IRELAND. Tfl = SADLMP ESTATES. DUBLI&, WmxwsAy MoRzqn=G. .ne estates or J ames ulameir were sold yesterday in the Encumbered Court at the suit of the official mnanager for winding up the affairs of the Tipperary Bank. The sale was most successful, aud is worth special mention as a striking proof of the surprising nerease within a few brief years of the value of land in Ireland. Thus the first lot Coolnamuck, which was purchased in May, 1852, for 8,5001., was knocked down to an English speculator yesterdUy at 13,0001. Lot 2, Kilconnell, purchased so late 'as March 1854, for 5,3001., was also bought by an English gentleman, the price paid being 12,2001. Lot 3, Lisowen, purchasedin August, 1855, for8101, realized 1,4001. Gross total 26,6001., on a nominAl rental of something over 1,2001. a-year, subject, however, to deductions, which would probably reduce the net profit rent to 1,0001. The immense estates of John Sadleir are not to be put up for sale until November next. They are valued at between 250,0001. and 300,0001. COLLEGE COMMENCEMENTS.

KOO.RrA MOORIA GUANO. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Several extracts have appeared in various metro. politan papers relative to the above matter, taken from the Indian press, which are calculated to convey an erroneous impression among our friends who have despatched their vessels to load at the Kooria Mooria islands; otherwise we should not trouble you with further discussion on this matter. We must premise that it was not our wish to throw this natter open to tho publio; our intention was to import the guano on our own account, taking all the risks of the enter. prise. This intention we relinquished only on finding that Government was resolved not to accord us the protection of a ship of war (which was absolutely requisite for the successful prosecution of this business), unless we consented to throw the trade open. The Secretary of tho Colonies ap. prised us some weeks since that the Cordelia screw-corvette bad departed for the purpose of superintending operations at the islands. The subordinate officers of the East India Company have exhibited little disposition to aid us in this matter. On the contrary, there was a general feeling among them that our ETome Government had exceeded their province in obtaining cession of those islands without the aid of their diplomacy; hence a feeling rather against than in favour of the enterprise. As our terms for vessels loading there do not exact payment until the cargo is on board, we cannot see that there is any ground for the alarm exhibited by Commander Haines, of the Indian navy, who, without wishing to impugn his motives, we cannot help saying, writes rather in the spirit of a partisan. It certainly would be mortifying, should the result prove as favourable as we anticipate, that Commander Haines while surveying was in close proximity to a deposit of such great value, and at the same time remained in happy ignoranco of it. The Government having granted the protection required disposes of Captain Haines's anxieties as to the disturbances likely to be experienced from tho few wandering piratical Arabs who prowl about this coast. Now, as to the danger to ships loading from storms and unsate anchorage, we have statements from several experienced shipmasters, that the water is perfectly smooth during the season, commenc. Ing in September and ending in April; landing and loading can be effected without the slightest danger or inconveni. ence; and somo go so far as to assert that operations can be carried on during the whole of the year. In corroboration of our views we beg to direct attention to the following extract from a report made by Captain Freomantle, of Her Majesty's ship Juno:-" It isonly just to observe that from the beginning of October until the latter end of May the weather is uniformly serene, and ships may approach and anchor on either side of all the isLands in perfect security." It is also reported to us that in the island of Hasiki there are five natural harbours, in which some 70 sail may lie at anchor land-locked and in perfect safety. At the time Commander Haines surveyed those islands 1835 and 1836, the value of guano was but imperfectly known, consequently the deposits were then overlooLed as of no importance; but in his statement he admits that the islands were the resort of " myriads of birds of the gannet species, the excrement giving quite a whito appearance ;" and again he says, " the surfaces of several of these islands were certainly in most parts covered with gnano, partica. larly the western and eastern islands." If the birds, then, resorted in myriads, and had covered the surfaoes of the islands with guano, giving them a white appearance, we presume the deposit then made still remains with that accumulated during the 20 years that have elapsed inoe this observation was made. Did Commander Haines calculate what the deposit would amount to, provided the birds had resorted to the islands for many centuries previous to his visit, as there is every reason to believe they had? Further, our own people when they were driven off by the Arabs had dug seven feet down, and stil found the supply of guano unexhausted; the captains and men connected with the expedition all concurred in stating that the quantity, though of varying quality, was exceedingly large. It may be well to state that in sounding with a rod the point of the staff frequently came in contact with large masses of a substance which, on analyzation, was proved to contain 80 per cent. of phosphate of lime, and as these masses were dispersed throughout the deposit, at greater or less depths from the surface, it was impossible to arrive at even an approximate estimate of the quantity. As regards quality, the East Indian writers speak disparagingly of a guano containing 5 to 7 per cent. of ammonia. We have now before us a samplo of Upper Peruvian analyzing less than 5 per cent. of ammonia, with 63 per cent. of phosphate of lime, which sold a short timo sinco at 11 10s. per ton. We estimate the average quality whicb will be imported from Kooria Mooria to bo now worth 10 10a. to 11&; tho phosphates alluded to as being dispersed throughout the deposit were valued a few weeks sinoe by a manufacturer at 8L per ton. Peoplo unconnected with this business forget that the growing scarcity of the article renders samples that previously were comparatively neglected now of high value. All the reports we have yet received confirm us In our opinion that the quantity is considerably in excess of the general estimate, and that the quality will prove satisfactory to beth shipowner and agriculturst. Captain Ord will be at the iands, in a steamer sent out by ourselves, to give al the aid required, and he, with assistants, will superintend the loading of each vessel, so that no master wfill be allowed to takre on boErd a cargo likely to prove other than satis. factory.

Munxni INDwrviuAL AD COLLECTVE.-A long time agoagentleman engaged as clerk at a railway station in Duboin was sitting in his office counting money belongin to the company. Somebody broke into his room, murdered the clerk, carried off a portion of the money, and eluded discovery down to the present day. That which was above the cancity of the Dublin police has been supplied by a remar able instance of conjugal affection-the man's wife has denounced him to the police, in order that he might be compelled to repent, and thus his soul be saved. No sooner did the slightest breath of this story get abroad than the vehement interest in the death of Mr. Little was at once revived in all quarters. A young Frenchman, apparently rather ffighty in his habits, was engaged in a commercial situation in Scotland - he formed an attachment with a lady, or with two ladies; Le dies with symptoms of poisoning, a story is whispered about that one of the ladies, who was ostensibly engaged to be married to him, had acquired other views, and that she had taken unfair means to put him out of the way. Instantly there is an intense excitemenb on the subject of IL L'Angelier and his death. It is necessary to convey the accused young lady through a Scotch city in a elandestine manner, lest the public should give her a state reception, or execute summary justice upon her in Lynch fashion, before there is the slightest proof that she is guilty of the crime imputed to her. With all this anxious regard for life, this sym pathy for those who suffer from unforeseen attack, this eager desre to infict justice upon the murderer of an individual,masses ofourfellow-creaturesare consigned to cer. [ taindeath by adll-knownproceSs wvith a degree of calm. ness and inlifference almost unaccountable. The process is caled " n excursion-train." The death is certain, because it inevitably results from arrangements actually adopted and deliberately planned. On a crowded railway one train is kept at a station long after the time appointed for it; another train is sent down the same line at a rapid pace; the signals sent to stop the driver of the supervening train are not sufficient to attract notice, and it follows that the degree of mechanical force applied by the moving train to the stationary train strikes and crashes the bodies and limbs of the passengers in a manner to prodace death, mutilation, or in some cases permanent sufferng to those who survive. All this we know beforehand; but the proce_s is repeated withasdeliberate andas coolamind asifwe had noneofthat sympathy for the preservation of life, none of that horror at the infliction of death, as when a single person is the victim. There is a kind of universal shout for the uncondemned Spollen and the suspected Madeleine Smith; but there is no cry to have up those railway directors that continue the destructive process. They go to excess in the pursuit of railway fares, at the expense of blood, long after the rlskful nature of the traffic has been ascertained. It is a species of trade which is entirely unnecessary. The same profits might be obtained without the same risk or the same suffering. A very slight change is needed in the practice; and the change has been explained by "A Railway Director" who wrote to The limns, so that all the other railway directors in the country must be quite familiar with it. Nor is it simply a suggestion-it has been worked suc. ceasfllyonanexistingraway, if not on more than one. On most railways the instructions given to drivers and guards teach them to assume that the line is safe if they see no signal to the contrary. The plan recommended by the Railway Director inverts that instruction; the driver is to assuue that there is danger on the line unless he see a positive signal that it is safe. He should not advance from one station to another until it be positively ascertained tbat it is safe for him to do so. That part of the principle ha been ado pted on the North-Western Railway ; it was in force on the North Rent line until abrogated for the nonce by the driver of the train; but the driver should not approach the next station without signalled permission. And no rules will prevent accidents unless they are obeyed.- Spectator. BATH ELECTION EXPEwsEs.-The returns made to Mr. T. W.

RER MAJESTY's VISIT TO ALDBRSHOTT. Thq dull routine of cami life at Aldershott Wassenuened.1 yesterday by a State vuit. 'Her Majesty, attended by the Court and a numerous staff, was present at a most brilliant field-day, and afterwards made 6 formal inspection of the whole cantonments, including the real camp where the tents are pitebed among the fits and little dells of Cove Common. Fsrnborough station -was quite overrun with visitors en this occasion, but the admirable arrangements there and the obliging conduct of the railway managers, 'who ren special train to accommodate the influx of passengers from London, prevented the imeonvenience which so frequently arises to the publie ix Uteir attempts to follow the movements of Her Majesty. A. very large nurmber of passengers were brought down to 3aruborough by thesc extra trains, eud even those who were unable to procure other mesns oe transit met with no wrse hindrance thau a briefwalk tkrough tie fir woods to -Aldershott. All the way from theetation to the camp was lioed with spectaters from the neighbouriig villages, who, .in this district at least, seem to hawe bolydays at commaud, and to resort to thom oa- the smallest provocation. 'The darklooking downs, too, which ctretjh away from the camp in bleak esd almest endless succession were co%ered with vehioles of -evcy ki-id, aicd a whole brigade -of fair equestrians hovered hke light cavalry upon every movement of the troop3 throughout the day. The Royalparty arrivedat theprisatestationon the SouthWe,tern Railway soon ater, 9 o'clock, and at a few minutes lheFore 10 reached Farnberough, where a detachment of the 7th Hussars 'was in attendanoe and escorted the cortgc to camp. Along the whole line of route Her Majesty was anost warnly welcomed, and the cheers fronk the spectators announced her arrival almost before the field batteries salated from the hill overlooking the south cantouments. Etr Majesty drove at once to the pavilion, vhere she -changed her ordinary sro.-ning attire for a riding costume, and at 11 o'clock the iUustrious visitors rode down to the long valley where the troops had been formed up for inspection. Her Majesty was mounted on a superb bay charger and wore her scarlet riling habit with a wilitary sash and open riding hat with a smail plume of red said white feathers. Prince Frederick of Prussia, in the uniform of a Colonel of Prussian Dragoons, xTode on the right of ler Majesty. His Royal Highness the Prince Consort, in a Field Marshal's uniform, the Duke ,of Cambridge, the Princess Charlotte of Belgium, and the Prince of Hohenrzollern, were on the left. The Princess Royal and Princess Alice followed in a pony carriage. Among the suite and staff in attendance were MajorGeneral Wetherall, Sir R. Airey, Viscountess Jocelyn, Lady Churchill, the Hon. Louisa Gordon, Lord Charles Fitzroy Captain the Hon. D. de Roe, Barou de MUltke, Baron Alvenrleben, the MLaster of the Household, &c. The troops were drawn up in a lice of contiguous columns, which stretched across almost the entire length of the long valley, from east to west. Viewed from a little distance, they were a perfect, and seemed a numerous, army, complete in all the various requisites of hard field service. Yet the spectators may be surprised to learn to-day that, counting all-officers and men-there were less than 9,000 troops upon the ground. The actual numabers were 390 officers, 30 guns, and S,200 men. Two troops of Horse Artillery formed the extreme right, and exteoding from that point to the opposite end of the line were the 1st Dragoon Gaards, 6th Enniskillens, 7th and 15th Hussars, a field battery, a detachment of Sappers and Miners, 1st BattalUon of Coldstream Guards, thE. 54th, 66th, and 22d Regiments, a field battery, 15th and 96th Regiments, 1st Battalion of Rifle Brigade, a field battery, the 20th and 97th Regiments, and the 3d Battalion of the Rifle .drlgade. In rear of the men the waggons of the ailitary and pontoon trains were drawn up in double liaes. As the Royal party approached the arns of the whole force were presented with an almost instantaneous movement ; the colours were lowered and the National Anthem resounded across the heath. Her Majesty rode along the frout of the line, and,. passing rapidly down in rear of the columns, took up her position on a commanding hil at the foot of the steep eminence caled Ctesar's Camp. As soon as the Royal party were faily stationed the evolutions of the troops commenced. It is by no means easy at the outset to discern the peculiar line of strategy about to be adopted on these occasions. Trumpets sound from all parts of the field; the cavalry move about in glittering confusion, guns rumble heavily across the plain, and the infantry to a civilian teem hopelessly disordered. Staff officers begin at last to fly past, and the military and pontoon trains, which previously seem in everybody's way, make successful efforts to diaentangle themselves from the crowd. But before many movements the disordered aspect v4nishes, and the whole plan of operations is unveiled to the moet civilian of spectators. Yesterday it was simply to represent the manucuvres by which a sudden attack is met and a superior force kept in check during a retreat. The heavy cavalry (the Ist and 6th Dragoons), with a troop of Horse Artillery, wheeled round in columns of troops, and advanced to the foot of C:esar's Camp, so as to form the extreme left of the defending army, while the light cavalry (the 7th and 15thHussars), with another troop of Horse Artillery, were rapidly advanced in front, the infantry moving across the plain in solid columns to snpport. The light cavalry and artillery performed this duty of advancing so effectualy that they moved quite out of sight, and appeared to have gone to threaten Winchester or Basingstoke. Tho spectators were thus left to form their own conjectures as to the arduous nature of the service in which they were engaged, while the main body of the forces moved up in brigades, and the strategical plot gradually thickened around them. After an interval of expectation, the light cavalry, could ba discerned in dark uneven masses on the hills far soath of Farnham.wood, slowing retreating along the high ground and watehing the imaginary foe beneath. The Rifles were despatehed to their support, and, breaking into skirmishing order, advanced and occupied the borders of the wood of Farnham, Immediately after the action began with an irregular dropping fire, which swelled gradually into a continued rattle. The Rifles dodged from bush to bush, crowding behind the trees and mounds, lining the hedges, always on the move, but never slackening their fire for a single instant. The Horse Artillery, with the heavy cavalry on the extrseni left, supported them with a smart cannonade; but the help was apparently unavailing, as, after a fierce defence of an orchard and farmhouse, the retreat was sounded, and the Rifles fell slowly back. They stole across the open ground ia twos and throes, turning every now and then to fire, until they gained the shelter of the light cavalry. when the ascamntc vwas sounded, and the whole regiment drawing together, retreated in double time. 'The light cavalry manocnvred to cover the movement, and in this they were supported by the troops of Horse Artillery, which commenced the cannonade in hot earnest. The re sistance, though most gallant, was supposed to be of no effect. The Artillery were ordered to limber up and retire, and the whole force commenced a rapid retreat. This was oneoof the most brilliant and animating movements of the day. The havy rumble of the field batteries as they moved off, the rapid movements of the cavalry, and. above all, the ceaseless din of trumpet and hoarse cries which rang from rank to rank, with all the hurry and confusion that seemed to pervade the foroe, gave to the whole scene the aspect of a veritable field of battle. The Horse Artillery were tIe last to retire. They emerged fronm the low plantations, pressingtheir horses to the utmost, and thundering acree-the plain with arush apparently asresistlebs as the sweep of destiny. As they fell back the regiment, of infantry formed massive squares upon the commnon, through the intervals of wbich the mounted troops re treated, and formed upon the'flanks ofthe squares to cover their retreat in ton 'In this anazner the greater portioa of the plains of Aldershost tvcre traversed, the Court and staff moving from height to height, and having a fnU view of every movement that took place. The infantry were deployed into line, and opened file firing, and a field battery .at sach end of the brigades contributed to swell the din; but the rexteat nevertheless weont on as rapidly as ever. so the spectators were left to suppose the advance of ,the enemy' was overwhelming. The ca?valr and Horse Artillery made a last desperate etTort to.retrieame:the fortunes of the day, and adeunced to the point in two magnificent lines, with the gunseu.either flank. After oneor two pro. paraDory wheels over the ground, as a lawk might turn before he stooped upon his prey, the 7th and 19th Hussars formed line and halted. The trumpets sounded the advance, and wi-h a dull jinglingsouud the line moved on fAster and faster, till the eharge rang out from every rank, and on they came, like a whirlwind over the plain, shaking the solid earth, and scattezing the turf like dust behind them. The grandeds and most terrible feature of real warfare was here portrayed with a fidelity which mado the very crowd seem awe-strickenajnd appolled. Hardly had the dust in the light cavalry track subsided when the manceuvre was repeated by the Dragoons, who swept the plain from end toend. As each charge was mads thbe mounted troops fell back further and further, until they finaUy retreated on the flanks of the infantry, who had deployed into line at WZe foot of some steep heights surmounted by the field batteries. Here the last desperate stand was made. A fierce file fire was opened, and every one of the 30 guns upon the ground was taxed to the utmost to keep up the cannonade. Not till all parts of the common were wrapped in smoke, and the whole scene as invisible to the Court as to the crowd, did the volleys cease. With this final effort the movements of the day wero brought to a close. ,Tho troopothen marched past Hvr Majesty and retnd to -Pp I 1yr1 Ylatyprooeeded to the Padvilon, ad after i. -ving part,.ken of lunch drove through the main avenieof the So-th and North Camps.

The Royal party artived at Farnborough station at 6 o'clock, whence the specisl train conveyed them back to town in 44 minutes.
HAYNABKEB THEATRE. Last night Mr. Bsckstone celebrated bis benefit by the production of a work which is not only styled a - comedy" in the bills, but has more of the comedy element aboat it than any piece that has been presented to the public for soee years. The author, Mr. Torn Taylor, has assembled together a number of characters that belong especially to the presentday, and, though his construction and grdand plan prove a study of recent French models, his work is aly originl, and the types he exhibits are thoroughly £thcconwedy is entitled Victims, and the first victim who. -isbrought forward is Mlrs. Merryweather (Miss Reynolds), a lady '1 delicate sasceptibilities, who largely patronizes literary and artistic " Eons," and laments that she is married to a plain city gentleman (Mr. Howe), who only earns money for her expenditure, without syn,pathi4ing withl her highaspirations. She has, however, a harmless conboling friend in the person cf Miss Crane tMrs. Poynter), a strongminded womian bent on the emancipation of her sex, and a -dangerous consoling friend in the person of Mr. Herbert Fitaherbert (Mr. W. lfarren), a Byronic-looking gentleman, who has earned a oonsiderable reputation as a poet, and bestows bouqzuts and sympathy on the fair sufferer. One of the bouquets, eent to Mrs. Merryweather throuch the medium of Mr. Fitzherbert's toady, Mr. Joshua Batterby (Mr. Buckstone), grievously interrupts the tranquillity of several persons, for Mr. blerryweather discovers in it a copy of verses, which convince him that the coet har'oours designs dangerous to his domestic peace, while Mirs Crane, supposing that Bntterby is the donor, and not merely the donor's agent breaks off au engageme.,t that she has contracted with the iuclkless toady. The heroine of the second act is a more genuine " victim " than the affected fine lady of the first. Tlhis is the wife of MIr. Fitzherbert, who, being his inferior by birth, keeps her situation so completely concealed that he passes everywhere for a single man, while she not only supports hiin by her needle and her musical talents, but meets his perpetual ill-humour with an unfading smile. On the delineation of this character the author has bestowed especial pains, and Miss Oliver, to whom it is intrusted, plays it not only with great care, but with much gonuine feeling. The discovery of the note in the boutquet, and the ownership of certain bUls of exchange accepted by the poet, induce Mr. Merryweather to visit his lodgings, when he is astonished to find an old flame, Lacy AiKin, who is the present Mrs. Fitzherbert. Mrs. Werryweather also comes to the same spot to engame Lucy Aikin, who retains her mnaiden name in the sight o? the world, to play on the piano at a grand party, little s8upecting that the humble musician is the wife of the brilliant poet. As the husband suspects the wife of isiting the man of genius, nd the wi£e, vwho has fuund a packet of old love-letters, suspects the husband of an i'trigue with the little pianist, a short fit of jealousy arises on beth sides, but mutual explanations sooa set matters right, and llr. and M~rs. Merryweather both resolve to befriend the devoted wife, A soir6e at the house of Mrs. Aferryweather that takes place in the third act presents an admirably drawn, tbhough, of course, highly coloured picture of a modern intellectual assemblage. Mrs. Merryweather's circle comprises not only the poet, the poet's toady, and the strongminded lady but also 3Mtr. Curdle, a Scotch politic.1 economist (Mr. Cullenford), Mr. Hornblower, of the "Weekly Beacon" (Mr. Braid), and Mr. Muddlemist, a mnetaphysician (Mfr. L. WFalter), who talks a jargon based on the language of Eegal. A question put by Mr. Rowley (Mr. Rogers), an honest city friend of Mr. Merryweather, as to the import of the word " .esthetics," causes several of these luminaries to ihine forth with great f,orce, and the arrival of a pair of " inxpressibles" for Miss Crane, instead of a handsome gown, presented as a peace-offering by the hapless Butterbg provokes a ruder sort of mirth. A more seriors tone is however, given to the assembly by the introduction of Mrs. Fitzherhert in her proper character. She has already been described by Mrs. hlerryweather as a perfect specimen of feminine devotion, and Fitzherbert, little suspecting who is the subject of the description, has been loudest in applause. The appearance of his wife at first excites his indignation, but this is soon changed to contrition, when lerryweatber returns to him the copy of verses, together 'with his acceptances cancelled. As for Mrs. Merr3weather she confesses that she has been deceived, having mistaken a generous husband for a sordid clod, and a selfish egotist for an ideal specimen of humanity. The description of the plot will convey but a faint notion of the merits of the piece. Every character is firmly and distinctly drawn, and, though here and there the incidents become somewhat farcical, there is nothing fatcical in the dialogue. Nearly the whole company is engaged in the representation, and last night all did their best towards the gereral effect. The succees of the work was fully commensurate with its merits. Each of the three acts terminated amid universal applause, and Mr. Taylor's name was proclaimed by Mr. Buckstone to be received with enthusiasm.
i TO THE EDITOR OE THE TIAES. I Sir,-I ian sorry that accident has prevented my sneing the debate of Friday last on the vote for the National Gal. lory until to-day. Will you permit me, thus late, to correct the statement made by Lord Elcho, that I offered to arrange Turner's pictures, or could have done so as well as Mr. Wornum I only offered to arrange the sketches, and that I am doing; but I never would have undertaken the pictures, which were in such a state of decay that I had given up many for lost, while, also, most of them belonged to periods of Tarnerg work with which I was little acquainted. Mr. Wornumr's patience and carefulness of research in discovering their subjects, dates of exhibition, and other points of interest connected with them have been of the greatest service; and it will be long before the labour and judgment which he has shown in compiling not only this, but all the various catalogues now used by the public at our galleries, will he at all justly appreciated, I find more real, serviceable, and trustworthy facts in one of these catalogues than in half a dozen of the common colleotions of lives of painters. Permit me to add further that during long residence in Venice I have carefuUy examined the Paul Veronese lately purchased by the Government. When I last saw it it was simply the bost Voronese in Italy, if not in Europe (the "M Marriage in Cana," of the Louvre, is larger and more magnificent, bat not so perfect in finish), and, for my own part, I should think no price too large for it; but, putting my own deep reverence for the painter wholly oat of the question, and considering the matter as it will appear to most persons at all acquainted with the real character and range of Venetian work, I believe the market valuie of the picture ought to be estimated as perhaps one-third more than the Government have paid for it. Without doabt the price of the 31urillo lately purchased at Paris was much enhanced by accidental competition; under ordinary circumstances, and putting both the pictures to a fair trial of market value, II beleve the Veronese to be worth at least double the Murilo; in an artistical point of view the latter picture could not be put in any kind of comparison whatever with the Veronese. I am. sir. vnir nW-f. --4 J. RUSKIN. I Oxford, July 7.

The sale lasted a fortnight and has realized a sum of 2,9021. As a wholo the library -wa scarcely worthy of so princely a residence, though it contained several good copies of valuable wdrks, some of which fetched but indifferent prices.

Every R>oyal Commission, every Parliamentary com. ntittee, and every leaing statesman who have considered the subject, have joined ia condemning the present diocesan courts, and it appears that the present officers thereof are to he the first officers of the local courts. It cannot, however, be maintained that as to grants under 1,500t. Iess care, legal knowledge, and practical skill are required than with respect to those above that sum. On the contra , the smaller grants are found to require more attention, the wills of persons in humble circumstances not being generally prepared with the care and legal supervision usualwith the vills of wealthy persons. Besides, the fding of the limitation at any arbitrary- kimount would lead to mnuch trouble and perple.xity in cases near the margin. Aight not the views of aU parties be reconciled by enacting that every &rant should be sealed in London, after inspection by the officials of the central court there ? 3upervision being thus secutred, the limitaton as to amount might ho s<afely withdrawn, with a reservation to the central court of sole jurisdiction as to grants embracing Government or East India stock, or railwawy shares payable As regards the proctors and their claim to compensation, the cheapest and best course for the public would be to leave to the proctors all their business after sweeping away the present foolish and mischievous restrictions to admission to their body, and to aRow all persons, whether attorneys or others, to practise as proctors after duly qualifying themselves by a proper term of service. Their business, however, as Dr. Lushington has wel observed, is too swall for divisi,on. If, therefore, the contentious part of it is to be taken from them it would be better to take all and give themn compensation. If the Legislature deem it advisable to admit at once to the profession the whole body of solicitors, 10,000 strong-at present the proctors' chents-the claim of the proctors to compensation seems to mettnanswerable, 1 am, Sir, yours most obedientlv. NERO.
THE NEW GOVBRNMfENT BUILDINGS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-A selection having been mede from the numerous drawings forwarded for the new lfar and other Govern. ment offices, I presume shortly it will be determined to erect these buldings, and if a precedent be made of the Westmineter Palace a commission or a committee will be appointed to determine the description of stone that shall be used for the constraction. I think all will admit that the stone chosen for the XNew Palace is a great mistake, for lonsince-in fact, before a portion of that material had beea exposed to the atmosphere more than seven years-any practised eye could see what would be the result. In proof of this I took occasion, in the early part of 1849, to write on the subject to your contemporary the Bulider, but the editor, either disregarding the observations of so humble an individual as myself, or perhaps not seeing the truth of the remarks, declined publshing my communication; but now it is found necessary to coat the building with a compound to prevent its destraction, and this before the builder has completed his work. My object in nriting you is to show that the Government may spare the labours of a conmmittee, inasmuch as they already possess a quarry of the finest building stone in the world, out of which they have on hand nearly or quite 150,000 tons of this materLal, with the power -of raising 500,000 tons more. I refer to the works at Portland. The breakwater there, no doubt you are aware, has been carried on with spirit for some time, and, unlike the 50 feet a-year at Dover, is really progressing with railway pace. In quarrying the material for the breakwater the qualty of the stone for finness being immaterial-in fact, the rougher and harder beds of the quarry being preferable -the Government have been able to set aside the large quantity of 150,000 tons of the most excellent stonetEe& 'the island Vroduocs, which is now lying in huge stacks in the bed of the quarry; It has been quite a fashion of late to raise an outcry against every act of basiness performed by the Government, but I would advise those so disposed to visit the vast works being carried on at Portland, mainly by convict labour, and I am confident they will change their opinion, for these works, both for extent and mode of perforruance, are superior to any private enterprise of a like description in the The co,t of removing from its present position and depositing on a wharf in London the 150,000 tons, or 2,400,000 cubic feet, already quarried, will be but Sd. per cnbic foot, while the cost of Anston stone, such as is being used for the New Palace, must bo nearly or quite 2s. per cubic foot. Then, again, the labour on Portland is only 4d. per foot supelcial, while that on Anston stone is Is. per foot superficial, thus effecting a savlng on the new buildings of 200 per cent. if Portland stone is ueed; and this large saving is in favour of a material proved by practice to be infinitelv superior to the mere costly article, in proof of which 1 need only refer you to Whitehall, the Horse Guards, Somerset House, St. Paul', and, in fact, to almost all the churches and public buildings in London, erected within the last three centuries, and, if my memory serves me, altso all the upper part of Old London-bridge was built of Portland stone. A statement may be made to the effect that all the stone belongimg to the Government in Portland will be required for the breakwater. To this I would answer thar, there are millions of tons of stone of the best deseciption for waterworks surrounding the Government quarries 'which is unfit for house building, and which can be had by the Government for taking avay; in fact,l think an arrangement has been made with Mes~so. Seewards, the extensive quarryowvners, for this purpoose I have little doubt* hut that the authorities are quite as weU aware of these facts as myself, but, fearingthis may not be the cawe, aud knowing that the proper eye will be directed to it if you think this letteroworth attentio, I have written, and beg to be, Sir, Your obedient servant.

RAILWAY INTELLIGEYCE. GREAT XOBTRERPN. A special general naeetingof this company was held yes. terday at th0 London Taverl, to eonsider a.B1ll for makiDg provision with respect to capital fraudulently created in the Great Nortterr and Eatst Lncolnehire Railwray companies, and for the purpoeo of considering arrangements for the interchange of traffic over the Great NWorthern andlan.- chester, Shefield, and LincolnshireRailway, asagreed bythe directors of the two companies respectively for mutual benefit- Mr. B. Dentson, n LP, in the chair. Mr. i. P MOVWATT, the secretary, having read the notice convening tho meeting, The CHAIRMAN explained that the Bill now before Parliament for making provision with respgct to Redpath!s.. frauds did not come under the Wharncliffe standing order, and therefore, on that account, need not be submitted to the shareholders for their approval; bat, as; he had promisedj rt tho general meeting in March last that it shouald be submi^tted, it was now beforo them for consideration and appro'val. Ho defended the courso adopted by the directors i with regard to the Bill. They were bound to act in accordance with the highest legal opinion they could obtain, and they felt that the matter mnst be dealt with by Parliament. Ak BiU having been prepared in accordance with the viewsr of the directors, stated in their report to the shareholders issued on the 4th of March, the Bill was submitted to Lord Rcdesdalo on the 7th of MIarch, who not only stated that lie would not consent to a Bili of that sort for increasing the capital of the comupany to cover the frauds of Rcdpath but insisted that they shouldpay, the expenses of replacing the fraudalent stock out of the revenue of the half-year. Lord Redeadailo had wzitten to that effect on the Bill. (Cries of "Read, read.") The Chairman then read the foUowing remarks of Lord Redesdale which were written on the margin of the first Bil submitted to him:- " No hid precedent must be sat in th9i c3se. The prilciple applicablo e, tho set'lement of this affair mu4t be held to Le the mme whether tto sum be lruge or smalU. It a clerk vas to run away with £0I0 the leesmut b ehargeod to the rpve=ee. and not to the capital of tnocom : al4 neow that A cleFk hAs swindled the company aut of £200 l,t lupedblo to Adu,lt a different principle in the settlenent, tiounah tr.en the dietrlen which would be oecasiosad by the atnauge,eut bein eowned oat upon the n5.t haif-yer's reaeipte, it ix reasonable to appl to Parliament for power to extend the time. There hmA bees nross neglect in the macsgement (cheern, or so srent a fraud could not have bocarSried onduring apericlot three rfouryears with. out detection nDn It would smear romo,able that the whole dividend, tpon the amount of stock held by every director neoessary to qualify umn for Snch offce sthoul(d be altogetber suspenuded and approPriated to the payments required to reOlaco the spritous capital during sock time aS may he allowod by Partament for such ,ettiement." (Cheers.) The Chairman, in reply to questions, acknowledged that he had these observations of Lord Redesdale's At the last meeting, but they were not in his possession when the report waa issued. He then entered into an explanation az to the reasons for altering the Bill to its present form, wvhich was done in accordance with the resolution of tho proprietors at the last half-yearly meeting auithorizing tho directors to apply the 243,9231. profits of tho past half-year towards making good the losse'i and exP;nses consequent upon the Redpath frauds; and it was arranged that any surplus, including the amount to be recovered froma the estate of Redpath, should be distributed as a dividend for the half-year ending December, 1856, to the holders of the preference stocks. Upon that occasion no objection was raised against the resolution by any of the preference shareholders, and tberefore it was the duty of the directors as trustees to carry it out in the best way they could. The resolution was pissed by a very large majority, there bing only nine or ten dissentients. It was observed by Mr. Kicholson that the preference shares were not guaranteed; they had only a priority of dividend during each year, and if there was nothing to divide they would not receive any dividend. The BiU as it now stood had been unanimously passed by a committee of five independent gentlemen in the House of Commons. The case of the preference shareholders had been most ably argued by their counsel before the committee, and after a patient hearing they passed the Bill without alteration. The preference sharebolders exercised their rights of speaking and voting at the meetings of the company in the same manner as did the ordinary shareholders. They participated in all the transactions of the company, and therefore after voting away the money they could not turn round and say they were guaranteed shareholders and mast havo their dividend. He then adverted to a number of abusive letters he had received from preference shareholders, and made some strong observations on the course adopted by Lord St. Leonard's and Lord Wenleydalce. in the House of Lords and elsewhere, in respect of the Bill, reflecting on the management of the directors. He concluded by moving a formal resolation approving the Bill, and ratifying any purcbases of stock made by the directors in accordance with the resolution of the last general meeting. Mr. PACKE seconded the motion. Mr. HEATH moved an amendment, to the effect that the directors be instructed, m promoting the Bill, to make such provision for the preference shareholders as would be in accordance with the 44th paragraph of the directors' report, and such extension of time for the payment as Parliament may sanction. (Cheers.) He contended that the preference sbareholders were creditors in respect of revenue, and stated that he perfectly agreed with the observations of Lord Redesdale, that it was reasonable to apply to Parliament to extend the time for providing fands out of revenue to replace Redpath's frauds, and not to take the whole out of one half-year, as proposed by the directors. (Hear, hear.) The whole of the preference claims was 82,0001. for the halfyear. Redpath's assets would realize 30,0001., and by taking something out of the half-year just expired the whole of the preference claims to the 31st of December last might be easily settled. - Mr. HAGGARTT seconded the amendmcent Mr. V. KNIGHT suggested that they should adopt some plan for a settlement of the dispute. *He thought, if the ordinary shareholders would pay two-thirds of the loss, and the preference shareholders one-third, that would meet the justice of the case. Mr. GREEN?SG contended that the ordinary shareholders should pay the debt they owed ro the preference shareholders. Mr. ScoTr remarked that by tho arrangement proposed by the directors the 44 per cent. preference shares would only receive !4 per eent. for the year 1856, while the unguaranteed stock would receive 3.J per cent. It was not worth while for the sake of a few thousands to damage their preference stock. and shake the confidence of the pablic in such stocks for the future. A long discussion ensued, in which fr. J. Wilson, M[r. Hghees, MIr. Waters, Mr. Melins, Mr. Craddock, Mr. Nicholson, Mr. Geisler, and other sbareholders took part, in tbe course of which it was stated that the accountant employed by the auditors to investigate the accounts of the company had been stopped by the committee of shareholders in consequence of the expensive way in which he was proceeding with the examination of the acecoants, the expenses of which now amounted to abovo 4,0001.; and, as only two stocks out of seven had been investigated, they coald form some Idea of what the expense would be. The books had been fully investigated by the clerks of the company during late hours, and the statement respecting the two stocks examined bythe accountant coincided with those prepared by the company's clerks. Mr. CRADDOCK contended that the directors were to blame with respect to Redpath's frauds, for if they had adopted such a system as that in operation at the London and North-Western the frauds wonld bave been detected immediately, or, at all events, within the first half-year. Mr. Alderman MEE,, one of the directors, was strongly in favour, as a matter of public policy, of protecting the interests of the preference shareholderg. The certificates of stock were now signedby Mr. Mowatt, the secretary, instead of bhving, as formerly, his name stamped on them by the refistrar. The CHAIRMA.\N then read the opinion of some of tho law officers of the Crown, with a viewto show they deemei it justandright that the loss should be borne by all the shareholders the preference as well as the unprotected share holders. On the amendment being put there appeared a small majority in favour of it, and a poU was demaanded, The CHAIRMAN then submitted tho agreement entered into between the directors of the C-reat Northern and 31anchaster, Sheffield, and Lincnlnshire companieS, an abstract of which has appeared in 27cc Tines. He stated that the agreement had been approved by the hoards of the two companies, and he could recommend it for their adoption, as he beheved it would be mutnally beneficihl. The object was to exchange their traffic st Retford. He concluded by roving a formal resolution approving the agreement, and authorizing the directors to carry it into effect. Mr. PACKE seoonded the motion. Mr. GRISLVP. strongly objected to the agreement, particularly the clause guarauteeing 10,0001. a-week to the Manchester Company. He concluded bh moving an amendment to the effect that clauses 5, 9, and 12 be omitted from the agreement. Mr. WATERS seconded the motion, believing that it wvould he very injurious, and that it was the first step towards an amalgamation of the two companies. Mr. HESSNAGE contended, as a large shareholder in the Manchester Company, that the guarantee was of no consequence, hecau.ce the trafficwould far exceed the amount stipulated. The CHAUN- explained that the traffic would be conveyed to an.from Refford and London by the Great Northern Company, .nd from Retford to Mancheeter by the Manchester Company; each companF would bring as much traffic as they could, and he believed the arrangement would be very beneficial. There was no intention whatever Of an amalgamnation. I The amendment was then put and negatived, and the resOlution was carried. Mr. GREENING gave notice of a motion for a vote of censure on the directors at the next meeting, in respect of the Redpath frautds. The meeting was then adjourned to 5 o'clock to recivothe report of the scrntineers on the poll demanded. At a quarter to 6 o'clock Mr. Malins, one of the scrutineers, reported that there were recorded in favour of the amendment 8,603 votes, representing 938,16914 stock in the company,and against it 22, 200 votes, representing 2,381,6711. stock in the company, the majority in favour of the chairman's motion being 13,597 votes, representing 1,443,5011. stock in the company. The CHAIRY?i& declaredtbat the amendment was lost and thot the original motion approving the Bill was carried. The meeting then separated. JM NCHESTER, SHUFFIELD, AND LINCOLNSHtRE. Yesterday a special meeting of this company was held at Manchester, to receive a report from the directors in refeence to the termination of the agreement of the 29th of July, 1854, with the London and North-Western Company, and to consider an agreement with the Great Northern Company. The report and traffic arrangement, an abstract of which has appeared in Tic TCimem, were taken as read. 3Mr. CKuraAu was in the chair. He stated that the first breach of agreement by the London and North-Western Company was that they did not put over the Sheffield lines all the traffic in their power. They were to develope the traffic of the Sheffield line, but had never given traffic to the amount of a pound under the agreement, contenting themselves with a money payment instead. The money naymentg they had received from the London and North-Western Company in the three years had been 37,000O, while their gam in traffic from this company which could have been sent over other lines had been O1,80Q, A4nothe; breah of ti4q graigement was the Iiva- Flon of this company's territory by the promotion of tho Stockport, Disey. and 'haley-bridge line on the part of the Lendon and North-Western, while the Sheffield Compwy had been strabning every nerve to serve the NorthWterzr. He explained the unfair way in -which they bad been treated by the London board, when tr*ing to bring about a settlement of arrears of account The London and North-Western had brQken the agreement from the commenioement, so that it was, an agreement no longer, and this company were therefore fully justified in the present course. ae concluded by moving a resolution approving the policy of the directors in reference to the London and North-Western Company. Mr. C. TURNInE seoonded the motion, which wa agreed to nnanimonsly. The CHAIRMAN next moved the confirmation of the terms of agreement entered into with the Great Northern Company. Mr. TuRmNZ seconded the motion. Mr. RoBsRTs expressed his regret at the severance of the allianco with the London and North-Western Company. Mr. NORTON exprewed great sAtisfaction that this coomr pany was at lst fn union with the Great Northern. The motion was carried unanimonsly. A formal resolution, approvinf a Bill to extend the Stock. rt and Whaley-bridge lno to Buxton, and to miake a line KIm Oldhann to Ashton and Guide-bridge was carried unanimously. On the motion of Mr. RonxnMTs, a vote of thanks to the directors for the devotion they had shown to the interests of the company was carried unanimowly. NORTH WESTERN. At a special meeting of this company, held at Leedg yesterdav, a Bill nows before Parliament, " to enable the NWorth-W~estern Railway Company to abandon a Eoxtion of their railwray, and to enter into arrangements woth other companies, and for other purposes with relation to the rail. way," on the motion of Mr. H.

THE FATAL ACOIDENT ON THE NORTH KENT RAI_WAY. Thomass Perry, 29. Edward Whiffeni, 24 (driver and firemen), and John Grifiths, 23 (sigtalman at the Blackheath staion, ereyeteray roghtupforreexaminatlionat the BGxeewinho Pheoflice-ouft, charged witneglect of duty, and cavsng te deths f 11persns ad serious injuries to Ithsd thatedence agist Grif.itbs, tbhe ignalman, should be first taken, the other prisoners were removed from the dock. Mfr. John Duncan Chapman, stationmaster at Blackheath, was recalled and examined by Mr. Rees. He said, I was on the platform on the arrival of the 9135 train from Strood on lunday night week. It arrived at 10-32 or 10-33. From the departure of that train tll the arrival of the 9-30 train from Strood I was on the platform exepting for about one or two minutes. Griffiths was in the signal-box the whole of the time. I received the signal from him to start both trains on their arrivaL The Blackheath signal-book produced contains the entries of the signals given and received at thieBlackheath station. The 930 train arrivedatthe Black. beath station aboutl1053. I started the traini, receiviing thesignaltodoso fromtbeprisonerGriffiths. Icalledout to bim, stnding about 15 or 16yardsfromhis box, "Is it all clear up?1"He replied, "All clear up, Sir." The trai:nthen left. About a mninute and a balf akfterwards I heard the. crash. I l do not believe it could have been heard by the prisoner In consequence of his box being in a confined = pTLa. ran back to the signal-box and said "For God's sake, Griffiths,wasthesignaln ght which YORgavemeforhi usst train?" He replied "m Yes, sir, it is entered in my book." Igave a momentary glance at his booki had nabeeve that the entries in the columin of the 9-15 train were filed up. I then looked at the dial, and found the signal from Lewisiato, "stop al up." That might be the signal for either train. It could not be the signal for the 930 train, unless the all clear up" signal bad been given from Lewisham for the 9-15 train. Suppesing the siogal given at 10-53 from Blackheath to Leawibam, as to the 9.30 train, had not been acknowledged by lewishami, the "atop all upb' signal must have been the signalof the 915 traino. In that case, and from the state of the dial when I saw it, it was evident hat the " all clear up" signal had not been received from Lewisham from the departilure of te 9.15 tra. Mr. John Nelson, stationmsster at Ie slhain, was called and said.-I was to duty at the iowi.ham station on the night of the 28th ofWiunef I was there on thie arrival of the 9-15 trin from Stroocd at 1040. In the ordinair course of thigs that traiu would not stop at our station. The reason of its stopping was that the indichatr at the ewisbam Junclon was at "ustop all fp. The$ s r phoro and distance signals were botho da st its paing the station. Upon its arrival it did not pas the distancee sigtlna,ut stoiped, and then came, between the sianals an~ stoDped.

Neither the semapbore nor distance signals, which were both at "danger," had been changed. Thie 9-30 train hatd precisely the same signaIs against it which had brought up the 9-15 train. The signalmian on duty that night was Wyld. Mr. T,eA.ThL said, he should formally commit the prisoner for trial by binding over the witnesses to attend and give evidence at the next Old Bailey sessons on a charge of manslauaghter; hut as the coroner's inquiry had not yet concluded, and In order to admit any new facts into the depositions which might presnt themselves, he would further remand he priso ner until Thursday week. bai. biltn applied that the prlsoner might be admittedl to Hr.

Several witnesses were examined ; their evidence, however, did not elicit any additional facts of importance. Mr. TRAILL said, it wouald be his duty to commit the prisoners for trial, as he had the signalman, on a charge of manslaughter, but they would be again brought up for formal evidence to be given as to the deaths which had occurred. The witmesses in the case were then bound over to give evidence at the next Central Criminal Court.
PAuErArs A&NnD THg POOR LAW.-The ninth annual report of the Poor Law Board (for the year 1856) has been printed in the form of a blue-book of 100 pages, with appendices, &c. In the year ended Lady-day, 1856, the sum of 6,004,244Z. was expended for the relief of the poor, being equivalent to an increase of 114,2031. as compared with the sum expended in the preceding year, or 1 9 per oent. The rate per head on the population was 6s. 3:d. The increase was distributed over the counties as followsviz., in Staffordshire. 9-7 per cent. ; in Nottinghamshire, 9 5 ; in ChesterS-5; in Leicestershire, 5-8; in Salop, 5-7 - in Bedfordshire. 5-6; in Middlesex, 54; in Anglesea, 5-1; in Lincashire, 4-8; in Yorkshire (West Riding), 45, in Pembrokeshire, 44: inRaduorshire, 44; in Derbyshire, 4 2; in Yorkshire (East) 440; in Herefordshire, 39 in Durham, 3-5; in Flintshire, 35; in Worcestershire 35-5 in Bnckinghamshire, 3-4; in Carnarvonshire, 34; in Vonmouth, 3-1; in Carmarthen, 2-8; in Merioneth, 2-8; in Cardi-an, 2-1; in Somerset, 2-1 ; in Rutland 1-7; in Devon, 1-5; in Glamorgim, 1-4; in Cornwal, 12 in Northumberland, 1-1; in Montgomery, 10 * in GloestI r 0-9; in Berks, 0'8: in Southampton, 0-8; in Oxford, 0-5 in Herts, 0-4; in Wilts. 0-2; in Northampton, 01; and in Surrey, 0u1 per cent.

An increase is also noticeable inthe number of persons receiving relief. Subsequent returns, however, indicate (as aIrenady.hown in2TchLmcs)aprogrosivo decrease in the num ber of paulors, and thecommassioners see grounds forexpecting that both the number of paupers and the amount of expenditure wll have a tendency to diminish. The average exmenditure of the 23 years occurring between 1834 and 1856 was 6d. 2d. per head on the estimated population, that in the year 1855-56 having been slightly above the average. The commissioners report that they have endeavoured ro avail themselves of everypracticableopportunityto promote the education of children in workhouses, and that their views have been sh-ired and acted upon by 3nanv boards of nuardians. The average number of children attending work. fouse sobools in the half-year ended at Lady-day, 1856, was 17,M6 boys Aizd 17,416 girls, and the average niumber of chitdren-attending district schools 1,488 boys and 1,284 girls. 28,6161. wastheamountpaidto boardsof guardiansout of the Parliamentary gant in respect of the saiaries of workhouse and district sa ool teachers in the year ended Lady-da, 1856; only 2U persons were assisted to emigrate during the year.

TO TH-P EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I find Mr. Roebuck, in bringing forward his motioi for the abolition of the Irish Viceroyalty, alluded to me, iamong others, as having voted in favourof a similar motioLn. I laU. I did not enter Parliament nntil 1852. A gentleman of the same name, late a member for Waterford, (for vwbom I hAve been very freqtently mistaken,). was then in Parliament, and I am told voted in the way suggested. This, no doubt, occasio4ed the mista}e, for the~ correction of whicb,as it appears ia your widely circulated. journal, I shall feel mueh obliged. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. HENRY S. REATING.

A FRtmzCH BuRGARy.-The Court of Assizes of the Haute-Garonne has just beenoccupied two days intrying eight men for burglary and six women for complicity in the same. It appeared that a very old gentleman, namedMontauriol, resides in a large house called Chitean des, Bastard, in the commune of Mongiscad, and has all his life; been accustomed to -keep -a large part of his fortane, which is in specie and banknotes, in his house. The male prisoners, all worthless characters, of the adjacent illage of Montesqmeu, forned the project of breaking into the hoawand stea ing the money. Accordingly, in the night of the 25th of September last they went to the chateau, carryinug with them several sacks which they proposed to fill with the money, and also taling a horse to carry their booty away. To effect an entrance they began cutting a hole in the outer wal, but the dogs barked so fhriouslv that they deemed it pruaent to-tilke to flight, Two or three nights atter they renewed the attempt, but for the saae reason it failed. At lengtb, in the night of the 1st of December they went to the house, and while some kept watch around it the othere made a hole in the wall which enabled them to undo the fastenings of a door. They then entered and ascended to the room in which old 1L Montauriol was sleeping. Mls female servant, who was the only person inthe house besides himself, hearing a noise, came from her room, but the men pushed her back into it, and fastened the door. The .ld man having been roused uttered loud cries, and one of the burglars, dragging him from the bed, told him that they were 20 in number, and that they would murder him if be stirred; but he continued to cry out, and they beat him violently about the head until he was silent. They then went into the room. in which the money was kept, and breaking open a cupboard proceeded to fill their sackswith money. Rleanwhile4, the female servant, opening her Wiadow, gave the alanm. Some farm labourers, in the service of Mauntauriol, hearing the cries hurried to the chCtteau; and on their approach the burglars took to flight, carrying with them the money which they had collected. They afterwards divided the booty in different proportions according to the share each had had in the burglary. As to the women, who were wives of six of the men, they also received portiGon of the stolen money. On some of the burglars being arrested, one of them made fun revelations respecting the whole affar. The precse amount which was stolen was not known by o. Montauriol, but the prisoners themselves confessed that tas 35,835f. The jury acquitted the six women and one of the men, who was very old, and convicted the other seven prisoners- The Court condemned them to periods of hard labour, varying from six to 20 years. In the course of the trial it was stated that the sum El Montauriol ws accustomed to keep in his house was not less than 1,00,000f. of which about 100,000f. were in gold, 100,OOOf. in bank notes, and the rest in silver. It was also stated that his total fortune is about 2,000,000f., andthat he miade it by speculations in houses, lands, and corn but that, notwithstanding his wealth, he lived in the most miserly manner, and was gtatedifor aany years not to have eaten meat ox game. The old man, who was called as a witness, is perfectly blind, but he proved to the court that he could byg the mere toech tell one barnuotefrom another.-GatignanP'-X Messenger. PuBLIc DRINK G FouNrAiNs.-Who has not, at some time or other, in traversing the streetsof a largetown, longed for a draught of water. Yet nothing is, ordinnily, so diffcult to obtain. There are the greatest facilities for Tlurchasing everything which will heat the already heated bIodancl increase the thirst already suffered there are certain cooling drinks which maybe had for money, though not readily; bat the great natural provision for thirst can scarcely be had at alL The weary wanderer, who has hardly the means of procuring food, and the many poor children whom various causes send into our streets, suffer unrelieved; nor should what the animals kept for our con-- venience endure, be overlooked. In some towns, here and there, the stone troughs and iron bowl by which past generations rendered some old sprlng available to the wayfarer and to the worlkman may yet be seen. In others more modern contrivanoes have been adopted. As Dopulation increases there is the more need for the extension of so ex- celent a system. The subjoined extracts show -what bs, been done in some places. In the metropolis there am several instances of the same benevolent provision. Weheartily recommend to our townsmen the imitation of these laudable examplcs, believing that a sufficient subscription for the erection of public drinking fountais ia Leeds would be readily obtained. The Liesrpool Ycar Boo says :-" One of the most spirited and practical efforts ever made to increase our local sanitary app iauces has emanats!l from a private individual, Mr. C. P. Mlly, of this town. Since March, 1854, Mr. Melly has erected at his own coot numerous drinking fountains in different parts of the towno which afford a constant supply of pure and refreshing wakr to the thirsty wayfarer. The first fountain was erected en the 3lst of March, 1854, at the south end of Prince's Dock it was of polished Aberdeen granite. In the course of thsame year six small cast-iron fountains were erected ahlg the north end of the dock property. The cost of thaseelatter was, to a certain degree, refunded by the Towncouncil, who promised to erect several more, and to rmantain a good supply of water to all. In neither respect did they fuilltheir promises: and, in the commencement oftse, past year (18K56), Mr. Kelly, despairing of seeing the numberof fountains increased by the Town-council, and fiuding from statistics that their usefulness far exceeded his mostL sanguine expectations, again commenced erecting some new ones at his, own expense. Mr. M'Donnell, of Aberdees, seconded him, by offering to furnish polished granite fountains, according to Mr. MIelly's de6ign, at'prime cost, with out profit to himself; aind we have theplesure to annoucr that 14 polished drinking fountains have been erected is the course of the year, Each fountain has two galvanized. iron ladles attached by light chains to the waU on e side, and is ornamented with a handsome bronze hesdof hon, boy, satyr, or other design, furnished by Messen er and Sons, of lirminghail On the 6th and 7th oT J, the number drinkdng at different fountUs along the southL end ofthe docks exceeded 2,500 personsLper day at wch-. The Britisk Workman adds,-" We are glad to learn th5t Birkenhead and R.uncorn are followinr the goocl exampleof Liverpool and we trust that in L,ondon and many Other places gentlemen will hoe found with hearts as large and! purses as heavy as Mr. Melly's, by wzhom water for 'the peopl will ho prvidcedcbry nean6 of these public drinbinZ
