MONIL-MARRT and CITYINTEBLUiGENCB. Saturday Evening. The statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that there is a mu-plus of 2,860,0001. in the Treasury, of which 650,0001. will remaia after paying the cost of the Persian war and providing for the redemption of the Sound Dues, the operations at present contemplated in China, the increase in the navy, &F., caused the funds to open with buoyancy this morning at a further improvement of an eighth, and to show increased animation before the close of busness. The augmentation presented in the Bank bullion, notwithstanding the large amount of coin disbursed in payment of the dividends, likewise tended to support the market. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 91i to i, were first quoted 91i to J. They soon advanced to 911 to J, and were well maintained throughout the remainder of the day. For the 6th of August the last price was 92 to i. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 2154; Reduced, 91i to 92 ; New Three per Cents., 92 to i; India Stock, 216 to 217i; India-bonds, 16s. to 10i. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. In the Stock Exchange to-day the supply of money was beyond the demand, and short loans were made at very low rates. In the discountmarket there was also considerable ease, and at the Bank the applications were few. The transactions in foreign securities have been limited, but prices showed a tendency to advance. Turkish closed J per cent. better than the final quotation of yesterday. Brazilian Five per Cents. have been negotiated at 101 to 101i; Danish Five per Cents., 101 ; Mexican, for the account, 22 ; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 801, 81i; Russian Five per Cents., 1091; Spanish, for the account, 40i; the New Deferred, 25i; Passive, 5a; and the Certificates, 51; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 95k, -; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account 102i; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 64. The anticipation recently expressed that the decline on the Paris Bourse would be found to have reached its limit seems in course of fulfilment. The Rentes to-day show another advance of a quarter per cent., the final transactions in the Three For Cents. being at 67f. 30c. for money, and 67f. 35c. for the end of the month. The specie from, New York to-day is 186,0001.. and the remittances henceforth seem likely to diminish, a considerable decline having taken plac 3 in the rate of exchange. The downward course of the stock-market had at length been arrested, and in many descriptions of railway securities the rebound was equal to 5 or 6 per cent. New York Central had advanced from 77 to 83; Reading, from 672 to 74k; and Erie, from 27 to 28. Illinois Central were quoted 116 to 117 ex the new shares, which is equal to another recovery of 1 or 2 per cent. The chief cause of the improvement consisted in the fact of the duty payments on the 1st of July under the new tariff having created much less inconvenience than had been anticipated by the speculators. The loss of nearly 400,0001. specie, shown in the bank returns of the preceding week, had been fuUy recovered. A continuance of wet weather had been experienced, and the circumstance of two days having, passed without rain before the departure of the present packet is mentioned as a subject of congratulation. The prospects of the harvest, and especially of the Indian corn crop, which is one of the most important, appeared rather uncertain. Everything was unusually backward, but with improved weather a good yield in most cases was still possible. The trafflo on most of the railway lines continued to contrast unfavourably with the corresponding period of last year. To the great dissatisfaction of the population of the Northern and Western States the southern route had been selected for the new overland mail service to California. An Act of the New York Legislature abolishing days of grace on bills of exchange had come into operation on the 1st of July. Afterl7 years' litigation the important case of certain English bondholders, represented by Messrs. Palmer, Mackillop, and Co., against the North American Trust and Banking Company, had been decided in the New York Court of Appeals in favour of the English claimants. The sum involved was more than 300,0001. The case had never been one to admit either of legal or moral doubt, and the way in which it was contested and carried from court to court by the parties interested in t.e repudiation of the claim has often been cited as a warning to investors in American securities. The proceedings of railway companies during the week have been as follows :-A Bill to extend the Staines and Wokingham line to the Great Western at Reading has been approved by the shareholders of the London and South-Western. At a meetiug of the OswestryandNewtown the report was slightly amended and adopted. It was resolved b-y a majority of votes that aU contracts of works awith Messrs. Thornton and MrXM`Cormick be abandoned, the directors who signed the agreement with them being indemnified. Other resolutions were passed authorizing the completion of the contract with Mr. Davison to construct the line. At a large meeting of railway directors it was determined to oppose the Bill for making further provision for the conveyance of mails. A Bill for a branch line from Portpatrick to Castle Douglas of the British and Irish Grand Junction bas been approved at meetings of the London and North-Western, Caledonian, and Glasg'ow and South-Western. The accounts of the London and Greenwich show a balance of 11,3191., and a dividend of 5s. 3d. per share has been declared. In the report of the directors of the Grand Trimk of Canada it is stated that the line is now opened for 849 miles. Large additions to the rolling stock are in course of supply, and an increase of 2,000,0001. to the capital will be proposed in August, 500,0001. of which will be in substitution of certain debentures issued last year. Arrangements are in progress which it is hoped will add largely to the revenue. The receipts on capital account up to the 31st of December, 1856, amounted to 7,727,4301., and the balance of revenue over expenditure was 26,9831. The Bill authorizing the NorthWestern to abandon a portion of their railwvay, and sell or lease their undertaking to the Midland, has been approved at a meeting of the shareholders of the latter company. A dividend has been declared of 10s. on the ordinary stock of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire, being at the rate of 1 per cent, per annum. Under the agreement with the Great Northern, traffic between Manchester and places west of Manchester will be worked continuously to and from London from the 1st of August. Bills for the construction of branch lines have been approved at meetings of the Caledonian and Rhymney companies. The directors of the London and North-Western have issued a statement in reply to the allegations of the Manchester, Sheffield, and LincoInshire with reference to the breaking off of the aIreement lately subsisting between the two companies. In this they charge the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Company with having broken the agreement upon false pretences, at a time when, after having enjoyed its greatest benefits for a series of years, its operation was becoming less one-sided. The directors of the London and Brighton have recommended a dividend of 21. 10s. for the past half-year, and the Ceylon Company have notified that the colonial guarantee of 6 per cent., approved by the Home Government, will take effect from the 7th inst. With reference to the ravages of the yellow fever at St. Thomas's, and the impression that it is generated by the peculiar situation of the coaling depot, it is understood that the Royal Mail Steam Company on the 2d of the present month sent out orders for other premises to be taken. The precise amount of the specie shipped by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Indus is 540,811'., of which 326,6351. is silver for India, and 214,1761. for China and the Straits. The only gold is 1,5001. The Patbie reports the total loss of the French ship of war Newton in the new harbour of Port-auChoix, Newfoundland. A statement was given yesterday of the duty paid during the past year by each of the fire insurance offices, arranged in the order of their respective amounts. Subjoined is a similar statement, compiled jfrom the Parliamentary return, of the sums insured at each office on farming stock, which is exempt from duty IJnder thiF head the totsl inaed by London offices are as follows, the aggregate amoint of property protected being 39,467,8411.:- VALUE OF FARMNIG STOCK (EXXhlPT FROm DUTY) INSURD BY IONDON OFFCES.

The following information regarding the mining business of the wreek is ex;tracted from the Minin7g Joua'na :a "Money has been easier during the week, and tho mining -market quite as active as we could reasonably expect under aUl circumstances. At East Wheal Falmouth meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of mine of 6581. - a dividend of 2561. (2s. 6d. per share) was declared.

At the Duke of Cornwal Mine meeting the accounts showed a balance against the mine of 2,6467. The Sortridge and Bedford Mining Com. pany resolved to sell off and close the accounts, having ex. *pended upwards of 7,0001. without any result." The Clarendon (Jamaica) Mining Company have issued their report preparatory to a meeting on the 22d. It states that Mr. Tregoning, who was lately sent to examine the mine, recommends that it should be tried in depth by a new 70 fathom shaft, which would cost 19,2001. in sinking, and occupy four years. The cash in hand is only 5,0371. Whether the directors intend to make a call or there is any prospect of returns meanwhile from the ordinary workings of the mine is not stated. According to the accounts yesterday by the West India mail the ore had greatly improved, and the lode was npwards of 12 feet wide, but as the 10s. shares are still saleable only at 2s. 6d. it is to be presumed no importance is attached to these announcements. The Forest Queen has arrived from China with 1,065,1001b. of tea and 153 bales of silk. The half-yearly dividend upon the Five per Cent. Guatemala debt is advertised to be paid the 1st of August next by Messrs. Isaac and Samuel.
RAILWAY INTBLLIGENCE. TAONT)Cbfl RRTrRTFTOV ANT) .nTVT'T ilAAQT The report of the directors of this company states that the capital raised to the 30th of June amounted to 7,797,2151., consisting of mortgage debt 1,912,9351., debenture stock 1,0001., preference capital 1,234,7261., and consolidated stock 4,618,5541. The total outlay on capital account during the past half-year has been 6,52:31. The pincipal part of this sum has been expended in the completion of the telegraph, which now extends over every part of the company's lines, and in the construction of works, &a., necessarv for the accommodation of the public. The amount of unexpended capital at this date belng only 1,068S., and there being several works which cannot longer be delayed without injury to the traffic, the directors feel it their daty to call upon the shareholders to sanction an application to Parliament for powers to raise a further sum of 200,0301. The directors wiU take care that no part of the amount is expended without the prospect of a satisfactory return; in the meantime they do not anticipate that any large portion will be immediately required. The gross revenue for the half-year ending the 30th of June has been 349,224L, showing an increase of 6,5461. over the corresponding half-year of 1856, which included a very large revenue derived from the naval review at Spithead, the peace festivities, &c. The re prt states that there is every reason to believe that the West-end line wil be completed to the river side by the end of theyear, and, judgingfromthe mannerinwhich thelocaltraffic thusfar has developed itself, the directors look forward with confidence to the realization of their expectations as regards that line of railway. The number of train miles ran during the half-year was 955,948, against 924,385 at the corresponding period; the recoeipts, exclasive of cartage, amounted to 337,7821., and for the corresponding period of 1856 to 332,0321.; and the expenses to 154,5121., against 149,0431. at the corresponding period. The expenses, including cartage, amounted to 161,6421., and for the corresponding period of 1856 to 155,794. The ordinary expenses amounted to 138,9011., and the renewals and additions to 15,611n., while in the corresponding half-year of 1856 the expenses amounted to 129,5561., and the renewals to 19,4781. The cost per train mile was 3s. 2-1d. against 3s. 21d., and the expense of cartage to 7,1301. against 6,7G01. The increase of ordinary expenses as compared with those of the corresponding period of 1856 arises from the expenses of working the West-end line now appearing for the first time, from the high price of materials, and from the rolling stock having been extensively and thoroughly repaired. The fine weather which prevailed during the past half-year enabled the directors to proceed rapidlywith the relaying; accordingly, 13.J mUes have been completed, and there now remain ten miles ts finish the main line throughout. This work is prowessing, and will be executed before the end of the year. o whole of this outlay is to be borne by revenue, which has been again debited with 3,0001., being the proportion due to the past half-year. The attention of the directors has been heavily taxed during the current session of Parliament by the introduction of Bils affecting the interests of the company. The only Bil which the directors were not successful in opposing is one for a new line to Epsom, starting from the South-Western line between Wimbledon and MIaldon. This Bill was granted, although it was clearly shown to be a competing line which had prevlously been rejected by Parliament, not only when this company's Epsom line was originaly grauted, but also in a subsequent session. The directors are, however, glad to perceive a general determination on the part of the committees of tho House of Commons to adopt at last the policy so clearly ointed out by the select committees presided ovsr yMr. Gladstone and hr. Cardwell, who wisely recommended Parliament not to allow money to be wasted in the constraction of duplicate lines, inasmuch as competition in railways can only result In injury to the pubhÂ¢ as wel as to the shareholders. The departure in this instance from the principle acted upon in other cases can only be attributed by the directors to the little importance attached by parliament to a small line of about five miles in length. The net amount at the credit of the revenue account for the half-year is 115,9271., out of which the directors recommend the payment of a dividend of 2A per cent. for the half-year, amounting to 115,4641., leaving a balance of 4631. The report of Mr. J. Reeves and Mr. J. Chapman, the auditors, states that the mortgage debt has increased by the sum of 36,8001., borrowed partly at 4t and partly at 4.1 per cent. The permanent way improvement account has also been increased by the amount of 15,6441., 3,0007. of which has been placed to the debit of the revenue account for the past half-year. TRAFFIC RETURNS.

THE UNITED STATES. (vaorO OUR OWN CORlESrONDEN'T-1 NEW YORK, JULY 8. The Court of Appeals of the State of New York adjourned on the 3d inst., after making two of the most important decisions ever made by an American bench. One, that establishing the constitutionality ,of the new police law for the government of this city, I wrote you of by the last post; the other, which relates to the long-pending litigation concerning the property of the North American Trust and Banldng Company, has more interest for English readers. The facts concerning these cases are briefly these *-In 1838, a season of great commercial embarrassment following the speculations of 1835, a bank was established in New York caUed the North American Trust and Banking Company. Its capital, unluckily, was not a moneyed one, but consisted o& bonds and mortgages, utnconvertible at once into =uoney, but, astheeventhas shown, substantiaUygoo I securities. This company had commercial dealings with the well-known London houise, Messrs. Palmer, 31'Killop, Dent, and Co., who generously and efficiently assisted the bank in their efforts to convert their capital. The company, though without the knowledge of Messrs. Palmer and Co., dealt largely in State stocks, and, in the most disingenuous manner, continued to procure large advances from that fir n. The general failure of the Western and Southern States to pay their interest caused the company at length to stop payment in August, 1841. Previous to the failure of the company, and 'while still in credit, in the winter of 1840, the comnpany executed bonds to the amount of about $1,000,W00, ancd transferred various bonds and mort gages to the trustees as security for their payment. This was called the "Million Trust." InApril, 1840, a similar transaction took place, and bonds to the szmount of $500,000 were issued, and secured by a trust deed, called the "Half-mijlion Trust." The bonds in these trusts were taken by English purchasers. Another trust deedwas madeforthe benefit *of American creditors, and among them of the United States' Bank. These trust deeds have been the subject of litigation unparalleled in the Americana ourts. For 15 years the receiver of the bank and his counsel have exhausted all the powers of the law in resisting and obstructiDg the execution of the truTst. At length the cases were brought to a hearing before the Supreme Court of NewYork, and the trusts were affirmed. The cases were taken thence to the Court of Appeals, where they were arrgued in January last by eight counsel. The Court held two sessions a-day, and the arguments consumed an entire month. The pleadings and proofs were of monstrous mnagnitude, and the arguments snore full and learned than in any case ever argued before the bench of New York. The decision rendered on the 3d inst. fully establishes the validity -of the trusts. The following are the resolutions of the Court upon the points discussed before them, arid the judgment in accordance " RESOLUT'IONS. "1. The million and half-million trusts sanctioned in the 1leadings and proof are not void under the 8th section of the statute I to prevrent the insolvency of mioneyed corpora. ionas.' (I It. S. 591.) 2. The said trusts are not void under the 9th section of the said statute, it being the opinion of the Court that thBy were not niade with intent to give a preference to particular creditors over other creditors. "3. The trusts are not void under the statute (2 R. S. 135, sec. 1), on the around that they were made for the use of the North A uerican Trust and Banking Company, it being tho opinon of the Court that the statute applies on'ly to con'veyances, &G., primarily for the use of the grantor, and not to instruinents for other and active purposes, where the reservations to the grantor are incidentat and partiaL " 4. The said trusts were not made with iutent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, arnd therefore they are not void on that ground. s5. Nhe North American Trust and Banking Company 'sd power to borrowmoney, andprior tothe 3dday of aine, 1840, baLking associations could lawfully issue time paper to secure a debt for moneys loaned, with or without the corporate seal, provided such paper was not intended or cal. cnulated to circulate as money, and the trust bonds in the Swo trusts were not of a description falling within this prowino. "0. Prior to the said 3d of June, 1840, the said trtust jhonds were issued and pledged to Palmer, MlKillop, Dent and Co., in London, to secure their debb and future ad. vances, with powver to sell the same according to the original design of the trust. Such pledge was valid, and it entitles the Palmers, &c., still holding 377 of the million and 180 of the half million bonds, under the same, to the benefit of the two trusts, along with other bondholders. " 7. The said bonds when so issued and pledged, and when portions of the same were sold, were Enghsh contracts, and the loans or advances procured on the sale of 499 of them ibelonging to the nillion trust were not usurious by the then existing law of England, being oxempted from the usury lawss of that country by statute of 2d and 3d of Victoria, chap. 37. " 8. Even if said loans upon the 499 bonds were usurious, -the appellant, as receiver, representing as he does the cor.poration, is prohibited by the statute of this State, passed in 1850, chap,. 172, from setting up the usury in these cases in any stage thereof. -' 9. The holders of the said 499 bonds are thereforo entitled to share in the benefi of the mirlon trust. " 10. The loan nominally of $2i50,000 procured from the 1'hiladelphia banks was a Pennsylvania contract, and although it may bave been usurious, nevertheless by the law of that State the contract was imperative only for tho excess of interest over 6 per cent., the lawful interest. 11. The pledge of the 270 half-million bonds to said banks was valid, although the 12 certificates of deposit, amounting to $250,00fl, issued by said company were probibited by tho 3tatute of May 14th, 1810, which took effect June 3d, 1810, It being the oDinion of the Court that the inteotion and legal effect of tlhe pledge were to secure the payment of the .money loaned, and it being also the opinion of the Court that the alleged voidness of the certificates of deposit issued for the rt payment of said loans doea not affect anything else In the comtract. "12. ThI eassignees of the said Philadelphia banks have 'therefore a ri6ht to share in the benefit of the half-million trust, as holders of the said 270 bonds. "'13. ''lTe Messrs. liolfords and Co. have a right to a 3hare in the million trust as pledges and holders of 24 of the bonds in that trust. "14. The general account of Palner, M'Killop, Dent, and Co. against the North American Trust and Ban;king Coinpany, including the advances mnade bv tlhom to take up the Davis bills, so called, constitutes a legal and valid debt, to ibe reduced, however, by computing interest at five per cent. only, instead of seven per cent., and by striking out the ccmisssioils on the sale of so many of the million bonds as they themstlYes purchased.

" Ordered, further, that the said judgments or deoree of the Supreme Court, except as herein modified, be affirmed ; but the Court not intending in this affirnance to establish that the 1,350 trust bonds were sealed obligationis according to the laws of the State of New Yoresk as declared in said *decree; or that either of the trust deeds were made in virtue of, or authorized, in fact, by any previous resolution of the board of directors of the North American Trust and anking Cornmpany, as also declared in said decree. "Ordered, further, that the taxable costs and counsels' lees of the respondents, the trustees Blatchford and others, efirtpid out of the fuds embraced in the two trusts mentioned in theipleadinga and judg:nent in this cause; that the taxable costs of the other respondents be next paid out sof the Cainle fundsa, and that aSter said costs and counsels' fees 01 I ti 1 tUACCs, an said taxable ce3ts-o-f -th-e o_t_he_rr`ospon-a dents are paid, and the clains of the bondholders are satisfied, then that the taxable coats, disbursements, and counsels' iees, on thi; appeal of the appellant, the receiver, be paid ORt of the same fund as aforesaid. If said funds are in- 6ufficient to pay said costs and counsel's fees of the trastees, 2and the taxablo costs of the other respondents, and the claims of the bondholders, then a sum equal to the taxable costs of aU the respondeists is to be paid to the special rcceiver by the said appellant, for the benefit of the bondholders, out of any funds in his hands, or which may come to his hands as receiver, after satisfying, however, any allowances which may be made to hin by competent authority, out of such funds for his said costs and conasels' fees. " Ordered, further, that the decree to be entered hereon ba aettled and approved by Judge Comstock." The celebration of the anniversary of the Declara- Eon of Independence was varied this year by a dis:graceful riot, the details of which continue to fill the morning journals. There is in the Sixth Ward, which may be called the \Vhitechapel or St. Giles's district of New York, a club of young ruffians-not to call them by a worse term-known as the Dead Rabbit Club. There has long been a feud between them and what are known as the Bowery Boys. The ild police organization wa*s disbanded on Friday, the day before the celebration, the new was not yet aufficiently organized, and these-people took advantage of the inte-egrnam to have a pitched battle. a'l flowcriev b oldly charged into the midst of the Dead Rabbits, who received thern pistols and muskets in hand. Double-barreled guns were at a premium; and one of the combatants, more fortunate than the others, brought up a howitzer fcr service, but it was ignominiously captured before it could be got into action. Barricades were formed across the streets. Woman lent more than the iafluence of her presence to cneer the combatants. From the surrounding housetops the negro and Irish wenches hurled bricks and chimney tops indiscriminately below. The police foolishly interfered to prevent a successful termination of the Eilkenuny cat game and were driven back. Three regiments were called out, two armed with the Mini6 rifle, and twelve rounds to a man. The display stopped the riot without further bloodshed. The hospitals are filled with the wounded. A medical friend who has had a good deal of experience in Paris told me that he had never seen so nmany gunEhot wounds at one time. While these pleasant things were going on in New York the country was startled by the telegraphic news of the death of Mr. Marcy, at Ballston, from disease of the heart. He retired to his room on the morning of the 4th, complaining of feeling a little unwell, and when caled an hour after was found sitting upright in his chair, dead. By his death the coulntry loses its ablest statesmuan, and the Democratic party one of its wisest and most conservative political minds.

THBX CAPE OF GOOD ROPE. PLYMOUTH, SA'TURDAY. Hor Majesty's sloop Frolic, 6, Commander L. W. Peyton, from Table Bay, May 14, arrived this moruing. It was reported at Cape Town that Protorioum with 500 men had crossed the Orange River frontier to claim certain lands hold by the chief Boahoph. The German Legion, with full pay, are settling on their several allotments, and Berlin, Potsdam, and other con. tinental cities are speedily obtaining village namesakes in South Africa. East London is quiet, and the head-quarters of the 89th are removed therefrom to Cape Town; that regiment is reliev. ing the 7Sd at Fort Pato, Murray, Grey, &8c. A new and shorter road to IKing William's Town is in course of formation, and forts Jackson, Ameline, &c., are ereoting on various favourable points. The Castor, 6, flag of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Sir F. W. Grey, K.C.B., and the paddlowheel steam sloop Hermes, 6, Commander William E. A. Gordon, were at Simnon's Bay. The steam frigate Penelope, 16, Captain Sir William S. Wiseman, was at Table Bay. The steam sloop Geyser, 6, Commander Arthur Tower, was on a survoy. The Frolic spoke, May 31, off St. Helena, the paddle wheel steam sloop Scourge, 6, flag of Sir John Adams, Commodore of the West Coast of Africa, and, July 17, off the Lizard, under topsails, the Boscawen, 78, Captain Richard A. Powell, from Plymonth for the Cape of Good Hope. The Frolic was commissIoned in 1853, and has been con. stantly employed on the Cape station. She was engaged a fortnight in a frnitless effort to discover some remnants of the lost brig Nerbudda.
EXTRAORDINARY PHEN-riOMENON.-ThO following letter from the Hon. Charles Augustus Murray, Her -Majesty's Envoy to Persia, has been handed to us for publi:tion by Sir Charles Lyell:-" Bagdad, May 23, 1857. Uy dear Sir Charles,-We have lately witnessed here a phinolnenon so strange that a brief description of it may not be uninteresting to you. On the 20th inst., a few minutes before 6 p.m. (which is here about an hour before ourset), I was sitting with my irrza reading sooje Persian letters, xvhen on a sudden I became sensible of an unusual obscuration of the light on the paper; I jumped up, and, going to the window, saw a huge black clond approaching from the north-west, exactly as if a pall were beingc drawn over the face of tho heaverns. lt must have travelled with considerable rapidity, for in less than three minutes we were enveloped in total darkness-a darkness more intense than an ordinary midnight when neither stars nor moon are visible. Groping my way amid chairs and tables, I succeeded in striking a light, and then, feeling assured that a simoomi of some kind was coming on, I called to my servants to conme up and shut the windows, which were al open, the weather having been previously very sultry. While they Yoere doiDg so the wind increased, and bore with it such a dense volume of dust or sand that before they could succeed in closing the windows the room was entirely filled, so that 11-c tables and furnitare were speedily covered. Meanv,hile a panic seized the whole city; the Armenians snd other Christian sects rushed tbrough the gloom to crnfess and pray in the churches; women shrieked. ai.d beat their breasts in the streets; and the men of al classes prostrated themselves in prayer, believing that the end of the world had arrived. After a short time the black darkness was succeeded by a red lurid gloom, such asInever saw in any part of the world, and which I can only liken in imagination to the eflect that might be produced if aU London were in conflagration in a heavy November fog; to nme it was more striking (I may almost say fearful) than the previons utter darkness, and reminded me of that ' darkness visible' in which the poetic genius of Milton placed the aemons and horrid shapes of the infernal regions. This lurid fog was doubtless occasioned by the rays of the western sun shining obliquely on the dense mass of red sand or dust which had been raised from some distant desert, and was borne along upon the blast. I enclose you, a specimen of the dust. The Arabs here think that it camne from the Nejd. The storm seems to have travelled in a circular direction, having appeared first from the south then south-west, then west, then north. west. After abont two hours it had so far passed away that we were able to open the windows again and breathe the outer air. It cannot have been a simoom, for during those which I have experienced in Arabia and Egypt the wind is hot and stifling. On the 20th the wind was igh, but only oppressive from the dense mass of dust that it carried with it."-Professor J. Quekett, of the Royal College of Surgeons, having kindly examined the specimen of red dust from Bagdad which accomiipanied Mr. MIurray's letter, has inforined Sir Charles Lyell that he could detect, under the microscope, only inorganic particles, such as quartz-sand, in the dust. There are no relics of Diatomace;e apparent; and, thorgh a small portion of calcar eois matter was present in the sand, yet be could observe no microscopic shells or other organio matter,-Literary Gazette.
B ER MATJESTY, YISIT TO ALDEBSHOTT. The military evolutions at sh1e Camp in honour of the Court visit were resumed on Sa6turday morning, and continued for some hours, til almost all the manoeuvres of which horse and foot, skirmishers andi.artillery, were capable of performing had been entirely gone thb:ough. There was an unusuly brilliant and nua'erous attend. ance of field-officers on this occasion, but the number o' civilian visitors from the metropolis showed a considerable falUing off. The latter was no doubt caused by the prevailing belief that ler Majesty would leave Camp early, and no field-day would take place, for to do them bare justice the general public always manifest the most intense anxiety to witness as much of the evolutions as the smoke and dust of Aldershott permit. The troops paraded at 8 o'clock, and immediately proceeded to their allotted positions. No visible " enemy" was present on this occasion, but he must have been in great force somewhere, as an awful amount of powder was expended and some eight or 10 miles of heath were charged, occupied, enfiladed, outflanked, and bombarded ere he was effectually dislodged and the troops relieved from their inexplicable contest with their invisible foe. One division of the force, under the Hon. Major-General Spencer, comprising a troop of Horse Artillery, two field batteries, the 1st Dragoon Guards, 4th Light Dragoons, 7th and 15th Hussars, 3d battalion of Rifles, and the 15th, 20th, 96th. and 97th Regiments, remained on the south side of the Basingstoke Canal. They were posted in an uncommonly aqueous hollow called Rushout Bottom. The right vwng was under Lord William Paulet, and included a troop cf Horse Artillery, a field battery, the 6th Enniskillen Dragoons, 1st battalion of Coldstreams, 1st battalion of Rifles, three companies of the Engineers, with a pontoon train, and the 54th, 66th, and 22d Regiments. These were on the northern side of the canal, near Eelmore farm, and facing the wood, which they watched with a jealous vigilance, for somewhere under the cowslips and harebells of that cool retreat the enemy was supposed tobe stowed away. TheRoyal party came upon the ground at 10 o'clock, attended by a staff more briliant and almost as numerous as a squadron of cavalry. All the Royal family were on horseback, Her Majesty wearing her military riding-dress, with General's sash, open hat, and plume of red and white feathers. The Prince Consort wore the full uniform of a field-marshal, and Prince Alfred the Highland dress. In attendance on or following the Court were the Duke of Cambridge, the Dake of Leinster, the Earl of Cardigan, Sir Richard Airey, General Wetherall, Lieutenant-General Lord Rokeby, Lord Methuen, Major-Generals Knollys, Scarlett, and the Hon. C. Grey; Colonels Tyr whitt, Kennedy, and Wood; Major Smith, Captain the Hon. Dudley de Ros, Lieutenant Cowell, &c. The French Princes were also present. Directly the Royal party had.takentheir stationona smalleminence which overlooked the dusty expanse beneath the movements commenced by an advance of the right wing against the wood, while General Spencer seconded the attack by pushing forward his batteries to Tyscote-ridge and opening a thundering cannonade, which must have struck terror into the enemy's ranks. Aided by this, Lord Paulet's force made a most leisurely advance, preceded by their skirmishers, who drove their antagonists from several small shrubs, and turned a clump of furze with much gaUantry and success. Nothing more formidable than dry ditches and volumes of dust occurred to check the ardour of the advance, and the right wing, protected by a desultory cannonade, at last reached and occupied the wood itself. Through this the riflemen penetrated, and the effect was exceedingly pretty as they broke througb the leaty covert, dodging from bush to bush, and making the quiet glades ring again with the sharp echo of their rifles. The "e nemy" was of course driven out, as were also a great number of sparrows and other little birds, who seemed to think the object of the mnanceuvre was specially directed against themselves, aLd became mute and fugitive accordingly. The pontoons were again resorted to to effect a junction with the force under General Spencer, on the south of the canal,and again the Engineers displayed the importance of their functions by keeping everybody waiting, while the raft was constructed with all that aptitude which distinguishes a soldier when he has anything to do with the water. The majority of the troops crossed on the permanen and floating bridges, the pontoon raft only sufficing to bring over its constructors with some of the Rifles. Arrived on the othor side, a junction was effected with the force under General Spencer, which deployed into line and pushed up the valley south of Tyscote ridge, General Paulet's brigade following in contiguous columns. Skirmishers were again sent out, dotting the plains with their dark uniforms, and the little puffs of white smoke which fiinged their straggling line. The main body, with artillery in advance and cavalry on the flanks, followed rapidly, and in this order a considerable distance was traversed, the infantry marching over the rather uneven ground with a rapidity, compactness, and good order that was beyond praise. Suddently the whole force of the cavalry was hurried up to the front, the five regiments forming one magnificent line nearly half a mile in lengtb, and advancing like a massive wall, with a clatter and jingle that could be heard far and wide. The advance of these fine corps was a beautiful sight while it lasted, or, rather, while they could be seen. This, however, was but a I rief interval, for the fine, sooty-looking deposit which covers all Aldershott rose around their every movement in dense clouds and gradually enveloped the whole mass in impenetrable obscurity. Of them. therefore, nothing more was seen for a considerable time; but as the dust rolled away and away, apparently to the very verge of the heath, we presume the mounted troops accompanied it also. Aftersometime they returned, but aU so utterly begrined as to make it difficult to recognize the regiments tbatbadlatelyprickedforthinallthepomp of war, and to lead to a general opinionithat the "enemy" must have taken refuge in some cbimney, and compelled the gaUant cavalcade-man and horse-to ascend it in pursuit. The Light Cavalry were then manceutvred to protect the guns, for this time the enemy were supposed to be attacking, and the Division of Infantry under General Spencer deployed into line and threw out skirmishers, who, after defending each bush with desperate tenacity for some timne, were at last compelled to give ground, and driven in with ignominy. The infantry opened a tremendous rattling file fire, which was maintained with deafening spirit for some time, but with no other effect than thab of combining the smoke with the dust, and creating a lively apprehension that the troops would be smothered in the open air. The bugles accordingly sounded to cease firing and retire, the lines broke into open columins of companies, and the Rifles, 20th, 96th, 15th, and 97th Regiments retreated rapidly between the regiments of the Reserve Division, under Lord Paulet, which in turn in-tantly deployed, and opened a fusillade. Tho whole of this rather difficult movement was accomplished with a perfect good order and quickness that was most creditable to both officers and men,- and spoke highly for the efficency of camp discipline. Another very difficult evolution, and one which can rarely be ventured on in the presence of an active enemy-that of changing the front of the army to meet a sudden attack in flank-was also peiformed with wonderful regularity and speed. The force was then handled as if seeking for an op. portunity to engage at an advantage, which we suppose was at last presented by that most careless of antagonists the Camp foe, for suddenly, amid a dis. tracting clang of trumpets, the cavalry were let loose like an arrow fronm a bo-a, and sped across the valley. Away they went, with gathering force, and with a great wave. like motion surged over the hiUs beyond, leaving only a portentous cloud of dust to mark their track and watn the enemy of the whirlwind of war that had flown past to desolate their ranks. The black dust still hung about in massive eddying folds, when the troopers returned through it with a dim gleam that made their aspect yet more terrible as they came plunging and surging on, the very earthlshakingunder the eareer of athousand horses. This movement was supposed to have placed the enemy almost kiors dc cornbnt, and only render one smart application of cold steel necessary to their entire extinction. So the 22d and CGth deployed into line like a great machine unfolding; down came the long row of bayonets with alouddeadly clatter, and with a hearty English cheer the regiments charged up hill. Well, indeed, was it that the enemy was a military fiction, as those troops reached the hill top, panting and dusty, but still vigorous, and still pressing forward with a merciless pertinacity that would have almost carried them through a stone wall. This feat concluded the evolutions of the day, and after marching pasb the troops returned to their cantonments. While defiling past Her Majesty one could not but be struck with the swarthy sunburnt aspect of the men. They have become so tanned within the last week or so that their complexions would deceive the eye of faith itself, and Brahmins nmight fraternize with them without once suspecting their Anglo-Saxon blood. Every corps, however, is in splendid health and perfect training. Her hlajesty and Royal family, after partaking of lunch at the Pavilion, proceeded to Farnborongh station, where the Rtoyal train was in waiting to convey them to Osborne. The Hon. R. Dutton, M.P., one of the directors, and Mr. Crombie, the secretary of the company, were in attendance, and proceeded with the train, which, as usual, was intrusted to the care of Mr. Scott and Mr. Beattie.

'ELECTION~ C03'IMITT.EE,S. VtAT.MV) ane cae ror tile sItting member was commenced at the sitting of the committee on Saturday. Mr. C. Baxter, a confectioner at Maldon, said that Mr Western canvassed at Tollesbury two or three weeks before the election. Tho witness then stated that he had once gos;e into the Queen's Head at Tollesbury with two voters, and they had some refreshment together, for which he paid at the time, but was afterwards repaid by the voters. On cross-examination by Mr. SLADP, he said that Mr. Western continued the canvass while he was in the publichouse. He also canvassed for Mr. Western at Tollesbary. A few years ago he failed and paid 6s. 8d. in the pound, bet some of his creditors had now been paid in full. He went to Tolesbary with a cart and horse hized of Mr. Lansdell. After he received the Speaher's warrant he said to Mr. Digby that ho supposed he should be wanted for the Tollesbury cases. He had been told that he was accused of having treated two votere, and he then remembered having getoTollesbury. Last night Mr. George Digby, the tlection auditor, told him that he would have to come to Iondon in the morning. He said he was ready to answer a~nv questionis that might be put to him. Mr. Digby told lim that Miss Payne had said he had treated two voters, bundhe denied the charge. He had not paid for the hire f the horse and cart to Tollesbury, but he thought he was liable for it. On re-examination he said that no one ordered him to go to Tollesbury. He went to canvass some voters whom he knew. There had been no concealment with regard to the brandy and water drunk at Tollesbury. He had been cbaffed about it by his friends. Jamues Bowles, a master oyster dredgerman at Tollesbury, and one of the voters who had partaken of the brandy and water at the QuLeen's Headr with the last witnes3, said Baxter had paid at first because he had no chang ; but before he left the house he obtained change, and repaid Baxter his own share and that of the other voter. On cross-examination by Mr. SrADc,, he said he was a freeman and plumped for Mr. Western. Nearly all the Tollesbury freemen voted for him. He eame up from Maldon this morning. Before he started young Mr. E>igby took down his evidence in writing. Mr. George Wyatt Digby, the election agent of Mr. Western, said he had been a solicitor at Maldon for the last 28 years, and was town-clerk of the borough. Shortly after the death of Mr. Lennard, the former representative of the borough, in May or June, 1856, Mr. Western issued an address. A requisition signed by 300 electors was presented to him. He canvassed at intervals, from August untR the dissolution. The borough was about 60 miles in circumference. He had been instructed by Mr. Western to be very cautious not to allow any treating or other illegr.l practices to be cairied on, and he had strictly obeyed these instractions. Mr. Western had no committee. Witness conducted the business of the election at some rooms. IHis son canvassed with Mfr. Western, The money for the election expenses passed through his hands, and the auditor's accounts contained a faithful enumeration of those expenses. His son was the election auditor. Since the passing of the Corrupt Practices Act all the mayors of the borough had appointed his son to that office. The mayor last year was Mr. George May. Witness never employed Riley in any way during the election, and did not r member having spoken to him more than once. He gave no orders for drink to be given away at the Wellington, and was not aware that any was given away. It had been castomary for employers to give breakfasts to their servanta on election mornings, and he had cautioned some persons against the practice. The other side engaged prizefighters at the election, and he engagedadozen "1conductors" to protcct voters to the poll-one conductor to each prizefighter. Ho told Lansdell to strike out all names but l in the bill. He never tampered with any of the election accounts. Not afigure was altered after the bills were paid. Since the election Lansdell had given up the King's Head ard taken the Blue Boar, a Conservative house. lHis fee for the election was 100 guineas, and, including that sum, the whole expenses amounted to 4221. At the last registration he had a clear gain of 70 votes. The number of votes (427) polled by Mr.Westerncorresponded within two or threowith a return he had made only a few days before the election. He had not paid 15s. for the expenses of a voter from Ipswvch. He had cautioned Mr. May and others not to pay travelling expenses until the case of "Cooper v. Slade" had been decided by the House of Lords. On cross-examination by MIr. SLs.DE, he said he believed the Wellington biU was 41. or 51., that Baxter was a volu a- teer, not employed by him, and that his son had taken an active part in politics since 1854. At the conclusion of Mr. Digby's examination the Comi mittEe adjourned until this day. WEYMOUTH. This Committee was occupied the whole of Saturday with hearing further evidence in the case of Thomas Vile, the cobbler, who had supplied Mr. Campbell with some slippers previous to the election. Vile, who had been examined on , iday, was cross-examined by Mr. E. James. He admitted that he was in the habit of taking "a little beer" occasionally, and said that some persons on the other side had got hold of him and treated him to porter, cheese, and pickled onions, and induced him to talk a great deal of nonsense about what had occured between himself and Mr. CampbelL His bill for the boots and slippers supphed to Mr. Cam bell was, he said, 41., of which he received 31. Mr. Campbell's butler had at first given him a check for 101., but he got drunk and forgot to get it cashed, and the batler took it back. The wife and niece of Vile were also examined. A shoemaker named Cox proved that Vile had purchased a pair of boots and three pairs of slippers at his shop, that he bad brought back tho boots, and a few days afterwards paid for the slippers. He also stated that he had had a conversation with Mrs. Vile about the 101. check, and that he had told some one that he had found out that Vile had been bribed. Joseph Fanwell said he had asked Vile to vote for Mr. Butt, and that-Vileaid,-"If yoa will make up a 51.-note I will give Butt a plumper." Mr. Fanwell and another witness were called to prove that they had heard Vile speak about the check for 101. Eviderce was then given that Vile had been frequently seen about the house occupied by Mr. Campbell at Weymouth during the election, and that a 101. check had been cashed in the course of the election by a person who received it from Rus ell, the butler of Mr. Camnpbell. The Committee then adjourned. In our report of the proceedings of this committee which was published on Friday last Mr. A. R. Curtis is represented to have said,-`'ln the election week a large qanutity of beer was sent to Bonella's house by Mr. Devenish." The statement of Mr. Curtis was,-"In the election week a large quantity of beer was not sent to Bonella's house by Mr. Devenish." FALKIRK B3URGHS. The committee met on Saturday at noon, Sir J. Paking. ton in the chair. The first important witness was Mr. Ritchie, an ironmonger in Lanazk, and a member of the local committee for procuring the return of Mr. Merry. He received 11.16s. for going to Falkirk on business connected with the election and for expeases incurred during the canva6s. The cominittce met at the Commercial Inn, and its meetings were attended by Mr. Lockhart, the recognized ageut of Mr. hlerry, and by Mr. Brown, the person alleged to have bribed Patrick Wigley. Refreshments were p:ovided to the committee free of expense; indeed, the members called for what they pleased, and paid for nothing. They dined together after the poll, and upon the same occasion several electors who had been brought in from Carstairs to vote for Mr. Merry wereentertained in a similar manner. He did not know who paid the bill. During the electioa a baud of musie perambulated the streets, and witness heard Mr. Brown ordering them to be supplied with drink. Loakhart and Brown canvassed together. Witness once sawM r. Merry in the committee-room, but he could not say whether before or after the election. In cross-examination witness stated that the Lanark cormmittee was formed before the appearance of Mr. Merry as a candidate, for the purpose of supporting any gentlemAn of Liberal opinions who might present himself in opposition to Mr. Baird. He declared that nothing he received while serving on the committee had the slightest influence upon his vote. Mr. Lockhart warned the committee against engaging in illegal practices, and a copy of the Act was pIacerded in the committee-room and in various parts of the on Mr. Gardiner, an old gentleman retired from business, said that be also was a member of the Lanarlc committee. He was present at the dinner which took place in the Commercial Inn after the close of the poll. His evidence was neither important nor interesting; but uponocross-examination he declared his belief that the last election was conductcd with unusual order and decorum. Mr. Thomas Wise, a farmer residing near Falkirk, stated that a few days before the election he was waited upon by Mr. Merry, who solicited him for his vote. Mr. Merry was accompanied by Mr. Adams, his local agent, and by a gentleman named Mitchell. Witness told the party that he had always voted for Mr. Baird. Some time before he had appled to the National Bank for a cash credit, and had been told by the Falkirk agent of the bank-the same Mr. Adams who acted for Mr. Alerry-to wait a little. One or two days after the interview referred to above witness happened to be in Hamilton, where he saw Mr. Merry, with whom he converst d on the subject of the election. Witness said to him, " t hope you will befriend me," to which Mr. Merry replied, " No, not just now, as theoAct is very strict; but speIk to ny agent in Falkirk." Upon his return home witness received a communication from his wife. He voted for Mr. Baird. Mrs. Wise, wife of tho last witness, stated that during the absence of her husband, a day or two before the election, a gentleman who vwas introduced to her by a servant as Mr. Adams, of Falkirk, called at her house and told her that Mr. Wise had pledged himself to vote for Mr. Merry. Re added that Mr. Dawson, from whom Mr. Wise held his farm, was also a supporter of Mr. Merry. She made a romark to the effect that if her husband failed to pay his rent -about 1501. was then due-his affairs would soon bo oxposed, upon which Mr. Adams said, "Tell Mr. Wise that I have unlimited authority from Mr. Merry, who is a man of enormous wealth, to give him whatever he wants." Sho was awvare that her husband had applied to the National Bank for a cash credit, and that Mfr. Adams had told hirm to wait for a few days. She told Mr. WVise upon his return what Mfr. Adams had said. George Galbraith, a labourer residing in Laurieston, near Falkirk, stated that a person named Scoular, in the employment of Mr. Merry, asked him to vote for that gentleman. He refused to do so, having already promised to vote for Mr. Baird. Scoular repeated his request, saying that if he lost his employment in consequence of his Yote, (witness was then in the service of Mr. Forbes, of Callander, a friend ef Mr. Baird,) Mr. Merry would be glad to give him work. Witness roplied that he felt bound to adhere to his promise - whereupon Scoular urged him not to vote at al, arnd offered to pay the expenses of a jaunt to Arshire. Bnt he was proof against the temptation, and vohd for Mlr. Baird. The C:ommnittee then adjourned.

k,TATE OF TRADE. MIANCRESTER, JULY 18. There is very little change in the market since yasterday. The trade in cloth with India is on a very smaU scale, aud the chief purchases this morning were on account of tha homnel trade, which remains steady for the time of the year; but there is seldom anything at this period of the year to give an impetas to it. The general presperity of the country andthefinenessof theoveather haveledtoafairdemandun to this period for printed muslins and light fancy goods, anQ prices are well maintained. Cloths, as wellasyarms, are also in request for China, at foll rates. The general or aggregate business in cloth, however, is very limited, and continaued proof of this is given in the fact that sollers can make no advance in prices approximating to the increasing cost of production. Stocks are low, but prices caanot be made to keep pace with those of cotton. In yarns, for which the export demand is on a fair scale, including a rather brisk trade for the continent, prices are Id. per lb. dearer than last week. BTR 5RIIHAII, JULY 18. Since the tormination of the quarterly mecatings the iron trade has remained steady, and parties who were reluctant to purchase at declared prices have been compelled to enter into contracts for supplies at current rates. The American demand continues to increase, and there is every appearance of a more than usaally brisk autumn trade, as well with the British North American oolonies as with th3 United States. The copper-market, which it was hoped was more settled, is again distarbed by another expected reduction of price. 1Theso fluctuations operate injuriously upon manufactarers and factors. The former decline purchases of the raw mate. rial beyond immediate necessity, and the country trade decline to give orders in prospect of a further fall ia the prices of manufactured articles. It is admitted, however, on aU hands that more business is doing in brass foundry goods than during the spring months, and that prospects are hopeful rather than discouraging. The patent ships sheathing and seamless tubing manufactures are extremely active. The makers of tin wares continue to be moderately well engaged, but, as with other branches of local production, chiefly upoa foreign orders. The military gun trade is quiet, if not absolately flat, but the birding branch, as might be expec'ed at this season of the year, is extraordi. narilyactive. There are large orders in hand for edged toolsreqairedfor the South American and West Indian marlkets. For general ironmongery factors' travellers report the demand to be improving. In the agricultaral counties more particularly business is more active, and all deseriptions of implements find a ready sale. All branches of the glass trade in Birmingham, plate and flint, are indifferently off for orders. In consequence of the depressed state of the manufacture one of the largest establishments of the: neiglibourhood has recently effected two reductions in the wages of a portion of their men. This has led to " a strike," and many of the operatives formerly employed in the Spon-lane Works have, it is said, betak-eza themselves for euiployment to the United States. The great foundries of the district are fairly employed, and some of then extremely basy. The wroughtnailersara full of orders, most of which are for shipment, and at Cradley and the neighbourhood there is more than ordinary bustle among the chainnnakers. NOTTINGHAM, JuLI 18. There is a sli ht improvement in the lace trade, there having been some small orders for the continent. There is a fair icquiry for cotton quiltings. For first-class goods a fair price is given, wvhile for some articles the p3rice offered is 5553thing but remunerative. In meest branches of the trade there is not much doing; July, however, is usually a flat month. Silk continues exceedingly higb, and as yet there is no prospect of n reduceion in price. Yarns are also high. In hosiery there is a lithe more doing; trado, however still continues q siSt in most branches, and manufacturer are wisely nbstaining from accumulating6 stocks. Hosiery, silks, and yarns are wilhout alteration. LEICESTER, JULY 18. '1'here is an improvement in the hosiery trade, maunufac. tu.ers for the most part giving out umore work. In the fancy department there is a decided change for the better, still the high price of 2aaterial will prevent manufacturers making esxtra stock. There is not much change in trade at Lr,ughborough or Hinekley. Wools are realizing very high prices. At Brackley fair the price averaged was 42s. per tod, being Gs. higher than last year, and all the wool was disposed of with the exception of two small lots. Worsted yarns are advancing, but as manufac',urers have stil some stocks on hand, sales wiUl not be effected at the advance until those stocks are cleared. LEEDS, JULY 18. The woollen trade has been rather quiet this week, both in the warehouses and the public markets. There appears to be a lull in both the home and the export trade, and pusehases are made chiefly to make up stocks, or where anytbing good and cheap for the faU trade is offered. The manufacturers continue to be moderately well employed, and the stocks in hand are only of an average character for the season, so that, with the present prospect of an early arid abundaut harvest, a good trade for the close of the year is aDticipated. To-day's market has presented no feature of material change. The attendance of buyers was of an average character, and they bought in the aggregate a good bulk of the heavier kinds of cloth for the viater trade, being stimulated thereto in some degree by the prospect of an increase in price, both wool and indigo having advanced at the current sales in the metropolis. The home growers of wool seem disposed to have the very highest current prices, and are holding off selling rather than take less. hlence trensactions in Yorkshire vools have not been very numerous or to a large amount this week. Foreign and colonial kinds, it is hardly necessary to say, are held very firmly by the dealers. HALIFAX, July 1S. The worsted and carpet trades are enjoying a fair amount of prosperity, bua neither of them is actually brisk. The demand is more steady and regular than in, soine past years, so that there is less flnctuation and less ground for specalative hope or fear. The gre,at bulk of the manufacturing operatives, are in wesk, but not wholly on full time. Today's mark et has been fuUy as active as that of last Saturday, an-agood deal of yarns and pieces has been sold. ilatbeab less done in wool, and prices without alteration. DUBLIN, JUrLY 1S. The Customs' receipts for the week to Thursday, July 1(:, incinsive were lS,7261. against 19,7261. last week BELFAST, JULY 18. iinen.-We cannot notice any material alteration in any bvanch of the linen trade this week, either in supply or demand.

ThILORATION FROTH IVERPOOL.-LPOOL, July 18.-The increase in the number of emigrants who are now leaving Great Britain, as compared with last year, is astounding. If the outpouring of the sons of labour from this port continues with the same force to the end of the year, there will have sailed from Liverpooi alone nearly 17,000 more persons than took their departure in the year 1856 from all the ports in the united kingdom put together. For instance, the total emigration from Great Britain and Ireland last year was 176,554, of which number 127,558 souls left Liverpool alone, while onlv 19,191 sailed from London, 8,898 from Plymouth, 7, 3 from Southampton, and so on. In the six months ending June 30th last 96,770 persons left Liverpool for all foreign and colonial ports, being an inorease of 36,084 as compared with the first half-year of 1856. The number in the March quarter was 28,234, and in the quarter ending June 30. 68,436. The latter have been thus distributed-:-48,263 have sailed in 135 ships for the United States of America; 10,505 in 29 ships for Victoria; 6,778 in 25 ships for Canada; 2,032 in five ships forNow South Wales- 604 in two sbips for Tasmania; 160 in four ships for New Bruswick; 33 In ix ships for South America; 18 in three 3hips for the M3aurtius; 15 In two ships for British Guiana; 15 in two shipe for Prince Edward's Island; and 13 In one ship for Adelaide. The greatest exodus took place In the month of April, when the increase, s compared with the corresponding month of 1856, was no less th 10,694. The vast mncrease in the emigration from Liverpool will be seen from the following figures, which represent the increase in each month as compared with the same periods last year :-In January the increase was 2,461; February, 4,380; March, 5,927April, 10,694; May, 5,451- and June, 7,163. The tot;i iecrease has been d1stribute, in tolerably equal roportiors between the emigration to the United States, C9anada, and the Australian Colonies, but, perhaps, the augmentation of the numbers proceeding to the Australian colonies is greater in proportion than the increase in the emigration either to the United StAtes or to Canada. We find that while in Mav, 1856, the t9tal emigration from Liverpool to the Australian colonies Wa 753, in the corresponding month of the present year the 4mlpration from Liverpool to Victoria alone was 3,048, besidea 1,150 to New South Wales and 279 to Tasmania. The followizg classiiation for the quter endlng March last shows of what countrymen the steerage pas. songers consisted:-English, 14,064; Scotch, 3,976- Irish (proceeding chiefly to the States), 34,533; and natives of other countries, principally Germans, 3,250. DurIng the current month the following vessels have saued rom Liverpool for Melbourne:-On the 7th, the Donald Kay, with 61i9 stven nerage and 22 abin passengers; ons the gers; on the s^ame day, the Oliver Lang, with 165 steerag and i3cabln passengers; on the 16th, the Florence Nightangale, with 1S7 steerage and 8 cabin passenvers* and on the 17th the Albion, with 303 steerage and 4 cabin passengers.

LONDOS, MONDA Y, JULY 20, 1857. The most encouraging feature in the affairs of India, as discussed by our numerous correspondents, lies at this moment in the one great fact announced by the last mail. Deplorable as is the state of the Bengal Presidency, amd.l urgently as the crisis demands all i]Ce iei'.;ce anid vigour which a Government caw exe rl. ti'w'i is at least this prominent and all i:;por? .' bi; to be discernedthat whereas mu' .- ..ly exploded in the Bengal Army, wl ..-ify o- Delhi had beenfor a whole month im tn of armed insurgents, the positi.:! -iit was better by all accounts tlbm. :1E :' .-t the beginninig of the outbreak. A military insurrection may be considered, perhaps, without much temerity of conjecture, to have done its worst when the period of our greatest weakness has been apparently surmounted. If the Government troops, at the moment when the mail was despatched, were not known to have captured Delhi, it had been at any rate ascertained that they were masters of the field, and that the superiority, even before the arrival of reinforcements, undoubtedly rested with ourselves at the very focus of the revolt. The trial of strength had occurred, though not precisely in the manner anticipated. The mutinous Sepoys had themselves transferred the Leene of combat from the streets of Delhi to a spot outside the walls, and there, in their own position, they were attacked and defeated, although it is probable, both from the nature of their proceedings and the reports from other quarters, that they had received large accessions of Estrength. Ilere, then, are the great facts of the ease :-Of the three chief divisions of the Presidency, one-the Punjab-has been maintained not only in tranquillity but in a position to give aid to the authorities outside its frontiers; in the xecond-that of Bengal Proper-the suprema7 of Government has been preserved; while in the third-that of the North-Western Provinces.-the sword of retribution is suspended over the very heads of the mvolters. Add to this, that the force by which it wias accomplished is being strengthened every day, and we may be induced both to refeebt with pride upons the efforts of our countrymem and to look with confidence to the ultimate rew,lts. If, however, there are these strong grounds for reassurance, there are also conmiderations eaIling for every exertion we can make. With wbatever success the crisis may have been met it will be a crisis still, and one which may well tax the Alities of an Administration and the resources of a State. Let us proceed still to consider the' irighter side first. The Native troops of the Bengal .Presidency have deserted by thousands, and ths eontagion of mutiny has irremediably infected a large portion of that army. This is a most serio-m fawt, but the circunitances carry witil them. mmh to modify our conclusions. The very proceedings of the Sepoyz show that they are without eaders, without heart, without organization, and generally without an object. A certain proportion of the deserters have betaken themselves to Delhi, and it can hardly be otherwise than fortunate that'these who have the courage to cross swords with their rulers should repair to the one spot where we were pre,pred to receive them, and so save us the workof seeking or encountering them elsewhere. Bu; the great majority of the mutineers appemr simply to have taken fligbt, and to have left; their colors without any mere positive deaegnJ than that of simple desextien. Passing from) the native Army to the native population we' find still mere unimpeachable grounds for satisfa-3 tion. Notwithstanding an example or two to the contrary-such as in a case like this wouldi i naturally ocer-it is evideit ftat the natives aFt large are indisposed to any eympathy with the mutineers, and not disaffected, 'owards our rule.. In the Panjab, as the striking latter of our corre- - spondent showed; our authority, promptly and vigorously asserted, fairly earriad the day; and aven in the North-Western Provinces the villagers ippear usually to have made- common cause with 'overument. Owu position, in' ahort, is that of -ulersawho have the country and' the great land- i wners with them, but whose Auuy is to a great I* 3xtenti in a state of revolt. Thi- position may be 3oth lamentable and dangerousw, but desperate it J *annot be.. On the otherside, however, VAerc are numerous mnd urgenb reasons for exerting without remission 11 the power- of the. Empire in ,he restoration of 3rder. Assuming, as we trust- we may, that the )perations agaiest Delhi have been prosecuted with the unsparing vigour which such an occaion domanded, that the city is- nov in our hands, and that a terrible retribution, has been inflicted Dn the insurgents, it must be remembered that the adjacenb provinces, as well as some parts of Bengal, are in a state resembling more or less that Df actual anarchy. Thousands. of Sepoys, though cot inl overt rebellion, are d6spersed over the country with arms in their hands. Swarms of marauders-are traversing the territoriesof indostan, with the powerof inflicting seriousraischief on nativeoommunitk% or isolated stations of Europeans. Over a considerable portion of Pritish India the. ardinary functions of ad1ministation must be. impaired. cc suspended, and such a condition of. things ought to be terminatedl without an hour'savoidable delay. The very eircuwstances now teUing, in our-i avour are conditional upon our own deter.- mined exertions. The Sepoys in general are afraidc to meet us, the population is willing to supporh us, and the Bombay and Madras Presidencies& are as yet free from disorder; but to maintain. these advantages we maust put forth our wholestrength, and show that we are indeed thepeople we are believed to be, and are really possessed of that power to which obedience isrendered. Even after the present revolt has been crushed a large European force will be imperativelyneeded in the country, both to supply the place of the disbanded Sepoys and to maintain the security of our dominions against any ftesh outbreak of a smouldering flame. Lastly, the very character of the crisis calls for the most energetic and resolate action. It is the very crisis which, -whether really =aticipated or not, was always indicated as involvingg possibly the existence of our Empire, and it has now occurred with a momentary success on the part of the revolters, and yet left the Empire in our hands. The Sepoys have mutinied; they have set up a standard of insurrection, they haave seized the capital of the old Mogul State, and have proclaimed the representative of the old Mogul Sovereigns. A revolt exploding with more murderous violence, extending overa greater portion of the Army, or attended at first with more favourable cirumstances for the rebels> could not well hava been expected, and yet the result has produced their discomfiture and defeat already, and appears far more likely to re-wstablish British power on a new basis than to afford any hope to the insurrection or its prometers. iBut to secure all the chances in our favour we must act with l the energy we can command. The occasion, i; turned to proper account, may not only be divested of harm to our rule, but may be made to confirm our authority, and place it beyond risk of such perils for the future. The great shock has been given and has been withstood-withstood even under difficult conditions. At Delhi itself on two successive occasions the rebels were fairly worsted, and by this time -we trust they have lost the only position they had ventured to occupy. That such a state of things in the second month of a great military revolt contains much to reassure us it is impossible to deny, but it is equally clear that a crisis of such magnitude and peril will call for our utmost energies before it cau be deprived of its dangers, or so improved as to 'lead to the solid establishment of that authority against which the outbreak was directed.

One of the latest impressions on the confused Parliamentary sensorium was produced by an answer to some em^r3 made eight hours earlier onw the im- portant question whether the Bath Election Committee had been justified in adjourning at 2 o'clock on Thursday. In still broader daylight Lord J. Russxz submitted to the adjournment of a debate which he had forced on in a fragmentary shape about dinner-time. At midnight Lord PA.- mERSTON excused himself for his omission to answer a question as to the defences of the country, on the ground that such a multiplicity of subjects had been dancing before his eyes that the inquiry had escaped his recollection. About the same time the CczAtcELon of the EXCHEQUER satisfied a reasonaable curiosity which had been expressed early in the evening with respect to the Excise duties levied on a substance called pulp! parchment. The Ministes accuracy was tbe more laudable as the question had been combined with a statement on the subject of the Abjuration Oath. The principal subjects of debate were taken up as circumstances allowed in the intervals of miscellaneous discus3ion. The Jewish Disabilities were repeatedly brought under the notice of the House, and the more pressing questions relating to Persia, to China, and to India occupied a considerable share of attention. The PmE: MsmTEsR took an opportunity of repeating his olbections to the project of the Suez Canal; several votes of importance wene taken in Committee of Supply; and several Bills were read a second time or considered for the purpose of agreeing to amendments, Mr. GLAiDSTOTN, who seems disposed to, compensate himself for bi unusual taciturnity of thl last two months, resumed with unabated interest the half-forgotten controversy whether the AS;to'w had the Union-Jack at her masthead. Lord PALmnlsoN, who always seems gayer and more pugnaciw'A on the approach of dawn, not only asserted the eNistenee of the flag, but awMed the interesting fac4thaff4 the lorcha had also the " Blue Peter" flying; and;, as a further proof of his readiness to meet all comnen, the Pn1zsEms declure4 that the opinions off Mr. GLADSTONE and of Lord, JTnN RussELL wevas to himself a matter of perfect indifference. "4 "though my right hon. frienl bad had enougb "of the Chinese question. without perpetually "thrusting it into our debatem"' Mr. DisEAu's effort to' support his recent. ally was instantly answered4 in the same tone of jovial defiance. It is satisfaetbry to find that the flbuse, of Commons is not ElielY by any amount' of tediousness or confusion* tb' wear out the spiritst of its leader. When the thoughts of the country are concentrated on India it is not unnaturalithat the same anxiety should find frequent expeession in Parliament; but the-eonversations which 4,ook;place on the subject were oddly dotted about amid the heterogeneous debat.of the evening. SirRNazxE PÂ£BRY thinks that the'engal Army has n2stinied because there is not ar sofficient number ofw EEglish lawyers in the differentPresidencies, and proposes, with characteristic 'oet, to take the presentropportunity for retracting! tie deliberate legislation of 1853, and abolishing4 the actual Governmen of India. After dealing wi the Bath Election" ('ommittee, and with the new,' method of distribuking Parliamentary papers, the House found itself' engaged in a discussion whether the ships of the lne in the Channel were calculated for the confyance of troops to India. Sir CHAnTss Woor.of course, took the opportunity to say a good- word for his well-known fsWourite the Transitn;: but before the First lBord of the Admira&y could rise the questfiob of steamships had been diversified by a reoonstrance againstt the resolition to abstain from calling out thb- Militia. At this point Lord .EoHN RussEn intervened with his debate on Pacliamentary Oaths. She Suez Canal was for the time disposed of, and then Mr. DIsBaAm discussecliat considerable lengtk0the question whether there- should be a formal Indian debate. Soon afterwards the House agreed to the motion, which hadaall this time been umder consideration, that on, its rising it would adjourn till Monday. The next quesaion-that the SPEr Eshould leave the chair-revived the topic of the Militia, and gave a further opportunity for censidering the expediency of an Indian debate. Sdveral mem'ders made long speeches on the subjeo-of Indian Railways; and at'tlast, in Committee of 0npply, the probable effect ofIhdian affairs on Eng'~zh finance became a legitimte subject of discusson. Mr. GLADSroNi will find few to sympathize in his in- ignation at the- intention of the Ga(mrnment to accelerate the paysment of the balance.due to the Indian Government; but it is certahtW surprising that the effect okftie Indian Mutiny should be to diminish the estimate for the China expedition. The M1inisters cannor ceriously expect that the whole cost of suppressing the revolt shall -ultimately fall on the Indian Dbeasury. The transport of troops from Singapore. 'o Calcutta oughtj, under present eircumstances, o, be considered a, oharge on the Imperial finaness. It is greatly to be regretted th2t-rmeasures were not taken in the last Parliamenlt to correct the abuse of mismellaneous debates. on the formal motion which, i3 necessarily made. on every Friday evening. The experience and g3eat authority of Mfr. SHAW hFEVRE would hav- qnabled him both i to suggest. 'he best method cf dealing with the. evil, and4 to enforce upon unwiling members any; decision which might have beoen formed by the. IIouse. The new SPBAXER is. naturally unable tox interfere with the weight Tsunk attached to the> opinion eS his predecessor; and,when he endeavoured to inte=mpt Lord JoHw RussB"Z in his attempt to anticipate his own subsequeai motion, the ruleg, of the House wVere skilfully evaded by the conventim1al motiom for immediate adjeunment. There.is. no sufficient reason for aflnwing an exceio.onal license of debate eithter on the questor. of adjournment or on the- motion for going inte. Committee of Supply. XEpress permission can always be obtained for the jntroduction of qu.stions of pressing importance. Lord PAnsrSTeN7 at once ixed -a day for the' iormal debate on Indin affairs, and, if Lord JoE lRussmr. failed to obteain similar facilities for his 1ilI on Parliamentary Oaths, he is fully capable of appreciating the mofives of the Ministerial leader. The conversational remarks of Friday night were the less excuasbae because the questions of India and Chi= fell legitimately within the province of debate. Two or three hourn exclusivelydevoted to the prciRer business of tbq evening would have been pe4feetly sufficient f' the explanation of the votcs, and for the discusm4on of th-objections which w4re raised by the qonenis of the Governments The House of Cormmons entertains a well-founded abhorrence of those members who are always ready to give their opinions on any subject which may arise; and it ought to be remembered that no class of speakers prfits so habitually by the habit of miscellaneoug discussion. The House of Lords, with its empty benches and gentlemanlike air of languor, may possibly afford to dispense with strict adherence to rules; but the House of Commons, when released from formal discipline, degenerates into a garrulous clab. As all colours mixed together make white, so a multiMarious confusion of topics is equivalent to a suspension of business. Except for the passing of a few votes, the House might as well for practical purposes have been counted out on Friday at halfpast 6 in the evening as have Eat wearily on for 10 hours longer.
The prolonged debate of Friday night is a proof of how little is to be expected from Lord JOHN RUSSELnS new scheme of legislation on the Je,ish question. Wlith his usnal infelicity the Whig politician is about to stop up the only path by which the House of Commons can rescue itself from its difficulty. The Lords have rejected Bills for the Emancipation of the Jews in every form; the alteration or abolition of certain oaths which nobody defends has been refused, simply because the change would permit members of the raceto take their seats as legislators. Even a majority of 140 in the Lower House has had no effect on the obstinacy of the Peerage. As far as it is possible to judge, there is no chance that the House of Lords will listen to the voice of the country on this matter. Relying on the knowledge that the Jews are weak,-that there is no deep feeling roused by the denial of their claims, the Lords may be expected to remain for another ten years as intolerant as now. We must confess that the only chance of a settlement, as far as we can see, lies in the independent action of the House of Commons. Shouldthe House decideto omit thewords " on the trae faith of a Christian!' when the member for London conmes to be sworn, and also to treat any prosecution for penalties as a breach of Privilege, the matter may, perhaps, 1e satisfactorily ended. The Jews would have gained the right of being elected, and the Lords would probably be content with feeling that the Jewish magnates of the City were still ezluded from the IUpper House. It is probable that llparties would acquiesce, after a little slirmishiV, in such a compromise. Now, that the Houserof Commons has an inherent right to direct the frm in which its own meembers shall be admitted eems reasonable enough, and a part of the Privilege that in more storry days the Commons always asserted. But it cannot be denied that the Hore, by its conduct in this matter, has gone far to debar itself from exercising any such innate preregative. For ten years ib has treated the words of the oath as unchangeable, except by Act of ParHlmhent, amd has resistecl the one or two faint at*;pts which were made t-o settle the question without the concurrence of the Peers. We are perfbetly prepared to hear this' concession urged as necessarily precluding stparate astion now. Yet- the Houne might hold that no, fornmer negligence couldt be construed into a marrenderof its rights, and that. though, to make assurance doubnib sure and to obey more completely the- spirit of the Constitutioi;succesive Ministries harve desired to proceed by Bills. there is nothing- to prevent the Commonsina case of necessity obtafning their object by mesns of a series of resolutions. Diat if anything coulddmake this line Off conduct indefensible, it would be the sending up to thli Iords a Bill to enals the Lower House to, do the very thing whish it would afterwards-have to assert its power of doing without their aase!rti The Bul, of course, wouidebe summarily dismissed. by the- Lords, and the Commons would have to begins their course of independence with a pesition infiitely worse than before. Certainly no argument against a right'canebe stronger thanothat the tlijig clained has been- lately asked as- a favour ;; yet at this time, when the Oaths Bil.has just beensrejected, after Wing sent up to the liords, by an immense majoryt of a new House o' 6Commons,. when it is plainly.ppoved that the Tony, leaders cae neither for the pinions of the peeop nor' their-representatives, lb:d Jon RussExri. would ask, lbave of the Lords,fort he Commons to be allowed to. alter the oath Xb- themselves. Anything more impolitic and injtrious to the cause it-is difficult, to'imagine. We-tiust, therefore, that the House will hear no mcw. of Lord JoHx RsEsms Bill.. If it be really intended to settle this-tedious quesHi, there is but-one course. It is for. the Commron to say whether"they will allow the House of Iiords to debar ary class of British. subjects of the-ir. rights. A deputation from the Place-yard meeting is to wait on.. Lord PALERSTIN' to-morrow tDo confer with iim on the course- to be pursued in this mattez We trust thai no excessive- regard for fo-eis will prevent the PRnuEan fromacting, with his usual courages and vigour. Lot it be remembered that the Jewish memnbee. must be s^ated by resolution., or not at .i!. - StiU more, the gap in the. representation. of, London can only be filled -zp by the same- m.eans. Thera,is no chance whan'wer that the Lords will give -,.ay; and we pxesume no one. expects that the Liberal party will yield in the struggle. Theraewill always be far the next 20Pyear. a Jeriah member legallyrslected, but incapable of takilg his seat, unless tie House of Cox%mons.procee. to settle the queztion on its own authority. Now5, necessity knows no law; a grievance andt amn anomaly are to be removed, and ca. only be remaved by the separat& action of the Ctnmonse WFhatever may be the lawyers' view of'he quaeSticz, as evinced in the advice of former AttorneyGenerals and in the.- judgment of the Court. of Elehequer, there can4be no doubt thq.words. "-on "-& e true faith of* a Christian" are-not-essoziial ppAts of the Oath, of Abjuration.. They' were paced in the form.by Act of Parliament.,, anit are thereforO legally EPrt of it, until omitted nder hie sanction of cempetent authocity. sNew, if 3n any occasion, it was absolutely, necessary to make a Jew tabse this oath, the- words would aertainly be omniled by order of any pesiding Judge or Magistrale. But, as3the cathisnwmerely taken on admissicn to certain positions, 'o which a Jew has only. in the present goneragio thought of attaining,. the words hava- been continued because there- was no pressing. necessity for the change. A oPe has now arisen in which it is fitting that (fhn oath should be admimistered in a different fo:aw,. and the question, is, if the Privilege of the House- of Commons nnables it to make such changes in the fom; of words established by law as will beat carry ont th& intentions of the framers and. accord wit-,. the spizit- of the Constitution? The words " on. " the nce faith of a Chzistian" are not more essentially part of the oalth than the wcAas " I wear," and yet -hhe House allowed Mr. PEA: to leave out;; the latter words and insez4 others of his -wn. We fuUy believe tbah if in 1848 tb Commons had simply authorized the Clezk to swear Baron RDonseCin.'j in his own way the thing wcld have been taken as a mater of course, and a slobw, like a Quaker, would haxtiaken his seat wit-heut opposi- tion. It now rzwains for the Hous4.to do what it might have dloao with more digniti at first, and to end this wrat%ued dispute by the qercise of its inherent authoity.

SECOND EDITI ISN. TilB TIMES-OFFICE, Monday Namruing. EXPRESS FRONI PARIS. The foUowing is the letter of our Paris corretpondent, dated yesterday (Sunday), 6 p.m.:- After some time apent in taking counsel and deliberating among friends and colleagues, it seems to be settled that three out of the five Democratic depu-ties for Paris refuse to take the oaths to the Inipe wial Government. These three are General Cavaignac, M. Goudchaux, and Ml. Carnot. The last -s said to have hesit3tcd a good deal, the first less so, Jbut the second declared from the begiuning his repugnance to submit to such a condition. No formal iresolution was come to until some few days ago, when a person is said to bave waited on M. Goudchaux to inquire whether he had made up his anind ou the subject. M. Goudehaux, to whom his -visitor was unknown, asked on what grounds or oi ivhose behalf he interrogated him ? The other reIlied, that he came as an elector. M. Goudchaux Laving hinted his suspicionu that his interlocutor 'was in reality an agent of the authorities, the -stranger at once removed that impression by stating ithat he was a member of the bar and the profes- sional adviser of M. Ollivier, the youngest of the Democratic deputies of Paris, and that he came tn his behalf. He was informed that, though he 'had himaself made up his mind, yet it would be necessary to consult with other parties, that a meeting of the persons chiefly interested would be held, art which all the candidates that were in town would attend, and that then the matter would be definilively rettled. In the rneantime M.. Jules Simon, a mau of moderate Republican opiiions, of uniquestioned probity and itndependence, -f a high order of talent, and, consequently, an authority among his party, was consulted. Be was one of the unsuccessful candidates put forth by the 3)emocratic Committee, in contradistinction to the Vection represented by the Siccle, and of which MI. Garnier-Pag3s was one of the leading personages. The only answer he sent consisted of a page or two of his late work, entitled " La Liblert de -Consciericee, a series of lectures delivered in December last, in the hail of the Literary Society of *Gand. These pages, alluding to the liberty enjoyed by all religious creeds in England, are in the followNng terms:- "Nevertheless, tho Catholics are now emancipated. They aro in the enjoyment of all their rights. They found -churches, ho7pitals, sechools, libraries. They sit ia both Houses of Parliament. The Jews, however, who have niways been received in England, and who encounter no hostiity there, cannot enter into political life. .They are marked by no personal indignity; they 3may be tected, bnt they cannot take possession of their seats, for to do so they must previously take an oatb, .which is one of abjuration. The oath contains these -vords 'I swear on the faith of a Christian.' This is the -only obstacle which has for so many years excluded M,. ULonel Rothschild from Parliament. Is not this, gentle. :men, a great spectacle ? Who thall say, after this, that an oath is nothing, and that we may, without a blush, withoat va fear, invoke the name of God for a poerury ? Who shall say that it Is a mere formality at which strong-minded people may laugh; that nothing is ever effected, nothing gained, by scruples; that the oppressed man only allows himself to be a dupe when ho recoils before au oath dictated lby the oppressor; that it is better to swear to-day and to avenge to-morrow that injury together with others; that thoso who elect AL Rothschild elect him knowIlng him to be a Jew, in order that ho may taka the oath, and that they beforehand absolve him from the :uilt of falsehood and of perjury ! Good Heaven! Does it indeed depend on a man or on a people to free the Luuman conscienco from a moral obligation? Is there beneath Heaven any force or law which is above tho law of God ? SbaU we be faithful to our word of honour after having violated an oat/t ? Is God, indeed, held so lightly in our estimation that we can outrage Hlim with impunity in the face of a great notioa, and in the very sanctuary of the law? What is tho law without revelence for God but the brutal expression of force? And what is a people without God but a coalition of interests which has no value only inasmuch os it serves them? When M. Lionel Ilotbschild uises in tho [ouse of Commons, and when, after having heard the oath read, he declares that his conscience prevents him from subscribing to it, he acts as a man and a citizen should act. HEo in truth performs an act of religion. He bnparts great force to the prinDiple of liberty. He carries it with him, as it were, on quitting the threshold of the House of Commons. There is not one of his collea,aes who does not blush on his bench, and who does not feel that justice has been violated, for a citizen has, on account of his religion, been excluded from his rights." Such was the answer of M. Jules Simon. The meaning of it is obvious. Previously to and during the elections I noticed the arguments employed to induce, or compel, the successful candidates to take the oaths to the Constitution with a mental reservation to violate them on the first favourable opportanity. Every sophism was put forward to reassure khe conscience of those who hesitated :-" WVhy not take the oaths to the regime of '52 with the same intention as the Emperor swore to the Constitution -of '48, and keep it as he has done. We take it with the deteimination of keeping it only so Iong as force majeaure prevents us from breaking it, but mO longer." M. Jules Simon was opposed to such temporizing with conscience. fHe lost his election, ibut, if he had been returned, he would have re*signed; or, if he had taken the oatb, he would have kept it religiously. The meeting alluded to was held, and the Demo. *cratic deputies, except General Cavaignac, who has been absent from Paris for some time, attended. 'he question was put forma]ly whether they would take the oath or not. M. Goudehaux answered for lhimself in the negative. Ee 'was asked, if the DeImocratic party in a body required it of him, what rhould he do ? He said in that case he should obey, ibut that lie could not answer for the consequences; 'while M%l . (Ilivier, on the other hand, declared that he could not answer for the consequences if the Democr-atic party ordered him not to take the oath. It was tben intimated that General Cavaignac, M. Goudchaux, and M. Carnot would refuse the oath, and that this refusal should be drawn up mn the same form, and communicated to the electors and to the Chamber. M. Darimon and M. Ollivier persist in their determination to accept the condition rejected By their colleagues, and, as it would be unfair to presume they do so with mental reservation, we mnay, I suppose, take it for granted that they rally io the Imperial reime. Notwithstanding the re"aolution just adopted, it would not be safe to taflirni that it will be maintained by all to the end, as some time wiU elapse before the Legislative C)hamber meets. The conduct of the authorities in pressing on the interment of B6ranger before twenty-four hours had elapsed, is doubtless palliated by the maxim that n- ecessity has no law". one can hardly condemn ihe precautions taken to prevent a repetition of the tumultuous displays and the serious conflicts of which the streets of Paris have been the theatre on oinifar occasions, thOugh one may blame as un. necessary the menacing intimation conveyed in the vrdinaasce of the Prefect of Police on the morning of the ceremony. The presence of a large military force such as that which watehed over the public t tranquillity was quite sufficient tolawe the disorderly. The haste with which the interment took place was, ft is alleged, owing to the fact of the authorities bavinog received information that revolutionary coom minittees would meet on the night previous to the funeral, and organize their plans of " manifesta. l ton." Wiith the army that Paris and its envir-ons have at hand, anything like a successful at- tempt t at insirection m ay appearhopeless; and the projectors of the "manifestation" may have ontempltted nothing beyond a strong mustering of ,(ople with their appropriate ralUying signs and badges. Those who know how such thingstake place in France, who have not forgotten the pistol ,hot of the Boulevard des Capucines In 1848, and how the merest accident may produce the most for. niidable consequences, must be aware that these demonstrations are never meant to be pacific. There is not a man of the thousands who appeared with the immortelles at their button-hole that has forgotten the doctrine of M. Ledru Rollin, candidly avowed before the High Court of Justice at Bourges in 1849, about the " tour de main," and the most efficacious i ixode of affecting a great revolution in the sihortkst space oftime. A committee of the secret societies was, we are assured, to meet on the day following the death of Bcranger; and it was again to sit the same night, igaorant of the resolation previously come to by the Government that the funeral should take place without delay. There is something abhorrent from every feeling of humau nature in converting affection and reverence towards the dead into an occasion for disorder, and in provoking a collision over the remains, not yet cold, of one whose name has been in the heart and on the lips of Frenchmen for the last 40 years and more, regardless of the dying injunction of the deceased himself. The force ready to act in case of emergency was very large. Independent of the four regiments which kept the boulevards from 'he Theatre of the Ambigu to the Chateau d'Eau, under General Blanchard on Friday, two brigades were in readiness at the BastiUe; and, besides the squadrons of the Paris guards in constant movement up and down the line to keep tha passage clear for carriages and foot passengers, strong patrols of Carabiniers, who had come in from Versailles, watched in the direction of Passy (the poet's former residence) and the places contiguous. Detachments also occupied the streets leading to the Rue Vendomre, where Piranger lately resided. In a word, the arrange. n ents were of such a nature as to crush instantly the slightest attempt at disturbance. B6ranger's character as a man and a poet is too well known to require any particular notice on this occasion. Except the temporary assistance which he received during his earlier struggles with adversity, and while his genius was yet unknown, from the beneficent hand of the Prince of Canino, who was himself ardently devoted to letters, and whose epic of Charlemagne, ou BEglise Delimvre has some passages of merit, he wNas indebted to no man for favours. He owned no protector except hiis own energy; and with the modest fruits of his labour5 be remained contented to the last. He accepted rcward or honours from no Government; he was not even a member of the Legion of Honour; and nol many months since he declined, not arrogantly, but with the utmost respect, the munificence offered to him in the most delicate and graceful manner by the Emperor of the French, who solicited the honour of cheering the dclinwng life of the poet. He had been for years in the receipt of an annuity from M. Perrotin, the liberal proprietor of the copyright of bis works. The allowance was modest, but it wai sufficient for his wants, and even for the practice of the benevolence which was his great characteristic. _No man was more universally popular, and none more endeared to the French people. At the moment his remains were approaching the portal of the church of St. Elizabeth, amidst the silence that prevailed, some delicate hand suddenly touched the organ, and played in slow and exquisiLe cadence the well-known air of one of the poet's most pathetic songs- Parlez-nous do lui, graud'm6re, "Parlez-nous do l; I" It was only for a moment, but the notes brought so forcibly to the mind the memory of the hero, and o the poet who sung his deeds, that the efibet was 5ndescmibable. The portrait of B6ranger will be placed in the Museum of VersaMlles, in the ga"ery with those of Afolibire, Corneille, and Lafontaine, and the street in which he died is to be called Rue de Beranger instead of Rue de Vendome. The posthumous works of Beranger consist of from 40 to 50 SoDgs, which were deposited by him -ome years ago in the hands of a notary, in ParisDuring his residence at Passy he prepared notes fOr a bketch of the revolutionary period of France, and he began his memoirs. He did not long continue this work, and it is said that he destroyed with hi own hand all the documents he had collected for tha purpose. A few notes without method, and his coirespondence,which is considerable, remain. The intimate friendship wvhich existed between the poet and the political leader and orater, Manuel, continued unabated to the last moment of the life of the latter. After his death many letters from the poet were found among his papers, weitten with that gaiety and bonhommie which characterized him, and it is amusing to see the playful marner in which he avoids discussion on political topics at a time when politics were so engrossing. He had the good Eense to resist the entreaties of the injudicious friends who wanted to make him a political personage, and his firmness in declining the post of representative to the Natvonal Aesembly, to which more than 200,000 voices had elected him, is entitled to all praise; it proves that good common sense is not incompatible with high poetic genius. Count Nesselrode is expected this evening in Paris-his first visit since 1815. The oflicers of the Russian steam ship of war Wliborg, and those of the Russian frigate Castor, at present at Brest, have received permission from the Russian Addmiral Pehrens to visit Paris. Prince NVoronzowv, only son of the celebrated Prince NVoronzow, late Governor-General of the C,imea, has arrived in Paris with his family. It is said that a Convention is to be signed between the Sovereigns of the Italian States, with the exception of the King of Sardinia, to guarantee etach other against revolutionary attacks. The Emperor hai received at Plombieres the President of the Commission charged with the examination of the plans of the works projected for the mouth of thoAdour and the improvement of the port of Bayonne. The Emperor has accepted the resignation of M. Laity, Prefect of the department of the Basses Pyrenees; his successor will be appointed without delay. The Minister of Marine has decided that in future no rmore cutters shall be built for the French navy. They are to be replaced by advice boats of 30-horse power. The French steam cutter Newton, of 220-horse power, which formed part of the squadron on the Newfoundland Station, under the command of Commodore Sagot-Duvaureux, was lost on the morning of the 10th of June in crossing the channel of the Port-aux-Choix (Newfoundland). The officers and crew were easily saved in consequence of the mildness of the weather and the short distance they were frora land. The corvette S6rieuse, bearing the pennant of the Commodore, which was in the roads of St. George at the time, proceedsd to the wreck, and having given every assistance, received the officers and crew on board. The following private telegraphic despatch ha3 been received :- " MADRID, JULY 17. "The Legislative session of 1857 is closed; that of 1858 will, it is announced, opes ia September. The Queen's confinement is expected in November." PRUSSIA. (rioAs OUR OwVN CORRESPONDENT.) BE,RLIN, JULY 18. This letter, like so many of its most recent predecessors, must open with a reference to the return of the King and Queen to Potsdam from Pillnitz and Dresden. On this occasion, however, I can at len,gth refer to it as 1t7 fait accompli. This is the more satisfactory, as even since I last wrote to you a fusther delay had taken place in their Majesty's departure from Saxony, and many exaggerated 2eports were gaining ground with reference to the Kina's health. The indisposition, from which he suffered in Pillnitz was, in spite of its being in some quarters representedas apoplexy, only a state of exhaustion, the result of considerable fatigue undergone in great heat. The excessive heat is now over; the Royal party has since then only travelled in the cool of the evening, and the King and Queen have settled to take up iheir abode in the Neues Palais, at Potsdam, lEaving Sans Souci to the exclusive accommodation of the Empress-Dowager of Russia. The Empress is expected to arrive here to-day, acconwpanied by the Grana Duke Michael and his fiancie, the Princess Cccilia of Baden, together with her mother, the Dowager GrandDuchess. They are to set off this morning early from Weimar, where they have been on a visit for the last day or two. The Empress will, in the first instance, stop at the Hotel of the Russian Embassy, which, together with the chapel, has been much embellished of late, and subsequently proceed to Sans Souci. Pi;nce Frederick William is expectcd here on Monday from Carlsruhe, where he has been to visit his sister. The Prince of Prussia will not for the present come to Berlin, but will repair from BadenBaden to Ostend, for the benefit of sea-bathing, and not return hither until the grand autumn manceuvres take place, which this year will be in the neighbourhood of k hacapital. The grand field-day' of the entire Corps de Garde and the Third Corps d'Arinie will, in all probability, take place on the !12th of September. The Minister-President, Baron von Manteuffel, who had joined the King at Dresden on Wednesday, for the purpose of reporting progress to him on the road home, returned to town earlier than the King, Eo that a Mlinisterial Council was held yesterday. The object and wish of those parties who lately procured that the King should make an impromptu visit to Vienna were, as I recently pointed out to you, to bring about again an approximation of t"e tbree Courts of Russia, Prussia, and Austria, to save, if possible, some small ruins and remnants of the lately dissolved Holy Alliance. The suggestion of the impulsc to this attempt proceeded, as I understand, from the Court of Austria, but has met with the reverse of a favour. able reception at the hands of the Emperor of Russia. In that quarter there tll rankle deep disappointment and disgust at the disaffection and "' ingratitade@' of Austria during the late war, and the inexpediency of renewing intimate relations with a Power that so lately showed itself untrue to its alliances and its traditions has been very unreservedly pointed out. The motives of the King himself in thus unexpectedly visiting his Imperial nephew at Vienna are, as I lately mentioned, of a purely personal and family character; though the King would gladly see peace and goodwill and kind feeling reigning between Prussia and Austria, the perceptions of the statesmen on both sides, and the instinct of the two nations, recognize clearly the necessity of continued antagonism and opposition. On the other hand, the correspondence is described as be ng very frequent and lively which is going on now between various cronnedheads of Germany and theoEmperor Lous Napoleon, with a -view to his visiting this country, if not this very capital, simultsneously with the Emperor of Russia's next visit. Thi3 coi,cspondence, and the mutual interchange of views which It gives rise to, preparatory to a nearer contact of the Imperial and R3yal personages, are spoken of in aome quarters as consasting of negotiations for an alliance, but this I believe is merely an iaflated slp-slop forin of expression, which might with advantage be superseded by interchange of views with reference to a still closer approximation than has as yet takenplace. On the issue of this correspondence, it Is said, the visit of the Emperor Louis Napoleon to Prussia depends. The Prince of Wales is now established at KUnigswinter, in the Hotel d'Eurors, wbich has been taken for him and his suite till the end of August. His Royal Highness passes under his title of Baron Renfrew ; and tourists on the Rhine, who now pay more attention than ever to Drachenfels, in the neighbourhood of which the Prince is dtaying, have all of them something to relate of htis Royal HigLness's assiduity in climbing rocks, &c. Up till the time of this visit becoming a certainty by the arrival of Baron Renfrew on board the Mannheim steamer, the Rhenish papers were ex;tremely greedy as to the amount of British Rwoyalty the banks of the Rhine were determined to accommodate this summer. Not only the Prince of Wales, but also Prince Alfred, was to rejoice in Rhenish scenery ; they rented in their journalistic imagination an hotel at Remagen for the Pi;ncess Royal, and did not flinch even at inscribing Queen Victoria herself in the future bcok of visitors, on the presumption that where aO many members of her family were the Royal mother would be sure to be found also. It has, however, been discovered just recently that medical advice and experience had pointed oult that the bricks and mortar of the "KEonig von Preussen," at Remagen, were still too new and dabnp to admit of a Royal Princess taking up her abode within thenm. Most journals of that neighbourhood mention now that the time when hecr Royal HIighness will come to the Rhine is very undecided. The Prussian naval officers who served on board of British vessels of war in the Baltic and Blac<k Sea during the campaign of 1864 have received from our Government the medal that was shiuck to commemorate that event; and the King has already accorded his permission for their accepting and wearing it. The peculiar conical projectile hitherto used in the needle-gun (Ziind-Yadel-gew<ehr) has, as we are given to understand, lately recceived such an advantageous alteration in ihs shape that, at a range of 400 paces (860 ft. English), the greatest accuracy of point blank aim may be attained; and that even at 1,000 paces (2,160Oft.)but a very small amount of elevation is required. ITALY. A letter from Bologna of the 14th inst. informts us that the most respectable inhabitants of Ravenna, Forli, Cosena, and Fcrzara have forwarded addresse3 to the Pope, explaining the melancholy cendition of the inhabitants, and praying for a reform in the administration of the Roman Statea. The address of the inhabitants of Ravenna says- "The laws are imperfcot. The eleslastiesl element predominates. Arbitrary judgments falsify and neutralize tho spirit of the laws, which are good. Wie and liberal reforms, secured from false interpretxtions and restrictions' appear to us the only means of effacing suoch evils." Letters from Genoa, of the 16th inst., speak of a strange fact, which was at first considered an invention, but the accuracy of which was subsequently demonstrated. Towards 10 o'clock of the night of the 14th inst. some persons approached the fort of Quezzi and fired a shot. A Fentinel having given the alarm, the garrison, consisting of a sergeant and 10 men, took arms and occupied the posts. The night was dark, and it was impossible to identify the individuals, who immediately fled. A similar cccurrence took place at Fort Ratti. The Governor sent out a patrol to pursue the fugitives, who followed them as far as Bavari, where the patrol lost sight of them. ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DRSPATCHES. I (FR03 OUR ONVw COBREnPOXDMT S.)

FOREIGN INTELLIGBNCE. FRANCE. (MBOM OUB OWN COaR NDENT.) PARIS, SATUIRDAY, JULY 18, A letter from Salerno of the 12th inst. inforni us that there are in the prisons of that city 150 of the insurgents who landed at Sapri under the command of Colonel Pisacarne, and who were captured after their defeat at Padula. They are to be tried by the Grand Criminal Court of Salerno. The Naples official journal of the 11th inst. eulogizea the devotion and energy with which the scanty population of Sapri and Torraca repulsed the execrable attempt made by the seditious band who landed there. The Urban Guard of Cilento likewise showed the greatest enthusiasm in taking up arms. The Minister of War communicated to the King the zeal, energy, and discipline displayed by the Chasseurs and the Gendarmerie during the late insurrection. The Minister of Marine likewise expressed his satisfaction with the activity and skill of which Vice-Admiral Count Aquila gave proofa, together with the officers of the navy, on the landing of the revolutionary bands at Sapri. The King has returned thanks to the entire population of Calabria for the devotion they showed to his throne tuder the late difficult circumstances. The accounts daily received in Paris from the departments continue to give a most favourable report of the harvest. A letter from MIontbrison, in the department of the Loire} states that the produce of the corn crops in that neighbourhood is double that of last year. One farmer who lives at a place called Belles-Dents has obtained 114 stacks of rye where he had in former years but 50 stacks. Similar accounts hs.ve been received from the arrondissements of St. Etienne and Roanne, where the farmers are beginning to reap wheat. A communication from Perigueux states that the railway from that town to Coutras was approved by the Government engineer on the 11th inst., and wll be opened to the public on the 19th.

The return of the King and Queen to Sans Souci, which was to have taken place yesterday, has been de]ayed for a day by a slight indisposition which affected the King on his arrival at Pillnitz on MIonday evening. It appears that the excessive heat in which His Majesty has of late travelled to and from Vienna, and then from Toplitz to the Saxon capital, had produced an indisposition, for which, however, a cool temperature, rest, and sleep have already provided a sufficient remedy, and their Majesties will return home to-day. The Berlin Committee of the Evangelical Alliance is not behindhand in mnaking its preparations for the forthcoming assembly of Protestant Christians in this city. At a meeting held here last Monday evening the committee was informed by the special deputation appointed to wateh over the subject that pecuniary contributions towards the expenses of the assembly are flowing in to a very satisfactory extent, and that a very considerable number of persons had signified their willingness to accommodate strangers who should come to Berlin to take part in the meeting. The number of guests whom it is calculated Berlin will have to provide for on this occasion is estimated at present at 3,000. Great satisfaction was expressed at the earnestness and zeal felt in England for the cause, as testified by the number and rank of Protestant champions of religious brotherhood that have signified their intention of coming over to the assembly, and the amount already subscribed in England (8001.) towards their expenses. The appeals that have been made by the General Committee of the Alliance in Germany and the Local Committee in Berlin are about to be circulated copiously, and a printer of this town contributes 8,000 copies of them gratuitously. At this meeting also the attention of the committee was very properly drawn to the number of odious insinuations and clever misunderstandings as to the objects of the approaching assembly which its cpponents are most indnstriously spreading from 'heir pulpits and by meaus of the press; and it was I esolved that fotur public lectures shall be delivered here with as little delay as possible explanatory of its true nature and objects. This is a step that cannot be too highly applauded, for men more clever than this ultra-Liutheran party is in misunderstanding, and more unprincipled in the aspersions iteasts upon the object of the assembly and the more prominent members of the Alliance, it is difficult to imagine. At a previous meeting the last London list of the names of gentlemen who bad joined in the Encglish address to the Protestants of Germany, consisting of about 400 of the higher clergy and gentry, among them Lord Shaftesbury, Admirals Brenton, Hoare, and Duff, Revs. G. H. Sumner, M. A., the Hon. Mr. Kinnaird, M. P., &c., wu.,read. The previous list contained about 2,000. Addresses were read which had been received from Wurtembarg and Baden, and even from Constanti;sople, in reply to the general invitation issued by the Protestants of Germany to ccme and meet in lierlin. lanother, from theUnited States, was also commuuieated, bult the list of signatures had not het n tt rdii f with it, as it was stil in circulation there..
IBBLAND. I TIMe TTv :.E4Trmn, (rxom ORl OWN[ ORRO5SPOWDMiT.1 DUBLIN. SA.TURDAYMORNING. lIord John Browne's electoral address has been issued. His Lordship promises to give an independent support to the present Government so long as it retains the confidence of the country. This means anything or nothing. Upon the religious or great Maynooth question Lord John is a little more explicit.

The model county of Down, since the 12th of July, has been disgraced by a series of the old party riots, which it was hoped had long since been forgotten. Mr. Justice Jackson, in opening the commission at Downpatrick yesterday, was compelled to draw the attention of the grand jury to the shameful revival of party feuds in the county:- " There are no fower than 40 serious casea on this book now betore me, and among these are several for party processions. lotwithstanding the number of prosecutions that have hitherto taken place under the Act prohibiting these processions, they are persevered in, and always lead to grevous results in various ways. An Act was passed in the 13th year of the present Queen's reign, reciting most truly that the practice of having processions of this description through the country was calculated to disturb the public peace and to produce animosity among the people, and might-indeed, often did-lead to the sacrifice of human life. Now, it is a grievous thing that, after all these prosecutions have taken place, and alter all exertions have been tried to induce the people to give up their processions, all these things have been abortive, and they still persevere. I regret to hear that recently, on ihe annivereary of the 12th of July. there have been these processions in many parts of the country, and that in Eo ne instances they have been followed bv loss of life. Now, in the present instances these party pro. cessions are on the part of perEons calling thomselves Protestan's, and who are proud to he so considered. Ihope that being a Protestant means being a Christian man; and, unquestionably, it is one of the first duties of a Christian man to obey the law of the land. It might have been right, rerhapsn u least innocent, in foamer times to have had these nzoeassions if they were not attended by breaches of the isace, and if they were not attended by the oausequeWces that have latterly occurred- bat once tho Legislature las pronounced that thoy ought to be discontinued, it would be the duty of every man calling himself a Pro. !testai and a Christian man to obey the lsw of the lanZ,. and 1D abstain from these processions which have such cosequances."

I 43 The travels of nI TrOeat F,'e have indeed been extensive. When Mr. W. Cooke, of Astley's, having made "Shakrpeare" ride on horseback for about two seasons, resolved to furrpish the lyrical drama likewise with equestrian aupport, n Jrovatore was the Srst work selected for his experiment. The operatic season having duly set in at the Surrey the same work hasbeen produced, under the superintendence of Mr. Tully, and is executed in very creditable style. The chief novelty connected with this performanco is the appearance of Mr. Henry Squires, a yoUng tenor of much promise, in the popular character of Manrico. He has a chest voice of great compass, well suited to thegentle strains of the romantic troubadour, which he sings with taste and feeling, though ho lacks force for the more violent demonEtrations of passion. His masterpiece is the air in the famous IMiserere," in which the qualityof his organ and his power of expression are displayed to perfection, and which is, of course, encozed. Leonora is represented by Lucy Escott, who exerts aU her energies to give force to the passionate utterances of the character, piercing the ears of her audience with tho revclations of her gief, and acting with an abandance of gesticulation that contrasts greatly with the quietude of Mr. Squireo whose proficiency as an actor is not equal to his accomplishments as a vocalist. Mr. Charles Dorand goes quietly and tastefully through the rrusic of the Count di Luna, earning for " I1 balen" the encore which justly belongs to it, and looking certainly the most unraffled persecutor that ever burnt a Gipsy or beheaded a wandering minstrel. The most finished performance in every respect is the Azucena of MissLanza, who Inot only sings the music in artist-like style, but acts in a free, unconstrained manner that happily avoids both tameness and exaggeration. The choruses are execated with great spirit, and the manner in which the whole work is done shows high talent for organization on the part of the irusical director. He finds his reward in an enthusiasm among the audience that is most remarkable considering the warmth of the weather.
CREMORNE GARDENS. This season Cremorne co mbines a vatiety of amusement that completely throws into the shade all the manager's previous efforts, successful as they ever were. From about 5 o'clock in the afternoon to 12 at night someth;ug or other is going on in one of the vast edifices that are dotted about the premises, to say nothing of miscelaneous curiosities, such as "sea hons" and monkeys, cosmoramas, games of all descriptions, and the amusement afforded by the garden itself, which, decorated with statues and fountains, presents some new object at the end of every dozen yards. It is tho peculiar advantage of Cremorne to be equally fitted for the qtiet recreations proper to daylight, aud that more p:onounced hilarity that scarcely is in season before nightfall. A stroll about the grounds, and over the bridge, with tho chance of an occasional balloon on a gala-day, wil satisfy tke lover of early bours, who will wind up his innocent enjoyments by a sober "tea" in one of those Arcadian retreats called boxes. Tho ballet in the saloon, the feats of the equestrian circle, the performances at the Marionette Theatre, the glories of the fireworks, and the joys of the monster platform are for the recreation of the later comers and the later stayers, though even some of these are occasionaUy adapted to the convenience of early patrons. The most important addition to the gardeu is the 3arionette Theatre, which is a theatre to all intents and purposes, with pit, boxes, and a spacious stage, presenting a fagade of the gayest and lightest appearance to the ontside spectatcr. Great perfection has been attained in the working of the marionettes, which even opon their mouths to convey the notion of actual discourse, and go triumphantly thro sgh the action of a somewhat intricate piece. The dresses of these puppets are briliant in the extreme, and when the drama is of the spectacle kind the scenery is most gorgeous, and complicAted effects of machinery are introduced. Moreover, the present proscenium can be removed, so as to adapt the stage, if required, to the performances of living fuTlgrown actors, The ballet at Cremorne has always been remarkable for the taste with which it is produced and tho talent of the artists, but it has a peculiarity that distinguishes it from aU works of a similar clss, and connects it with the entertainments of former days. Indeed it is not so much a ballet in the modern sense of the word as what used to be caled a " a pantomime of action," with a comic story at its foundation, allowing room for the display of much gratesnue humour. Every season brings with it a new balet, but the principle is never varied. Among the extra items of attraction are a wise dog, that exhibits the erndition formerly deemed peculiar to " leared pig.," and a little girl, termed the IIMagnetic Wonder," vho professes to have the power not only of Mesmer, but of the loadstone. A young brother who is sent to sleep and rolled about the floor at her good will and pleasure is the victim of her proficiency, and she has a singular facility in moving the heavy fiat-iron called by tailors a -goose " without the muscular action deemed necessary for the proceSs. The theory, of course, is that " magnetic fluid" is the opera. tive agent. We merely state effects without diving into The most heedless spectator who reflects that so many amusements, spread over so large an extent both of space I and time, result from the enterprise of one individual can scarcely refuse his tribute of admiration. Cremomne is a great work of art, or rather of many arts.

PROTECTEON TO PABENTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-A fewr months ago you were invited to decide upon the merits of a controversy between the authorities at Eton College on the one hand, and the parent of& boy who was dismissed for refusing to be flogged for a wilful breach of discipline on the other. You decided in favour of the authorities, and I think you decided rightly. It was neces sary to put a stop to the practice of smoking, and a certain penalty was attached to the commission of that offence. A boy might consider himself old enough to indulge in a cigar, and too, old to submit to the birch, but the necessarv inference would be, that it was time for him to leave school and cultivate his manuly tastes elsewhere. My object, however, on the present occasion is not to reopen this controversy, but to call your attention, and that of parents in general, to another phase of school disciDline, in which the ruling powers at Eton and Winchester appear to me to have acted in a most arbitrary manner, if they have not altogether exceeded the bounds of their legitimate authority. It has been the custom for many years past-some 30 or 40 at least-for the "Elevens"? of-En, Harrow, andWinchester to play their annual cricket matches at " Lord's" at the commencement of the. summer holydays; and everyone who knows the value of this manly and truly English game, both for the physical vigour which it creates, andforthe moral qualities which it brings into action, wiUl regret the occurrence of any circumstance calculated to diminish the zeal and energy with which it has been hitherto pursued. Every old Etonian or Harrovian will bear me out when I assert that 20 matches with the ordinary amateur clubs will not supply the stimulus to exertion vhich is afforded by the annual matches between the boys themselves. Two years ago, however, it seems to have occurred to the authorities at Winchester that these Olympic festivities were fraught with mischief to the boys under their control, and with ruin to their parents. The boys, it was alleged, were kept hanging about town for a week or ten days after their vacation had commenced, at the imminent peril of their bodies and souls, and at a frightful expense to their parents, when they ought to be engaged in the more domestic recreation of - teszing their younger brothers and sisters at home. The injured parents, indeed, might be supposed to have some voice in the matter; but woe to the simple-minded gentleman who should fall a victim to such a delusion! " What, dare to forbid your son to play at Lord's,' when the honour of Eton or Winchester requires it? You will be a marked man for hfe, and your son's prospects will be irretrievably ruined. No ; parents require protection against the domination of tho schools, and protection they shall have. With,ut our aid, their boys would soon be-- come the;ix masters ; and what would then become of us anc our discipline? We must stand to our !pupils i oo parent , at home as weU as at school; andif their parents are allowed to indulge them withaday's shooting or hunting in the holydays, !it is the utmost discretion they are fit to be trusted vwith." So reasoned the successors of WiUiam of Wykeham, and their remonstrances found an echo at Eton. I must do the authorities at 'the latter place, however, the justieo to admit that they did not indiscrimiiately adopt. the Wykebamist proposals. On the oontrary. while they acquiesced in the aboltion of tbe natches at "Lord's.' they proposer1 t7 wayof compromise to transfer them - teir respective schoolgrounds, and to provide, mutually, for the care and entertainmeht of the boys who should be sent to represent their respective schools on the occasiono!thematches.hisarraugementwasacceded toon the part of Winchester, and has beenacted upon for the last two seasons by that school and Eton. It was objected to, however, on the part of Harrow, an the ground that " Lord's" was neutral territory, and therefore a fairer place for contests of that nature, an,d t.hat great inconveme nce ni -., ai=, from a large assemblage of old Etonians and Harrovians at either school on such interestin and e;21ting ocslon. The eonseqleonee has been that, neither party giving way, the matches between Eton and Harrow have been discontinued, without any prospect of being speedily resumed. Now, Sir, without claimino to represent those parents who, like myEelf, feel somewhat insulted and aggrieved by these scholastic restrictions upon our parental authority, I wish first to say a word or two upon this point, and, secondly, to suggest a very plain and simple method of getting over the difficulty. In the first place, then, either parents in. general object to the continuance of these holyday matches, or they do not. If they do not, I utterly deny the right of the school authorities to forbid them,-and challenge them to state upon what grounds and to what extent they claim to exercise this sort of control over their pupils, when actually living under their parents' roofs, or, at all events, under their inmmediate protection. How many boys of the same or of different schools axe to be henceforth allowed to meet together at any time during the vacations, and under what circumstances? Supposing any nobleman or gentleman so disposed, might he offer his park for the celebration of these manly pastimes, and would his offer entail the penalty of expulsion on those who accepted it ? These are not idle questions; for, the right of interference under such circumstances once admitted, no one knows to what length it may be carried. On the otherhand, if any considerableproportion of parents object to these matches on the score of inconvenience or expense, they have the remedy in thcir own hands. They can forbid their sons to play. If they have not the moral courage to do this, they are certainly not entitled to any sympathy from thle public; still less are they justified in invoking the aid of the schoolmaster to abridge the liberty of other parents for their own special convenience. As I am more anxious, however, to heal differences than to widen them, I beg to propose the following plan for satisfying the views of the different parties in this controversy. I fully admit that, for the convenience both of boys end parents, it is better that thesematches should be played during theschooltime than inthe vacation. But I am also strongly of opinion that Lord's cricket-ground is the proper battle-field for such contests. It is neutral, easily accessible, and open to aU the world. These aresufficient reasons for its being selected in preference to the playing-fields of the respective schools. Let the boys be sent up by railwray to the scene of action under proper surveillance, and be safely restored to their respective dames and tutors when the game is over. There is really no dificulty about the matter. Solvuntur t"isa tabulr. PATERFAMUI.LS.
AUSIRALN W r.EN.-Froru New South Wales we have received most favourable accounts of the vintage for the present year, which had already commenced in the counties of Cumberland, Camden, Hunter, Darham, and Northumberland, where the chief vineyards of the colony are planted; and most stngulne anticipations are entertained. that In a few Years we may hope to see the names of "Camden Park, IVrawang, Tomago. Lochinvar, Carwarv, Ttxleela," &o., rank as high in the wine-market as LIfitte, Latour, Chatean-Marganx, Sillery, Ay, Romane-Conti, or Chambertin. With repect to any extenzsive exports of Austrahlau wines it is stated that we must entertain no hopes for some years to come. The demand, both in this colony and Victoria, for colonial wines at present exceeded the means of supply. The chief holders of 'ine, it is also reported, would not execute any large order. until next season, when they anticipate a supply of the firest quahty. As regards the present vintage, the wine, with the utmost care, cannot be oxpected to arrive at maturity within the next three years. The stosk on hand fron former vintages was comparatively small; but the steady increase of vineyards in almost every part of the colony promises that vine will before 3on5 become a valuable commodity in the artieles of exportation, and vie in value with its wool, tallow, gold, and coal. The produce of wine during the past year has been estimated aS 170,O0O gallons, only a m port,ion of which has gone boyond the immediate neighbourhood of the respective vneyards, which, however, Tith due care *nd proper slill, might sily produce double the quantity they do at present.-Auvjtam antd Newl Zc-a:and Gazette.

LAW REPORT. COURT OF CHA2NCERY. LIaNcoLx's.TNm. Trn.. iR THE Q1UEE V. LATTrR. (Before the LosD CH"co=.OR. This was a petition of right, and the present application was that the etitOn should be referred to six gen ernen to inquire into tne fact8 therein set forth, folowing the pre. cedent adopted in the case of the Baron de Bode. rs Lee and Ir. Chwahester were for the petition. MIr. WYICRNSs, for the Crown, offered no o~pposition, and The LORD CHACELLOR granted the application. BLACKMBOE v. SNE. This was an appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor Stuart. The question arose under a will, whereby the testator gave certain copyhold and leasehold estates to his widow for life, and directed the same at her death to be sold and the proceeds divided among his four children, or the survivors or survivor of them equaly, share and share alike; or equally to be divided among the survivors of them after the death of the tenant for life. Three of the children died in the lifetime of the tenant for life, aud the plaintiff, who was the survivor, claimed the whole fund. The ViceChanceUor held that the representatives of the three deceased children were entitled to participate, and from that decision the plaintiff appealed. A great number of cases were cited pr-o and con1. Ir. Craig and Mr. Forster appeared for the appellant Mr. Bacon and MIr. Lewin supported the deoree. The LORD CHA.NECELLOP. said the rule of law was that if a tegSator gave property to the children ef A, B, or the s-urvivors or survivor of them, the gift took effect upon those children who were living at his (the testator's) death. If, however, by the will there was the intervention of a tenant for life the distribution of the fund was confined to such children as survived the tenant for life. Such was the rule to be gleaned from the authorities, and it was not requisite to inquire whether the rule was good or bad, as it wvs far better to have a fixed standard to go by than to be always arguing upon ab3tract principles. The rule, however, only applied where no contrary intention wasexpressed in the will, and therefore did not in his (the Lord Chancellor's) opinion govern the present case. It was manifestly the intention of the testator to make provision for aU his children, and it was therefore the duty of the Court to see Euch intention carried into effect. The two clauses in the will, by the first of -which the proceeds were given to the s survivors or survivor of the children equally, share and share alike," and by the other the property was "to be divided equally among the survivors of them after the death of the tenant for life," were rather inconsistent, and, consequently, the Court, in construing them, was hound to look at the original intention of the testator, and not to take the word " survivors" in its ordinary sense. The intention of the testator, as stated before, was to provide for all his children living at his own death, and, there. fore, the construction put upon the will by the Vice-Chancellor was the most rational one, and perfectly consistent with the authorities. Although the vFiU had been drawn by a professional man he evidently did not understand the eflect of the words used; and, if the Court were to speoulate upon the intended meaning of the second clause, it vwould hold that, as tlbo testator's property consisted of copyholds and leaseholds, the legatees were to have the option of taking their gifts in specie. The ap.eal must be dinissed with costs. (Bqefore the LORDS JUSTcmS OP APPEAz.) EX PARTE BUNNY IN RE BUNNY. Mr. SwVAsrTON, upon the opening of this petition, stated that he had a prelininary objection, on the 233d eection of the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act, to its hearing. That section enacts that, if a bankrupt at the time of the adjudication be elsewhere thaninthounitedldngdom, or other part of Europe, shall not, within 12 months after the advertisement of the bankruptoy in the London GazeUe, commence an action, suit, or other proceeding to dispute or annul the fiat or the petition of adjudication, the advertisement shaU be conclusive evidence of the bankruptcy. In the ptesent case the bankrupt contracted debts at Newbury, in Berkshire, and emigrated in 1853 to New Zealand. In1855 a petition for adjudication was presented, founded on his departure from England, being for the purpose of delaying his creditors. Undor a power of attorney executed by the asslgnees, an agent took possession of the goods and other property of the bankrupt, wheroupon he brought an aotion of trespass against the agent in the Supreme Court of New Zealand, The agent demurred to the action, on the ground that the bankraptcy proceedings in England wholly prevented the Supreme Court havingjurisdiction in the matter, which demurrer was allowed, and an appeal from that decision is now under appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Psivy CounciL The learned counsel contended that the action of trespass vras not such an action, suit, or other proceeding " to dispute or annul the fiat on tho petition of adjudication" as was intended by the Legislature under this section, and therefore that the petitioner had no right to be heard against an adjudication, which the Act says shal be dEemed conclusive. Mr. HANNEN, of the common law bar, argued that the colonial court had no jurisdiction whatever to interfere with a bankruptcy in this country, and therefore that the bankrupt had not taken such proceedings as were intended by the statute- namnely, proceedings in E ngland. The cases of the pstnta Thirbalt" (3 Mont, andDe Gex), " Clark v. Mallck" 3Moore's Privy Council Cases), "Drummond v. the Irish Linen Company" (in BarnweU and Cresswell's Reports), and others were cited. The learned counsel contended that if an Englisli court were not the formn intended by the sta ute, the bankrupt might colect all his available property and depart to any country where it might be most conveDient to him to baflle his creditors, and there hold his property against the olaims of his assignees. He admitted that the advertisement was conclusive evidence of the bankruptcy if the action had been properly brought, whioh it was not; for it was never intended that the bankrupt should select any other country than his owin to try the validity of the adjudication. Lord Justice KNIOUT BRUCE said he was surprised to hear such an objection. It was as clear as light that the bankrupt's petition of appeal must go on. Lord Justice TURNER agreed that the objection must bh at once overruled. Mr. DORIA was then hoard on the petition, stating that the adjudication was bad, from the three fundamental easons of there being no act of bankruptcy, no good petitioning creditor's debt, and no act of trading, The evidence on the subject of trading was that a butoher sworo he served the bankrupt and his servants, who nuade bricks, wvith meat, and that the bankrupt adni tted the brickrnaking business was his, but that he did not wish it known. The bankrupt, on the other band, denied that he was a brickmaker, and his brother corroborated that evidence. Divers witnesses in their affidavits swore to dealings in bricke, and accounts were put in from which bankrupt appeared to be the seller of bricks, and receipts wero put in signed " Charles Wheeler for Henry Bunny" for money received on the sale of bricks. The affidavits in reply on the trading by briokmaking were those of the bankrupt, who swore that the brickmaking business was not his but his father's, and that in the accounts the payments mnade for bricks were credited to the father, ard he absolutely denied all dealings on his own account in any other capacity than that of agent for his father, and the receipts were given on account of his father, to whoso credit the moneys were placed; and as to the butcher's account, he denied that the supples wore as sworn. It was, however, sworn, and did not appear to be explicitly dellied, that in the case of settlement of accounts by one person occurred an item of set-off amounting to upvwards of 601. for bricks in favour of the ban-krupt. The bankruxpt positively denitd that (as sworn on the other side) he had ever hield hiraself out as a brickmiaker. The bankrupt's brother also swore that at meetings of the creditors in Newbury the difficulty always arose that the bankrupt was not a trader, so that no adjLdication could be supported if made, and he also swore that the father was, and the bankrupt was not, a brickimaker. The learned counsel argued that the bankrupt could not have held himself out as a brickmaker, or t would be absurd for him to have said (what is sworn) that hie did not wishi it to be knowvn. Their LOIMD-ilus's were of opinion that the holding himself out to the world as a brickimaker had been sufficiently established, and he must so far be deemed a brickmaker, and so adjudicated properly accordingly. lr. DoRitA then proceeded to argue the nuestion of the act of bankrulntcy, which, he said, depended upon the truo conistruction of the G7th section of the Consolidation Act, bY which it is enacte, that the departing the realm and resnaining abroad, with intent to defeat or delay his creditors, shlall he deemned to be an act of banlruptcy; and by the 88th section no person is to be liable upon an act of banikruptcy commiritted more than 12 months before the adjudication. The remaining abroad must be dated from the time when the bankrept showed an intention not to return, as was decided in " Walisi v. Blackwall," before Vice-Chancellor Rindersley; and this intention was rell known to the creditors on the 25th of November, 1853, a fortnight after he had departed, for they knew he Ihad quitted the corutry and gone on board a ship bouend for New Zealand. Lo,rd Justice l?Nm1mIrI BRIJOIL-So that a man has buLt to go abroad-to Boulugue, for instance-and findin~ an adjudication is made against him, he has only to travel oA the continent for a twalvemoith ancd he Is no bankru t, Mr. DORIA. .-That is exactlY so, my lord; but the dis,tinction is that in the case put the creditors would not know of the departure ; here the creditors did well know the fact plre, then, the etition for adjudication being dated oa the 12th of March, 1855, although the departure took place in N~ovember, 185:3, was had, and could not be sustained. The case before Vice-Chancsllor Kindersley appeared to be con. elusive of the case, for if the going was with theo intent to defeat the creditors, that going ate in November, 15333 and the petition for adjudication should have been at latest, at that time in thefollowing year. The learned counsel oxPresed a wrish that the preliminary objection he made as to the form of the peito shudh .cniee asno rO..Ssrated anui reledt upon. Lord Justico KNcIGHsT BRUCE said, that whether the opinion he w as about to express was consistent or incousistent with the case before Vice-Chancellor Kindersley he need not say, but if consistent that case was not touched; If, however, it was inconsistent, with aU respect to that learned judge, his Lordship's view remained the same. The words "beirg out of the realm, shaU remain abroad," must be considered without regard to the motive of going. Wheth er the bankrupt with the intention or without the intention of returlrsg weat abcoad, his remaining was an a Lt of bankruptcy, and every day that he remained abroad, or oftener than eveor day, he committed a fresih act of bankruptcy, his rem aining abroad bring with the intention of defeating or delaying his creditors. As dge his Lordahip could not, upon the facts and evidence b oehm a otherwise than that it was provea that the bankupt did iremain abroad with that intention. Upon none Of the grounds uponL which Mr. Doria had relied, and which he supported so ably before the Couxrt, could his Lordship consent to aDnnul the adjudication. The bankrupt might hiave leave to bring ana action to try the validity of tlie sev-eral objections which had been raised to tho adjudication. Lord Jutstice TURNEP. said that the case decided before Vice-Chancellor Kinderslcy did net reach the uresent it -went on the 60 th section of the Act, ti on the ~7ti section The true construction of "1bei'sg out of the realma shall remain abroad" was, that the words should be read Eepas~Mely, mr.d the intent wvas to be considered with which the act is e.omi. S~o that the words of the latter part of the section should be read a-s applying to each branch Of the preceding 'words. Thu8 his Lordship would read the sectionthus,-" If any trader, being out of the realm, shaU remain abro3d with intent to defeat," &c. In this case It was quite impossible to presume that the bankrupt did not remain abroad with suoh intention, and there was a continuing act of bank. ruptcy every day he so remained. Eis Lordship said he wished not to leave this case without expressing his high sense of the temper, the jud ent, and the ability with which it had been brought before the Court on the part of tho bankrupt.

Mr. SELWYr was heard shortly in reply in this case; after which Lord Justice KmG31T BrtuoE said that the question whether, upon the true construction of the Bankruptcy Law Consolidation Act, the case was brought within the 201st section must be answered in the negative. lb was plain it could not, unless under the words "gaming or wagering" used in that section. It was also alleged that there was no gaming or wagering, unless stock-jobbing acts in Turkish Scrip and Consols amounted to gaming or wagering. It might probably be true that in some sense conduct of such a description might, speaking in popular phrase, be properly so called or characterized. It was another question whether such conduct came within the words of the section as used. Eis Lordship considered that the whole section should be read together and he was satisfied that on reading the whole together, the words of the section could not be so read. However culpable, however destructive of a certificate if granted, they did not bring the bankrupt within the first part of the section to which his Lordship had been referring, and he was of opinion that they formed no ground for refusing' him his carti'icate. the more especially as, if the bankrupt lad been guilty, the certificate, when granted, would not protect him, and if he were deprived of a certificate be would have no power of contesting at law, while, if granted, the creditors would have such right against the granting of the certificate. The Court would decide upon both principlo and authority, not their own, but that of Lord Eldon, in granting a certificate. With regard to the general conduct of the bankrupt, the Court would boar in mind that the acts alleged to amount to gaming or wagering were atocljobbing acts, which in a trader this Court could not overlook. It was true he might have been tempted and that the amounts were small, snd ti e excuse made for him, that he might have committed far more extensive acts, might also be true, and presented an apology, but such conduct could not be overlooked. His Lordship considered that, although he failed for 17,0001., yet there was no fraud, no falsehood, no dishonesty, proved against him. VWhether Mr. Warner or the bankrupt more accurately represented the conversation of November, it was plain that '.he latter did not intend any dishonesty by what he said; he had no dishonest intention. His trading bad no doubt been too extensive, considering his former insolvency and his small or no capital when he recommenced business, and he had been too adventurous; stiU the claims of public and of private justice would, under the particular ciroumstances of this case, be satisfied by a suspensien of the certificate till the 8th of April next, which would be two years from tho adjudication, and then to be of the second class, and there would be no protection until the let of September next. Lord Justice TUsuNxR would give no opinion whatever whether time bargains were "g aming or wagering." The true question was whether they were gaming or wagering within the meaning of the Act of Parliament, and his Lordship considered that they were not. He agreed In the decision which had been pronounced.
I VICE-CHANCELLORS'COURTS. SATurVDiy. JuLv 19- IN RE THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK, XX PARTZ BROWK- NVELL. I1p?fdr V;rM-nZ .Q. lP T1' v ;Sir F. KELLY and Mr. GLASSE appeared upon this adjourned summons from chambers for the official manager, and said that tbis was in point of form an application to put the name of Mr. Brockwell on the list of contribatories In the winding-up of the Royal British Bank. The facts of the case, although there was a great deal of paper, lay within a very narrow compass, and were extremely short and simple, the contention being that this gentleman was not a shareholder in the company- he was the holder of three shares only. The original shareholders in1855 were holders of shares to the amount of 100,0001., afterwards increased to 300,0001., and therefore more than two-thirds of the capital had been raised since 1855. The company was instituted in 1849, and the capital, real or nominal, was represented by a subscribed capital of 50,0001., half the amount of theshares. Early inl855a newoharterwas obtained,whereby the above increase of capital took place. In March, 1855, Mr. Brockwdvll became a subscriber for three shares of 1001. each. He was returned and registered, and in June paid his 501. per share deposit. In December, or after, upon a half-yearly dividend being declared, he, liko others, received his dividend. In June, 1856, ho again received a dividend. In 0eptember following the bank stopped payment, and it was umnecessary to say more upon that circumstance, it belog a matter of public notoriety. When proceedings had been taken in the Bankruptcy Court MTr. Brockwqil, in November, 1856, having discovered the real naturo of transactions and state of the bank, insisted that he had not legally become a shareholder; the purchase having been obtained by fraud, he was entitled to recover his subscription, as money had and received to his use, as if he had purchased a horse on a false representation that it was sound, and the company being no longer solrent, he proceeded to prove his debt against the company in bankruptcy. On the other hand, if the contraet was valid, of courso he could not prove the debt. No doubt existed on the facts that Mr. Brockwell was a shareholder, but he charged this kind of fraud. This company, lile others, made a series of annual reports-one for the year 1853 and 1854, somewhat voluninous, containing a great mass andvariety of figures, to which it was unnecessary to refer, but there were two items in the report of 1854 which were prominent ones. These were loans on convertible securities for short periods, advances, discounts, &o., 804,7981. 16s. 7d., the other item being a statement of the balance in hand as 38,3711. 13s. This first was said to be a great exaggeration of the truth, made up of debts long treated as bad, &c., and, let it bo so for the sake of the argument, the same might be said of the second item. And now came the question of how this was made out to be a fact. It appeared that these reports got into circulation, some into the newspapers, and Mr. Broekwell stated that (being a depositor in the bank since 18.52) when he called at one of the establshments he was shown one of these reports, and this was all. The important point was that it ii not the fraud and misrepresentation by the company, or any one under its authority, but a report made by the directors, and countersigned by the auditor, to the then existing shareholders, and for their guidance, and therefore a misrepresentation by the directors to the shareholders, and to them alone ; and it therefore camoe to this,-that if the holders of 2,000 shares could show that such false representation was read by them, or shown to them in the shaue of this report, they could say they were not shareholders. It was not an act by the authority of the deed, or mass of shareholders, although it might be that these reports were circulated and came to Mr. Brockwell's ears by means of some individual, the statement being made to and not by the company, and therefore an act to which the shareholders could not be parties. It was to be contended on the other side that this was the statement of the company to the public, by persons acting by the authority of tho company. This arose upon the relation between the company and the directors. Thero was no authority in the deed of settlement to nmake any representation, and was it to be implied? The shareholders, in 1855 would rather have been inclined to keep the large gains to themselves, instead of publishing the means of increasing tho number of shares. It appeared that the resolation at a general meeting for the increase of capital bore date in 1850, five years, therefore, before the report ; and if in 1850 such a resolution was passed, and in 1854 the directors made a false report, and thus carried out the resolution, upon what ground could it be said that such a report, made before the new shares were enthrely issued, could have relation back to the resolution ? The one act had nothing to do with the other; assumirg that Air. Brockwell was thus induced, so were the 2,000 shareholders who, with the other 2,000, continued an undistinguishable body, so that for the wholeofthedividendsin1855andl856(two-thirdsofthewhole) received the slhareholders now claimed a dissolution from a year and a half ago; and this complication would arisethat the holders of old and nevw shares would be their own receivers, and claim in respect of their misrepresentation. It was a perfectly novel idea, which had been tried a-d failed, as appeared upon the autborities. If Mr. Brockwell had been defrauded by anyone whomsoever, and had, in reliance upon tbem, urechased these shares, that contract, int(r se, would be void; but if by three or four directors of the company he bad a remedy against those three or four, but had no claimu by action or otherwise against the company. The leading case upon this point was a decision of the Lord Justice Knight Bruce in ' Dodgson's Case" (3, De Gex and Smale, 85), and it was there held that directors frandulently inducing a person to take shares might be, and were, liable personally, but not involving the company. Another case was t at of "Ex parte Barnard" (21, L. J., 468 and 5, De Gex and Smale), and there the Vice-Chancellor Parkes referred to " Dodgson's Case," and recognized that decision. In " Bell's Cnse" (22, Beav. 35) the company was virtualy insolvent, and the party's name was struck off the list, wbore the shares were absolutely void. "Ex parte Ginger" (5, I-lsh Chan. rep., 174) also showed the principle, althongh not otherwise bearing on the present case. The offect of deciding in favour of Mr. Brockwell's contention would be to throw the affairs of companies in this position into the greatest uncertainty and confusion. In " Ex parte Henderson" (26, L.J., 120)execution was issued against a shareholder, and Lord Campbell, after commuanicating with the otber judges, stated that they aU concurred in the view that a party who had held himEelf out to the world as a partner could not repudiate the character of a shareholder on the ground of fraud as against the other shareholders. The dates of the facts were admitted, and the-o was no doubt that if any one was deceived it was the parties to whom the representation was made ("Holt's Case," 17, Beav., 48). Upon these grounds Mr. Brockwell must be put upon the list of contributtories. Mr. W. D. LEWIS appeared on the same side, and argued that, all the alleged fraud being assumed, unless it could be proved that it was the act of all the shareholders, Mr. Brockwell could not succeed in Isis contention. The learned gentlenman then referred to the cases already cited, and also to "M oran's Case,"whieh carried out the ground of those decisions, both afftrmatively and negatively. Everything done by Mr. Brockwell was with the directors, and it was the same case as of one partner of seven misrepresenting to one of the other six. The VICO-CHANCELLOR asked whether there was not a prohibition to proprietors to inspect. Sir F. K FLLY said that there was. The ATTORIacY.GEN-ERAL and Mr. G. M. CsIPIARD appeared for Mi-. Brockwell. This case had been selected to try this question, which was important, and had been argued at length, there not being anv authority directly in point. If a man was mnade an agent to negotiate, and he put forth every species of fraudulent representation, yet if he did so without the knowledge of his prncipal it was for a long time held by courts of law that I he principal was not liable, but that law had happily ceased to be recogiized. The directors were the managers of this cormppany, which was desirous of increasing its capital, aud the directors determined to issue accounts containing false representations to induce persons to take shares, and Mr. Brockwell was one of those who were thus booked. The argument was that such a fraud wouLd be perpetrated with impunity, and unjust g%ins enjoyed, because authority was not proved. It might as well be said that a highwayman could be furnished with the means of following his calling, but that the party so farnishing him could not be liable because he was not privy to tke actual perpetration of his deeds. ("H Holford v. Falk," 6 Meee. and Welsby.) Would a court of equitv enforce sach a contract? Certainly not. Look at the common ense of the matter. An agent goes into the marketk strictly enjoined to make true representations; he deals with a party upon an attractive representation, which allures the purchasers, and being false could it be said that it would eaure for the benefit of the principal? It could not. This subje t 'was very recently discussed in "The National Exchange Company of Glasgow v. Drew," 2 Macqueen, 103, where it was eold that acompanycould only act by its directors, who were representing the body, and a fraud by them was a fraud by the aggregato boay, although the individuals cow . posing it were ignorant of it; and the Lord Chancellor had met the very argument adduced in this case with respect to the report, expressing it as his opinion that as between the directors and third persons the reports and representations contained therein were required bythe exigencies of society to be taken as the acts of the company. By the 7th and oth of Victoria, cap. 113, sec. A, it was enacted that the directors of a bank, once in every calendar month, should render an account of the assets and liabilities. In Easthope's Case, "The %&mazon Life Assurance Coin pany," 27, L. T. 195, his Honour had decided exactly in accordance with the view taken in the case. in tbe Rouse of Lords, in which ca8e a party not having tho money to purchase shares had the money lent him by the company upon his bond, and went into the market and bought shares, and yet upon proof of fraudulent representations as the inducement he was absolved from both liabilities. In re the Tipperary Bankl (1, Irish Jur., NT.S., p. 373, and 2, iid., 221), "' Caskett's Case" (2 Jur., N.S.), " Sutton's Case-Australian Bank" (3 De Gex. and Smale, 262), when the company commenced business, and at the time of the alleged con. tract they were not carrying on business legally under the Gth section of the Banking Act (7th and 8th of Victoria, CBap. 113), inasmuch as neither the requisite subscription nor concert was obtained, as was stated to the Board of Trade, snd that appeared upon the face of the supplemental charter. .The Attoriiey-General then proceeded to read the evidence of dlr. Edward Esdailoe, whereby it appeared that the shares represented to be paid upon were not paid in cash, but some of them owing on promissory notes and some never p aid. Part of the 50,0001. was remuneration to the directors themselves, and hopeless debts were entered in after balance. isheets, and not only so but interest was computed upon the same footing. The evidence then went into a detailed ac. fcount of good, doubtful, and bad debts, showing, as was contended, a vast amount, which items were imported from time to time into the successive reports, printed and extensivel, circulated among the shareholders, besides being ,inserted in the city articles of the newspapers. ;The depositions then contained the minutho of the ,general management of the accounts and the obtaining of thesecond charterbyrneansof amemorlal, and spoke of the general knowledge of the directors of the constant accumulation of bad debts, being aware that if the rigid truth were known before the new shares were granted the bank would be thereby stopped' The excuse was that it was unfair to load the first years of the bank with the losses, -when inexperience of the offlcials and the class of customers had caused them. This was the conduct which was now sought to be treated as a white-robed and honest thing, and not complaining of the manner in which the offici manager had conducted his duty and had been represented. was it just that such a thing should be permitted to be taken advantage of ? At this stage of the case the Court rose, and the matter wil be resumed on Wednesday next. (Before Vice-Chancellor Sir J. STUART.) IN IRE LAW.-BYERS V. ADAMS. This case came before the Court on an adjourned suammons from the Vice-Chancellor's chambers. The quession was 'whether a principal who had employed an agent to make a bet on a racehorse, and which bet had been won and received by the agent, could prove the amount of the wager as a debt against the estate of the agent,which was In a course of administration under a decree of the Court. The late Mr. Henry Towry Law had beon employed by Mr. Arkell to back a horse called Little Davie;which was entered to run for the Warwick Handicap at the Warwick Spring Meeting, in March, 1853. Law accordingly backed little Davie, which ran and won the race, and Law thereby won and received 1001. as the amount of the bet which he had been instructed by Arleell to take on behalf of the latter but he did not pay that sum over to Arkell. Arkell sought to prove for the amount against Law's estate, but the chief clerk bad disallowed Arkell's claim. By the 8th and 9th Victoria, cap. 109, sect. 18, it is enacted, "that all contracts or agreements, whether by parol or in writing, by way of gaming or wagering, shall be null and void; and that no suit shaU be brought or maintained in any court of law or equity for recovering any sum of money or valuable thing alleged to be won upon any wager, or which shall have been deposited in the hands of any person to abide the event on which any wager shall have been made," provided that such enactment shall not apply4o any subscription towards any plate, prize, or sum of money to be awarded to the winner or wnnners of any lawful game, sport, pastime, or exercise. Mr. Malins and Mr. Quain appeared in support of the claim; and Mr. Wigram and Mr. Tripp resistea it. The ViCE CHANCELLOR said there was considerable difficulty in the case, but that difficulty arose according to his view more from the decisions at law than from theo visions of the before-naentioned statute. The statuteohad said in the plainest terms that courts of law and equity should not countenance actions or suits instituted for recovering sums of money or valuAble things alleged to have been won on any wager. Arkell's demaand was for 1001., won not by Law, but by himself. The demand, therefore, was made by the winner of the wager for the thing won. The statute did not say that no suit in equity should be allowed by the winner of a wager against a loser, for th3 word " loser" was not mentioned, but it was prohibitory of the right of the winner. That settled the question, uniess the true construction of the Act wero that no action at law or suit in equity ehould be brought against the loser for the recovery of any sum alleged to have baea won on a wager. It had been said that, although there was no mention in the statute of the term " loser of a wager," the money in the present case had been paid over to a third party, who held it as money belonging to the winner, without reference to the circutmstances under whicoi it was won. There was, however, no just ground for that view. The statute was prohibitory against the winner, and the moment he proceeded in eqouty to recover the wager he did that very thing which the statute forbade. It had, however, been held at law that where a person who received money on behalf of the winner of a wager gave apromissory note or accepted a biUl of exchangeo for the amountthe moneymight be recovered. He could onlyaccount for such a decision on the principle that the money would be recovered on a bill of exchange as on a legal consideration. In the present case it might be said that the money came into Law's bands on a contract as valid as that on whici a bill of exchange might be founded, because he could only receive it for the purpose of handing it over to Arkell thi winner of the wager, and that it was as much Arkel's money as if Law had accepted a biU of exchange; but he did not feel himself justified in extending a decision ia reference to a bill of exchange to a case in which there w ts no bill of exchange. He thought the present case within the language of tho Act, and the certificate of the chief clerk disallowing Mr. Arkell's claim must stand.

SUlMMERA SSIZES. ROhIF flTRlTTTrPi CHELMSFORD. JuLy 1i7 (Before thc LORD CHIIEF BAIiON and a Special Jury.) TuE QUEE, ON THE PRosEcuTioN OF JOIN HILLS, V. JOHN CUTTS ANiD ROBERT ZZIEL SMITHL This was an indictment removed from the Crown side of the Court by cartiorari, which charged the defendants, under the statute of the 12th and 13th of Victoria, comnonly knownas the Bbshop of Oxford's Act, with having conspired together and by false pretences induced one 1 Martha Aungusta Hllls, a girl nnder the age of 21 years, to I av7e illicit carnal connexion with the defendant Roberb Mr. hL Chambers, Q.C., Mr. Lush, Q.C., and Mr. T. Chambers appeared for the prosecution; Seraeaut Shee and Mr. Woollett defendMr. r. Cutts; and Mr. Prentice was counsel for the other defendant. This case stood over from the spring assizes, upon an application made on behalf of the prosecution that Martha AugustaHills,the principal witness, was expected to be brought to bed every hour, and was consequently unable to attend and give evidence. MIr. hI. Cst.&asnge, in opening the case for the prosecution, said that the circumstances under which the charge waspreferred were of a very peculiar character. The defendant Mr. Catt6 had for a great many years carried on the profession Of an attorney in the county of Essex, and was a man of considerable wealth, residing at Little Bardfield-hall; and Mr. Smith, the other defendant, was an extensive farmer at Finchingfield, and also reputedto be awealthyiman. It appearedthat in 1854 Mir. Iills, the prowecutor, took a small farm near Mr. Smith. He had a daughter named Martha Augusta, who was at that time 16 years old, and a girl possessed of very considerable personal attractions, and she speedily attracted the attention of Mr. Smith, who was very much older than the young lady, and he went to her father's house, expressed a desire to become acquainted with the family, and he ultimately made the young lady a promise of marriage, and was received in the family as her acknowledged suitor, and it was arranged that the marriage should take place from his house. The young ldy under these circumstances used to go to Mr. Smith occasionally, and in 1855 he succeeded in sedueing her, and she subsequently gave birth to a child. It appeared that Miss Hills during the year 1855 resided for some time at the defendant's house, but she returned to her father's house, and upon her informing her parents of what had occurred they consulted a professional gentleman named Shepherd, and he subsequently brought two actions, oine for seduction and another for breach of promise of mar. riage, against Mr. Smith, on behalf of the young lady. While the proceedings were pending Mr. Cutts, who was acting as the attorney for Mr. Smith, communicated with Mr. Shepherd with a view that some arrangement might be come to betwveen the parties, and after some negotiations had taken place Mr. Shepherd consented to take a sum of 501. for the costs that had been incurred in the actions, and to discontinue all further proceedings, hut upon one concition only, which was this-that Mr. Smith should enter into an agreement to marry MKIiss Hills within two months. Daring these negotiations Miss Hills, it appeared, returned to the house of the defendant Smith, and on the 21st of October, in consequence of a letter they seceived, she and her mother and father went to hlr. Cntts's office, and the proceeding then took place that was the subject of the present inquiry. Mr. Smith and Mr. Cutts, it appeared, were both present, and a paper wasshown to 3r.and Ms. HiUs,which purported to be an agreement on the part of the former to marry their daughter, and they were asked to sign it, but they refused and left the office, their daughter remainingbehindalone wlththe defendants. The youngladv s hehad stated,had had achildduringtheinterourse that had taken place between her and the defendant Smith, and she was evidently impressed with the disgraceful character of their connexion, and she upon this occasion positively declared that she would never go back to Mr. Smith's house to occupy the position she had done. A written paper was then shown to her, which was afterwards placed in an envelope and sealed up, and Mr. Cutts then handed it to her and told her that It was a good and valid agreement on the art of Mr. Smith to marry her after a certain time nad elapsed, and upon tho faith of this statement Miss agai returned to the house of Mr. Smith and continued to cohabit with him. Shortly after these proceedings had taken place the mother of Miss Hills asked her daughter to let her see the agreement, but she told her that she had been requested not to let any one see it, and refused to do so. The agreement was, however, at length obtained, and upon it being shown to Mr. Shepherd he at once pronounced it to be utterly worthless, and that it did not in any way bind Mr. Smith to the performance of his promise to marry Mtiss Hills. Theolearned counsel then read the agreement in question, which was as follow s:- "An agreement mado tbis 31t dayo October, 1S6, between Robert Ezeldel Smith, of Fubchiotlield, farmer, on the one part, and MarthA Ausgsta HIills of -, svpinster, on the other Dart. Whereas an action ls now pending in e1r Majesty's Court of Common Fleas, In which the said Mwtbha Angutta Heitllss peiantill, and the said Ribert Ezekiei Smith Is defendant, and whereas It has teen agreed between the parties that Each actlon shall be discontinued upon the terus following:-Now,itisagreedtbat the said Rebert Ezekiel SmitshalU par au the coats incurred by the said Martha Augusta ills ln the said nction, and the said Marha Augunta Hills erebe rees to return to Coleman(thereoideuee of Smitb) and retide with thezaidRobert Ezekiel Smith as beretoeore. And, lastly, tho said Robert Ezeoiel Smith hereby rroui-es and agreee to may the said Martha Astgusta Hills within eisht calendar months from this date, prolidedalwala and it is exprezaly agreed between the pastles that this agreement, and al obligations couttaibed in it, shal be null and Void, If the agreement, or any cops thereof. he shown to the attorney or otber legal adviser Of the sai Mahtba Ausn,ts HlleM the sa3d agreement being entered into voluntar 1 by the eaid Robert lzekiel Smith." Mr. Chambers then proceefded to state that the present prosecution was founded upon this agreement, and he said he should be prepared to contend that it was a fraudulent proceeding altogether; that the defendant Cuttslknew well at the time that the agreement was illegal, and was of no value, and that he thereby fraudulently induced the young lady to return to the house of Smith, and, in the language of the statuto, by false pretences had induced her to continue to have carnal connexion with him, and that both of the defendants had thereby brought themselves within the scope of the Act. of Parliament, Mr. Serjeant S here interposed, and said that, so far from the agreement in question not being of any force or value, the contrary had been proved, for Mr. Smith had, in point of fact, married the young lady. Mr. CuluiBERs said no doubt that since these proceedings Mr. Smith had married Miss Hills, but the question for the jury was whether this was the original object, and whether the agreement was not intended as a fraud upon Miss Hills to induce her to continue her disgraceful connexion nith the defendant, and whether Mr. Cutts had not merely acted as the go-between for that object. The learned counsel then proceeded to state that the monment Mr. Shepherd saw the agreement in question he at once preferred an indictment, which was found by the grand jury, and the case would have come on for trial at the last assizes but for the illness of Miss Hills; and since that timo Mr. Smith, most probably in consequence of the proceedings that had been taken by Ar. Shepherd, had married the young lady. This circumstance had, however, created a difficulty in carrying out the prosecution, because it was doubtful whether, as her husband was one of the defendants, Mrs. Smith could be called upon to give evidence against him. He therefore proposed to consent to a verdict of acquittal being taken so far as regarded Mr. Smith, and he should then proceed with the case against Mr. Cutts, who, it appeared to him, was the most to blame in the transac. tion, and vbho, as an attorney, ought to have known better than to mix himself up with such a proceeding. The LORD O11EF BARON inquired whether Mr. Cutts did not appear to have acted aU along as the attorney for Mr. Smith. Mr. CuAmDtERs said no doubt he had, but he was still liable for the consequences of any criminal act he might have committed. The LO1D CHIEF BARON observed that if Mr. Cutts had done wrong there were other modes of punishing him, with. out having recourse to such a proceeding as this. Mr. CHAMBERS said he could not withdraw from the prosecution, and he again asked his Lordship to permit the suvgtstion he had made, to take a verdict of not guilty in the case of Mr. Smith, and to proceed against Mr. Cutts only, when Misa Hillss evidence would be clearly admis sible, to be carried out. The LORDD CHIEF BARON said there could be no doubt that so far as Mr. Smith was concerned thero had been a c mplete condonation of the offence by his marrying the y .ung lady, and he put it to; the learned counsel whether hothought, under the circumstances, as he had disclosed them in his opening to the jury, it would not be great cruelty to the young lady, and if any prospect of domestic happiness for her existed, the proceeding of calling her as a witnes; would not tend entirely to destroy that prospect, and that therefore the matter ought not to proceed any fur. thor. MIr. CIrAsIRERs said that he fel'.t the force of the obser vatiorns that had been made by the learned iudge, but he was bound by his instructions to proceed against Mr. Cutts, and he should be compelled to call Mrs. Smith to give evideses. The LORD CHiEF BARON then said he should tako upon himself, not only as a matter of law, but also having regard to tbe public interest and the feelings of the parties, to decide tbat Mrs. Smith was not a competent witness. If she were examined at all she must give evidence equally against her husband as against Mr. Cutts, and he should therefore rule that she could not bo examined. Mr. CHAMBERS said, as this was his Lordship's opinion, it would be useless for him to proceed further or to caU any evidenc-, as the case rested almost entirely upon the evidence of the young lady, who was the only person present when the a,,reement was given. T'he jury then returaed a verdict of lfot Guilty. Mir. PRENTICE, when the verdict had been delivered, rose ard iaid that on behalf of his client he felt called upon to state that there was no foundation for the charge made against him, and that the only object of the prosecution was to cx'ort money. Mr. CIIA,UBERS said the learned counsel had no right to make such an assertion, and it was entirely without foundation. Serjeant SiiEr said that, as his learned friend had made statewuents against his client which were entirely without fonr.dation, and which wouldin allprobability go forth to the public, and they had no opportunity of answering them, bethought it right to state that if there had been such anI opportunity afforded they could have shown that Mr. Catts had acted in the most proper and honourable manner throughout the wihole transaction. The learned serjeant was about to make some further observations, when Mr. CHAalBEUS interposed and objected to his doing so, and the learned JUDGE observed that the matter was at an end, and no more had better be said. Serjeant SiIEs then saidthathe would yield tothe opinion of the Court, and would only say this, that so far from Mr. Cuts having any intention to deceive or take advantage of the young lady, he was proud of having been the means of bringing about her marriage with Mr. Smith, and this was the object of all his proceedings. The defendants then left the Court. This case was not brought to a conclusion until late on Thureday evening, and it was the last case for trial at these assizes. The commission for tho county of Sussex will be opened on Monday at Lewes.
OXFORD CIRCUIT. WOROESTER. JTTV 1 iMr. Baron Martia arrived in this city yeatorday, and opened the commission for the county of Worcester. Hlis Lordship afterwards attended Divine service at the cathedral. The business of the assizes commenced this morning Mr. Baron BramweU presiding in the Civil Court, and Mr. Baron 3lartin in the Criminal Court. Mr. Baron Martin took his seat in court at 10 o'clock, but, as is usual on this circuit, the Civil Court did not sit till 12. The cause list contains an entry of seven causes, one of which is marked for a special jury. The calendar contains a list of 52prisoners. 10 of whom are charged with riot, arising out of the late Yidderminster election. It is understood that indictments are to be preferred against other parties In addition to thobe whose names appear in the calendar. The other offinces charged are of the ordinary description. FRIDAY, JuLY 17. CIVm COURT.-(Before MIr. Baron BRAWTLwst and Corn. enon Jury.) MI'NS V. YARDLRY AND OTHERS. Mr. Serjeant Pistt and Mlr. Phipson appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Huddleston, Q.C., and Mr. Scotland for the defendants. This was aD action of trespass for breaking and enteriug a close of land belonging to the plaintiff at Oldswinford. The defendant pleaded " Not guilty," and also that the land in question was not the plaintiff's close. It appeared that the action was brought to try the right to a small triangular piece of land, situate in the middle of four ways, near Oldswinford, and which was only valuable to the parties as a place for a dung-heap. The trial occupied a large portion of yesterday and several hours this morn- Mgr. Baron BRAWEtLL, in summing up, said it was to bo regretted that the present action had been brought respecting such a trumpery piece of land; but stil it was the duty of the jury to decide the question, though it wvs a very entaDgled one. His Lordsbip having summed up the evidence with great minuteness, the jury eventually found a verdict for the defendants. THM XIDDE5UlBTER RIOTS. Two bils have been found against parties engaged in the Kidderminster riots, and several have been thrown out by the grand jury. The criminal business bas made but little progress at present, and, as Mr. Baron Bramwell is likely to be fully occupied with the civil business, it seems almost certain that it will become necessary to postpone the trial of the rioters till the next assizes. To-morrow (Saturday) is eommission-day at Stratford, and it is probable that the trdinazy circuit business will owcupy the judges the whole of the time allottedl for this county.
NORFOLK CICUIT. BE3DFORD PPhAv -T-m 1i7 The two courts were opened this morning at 10 o'clock, there being three common jury causes entered on the one Aide, and a calendar containing six prisoners. The principal cases were one charge of manslaughter, one of fortery, one of obstructing a railway train, and one of elony. The calendar was disposed of in the course of the say, some of the bils having been thrown out, while in others the prisoners pleaded guilty. CROWN COURT.-(Before Mr. JusticeCWMArs.) John Thang Elarradine was indicted for forgery. ; Mr. Metcalfe conducted the case for the prosecution. The prisoner was undefended, and requested the learned ijudge to assign him counsel, pleading his poverty. Hais Lonasmsp, however, declined to accede to the request of the prisoner, on the ground that such a course was unnusual except in cases of mnurder. The prisoner was a farmer, but faling into bad clroumstances resorted to bill transactions to retrieve himself, and in the course of this career committed several forgeries, which have been the subject of civil proceedings both in London and at Cambridge. The prisoner eventually absconded, and was supposed to have escaped to America Recently, however, he made his appearance in this cotuty, wibere ho was apprehended, tried, and convicted on a charge of horse stealing, for which offence he was sentenced to seven years' transportation, and detained on the more serious charge of forgery. The present case was clearly established against him, and he was sentenced to 14 years' penal servitude. Jesse Plumber, aged 17, was indicted for manslaughter. Mr. Yillis appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Tozer defended the prisoner. It appeared that the prisoner had charge of two carts which were going along the street at a leisurely pace, when the second cart fell behind, and the prisoner left the first to whip up the second cart. While so engaged the horse of the first cart knocked down a child who was playing in the road, and both carts went over her and killed her on the spot. On this state of things his LORDSHIP directed the jury to acquit the prisoner. NmsI PRiuS COURT.--(Before Lord CAMIPBELL.) EDWARDES V. S31TH. Mr. Sesjeaut Wells and Mr. Keane were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Dasent and Mr. MUetealfe appeared for the ef~endant. This was an action brought to recover 721. 6s. 4d., the balance of the plaintiff's claim, after Living credit for 401. against the defendant for v.ork and labour done, journeys undertaken, and money paid as an election agent in respect of the boroughs of Bedford and Bodmiu at the last general The defendant pleaded never indebted, and payment. MIr. Serjeant WELLS, in opening the case for the plaintiff, stated that the defendant was a gentleman who had acquired for himself considerable notoriety as the lessee of =rury-lane Theatre. He was also the owner of the Sundasy Times arnd Bedfordshuie Independent Papers, and a member of the Licensed Victuallers' Society. In addition to these occupations, by which he had accumulated a large fortune, he was desirous of attaining to the dignity of legislation, and at the last general election it was very well known that he was ambitious of the honour of a seat in the House of Commons. He accordingly went down to Bridport, and while there engaged in the canvass of that borougb, the plaintiff, who had considerable experience as an election agent, placed himself in communication with him by letter. The consequence of the corre- aondence which ensuei. was the retainer of the plaintiff br t e defendant as his sole agent at Bedford, and the plain. tiff having procured a requisition from the Radical interest of that borough Mr. Smith consented to stand, and despatched the plaintiff to the borough, where he remained for 12 days, engaged in conducting the canvass and contest on behalf of the defendant. Although the result was a defeat, yet the position occupied by the defendant on the poll showed that great exertions had been made by the plaintiff, for through his instrumentality the defendant was not only supported by some 40 Radicals, but also by about 150 of the Tory party, who strained every effort to defeat Mr. Whitbread and Mr. Barnard, the Whig candidates and present inembers, even though they might not succeed in bringing in Captain Stuart, their own candidate. The learned serjeaut, in the course of an exceedingly humourous speech, read to the jury several huge yellow placards, advocating the claims of Air. Smith to the suffrages of the constituency in highly eulogistic, not to say bombastic terms, which he put forward as the composition of his client, and then proceeded to caU the following witnesses in support of his case:- Nathaniel Forester Edwardes.-Ireside at Peckhamn. Iwas formerly a solicitor. Ihave had considerable experience as an election agent. I know the defendant and recolleet the 5th of Mlarch. I received a letter from him in reply to one Ihad addressed to him. The purport of my letter was, that having heard defendant was anxious for a seat in Parliament I wished to inform him that I was in a position to effect'it. 'Up to that time I knew very little of the defendant personaUy. The answer was to tho following effect:-"Dear Sir,-You wil obligo me by caling at Drury-lane Theatre in the evening. This letter will insure you an cntrec either before or behind the curtain." In consequence of that letter I went to the theatre the following day. I did not seethe defendant then. I caDed several times, and then found that he was at Bridport. I afterwards received a letter from defendant, requesting me to caU upon Alr. Lane. Accordingly I saw that gentleman on the 14th, and explained to him the prospects I considered he had at Bedford. Mr. Lane said he was very much sutrprised the defendant should enter into any such arrangement, considering the pledges he had made at Bridport. Mr. Lane proceeded to state that he considered Mr. Smith had no chance at Bridport; but still, having pledged hinmself there, he could not think he was justified in offering himself at Bedford. It was arranged that I should write to Mr. Smith by that night's post. I wrote to defenday ' On Sunday, the 15th, a messenger called upon me and a ted that a letterhad been written to me at Drury-lane, but chat by some mistake it had been put in the post on Saturday night, and could not reach metiUl Monday morning. The first letter informed me that he had met with an extraordinary reception at Bridport, but that he was a week behind. There were five candidates in the field, but he was not disposed to give up Lis cbance there unless I could afford him some prospect of success at Bedford. I know Mr. Bennett. He is the nianager of the Sunday Times. He called upon me the same day. He said he had received instructions from Mr. Smith to discuss with me the prospects of the Bedford election. We discussed the prospects and also my terms. I said I should require 50l. paid down inthe nature of aretainer. Ialso said I should require the exclusive professional management, and 1001. as a bonus in the event of success. Mr. Bennett said be had no authority from defendant to enter into a final arrangement, and as he would be in town tho following day I had better wait. I got another letter from defendant, stating that although he had received numerous promises at Bridport he confessed he would rather represent the constituency of Bedford. On Mosiday I saw defendant at the theatre, M-r. Bennett was present, I saw him in his private room. Defendant said he had talked the subject over with Mr. Bennett, and that he had authorized him to make certain arrangements, which I had better discoss with him. We retired into a private room. Mr. Bennett said he had diEcussed the matter with defendant; that the latter was not willing to give 501.. but would give 25. as a retainer, and that he would give me a further sum of 75. instead of 1001. in the event of success. I said, "There is another questionvwhich I must have settled,- I must have thoeexclusive professional agency.' Mr. hemnett.said "There could be no objection to that-is that all"' I said, "There is one other condition-Mir. Carpenter must not come down to the election." He is the editor of the Sunday Times. Mr. Beiinett said he was a gentleman of great talent. I said, "That may be so; butwe have had personal differences, and wo could not work together." br. Bennett said that was perfectly reasonable, and that it would be perfectly absurd to bring two inen who could not work together. I stated that in order that I might act efficiently, and have nio one to interfere with my exertions. Be seemed to fal in with my opinion, and said it would be also necessary that 1 should have some authority from the defendant to show to the electors that I vas bis agent. He said he would mention it to defendant. He then left me, but returned in a few minutes with a note from him. He also gave me 251. iu pursuance of the arrangement that had beenxmade between us. He said, `1i're's your money." Immediately after that defeidant caine out. He said, "Well, have you made it al right with Mr. Bennett ?" I said, "Yes everthing is settled; the terms are, that I should have 1. as a retainer, with the exclusive professional manarcnient of the election, without interference, and 7To. as a bonus if he (the defendant) should be returned." I vernt downi to Bedford the following morning, and proceeded at once to the Red Lion Hotel. I was a perfect stranger in Bedford at that time; but after a few xnlnuteg I was introdueed to some of the electors-Mr. John Bull, 3Sr. Henry Shelton, Mr. Charles Head, and sone -others of the Radical party. I stated that Mr. Sinimh was idlllng to become a candidate If he received such a requisition as vould give him promise of success. They Immediately fell Into my view, and a requisition was prepared, and the gentlemen took it out with them to obtain signatures. There was very little time to go round the town, and only about 20 signatures were obtained. On the following day Mezrs. Shelton, Bull, and Read accompanied me to London as a deputation. I telegraphed at Bletchley to tho effect that the gentlemen who were forminga deputation from the electors were on their way to London. 1 paid the fares of the deputation and some trifling expenses for refresbhments at the Red Lion. The gentlemen accompanied me to the theatre, and saw the defendant with me. The matters of the election were discussed, and the deputation explained vhy so few signatures were obtained-the opposition party bavng been canvassing with great determination had somewhat changed the state of affairs in the borough. I then left the deputation to discuss the matter with .the defendant. I afterwards had other conversation with the defendant, and said ho had better go down to Bed. ford himself, as the only chance of success against the Lii erals was to effect an arrangement with the Tory party. Defendant thereupon agreed to go down the next day. It was sgreed that Mr. Bull should go down first to announce that M1r. Smith would make his appearance. Mr. Shelton and myself were to folow, which arrangement was carried out. A meeting took place at the Eed Lion that evening, when Mr. Smith announced that I was his agent. lie stated that his arrangements at that moment would not justify him in giving a positive answer to the requisition, but it was very desirable to ask, the electors to withhold their promiEes for a few days. We agreed that it was better to publish a placard to that effect, and I wrote one ont immediately, which was printed in London, sent down to Bedford the folowing afternoon and circulated. When I saw the defendant again he asked me to go down to Bodmin, and I went to London for that prpose, but I did not go to Bodmin. I then returned to ord by direction of defendant, my object in doing so being to ascertain what prospect there was of effecting a coalition with the Tories. Accordingly I waited upon 3Mr. Eagles the agent for the Conservative party, and afterwards informedthe defendant whatarrangements I hadmade with that gentleman. Mr. Eagles observed very properly, in 'Which he (witness), fully concurred, that be did not agree with the coalition as being inconsistent with his character andposition. Isawhimalmost everydayafterthat. We bad no coalition, but we received very considerable support from the Tories. There was nothing binding upon the Tories as a party, but about 150 voted for the defendant in ccnsequence of my interview with the Tory agent. Most of the addresses, issued on behalf of defendant, -were written by me, and I sat up nearly the whole of one night preparing his address, and wrote to defendant to come down imme. diately, stating the satisfactory arrangement I had made with l. Eagles. That address was also printed inLondon. Previously to that I received a placard, announcing that the " Cat would be let out of the bag." I did not think that a satisfactory announcement to relieve the anxiety of the electors, and therefore I went to town myself. In the meantime the following letter crossed me on the road from the defendant, dated the 20th of March:- "My dear Edwardes,-I have the gout very bad. Telithe gentle. men IoDetobear fromthembyretur.

A meeting was accordingly called at 3 o'clock in the after. noon. nen I saw defendant in London I asked him for more money. He said he had sent 51. to me at Bedford and asked me how much more I wanted. I said I thought 10?. more might be sufficient. He gave me a check on his bankers, and I got it cashed at the Sunday Times office. The defendant arrived in Bedford about 6 o'clock the same evening. I had made arrangements for his arrivaL The bells were ringine, and the inhabitauts appeared to tas-e great interest m the new candidate. The defendant came down in his own carriage. Lord CA3IPBxri.-Did they take the horses out of his carriage and drag him into the town? Witness.-They did not degrade themselves to that extent, althongh it is often done at elections. (Laughter.) I prepared a circular letter for the electors in consequence of the shortness of time for the canvass. The defendant attended at a public meeting in the evening. In consequence of a report that an attempt would be made to pack the meeting I requested the chief constable to send the oice, to prevent any disturbance. Mr. Carpenter came own vwith the defendant, who attended the meeting and addressed the electors. On the AIonday before the election Mr. Pearse sent to know who was Mr. Smith's agent. I told the clerk I was, and would give an undertaking for the payment of the expenses. The nomination took place on iThursday, the show of hands being in favour of Captain Stuart and Mr. Smitb. The result of the election on Friday was quite the contrary. I stayed to the close of the election, and then returned to london. The defendant also returned the same evening. Iwas employed 1 dayson the Bedford election, and was up very late; on some occasions up all night-upon an average employed two-thirds of te ours. Iconsiderfiveguineasa.dayafairremuneration. Besides the retainer I paid various sums of money, and con. sider myself 201. out of pocket. I have applied repeatedly, but no notice whatever has been tiken of my letters. My solicitor, M1r. Morley, had an interview with Brandon, and, by my directions, stated to him that I[was unwilling to have recourse to legal proceedings, and would p refer a connpromise. Mr. Brandon recommended Mr. Smith to pay a certain amount. That gentleman refused, and then I commenced this action, hutnot till I had taken out a summons against the defendant in the Bankruptcy Court, which was Cross-examined by Ar. DA-smi.-I was in no employment at the time I wrote to Mr. Smith, but I had advertised my intention to undertake Parliamentary elections. I was looking out for business. I was not in any professional occupation at that time. Ivas in the employ of MIr. Brandon (the defendant's soliCtor) for 12 months as Chancery conveyancer and manager at a salary of 130L. a-year. I was formerly in practices having taken outmycertificate in 1834. I purchased a business, but it did not turn out profitable, and 1 gave it up. Since that time I have not practised as an attorney. I will swear that the 251. was not given me to defray the general expenses, or for the cost of obtaining the requisition only. I might have told the defendant that I could obtain 200 signatures, but that was before Mr. Barnard came out. Although a stranger in the town, I had information on which I thought r could rely. I did not go out canvassing; it was no part of my busi. ness to do so. The address and placards that I have named are my composition. The printers may have altered some few words, but the substance of them is mine. I did say to Mr. Carpenter that I thought the defendant was very distant, and appeared to think I was of no use to him and that I would pack up my things and go; but defendant would not allowv me. After the Bedford election I wrote to the defendant requesting an Interview of 10 minutes. I wanted him to give me a handsome letter to Lord Chelsea's committee, stating also that I wanted some money to enable me to make a propr appearance. I never received any reply to the half-dozen etters I sent to defendant. I dd not pay any bil at the man. E. Eagles, jun.-I am a solicitor, practising in Bedford. I have, in conjunction with my father, been engaged in Par. liamentary elections as a Conservative agent for many years. I conducted the election for Captain Stuart, the Tory candi. date. In the course of that election I met the plaintiff. I supposed he was Mr. Smith's agent. I received a communication from him. In conseqnence of that I met him. I daresay during the electionl had half-a-dozen intervievw with him. The object of Mr. Edwardes was to effect a coalition between Capt3ai Stuart and Mr. Smith. I believe I left plaintiff wit an impression that Captain Stuart's party vould not oppose Mr. Smith. That wv s the consequence of certain circumstances that took place on the part of the Conservative party. I did not consider myself responsible for party opinions. I saw Mr. Edwardes on several occasions, and be seemed to be zealous in the cause of Mr. Smith. About 150 Tories voted for the Radical candidate, but Captain Stnart was quite opposed to this. I received 701. for my agency. Five guineas a-day isa faircharge. John t. BulL-I recollect the plaintiff coming down to Bedford on the subject of the election. I accompanied him to town and saw the defendant. I also had an opportunity of seeing the conduct of the plaintiff. Se did nothina but smoke and drink lemonade. (Laughter.) I never made a different statement to anyone. Mr. Edwardes spoke to ne; but I was careful not to commit myself. Cross-examined.-Mr. Read and Mr. Shelton fetched me to attend at the Red Lion, and MIr. Edwards asked me to go with bins to London. We had a conversation about the election. I said there was no cbance nnless the Tories voted to a man. Be said you had better not say so to MIr. Smith or he won't come forward. I said that I should make , tlain statement to the defendantk as I would not have any lame thrown upon me. I did not have any conversation with the plaintiff afterwards, as I thought he was not to le_trusted. Be-examined.-I did not tell the defendant not to trust the plaintiff. I attended at Evans's singing-shop with the defendant, and also at the Cvder Cellas. We had something stronger than lemonade. Jo'hn YMantel.-I produce a copy of the London and country editions of the Sunclay Tim7es of the same dateone containing an address to the electors of Brid ort, solicitinig their suffrages; thie other an address to=Bdord, and sn article on ihbe Bedford Charity. 1 was an active suppoxter of Whitbread and Barnard. I had an opportunity cfseeiing Mr. Edwardes on his firt arrval, and on severnd occasions subsequently. He appeared to be very active in the cause of the defendant.. Cross-examnined by M1r. MxTcaLr.-I was invited to attend the committee of Mr. Smith. The plaintiff inquired, an,d v,eryproperly, whowere thereal Radtcals. Therowere two classes of Radicals in Bedford-the one would sell themselves to any per-son ; but the othier stuck- to their principles. Plaintiff spoke to mae s a real RadicaL I at. tended three or four committee meeting though I was an active supporter of Whitbread and Barnard at the same time. That's a fact, and no mistake. They sought me. I did not seek them. The agent askea the chambearmat v~bo was the most intelligent and influential man in the Radical interest, and she saild I was. (Great laughter.)

MTIhAND CIROMIT. LPTOEs.RTF.R .TT.v 17 CROWN CO7JRT.-(Beforc MUr. Juestice Csswza.) Elizabeth Hiokson, who was convicted yesterday of apoetoffice robbery at Melton Mowbray, was sentenced this morniDg to four years' penal servitade. Elizabeth Smith, aged 16, was placed at the bar upon a charge of cauing her mistress to take a certain noxious thing-to wit, nitrate of meroury, with intent to do her rievous bodily harm. There was another count in the iixn dictment, chargingher with admiuistering poison with intent to murder, btut the grand jury had igpored that uoart of the indictment, and abe was consequently put upon her tza on the other count oily. MIr. BALGUY conducted the case for the prosecution, and from his statement it appeared that the prisoner, on the 23d of April lht, was in the service of Mlr. Greaves, a farmer at Castle Donington, and that her mistress, Mrs. Greaves, having been unwell1 for a day or two, had prepared for her. self some chamomile tea, hich she took occasionally. On tbe day in question, being still unwell,'she resorted to her usual remedy, but, upon drinking some of it, she discovered very nauseous in the taste, and experienced a burning sensation in herthroat aDd stomach. Rapidly she became very ill, was in greatpain, and vomited violently. Being satisfied that something had been put into the tea, she gave Iorders that what remained in the teapot should be preserved - but in defiance of those orders the prisoner took it up and emptied its contents down a drain. The prisoner also threw away the remaining contents of a bottle, which was in the house, labcelled poison, and 'ich contained a preparation of mercury, purchased by Mr. Greaves for the cure of rot in the feet or bis sheep. Ai surgeon was immediately called in to attend Mr.Greaves, and he succeeded in recovering her by administering the antidote for mercury; but he stated that she had taken as much as wvould have killed her if it had not made her violently sick. The prisoner on bei-g questioned on the subject admitted that she bad poured the stuff out of the bottleinto thechamomile tea, and that she knew it was poison; but she said that she did not intend to kill her mistress, but only to make her sick, as ehe did not think she bad put enough of it in to kill her. Her only motive for this conduct Fwas that her .istress had reproved her the night before fer having lingered on an errand when she had been desired to make The learned J73DGX, after bearing the openingsetatement1 exuressed his opinion that the evidence would not sustain the indictment, which was framed upon anAct of Parliament directed against an entirely different class of offences. It -was the statuto 9th and 10th Victoria, cap. 25, sect. 4, vwhereby it was enacted that "w vhoever shal unlawfully and maliciously cause any gunpowder or other explosive substance to explode, or Eend, or deliver to, or cause tobo taken or received by any person any explosive substance, or any other dangerous or noxious thing, or cast or throw at or upon, or otherwlse apply to any person any corrosive fluid, or other destructive or explosive substance, with intent in any of the cases aforesaid, to burn, maim, disfigure, or disable any person, shall, although no bh y injury be effected, be guilty of felony." NTow, although the words " cause to 'be taken any noxious thine" were found In that section, yet, looking at the whole context, he was clearly of opinion that they did not apply to the taking of poison internally, but only to the taking in hand or receivmg of dangerous substances calculated to do external bodily injury; and Mr. Justice Erle, whom he had consulted on that point, entirely concurred with him. A verdict of Not Guilty was consequently taken, and the prisoner discharged.

NORTHERN CIRCUIT. YORK- .Tm.v in THE CIVIL COUIT.-(BefOre I. i Baron WATSON and Speciwl Juries.) s BARUGH V. TOPHAM. This case was commenced yesterday and adjourned. The action vas btought for negligence against the defendant as an attorney in taking and preparing an insufficient security for mnoney lent by the plaintifi Mr. HiU. C., Mr. Atherton, Q.C., and Mr. Manisty, Q.C., appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Temple, QO., and Mr. Jones, for the defendant. It appeared that in March, 1856, a person named Peter P. Buck was indebted in a sium of 1,0001. to Mr. Topham, a brother of the defendant; and being pressed for payment he had given a biR of sale of the whole of his property. Buck was also indebted to other parties, and on the lab of May, 1856, an oxecution was put into his house, and thereupon MIr. Topham took possession under his bin of sale, and was about to. sell the property. The plaintiff was a creditor of Buck to the extent of about 7001., and Buck and his brother applied to the plaintiff to pay out the bil of sale and take another biUl of sale of the property as his security. Though ostensibly only a famer and not subject to the bankrupt[laws, itturned out thatBuck was reaUy all thistime carrying on a smlaU trade in cattle and corn. The plaintiff having consented t pay out the bil of sale, went to the defendant's office and there saw his clerk, Mr. House and informed him of his intention to advance the monev and take the bill of sale as his security and-to employ Mr. Allison of D)arhatna his attorney to prepare the deed. M1r. House then sidtt he could do itas well audas cheaply, and that ho woud ake it fast and secare against everything, bankruptcy amnaonthe rest. It appeared that Mir. House was asked in Buck's presence if he could be made a bankrupt, and that Mfr. House said "No, a farimer cannot be jade a banlrupt," and Buck hearing this did not say a word to indicate that he was a trader subject to the bankruptcy laws, as well as afarmer. The mosey was advanced and the bill of sale executed, and Buck was immediately mnade a bankrupt. At the close of yesterday his Lordship intimated that thls was a case which ought to be settled as the case then stood, as there would be somie difficulty in making out the retainer to include more than the making of a secure deed. This morning the learned counsel on either side having consulted with his Lordship on a point agreed to be left to his deelsion, a verdict was agreed to be entered for the defendant, his Lordship saying no imputation whatever rested on Mr. Topham. rTOnRNTT, EXECUTIX OF THOMIAS BATESON, V.

The return train in the eveninig was due at the Settle station from Skipton at 7.40, and the deceased and Mris. Halstead arrived at the station about three minutes before it was due, and seated themselves on the platform. After waiting some time Mrs. Halstead went into the ladies' waiting-room, and in going looked into one of the offices of the company, where she saw all the three officers who attend to the station together.- She asked if the train was not behind its time,'nd alwas told it was 10 minutes behind. She remained a littlb time in the waiting-room, and then heard a cry, "Thetrain is coming." he immediately went out to where Mr. Bateson was standing, and just at that time she heard one of the officers of the company say in a hurried manner, "Across for Lancaster." Bhe and Air. Bateson proceeded to cross, She had nearly got across, when she turned round and caught a glance of Mr. Bateson apparently struggling with his scarf, and the train just upon the point of coming upon him. Immediately afterwards he was knocked down and run over, and, on being taken to Lancaster, died that night of the injuries he had received. Mrs. Halstead was lso knocked down in her attempt to get on the platform, was bruised and much frightened, and suffered a miscarriage in consequence. The facts having been proved, The learned Co-uxsxr, after a short consultation, agreed to a verdict for the plaintiff for 1. 0001.

THE XCMMO .Ai LONDOrq LUZ ASSURANCZ AND LO"N ASSOCIATION V. PICKLES This was an action for slander, In saying that the plain. tifi, in their trade of life asurers, were at best a set of scamps and scoundrels, and thae the ComPany was anything but safe. The defendant pleaded "Not Guilty." g Mfr. Atherton, Q.C., and Mfr. Wheeler were for the plaintiffsi Mr. Overend, Q.C., and Mr. Blanshard for the defendan'. The plaintifVfs company, it a ppeared, was formed under a deed of settlement in 1853, andlt was a joint-stockcompany coa Iletely reistered. They had their chief office at Maln. chester, and also a branch offee at Leeds. The defendant Is the agent of a similar association at Leeds, called the British Protector Life Assurance Company, and the action was brought for the purpose of recovering damages from the de. fendant forthe expressions he had used regarding the plain. tll company. The agent of the plaintiffs at Leeds is Mr. John Hill, and he heard that the defendant had been din. a ng the reputation of the company. In the montlh of July last year Mr. Stanton, provision dealer, of Leeds, effected a policy with the plaintifie company for 5001. on his own life. For some reason or other he afterwards handed the policy over to a friend, and In harch last, in consequence of hearing that the defendant had been showing his policy to various persons, he wrote a letter to him en the subjct. The defendant called npon Mr. Stanton, who, wishing that the policy might be delivered up to him, made a request to that effect, During that interview the defendant said, "I am pre. pared to prove that the 3anchester ndLondonlife As. surance and Loan Assocation are nothing else than a set of rogues and vagabonds." In Febraary last Mr. Asquith, butcher, of Lee a ed to the plaintifor a polioy on his life and on that of lIswife for 201l., and on the defendant being told that he (Mr. Asquith) had Insured with the plain. tiffs he said, " I am very sorry to hear it, for they are nothing else but a set of scamps and scoundrels." He, in the course of the same conversation, told Mr. Asquith that the plaintiffs' company was anything but safe. It was under these circumatances that the present action was brought; and the learned counsel for the plaintiffs con. tended that ample damages ought to be given to the plaintiffs. The learned counsel for the defendant admitted that the words were uttered by him, but without any malice on his art and under circumstances of considerable extenuation, 9either he nor his client said that the plaintiffs were a dis. honest company, and they were not there to offer a justifica. tion. He also submitted that they had snffered no damage from what the defendant had said, the latter having acted bondj?d4, and not as a common slanderer, and the plaintiffs had suffered no damage whatever. M1r. Baron CAN=, in summing up, said; the only question for the Jury was what amount of damaes they would award to the plaintiffs, who were clearly entitled to a ver. diet. He did not think there was any actual damage proved by the utteranceof these words. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs-Damages, lil. DAVIS V. PREST. Mr. Atherton, Q.C., and Mr. Addison were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Manisty, QC., the Hon. Mr. Liddell, and Mr. Simpson for the defendant. The plaintiff, it appeared, is the widow of Mr. Thomas Davis, who was an auctioneer at Halifax, and the action had been brought on the ground of certain false representations which were alleged to have been made to induce her to hecome the tenant of the Griffin Inn, in that town. These re. presentations were made by the defendant's son-in-law, John Prest, jnn,, but the defendant admitted that he was respon. sible for them. In January last the house was occupied by John Prest, jun., and in that month he represented to Mrs. Davls that the regular receipts were 241. a-week, and that the house had a good connexion. The plaintiff took the house, and agreed to give 801. for the goodwill, but the ave. rage receipts per week since she became the tenant had been somethbing less than 7X, and that, as it was stated, from no fault on her part in the management of the house. It was proved by the plaintiffthat some time before the house was transferred to the plaintiffits business had been falling off, and the defendant, in order to get custom among a certain class, had hired as a waiter aman from Rugeley who had, It was said, acted as the executioner of Palmer tho murderer. This was publicly made known, and speoal trains crowded with passengers came from Rochdale to see this man, and receive their beer at his hands at the Griffin Inn. This "chawbacon," as he was desecrbed, waited on the customers in a smookfrock; but so far from restoring the custom of the house, the proceeding after the first novelty was over a peared to disgust and drive away the regular customers. witnesses wre called for the defence, and the case having been adjourned occupied till midday next His LOxnSma having summed up the evidence, Thae jurydreteifred,and afteranabsnce of two hours CIVm COVrT,-(Before Mr. Baron WATsoiN ancZ Specicl Jurpy.) THE QUEE V. JOWEIT. Mr. Bliss, Q.C., Mr. Pickering, Q.C., anad M. Cleasby were counsel for the Crown - Mr. Hill, Q.C., Mr. Overend, Q.C., Mr. aIamerten, and ifr. Cross for the defendant, This was an indictment for a. nuisance in stopping up public footway. The prosecutors were in reality the Cor poration of Bradford, and the indictment was brought by them against the defendant to try the right of the public to a footpath which crosses some of his landed estate at Mauningham, near Bradford. The defendant is the owner of a farm called the " Waterside farm," situate on the west side of the above-named town, and near the Thornton-rosad. Across this farm there is a footpath which, it was aeged, the public had enjoyed the right to frequent for a long series of years. The defendant, how. ever, was opposed to the continuance of this path, and had caused a stile to be built up, a shed to be erected on the path where it runs across the foldyard of the farm, and a notice-board to be placed with the words I-To Road" painted on it. The public were warned against trespassing, and it was said that a dog was Introduced into the foldyard in order to frighten them. Persons stil continued to use the path, and disputes arose from time to time, until at length the Corporation of Bradford, who are the surveyors of the highways, took the matter In band, and instituted the pre. sent proceedings in order to try the question. A number of aged witnesses were called on the part of the prosecution to prove the existence of the footpath for many years, on e of whom was 89 years of age, who had known the public use the path 82 years ago. Mr. Hsr=, for the defendant, said, that it was a singular circumstance that, since the year 1838, when these obstructions were caused, the inhabitants of the neighbourhood had been slumbering. He contended that the path was only a private one leading to the Waterside fatm and three cottages which formerly were in existence close to the farm. If the tenants had over and over again allowed persons to cross the fields, that did not prove the path was a public one, unless there had been a dedication of it by the owner of the soiL He then called witnesses to prove that they had been turned back when they had entered the fields, and that there was no right of road in that direction. Mr. BuLss replied, submitting tbat, as the footpath had existed from time immemorial, the public had a preserip. tive right of way, and subsequent interruption by the defendant was altogetlher nugatory. His LoRDsHIP then summred up, observing that it was undoubtedly a strong fact in the case that the footpath had been closed for the last 19 years; but while they had evi. dence of an uninterrupted use from time immemorial, they had, on the other hand, a number of witnesses who proved interruption during 60 years, and one interruption was worth 100 users. The jury found a verdict, the effect of which will be to open the footpath again to the public. SATURDAY, JULY 18. (Before Mr. Barroan WTsox.) MDDLETON V. WHEATCROFT. This was an action for seduction. Mr. Hill, Q.C., and Mr. Jones appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Overend, Q.C., for the defendant. The plaintiff it appeared is a widow, having three daugh. ters, of whom the subject of the present action was the youngest, and 20 years of age. The two elder supported themselves as milliners, and the youngest, after being educated at St. Phillips School, Sheffield, became a teacher in the school at a say of 201. a-year. The defendant is a butcher and baker, residing opposite the plaintiff's, and at the winter fair of last year he became acquainted with the plaintiff's daughter, and after visiting her for some time proposed marriage to her, and was accepted. The result of their intimacy was the birth of a child in November last. The defendant's attentions had long cooled, and he refused to perform his pro. mise. In consequence the child had been affiliated to him, and the present action had been brought. The young woman had lost her situation of teacher at the school and her mother had had 31. 13s. 6d. to pay to her doctor, and now had her daughter on her hands in deliate health to maintain. The young woman was called as a witness, and cried very bitterly in giving her evidence. The learsed counsel for the defence would not attempt to excuso his client, and expressed his sorrow forthe young woman, but ho begged the iury in their estbnat9 of theb da- inages not to taike nto consideration the breach of promise of marriag to the young woman, for which another acffonI wvould be bronght against his client, who would thus ho subjected to the hardship of being made to pay twiice Ior the same error. His LIOP.SnIP In summing up sid, It was by no means certain that there would be another action, as that would depend upon whether the plaintiff could prove the promlee of marriage by other evidence, as she could not be her own witness; and, as to tho hardship, the defendant should not have acted in the manner he hsd done, and he would not thenhave had to complain of anyhardship. The jury' after a short consultation, found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 120/. lEAT V. BROWNV. This was an action for slander of the plantiff in his business. - Mr. Temple, QC., and 3Mr. Remplay appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. %11, Q.C., and Mr. Jones for the dezendant. The plaintiff it appeared Is a cloth manufacturer I a small way of business at Yeadon, and the defendant is aiso a cloth mannfacturer, but on a much larger scale at tho esIe place. Some time ago the plaintiff began to mmufao. ture a description of cloth caLed "unions," the warp of wbich is of cotton, the weft of wool, which before that time the defendant only had manufactured. Soon after this the plintiff began to find that that credit whichhehad heretofore enjoyed in carrying on his business ceased, and unless he paid cash for what he ordered goods were not delivered to him. At leugth, in conversation with a person named Brook, with whom he had long deat, he learnt that the defendant had said to Brook concerning him, that he was a bad payer, and that if he (Brook) gave himneredit he would never be paid. The plaintiff in consequence saw the defendant, and asked him what he meant,and the defendant then,iii the presence of athird person, said, "It's my opinion thou wiontt pay OWt; thou!s nowt but a d-d rogue."

LonD HAsTIGS .qD TnE N sPAlPj PBESS.- In the latter part of last year a dispute occurred at Holt, Norfolk, 'with regard to the conLviction of certan labourers by the local magistrates for taking rabbits froin a commorn near the town. The Norfolk News commented rather sharply on the conduct of the magistrates, of whom Lord Hastings was one, and on the day the first article appeared on the subject his lordship proceedea to theresdence of the editor, Mr. 3.

A day or two sione, however, Lieutenant-Colonel Astley had ainmtervewwith Mr. TUietton the part of Lord Hastinags,and the following.

SEH "LATE Housst Aprtt from the gravity of the subject under discusdon, there was someting irresstibly droll in the manner in which the debate on Lord John lussell's new proposition to admit the Jews was conducted on Saturday morning. For at lest the lat threo-quarters of an hour It was reaUy "as 3ood as a play," and wi tot readily be forgotten by any nepresent. Commenig somewhereabout2oclockinthe Inorning, after the House had been exhausted bya sitting of i 12 hours duration, itwas eontlnmued until hlf-past 4, when the sun W far above tho horizon. There were some 150 mrmbes present, about equally divided on both sides of the House, but they. gradualy dropped off, though the Last, f he zmany diviions which took place showled that at a quarter-past 4 o'clock upwA* of 130 still remained. Most of the great ParamentUy chefa, however, had retired from the sene, and tho angry debate which ensudo was chiefly confined to younger andless experenced Zen. A. few 11eepy-looking "strangera" lingered in the part of the House devoted to that class of the community and several seat in the reporteragallery were for some timne uspldoulryvacant. One of our contemporaries, by tho way, in its hot hasto to ruh Into print on Saturday morn. Ing, stated, s an excuse for not continuing its report of the debate to the conclusion, that at half-past 4, when it went to press, the Hous ws still sitting, though in point of fact it had then rsen, rhile another characteristically enough Ignored the dission on the Jew Bill altogether. For some years put there has rarely been so great an amount of pary and personal feeling introduced into a debate in either Houwe. Even Mr. Eoebuck1 who on avery recent ocsion asked theHouse If it was to be "Cntenutto dwe in decense for yer," appoes to have been alarmed at the license which some who took part in the dIscuion allowed themselves, for he very proPerly appesled. to the Speaker at one timo to know if the term "bully," ued by one bon. member who took a con. tPicuouspartin the debte, -was Parliamentary language. The member for Mldhurst, also, while speakng on one of the motions for adjournment, called the attention of the Hlouse to the light of the summer morning which reproached them, and in the same breath aia he would remain for 24 hours longer rather than agree to the Introdaction of the Bill. He concluded with some platitude about "the people of England," which called up Mr. Locke, the new member for Southwark, who reminded ithe Opposition thatb he Â£at for A contituency some 10,000 in number, who felt strongly in favour of the admission of the Jews, and, late as the hour wa, he would stayin hIs place as long as Mr. Warren to support the motion bofore the House. Then there was an amusing little pasge of arms between Mr. MI'Cann, the member for Drogheda, and, we think, Mr. Newdegate, but this only lasted for a minute or two. It was followed by Colonel Knox jumping up in his place on the Opposition side, and with great warmth and manner twitting Lord Bury with his Canadian poliEcs and his ultra-democratic sentimentsasflected Inthenoblelordls county newspaper, and charging him with taldnga'very conspicuous part inthe uproar which proceeded from tho Ministerial side. This ave rse to a storm of disapprobation, which grow louder when the colonel said something about the noble lord's conduct that night being worthy "the pothouse meeting over the way," alluding to the gathering at the King's Arms, In Palace-yard, on the Jew question on Thursday. Lord Bury denied that a Norfolk newspaper was any index of his politics, or that bis conduct that evening had justified the remarks of Colonel Knox Again, for there was no end of such incidents, Lord Galway, at nearly half-past 4 in the morning, took advantage of a motion for the adjournment of the House to revive a quarrel which had been settled in the early part of the sitting as to the adjournrent of the Bath Election Committee on Thursday, and corplained of Mr. Roebuck basing spoken of him in Impertinent terms. The Speaker thereupon interposed, and Lord Galway said he would withdraw the offensive expression, and say that Mr. Roebuck haA used language on thatoccasLion which was "I ot pertinent." This ingenious manner of avoiding a difficulty restored the good humour of the House, but Lord Galway was less successful when he attempted a minute after to support his motion for adjourn. ment by teluig the House that they had then entered on the Jewish Sabbath, which eliclted a roar of derisive laughter. Eventually Lord John Russell, who had looked calmly onforsome tnmefrombis sat on a back bench on the Ministerial side, after maling a significant remark as to the temper of the House, withdrew the bone of contention, and the wrangle was brought to an end.

yZLoJy FEEMR IN rX WXSTr INDXA 8TEAMEBS TO THE EDITOR OF THE TamS. Bir,-Permit me very briefly to call the atiention of tho' directors of the Royal Mail Steam Company to the alarming morhlity aridng from yellow fever on boari almos the wholo of their vessels I hal simply tate tie facts which came under my own experienco as a pssernger and chaplain on board the Orlnoco. The vessel, which left eingaton, Jamaica, conve.ing goods and passengers to St. Thomesj was the Clyde. Itis impopsible to speak too highly of the order and cleamlimesg of the ship and the gentlemanly attention of the offioere. During a passge of four days there died, I think, eight men, while there was on board, however, when we left her. a great number sick, and dangerously so. When transhippeff into tho Orinooo at St. Thomas, it was hoped that we had left thepedilene bend. Quitethe contray; for, without going into tho distresing details of each days mortality, it may be stated that, out of 75 cases attacked, 28 died of the yellow fever-one of whom, by the way, died within a few hour sail of Southampton. ThisIs more than one man out of three, or, to spread the 2nmnber of deaths over the time of the voyage, it would be about two daily. This in a very alarming state of matters, more particularly when one taken into account thit all these cases were young, vigorous mena allsomewhereaboutthe ap of 20. Were this a mere iiolated case it would be quite lem. proper and, perhaps, unfair to bring it publicly forward. It may therefore, withaout contradiction, be stated that the condition of those vesses is a fair type of that of all the company's steamers either within or comirg within the tropics, not only this year, but every year.. The last accounts I beard of tho Dee were that she too had Lost le men In a short tiff, from the sme cause This is truly alarming; more especially as any onewho has lived for any length of time within the tropics know that the months when yellow fevor most prevails are yet16 come, and, as a consequence, will feel convinced that this disease has not even yet assumed itg worst virulence. The question naturally arlses, what is to be done, or what can be done, on the part of the directors to prevent, or at least mitigate, this sad state of things. It would be presumptuous, perhaps, for me to offer any suggestions of a remedial nature. As I have hithertoconflned myself totht statement of facts, I shall do so in reference to preventive or remedial means. Every one knows that St. Thoma's in the great central coaling dep8t of the company's vessels; and every one, at least within the tropics, knows that not one of the company's vessels which has coaled there but hag been attacked with the disease, and also that every vessel that has not gone In there Is stil free from It. The con. clusion that is forced on any one is that this dep6t is tlhe foss a oigo malrum. If so,it wllbe manifest that, during the present emergency at least, it would bo advisable to mako some arrangement whereby the steamers should not approach the coal wharf, but that, lying at some distance out of the harbour, the coals should be conveyed by lighters and the lbour done by nativo labourers. This is quite practicable, and, considering the absolute certainty of the losg of human life if some preventive means be not adopted, it becomnes terribly Imperative. Thero Is another conclusion forced on any one from his experience, and which, when stated, commueds itself to the soundgoodsenseofallwhowM calmlyconsder; itthat is, the establishmentof a hospital either in St Thomas's, or on board a ship at some distanco from the harbour. The necessityot this is twofold. First, for the sake of the pasengers. When, on board of the Orinoco, It first became generally under. stood that we caried away so many sick snd dying in the fever, and that we thus carrled a hospital with us, there wore very great alarm and uneasiness. So much was thi the case that several left their cabins and slept about ort sofas and on the deck, rather than sleep in the immediate neighbourhood of the pesilenoe which" walketh in dark. ness." I cannot tell you the gloom which pervaded the passengors generally, as each day brought the accounts of itg mortality, or how stronglymen felt when they reflected that those who were sick in St. Thomas's should have been left behind in a hospital. In the next place, I plead for theestablishment of such a hospital, owned and conducted by the company, for the sake of the sick men themselves I feel thatI am advancing to very deUcate ground, but it must be* atedthat, consideringthe nature of yellow fever,more esped.- allytheconstantattentionnoessryat that critcaltimewhen. the patient is just beginning to recover, and when the danger is that he wiU sink if not most carefully m3nistered to, it is. impossible that one rman could do the dtutles of surgeon and' nurse at the Same time. I speak in the highest terms of the captain and tho fine young fellow vho was surgeon on. hoard the Orinoco; and, while Itestify to the attention, theskill, and the energy of the latter, I feel, notwithstanding all this, thatthe chancesof recoverywouldhave beenfargreaterhad the men been where they could have obtained, in addi. tion to the skill of tho doctor, the attention of the nuxsc. It is very sad to soe fine fellows, amid the constant noise and bustle and confinement of the ship, gasping in the agonies and sinuking under the exhausion of this malignant disease. if St. Thomas's bo sll retained as the dep5t, everL with the certain prospect of a frightful aunual mortality, by all means, for the sake of the passengers, and for the sakes of the sick, let the company establish a hospital there. Whatever is to be done-and something must be doneought to be done at once as the months of August, September, and October aro the months when this fever puts forth. its chief strength. In conclusion, I supposoaI need not say that I can have no motive in writing this hurried letter but the cause of humanity. From my peculiar position I had ample oppor. tunities of witnessing the many scenes in connexion witl. this sad visitation. I am not charging blame or negligence on any one; but I feel that, perhaps, the directors, away at the distance, are not really aware of the state of matters on boardtheir ships. Iknow it is ey to peruse a formallist. of deaths, and in the hurry and bustle of pressing thingeto receive no great impression or alarm from such a cata logne of names. Let any one, however, personally witnesg dozing one voyage the alarm which haunts those who are unattacked as each day brings its tidings of menn eizedand of others dead; let him go through the hospital wherethis fright. ful disease inall its shapes and stages is fearfully visible; let him bo present for a number of successire days, when on each evening there will be consigned two or three bodies to the deep, and bodies, too, of the strongest and most activeo men in the ship; lethim listen tothe dreadful lamentationL which rises in the streets of Southampton when widows and mothers and children learn the terrible fate of those whom they come to welcome, but whom they will never see -more; and let al this be multiplied by the number ol vessels engaged in tho service, and I feel it would be impossible to suppress the resolution of doing what one can to remedy this state of things, and save from such sudden and terrible fate any more victims. I believe everbody knows that mucho an be done to remedy this, and therefore, in the name and for the sake of those who are still exposed to the danger, do I call upon those with whom lies the remedy to act, and act immediately. Human life is too precious a thing ts be trifled with. I remain, Sir, Yours. J. RADCORFE. Allinster of the Church of Scotland, Kingston, 3amaica, and Chaplain for the voyage on board the Oxinoco. Sonthampton, July 16. TO THE EDITOR OF TE11 TIEES. Sir,-I observe that attention is directed by two correspondents in your impression of to-day to the sanitary condition of the island of St. Thomas and the ships of the Royal West India Mail Company. It Is, unfortunately, too notorious, not only that St.' Thomas's is a very hot and nnhealthy island, but that the coaling station and slip of the Mail Company are, beyona all comparison, the most unhealthy parts of it. It appears that the company have now deoided on removing to their old coaling station, and so far there is an improvement; but there can be no doubt that the danoer from the slip will still remain, and that the island has been badly releeted, having been chosen on account of its geographical position and tolerable harbour, without sanitary considerations haviog had due weight. This is the real state of the case, but it must also be borne in mind that the habits of sailors in the West Indies, and especially of the stokers and others employed in the engine-room, are eminently ill adapted to preserve health. That the unhealthiness of occupation, combined with the habit of eating unripe and rotten fruit and drinking rum, is the chief cause of mortality must be evident to every one, as it Is well known that passengers Are rarely sufferers. I have myself gone on board a ship at St. Thomas's which had just lost nearly half her crew in the course of a fort. night while on the slip in that island, although duoing the time occupied in reaching Hiavannah neither I nor any pas. senger suffered in the smallest degree. Threo times, also, I have been on board steamers when deaths from yellow fever have occurred, and in no case has the disease spread among Passengers. Iremain, &c, * V. T. ANSiTFDT 17, anchester-street, July 18. TO THE EDITOR OF THsE TIMS. Sir,-On reading a letter in 7we Tirnps of to.day I was forcibly struck by the accurato knowledge evinced by " A Wesb Indian Traveller" of the true source of that fatal diseaso, tho yellow fever, among the unfortnate crews of the Royal Mail steamers at the D)anish islald of St. Thoraas, and also at the excellent suggestions made by him as to the alterations required in the present system of coaling at that place.

Three medical officers will be attached to each battalion. Colonel Holloway.comsnanded the marinobattalion in the expedition to 9Â£ertch. A new system of training navil cadets is about to come into oporatior, afloat, in pureuance-of the provisions of an Admiralty circular dated the 2Sd of Februnary last, The 3lustrious, 72, Captain Robort Rarris, is being titted with mcoramodation by the dookyard *,rtificars at Portsmouth for the first instalment of naval cadets who received nominations on the 1st of May to paws on the 5th of August. The llUstrious is, wo believe, to be stationed off Block. house, near the Gosport ehoie, which affords room alike for nautical observations and tquatic exercises. The appointmnent of the Rev. I. M. Inskip. chaplain and naval instruc. tor on board Her Majesty's ship Victory to be chaplain aind, first naval instructor to the Cadets has been made. The cadets are to remain in the flitstrious different periods, proportioned to their ages, those of 13 remaining 12 months, and those verging upon 15 only six months. Their course of study comprises Euclid, algebra, naut cal astronomy, French, and drawing, and their practical ,urse (which Is the primary object of the placing them in a training ship before sending them on sea service) will consist of Instruction in rigging ships, managing boats, and the general principles of ma--suvring sips at sea, thus furnishing the ground work on which their future professional knowledge is to be based. The cadets thus placedin the Illustrious may stil be considered under probation, as the circular expresses that should they be required to pass the required examination out of the trainng ship, or should they seriously misconduct themselves or show unfitness for the navy, the Admiralty have reservedto themselves the right todisoharge them. The cadets will be allowed to count only three mionths' time for the training-ship, and will be permitted to pass for lieutenant after five years' service, including the three months, provided they have passed the intermediate sexaminations, which have been judiciously arranged to insure a steady progression both in science and seamanship. Cap. tain Harris has long been engaged in training the " novices" for the fleet. The Calabar freightship sailed from Portsmouth on Saturday afternoon with the third portion of the 88th for India, as fully reported before. The Sparrowhawk, 4, steam gun-vessel, was commissioned at Portsmouth on Saturday by Commander J. C. Byng for foreign serviee. The Roebuck and Assurance, sister vessels, were also commissioned on Saturday by Commanders Marten and Aynsley. TheRoyal Artillery Regiment was on Saturday morning pa. raded in front of Head-quarters, Woolwich, and was formed into column, for the purpose of witnessing the distribution of theSardinianmedals. ColonelBloomfield, aide-de-campto the Queen, doing duty as commandant of the garrison, attended by his staff, arrived on the parade ground at 9 o'clock, and having inspected the column addressed himself to the offilcers and men about to receive the decoration, remarking at some length on the importance of this distinction conferred by the King of Sardinia to mark his estimation of their valour in the Crimea. He had been delegated, he said, by Her Majesty to distribute the medals with every formality which might tend to impress uponthem the value of the decoration as well as to stimulate their comrades in the exertion to obtain a similar reward. The gallant eolonel then handed the medals in the following order-to AMajor-General John Edward Dapuis, C.B., Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Thomas, Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Bruce Hamley, Brevet Lieu. tenant-Colonel J.

The entire number appointed to receive the decoration amounts to 1 genera], 7 Colonels, 19 majors, 7 lieutenants, twvo surgeons, and 15 non-commissioned officers and gunners of the Royal Atillery, the remainder of whom ate on home or foreign stations, and to whom the medals are to be for. warded. The freightship Regina sailed from Woolwich on Satarday, laden with military stores and ammunition for Cape ToWn. The military store department at Woolwich have commenced despatebiug greased cartridges (marked, " For the European troops") for embarcation on board the freightships Monarch and Blenheim, at Gravesend, destined for India; and also five other ships, leading in the Londondocks, for the same destination, in the service of the East India Company, The freighthip Spartan, in tho London-docks, is being laden with Ordnance stores from Woolwchb, for Hongkong, and the John Brie, for the Cape of Good H'ope.

AFRicAN EmsGRATIONN.-The following particulars respecting the Kroomen were read by Lord Malmesbury in his speech on this subjeet last Friday. They wero furnished by Sir Henry Huntley, who was for seven years Governor at the Gambia, and long commanded cruisers on the African coast :-" The Kroomen come ia smaU canoes from their country (500 miles) to Sierra Leone In search of labour. They are employed up the River Sierra Lsone, Alellacoree, and other rivers, by the merchants to out and prepare timber for shipping to England. They enter also on board merchant ships trading along the coast, aud also those trading in the rivers for paln oiL They freguently assist in navigating vessels whichl have lost men by lever, &c., to England. I know an instance of 30 going to England in a leaky vessel to help at the pumps. At Fernando Po upwards of 350 were employed by an English company to cut timber-very fine teak wood-stipulating to be sent home every third year; their wages varied from 3d. to 10d. per diem. They receive pay in merchandise. Ships of war always have Kroonien on board on the coast of Africa; so many according to the size of tho ship. They are paid in the Royal navy as sailors. Eroomen are employed, I believe, at the Island of Ascension, about 900 miles from their country. They never object to go to the Cape of Good Hope in ships of war. Captured slaves, called by us 'Lberated Africans,' with very few exceptions, have been foumd useless when employed on board ships of war. Mercbant ships will not take them; they are lazy and demand high wages." Sir H. Iluntley had also furnished Loxd Alalmesbury with tho following suggestions for regulating the employment of Kroomen in tho British 'West Indies :-" 1. K-roomen to bo shipped at no place in Africabut Sierra Leone. 2. Kroomen *hipped for the West Indies must be registered at Sierra Leone, and also in tho 'West Indies upon arrival. 3. Certain ports in tlhe Weast Iidfos to be named for the reeepslon of '(roomen. 4. Kroomen never to be taken to the West Indies upon speculation of being employed. 5. Before a ship can sail to get liroomen for the Weest Indies, the owners to make appli. cation for a license at the - office in England, showing a demand for a certain number, and naming in it the property upon which they are to bo employed in the West Indies; copy of the demand and license to bo sent to the registrar at Sierra Leonc. 6. Ships intended to carry kroomen to the West Indies to be fitted with propeller, and apparatus for obtaining fresh water from sea water. 7. Tonnage of ship to regulate number of kroomen carried on board. S. Xroomen in no case to be subject to corporeal punishment (magistrates or registrars should regulate between employer and man). 9. No registrar in chief to be a p pointed but from England-ho m ay appoinat deputies with the sanction of tho - office in England. 10. ]Kroomon not to be transferred or let out on hire In the West Indies, nor allowed to work upon any properly excepting that named in the license, vnithout the sa-nction 0 the registrar. j -p)hic and consent pt ibe p reppse s,"
THE IVDIAN MUJTIZIES. TO TEE EDITOR OF TE1E TIES Sir,-It is now nearly three weeks ago that the electric telegraph fires brought us news of an alarming character from India. Seven thousand of the native soldiery were in open revolt; massacres of Europeans had occurred at Meermt and other stations, and Delhi was in possession of the muti neers. We anxiously awaited more definite intelligence, and when the mail itself arrived public anxiety, which had been considerably excited, was partially allayed. Still, in. quiries were made in beth ilouses of Parliament as to the measures taken by tho Government to insure the safety of our Eastern possessions. The replies to these inquiries were decidedly reassuring. The crisis, it was sdd, had past, andtho revolt was not spreading; on the COntrary, many of the native regiments had given striking proofs of their loyalty, and were about to be employed, in conjunc. tion with Europeans, in the operations against DelhL A powerful force of British troops was concentrating at Meerut, and tho tranquillity of the greater portion of the Indian empire would allow of this measure without endan. gering the other Presidencies. It was also said that this force would immediately march upon Delhi, and that the very next mail would bring us the news of the capture of that city and the annihilation of the rebel band. Strong reinforcements, amounting to 14,000 men, were to be immediately sent out as a measure of precaution. People in England well versed in Indian affairs, the constitution of the Indian army, and the difficulties of an Indian climate smiled sadly at this overweening confidence, and anxiously awaited further news. The mail has now arrived, andhow are these sangaine expectations realized ? We find that 30,000 of the Bengal native troops have mutinied, or been disbanded; that those most trustedwhen the last mail left were now in open revolt; that the insurgent troops had twice moved out of Delhi and attacked the European force. Still the crisis is again said to have passed. It is possible that it may be so. I am no alarmist, and even if the worst occurs the state of affairs is neither hopeless nor discouraging. Biut a great and serious danger threatens India, and when the safety of a vast empire is at stake to act upon such possibilities is akin to madness. Measures should be immediately taken to guard against the worst that can occur. Let us look the evil in the face, and see how far it has extended, how far it may extend, and what system should be adopted for its repression. Delhi when the last mail left was the stronghold of rebellion, and to Delhi the most disaffected spirits were stiU flocking, and would continue to flock. None of the Bengal sepoys could be safely emplo3 ed, for it is one of the disadvantages of a state of insurrection that it is impossible to discriminate betweea the faithful and the false, and aU must be distrusted. On the other hand, the Sikhs and Goorkhas had hitherto proved loyal and shown no disaffection. The native troops of Bombay and Madras had shown no signs of a fellow-feeling with the mutineers of Bengal, and all was quiet in those Presidencies. A tolerably strong British force was in the immediate neighbourhood of Delhi, and on every occasion where collisions had occurred European courage and energy had invariably triumphed. This is a fair view of the present state of affairs. Let us now seo what probable dangers loom in the future, and the best means of guarding against them. We have a large body of disciplined and armed men now arrayed against us. Disaffection had spread through the Bengal army, and may extend into the other Presidencies, which are now almost denuded of European troops. Any success on the part of the rebels would in all probability work this change. The season of the year was the very worst for the movement of English troops, and, even if successful, these brave mnen must dissolve away like snow in sunshine; for even in the hour of triumph disease will lay its hand upon the victors, and call them from the scenes of their glory. This is the darker side of the picture, but it is not only possible, hut probable, for one of the worst features of tho present newsfrom India is the meagreness and uncertainty of the intelligence received, proving that our communications wcre not thoroughly open. Should the next mail bring us the news of disaffection in the other Presidencies, India has to be reconquered. Great stressislaid upon the fact of the native population being favourable to our rule, but this does not lessen the magnitude of our task; for even in the days of Clive this was not one of our difficuaties. The great danger now lies in the rebels boing able to form any sufficiently powerful nuclus to engender confidence in their cause, and also in their being able to interrupt our communications. We must hope that this will not be the case, but we must not hide from ourselves that it is highly possible. The very fact of the death of the Commander-in-Chief at such a time will be exaggerated, aud have a bad effect throughout the country. Let us now consider the best remedy for this widespread disease. We must first remember that, although 14,000 men are now on their way, or under orders for India, nearly half the number would have been sent had no rebellion occurred; they merely represent men who should be there, but who have died or been invalided during the past year. If we then allow for the immense amount of sickness tbat must be generated by the movement and employment of the European troops during the hot season, we cannot consider this whole number of men as more than sufficient to 8npply immediate casualties. We know how rapidly our forces in the Crimea recently melted awayunder the inuence of disease. We must remember that our countrymen in the East are now contending with a clinate that is tenfold more fatal and treacherous, wbere siolkness spread8 with much greater facility. NTow, we want more than the ordinary number of British troops usually employed in India to crush this revolt. We require reinforcements, and we should consider that every regiment now sent will rapidly decrease in numbers on its arrival. The drain on our army will be great, and a continuous stream of men should flow towards India, until every spark of mutiny has been stamped out. it least 15,000 more men should be immediately dospatched, so asto be available during the coming cold season. lt has over been the fault of this country to trifle w ith serious difliculties until aroused by necessity. Then the strength of England is put fortb, and a result ts at length obtained, but not until millions have been expended that might have been saved, and not until thousands near and dear to us have bravely perished, because unsupported properly by the country for which they died. The present emergency requires prompt and decisive action, and a large force should be despatohed, and when despatehed kept up to its effective strength. Cavalry will be peculiarly useful in the work that has to be done, and we are wofully weak in this arm at present. Artillery was the strong arm of the Indian service; but of course the native artilleryman cannot now be trusted. Some of the Royal Artillory should be sent out, who might take over their guns, horses, &c. The cavalry might be immediately mounted by takinS over the broken horses from the native cavalry regments that cannot be employed. It is absurd to talk of sending horses from England; they would he useless for at least two months aEter their arrival, and even then, if snt on a campaign, world suffer au bjvte-1y LzuLil uuease ox rne seer as zo ne utterly inelteetive. If necessary, some hundreds of broken horses from the Cape Corps might be sent on from the Cape, and would mount a dragoon regiment perfectly, as the whole of the horses of the 12th Lancers wero given over to that corps when the regiment went on to India. Cape horses are peculiarly suited to an Indian climate, and the voyage is not sufficientl long to render them unserviceable on their arrivaL We have now only two cavalry regiments in Bengal, one and a-half ab Bombay, and only two squadrons in the Madras Presidency. Flying columns of cavalry and horse artillery will have to patrol tho country and keep up the communication while the infantry regain and hold the position we have lost. A cavalry regiment should be sent to each Presidency in addition to the 2d and 3d Dragoon Guards. It is not safe to leave either lKirkee or Bangalore without any European cavalry, but if a dismounted regiment were sent to each of these places the old and splendid soldiers of the 12th Lancers might be concentrated at Bombay, and, together with the 14th and 2d Dragoon Guards and a large forco of Artilery, might move up the country on the commencement of tle cool weather, while the 3d and an additional regiment would start from Calcutta. It wouldbe a very unwise measure to send any infantry regiment from the Cape of GoodHope at present. Another Caffre war has been brewing for some time past, and is only kept down by the strong military force now holding the country. There would be no saving of time in doing so. Ceylon has been completely drained of Euro- ean troops, and is now only held by a small numter of Artillery and the Dlalay Ceylon Rifles; but the latter may be thoroughly trusted. In fact, we cannot spare an additional man from any of our adjacent colonies. This country must supply and keep up an army to recover our lost ground in the East, and we must not forget that we have a Chinese war also on our hands and an armed occupapation of Persia. Lotus nottrifle with these grave difficulties. Thousands of our follow-countrymen are now bravely doing their duty in those burning climes, and dying gladly to maintain the honour of tbeir country. Let us not desert them, but show that England is gratefiul for their deeds, and worthy of her name and fame. Xours truly, Ed IJTIUS.
ROBBERY BY MEANS OF CITIOROFOBra.-On Satur- day afternoon a man, who gave the name of Abel Smalley, but refused to state his address, was placed before the Mayor and magistrates at the Guildhall, Rochester, charged with baving administered chloroform to a sailor named William Young, and robbed him of five sovereigns. The prosecutor, who had just been paid off from Her Majesty's screw corvette Cossack, 21, was accosted by the prisoner, who was a total stranger to him, at the Sun-pier, Chatham, and, under pretence of assisting him with his things he bad brought ashore, persuaded him to enter a cab. This the sailor did and was immediately followed by the prisonor, the prosecutor being perfectly sober. Directly after entering the cab the sailor remembers that the prisoner suddenly threw his arm round his neck, immediately after which ho became insensible and could recollectnothing else. After driving for a short distance the cabman stopped to inquire where he should set his fare down, when he found the sailor quite infensible, and to all appearance dead, the prisoner having one arm round his neck and the other hand on his face. Prisoner then told the driver that he knew nothing about the sailor, and did not know where he was going, but the driver insisted on his getting out, aud had the sailor removed into a house, where he continued insensible for several hours, On recovering it was found that the prisoner had taken five sovereigns out of a tin case, which the sailor bad in the bosom of his dress. The prisoner, who denied all knowledge of the robbery, was oxdered to be rezwanded for farther examination,
BERA &2- E (From the Mrcltcur.) For yearsEBranger has not sang, bat France has learnt 'by his loss to what a degree he was ever dear and present to her-how the soul of his songs was part of her own soul, of her own immortal genius, whether she be considered as a race or as a people. The Emperor, by taking upon himself the charge of his faneral, ard by vishing, as it were, to preside over them in thought, has shown how in this, as in everythig else, his sentiments are those of France. Beranger, when he died, 'ead nearly completed his 77th year. Even his age wa. ss ertgraven on every memory, and the ate of his birth, when it became the subject of inquiry, always recurredin tDhe ahape of a sonug,- " DanascePari3 pleln d'or et de mI,8re, "En ran Co Christ mIS sent cernt quaser-vlng* "t^hezun thuer, men DaUrrO et vIso gcaa;d-pisr, *-Mol neuveau.nt, maca, z ce qosi n,svads&lt..,, > His life was simple, and by his good sense, his probity, and the moderation of his tastes, he rendered it conIsstent and dignified.. Whea he was young and in ioverty, notwithstanding the temptation of the age, he contnved by a I secret and obstinate toil to prepare a talent superior to the light and already charming ebllitions on which he tried his hand. A humble situation in a pLblic office was sufficient for his wants,andheheldit till he foundit was likely toconmpromise his independence. Then he became thoroughly fbee, and, taking his grand flight, as P minstrel-acknowledged by the young and by his native land, doat. log on the glories, and symnpathizing with the sorrows of France, whom he consoled by his reminiscences and his hopes, he desired no other vocation. In his old age. whenlhe saw more events corne tr pass than doubtlesshehai expected, when he found himself a bett-r prophet than he had supposed himself to be, he had the wisdom still to remain the great and simple poet he had always been, with. out repudiating the prodigious public results to which he had contributed to the best of his power. B6ranger had naturally that patriotic soul that cannot be communicated. He was susceptible of joys and sorrows which have never been felt by many literary gentlemen who have applauded him, but which are felt at once by a people. Hence thAtlongintimacy between the people and Branger, notwithstanding these finesses which popular works do not absolutely require. The invasions of 1814 and 1815, the fall of the " Grand Empire," the degradation of the "braves," andtheinsolent tritumph of the "ineapables"-the Myrmidons vauating themselves on the car of Achillesthese were to him sources of grief, indignation, and derision -occasions for vengeful reprisals. No one understood better than Beranger how much the genius of Napoleon was; at a certain perod, identified with that of France, how much the national pride and the pride of tho hero were, in fact, the same, andhow one defeat was common to them both. No one has better shown how the day of reparation for both these glories-the glory of France and that of the name of Napoleon-belonged to one and the same cause. He saw this as a poet, but the poet sawfurther than many apolitician, and when the dream was realized B6ranger the honest man had the good sense not to belie B6ranger the poet. Is it necessary to remind those generations of his immortal songs who from the age of 20 to the age of 60 knew them all by heart? Such, for instance, as that which is the first of its class, but is still gay and lively, because victory still (January, 1814) shows the prospect of a brilliant change- "Galt ga! I errcns nos rang, "Espisance *De la France; Galt galtl sersos noe rang; En avant, Gaulois et Franc l" and, indeed, all those in which, af ter so many humiliations and defeats, he begins, as a sympathetic poet, to probe and dress the wounds of brave hearts? In 1819 the allies have at last quitted the soil of Fraace, which they occupied, and Bedranger exclaims:- Relue du monde. O France, 8 ma patrlel S3uleve enfin ton front CcatrOlc I . With Beranger it is sufficient to give the key-note ; everyone follows in his train. What finer hymns than Le Ccrq aci, Le vicsx Sergcnt, Le ricuc T'peau, 5Le Clhant dar Cosaque, Waterloo, ever emanated from a national and warlike soul? B6ranger, more than any other, has kept alive in France the worship of glory and the noble symbols with which it is connected in the heroic annals of the age- Qouasd Bsoefral-je In po tese age Qai ternit ses nobles couleursa" The tricoloured flag was the banner of B6ranger. Once it reappeared. but without the eagle; and hence it was not complete. B6ranger saw this day, in which all his friends took some parb in affairs, and all were more or less ministers; but, nevertheless, he never saug in honour of the halftriumph. Was this beeause he loved always to be the poet of the vanquished, never the poet of the conquerors? We cannot beohve anything of the kind. A victory gallantly achieved Is to agenninepoet asiruch asource of inspiration as a noble defeat. In 1830, and the years that immediately followed, Beranger sang but little, or not at all, because his feelings as a patriot were but half satisfied. He kuew all that could be said by the wise and the prudent, and even said it himself, but the poetical part of his nature felt a regret; and when, gradually and successively military days honourable to that politic Governmont which he assisted actuaUy arrived, he did not-patriotic poet as he was-feel an unmingled and inspiring joy. There was not then to be found an ample compensation for that mournful day oh' which he had said,- " eon nom jamals n'attrirtera mea vera" As yet there was nothing to silence the insulting song of the savage victor, whom he had represented as exclaiming, irt the dnkenness of his joy,- ' Retourne boire a Is seine rebelle, "Oti toet ranglant to tes lav6 deur fols- Ileanis d'orguelU. o mon coarsier fidele "Et foula sax pieds les pouples et lesroi LI' However, B6ranger lived to see the days of ample repara tion-the days of victorious struggle, and, doubtlees, if his muse had been 20 years younger, she would have found notes fortheir celebration. " le raetour cle 1'arwuCc dc CrimWe et son ertr6c dans Paris,"-what a theme for a song by Beranger ! His last songs, which have not yet been published, and 'which have only been communicated to some of his friendin confidence, are, we are informed, in the style of the $ourc7irs due Peup7e: "On parlera de sa Oglire "e Sons la ebanie bien longteiap3. "1'arle-soua de ota, gsandos5mre, " Parlez-nous delua I" These are epic songs in their way, finished and severe in point of form, and intended to mark certain moments in that grand destiny of Napoleon which occupied B6ranger to the last jealous as he was to identify more and more his own popurity with the glory of the Emperor. Bcranger, during the latter years of his life, before he was confined to his room by the malady to which ho at last fell a victim, was remarkable for a rare quality that denotol the excellence of his disposition. He was the, most actively oblifing and serviceable of mankind. HolAfured by all, findmg none but friends and admirers, and desiring nothing for himself, he still ventured to ask for others; few persons ever applied to him without deriving some advantage from the application. He excelled in giving practical and appro. priate advice. His letters, naturally bast carefully written. have assuredly been treasured up by all who have received them, and a charming collection could be made of them, as a moral treasure, in the st-yle of Franklin. Such a collection would offer a new hut not unforeseen aspect of his moral character. There will be frequent opportunities to direct public attention towards a fame that has long been an universal patrimony. At presentit will be sufficient to point out that superior powrer of talent by which a poet so light and often to brilliant in his gaity has dexterously and successfully continued to engrave his name upon the most indestructible marbles of history.
SLAVERY n TME UNITED STATES.-RUNAWAY SLAVESM-On Sunday last three slaves-two belongin' to Mr. J. Sanford, and one to Mr. J. Berry, made tracks from Henry county, Kentucky. They were traced across the Ohio River, and on Monday discovered hidden in the brush and behind logs, aboutx four miles back from tho river, on Kane's Branch. The negroes, being armed, mado a desperate resistance, and one of them, belonging to Berry, while in the act of shooting Mr. James Humphreys, one of his pursuers, was shot, and instantly killed. The second escaped, while the third was arrested and taken back to eientueky.-Cincinmati Commercial, June 24. Large Sale of Slaves.-The slaves belonging to the estate of Reuben Chaney, deceased, were sold on Monday last to the hi"hest bidder, in tho southern part of this county, at the foflowing unprecedented prices:-Winston, 23 years old, $1,580; Daniel, 19, $1,540; Abner, 25, $1,395; Ralph, 27, $1,205; woman and child, 28, i, 100; Sarah, 25, $930Jack, 9, $975; Caroline, 7; $585; Francis, 5, $5300 Orange and Vica. 60, ji$00; Jane, 3, $405; Ellen, 11, blind in one eye, $315; Nancy, 2, $-310; Vina, 50, $280; Roda, 65, $2o-tota], $11,545. These rlaves were not bought by tho heirs, but wore purchased by citizens of this county. This, we believe, is the largest lot of slaves ever sold in the county, and the prices are higher than ever before paid.-Futuon Telegraph. & DEATH OF THE HON. W. L. MIVRcy.-ThO sad intelligence that William L. Marcy is no more will be heard with feelings of profoundest sorrow and regret, not only in this, the State in which he lived, but in every State in the Union. He was found dead in his room at Ballston, Saratoga county, last Saturday noon. When last seen he seemed to be in the enjoyment of his wonted health and spirits. Born in Stourbridge, Massachusetts, in 1786, he was consequently.71 years of age at the time of his death. Early in life, after graduatirgat BrownUniversity, inlRhode Island, he removed to this State, and commenced the practice of the legal profession at Troy, of which city he became Recorder in 1816. and after occupying the higbest stations of trust, respon-ibility, and honour which the citizens of Newv York could confer upon him,-Adjutant.General in 1821, Conptroller in 1823, Judge of the Supreme Court in 1829, United States' Senator in 18b1, Governor in 1833, to which office he was twice re-elected, -he was selected by aucceessive national Execatives to fill the post in each Cabinet which for the time bein' was the most arduous and prominent. As Secretary oE War under President Polk, we are largely indebted to his energy, activity, and skill for the successful prosecution ot a contes' which gave fresh lustre to the laurels of the ATmerican army, and added California and New Mexico to the Republic. His sagacious use of the means a' his disposal to render the army as efficient as possible, without increasing the taxation or having recourse to any extraordinary expedient,-the ability with which the war was brought to a close,-and the magnaniu,ity which was disDlayed in the conclusion of peaco, are alike honourabla to bimself and the country. As Secretary of State unde. General Pierce, the career of the great statesman was no: less distinguished, although in a different sphere o' action. His management of theenlistment question, andhi, diplomatic controversy with the Earl of Clarendon on Central American affairs, together with the. many able State papers which issued from his pen during his four years' tenure of office, are fresh in the recollection of the public, and entitled him to the highest rank among the leading men of his time. His firmness, sagacity, strong Conservative tendencies, unswerving patriotism, sterling integrity, and eminent ability as a statesman won him the respect and confidence of all parties in his own country, and caused his name to be universally honoured abroad, while in private life few enjoyed a larger circle of devoted and ad. j inUu5 fsioiIea,--N;W Yor7 Journa4 of CQomi?Wt ff I I I I I
PROPZRTY LOST IN CABS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIM3ES. Sir,-A few years since it was understood that a law had beea passed to compel cabmen, among other things, to present a ticket of the number of their cab to persons engaging them at tho commencement of their fare; and I well remember that at that period I not unfrequently had such tickets given to me. Latterly, however, I have not even seen one of these tickets, and I have just learnt the reason in a practical way which not a few of your readers will be interested in, as, indeed, the very frequent advertisements for property lost in c-abs will abundantly prove. Your impression of this very morning contains four such. Last night I had been to the Lyceum opera. About midmight I entered a cab 'in Wellington-street, and found on one of the seats a large double opera-glass, which I took up immediately with the Intention of depositing itat the proper office for restoration to the right owner. One of the low touters for cabs saw me do this while pestering me in the usual way for something under the false pretence of having I etched me the vehicle, and when I refused to give him anything he named it to the driver, who was somewhat in liquor. I then got out of the cab, and told the latter my intention. He said he would have it and give it to the owner, whom he knew himself. Knowing the frequent character of these persons, I refused to surrender the article, on which the mob around urged him to seize it out of my hands; and he did as they told him. I asked bis number in vain, and in the darkness and confusion he would pro.' bably son have got off unknown with the glass, and I should have been lucky to escape -without a brokea head, but fortunately Policeman F 78 was at hand to rescue me and the property. At my request we drove off to Bow-street station together, and, notwithstanding all this, I found' -it rather diftiult to reply to the question of the inspector on duty and say what charge I had to make. I suggested the neglect to give me a ticket on entering the cab. Every traveller in Paris and other continental cities will remember the practice and valne of such a precaution; and so it was thought a short time since that we in London had at length attained this not very high degree of care for the public safety. But, no. Either ourlawgivershave not sointended it, or the bungling lawyer who drew theAct has not fulfilled their intentions; or perhaps the matter is too great or too little for our Police Commissioners and new Parliament-men to try to remedy. The inspeetor on duty at Bow-street told me that the understood law was practically inoperative, as the ticket was, by some decisions, considered to be claimable only at the end of the journey, and thus was commonly neglected altogether. I left the cabman in the inspector's hands, and the opera-glass was to be advertised in that second column of your truly valuable Journal vhich contains a record of so many things lost in cabe, and, alas I so very few fonnd. For, aiter all this cabman who had wirenched the glass from my hands, saying it belonged to some one in Norfolk-street, Strand, could not tell the name of the ownuer or the numbher of his house. Surely, this is but one instance out of hundreds daily occurring in whicb the delivery of a ticket at the commencement of a fare would be found most usefuL According to your rule I enclose my card, while begging here to subscribe myself, YOuPM ohedisntlv.

MuRusust AwD SuicsnF.-On Friday a hairdresser lat Glocester, named George uMorley, drowned himself and his two daughters, one aged 14 and the other 9, in the Glocester and Berkeley ship canal. Froi the evidence Egvenu at the inquest, which was held on Saturday, by Mr. Loveprove, coroner, it appeared that the bodies of tho father and his youngest daughter, Augasta -were found in the canal, about a mile from GloGester. They were lying about six fEet from the bank, and in about eigat feet of water. The odies were linked together ; the father had his left arm passed round his daughter's waist and grasped her wrist with his left band, while his right arm was curved, as though he had held his eldest daughter in the same maner as the younger, but she had got from him. Shortly afterwards the body of Elizabeth was found ia the channel of the canal, in from 15 to 20 feet of water, and about that distance from where the other two bodlies were discovered. According to the testimony of the widow, the father, who was much attached to his ch-ldren, on the previous day took out the two girls aprfor a walk," and he had for some time been ia a depresd state from disease, as well asfrom pecuary difficulties. Thejury returned a verict that " The deceased caused the death of his two children and committed suicide while in a state of temporary insanity."

Several of the passngers Who were most injured wera carried to hotels at CheltenLam, and medical aid was promptly in attendance. Four. *een passngers were injured. One woman, residing t Glocester, was throwni with great violence against the side of the.carriage and bad her nose and face very much inued. She was removed to the Qaeen's Hotel at Chelten. Inam.
