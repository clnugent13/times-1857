RjEERA.YDEL FESTI VALATTHEW OUYSTAL PALACE. The success of the first performance, which took I place yesterday-beginning at 1 o'clock and termi- natingat5-farsurpassedexpectation. Laigprevios! to the commencement of the oratorio a brillant company had assembled, and the Crystal Ptalace, from end to end-the nave and courts and gaileries, the terraces outside, and the gardens bene-ath the terracea -was alive with visitors anxious in anticit,ation of the musical treat to come. Beforethe appointed hour the majority of the numbered places in the central transept were occupied, and the adjacent blocks of seats in the north and south naves were teuanted soon after. The galleries, more remote and less easy of access, had been filled earlier, so that when the principal singera entered the orchestra, and Mr. Costa (who was loudly greeted) had taken his place in front of the conductor's desk, there were not many vacant spots to dwell upon. Not that the crowd was inconvenient. On the contrary, the fact that Her Majeaty the Queen had intiwated her intention of presiding at the performance of -Tuda Maccablcxss on Wedneaday no doubt kept all those away who would be likely to attend such a celebration in obedience to fashion and an appetite for show, rather than for love of music and reverence for the name and memory of the greatest of sacred composers. There were thousands enough present, however, to realize everything that had been predicted of the splendour of the scene. The weather vvas superb, the sky unclouded as in the sunniest Italian landscape, and the interior of the Palace looked nothing short of enchanting. A prospect was revealed, indeed, which dazzled the eye of the beholder, and suggested the idea of some gigantic kaleidoscope, peopled with multitudinous objects in every variety of form and colour. It is unnecessary to attempt a new description of a scene so closely resembling that we endeavoured to portray in the notice of Saturday's rehearsal-and the more so since whatever remains to be said will derive additional weight and interest when embodied in the report of to-morrow's proceedings, which, as we have stated, are to be graced with the presence of Royalty. Moreover, the first day of the Handel Festival belongs of right to Handel, whose immortal Messiah was given in Buch a manner and with such a prodigality of resources as may justly be styled unprecedented. But there was an episode of the festival, which, in its way, was quite as curiouis and as unusual as the great commemoration itself. We mean the aspect which all the approaches to the Palace, both by road and rail, presented as the tide of visitors gradually set in. The doors of the building were not to open till 11, and, though even those who came latest were sure of their numbered seats, yet the " early bird" mnaxim seemed to animate everybody. This was particularly the case with those who came by rail. So premature were these visitors at the station that it was found necessary to commence running the trains soon after nine; and from that time till the oratorio had fairly begun there was no pause or slack of passengers. The railway arrangements were very good. On these great public fltes most persons seem to come armed with the determination to push and be pushed, and carry their notion out on the very first favourable opportunity. Bow, if the much-enduring public would only consent to forego this idea, they would be considerably the gainers, both in bodily comfort and rate of progression towards the place they wish to reach. Eagerness may, and often does, induce fouir people to crowd into a place where only one can stand with comfort; but, no matter what the interest of the spectacle, the public may depend that push as they like they will never overcome the natural laws which prevent two persons from occupying ths same spot at once. If this last general principle is kept in view, the visitors tomorrow will get their places in the trains and palace both more quietly and more easily. The road from Dulwich to the Palace yesterday had an appearance which we can only expect to see again to-morrow. It seemed a kind of Harmonic Derby day, but in every respect more orderly than the mixed riotous concourse which always marks that great equestrian Saturnalia. All the pathways and hedgerows were lined with spectators, and on the lawns outside villas were groups of seated ladies, which gave to the whole road the aspect of a long fite clampetre. At the wretched little turnpike two stout collectors gathered the money, and had enough to do. The Dulwich tollbar will soon be rich enough to take its place among the institutions of the country, for it has acquired the rare secret of taking much and expending little. There was a good deal of delayat this gate yesterday, chiefly caused by the visitors themselves, not one in a hundred of whom, or their servants, were ready with the money. The consequent fumbling for gold or silver, with the delay of getting change in nearly every case, caused a hinderance to the progress of vehicles which was most annoying. The remedy for this, however, is very simple, and in the hands of the visitors themselves. They know the toll fare well by this time,-let them have it ready on demand. The gate once passed the carriages moved on rapidly, mounted police directing aU to their respective entrances, according as their occupants bad pink, green, or buff tickets. By this admirable arrangement everything like confusion or hurry was avoided. An immense crowd of people were collected outside the building, andremained therethroughout the entire performances. They were certainly not unrewarded, for during the choruses the peal of voices seemed to swell from the building and fill the air as though the Palace itself was a vest organ. The Hallelujah chorus could be distinctly heard nearly half a-mile from Norwood, and its effect, as the sound floated on tlle wind, now high now low, was impressive beyond description, and sounded as if a nation was at prayers. The change determined on at the rehearsal in the position of the choristers, by means of which the female singers were all brought together in front of the organ and were conspicuous from every point, not only afforded an agreeable relief to the eye, but added materially to the effect of the music. The diflfrent choral parts being now well balanced, the thunder of the men's voices no longer overpowered the more mellifluous tones of their fair companions and fellow-labourers. Another desirable improvement was achieved by the establishment of screens at the back and sides of the orchestra, through which contrivance the sound, instead of escaping into the empty galleries and corridors inthe immediate neighbouirhood of that enormous amphitheatre of timber, was thrown directly upon the area devoted to the audience. Among other objects in the orchestra that attracted general interest were a portrait, a bust, and a full-length statue (in marble) of the great musician in whose honour this festival was instituted. The portrait, hung in front of the organ, was the one painted from life by Denner, which Handel bequeathed to his amanuensis, John Christopher Smith, whose lineal descendant, Lady Rivers, recently made a gift of it to the Sacred HEarmonic Society. It is said, on good authority, to be one of the best likenesses extant. The statue on the right, for which Handel sat (also in possession of the Sacred Harmonic Society), is by Poubac. fHorace Walpole, in one of his letters, aurfms tnat this statue laid the foundation of Ronbillac's fame in Englaud. It was his first great work; and it is worth noting that his last was Handerls monument in Westminster Abbey. A cast of it has been forwarded by the Sacred Harmonic Society to Berlin, for the statue to be erected at Halle (the birthplace of the composer) at the centenary commemoration in 1859, upon which a Berlinese sculptor, favoured by His Prussian MIajesty, is busily engaged. The bust, on the left, is cast from one belonging to the musical collection in the Royal Library at Berlin. The namle of the artist is unknown. Tbe Messiah, as every one who cares for music is aware.. was composed in 1741-planned, sketched, and meapleted in the miraculously brief period of 22 days, .kving been commenced on the 22d of August and finighed on the 12th of September ! A fortnight after thig the first part of Samss was on paper. S,ch prodigious rapidity, the very elaborate character of the music considered, would be incredible had we not the authority of Handers own dates for the fact. Thji imperishable masterpiece was first performed in Dubhlu on the 13th of April, 1742, withtheutmcstsuecess. ]gowthisdecisionof the sister isle has been stamped by thk, approving verdict of the civilized world-how nearly a century and a-qus,ter h s elapsed since the compoa,'tion Of the .essi4s! without robbing it of one atom of its attraction-, how to this day, when music has mnade such strideo and gone through so m4ny phases, when Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendeluohn hWe lived ac VnX = nd 4di muAiicUm adl1tv.t Btrengthened by the unanimous popular opinion, still look up to it as the greatest piece of eacred music whichthe ayt can boast, we need hardly insist. The solemn and impressive effect of its performance at theunprecedented celebration yesterday, the devout attention, edification, and delight of the multitude assembled to hear it, sufficiently attested that the Messiah was not a work for yesterday, to-day, or to-morrow, but for all time-one of those inspirations of genius for which we can only account by attributing them to a higher source than that of simple humau agency. Through its means Handel has not only been a beacon to the worshippers of art, but a benefactor to his species-since it has fed charities and promoted the objects of true religion, besides charming and refining the world by its wealth of musical beauty, for upwards of a century. There is no parallel for it in any other artistic form through which mortalgifts and ingenuity have been manifested. The performance, as we have suggested, was wonderfully succesfuL Thegreatest effects, it may readily be imagined, the extent and peculiarities of the arena being taken into consideration, were produced by the choruses, of which the Messiah affords so astonishing a variety. All of these " went" more or less well, while some surpassed in grandeur of tone, precision, and unanimity anything we can call to mind. The most irreproachable were naturally those in which the occurrence of florid passages is least frequent, and broad and massive harmony is tho prominent characteristic. The very first chorus, "And the glory of the Lord," at once disclosed the signal advantage gained by the new disposition of the female voices. The trebles more partieularly, which at times were scarcely audible during rehearsal, now came out with penetrating clearness. " And He sball purify the sons of Levi" is one of those choral pieces abounding in florid divisions, and here there was a good deal of occasional usteadiness, especially (strange enough, their depth and solidity of tone considered) among the basses, which, swinging to and fro, were only prevented from going astray by the marvellous decision of Mr. Costa's beat. " For unto us a child is born" was perfect. Mr. Costa (calculating, no doubt, from the experience of Saturday's rehearsal) discarded the "pianissimo" at the commencement; and thus the advent ef the Messiah was declared in accents of becoming exultation. The grand burst-" Wonderful, Counsellor"-lost nothing by this, but rather gained, since a moment's reflection must convince any one of the absurdity of uttering the preceding words-"His name shall be called"-in a tone scarcely audible, while the close of the annunciation -" Wonderful, Counsellor"-the name itself-is shouted with the utmost possible loudness. The audience, moved to enthusiasm by so fine a performance, redemanded it obstreperously; and their applause continued until the pastoral symphony had been played half way through; but the conductor was inexorable, and resolutely declined to interrupt the course of the oratorio, for which he is entitled to the thanks of all discreet persons. After "His yoke is easy," the oreheetra dispersed, the majority of the audience imitated their example, and eating and drinking were the order of the day. Nearly all the superb choruses in Part II-the Passion, the contempiation by man of the heavenly power, the persecution of the Gospel teachers, and the triumph-w ere admirably given, the only evidence of indecision being observed in " All we like sheep," last but one of that magnificent chain of choral movements inaugurated with such heartrending pathos in "Surely he hath borne our griefs." Here again we bad most frequently to complain of the basses, who were also now and then unsteady during the majestic fugue, " He trusted in God," in other respects faultless. The " Eallelujah" (during which, according to traditional custom, the whole assembly remained standing) was grand beyond description. To be brief, no less can be said of the astounding chorus, - "Worthy is the Lamb," with which the oratorio terminates. The "Amen" was equal in all respects to the "Hallelujah," and constituted a fitting climax to one of the most impressive and exciting performances ever heased of the Messiah. The instrumental orchestra distinguished itself honourably throughout. The fugue in the overture and the fugal symphonies in the final chorus brought out the strength and quality of the violins with surprising effect; and the aecompaniments were played with a delicacy and precision worthy of all praise. By the side of the chorus the solo singers, in such a place and under such circumstances, could hardly be expected to shine to much advantage. The florid airs were, of course the least distinctly audible, and consequently the ieast effective. Thus Madame Clara Novello produced a far better impression in " Come unto Him," and " I know that my Redeemer liveth," than in "Rejoice greatly;" Mr. Sims Reeves obtained his greatest successes in " Comfort ye my people" and "'rnou shalt break them; " Miss Dolby pleasea most in " He was despised," and Herr Foiaes in " The people that walked in darkness." Two of the bass songs, however, "Why do the nations" (Mr. Weis), and "The trumpet shall sound" {Eerr Formes), made, we are at a loss to explain why, excaptions to the rule. In the last the trumpetplaying of Mr. T. Harper called for unquaffied eulogy. At the same time, it must be added, all these accomplished artists sang their very best, and nsed every effort to do honour to the great cominemoration in aid of which their services had been called into requisition, often triumphantly vanquishing the obstacles presented by the unaccustomed (liunensions of the arena in which they were exhibiting, and extorting the warmest applause from the audience. What, however, after suah choruses as "H Iallelujah," and some dozen otbers, delivered from the united throats of 2,000 singers, can reasonably be expected from one h,olthary voice-soprano, tenor, contralto, or bassa We should have mentioned that the oratorio was preceded by the National Anthem, the principaL solos being sung by lI3adame Novello. The audience dispersed with as much order as they had assembled. Too much praise cannot be given to the 150 stewards, who-under the direction of Mr. Davis Sims, superintendent of stewards at the Sacred Harmonic Society-managed to find everybody his place with the utmost expedition and without any confusion or inconvenience. This was no easy task when so many thousands of persons had to be seated. All the plans, however, were as simple and intelligible as they were efficacious. This afternoon (at half-past 2) Mr. Best, organist of St. George's-hall, Liverpool, is to perform a selection of compositions by HIandel on the now organ built by Messrs. Gray and Davison for the festival.
DiN-1ER To SIR WILLr.x. JOLLTS'E, M.P.-A dinner wa given to Sir Wilham Jolliffe, MhP., at the Carl. ton Club on Saturday last, in recognition of his great services to the Conservative party, at whicb 190 gentlemen (chiefly members of the two Houses of Parliament) were present, being the utmost number which the dining-room could accommodate. The chair was occupied by the Earl of Derby. The entertainment being in its character a privAte one, wedonot fL-1 justified in noticingitin its details,'butthe position of the hon. member for Peterafield in reference to the Conservative party, and the estimation in which he is held, are such as to warrant some general remarks upon this occasion. The public are little aware of the importance of the functions belonging to the offices filled at the preSent time by Mr. Hayter and Sir William JoDiffe. The ma. chinery of our great political parties, at all timescomplicated and difficult to manage, at this present juncture, we need scarcelyremark, is complicated in no ordmary degree. Mr. Hayter and Sir William Jolliffe may be considered as the engineers who work these great machines, and their good or bad working depends mainly upon the qualifications of the engineers. If the Government is fortunate in having such a man as Mr. Hayter, the Opposition is not less fortunate in Sir WiLUiam Jolliffe, and each of these gentlemen sesses qualities adapting him singularly to the chief and to the party to whom bis services are so useful. We are disposed to give every credit to the qualifications of Mr. Hayter. Lilke his chief, he thoroughly understands the House of Commons. Like him he has the advantage of extraordinary adroitness, dexterity, presence of mind, and good temper. If he is some. bhat unacrupulous, so is Lord Palmerston ; and, as Lord Palmerston bas kept together his party when no other statesman could have done so, it cannot be denied that Mr. Hayter h88 Eas tho party on thera eccason vs byehis benter eyed at this parenty onme severa oesvs tbey wIbes ouner, Promptitude, and accuracy of information.

SOUTHAMPTONx, June 15.-A fire, which at one period assumed a very threatening appearance, broke out this afternoon in the docks, but it was fortunately got under withoat any damage being dono. An immense quantity of shavngs, the accumulation of years, from the ship repairs carried on in the docks lines the outer shore of the southern bank of the inner dock, and by some means a portion of these shavings ignited, it is supposed from one of the workmen smoking. A strongly south-easterly wind was blowing, and the fire soon extended to a length of 50 or 100 yards, throwing up dense volumes of smoke, which rolled over tae lower art of the town, at first creating some alarm. The fire9eil at the dockgate was rung, and in a few minutes eight or 10 engines (including those of the Dock Company, the several steam companies, and the town) were playing upon the flames. Everybody lent a ready assistance, andia the course of a couple of hours from its disoovery the fLre was subdued, its ravages being happily confined to the bank of shavings in which it originated. The eastern end of a long line of coalsheds was at one time on fire, but, being immediately discovered, the engines were brought to bear upon it, and the flames were extinguished before any harm was done. STEs TO NEW YORKE-SOUTHAMPTON, Monday. -Tke United States' mail steamship Hermanin, Captain Higgins, and the steamer North Star (of the Vanderbilt line), Captain Lefevre, arrived from Bremen yesterday evening, and both vessels sail hence on Wednesday for New York. Captain Higgins being about to relinquish the command of the iermnann,a very handsome silvertea andcoffea service, bearing an appropriate inscription, was presented to him to-dayfrom tLe inhabitants of Southampton, by whom he is held in great respect. The presentation was made by Mr. J. R. Stebbing, J.P., President of the Chamber of Commerce, in the presence of several of the leading comnmercisi men of the town, assembled for the purpose in the saloon of the ahip, and was acknowledged by the gallasnu Captai Sn suitable terms. Captain Higgins has commanded the Hermann about five years. ATRoCIoUs CRuELTY.-On Friday at the policecourt, before Mr. Mlansfield, a case unparalleled for atroaity was partly investigated. Henry Rogers, the captain of the ship Martba Jane, of Sunderland, Charles E. Seymour, his chief mate, and William Mills, his second mate, were charged with having taken the life of a sailor, named Andrew Bose, on the voyage between Demerara and InverpooL Mr. Inspector iehoe opened the case. He said the prisoners belonged to the ship Martha Jane, of Sunderland. Henry logers was her captain, Charles E. Seyinour was her ohief, and William Mils her second mate. The charge against them was for causing the death of one Andrew Rose, who was shipped as an able seaman on board that veesel at Demerara. The vessel sailed from that port on the 11th of May, and the crew consisted of 11 able eeamen, of which Rose, now dead, was one, and besides she had a cook, carpenter, And steward. It would seem that the man was rather of light intellect, and that at the time he went on board he was suffering from diarrhcea. It seemed that he did not on some occasions go to the proper water-closet, and for this the captain beat him most severely with a whip, and the mates also beat him with ropef'ends until his body became black and blue, and lacerated in several parts. It aso would be proved that the prisoners continued to beat him every day from the day the vessel sailed untU he died. Before he died, however, his arms, legs, feet, andother portions of his bodybroke out ito rightful holes and running ulcers. His body was swollen, and bruised from head to foot, by the terrble beatings inflieted on him bv the throe prisoners. There was a ferocious dog named Wateh kept on board, and the cap. tain frequently set this dog at the deceased, both when m and out of irons, and the animal used to tear mouthfuls of flesh from the man, and inflict desperate wounds on him, which bled profusely. When the dog observed the prisonsrs beating the man, which was at least once a day, it wouldflyathimandtearawa flesh,leavingstreamsof blood isung from the wounds. On one oecasion, when he wa6 in irons, and could not stir more than a yard, he was treated in the most abominable manner by the captain. The details of this portion of the case were so pre-eminently disgusting that we cannot publish them; suffice it, however, to say that the most horrible fith was forced into his mouth with a stick by the captain, while the other two prisoners held his arms. His nose was stopped, and other terrible treatment practised towards bim. After this he was taken out of irons, and, by direction of the captain the other prisoners unheaded a water cask, into which ie was put by the three prisoners. The cask was then headed in the usual way, and lashed down in Its place. This was at 12 o'clock in the day, and he was left in that way until 12 at night, with the bunghole upwards. After mentioning some further atrocities, the inspector stated that about two days before the vessel arrived off Cape Clear the man was taken by one of his comrades to the forecastle, when he got some of his tea, and next day he was called upon by the captain, who gave him what appeaed to be some castor oil and brandy. Tbis did not seem to have any effect on him, and the next day hegotialikedose. Some tim after, in the morning of the same day, the man died, and at 12 ws thrown overboard, just a he wag, a most frightful spectacle.

Viscount DUNGANNON- presented petitions from various plawce in Ireland against the Bil for the Abolitic of Ministers! Mioney. The Earl of WICKLOW presented a petition from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, stating that great misappre. hension urevauled as to their being able to pay tbe stipends of the clergymen who would suffer from the abolition of ministers' money, that so far from that being the cue they had not funds adequate for the purposeo for which their bodyws originally constiteted, and praying that before the second reading t1ey might be heard by counsel at the bar of their lordship3' ouse,in order that they might have an opportunity of removing those misappieheosions. The Earl of EGLINTON presented a petition from Ayr. hire, praying for some further reattricon i pon dram shops, and also a petition from Leith, numerously signed, com. plaining of the operation of Warburton's Anatomy Act. Earl VANE preeanted a petition from the civil servants of the Crown employe in the service of the Customs at the port of Stcckton.on.Tees, in the county of Durham, praying for the abolition of the superannuation-tan. MINISTERS' MONEY. The Earl of DERBY gave notice that it was his intention on the second reading of this Bill to mnove that it bo read s second time that day six months. OBSCENE PUBLICATIONS AND PRINTS. Lord CAMPBELL laid on the table of the House a Bill to check the sae sad irculation of ooscene books andpicturesan evil which, he believed, only required tshe interposition of the law to check. The Bill was framed upon the same principle as the Betting-houses Bill, and allowred a right of sebarch, with thbe pow er of seizing man caring away those The Bill was read a first time. PETITIONS. TheEarlof DERBYpresenteda petition from agentleman named Moore, praying for oompensation for having been deprived of the right of taking she on a portion of the coast of the iland of Portland. In 1843 Count Chreptovitch obtained from the Government a license to take shale on the coast of thi island, which he afterwards made over to a company of which Mr. Moore was a prnoipa member. In 1847 land was taken for the construction of Portland harbour, which interfered with that right, and for the loss he had suffered Mr. Moore now sought, but was unable to obtain, compensation. Lord STANLE Y of ALDERLEY was understood to say tat the lease held by Count Chreptovitch never having been asigned to Mr.Mioore, that gentleman had no claim to com,oensation. The Earl of DONOUGHMOWRE presented two petitions from civil servants of the Crown against the Superannuation, Act,-one from the department of the Board of Public Works (Ireland), and the other from the receiver of the Irish Constabulary-office. TOLLEMACHE'S DIVOROE. Lord BROUGHEA moved that the petition of Henry Bertie Tollemache for leave to bring in a Bill to declre his marriage with Amelia Madeline Louisa Sinclair, otherwise Tollemache, otherwise Power, to have been ditsolved and made void as from the 3d day of July, 1841 (presented on Tuesday last), be referred to a select committee. The LORD CHANCEILOR suggested that the petition should be referred to a committee to search forzprecedents. Lord BROUGHAM said, ho had no obiection to this course, and The petition was then ordered to be referred to a committee to search for precedents. THE PRINCESS ROYAI'S ANNUITY BIUL This Bill was read a third time and pased. THE ROYAL HIBERNIAN ACADEMY. Lord TALBOT DE MALAEIDE presented a petition from the President and cera in other members of the Boyal flibwrnian Academy complaining of mismanagement. The noble lord said he should not enter into the details of the petition ashe did not entirely agreed with it but he had reason to beieve that there had been considerable differences of opinion between the members of the Academy as to its management, which were not calculated to be advantageous to it. It was absolutely necesary that something should be done, althoughJhe did not think that any good would regult from a general inquiry, either by a eommission or by a comsnittee. He hoped, however, that the Government would give teirattetion to the subject. THE BURIAL-GROUNDS ACT. Earl FORTESCOE presented a Petition from the burial board of St. Thomas, Exeter, for an alteration of the law respecting the closing of old burial-grounds and the consecration of new ones. The noble earl, in presenting the petition, was understood to refer to various disputes which have lately taken place between the Bishop of Exeter and burial hoards in his diocess respecting the consecration of new burialgrounds! but as the noble earl spoke in a low tone of voice, wvith his back to the gallery, it was impossible to catch more tbaa few words here and there. Loid WENSLEYDATE-eipreied a hope that in the case referred to %he Bishop of Exeter had taken counsel as to the exact meaning of the terms of the canon relating to bural-grounds. No doubtthe rightre prelate had acted conscientiously, but nevertheless it would be found that the termns of the canon applied to the churchyards of parishes, the only places of burial which existed at the time the canon was framed. As the law nowr stood, a certain pcortion of every burying-groundthat was essablished was to be set apart and distinguished from that portion which was not consecrated, and, a ha understood, that course had been taken in the present instance. Lord CAMPBE.L would abstain from giving ay opinion on the present case, but he implored the House to take some means to amend the law, so as to prevent the occur. renos of those distressing scenes that now so frequently took plae in connexion with the burial of the dead. Lord BROUGEIAM thought, with the noble and learned lord ( Wensleydale), that there must in this case have been a misconception of the terms of the canon, and he trusted that means would be taken to prevent the deplorable scenes that nowt took place, and to put matterson a fair and equitable and consisRtent basis. The Earl of PORTSMOUTH was of opinion that the aggressive policy of the right rev, prelate to whom the petition referred rather tended to bring discredit upon the church than to confer benefit upon it. The Bishop of SALISBURY said he believed his right rev, brother had made no requirement which was not acknowledged by the committee whikh sat hat year to be reasonable. After a few words in reply from Earl FoTRscus the petition was ordered to lie on the table. INDIAN POLICE. The Marquis of CLANRICARDE rose to move for certain papers relating to the police system and the adminis. tration of criminal justice in Bengal. The first paper was an important document, written by the LieutenantGovernor of Bengal, Mr. Halliday, as far back as April, 1856. The purport of that paper was known in Calcutta very soon after its official presentation, and waa known in this counatry last autumn. The East India Directors had, nevertheless, in FebruAry last, upon the back of a return, declared that they had no cognizance of such a letter. Whether the statement were strictly or only literally true it was equally disgraceful to the East India Directors, who had been wanting in their duty if they had not made them. selves acquainted with an important docment which was known to many people in this country. The other paper which he intended to move for was a despatch written by the East India Directors in September last to the Governor. General, in which the question of police and the administration of crimina justice were ably treated of. That paper had already been laid before the other House, and he presumed there would be no objection to itb production in their lordhipsb lHouse. The administration of ustice in India was no new subject. When the Earl of Ellenborough was Governor-Generalhe pointed out to his Couacil the neoessity for taking immediate stepeto put it upon a more satifactoryfootig, and hemade avariety of suggestions for the improvement of the polie. From that time to the present the subject had repeatedly been brought under the notice of the authorities. There had been petitions from natives, fromlEuropeans, from all classes in ttudia, and now a t last out came this pa per from the India-hiuse. It contained sJeveral admirable recommendations; lut, instead of ending byinstructingthe Governor-General ,to carry those recommendations into effect, it merely desired him to take the subject into earnest consideration and, after communicatingwith the other Presidenciee, to report to the Court of Directors his opinion as to the expediency of a reorganizaton of the police throughout India. That was a perfect mockery in the way of reform. The President of the Board of Control stated the other evening in the House of Commons that the thme for inquir had passed, and the time for action arrved Why, then. did tne rghtl hon, gentleman not act if the CVurt of Directors declined to do so? Why were the latter allowed to interfere on all occaions and prevent the adoption of mach needed reforms? He might be told that something had been done to improve the criminal jurisdiction in India. Tbere was, indeed, a Billnow beforethe LegislativeCouncil baving for its object the enactment of a criminal code for the whole of our possessions in Asia; but that measure, so far from giving content to any class in India, had excited the most profound dissatisfction alike among natives and European He held in his hand official authority for that statement. The Iegislatilve Council, which sat as a Parliament to discuss measures that were brought before it had an authorized report of its debates, and he held in his land an Indian paper, part of which, in the style of some foreign journals, was headed "Official." Under that titlehe found a report of a debate upon the Bil for the oodification of the critminal law. Sir Arthur Buller was represented as saying that the Bil had excited the greatest alarm among the Europeans, who were indignant at its beingnropd to place them under the Company's courts; that their dinatis- action wa justified by the diegraoeful state of the courts in question; and that he intended to propoee the exem tion of the Europeat,p from the operation of the Bill until the courts were refo,moed. The Chief Justice endeavoured to combat the arvumetg of Sir Arthur Buller, but-be practi. cally came to tQ'same conclusion-that it would be monstrous to subj&tlbe Europeans to the jorisdictioai of the Cmpany's cotu In. thei present state. What ha stil The chief* ¢lt lay in t te e reonpel oof tehrens cuts iUI theinjFg*iere men without legal qualification. He did not w*~t se that tberqe never was a judge of high character and attainments in any of the Company's courts, Snch & hippy accident had happened more than once. But, on the whole, the Company's courts, from the highegttothe lowest were not so constituted that any one could hara confidenoe in them. As a proof, it was only necesary ts say that out of 332 persons convicted in seionl courts. presided over by two of the Companuys judges, 148 were acquitted on appeaL The Bill now be fore the Legislative Council ws, in fact, a Bill for esablishing an improved code of procedure, and to that extent, Itwas an excellent measure. But they could not make a good i court without a good judge. It was not the code of laws, but the administrationof that code, 'which afforded atisfac tion. The code administered with so much honour and dignityby his noble and leaned friend the Lord Chietf J- tice oE the Queen's Bench 'would not give stisfcion if it were administered by the Commisioners of Inland Revenue. When it was stted by a judge in India, who was as amiable, just, and honourable a man as ever lived, that his feUow-judge refused to concur in an order because it 'would be disagreeable to the Govern. 3nerit-'when, upon the same authority, it was stated that a judRe of the Supreme Court had been tructed intheviews of ihe Government npon a case 'which 'was about to be submitted to the Court-when it 'was notorious that oorruption prevailed, it ws no wonder that Europen would not go oefore those tribunals, and it became the duty of the British Parliament to interfere. After poohlpoohing the grievance for 25 years, the Government had remitted a Bill fora new cousso of procedure to the Legislative Council of India. But the Legislative Council ought not to supersede the British Parliament, and he asked for a copy of the instutions sent by the Government, in order to see whetber the Goverament had empowered the Legislative Council to pass some Bill or imposed upon them the necessity of adopting a particular code. llherm were two obetacles to; any real reform of the courts of India. The first aud Principal obstcle was the mionopoly of the civil servioe. and the second was the condition of Indian finance, Upon the question of tho close ciil servioe he would refer to two cases. In the Indian News there appeared this pasgraph:- " Considerable disstisfaction has arisen among the memberx of the civil servioe in oDnsequence of the reported elevation of Mr. Raikes to the Suddar Court, he never having been a judge, and havi4g served several -ean in the Ponjb, which is a non-regulation province n The officers who administered jice in%te non-regulatHon provinces were not guided by any code at, all, but oUly V equity and good conscience, and it was stated on high authority that justice was best administered in the nonregulation provinces. There were no Company's oourts, no corrupt officials, none of the machinery of the Company's conrts, and, consequently, none of the chicanery which distinguished them. Ir. Likes might be the most lerned mxan in India, but the civil servata were disatisfied with his appointment because he had served several years in the Paunab, which was a non-regulation provinc (Hear.) He might refer to a stil stronger case, that of Mr. Brown, who was a commissioner in a district not far from the Santhal country, and 'who he (the Marquis of Clanricarde), had heard had been hardly treated. That gentleman lid been discharged from his office on the ground of the "injudicious character of his measures, the misapprehension of law end pacticoe exhibited in his investigations and oor- respondence, the indications of a disturbed and unbalanced I state of mind, and the absence of all self-possession." It was stated that Mfr. Brown had been 20 ears a commissioner, and if the account of him which had been just quoted were true, he could not have been studying law in that period; wet, would the Housa beleve that a recommendation had been sent out by the Court of Directors that the very mau who had been degraded from his functions for the resons which he (the Marquis of Clanricarde) had related to their lordships should be employed again? Nor was that alL. The gentleman in question had actualy been told that he might iok forwud, if he wished it, to the appointment of a eivil and essions judge on a vacancy occurring; so that eventually their lordahipe might find the map who had been declared to be so incompetent as to justify his removal from a former offioo which he had held for 20 year, presiding in a judicialcapacity over the lives and property of his Asiatic fellow subjects. (Hesr, hear.) There was another case he would mention, and in referenoe to which he should expect to hear some explanation. A high judicial office having become vacant, it was offered by the LientensantGovernor, Mr. Halliday, to Mr. Riley, a aver of long standing, and the most emment man at the Calcutta bar; but he was not a civil servant, and after he was appointed by the iUeutenant-Governor Lord Dalhousie did not dare to ratify that appointment. The result was that another person 'was appointed; but objection was taken to him on the score of incompetency. In reply to that objection it was asked who among the civil servants would be found better qualified; and that gentleman, a civil servant, in spite of that protest against him on the ground of incompetenoy, was put into the position of a judge, to deal 'with the lives andpropertyofthe population, although a muchfitter man, hut one not in the cinil service, had been previously appointed to the offioe. (Hear, bear.) Would such a proceeding be tolerated in this country by the British Parliament for a single moment ? Would it be tolerated in the smallest of our colonies? But it was said that In the present tate of the finances of India the Government oould not afford the necessary expense that would be incident to a change of the existingsystem. To withhold money for carrying out so essential ans object as that 'was the worst possible economy. To 'what other means were they to look for a restoration of the finances of India if it was not to the establishment of an effective system of administering the lawr all over the country ? They could not increae the taxation in that part of the British dominions; that had been acknowledged over and over again. On 'what condition, then, could we retain and perpetuate our dominion there ? It could only be by encouraging and fostering British enterprie and skll, arnd stimiulating the empiloyment of British capitalin that direction, so that their united influence might permeate tbrough all the institutions of the country, and call forth all its vared resources. But at present they 'were deterring Europeans from going there, and it 'was only to them that they could look for any rational prospect for developing the capasbilities of the country. aI terefore implored their lordships to take those things into their consideration. At present they had every class in India against them. He defied them to point to any class in a worse condition than the peantry. The people, indeed, were in tbe lowest state of poverty; the existinz tenure of land ground them down, and the police system oppressed them; and their lordships might beassured that mnen would not embark their money, their enterprise, and their energy in a country 'where they knew they would be robbed and plundered 'with impunity so long as those iniquitous courts continued to bold saway over the population. The noble marquis concluded by moving for a copy of the minute (dated April, 186) of Mr. Halliday, Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, upon the state and administration of criminal justioe in that presidency; and for copies of the correpondence between the Directors of the East India Company and the GovernorGeneral of India respecting the introduction to the Legilative Council of the Bills for the improvement of the lawr ha India now under consideration. The Duke of ARGYLL said that the speech of his noble friend 'was very much a repetition of that 'which he had addressed to a former Parliament about two months and a half ago, and upon that occasion it had fallen to his lot to endeavour to showr to their lordships that wrhatever ground there might be for complaint upon matters of detail as regarded the state of the judicil establishments, of the police, and of those other matters connectewidth the internal administration, his noble friend had not made out any case against them. He would not on the present oocasion go over the same ground again, but he 'would endeavour to notico shortly some of the points to which his noble friend had alluded. It was certinly true that the minute of Mr. Halliday of the 6th of A pril, 1856, 'was not ;et in the official possession of the Government, but that fact oould not support any accusation of carelessness or indifference against the Court of Directors If any such charge could be brought, andhe denied that any could fairly be brought, it would be against the Government in India; but he did not think that his noble friend 'would believe that Lord Canning or the Legisltive CouncU of India had any particular object in withholding that document. The facts of the case bry 'within a small compass Shortly after the appeaance of Mr. Halliday's minute a petitionhad beengotup bythemissionaries in Bengal, founded both upon the statements contained in that minute and upon their own knowledge, praying the Government to issue a speial commission to inquire into certain grievances 'which they alleged to extst in BengaL The Government of India thus called upon to form a decision immediately eame to the concludon that it would be extremely imprudent and useless to iseue such a coin mission, and a minute was drawn up by Mr. Halliday. another by Lord Canning, and another by another member of the Council, stating the reasons upon 'which that decision had been come to. at minute-thahome Government had been placed inosmono!; butbte previous minuteha not yetbeen placedFin theirposseesion, possibly becau.,e the Indian Government wrere preparing to act uoon it, and it would not be possible to legislate upon it at home. Then, *gin, hssnobsl friend, in reference to thepolic, had quoted rome statements from a despateh with a vow of showigthat the Government were aware of their inefficency, and he had also iAsinuated thbat there 'was a contradiction betreEn the language of the despatch and that which had been used in another place by the President of the Board of Control. As to the efflcienoy of the police, he believed-that he had said enough upon that subject on a former occssion; and as to the appWrnt contradiction, 'what was the real state of the case ? hy, the paragraph from the despatch dwelt upon the expedienoe of inquizy, and Mr. Vernon Smith had stated that the present was not the time for inquiry, but for action; but his noble friend had over. looked the fact that the inquiry and the action referred to two entirely different questions. His noble friend must be aware that the question of polio, was a very large question, and one vwith reBgrd to which many differ ent opinions existed. It was thought by many person that the police forco of India should have a military organiza tion which should extend over the whole of Inda and therefore the reason ws obvious why the Government at kome should have dircted the Indian Government to in. quire into the subjoct and consult the authorities in the dif. ferent preidencies upon the subject. His noble f4end bad referred to a statement made by hipptpon a previous oocsion to the effect that'-measures wire under the onaidera ton of the supreme Government with referenoe to the Judicial system, the polie, and the law- relatin to landlord and tenant, and had expressed his belef that hefhabeen mstaken in that statement. Now, he would tel their lordships the authority upon which he ha spoken. in a minute of Mr.' HsdaY,. of Septomber 1856, it. was' stated that the .qu6stions"f' the ' polioe and of I the judiil system were under the onsideration of the Governmht, and niaores rling to those subjects would in aU ptobabUity beyreses,tedto thegIadj5tue * .n In a subeequent riinnatb ovenorGenera, Eated t with regardto the-imprerltofhopie andj ldlte, matters irerlpe for ctiD; tbOali.idJreton of lndlord and tenant. wa not aware whether those bills had been since introduced, but be thought that be was jusdfit4 I ttDB t mveauxeq wgzg hbg propaod by the Govermmenst.

Now, for his own purt, he coold not toke blame to the Government for thius acting, beoue it appeared ohim that thA oue as wie and pmideteoe. The ls hl h fie said Yh it a clesr that the Indian Government wer aware of tlneueffleoy and corruption of their own eourks becatm, although thb wrished to sabject other Eunope.

If the In"n Gover neat waskorant of theee or sought to oonoeal them, r iht be reason to that no remedy would be proid, bt wrhen it wa that the iAeu enatzGoerendr et engal, a gentleman whowas examinbeor theeomittee of 1853, and made a. very fsvourableimpresion upon thirlordahipe hear lenr) was giving hia serioux atention to the enls wh}ch a the people of that province, and had sent home a minut stating that he was about to recommend to the eon. sideration of the LgislAtive Council meamsur for their amelioration, he (the Duke of A&rgy) 4ould not say that he saw any ground for fearing tt these evils would remainundealtwith. Wlth thevariousinstanoe mentioned bthe noble marquis he wa, of course, nab to de4, hxn had no notice of them; but he certainly coulId not undersnd tiat mark of his noble friand that . the evils of the iudici em Inaare from the clW neas of the civil servioe. One of the results of the daliberstion of Parliament in 185 wa the declation that te appointmants in the civil service should be thrown onen w competition, andthatprovi,on bsd ereranoebeen fait'Ifu ad npn. He did not know whether the noble marqus 'wished to see English lwyers dotted all over the idial E5mpiro; but, if ie did, the introdmUce of such a system would gr incea the expenses of the Government. No doibt it was the duty of both the Iian and the British Governments to sqe that justioe as dily Adliniestred in Indi: but hemnugt remind their lordships that in Engkland a great pat of t#e caiminal jurisdiction ws exercised by magistrates who h nlo speial legal educatioii, ad Whatever reforms night be introduced the same state of thinq must to a great extent vailinlndia. Withtheexceptonoftheminute of Mr. Halliday, of which the Government were not officiayp ed, there WAs no objection to the production of the papers for which the noble marquis had moved. Lord MONTE&G0E said that if he were AS hopeflaAs the noble duke he should have no objection to follow his advice and to wAit for the removal of the evils of which his noble friend had oomplained. un. fortunately, however, that was the advice which had alwaysbeen given in reprda to Jnd n ffi*, And our wait. lug h;A alwarj ended mn disppointment. The intentions of Parliment, as expressed in the chatr of both-I833 and 853, had been repeatedly and flagrantly violated. The charter of 1833 provided that for every vacancy in thre civil service there sheuld be four candidates, of wibO, he e deserving should be selected for appointment. Thatlaw wa violated by the East India Company, and the old e- tam of patronage was steadily peaevered in. The =harr of I853 opened the civil service, so far as an Act of -1arlia. ment oould effect that, and abolished the disinion between woveuanted and uncovenanted servnts. In th eas of Mr. Riley, however, to whicb his noble friend ha referred, there was an undue and unjust preference of a covenanted servnt, wlho had actuully previouily - heeiL declared to be incmpetent for the office to which he -s appointed. Further than thi, during the discuaslondE the Act of 183 there was laid upon the table a remrkablT minute, supposed to have been framed by Mr. ncly, which laid dowua very enlarged system of legal educatios According to this plan young men going out to India were to spend two years in Egland, during which time they were to attendand prre report of the proceedings in our courts of jushte, especally before the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council, and were otherwise to preparethemselves for thedischarge of their judicial duties. Thatminute-for which, at the time, the Government took great credit-lhid been trampled under foot with the same uncnoern, with the same danDg disregad of engagements entered into as bad been exhibited towards the chaters of 1833 and 1853. If there Wes one reform More than another in the expediency of which all the witnese were agreed, to which tbe Government had pledged itelf, and which Parliament hd unequivocally sanctioned, it was the amalgamation of the Suddar courts with the Supreme Courts of India& This reform had been under consideration sinoe the year 1829, andhadbeenregarded with favour, by some of, our most, distinguished Indian statesmen. Mr. allidqy told the committee of 1853 that is would be highly advantageous to the whole administration of justice in Indiu, and he wax corroborated by Sir E Ryan and otherwitnesses of great authority. Nay, more than ths, the President of the Board of Control (Sir C. Wood) stated in the House of Commons that it was the intention of the Government to propose the consolidation of the two courts, from which measure he anticipated the most beneficial effects; but he also stated that a commission would be appointed to draw up a code of procedure, and that until the reportof that commision had een appointed the propoal would be uspended.- That. commi=on was appointed; on it were-Sir John RoBny, Chief Justice Jervis, Sir Edward Ryan, and other gentlemen of great distinction; its report had been presented, but not one step had yet boen taken by the Government to carry its pledge into effect. After the battledore and shuttlecock game through which Mr. 3aculay's code had gone-to and from India, it. was no wonder that the references to India should have been looked on with suspicion. The late Lord Chief Justice Jervis, seeing the manner in which the Government were disposed to play with the quetion, when called upon to sdgn. tho tbird and fourth reports, refused to sign it. " I coneUd to act on the Commision of Indian I&w Reform,"' he said in justifyng his refusal "on the expres under. standing that we were to endeavour to frame a code for All India. With that underutanding I applied myselt to the duty, but if I had supposed that the commission wouli be used to postpone legislation, that the subject would ulti. mately have been referred to India, I should not have consented to act. Considering that a slight has been cast on the commiseion, I decline to take any further part in the proceodings of the commisdon."' This was a question that required the decision of the home Legilature. The supreme Court of India wa createdL by staute, and by statute alone oould the evils complained of be remedied. He held in his hand a petition signed by natives of the highest eminence and respectability in Calcutta, in which they prayed for an infusion of the influence: of the Quen's judges to giade and controlthejudges ap_ ponte ythe East lndia Company. This was not supi. g after what had been laid down in the report of Mr. Haliday, and he felt bound to sav that had we opened our eyes sooner to the great evils that existed a remedy might, ere now have been provided. Hewouldnot nowput any distinct questions to the Government, for he wanted a dii. tinDt answer, which he hoped to reoeive on somcw futnre occasion but he wnted to know what steps wrere likely to be taken wilth respect to t'e improvement in the administration of the laW sought. for by his native petitioners, ad when it was intended to carryInto practicethe profesionsthat had beea so liberally msade. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of I;BElWARLE had three very importantpetitions to present from European and native inhabitants of the province of Bengal, all relating to the subject which bis noble friend had brought under the consideration of the House; but the question was one of such vast importance that he felt it impossible to do jOstaietothcase of the, petitioners now. He w ld, therefore, that they were soon to have another debate on the subject of India. During this sesion he had been very chary of bringing forward Indian grievanoes, but he must say that regard the question of India from what side he liked it was one that almost filled him with. despair. (Hear.) He ws glad to have the present Lieatenant-General of Bengal as e coadjutor in this work. One short sentncein his report d produoed the greatest effect on his mind. He said" the strong prey universaly on the weak." Their lordships were All famUiir with the spectacle of a drop of dirtywter as seen through the nedium of the microecope. 'he animals brought to light were very smalL but they were preying on eah other, the strong niverally pre,ing on the wek Thlis wz An epitome of the Goverment of India, while the Government. at home looked on and did nothing. (Hear.) After A few words from the Marquis of C1 IA:RcAD3 The motion in its amended form ws agreed to. TRANSPORTATION AND PENTAL SgaRVrUDE BILL. The report of amendments upon this Billwas brought up Tnd grdeed to. Their lordehips adjommned at 8 o'clock.

ZONDOR, 2UBSDAY, JUNE 16,1857. - In the House of Lords last night, ThePrincessRoyal's Annuity Billwas read a thlrd -time and passed. Lord CLANKRICARDE moved for certain returns ,connected with the police system and administratioa of criminal justice in Bengal After some discussion the returns were agreed to, with certain amendments. The report of amendments on the Transportation and Penal Servitude Bil was brought up and agreed to. Their Lordships then adjourned. The House of Commons having resolved itself into a Committee upon the Oaths Bill, to substitute one oath for the oathis of allegiance, Bupremacy, and abjuration, Mr. DEASY, upon the first clause,-which included a declaration " that no foreign prince, person, prelate, State, or potentate hath or ought to have any juri,diction, power, superiority, pre-emimence, or authority, ecclesiastical or spiritual, directly or indirectly, within this realm,"-moved to substitute for " ecclesiastical or spiritual" the words " temporal or civil." His object, he said, as the principle of the Bill was to abolish aU distinctions founded upon 1eligious opiijious, was that the oath to be taken by the Roniani Catholic subjects of HER MaJESTY should be the same as that taken by other subjects; in Bhort, that all members of the Legislature should be placed llpon the same footing, and that their allegiance should be tried by one uniform test. Lord PALAuRsToN agreed with Mr. DEAsY that it would be desirable, if it were practicable, that there should be but one oath (though he thought there was nothing in the Roman Catholic oath which could do violence to the feelings of any man), but the House was caled upon to determine whether it should free this oath from words that were superfluous and repugnant to the common sense of Protestants, and he submitted to Mr. DEAsy that a perseverance in his attempt would fail to accomplish the purpose he had in view, for if he succeeded in altering the oath as he proposed the change would entail the ultimate failure of the measure under dis.cussion. Upon a division, the amendment was negatived by 373 to 83. The committee again divided upon an amendment moved by Mr. RoEBuCK, to insert after the word " spirituar' the words "by law," which was negatived by 2t3 to 68. Sir F. TIESI(oER then moved the amendment of which he had given notice, to add at the end of the oath, after the word "realm," the words " and I do make this promise, renunciation, abjuration, and declaration, heartily, willingly, and truly, on the true faith of a Christian." He argued that these words were essential; that they preserved the Christian character of Parliament, which had subsisted to the present time; that tho onus was upon the advocates of the right of Jews to a seat in that House to show that right, whereas they had never, he said, approached the vital Part of the question. They must, he contended, maintain either that it was a mistake to suppose that the House had a Christian character, or that the time had arrived when it was no longer necessary to retain that character. He maintaiued, on the contrary, that itwas impossible to abandon that bulwark of our constitution-the Christian character of the Legislature of this country. The amendment was supported by Mr. STwoPE, Mr. WioRAM, wad Mr. WARRN, and opposed by Mr. KiNGxAr.z and Mr. EVANS. Sir J. PArQGToN said that hitherto he had. given a silent vote in favour of the principle embodied in the amendment; but having reflected more anxiously Upon the subject, the result, he was bound to say, was thathe could not conscientiously continue tovote for the exclusion of Jews. He thought it would be desirable, however, to retain in the oath the words "4 on the true faith of a Christian," and he was sorry that the Government had decided to change the shape of the oath in that respect. It would have been a better course, in his opinion, to alow Christians to take the oath with the solemn conclusion to which they had been so long accustomed, and to effect the emancipation of the Jews by a Bill similar to that by which Roman Catholics were emancipated, going directly to the object. Bat the Government having decided upon another coirse, as he had made up his mind that he was no longer at liberty conscientiously to resist the ad mission of Jews to Parliament, it only remained for him to support that course. Sir JoHN then proceeded to argue in favour of the admission of Jews, denying that it would, as alleged, unchristiauize that Rouse, which, in the sense used by the opponents of their admission, was unchristianized already. The addition of some few Jews could not, he said, deprive the House of the character of being, in the best and wisest sense, a Christian assembly. The amendment was likewise opposed by Mr. Hons3rzA, and supported by Mr. <AP& n and by Mr. WITEsiDE, the latter in a speech of much energy, which called up Lord J. RUSSELL, who said Mr. WHiTESiDE had placed the question in such a position that, although he had not intended to address the House, he was so anxious for the success of the Bill that he could not refrain from replying to some parts of his speech, which he accused of intolerance, and of recommending for imitation examples which he trusted the House would be slow to follow. After some observations from Mr. NEwDEcATE In favour of the amendment, Lord PALMXRSTON, having first complimented Sir J.PAIUNGTON upon the frank avowal of his change of opinion, replied to the objections offered to the proposed form of the oath, observing that that House was not a religious, but a political assembly, and that it was not entitled to inquire into the religious opinions of its members, except so far as they may tend to inf5uence and sway their political conduct. Upon a division the amendment was negatived by 341 to 201. On the question that the clause stand part of the Bill, Mr. WAIPOLE inquired whether the Bill was to stand as it was drawn; because, if so, Jews and Roman Catholics were put upon a different footing. He asked whether the clause in Lord J. Russer's Bill, restraining Jews from holding offices which Roman Catholics could not hold, would be inserted in this Bill? Lord PAT.bERSTON replied that Hin ATWsy's Government had no intention of making any alteration in the Bill as it then stood. Lord R. CECIL moved that the CHTArAx report progress; but this motion was negatived upon a division. Mr. B=,iTINcs asked for a distinct answer to the question whether it was the intention of the Government that the Jews should be eligible to the offices of Lord Chancellor and Prime Minister ? Lord PALMESTON replied that the Bill was not a Bil of disqualification, and therefore, as it atood, it would not prevent Jews from holding those appoint. meats. If any members wished to raise a discussion upon this point, he should have no objection to the CHAIRMrAS'S reporting progress after the first clause was agreed to. The first clause having passed, a further unsuccessful attempt was made to report progress, and, after some discussion, the other clauses of the Bill were agreed to. The Sound Dues Bill, the County Cess (Ireland) Bill, and the Militia (Ireland) Act Amendment Bill were read a third time and passed. Other Bills were advanced a stage. Some further business having been disposed of, the House adjourned at half-past 1 o'clock.
If there is one tendency moro obvious than another in the British Legislature, it is to have as little as possible to .do with controversial qae6tions. It is becoming more and more a civil Legislature, interfering in religion only when compelled, when dealing with existing institutions, or having to dispose of some political question complicated with religious opinions or pretensions. The Roman Catholics have chiefly contributed to this existing and increasing tendency of the Legislature. Before the famous Act of 1829 the British Parliament had a very theological, dogmatical, anti-Papal character. It held that Popery was so great an error, and so injurioua to head, heart, and soul, that it could not even allow 9ne Papist to take part in its deliberations. Those were serious days, when men were in earnest, and when, if the Roman Catholics found no Parliamentary countenance for their peculiar doctrines, they had at least its countenance for earnestness, bigotry, and even persecution. But when O'CoNNErL had laid siege to Parliament for several years, and when all Ireland was st its gates, -wit alU spta of mysteriouis threat;a it. capitu'lated, and then followed that .5pecies of CONCOtDAT Which survives to this day. But the change has been almost fatal to the religious character of the two HouEes; not that the members are less religious than they were, for they are probably more religious, but Parliament is no longer that Synod of Protestant Divines that it used to be. The man who is on his legs discussing Bishops, Deans and Chapters, qthes, Universities, Church Rates, Ministers' Money, and all kinds of semi-religious questions, -may be either a Protestant or a Papist, and his arguments are such as either may use. We have to thank our Roman Catholic fellow-subjects for this change; and if they are in some respects benefited by it, or if they find themselves better off in a liberal than in a bigoted, though heterodox assembly, on the other hand, they will now find all questions dealt with mainly on what thAy may please to consider low political grounds. It so happens just now that the Jews are in the same position that the Roman Catholics were in 1829, the City of London perseveringly returning Baron RoTnsCHmD, just as the County of Clare was then returning Mr. O'CoxNXLL. The only difference is in favour of the City of London, which is certainly acting with less violence and returning abetter and quieter citizen than Clare did. The House of Commons respects the importinity of the Londoners, as it did before that of the Irish Papists, and is for allowing Baron ROTHSCnILD at last to sit and vote. That was ]ast night the simple question before the House. The Roman Catholics had supplied the precedent,and could have nothing to say against it. Least of all could they pretend that the House of Commons ought to insist on its generally Christian character, general Christianity being in their eyes worse than any particular error. They could not, then, consistently and reasonably offer any objection to the Bill, or couple it with other demands in their own favour. The Emancipation Act was confined to tho case of the Roman Catholics themselves, who wouild then have been very indignant to bo classed with the Jews, or included in the benefit of the same measure. This political view of the present question, for wh,ch, we repeat, we have to thank the Roman Catholics, has in the present instance been fatal to the demand which they have endeavoured to engraft upon the admission of the Jews. Parliament still thinks it right to maintain its political protest against the dominion or jurisdiction of any foreign prelate in this country. It has this difficulty to meet in the case of the Roman Catholics, but not in the case of the Jews, who have no foreign or extranational organization, and no spiritual prince claiming the allegiance of all mankind. The question is, " Are the Jews good subjects and safe " legislators ?' It is the question which was asked of the Roman Catholics 30 years ago, and then' finally answered in the affirmative, though the jealousy of some of us stipulated for what was called a security. The House of Commons now confines itself to settling that one question. It decides, on grounds of notorious fact and common sense, that the Jews may be safely trusted to legislate for the country. For our part, as a matter of feeling, we should have thought it quite enough for the Roman Catholics to find the Jews following their example, and entering Parliament by the gap themselves had made. Even that might suggest unpleasant comparisons. But the last thing we should have desired for ourselves was that which the Roman Catholics have now asked, with their uualwroftheadeduess,;-that they shaU be relieved contemporaneously with the Jews in the same measure, and relieved, not from exclusion, but from an oath which they nevertheless now take without any hesitation, and are able to interpret to at least their own. entire satisfaction. This ill-advised attempt has not succeeded, and the only result is to publish to the world, which had almost forgotten it, that the Roman Catholics regularly take an oath to which they have a particular objection. The purely political view of the case is a matter of necessity. Whether it be expedieit or not to admit the Jews into Parliament, that expediency is the only rule we can now adopt; and we have accordingly to consider what good or harm the Jews are doing now, and what they will be likely to do in Parliament. This is a question which few people will decide on the generalities of Sir F. TH1ESTGEn as to the unnational, inulated, cosmopolitan character of the Jews. That is the natural result of their exclusion from civil privileges. If we prevented a particular class from entering our cities or even dwelling in houses, they would be obliged to live in tents and wander over the country; but it would be the height of malice to argue then, from their outdoor, wandering habits, against allowing them to enter our towns. No doubt, if we give up our jealousy of the Jews, they will lose much of that distinctiveness which exists nowhere so strongly as in this country. It is for theJews themselves to consider whether they would prefer to be assimilated, to acquire the same habits and ways of thinking, to lay themselves under the same conventional obligations, and have the same stake as other people in society. The effects of such a process are a matter of speculation. At present the Jews are permitted to do little else than get and save money. Suppose their insulation removed,-suppose them becoming undistinguishable members of general society,-how long will they retain their special habits t Even if they retain for a while their money-making tastes, may they not some day lose the strong grasp with which they inow hold a mass of wealth vastly out of proportion to their numbers ? These are questions for themselves -to consider, and we are strongly of opinion that they do well to reject all such considerations, and demand to be 'Englishmen and British subjects, in the full political sense of the words. We are equally sure that it is a mistake on the part of Christians to insist on harassing the Jews with exclusion, and goading them to obstinacy. It is evident that the House of Commons is wearied and disgusted with this unworthy task, and wiU at last throw on others the responsibility of persecution. Sir J. PAxroroi last night avowed that he could resist the Jewish claims no longer, and the Ministerial majority, almost double that which has usually been obtained for the measure, leaves- no doubt as to the intention of the House, and the certainty of the Bill being pressed till it becomes law. The Lords, however, must soon decline the invidious task thrust upon them by zealots who think so meanly of their faith and so greatly of its foes as to fear the presence of one Jew among 656 Christian legislators.
In a free country and with a free press the two sides which every question is said to possees are pretty sure to be found out, and so we do not take it amiss that the views we expressed last week upon the subject of Chelsea Hospital have called forth an adveree opinion. ThD oppcsition, however, is not vely strongly grounded. AU that can be said against the principle of 3Daking every pension an out-pension. and tbas rendering the institution at Chelsea available for other purposes most intimately connectel1 with the relief of the army, seems embod'ced in an objection or two of no very seriods weight. It is argued that no out-pension coaIld compensate for the manifold advantages accruing from a residence within the establishment; that the costiimeof the Hospital confers an enviable distinction; that the discipliue ulain. tained there-is irksome only to the wrongly disposed, Who, by this -very evidence, need it all the more ; that pensioners left to themselves would fall into bad hands -and worse habits; and; finally, that the country would be deprived of a national insti tution representing at once its own grateful sentiments and the military merits of its sons. By way of putting the whole of this came in a clear and popular light, and returning to the subject not merely as a newspaper controversy, but a great public question, we ask our readers to follovr us through a few figures, taken from the Army Estimates of the present year. It is surprising how many points of the discussion they wiU be found to elucidate. The principle at the founda, tion of the whole argument implies, of course, that every soldier who has devoted the days of his strength to the service of his country ought to re ceive an equivalent in the shape of support when those days have gone by. In theory it is from Chelsea that this support in all cases alike is supposed to be forthcoming. All pensioners, whether "in" or "out" pensioners, are described as " of Chelsea Hospital;" the former class being maintained entirely within the walls of that establishment, and the latter being provided with certain pensions, to be applied to their own maintenance at their own discretion. The exact number of pensioners given in the accounts above-mentioned is 61,370, of whom 538 were supported inside the Hospital, and 60,832 received their allowances outside. These allowances vary in amount, and are of course not intended in all cases to be tantamount to entire support. The maintenance of the 538, as represented in the total cost of Chelsea Hospital, was 25,6511.; the pensions of the 60,832, including the expenses of payment, superintendence, &c., were set at 1,135,6871. Taking round numbers it will appear, we think, that the average outlay upon an in-pensioner is about 50l. a-year, and upon an out-pensioner about 191. ; so that the cost in the former case approaches to three times that in the latter. A very good appreciation can now be formed of the objections advanced against our opinions on this subject. To begin with, it is perfectly clear that, if a residence in a national establishment does really convey the advantages ascribed to it, the vast majority of deserving pensioners are deprived of these peculiar benefits, which appear limited, indeed, to less than one-hundredth part of the whole body. If a pensioner cannot be properly treated outside a hospital 99 hundredths of the class are treated improperly, and 50 more Chelsea Hospitals at least should be instituted without delay. If a hospital and a staff of officers are necessary to prevent the 5o0 iinmates from coming to harm, what becomes of the 60,000 who are under no such superintendence ? In what light are we to regard these 500 ? Are they selected as deservmng a larger outlay, or as needing more vigilant attention? Certainly it must be rather difficult to prove that a principle which is actually applied to more than 60,000 cases out of 61,000 is likely to ocoasion any material injury when applied to the remainder. Next, take the interests and wishes of the pensioners themselves. Chelsea Hospital, no doubt, costs a good deal of money, but to assume that the provision made for those under its roof is so ample as really not to admit of representation or equivalent in money payraents appears to be an extravagant kind of estimate. Can it be seriously alleged that the actual cost of a pensioner in the *Hospital -viz., some 501. a-year, would not be sufficient to maintain him in all the comfort he could possibly require ? Why, there are hiundreds of parishes in the kingdom in which he would be a richer man than the clergyman. If any Costume or badge were thought conducive to his dignity or happiness he might be entitled to the distinetion in one locality as well as another, and it would be all the more effective in a village where none perhaps could show it but himself. Look, again, at another side of the question. There are few pensioners without some relations or friends among whom they would wish to live, and, even in the rare cases ,where such connexions might be wanting, the scenes of youth or childhood almost invariably exercise an attractive influence upon advancing age. From these attractions the inpensioner is excluded, and we doubt whether many instances could be found in which much compensation would be drawn from the associations surrounding the Hospital itself. Attachments of this kind might certainly be generated by time and habit, especially in the absence of other and more natural ties, but if the option were given at the outset between a residence in the national establishment and an equivalent provision with entire personal independence, we believe the latter would be invariably preferred. The plain truth of this matter is, as we observed before, that Chelsea HIospital represents the views and practices of generations long past. In old days every establishment for the support of the poor or the deserving took the form of a ponderous and permanent institution, well calculated, no doubt, for duration and efficiency, but absorbing material enough for a dozen such purposes. To maintain half a score of bedesmen it was thought necessary to provide a house or a " hospital," with' its warden and its porters, its officials and its statutes, and endowments enough, as property improved, to keep a whole parish in indolence. In those days the system was good, and probably indispensable; but the necessities in question exist no longer. All that is needed is to do in all cases what is already done in all but very few-viz., to supply such a pension as the case requires, and to leave the application of the annuity to the taste of the recipient himself. We are quite aware that an establishment like that at Chelsea provides, in its higher offices, very desirable posts for the reward of merit in superior grades of the service. The hospital, for instance, numbers among its officials a Governor, a Lieutenant-Governor, a Major, an Adjutant, and a Quartermaster, and each of these functionaries may be assumed to represent some officer who has worthily borne HnER MJAEZsVS commission. But the argument in this case is simply a repetition of that in the otker. If such places afford,- as they: probably do, the means of recompensng 3militauy: deserti, those means canbe provided just as.well. without the. apparatus of an institution or even the drawuhck of duty. The salaries of all taken together are bat some 1,60a. -year. Win must have said enougbs we think, upon the comparative conveniences of in-pensions ancd outpensions, and the readw vill hardly have failed to observe that we have been looking at the case throughout on its own. merits alone. We have not said a word about tb.e advantages derivable from the' Chelsea instittxkuon under another form, nor have we, in eons*puting the cost of the Hospital, taken any account of the building or the site. Our views, in fact, are entirely independent of 'ihese considerations; nor have they been affecteCi by any characteristics of management or cost at'saehing to this particular establishment. We have. no doubt that 500 or 600 pensioners are maints;ned at Chelsea as well, and perhaps, for that moatter, as cheaply, as they could be me.mtaiiaied at any institution of the kind, but -we do not believe that such institutions are neceeaAry for the purposes they were designed to serve. We think such maohinery can now be dispensed with, nIot only wi*.qut injIry tX my one, but with gain to all, and our readers, we trust, will feel dipowd to - admit that we have shown good groundz for our opinion.
What pleasant thoughts it inspires in some eecluded family when the intelligence suddenly reaches home that the scapegrace son and brother has made his fortune in Australia by delving and digging among auriferous deposit I Dreams of the mnoat fantastic kind immediately pass before the excited imaginations of those who stand nearest and dearest to that charning prodigal, W1ho, to speak the simple truth, had been somewhat ignominiously banished from domestic joys with anything but complimentary prophecies as to his future fortunes and the ultimate conclusion of his eventful career. It is presumed, of course, that nuggets and natural affection go together, and that the first thought of that interesting outcast will be for the dear ones at home. "That nugget will send little BOB "to school; this big fellow will pay the bill for "the repapering and fresh-painting of the paternal " hail, and for, putting the roof in a state of "thorough repair; the smaller parcel of gold"dust will enable Sister NELL to compete on "more equal ternm, as far as drapery is con" cerned, with her flaunting rivals for the pos"session of the village attorney." There is not an aspiration in which any member of the family may have- indulged, from a run up to London to attend the HEuDzL Festival down to a sneaking desire for a, new bonnet, which is not now to be realized because the wandering brother has made, or is reported to have made, a fortune in Australia. Pretty much the same thing is it with our Irish friends When any one from any county or district in their island has made a hit of it inthe political world. " Sure and "he 'won't forget the old times, and he'll "get me a place," says one; another gentleman replies, " Sure and he'll think of the new " times; and he'll get me a place." cDidn't I "vote for him ? and out of gratitude he'll get me "a place." " Didn't I vote against him? and to "show that he bears no spite he'll get me a "place." " Didn't I drive him from BaDybaroo to " Loughporridge? andhe'llgetmeaplace." "Didn't " I take up his honour?s boots when he was stopping ' at the Collbriggan Ar-rums ? and he'll get me a " place." Now, we by no means wish to maintain the proposition that Englih members are not bulied and pestered by their constituents for petty places and petty favours; that assertion would be precisely the reverse of the truth; but what we do say is that the intelligence that our " talented townsman " has been converted into a Junior Lord of the Treasury, or that our distinguished county member has been made Secretary to the Tape and Sealingwax Department in consequence of his political achievements, does not spread the same excitement through an English as through an Irish borough or county. Has not Colonel HERBERT just been made Irish Secretary, and has not the great news flown from hill to hill throughout romantic Kerry-swift as the beacon's flash in the old days, when HoMER was "Our " Own Correspondent," and swifter than the fiery cross, which was passed from hand to band by those sentimental mountaineers wiom Sir WALTER SCOTT invented, and in whom, as boys, we believed ! Colonel HERERaT, who seems to.know his countrymen well, fairly took the bull by the horns the other day,when he ptesented himself before themfor re-election. Just in the same way: that English candidates fairly grapple with the Jewish or the Maynooth difficulty upon such occasions, and endeavour to give utterance to such a confe8idon of faith 8S WiU secure to them the utmost number of votes, at the same time that it ties their hands as little as possible, so did Colonel HERBERT fearlewsly plunge into his own sea of troubles. lVhen we say that he plunged in we perhaps use an inappro priate phrase, for he seems rather to have sidled and shuffled into the surf in a complacent and ladylike manner, with one eye upon the incoming wave and the other upon the bathing-woman. " There is one more questioL to which I wIsh to askhlycr attention. It is rather a delicate one, but I trust to the good-humour, kindness, and good sense of my countrymen to listen to she for a few moments on the subject. I aUlde to the subject of 2atronage. You all know, probably-at all events, you all believe-that in consequence of the ape pointment I have received I heve a considerable amount of what may be called in familiar langgeo, ' the loaves and fishes' Iunder my distribution. " Con. Lamnb (an elector).-Signs by, youzel be trowbwd wih a great deal of applications. (Laughter.) Colonel HerHbrt.-You are quite right. That's what I was coming to. (LAighter.) " Con. Larb.-'Tis the most troublesome situation a man can hold, Godhelp you I (LAughter.) And haf of ten, tat oowuld cut your taroat are bowing and scraping obo pu 7now. (Laughter from the gallery.) You wanta couple of dozen clerks to read and answer your letters. I hpes you will be after making out an easy berth, you iaoi, f*r me no in my old days." (Laughter.) Mr. Cox. LA3B discharges the functions of the chorus in a Greek play. He warns, he adm6nishes, he encourages, he mourns for the people; he expresses their sympathies, their wants, and, certainly, if we may judge by the conelusion of his speeeb, their feelings and their wishes, which are all summed up in a demuand for an easy berth. In the foregoing seldenying declaration Colonel HEiBzrT seems to, bave considered that he had gone too far, so that it had become necessary to right himself with- a little jocularity which mnight mean iauch-something, but not much, or nothing at all,, awcordingly as it was understood by the hearer or the- speaker :- "Colonel Herbert.-So much do I consider mysel6 in debted to the electors of the county, not only for the honour of electing me, but for the landness with which they hare always viewed Any eflorta of mine, and the ferboerance they have exercised towards me, that reolly speak the honest truth when I tell you that, if I eonsulte& my own foeiings, erer'y man in Kcrry wcho wcanted a berth. should 7?ve the vcry bit ptace I could girR him, with the least pos6ibls to do end the largsat possible saar. (Laughter.) " Con. Lamb.-That would just suit my knuckle to. niety." (Laughter.) Having thus openedI his di9iculty generally, Colonel HEPIREaRT prceeded to enbbrg, upon it. The preceding declarafion. might have gone too far upon the side of hlmaniTuty; it will be seen that Cblonel- HERszTz- reco-vered himself, and for the moment was quite the -oman again. . From tha Romax how.erer, he passed rapidly to the- mental conditiol of the mnan of the world, aad' froma that of th, man of the wo.id to one 3nueh betkez. lmderstood and appreeiated ly his andience-that of an Irish patriot prepared to insist upon the iaost favoured nation clause with regard to his, own constituents, in any litile matter of patronage that might fall to his disposal. " Colonel Herbert.-But .1 emlaCed in a public and responsible yositio, in. wich. it is my duty, a3 far I arn able, to cormult the public intertst. I must j'sst ask youto consider that if I am guilty of perpetrating a job I disgrace myself and reflect disgrace on you (hear, heAr), because if a man hoe been without opposition for 10 years your repre. sentaSve it reflects on your choico if it can be fairly said of him, when he comes into an offlcial -psition, that he hbA be guilty of a job. Do owt for a nosnt npose ttat I awn such a fool at to think.lam going to inaugurate averiod of perfect purity, and do not -i.magine that politicn and personal considerations wiU not have vteir weight, Bat I must remind you. that the tendency of pablic opinion has been of late-most properly, in my mind-to put down, as far as it is possible, anything like jobs or unfair patronage. 'Within the last few years a sYstenm has been adopted in Dablin of holding up forcAupetition some of the bestocestoqbe given away by the Secretary. Do not suppose for a moment that I can attempt to put aWide that systenm Stijt, do not ;up' POSe thac it ia not be my Ih, O whneerf ean ieitiaWy, I0 Mofteay one of:m3, fdcowocouaren but-I entret of YOU0memberthat IhavenoI th honrto bo nOt oIlr YOU?rereseentatire, bttthat the whole of frnad km otli6k c3aimse-Upohi min." (Hear, hear.) The oddest part of this strango sooe is that the declaration of purity should have been receivedt with so.much enthusium, while thee vat bulk of the. peIwus present were only witing. tbeir.oppor-.- tunity to press on their newly elocted member each the littlo pet job which "wo4d fit hiI " knuckle to a nicety."

MONY-Af RKErand CITYINTELLIGBEjOZ Monday Evoning. The fands have been firmer to-day, and have closed with a good appearanee at an advance of au eighth per cent. Console for the July account opened at 93& to i ex dividend, and remained without alteration until the afternoon, when, in consequence of some speculative prcases, they went to 93i to §. B3ank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92; to 9S; New Three per Cents., 93 x chequer-bonds, 98d to §; India-bonds, 8s. to 4-so discount; and E xchequer-bills, 2s. discount to 2s. premium. Money is in undiminished demand both in the discount-market and at the Bank, and this must continue to be the case until the payment of the dividends owring to the large amount of the revenue collections. In the Stock-Exchange 6 per cent, is still the minimum rate for advances on Government securities. A few of the speculative purchases in the StockExchange to-day were said to have been made on the anticipation of a lowering of the rate of discount on Thursday next. The stock of bullion and the reserve of notes are considerably beyond the points at which they stood in May last year, when a reduction to 6 per cent. was a dopted; but among ,many persons an impression prevails that no immediate movement will be made, the transient character of every recent recovery being assigned as the reason for hesitation. There was great activity in foreign stocks to-day, and Russian and Turkish exhibited a further improvement. At the close increased firmness was manifested, several purchases having then been made. The advance in Russian was about 1 per cent. and in Turkish a-half. The operations recorded in the official list were-Mexican, for money, 22i ; for the account, 22i ; Russian Five per Cents., 109 and 110; Sardinian Five per Cents., 89& and 89; Spanish New Deferred, 26; the Certincates of Coupon not funded, 60 ; Turkish Six per Cents., for money, 951, 96i, and i ; for the account, 96k, ? and i; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 101; Venezuela Deferred, 14; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 6S; and the Fourper Cent. Certificates, 97 a. In the corn-market this morning there was an advance of between 2s, and 3s. on the rates of Mfonday ast. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bounne this evening -were 68f. 70c. for money and 69f. 16c. for the end of the nonth, showing a reaction of a quarter per cent., in consequence of sales for delivery. Some of the principal letters from :Pans e,xpreass doubts of any reduction being made next Thursday in te rate of discount of the Bank of France. Others assert not only that an alteration will be resolved upon, but that it will be to the extent of 1 per cent. The directors it is said, greatly desire that the first step should be taken by the Blank of England. The specie by La Plata to-day is 211,5001., of which 120,0001. is gold, chiefly from Califoria. The specie by the American steamer is 245,0001. Of this 10,0001. is on French account, and the remainder will be purchased for the same destination. The commercial advices are favourable, and describe a further rally of about one per cent, in the stockmarket. Erie was quoted 37j;Reading, 81a ; New York Central, 87; Panama, 97; and llinois Central, 391 pm. There was increased ease in the discount-market, and for the first time for several years the rates had fallen to the London level, loans on good security being reailly offered at 6 per cent. The uext steamer to arrive is the Columbia, a large new vessel, purchased for the Collins line. She wirl bring, it is said, at least 100,0001., and will be followed by the Arabia, with 300,0001. he advices from Peru by the present mail state hat the cause of the revolutionists had become hopeless, Arequipa being now the only point held by General Vivanco. The insurgent fleet had surrendered, and the Government bad despatched a force to resume control at the Chincha Islands. From Buenos Ayres accounts have been received of the address of the new President, Dr. Alsina. lin announcing the arrangement effected with the English bondholders, subject to the approval of the Chambers, he expressed his satisfaction at the prospect of the alrhir being adjusted " in a way that will equitably conciliate all interests." The demand for silver is at present inastive, owing to the inability to despatch by the next Indian mail more than the total already engaged, it being found impossible to effect further insurances. The rate has advanced from 353. to sOa. per cent., and the latter amount has been offered in vain. Policies, however, are already being opened for the succeeding mail. Tbe accounts of the state of trade in the manufacturing towns for the past week indicate increased steadiness. At Manchester there has been a moderate business, snfficient, with the present restrictions on production to lighten stocks and give firmness to urices. The Birmingham advices describe a tenaency to improvement in the iron market, while for the general manufactures of the town there is also a fair home and foreign demand. In the woollen districts there has been no material change, but the tone is favourable. At Nottingham the hosiery and lace trades are both inactive, and the Irish linen-markets are without alteration. The report of the Chartered Bank of Australiahas been issued preparatory to a meeting on the 26th. Although the spirit of overtrading and speculation in Australia has necessitated great caution, the Bank is gradually extending its business, and the advices up to the latest dates are satisfactory. The profitsfor the half-year ending the 31st of December were 22,9771., out of which a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum is recoramended, leaving a balance of 6,1021. to be carried forward. The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised eight vessels-three to Port PhilliD, one to kydney, one to Auckland, one to Adelaide, one to Portlaud Bay, and one to Launceaton-with an aggregate capacity of 6.154 tons. The rates of freight show a slight tendency to improvement. In the general business of the port of London during the past week there has been diminished activity, chiefly oNing to the unfavourable state of the wind, which has prevented the arrival of many vessels now due. The total number of ships reported inward was 174, being 158 less than in the previous week. These incluided five with cargoes of coflee, 27 sugar, 25 corn, rice, &c., and one comprising 23,165 packages of tea and 832 bales of silk. The total number of vessels cleared outward was 138, including 17 in ballast, showing an iacrease of 19. The dividends on Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cent. stock have been advertised for payment.

THE COR. TRADE. ARK-LANE, SEONDAY AiPnOox, JUN 15. Last week's supplies were altogether sm81L To cxports were 1,184 quarters wheat, 118 quarters barley, 190 quarters malt, 113 quarters oats, 45 quarters beans, 70o quarters maize, and 280 sacks flour. Of English wheat the receipta were 10,179 quarters, the foreign only 5,134 quarters. The morning's supply from Bent and Essex was moderate, and the samples were froely taken at 23. to 3s. advance, an improvement of 2s. per quarter being reAlized on foreign, without the same readiness of sale. There were 15,121 sacls of country flour, with 75 barrels and 251 sacks of foreign. Norfolks found a ready sale at 3s. advance, the price being raised to 46s. per sak. American was also fully la per barrel higher. Town millers raised their top quotations to 54. per sack. The English barley received was only 175 quarters, the foreign being 2,625 quarters Late supplies having put buyers intostock, the demand Wu not eager, but prices remained firm. In caltno change took place. The total supply of oats wa but 13,130 quart.rs; of these 208 were English, 1,200 Irish, and 11,722 from abrc;d. Needy buyers had to pay full prices for all descriptions, especially of sweet corn. The sapply of beaus consisted of 456 quarters home-grown and 122 quarters foreign. Of English peas there were only 43 quarters, of foreign but 70 quarters. Neither of thee was altered, the demand for both being slack. Of linseed there were 6,748 quarters, with 510 quarters exported. The trade was steady, and cakes rather dearer.

Tho Court this day took several cases from the New Trial Paper, bat nothing oocurred to call for . report. BUSIHSS OP THE COUXiT. Lord CAmPBELL gave notice that he would to-morrow sit at Nisi Prius in the Lord Chancellor's Court. (Sitting at N>is Prius at T estmin7te- before Mr. Tuatice WIGIEnA.W and a Specia Jury.) THE QUEEN V. PAIRIiE AND OTEHn. This case, which had been part heard on Saturday, was resumed at the dtting of the Court, and the evidence for the prosecution proceeded with. The first witness called William Brown, police-constable 32 H, who tated he had been on the beat in the neigbbourhood of the defendants, premises both night and day - the smell arising from them was most offensive. He hiad resided in the neighbourhood, and had suffered so much in health that he was obliged to leave on account of the smell. Cross-examined-He had never madeanycomplaint to the defendants, nor to his inspector, nor ever made any entry in his book. Some otber constables on the beat ave similar evidence, and a number of residents in the neighbourhood depoed to the ill effects produced on them by the exhalation from tbe factory. On cross-examination they admitted they had never Made any complaint to tbe defendants, nor had ever felt it neoessary to consult a modical man. Dr. Godfrey, of 33, Finsbury-square, stated he hd a place of business in Mount-place, WhitechapeL He knew defendants'factory. He had received several complaints from his patients ofthe smells from it. He had perceived them hiniself, they were most disgusting and homble, aud produced sickness in the stomach, giddinews. headache, and difficulty in breathing. He went last Wednesday tbree veek, between 3 and 4 in the afternoon, to inspect the factory; the smell was most offensive, and was perceptible in the street. When he got home he found the smell of the gas was in the cloth of his coat. In his opinion the gases evolved in the burning of animal charcoal are the meet prejudicial of any. On the premises he found a sickening heavy smell, but did not personally experience any nusea. There was nothing to prevent the gases escaping into the Croes-exrmnmed.-Opposite his homse in Mount-place there was a most dreadful knacker's yard. There were several most offensive factories in WhitechapeL Were it not for them the place would be well enough. He had also inspected the defendant sugar refinery. He considered it a nuisance. He found a carbonaceous heavy smell from it. On several occasions his patients told hia they could not open their windows on account of the smelL The prooess at the defendants' is, that the charcoal in a damp state is nled on a floor at the top of the building, thenoe it passes down a number of tubes, and while passing through. them is ex. posed tothe action of the furnaces. The vapour evolved again rises through the tubes, carrying with it all the i. puriies of the charcoal, and escapes through the windows of the upper room into the atmosphere. There is a shaft leading fromthe room. If the room was hermetically closed thenthe vapours would be carriedoffbytbe shaft, but at pre. sent they escape through the windows and door. There is a fin to draw the vapour into the ehaft. Even if all the vapours were carried offby a shaft 40 feet high they would stil be prejudicial to the neighbourhood. Re-examined.-There was an opening under the eaves of the building by which the gas might escape, and he could see the light through the tiles of the roof. The gas was much heavier than the atmosphere and would sink, so that a shaft 40 feet high would not be sufficient to carry it off. Mr. Henry Stuckey, surgeon and general practitioner in Wellelose-square, stated he had practised in the neighbour. hood of the defendants' factory for thrce yeas and a-half his patients had frequently complained of its effects. The complaints were not so frequent of late ; he had himself experienced the smells, and they were such as would ucount for the symptoms of his patients. Cross-examined.-He had never made any complaint to the defendants or to the authorities. Itwas only yesterday (Sunday) he was asked to give evidence. There were severil fried fish shops in Backchurch-lane, the smell of which was most offensive. Charcoal was a disinfectant. He had attended a patient named ILunday for illness, a consequenoo of these smells, who was suffersug from headache and vomitiDg; he lived next toasfried fishashop, and waSnowv in typhus fiever. tTfhe former symptomas were those of persons sick n- Dr . 3). Thomson, of St. John's-wood, lecturer on chymistry at St. Thomas's Hospital, stated he had visited the defendants' premises and inspected the process carried on there. It consisted in heating in iron tubes charcoal which bad previously bean used for the purifying of sugar. The chucoal contains a considerable nercentage of matter acquired from the sugar, both in asoli form and in a state of water. The syrup, before it passes through the charcoal, is in colour from black to dark brown, and generally diaphanons; the charcoal takes from itall the colouring matterand impurties and leaves it a colourless liquid. Animal charcoal extracts the colouring matter then better than wood. After tho sugar has passed a stream ofwater is poured on the charcoal in order to remove any sugar that may remain. The charcoal, then in a moist state, is carried to the burning house. A speimen of this charcoal had been sent to him by the defendants for experiment, He found the quantity of water in it varied from 14, to 21 per cent. There was on an aveyage 43 per cent. of vegetable matter, which it loses by igmtion in a close vessel; the rest was animal charcoaL By experiment he found that in the process of burning certain permanent gases, salts, and vapours wero evolved, In one experiment on two grains of charcoal 60 per cent. of the gas was carbonic acid, but he had not much confidence in that experiment. He found also carbonio oxide and carburetted hydrogen. These are al noxious gases; he also found hydrogen. The vapours were in small quantities, but had a very disagreeable odour; they were what are generaly called hydro-carbon. The salts were acetate of ammonia, carbonate of ammonia, and sulphide of ammonium; the latter is very deleterious. He found they produced oppression of the chest, giddiness, and t ausea; he had tried the experiment on himself and others in his laboratory. In the defendants' factory the iron tubes containing the charcoal, closed atthe bottom, are placed verticaly, and exposed to the heat of the furnce. The products of the ignition escape from the top of the tubes into a loft. When he saw it there were two broken panes, through which the gases escaped, and the room did not appear to be airtight. It could not have been, for the men could not work there. Even if it had been airtight, and all the vapours were carried off by a shaft 40 feet high, that 'Would not be sufficient to relieve the neighbourhood. If 10,000 tons a-year were burnt, it would be highly prejudicial to the health of persons residing near it. If the gases, salts, and vapours produced by the first ignition were passed through a fire the nuisance would substantially be removed, so that it would be possible to carry on the process, even in the present premises, without injuriously afecting the neighbourhood. Cross-examined.-His attention was first called to the matter about a mouth ago. He was at defendants premises only once, on Wednesday last; he remained about a quarter of an hour. The loft was excesively hot. He made no experinment on the air in the premises or outside. He found a peculiar odour in the streets; he should have had no difficulty in ascertaining the composition of the air there, but did not do so. Carbonic acid will be produced by burning carbonaceous matter at a red heat in the open air; the quantity produced would depend on the quantity of air admitted to the carbon; in one ex riment he only got 10 per cent. of carbonic acid, he used 2lb. of charcoaL If a large quantity of charcoal was burnt he should not expect to find even so large a percentage of carbonic acid; he could not give any opinion as to the quantity of carbonic acid that would be produced in the process of burning as carried on by the defendants. There was a large quantity of carbonic acid in the Court at that moment; it was highly objectionable and prejudidal to bealth, and certainly was not what he expected to find. (Laughter.) The gases he found were generated by almost every fireplace in London. The sulphite of ammonium which was given out in the burning was most deleterious, even in minute quantities. If there had been any quantity of it In the loft he could have detected it with the ordinary simple tests. He should have liked to make his experimentscnnalargescaleonthepremises, as it would have been more satisfactory. When he was in the loft ho saw the vapour pas^sing near the windows, and concluded it went out. ie would not undertake to say that one ten-thensandth part of wbat passed through the shaft was composed of the deleterous substances he had foeud in hisexperiments. Mr. Redwood, professor and lecturer on chymistry at the Pharmaceutical Society, stated that be aRreed with Dr. Thomson as to the nature of the gases, salts, and vapours evolved in the process of reburning charcoal. The quantity of carbonic aoid varied according to the temperature at which the combustion was carried on. In hia experiments the average was about 70 per cent. Cross-examined.-He had not visited the premises. Four ounces was the largest quantity of charcoal he used in any one experiment. If a quantity of hot dry charcoal was placed over that which was immediately exposed to the action of the fu7rnace the noxious matter wrould be considerably absorbed. Mr; Henry Prickcer, surveyor to the Whitechapel Board of Workcs, stated he hd inspected the defendants' premises, and found a considerable open space under the eaves, and Eeveral noles in tne rooe. Cross-examined.-Ho visited the premises in February. Mr. Charles James, inspector of nuisances for the district, had often felt the smoll from the defendanW premises; it was most offensive. In February last he visited the streets, and general complaints were made to him of the nuisance. Cross-examined.-These complaints were after the indictment had been brought. Re-exanmined.--The first entry of a complaint in his book was November 26, 1S56. This closed the case for the prosecution. M'r. BOVImr then Proceeded to state the case of the defendants. He said that for over 25 years they had been engaged in business in Whiteohapel andfor the whole of that period this process of reburning charcoal h d been carried on by them and by a number of other firms in the samne businiess. About sia years ago, finding they had not sufficient room in their premLses in Church-lane, they took others in Back Church-lane, to which they removedThe process of burning charcoal. If the jury by their verdict declared that the trade should no longer be carried on in tho old manner, the trade not only of the defendants, but of the other houses, would be destroyed. The oompetition with the continent was now so great that it was with, =iflclty, even at present, they Were able to meet it.

Mr. Brands, Professor of ChYmistry at the Royal TsHati tution,stated he had examined the defenaanta'prembes: on the 5th of June. He applied tests, and could mot find that any suiphuretted hydrogen or anip'hite of ammnonium was given off. There wasa aslight amel in the upper part of tij premises resemblingt:hat of burning sugar, but there was nothing thAt could h an annoyance to the nmeighbourhood. Cross-examined.-He had not applied any test for car-. bonic acid. Dr. Ward, of the hospital-ship Dreadnought, had visited the Piremises of Thursday last, and could detect no mnell. Hhabenthere two years ago, and found a' diagreable smell proedn from the water throw onte charcoal, which is: n:ot done in the present process There was nothing prejudicial to health in the process as 'now carried on by the defenidants. Dr. Richardson said he had resided in Whitechapel for eightor nine years.

Drn the prevalence of the cholera there was not a sinlecs among Mr. Fairrie's maen.

Cross.exgunined.-Ho did not know what occasoned the smell untilasrhorttitne since, when On one occasion he saw some vapours hanging about the buildling. Dr. Tripe of Commercial-road, resides about. 150 yards from the defendants' premises, and never exeinaced any -nuisance. He knew nothing of What was going on there until the solicitor for the prosecution spoke to him. None of his patientsB had ever complained to him Cross-examined. -He was present in court on Saturday, and stated that, in his opinion, the symptoms described by the witnesse were produced by the carbonic Oxide and snlphuretted hydrogen evolved in the burning of the cbarcoat Re had changed1his opinon in consequence of hearin rmtewtes noe'mndta no eulPhuretteOd hydroge was evolved.

COURT OF COMMOI PT.RA WA 7 sTm 1r HA}M lr V TA InAnV (&gtings at Arisi Priu., after lTrM, bcfore.-Mr Au CROWD3Ri and Comvw.mn J.iJ 1 whis was an action to recover damages for injuring and siling a quantity of tabrets sent by the plaintiff an up. bolsterer in Leicester-square, to the defendint, a dyer at Brompton, tobe dyed crimson and amber colours, accordin to a sample pattern. The tabarets came hack so badl1 dyed as to be useless, the crimson bein' dyed a bright red brick colour and the amber equally bd. The defendant agreed to d3e them again for nothing, and returned them damaged and spoilt. The plaintiff lamed 411. damages. The case having been fully gone into, the jury retired, and on their return found a verdict forthe plaintiff-Damages, .. Mr. Edwin James, QC., and Mr. Beasley appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Wood for the defendant. An action for an illegal dlstress ocoupied the rest of the day, andwas of no interest except to the parties.
COURT OF EXCHEO1JR E o.vm m X 1 N PR7t"F. V_ Rtlpuv (SiUinls at NW Prius. before. the IA,RD) Crm RATRn_} Mr. Grove and Mr. Phipson were counsel for the plaintiff, Mr. Milward appeared for the defendant. This was an action in which the plaintiff soughb to recover the SUm of 5261k, as money paid for the defendaut. It appeared that the defendant was a sheriff's bailiff, and that the plaintiff entered into a bond to protect the sheriff against any losses which he might sustain in cases vhere the defendant "acted or assumed to act" as his bailiff, In 1845 the sheriff issued his warrant to two other offioers named Williams and Beaton to levy on the goods of one-Jones, and under this wanrant the defendant was in possesson, and so " assumed to aot." In the course of such acting it was alleged that certain irregularities arose on the part of the defendant, and an action was brought against the she. riff by Jones, vhich resulted in a verdict. Thereupon the sheriff brought his action on their bond against the plaintiff and the defendant, which was eventually compromised by the plaintiff's paying 526&. to the sheriff in 1852. In crderto prove the fact of psymentthe p tiff s called, I nt he on stated that he sent a aheck in a letter tothe sheriff's attorneys, and, as neither check nor letter was in court, objection was made by the defendant's counsel to all allusion to their contents, and all that the plaintiff could further say was that he had afterwards told the defendant he had paid the sheriff, and that he had not been ap plied to by the sheriff on the subject of the bond since the date of his letter to the attorneys. Mr. IL.wA-D, for the defendant, objected that there vas no evidence to go to the jury to prove the fact of payment of any particular snm, and next that the plaintiff and defendant were not liable at all on their bond to the sheriff, as the warrant did not contain the name of the defendant as the officer. The Caixr BARoT said there was some evidence to go to the jury in support of the fact of payment, though it was no doubt very slight. He accordmngly should leave the question to the jury, reserving to the defendant leave to move on that and on the otber point, on which, however, be had no doubt, as the defendant, though not named in the warrant, had " assumed to ad" for the sheriff, and be aDu the plaintiff, as his surety, were liable In respect of that transaction. His Lordship then left it to the Jury to s.y4 whether they thought, on the evidence before them, that the plaintiff had paid the sum for which this action waa brought. On this point he aupposed the youngest person in court would have no doubt whatever, but it had beea objtoted that technically and legally the evidence was not sufficient, and of that objection the defendant would have the full benefit hereafter in the court above, wbere it would be decided whetber he had acted rightly in leaving the question of payment to them The Jury at once returned a verdict for the plaintiff, with 5264 dmages. LINDDUS V. 3MLROSI. In our report of this case on Saturday Last we fell into a formal error in consequence of a misconception as to the form of the rule and the course the case took at the triaL The point decided bythe Court was correctly given, but it should have been staed that the rule was obtained on the part of the defendants and that it was made absolute, vhereas it is made to appear that the rule was obtained by the plamtiff and that it was discharged.

COUTRT OF BANKRUPTCY, Jionday, June 15. TX RR J. _ T - (Before V. O Commissioner GOUT.nRV?RNl 'nhe bankrupt was a builder, of Seven Sisters-road, Holloway. His accounts, prepared by Messrs. Butler and CanDings, show debts exceeding 10,0001., of which 2,2521 are unsecured. This was the certificate meeting. Mr. TiEorALDn, for the assignees, opposed. The bankrupt had been bankrupt in 1849, when his certificate was suspended six months. Under the present bankruptcy there would not be a shiWing for the unsecured creditors. Mr. CGIDLEY, for the bankrupt, urged that under prosperous times there would have been more than sufficient for every creditor, unsecured as we)l as secured. Purchasers of house property generally calculated upon paying 12 years' purchase, thus obtaining 8 per cent. for their money. The state of the raoney-market-bankers paving 6 per cent. for depositshad very seriously affected the value of house property. Pceple would not buy houses to pay only 8 per cent. when bankeers would take their money on call at 6 per cent. The bankrupt had been without his certificate four months already, in consequence of an adjournment. His HoNouI said this was one of those cases of such frequent ocourrence-the case of a mere pauper or puppet put up by somebody else, who, it was well understood, shoald be at liberty to seize everything. These puppet builders ran unp wretched carcases of houses, borrowing aU they could unon them as fast as they were put up, and getting into debt .ath everybody around them. 7,1731. had been advanced by the creditors holding security. The carcases, on being pat up for sale, would not realize that sum, and the unsecured creditors for 2,2Z21. would not obta a ferthing. The suspension of the banksupt's certificate for six montbs in 1849 not havi-g had much effect, there would under this bankruptcy be a suspension of 12 months. Allowance would, however, be made, as suggested by Mr. Chidley, for the four months that had already elapsed since the original sitting. The certificate (third class) vwould thus issue after the lapse of one year from the 6th of February Lasd. Protection was granted. IN RE- This was a trader debtor summons, the object being to obtain from the debtor a bond giving sectrsty for 7001., the amount claimed by the creditor in an action now pending. For tho creditor it was urged that the debtor being a foreign merchant, who had dishonoured a bill for 7,0001., and who, nevertheless, was living in the most costly style, having a mansion at Twiokenham (rent 7501 a-year), apartments in Oxford-terrace at 1501. a-year, and a phaeton and eight or ten horses, it was only reasonable that security should be given. It was not an uncommon occurrence for foreign merchants having large transactions to fail for large amounts with small assets, and they bad then no tie to a foreign country. The debt vias for wine of the choicest and most costly class. The debtor was a single man. The cartage of the wine had been Daid by the debtor, and there was no ground for defending the action, except.to gain tiine. For the debtor, it was urged that he was one of the first merchants in the city (his transactions being measured almost by millions); that the wine had been ordered for the purpose of obtaining security for a claim upon the creditor; that the bill of 7,0001. referred to had been paid or liquidated in cash and goods; and that its dishonour was not from want of funds, but with an object. HEs HoNouR said the debtor would appear to be living in the style of a quasi Prince, and, not considering that'he ad explained in a straightforward manner the dishonour of the bill, a bond woald be required. Fourteen days would be allowed to op _a
BRISTOL DISTRICT COURT OF B3ANKRUPTOY, Monday, June 15. RE GEORGE WORRALL JONES-REFUSAL OF CERTTlf.Aw (Before Mllr. COmsiMoMWr HILL.) ±ae oanKrupr carred on business as a banker at Crick. howell, Breconshire, and stopped payment in May, 1856. The allowance of his oertificate vas opposed by Mr. Edlin, of the Western Circuit (instructed by Messrs. W. Bevan and Girling, of Bristol), on behalf of the assignees on general grounds, and also on the part of four creditors, on the specific ground that the bankrupt had fraudulently re- resented his hank to them as a branch of the Bmon Old Bank of Messr. Wilkms and Co. MIr. Prideaux (instructed bg Mr. J. G. Price, of Abegavenny) supported the bankrupt. The arguments of counsel and the examination of witnesse occupied the Court for two days, and this. day his Honour deliveredthe followingjudgment, which embracesall the material points of the case :-In the year 1834 the bankrupt became the proprietor of the Crickhowell Bank, succeed. ing a person named Gratrex. He does not appear to have been possessed of capital, but traded on a loan of 5,0001. from Messrs. Wilkins andCo., of the Brecon Old Bank. This loan was made on condition that the bankrupt should pay interest at 4 per cent., should circulate no local notes but those of the Brecon Old Bank, should cash checks drawn on the Brecon Old Bank without charging any commission, and should gratuitously receive deposits for the Brecon Bank madeby its oustomers at Cr.ckhowell. After trial the bankrupt, finding that with so small a capital he could not carry on his business, a new arrangement was effected with the Brecon Bank, by which further advances were to be made from time to time, no limit appearing to be fixed between the partles. For these he was in ike manner to pay 4 per cent., but in consideration of his services the interest on the first loan was reduced from 4 to 2.J per cent. On this footing the bankrupt carried on his concern up to the time of his bankruptcy, in May, 1856. During this long period of 22 years the bankrupt never once ascertained the state of his affairs. By the investigation -which has been made since his bankruptoy for the purpose of preparing his balance-sheet, which commences with the 1st of January, 1850, it appears that he was at that time insolvent to the extent of 1,5001., even estimating the debts owing to him at their full amount. Probably if a due valuation of these assets could be made it would appear that his deficit was far greater. The same supineness which prevented him from ascertaining his owml position led him to keep the passbooks of his customers in arrear, and this again induced him to refrain from pressing such among thom as were his debtors for payment, so that the suuls owing to him as they stand it his books will be ruinously diminished in their realization-debts always diminishing in value in proportion to the delay with which they are collected. In process of time the Brecon Bank became uneas at the swelling amount of their advances to the bankrupt which had reached the suns of 11,0001. Whatever security the bankrupt had it in his power to offer bad long been given. his assets (with the exception of furniture and plate, and other property, amounting altogether to somewhat less than 6501.) consisted entirely of debts due to him for advances made to his various customers. On the 21st of February, 1856, the Brecon Bank dishonoured one of his checks. From that moment it became absolutely impossible for him to continue his bank for any long period. On the 12th of March his difficulties prom ted him to consult Mr. Prce, his solicitor, who telegraphed to London for an accountant. This gentleman camne down within a day or two, and, although he was assisted by the bankrupt, yet it was not until the Ist of April that he was able to prepare a statement showing the amount of the debts due to and from the bankrupt. By this account it appeared, as it did in 1850, that,even taking the debts owing to hm at their full amount, he was insolvent. In 1850 that apparent insolvency was only to the extent of 1,5001. It was now, however, increased to 7,6001. The real deficiency as it was subsequenit ascertained by duly estimating the value of the debts owin. to the bankrupt, and as it stands recorded in the balancesheet signed by the bankrupt, is little short of 40.0001. The private expenses of the bankrupt for himself, his wifo, and children were moderate, not amounting to 6001, per annum. His trade expenseswere also low, not exceeding with repairs 2001. a-year. His losses, therefore, by his trade must have averaged 1,000I per annuilj at the least. With the exception of Messrs. Wikins arad Co., his credi. tors mainly consist of depositors, many of whom can ill afford the loss which they hve sustained, and, although the sum is but small in comparison with those lost in cerWain late failures to which public attention has been mitch directed, yet falling where it does it is a very severe calamity; consequently, the case demanded, and has received, a strict and searching scrutiny. The assignees have spared no pains to probe the transactions of the concern to the bottom; and, on the other hand, the bankrupt has been so fortunate as to engage very zealous and able services on his behalf. The assignees, joined by other ereditors, oppose on various grounds the grant of any certificate to the 6ank. rupt. First, they impugn his general conduct as a trader ; secondly, they charge him with contracting debts on false pretences; thirdly, with obtaining forbearance of debts by false pretences ; fourthly, with the fraudulent preference of a particular creditor; and, lastly, with not keeping proper books of account. That the imnutation conveyed in the first ground of objection is well-founded cannot, after the narrative which bas been already presented, be for a morhent questioned. I postpone the consideration of its full effect until I have disposed of the remaining grounds. The charge of contracting debts on false pretences and obtaining forbearance of debts on false pretences may he treated of jointly. With reference to these charges two allegations are made. There was a general false pretence, it is urged, runniDg tbrough the whole course of his dealings. Bythe manner in which be conducted his bank he held it out to the world as a branch of the Brecon Bank, whereas he now states that he was merely the agent of Wilkins and Co. for and that there was no other connexion bevet etobanks except such agency. In support of tiF, teir first allegation, the assignees drew the attention of the Court to various c'rcumstai.ces, all tendiag to cseate the impreeslim thati she Brecun Bank. was responsible for the debts of the Crickhowell Bank. The Crickhowell Bank circulated no local notes but those of the Brecon Bank. According to its rules, whenever the CrickhoweU Bank cashed a cleck drawn on any other bank than itself it ebarged a commission, but it excepted from this rule the Brecon Bank, placing, therefore, the customers of that bank on tbe same footing as its own. It was proved that for Eome years in the earlier part of his trading the bankrupt was in the habit of drawing notes of hand to he signed by bis customers receiving advances, and that he made such notes payable at "Wilkins and Co.'s, Crickhowell Bank J- that he was also in the habitof taking up acceptances maAepayable at "Wilkios and Co.'s, Crickhowell Bank," and that some of those acceptances on their way to the Crickhowell Bank passed through an acknowledged branch of the Brecon I Bank, rituate at Merthyr. The bankrupt's explanation of this I very reprehensible practice is asurmise(for he does not pledze himself to the fact) that he must have followed the example of his prodecessor, Mr. Gratrex. Why it was discontinued does not clearly appear, but no evidence wan adduced to show that any one of the existing body of creditors had been cognizant of the usage until after the bankruptcy, It must, however, bave contributed in no small degree to produce a misleading effect on tho public mind, and but for its discontinuanee would have been strong evidence of a fraudulent intent. Again, it was proved that an almanac was bung in the bankrupt's place of business which described the Criekhowell Bank as a branch of the Brecon Old Bank. It was proved by the bankhupt's clerk, Mr. Worts, that he was under the impression that his employer's bank was a branch of the Brecon Bank, and that the bankrupt had produced that impression on his mind by habitually designating the Brecon Bank as " our" bank. But here it must be stated that all knowledge that his bank was described in the almanac as a branch of the Brecon Bank was denied by the bankrupt, and,having regard to various circumstances given in evidence, I am disposed tobelievein the truth of this deniaL It should be further mentioned that the bankrupt gave 1 per cent. more of interest upon deposits than was allowed at the Brecon Bank, and, as he received detosits for both banks it is not likely that a knowledge of this course of business would be confined to a very few individuals, but it is difaicult to understand how any persons cognizant of these two distinct rates of interest could suppose the banks were oxie and the same concern. On behalf of the assignees it was further stated that the bankrupt bad given accountable receipts for deposits on prited forms surreptitiously obtained from the Brecon Bank, and that he had also surreptitiously obtained and employed forms of receipts used by the Brecon Bank. To support this imputation Mr. Evans, a partner in the Brecon bank, was called as a witness, who testified to his utter ignorance of the fact thit the bankrupt had possessed himself of these blank forms, and averred that the use which he made of them was altogether unauthorized by the Brecon firm. On behalf of the 'bankrupt, however, irrefragable testimony was adduced to show tbat the blank forms had been supplied to the bankrupt by the Brecon Bank inthe course of business, and that it was cognizant of the manner in which they were used, It is due to Mr. Evans to state that no knowledge of the pogsession by the bankrupt of these blank forms was brought personally home to that gentleman; and, on the other hand, itis due to the bankrupt to state that, both as regards the possession and the use of those forms, he stands acquitted of the slightest impropriety of conduct as between himself and the Brecon Bank. The second allegation, as to the bankrupt havg falsely aserted his bank to be a branch of the Brecon Bank, was one which, if it had been proved, must have drawn down on the bankrupt consequences highl] penaL Ele was accused of having explicitly state to two of his depositors that such a connexion did exist. Much time was occupied in hearing the conflicting evidence adduced upon the one side and on the other in reference to this charge, and if in the result I had arrived at the conclusion that it had been sustained in eithir of the two instances specified I should have thought it necessary to enter, in my judgment, fully into the particularsof this part of the case. But as, after a very anxious consideration of the subject, I cannot arrive at a result on which my mind can steadfastly rest unmoved by doubts and misgivings, I do not feel it necessary to pursuo the topic any further, except to relieve the witnesses on both sides from any apprehension that the Court has doubted the desire of each to speak the truth. But where the matter in controversy relates to words used rivi voce, and to -words alone, contradictions the most direct and the most irreconcileable will, in many cases, be far from justifying a Court in assuming that the witnesses on either side have been guilty of perjury; and this remark especially holds good where the matter to be proved has been made the common talk of a town or district. Witnesses who do not carefully watch the operations of their own minds are liable after a lapse of time to confound what they heard at the moment at which they are speaking with what others have told them, and what they themselves have imained Imeanwhile. The reasonableness of this view may probably be doubted by those whose avocations have not frenuently brought them into courts of justice. They would be ur prised to hear that, contrary to what they have a right to suppose the natural order of events, it too frequently happens that the memory of witnesses, judging from their evidenco, becomes more full and more exact on the vital points of the case in proportion as they are removed by distanceof time from the occurrencesrespectingwhich theygive their testimnony. Butsolt is. The imputation, then, of having employed false pretences, either direct or indirect, I hold not to be satisfactorily proved. But the facts elicited by the inquiry into that part of the case seriously affect the ques. tio of misconduct in the general course of the trade. In addition to those which 1 have already noticed must be added this :-Mr. Davies, a solicitor, called at the bank aud inquired of the bankrupt whether his concern was or was not a branch of the Brecon Bank. To this question he very properly received an immediate and explicit answer in the negative. But the inquiry ought to have opened the bankrupt's eyes to the misconception which had oeen created by the transactions arising out of his agency to the Brecon Bank, and he was bound publicly to notify that he had been acting as agent only, and not as partner. He ought also to have ceased to give his own depositors checks on the Brecon Bank, such a practice being likely to midead many rmo them into the belief that the instruments which they held gave them a claim on Messrs. Wilkins and Co. The charge of a fraudulent preference rested on very technical grounds, and was candidly withdrawn during the argument. The last charge is that of not having kept proper books of account, the omission of a cashbok being especially relied upon. This charge is fully borne out. There was no casbbook. It is, however, perfectly true that from the books which were kept Mr. Power, the accountant, has been ablo to construct a cashbook. This part of the case, therefore, materially diffors from those instances which have too often occurred, in which not only was there the absence of a cashbook, but the absence of all means by which a eash account could be framued. Nevertheless, the omission cannot but be highly censured. The value of a cashbook is not limited to its enabling a trader to exhibita cash account when called upon to frame one. He ought to keep it in a form for daily use and reference. It is held by Courts of Bankruptcy to be a failure of duty in any trader to carry on his concern without a cashbook, but in the case of bankers, whose whole dealings are in cash, it seems monstrous that any member of such a body, however i- instructed in the duties which he had undertaken to er form, could be ignorant that a cashbook 'was to him a necassary of commercial hfe. The general result of this inquiry has been that, with the exception of the last ground of objection, no specific charge apainst the bankrupt has been made out with sufficient clearness to lustily the Court in acting uponL it, But, although the facts adduced in evidence may not sustain specific charges, they may, nevertheless, asd in this case most assuredly do, aggirmvate the general misconduct alleged against him as the first and leading imputation. Returning, then, to thait firt ground of objection;' I ami compelled to adtvert to soe additional facts 'which taken in connexion with-those on which I have oomh mented, miflitate strongly, and, I mnust add, fatally, against the grant of any certi avte, even of the lowestClas. It a pears that on the 21st of the February preceding the bana ruptoy the Brecon Bank resrted to extreme measure. They dishonoured one of the bankrupt's chocks, Surely, this was a monition which ought to have had the most decided effect upon his conduct. Messrs Wilkins and Co., the proprietors of the Brecon Bank, were not only the principal creditors, but it was on their advances that he had been tradling from the first. 'Upon their wil it depended whether or not he should retain a single hour of credit. But this is net the worst. A. few months prior to hischok bingdishonoured the bankrupt had been asked by.l Mr.Evans, one *of the firm, if he wore solvnt,and hi anwerwas in the affirmative. There is omedisreanc bewen the evidence of Mr. Evans and thatof he aakuptas t one portion of the conversation, butthe boh areethus far-that this question was asked, endtha ananserin the affirmative was given. Now, hero was an aberration from truth insa matter of the highest impitncetoboth the parties to the interview. The bukrut wasinselvent-that is clear, His excuse is that be was not cognizant of the fact. Suppose that to to so, Suppose him to have been deaf t-' 'II the warnvings ,which the state of his affairs In,. incontro- vertible hermustbhave received. The true que.miOn to be asked is whether he had any ground for believing in his solvncy?Non hasbeenoffred-onecould be offered. He pedgd hmsel toa fct wichdidnot exist, and he did so wen, y a rimial nglec ofhis most obvious dutis b wasnotirs poitio topledge himself at all.~akng he ostchaitale iewof his state of mind hecoud hae ben ustiiedin aking no further subject on whichhc was questioned But such areplymuste have closed his account with the Brecon Bank, must have brought an overwhelming olaim upon him, and thus must have produced an immediate stop page, The answer, then whic he did give was a criminal aot, by which he Was enabled to continue his trading and to draw the property of now creditors into Ids hands. Indeed, so reckless was his conduct that even after he found that his assertion of his solvency, however it might have been received at first failed eventually to restore hia to sufficient confidence in the eyes of Wilkins and Co. to engage them to support his credit by honouring his checks, he nevertheless persisted in two instances to give checks upon their bank in exchange for deposits-one on the 3d of March, 1856, to Mr. Fudge for 501., and one on the 6th of March to Mrs. James for 61. With regard to the last of these checks, it appears that he refunded the 61. shortly after its roceipt on certain repreeentations being made to him. I lay no stress on this fact. Perhaps it might be used against him as an admission that he had done wrong, but no such admiesion is required. On the other hand, as regards the moral effect of issuing such a check, it cannot be changed by returning the deposit. Even at a later period there was a transaetion in wbich be behaved in a very discreditable manner to Mr. Roberts, but it isunneces. saryto enter into futher details. After suchanexpositionasit haa een tbe duty of the Court to make, it cannot be doubted that to grant a certificate to this bankrupt would be to aot in defiance of all the principles of the bankrupt law. The object of that law is on the one hand to relieve debtors from the consequences of those perils of trade to which it is notoriously exposed; and on the other to divide the remnant of their property equitably among their various creditors. In executing this duty courts are em- powered to give the h eDt of the law to all traders who by a ctbrtahl construction of their conduct are deemed to bave so conducted their concerns as to be within the g ene: ral scope and intention of this great provision, although they may not be free from blame. But the law is not meant to hold out its benefits to porsocs who syatematically set at nought aU the safeguards against ruin, 'which honest traders have devied for their own protection and that of their creditors and which now form the established usages of commerce. Not to press the case even to its legitimate linits against the bankrupt, it is quite clear that he haa neglected and repudiated th seaafegauards, and he must uow bear the consequences of the line of conduct which he has so long pursued. His claim to a certificate is disallowed. One question remains. Shall he have protection ? He is a man advanced in years, and in regard to protection there !are favourable features in his case. Mr. Acraman, his Officiasignee, and Mr. Power, the accountant, who, with their clerks, have gone through the laborious task of making UP his accounts-both gentlemen having had for months an opportunity of observing his conduct with regard to the interests of his estate, speak in high terms of his exertions to repair his former neg ect (to the slight extent in which he is able now to repair it) by the most sedulous application to his books, and to the collection of h-s debts. Mr. Acraman further reports that the services of the bankrupt will be of the last importance tothecreditors in the further collectionxof thedebtsyet outstanding; and therefore, having regard to these considerations, I trust I violate no duty in continuing to him the same protection to his person which he has enjoyed ever since his sulrrender under his adjudication in bankruptcy, euch protecfon, however, being liable to discontinuance on its being shown to the Court that it is no longer deserved.
I CENTRAL CRIINA L C OOURT. June 15. The sittings of this Court for the June session were _pened this morning before the Right IIon. T. O. .Umni, Lord Mayor, Mr. Russell Gurney, Q.O., Recorder;, Mr. T. Chambers, Comnmon-Serjeant, Alderman Sir B. W. Carden, LP., Mr. Sheriff Mechi, Mr. Uztder-Sheriff Crosey, Mr. Under-SheriffAnderton, &o. Tnhe Sist edition of the calendar contains the names of 1f2 prisoners, whech is rather more than the nsualaverage consderng the period that has elapsed since the last ad hururment of the Courf . Thc ECOR.DETh in his cha rge to the Grond Jnry, said, he was sorry he had to inform them that there were a great many cases in the calendar, although very few of them were of a cowhicated character, or likely to give them any difficulty woen they were brought before them for conmsderation. There vere two charges involving the destruction of human lie, both of which wouldassume the form of manslaughter. The first was one of the ordinarg description, where there had been a scuffle and fiht between the parties, and a blow n as struck by the prisoner, wich resulted in the death of the deceased. The only question for the grand jury in this case was whether the blov, which undoubtedly was the cause of death, was strack in selfkdefence and if this were not made ont to their satisfaction it would be their duty to return the bill. The other case of manslaughter was of a mnore peculiar description. The accused person was a medical man, an accoucheur, and it appe red that he had attended the deceased woman during her coninement and her death was alleged to have been occasioned by want of proper shill on his part in the course of the operation. The lawr undoubtedly required that every mnan who took upon himself scne a charge as this should bring to the performance of it as easonable amount of sknll and knowlede, aund if the grand tury should he of opinion that thoe accwhs was not poassessed of such an amount of skill or knowledge, or that there had been a gross want of care and cp wabls negligence in the treatment of the deceased, in eit herof there cases it would be their dutylto ind the bill for etvslaughter. There were twFo charges of wounding wlith intent to muzder, but there did not appear to be anything in the facts that were liely topresnt any difiiculty, and therefore it was runecessy for haim to make any observations respecting them. One case that would come before them wc s a charge of arson, woich was of an aggravated charaoter, because it was hllegedthat persons were in the house, whose lives might have been sacificed, at the time the offence waas commntted. In general, in caes of this description the offence was sought to be estabished by circumstantial evidence, but in the present instance it appeared that the prisoner was represented to have told a person, ho would be called before them as a w itness, of his intention to commit the offetce, and also of his having committed it. This was certainly a peculiar state of things, for it did not appear that the pisoner wished the person to whom he was represented to have nade the statement to render him any assistance in the commission of the offence, or that he ad any motive for maidng such a communication to himn.It awpeared, however, that this per0s n did at once mae a communication to the police of what had taken tencebetween him and the prisoner, and it would the duty of the grand jury to sea whether there was suffiCent evidence to corroborate the statement of the witness in question to induce them to coPe to the conclusion that he was speaking the truth; had, if this were made out to their satisfaction, they would, of course, find the bilL There was only one other case to which he considered £t necessary to dirert their attention, wh ch was a charge against three persons named Tawlor, ters, and Ma cons re g together to obain goods by Talse pretences, and the enidence appeared to be of rather a complicated character, One of the defendants, it appeared, was the agent of a ma nufacturer in Ireland hsae f goods, and it seemed that he had desired to otaa suppy of ods for certain parties ehom his employer WaS not incled to trust, and the correspondence and the other evi dence in the case went to show that the prosecutors wvere induced to a pply the goods under a belief that they were to be consigned to other parties, wdhen, in point of fact they were supplied to the persons whom the prose- nter.s were unwilling to give credit to. The ques tions for the consideration of the grand jury under theso circumstances would be whetn er the proceeding was an honest transaction on the pert of the persons concerned, or whether they had conspired together to cheat and defraud tho prosecutor; and if they came to thh conclusion that this was the case it ofould be their duty to find a true bill against *1a the defendants, The grand jury then retired, and the Court proceeded to dispose of the busiaess of the session.

Lote, who appeared for the prosecation, said, that the corporation in preferring this indetment ad, of aoue no other object than to put ia end to a pzoceeding which, according to the evidence, most seriensly endangered the safety of the neighbourhood; and, as the defendants had undertaken that the whole of the napbtha should be reuoved, and that it should never be kept again in such large nuantities upon the premises, he wvas content that the ~efendants snul enter into recognizances to appea and receive the judgment of the Court if they should be caled upon to do so. One of the defendants said, he should wish to inform the Court, that although the jury had returned a verdict of '. guilty," it was raore byarrangement that this had been putting their case before the C o If they had 4.one so, they would have been in a position to show that it was quite an accidental circumstance that so large a quantity of naphtha was upon the premises at the time in question, owIng to the Government, for whom they were preparing it under a contract, not being able at the timeto receive itand, with regard to the question of danger, they should have been able to show that the insurance-offces insured their premises at a reduced rate of premium,wch showedthat they, at all events, did not consider the're was any danger in the proceeding. The COMMO-SERJEANT said, it would undoubtedly have been of importance to prove these facts, but theCourt could notnow enter into the matter. The defendants then entered into the required sureties, and left the Court. Joseph Smith, 38, wvas indicted for stealing a quantity of sugar, tea, sugarcandy, and other articles, the property of Thomas Cooper, his mast,er. Mr. Giffard prosecuted; Mr. Ribton was counsel for the It appeared that the prosecutor was a wholesale grocer in Monument-yard, and that the prisoner had been for three years in his service as porter, and that in consequence of a considerable quantity of property being missed two detective officers belonging to the city police, namned Webb and Scott, were employed to watch the premis with a view to detectthe depredator. On the day named in t,he p prem-ises; and when he had gone. a short Ideisane oelhe took a' bundle from under his clothes and he was then wratched by - the offlcers to the shop of a Lfr. Spicer, an oilmnan in Alderagate-street, when he was taken into custody in the act of disposing of the contents of the bundle, which conmiBted of tea, ugar sugareandy, and currants, and it appeared that be ba for a year and a-halt been in the habit Of Eelling similar articles, which had no doubt been stolenfromMr. Cooper. The prisoner, it appeared, was seen by the offlcers on five different occasions in one week to leave his master's warehouse with small quatities of -tolen property, and there appeared to be no doubt that he had been carryi on a ar system of plunder. The jury foun the prisoner Guilty, and The Cow on SEajrA= said, he felt it his duty, under the aggravated circumstances of the case, to sentence him to be kept in penal servitude for four years. The jurT said, they were of opinion that Mr. Spicer onght to be cautioned, and that he had acted very improperly in purehasing the property from the prisoner. The Commox-S Srn.sN said, ir. Spicer had no doubt acted very improperly, and might have brought himself into considerable danger, and he hoped he would act mnore cautiously in future. George Richard Clark, who was out on bail, was called upon to surrender and takce his trial, ith a wonan Daned Re.Bush, upon an hndictment framed under a stattte known as the Bishopi of Oxford's Act, which charged them with having conspired together, and by false pretences, procFured the defilement of a girl underl16 years of age, naed lreh male defendant did not surender, and Serijeant P.RP.Y, who appeared in his behalf, asked the Court to allow the trial to stand over, to see whether he would make his appearane. Mi. SLEI4, who oonducted the prosecution, said he rerted that he had consented to Clark being admitted to Dbal, as he beheved there was no doubt he did not intend to surrender. He therefore appliedto the Court to order his recognizances to be estreated, and that a warrant ahould be uissud for his apprehension. One of the persons who had become bail for the defendant sad that ho saw him last Wedneaday, but he had not seen 9r heard anything of him since. If the Court, however, ted a warrant he should offer a reward for his avpreension, he believed he should be able to lay ho, of him, and if he did he assured the Court be should not get a from him very easily. The aOmsm.o.mSa-ERJ.sT ordered the recognizances to be estreated, a warrant was issued for the apprehension of the defendant Clark, and the trial of the other defendant was postponed to a later day of the session. Anne Cohen, 19, a respectable-looking young woAman, pleaded "1Guilty" to a charge of stealing some riband from a shop. Mr. SrGzU, whoaappeared for the prisoner, said, that she had only been married nine months to a very resecbl yoUng man, and during his abserce on business she d, unhappily, made some bad acquaintances and had contracted a desire for drlnk, and it was no doubt to gratify this shock- a propensethat she had committed the offence to which pl edguilty. It was the first dishonest act of her lfe, and he trusted that, under the circumstces, the Court would not feel it to be inconsistent with its duty to Dass a lenient sentence. The husbaud of the prisoner, who appeared to be in great griet addreaaed the Court, and said that he was a traveller, and during his absence upon one of his journeys this offence wascommitted. He said, however, that if his Lordz;p would only let him have his wife back he would take care that such a thing never happened again, for if he went on a Journey he would take her with him. (A laugh.) The Commoi-SmizmNT, in paSsing sentence upon the risoner observed upn the disgrace she had brought upon erself and her husbaud by her misconduct, and said he hopedte present proceeding wvould be a warning to her for the remainder of her life. He then Sentenced her to be imprisoned and kept to hard laboour for three months.

The June general sessions of the peace for the county of Middlese commenced this morring, at ClerkenwelL, before Mr. PASHLEY, QC, Assistant-Judge, and a bench of fhese v ere the names of 70 prisoners in the calendar, 53 of vwhom were charged with felony, and seven with mis. The ASSISTA T-JUDGB, in the course of a short charge to the jury alluded to the measure now before Parliament for the a&ojtion of grand juries in the metropolitan dierict except in certain cases and said he hoped, although it was one of the most ancient, and in some respects valuable of our instirations, the grand ury would soon be abolished in ;hi county, where it h ong ceased to be of any useful John Simpson, 42, was indicted for having stolen a coat, value 6s., the property of Joseph Weston, and two brass tape, the property of Charles Ambridge, fixed to a The prisoner had a peculiar wild exression of count.enance, and his head was nearly bald, be having torn his hairotut by the roots during his incarceration in the House The AsSITATJuDaGn said information bad been comnunioatedto him, acting upon which he should not require the prisoner to ple to the indictment, but direct the jury tobeswornto ascertainwhetherhe was in a fit state of mindtoplead (39th and 40th of George IIL, cap. 94, and .3d and 4th of Victoria cap. 54 sec. 3), The urybavingbeen sworn accordingly, fr. W*kefield, the surgeon, and Mr. John Sims, the deputy-governor of the House of Detention, were examined, and both gave it as their opinion that the prisoner was merely pretending to be mad, mentioning several aCtS he had committed upon which that opinion was formed. Itappeared that theprisonersconduct wasthatofa perfectly sane and rational man from the day of his commitment until he was informed that the officers had ascertained that he was sentenced to ten years' transportation in 183, and was therefore a ticket-of.leave man, when a marked change took plae in his demeanour leading to the inferenes that he was mad. He certainly looked like a lunatic. The Ass1STAXDJuDGOz told the jury that they would have to say by their verdict whether they considered the pnsoner to be in such a state of mind as to comprehend and know tho nature of the proceedings. Both Mr. Wakefield and the deputy governor thought he was feigning insanity, but he (the Assistant-Judge) could not see any sufficient inducement for him to do so, as the only result would be to defer the trial until he should be deemed to bein a proper condition to plead, thereby condemnlng himself to incarceration for an indefinite period before his trial on the charge brought against him. If it were a question of life or death there might be some ground for supposing that the prisoner was simulating insanity, but as it was merely a question of incrceration for a time, where could be or what could be the prisoner's motive in pretending to be mad? Taking the evidenee and the prisoner's appearance and conduct in the dock into consideration, the jury must say whether they thought him sane or not. The jury immediately found that the prisoner was insane. The COURT then ordered him to be detained in oustody during Her Majesty's pleasuze. He will be placed under proper and careful treattaent at one of the county nsylums. John Brown, 22, was indicted for feloniously breaking and entering the dwellinghouse of Joseph Hannah, and stealing therein a pair of boots.

On the S0th of May lst Messrs, -Ward and Co. were indebted to me in the sum of 211. 15s. for goods sup. plied. On that day I received a check etossed " atd Co." ror that amount on the London Joint-Stock Biank, irawn by S. Ward and Co. in favour of myself. Ireoeived it from my clerk, John Thomas Allen.

FORBEI INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (PROqI OWh' OoRoMN.) 5Aportion of theefoUowing appeared in o- _e_ond, 11lon of yester&,y-]l ITARIS, SUNDAY, JUNE 14, 6 p.U. The diandion"ainong the Democratio prty on ,the choice of cmadidates for Paris is as marked -as ever. The ;ivde set out with declaring that the cause of liberty 'which it has at heart woul1 be seriusly im.perfiled unless the fractions into which the Republicanaare split agree to fold up their respective flage-.green, blue, red, crimson, or black, as the case may be-put them into their pedkets for the moment, -ake mutal coocessions, =nd'become reconciled. It expressed its satisfaction and pride at beig able ro point to the Jotcr.7tcl des Dl)bcdvs, the organ af ihe \(0rleanAst monarchy, making, as it 'vere, common cause with it. y noing is more -noble than the oblivion ansi pardon of injury, mor more beautiful than sbo see old enemies meeting fraternally, when the meeting is sincere. ITnfortunately, this can hardly be the case in the present instance; few will believe that the Jo'ncil des Debats is serious in recommending to the Aectors of Padis M. Darimon, the pupil, the colleague, -the£riend of Prudhon, and the expounder of his terrible doctrines. It can scarcely feel sym.- pathy with the Commissary of the Republic (he was then only 20 years of age) in its wildest days, nor with the Red M. Ollivier, MX Carnot, M. Goudchaux, and others of the same stamp, on the mere chance that one of its own editors may slip in unnoticed. And are we asked to believe that the SiWcle is ianre when it proclaims in its Republican columns M. de Laboulaye, who, there is no doubt, | will, should the occasion require it, denounce in the Chamber the acts that led to the revolution of February? General Cavaignac, who figures in the same list, is a name apart. A Republican, more perhaps from family tradition than conviction, he yet served the Orieanist Government, took the oath of allegiance to it, and accepted honours and rewards from it; he did not conspire for its overthrow, and his services as Dictator of the R1epublic are considerable enough to entitle him to be made an exception. The coalition between the Debats and the Siechs has brought on the former the sarcasms of the other Royalist journals, and this day it makes a laudable, if not a successful, effort to defend itself. As to the result of the movement in Paris it is difficult to say anything. Paris, which prides itself on superior enlightenment, has sometimes elected very extraordinary people and under strange circumstances; in 1848, when the Republic burst upon the bourgeois like a thunderclap, though still frightened " at the sound itself had made," it gave Citizen Caussidibre 136,000 votes, and conferred on Citizens Proudhon, Charles Lagrange, Lamennais, and Sergeant Boichot similar marks of its affection. The Siede has done its best; it has certainly made earnest appeals to the moderation and good sense of the party, but unfortunately those appeals have not been attended to. It still, however, hopes to introduce an independent element into the Chamber. Nothing can be better than this advice, but vwill it be followed? That's the question. The Emperor invited on Friday last the seven Marshals present in Paris to meet him at St. Cloud. fter breakfast he made a trial of the small railway which runs from St. Cloud to Villeneuve l'Etang, which is intended to convey troops on campaign. The Marshals present were Reille, Vaillant, Magnan, Baraguay d'Hilliers, Pelissier, Canrobert, and Bosquet. The experiment was, however, near terminating seriously for all parties. There was no locomotive, but the waggon which goes down the slope by its own momentum, as on the descent at St. Germain, soon acquired a velocity which the breaks could not stop. A number of peasants, who were at work in the fields, or who were attracted by curiosity, uttered cries of alarm at seeing the danger. Fortunately, the waggon rushed into a ploughed field, where it was brought up. Anticipating the rumours that would fouow, the Emperor walked about St. Cloud yesterday, and went to the Vaudeville in the evening. BELGIUM. The MlIoniteur Bel4e publishes the following dooument:- "REPORT TO THE KING. * BRuSsELS, JuNE 12. "Sire,-The discussion of the Bill on Charitable Insti. tutions has been suddenly interrupted by a crisis of which our Parliamentary annals offer no other example. " All friends of our institutions regret the culpable acts which have caused disturbances in some cities of our peace. ul Belgium. " Tho adjournment of the Chambers has, most opportunely, stopped the hasty movement of public opinion; the country has had time to coUect itself, and the Government has been enabled to consider more deliberately the constitu. tional means of meeting the difflioulties and anomalies of the aase. " Now that disorder is put down and security restored, the nation confidently expects from your Majesty a measure which wiU complete the work of pacifying the public mind. " We are convinced that in the midst of the turmoil of political passions momentarily excited any Parliamentary discussion might become a source of embarrassment to the country. In this conviction we have the honour to propose to yoxur Majesty to pronounce the closing of the legislative session of 1856 to 1857. " Such a step would suspend the discussion of the Bill on Charitable Institutions. The Government will propose its adjournment at the opening of next session. "In thus acting your Ministers, Sire, obey a great duty. A witness of the sentiments of moderation and o' loyalty which have never ceased to animate the Cabinet, your Majesty has understood with -what real emotion we saw eur upright intentions misinterpreted. "On assuming office the present Ministry fonnd the question of public charities in the order of the day of the Chamber of Representatives. It was ita duty to solve it, and thereby to put an end t a permanent cause of anxiety to the country and annoyance to the Government. " How was it to be solved ? " In a country like ours, where the relief of poverty is the object of so much solicitude, we thought that, while developing labour under every shape, it was also advisable to facilitate by every means the development of charity. The BiU proposed by the Government tended to complete the salutary action of the official Board of Charity-a board respected in its principles and organization-by the supporS of foundations regulated and controlled by private charity. "This system, which is conformable to our historical traditions, which is in harmony with the laws of most nations, possessed, moreover, the merit of being perfectly adapted to the spirit of our constitution and of our organic laws. " Nevertheless, an attempt was made to detect in this BiU, which was inspired by the sole wish to improve the moral and social position of the lower claseas of society, a spirit of reaction against modern ideas and institutions. Its object, exclusivclyacharitableone, appearedtobenothingelse than a pretext to resuscitate the law of mortmain and the re-establishment of convents. The consequences were declared to be not a benefit for poor families, but a trap for rich ones. Whether from ignorance or prejudice, or from preconcerted action, the opposition to the Bil graduaUy increased it burst forth suddenly in acts of which we wish we could efface even the remembrance. " However painful it is to sacrifioe a work of conviotion and conscience, 'we understand, neverthele3s, that a prudent Government must hearken to public opinion, even when led astray by passion or prejudice. "There is the lems reason to hesitate as the interests of -the pGor, to guarantee which was the object of the Bill, will not suffer from the measare which we have the honour to propose to your Majesty. "In fact, on the one hand, the 84th article of the Communal Law, interpreted by the highest judicial authority of the country, allows the Government every latitude to authorize eharitable institutions, taking account of the intentions of the founders. On the other hand, the existing laws give to the Government the necessary freedom of action to subjeot the permimsion of those foandationa to guarantees vhich wiU insure the preservation of the patrimony of the poor and the good employment of the revenues. " Sire, the Cabinet cannot and otght not to deny it; it has a hard task to perform. Bat the very gravity of the situation contains something to challenge its patriotic de-votion. " To consolidate the reign of order aid to insnre all the d!sments of public prosperity; to maintain the integrity nusd independence of the Governsaent,iathe midsbtof party struggles; to give additional strength to the glory of the dyasty by the gratitude of the people, true appredators of the services which it never ceases to render; to guarante the regular action of all the organsof our constitutionallife; to reassure the friends of our liberal institutions, and to confotisd their calumniatore ; to make the country aware of 't real interemt, and strengthen itsfaith in the futurerzb is the mision whioh we acct , with God's blessing, (a£dWg in the wisdom of your ety, of whom we have the honour tothe the very humble, faithful, and most obedient servants, "P. DE DECKER. "VISCOUNT VILAI XV. "MB RCIE R. "ALPHONSE NOTHOMB. "GREINDL "A. DUMON." To this report the King sent the following reply " June 13, 1857. "d y dear Minister,-I have received the report of the Cabinet dated yesterday, and I hasten to give it my full approbation. In proposing the adjournment of the discussion you take an initiative which circumstances point out to you, and which the country wil understand. " I take advantage of this opportunity to address through your medium a few words to the country, which has given me so many proofs of its attachment. " A long and auimated discussion, followed by incidents wrhieh I deplore, has taken place in the Chamber of Rlepre. sentatives on a bill presented by you. " For the first timo during 26 years that I have devoted my6elf to Belgium the Parliamentary debates have given rise to difficulties, the solution of which did not at once reveal itsclf. " You have acted with the greatest loyalty and with the most perfect good faith. You are firmly convinced that the Bill, if carried out, would not produce the bad consequences wvhich have been attributed to it. I will not expresa an opinion upon the proposed Bitl I should never have consented to admit into our legislation a Bill which might have had the sad consequences which are feared; but, without entering into an examination of the BiU itself, I mnst take into account, like you, an impression which evinced itself on this occasion among a considerable portion of the population. There exist in countries which occupy themselves with their affairs rapid and contagious emotions, which spread with an in. tensity more easily discerned than explained, and with which it is more prudent to make terms (tranwiger) than to reason. " The fres institutions of Belgium have been ira operation for 26 years with admirable reguLaritv. Whet is there requisite for them to continue to work in future with the same order and the same success? " I do not hesitate to say that what is requisite is moderation aud reserve amnong parties. I think we ought to abstain from agitating any question of a nature to excite dissension in the public mind. I am convinced that Belgium may live happy and respected foUowing the path of moderation; but r am equally convinced, and I said it publicly, that any measure which might be interpreted as tending to establish the supremacy of one opinion over another is a danger. We are not wanting in liberty, and our Constitution, wisely and moderately carried out, pre. senta a happy balauce. " Hy sincere and profound attachment to the destinies of the country has given rise within me to these serious reflections. I communicate them to the country, to yourself, to the majority of the national representation. " In the circumstances in which we are now placed the majority of the Chamber, whose wishes, as a majority, are and ought to be my guide, has a noble task to perforna, a task worthy of a great party. "I advise it to renounce, as you will propose to it to do, the discussion of this Bil. It is for the majoriLty to undertake this generous part. By taking it entirely upon itself it wi give the world a high idea of its wisdom and its patriotism. It will mainhtin in its ranks the dose union which for all parties is the first fruit and the highest reward of a noble and good action performed in common. " Last year the country thanked me for my devotion; to. day I thank it for its confidence. " This letter will prove to you how happy I am to share your viewss, how much I a pprove your conduct It is my wish to watch, with you and your colleagues, over the interests of this beautiful and beloved country. " Believe, my dear Minister, in the affectionate feelings I entertain for you. "LIEOPOLD." "ROYAL DECREE.

(Countersigned) "P. DE DECKER, Minister of the Interior." AUSTRIL (I%OM OUR owN oossrNDsINr.) VIENNA, JUNE 12. The recent events in Belgium have produced a very deep impression on the Viennese, and they do not attempt to conceal the satisfaction they feel at the check which the Ultraonlatanists have received. The daily papers describe the state of public feeling in such plain language that the Cardinal-Archbishop of Vienna is very wrrath, and vows that he will complain to the highest authority in the realm of the "unbearable license" of the press. The paper which most stirsthe bile of his Eminence is the Wanderer, and he not long since sent one of bis subalterns to tell its printer, who has a shop on the ground floor of the archiepiscopal palace, that he would give him notice to quit if he did not without delay break off aU connexion with the paper. Count Bissingen, the Stadtholder of Venice, has been sent to Bologna to pay his respects to the Pope, and Count Gyulai, the Comnmander of the 3d Army, has also gone to the same city. It is stated that General von Martini, the Austrian Minister at Naples, has received leave of absence, but there is no reason for supposing that the diplomatic relations between the two Governments are likely to be interrupted. As has been said, there is a coolness between the two Courts, but there has been no quarrel. A person who has compared the Austrian and Neapolitan Concordats states that King Ferdinand II. has made even greater concessions than the Emperor Francis Joseph to the Court of Rome. A Concordat is likely to be Concluded between Baden and Rome, but it is a matter of little consequence, as the Grand Duchy is, to all intents and purposes, a Protestant country. It is stated that the State will, as heretofore, have the administration of the propeity of the Roman Catholic Church, but under the superintendence of the Archbishop. On the 8th inst. the Dowager-Empress of Russia arrived at Wildbad, where she was received by the HereditaryPrince and Princess of Wurtemberg. The latter intends to stay with her mother, who will probably pass three or four weeks at Wildbad. On the 9th inst. the King and Queen of Prussia arrived at Toplitz, in Bohemia. It is credibly stated that concessions will be mado to the Hungarians in respect of their schools and language, and that all Austrian military men who are still in prison for political offences committed during the revolution will speedily receive a full pardon.- PRUSSIA. (FrOM OUIR OWN CORarSPONDsFNT.) BBRLIN, JUNE 13. A day or two back a Mnisterial Council was held here, and attended by such of the Ministers as had not as yet left town; it was then decided that, if nothing unexpected happened, no further Ministerial meeting should take place for a month and all the Ministers have since left town. The IinisterPresident has withdrawn to his country seat for that period. From the above an idea may be formed of the correctness of a statement that lately appeared in the French papers, that the Prussian Diet was about to be convoked-shortly for an extraordinary session, for which extraordinary measure no other reason could be assigned than the necessary settlement of Prince Frederick William's appanage, a subject with which the Diet nas nothing whatever to do. A longer space of time than usual will elapse before the next meeting of the Diet, inasmuch as during the last session that clause of the charter was altered which requires the Government to convoke the Diet in November of every year, and gives them breathing-time tiU January, an alteration which they wiU gladly avail themselves of, if nothing unexpected happens, of which at present there is not even a shadow forecast. The Dresdner Journa is happy to inform its readers that the reports of the King of Saxony's having fallen ill at Stresa are without foundation. I, on my part, am happy to inform you that up to the preBent tirme, just as the post is going out, the comet has not interfered with the ordinary economy of the earth, an announcement which will not be without interest, as this is the day on which certain French astronomers had predicted the reappearance of a comet, to which popular fear and ignorance had attributed very deatructive powers and tendencies. For the present also we are relieved from the fear of being burnt up, inasmuch as within the last 24 hours the long-continued drought and heat have been alleviated by plenteous rain and excessive cold. The whole of the kingdom of Saxony and most of the Saxon Principalities were visited last Sunday by a shoek of an earthquake, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, passing from south to north, with a slight variation towards the east. The shock Iastecl several seconds, the barometer sank 5 degrees, the walls of houses trembled, and the glasses and other vessels rattled in the closets; the trembling of the earth was to such an extent as to cause the inhabitants in many cases to leave thair houses, which was the less a hardship as the sky was pexfevtly clear and the weathery fne,
THE BRL1AXiLTPAMONTAXPS B; TO THE EDITOR OF TER TIM-E S Sir,-This morning's Moniteur Belge contains a Royal decree whereby the Legislative Session of 1856-57 is delared to be closed. It also contains a letter from the Ministers to the King anda replyfrom lis Majesty. The former lament the acts which have caused so much disquiet. They declare that in the excited state of the public mind Parliamentamy discussion oould be but a sotuce of embarrassment to the country. They therefore desire to close the session, and thereby suspend the debate on the Charitable Institutions BiU. They also imdertake to propose the adjournment of that measure at the opening of the next Parliamentary session. Thus does the Government withdraw from its task; reason and common sense triumph, at least for a time. The King's reply is a remarkable document. Ie addresses himself to the oountry, which has given him so many proofs of affection. He admits the good faith of his Ministers, who were firmnly persuaded that the proposed Bill would not have the prejudicial consequences imputed to it, and adds,- "I will not pass judgment on the measuze. I sbould never have consented to give place in our legisation to a law which might have had the pernicious effect that was feared. But, without applying myself to an exaisination of the meaugre itself, I, like yourselves, observed the impression produced on this occion on a considerable part of our population. In thoe counatries which regulate their own affairs emotions arise, rapid, contagions, propagating themselves with an intensity more easy to note than to explain, and with which It is wiser to compound than to reason." His Majesty then counsels moderation and reserve, convinced that Belgium may thus live happy and respected. But, adds he,- "I am equally convinced, andI say it to every one, that any measure is dangerous which can be interpreted as tending to fix the supremacy of one opinion over the other. We have liberty sufficient, and our constitution, wisely and moderately exercised, affords a happy equilibrium. Under the circumstances wherein we are placed the majority in the Chamber-whose wishes, as a majority, are and should be my guide-has a noble part to take, a position wortby of a great party. I advise it to renounce, according to your proposition, further discussion on the law. It is for the majority to assume this generous part. By accepting it unreservedly it will afford the world a high idea of its wisdom and its patriotism. It will preserve in its ranks that strict union which, for all parties, is the first fruit and the first reward of a noble and good action Dractised in common. Lsrt year the country thanked me foi my devotion. I thank it now for its confidence." Better counsel has never been given by monarch. There is no doubt whatever that the majority in the present Chamber will accept the King's advice, and that the Bill is shelved during this Parliament. The members of the Right, to the number of 47, met last week at the house of the Count de MerodeWesterloo. MX Dechamps proposed that in the present excited s,tate of the public mnid the Charitable Institutions Bill should be withdrawn. This opinion was energetically opposed by MM. Wasseige, Moncheur, and Thibaut. However, after a long debate MIM. Malou and De Liedekerke, two of the most iniluential memboers of the majority, supported M. Dechamps, declaring themselves ready to waive the rights of the majority and to sacrifice their own feelings in consideration of the danger which threatened the country if the measure were carried. An overwhelming majority of those present adopted tQis opinion, and the Government is assured of a majority when it proposes next semsion to withdraw the Bill. Thus has time been gained, for the present Parliament is committed against the law, the Government declines to proceed with it, and the King has expressed his opinion in terms not to be mistaken. The Ultramontane journals, on the other hand, show no symptom of wavering, and denounce all compromise. The Bill, the, whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill will they have. Their political creed is expressed in these words, taken from their principal organ:-" In every well-organized society the State should be subjected to the church as the church is to God." The priests will pursue their steady course, endeavouring to " fix the supremacy of their opinion over every other." At the last election for Ghent all candidates even suspected of holding moderate opinions were violently and successfully opposedby the clericalparty, who returned every one of their nominees. Time works wonders. A miracle, indeed, will it effect should it teach toleration to the priests, independence to the peasantry. The next general election will, it may be feared, find the one bigoted, the other ignorant and helpless, as of old, and the struggle will recommence with increased intensity and bitterness. Never was task more difficult set before man than that of King Leopold. A constitutional Sovereign, he must rule by the majority of the Chambers, whose wishes, as he says, are and shaU be his guide. A wise statesman, he would govern in accordance with the intelligence and worth of the country, which are opposed to that majority, and to those by whom it is elected. A Protestant, he is chief in a State nine-tenths of whose population are Catholic, and three-fourths uneducated. The founder of a dynasty, he must offend no prejudice, consolidate his rule, and gather golden opinions from aU sorts of men. He is equal to the task, and never, in a long rule of 26 years, has he evinced more consummate tact and wisdom than during the criais now happily past. The real danger for Belgium will commence with another reign. With no wish to disparage the heir to the throne, he most certainly does not possess the prudence, the moderation, and the judgment which distinguish the Nestor of European sovereigns. He is known to have been educated by the Jesuits, and supposed to be a zealous disciple of their creed. When the power of the Executive and the opinions of the majority are centered in the Sovereign, compromise would be difficult, if not impossible. It may be hoped, however, that the Duke of Brabant has profited by the lesson of the Charitable Institutions Bill, that he will remember the counsels of his father, and that he wiUl refrain from assisting those who would fix the supremacy of their opinion over every other. While the English press has been unanimous in its views on the present question, the Imperial press of France has been no less hearty in the expression of its opinions. M. Granier de Cassagnac is foremost in the ranks of those who condemn the conduct of the King and lament the condition of the nation. With crocodile lamentations, he mourns over the fallen state of Parliamentary rule. The Belgian constitution, says he, is suspended, the legislative instrument is broken, and Parliamentary government has received its death blow- " A deliberative Assembly, unable either to discuss or to vote legislative meesures, the Municipal Council of XBrtssels usurps the rights of the Belgian Parliament, and consequently those of the nation itself. It summons the King vits address to withdraw the measure from further discuision, and the King, oppressed by this moral violence committed on his prerogative and the institutions of the country, has yielded. Thus does he sacrifice those whose duty it is to make the laws to those whose businmess it is to submit to them." The facts which serve as a. base forthese assertions, are known to the world. A meaure is proposed which causes a most pernicious excitement in the Chambers and throughout the country. Rioting occurs in the principal towns. To put an end to these tumultuous manifestations the King suspends the sittings of the Chambers, and then, in accordance vwith the ad- vice of his Ministers, declares the Legislative Session closed. It is by virtue of a formal right conferred by the constitution that the King prorogued the Chambers; it is by the same right that he has closed the session. It is for the maintenance and in the interest of this very constitution that he exercised his prerogative on both these oocasions. The municipal councils have the right by that same constitution of presenting petitions to the Sovereign. In forwarding their address to the King the corporation of Brussels exercised an unquestioned and unquestionable privilege, but before that address was voted the decree proroguing the Chambers had actually been read in the House of Representatives by ML de Decker. And thus did the Eing yield " oppressed by moral violence." Had he dissofved the national representation-had he announced his intention of governing without the Chambers-had he called out the troops and passed the Bill on charity at the noint of the bayonet; then, indeed, would the Belgian constitution have been suspended, the legislative instrument broken, and Parliarnentary government would have received its death blow. Letr M. Granier de Cassagnac take comfort. Thne Belgian constitution is in safe keeping. The Royal prerogatives are respected and intct, and the Kiing is surrounded by the respect and esteem of the entire country. I remain, Sir, your obedient servant.

After the review the Vomma;nder-in.Chief and suite returned to town. Some alterations were made yesterday in the embarcation orders relative to the 93d Highlanders and 23d Fusileers,who will leave Portsmouth to-morrow for China. 31 rank and file have been 'withdrawn from the 23d; the troops that will embark this afternoon, about 2, in the Cleopatra steamtransport, alongside Portsmouth Dockyard, will therefore be the following :-2 field officers, 4 captains, 12 subalterns, | 4 staff, 30 sorgeants, 11 drummers, and 349 rank and file.

"The French steamer Lougsor arrived from the levant on the 10th, bringing, among the otber pasSengers, Mr. F.
