THE ASYLUM for IDIOTS, Earlawood, Red-hill, Under the Patronage of tHer Most Gracious Majesty the QUEEN. SPECIAL APPEAL. Sisall there be a National Asylum for the Idiot and Imbecile worthy of the object-as equally one of science and benevolence? The Board have already received more than S00 Patients ard Pupils, and theybhave upwards of 200 now urgently craving admIssion. They have declared their readinens to mneet the urgent ocoatolo by Providing a hospital with 400 beds. Still the Boar J cannot look to do this work of mercy with safety and Prudence, except they can secure from £5,060 to £10,060, in addition to what they nonw have for the object. They submit the matter in Itse own urgency and simplicIty to a benedicent public, and eaamneetl, entreat the needful assis2tance. Shallitheylimplore in vain ? Islitnot thelalm of the day j Hau it not been too long neglected? Should not thore who hold their cloevted position In society by the energetic use of a soand mind endsa noble Intelligence, pity the idiot ? Should not the parent who, completely happy in hir children, hag escaped thins f earfunl visItation, pity aud help the idiot, at a thanks. giving to Providence? Should not the relative-the father, the mother, tho teether, the sitter-who have witnessed thin sor calamity in their eodeared conl. siealons, and yet have personally escaped, Dity, and help the Idiot?2 Should not the opulent, to whom daily gains are a daily calculation, pity the Poor Idiot, who gafins nothing, and wants everythinog? f3hould not the philanthrIopist, by preference, pity the Idiot, since the noblest benevolence is maost Interested in those who are the lowest in the scale of humanity? Should nok the Christian especially pity and held the Idiot and Imbodie, who can in no wAy help themselves, and who, because they sutfer so much, and suffer so innocently, and have so little of the worldl'. sympathy, and so much of Its scorn, have been pathetically called God's children?

ASCENT OF THE SCHRECKHORX. TO TH1EZ EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Slr,-As you have for the lazt two years published letters of mine narrating incidents of travel in Switzerland, I truut I may find equal favour on the present oecasion. On the 5th of August last I started from Grindelwald to attempt the asoent of the Schreckhorn, I took with me i Christian Alcaer, who ascended the Jungfrau with me lst, year, and Peter Bohren, as guides, and three porters, one of whom carried a ladder. We took our way along the side of the Oberberg, skirting the great glaier. Always ascending we gradually rounded the rock to the left, where the glacier spread out and rose far above us, until lost in the neve, Several beautiful waterfalls were thundering dowrn from the Icliff above, having their souroes in the snows of the Wetterhorn. In crossing just below one of these fails one of our porters had his head cut open by a stone, which disabled him for some time. In the afternoon we reached our intended resting place for the night, where was a cave in a rook with an entrance so small that a person wishing to enter was obliged to lie down on his stomach and work his way in feet first. I preferred sleeping outside on a sheepskin with a blanket over me, and my knapsack for a pillow, About 1 a.m. I was awakeneI by a clap of thunder and found it was raining, so I roUed up my bedding, and, hailing the guides inside the cave, they puled it in and me after it. When we awoke it was stiU raining. I lay alU the morning at the mouth of the hole, and, peeping out like a marmot, wistfuly eyed the Schreckhorn when the clouds drifting by allowed me to see it. In the afternoon the rain ceased and we mnounted a little higher, so as to be near the spot at which, weather permitting, we were to take to the ice on the folowing morning. At sunset I lay down to sleep under an overhanging rock, but the rain fell again and beat over me so much that I was glad to get up in the middle of the night, and, wrapping a rug round me, watch the clouds. On my left, as I eat in tantalizing proximity, rose the Schreckhorn. When a cloud' less dense thau others passed before it its outline becamo dimly visible, and at the same time showed me tha' the moon was shining brightly behind it, her light piercing the thin vell of clouds and for a moment silvering some distant mountain top with her rays. Looklng towards Thun I could mark the noble outline of the Niesen, and, as if suspended in mid air, a small sparkling light which Ifelt could be nothing else thaLn the moon shining on the lake of Thun. Anxiously I watched the flying clouds. GraduaUy thay became thinner and fewer, until at last the rters became visible, the rain Ceased, and about 2 a.m. the sky was perfectly clear and the moon shining in all her splendour. The Schreck. horn on my left and the Wetterhorn on my right stood oult in bold distinctness of ontline, the snows around them looked like frosted silver, and the distant lake of Thun waa a mirror of sparkling light. At haL' past 6 o'clock weleftour resting place. A shortdis. tance above us a perpendicular cliff of rock, with the glacier resting on it, and forming a continuation of its face, seemed to bar further progress, but at one point was a depresdion over which the glaier had flowed, and here we cut stepsm and soon found ourselves in the region above. On our light far below us was the main channel of the greatglacier, on our left far above us was a long cliff or row of iee pin. nacles, shutting La the view, and gradually bending to tho right until it terninated at a point abutting on the m>a channel. To this point we directed our steps, threding our way with some difficulty among the chasms, and, pass. ing the end of the cliff, advanced straight up the valley of snow, ending in the rocky barrier that divides the great glacier of Grindelwald from the Lauter Aar glacier. A portion of this barrier bare of snowv formed a conspicuous objoct, and we made straight for it. I now perceived for the first time that the Schreckhorn had two distinct peaks, separated by a considerable distance. I had observed it carefully, but suppose th ' from my points of view the peak nearest Grindelwald was blended with the one behind it, which is the highest. I, of course, directed my steps to the highost, and we found that unfortunately there had been an accumulation of fresh snow on and around that peak, while the lower peak being remarkably steep had scarcely any snow upon it. All round the base of the highest peak ran a crevasse, the side of which nearest to us was lower than the opposite one, and accesdble by a steep waU of snow, while from the other side of the crevasse ran a steep snow slope. After a long examination Almer decided upon a point where we should cross the crevasse. We planted our ladder and I had just mounted the waUl of snow with Almer and Bohren, when an avalanche desconded from the snow slopa above. Lucky It was for us that we had not crossed the crevasse. The largest portion of the avalanche fell into It;, but the rest poured steadily over Us, like water from a watering pot, for About half a minute. Directly Ifelt it coming I stuck the handle of my ice-axe into the snow, and held on, crouching on my knees aS low as posdble, for fear of being swept away. When it oeased I was obliged to puU my head out of my hat, leaving the latter for a moment in the snow, with large lumps of which, like hods fulU of mortar, my shoulders and back were covered. It also filed my pockets and the tops of my long gaiters, and clung in lumps to every part of my flannel clothing. We had just finished clearing off the snow when a smaller avalanche fel. Again we went through the clinging process, and then bundlod down our ladder as quickly as possible. Ajmer gave it as his opinion that if we crossed the crevasse we should dislodge the fresh saow, and be swept by it into the crevasse; end as this was quite evident, there was no resource but to give up our attempt to ascend the main peak, and I turned away disappointed enough. We now surveyed the lower peak, and as there was not any crevasse in our way resolved to try it. We first descended to the bottom of the valley of snow leading up between the peaks, and then took an upward direction, bearing to the right towards a mass of rocks forming a buttress to the lower peak, and divided frou& i' by a steep ascent of snow. We soon had another Proof of the daugerous state of the snow. Anavalauche came down sweeping a passage about 50 feet wide, and passing so close that I touched the side of the track with my axe. As it passed me its foroe was nearly spent, but our ladder man being in its way some distance below me it took him off his legs and rolled him over ladder and all, amid the laughter of the party. As quickly as posible we gained the buttress of rock, where we were safe. After climbing to its highest point about 50 steps were cut in the icy slope leading thence to the base of the peak, and then we had nothing but rock climbing to the summit, where we arrived at 3 p.m. The morning had been fine, but clouds had been gathering, which permitted us only to see our neighbour, the higher Schreckhorn peak, and the 'Wetterhorn with its conical top of fresh white snow. We planted a flag, drank a bottle of wine, smoked and chatted for some time, and then I proposed that, instead of returning the way we came, we Should try and descend the opposite side, and proceed to Grindelwald by the is ferior glacier. Almer and Bohren agreed to try, and as the porters refused to leave us we all went together, and after some terrible rough scramblingdownL the rocks, during which we surprised a chamois, which bounded away like an arrow, we reached the inferior glaeier. Then it began to rain, and by the time we arrived at the Hotel de l'Ours we were drenched to the skin. On the 21st of August, in company with Peter Borhen, I ascended Monte Rosa, which I mention only in consequence of an incident that occurred, also showing the dangers that beset travellers after a fresh fall of eno w. This had taken place five days previous to our excursion, and caused us grea' labour in getting up. In descending we wrere afraid to talus the customary glissades for fear of disturbing the fresh crust, but at lest we tried one. Scarcely had we launched ourselves off (sitting down of course) when we heard the rush of an avalanche behind us, and swiftly as we were going it overtook aud carried us along with it, and when we stopped at the bottom of the slope we were surrounded with enormous balls and lumps of snow to the height of our shoulders. I should like to have said a few words about that grand pass, the Col du G6ant, which I crossed in going from Comayeur to Chamouni, but I fear I have already made my letter too long. I cannot, however, help advising such of your readers as are fond of Alpine travelling to try the ascent of the Monarch from Mont Frety. I fancy, from observation, that the route is not so difficult as the St. Gervais one; while the scenery eannot be surpassed in grandeur. I have the honour to remain, Sir, Your most Ohmi-+ -'A EMST,kCE ANDERON >. UanrQL s, flortlake, (ct. 1.

TH?E RIGHT HON. W. BERESFORD, M.P., 12' SOUTH SSSEX. LEADEN RODING, Ocr. 1. Yesterday the annual meeting of the Roding Labourers' Friend Society was held here, under the presidency of the Right Hon. William Beresford, M.P., supported by Mr. T. W. Bramston, M .P., the Rev. W. Shepherd, and the leading gentry of the county. After the usual proceedings in the field the members and their friends dined together. In the course of the proceedings the righ' hon.PsESIDmET said, it was a source of great gratification to him to meet the farmers and their tenants on occasions like the present, and it was equally gratifying to him to know that he had the honour of representiDg that clams in Parliament, and to have watched the great progrets they had made in every depart. ment connected with the cultivation of the land. Helhad attended many meetings of that kind, not only in England, but in foreign countries, but fewv, if any, in his opinion, came up in importance to that particular one. Such societies must undoubtedly do great good; they must bring peace,happiness, and Prosperity to wRherever they were extended, and promote the encouragement of the useful science of husbandry both in the field and in the cottage; in fact, there wras no class hat was not benefitted by them. The proper development of the resources of the land was one of the highest objects to which any pera'.n could devote his attention, and the mixing of the rich with the poorer classes-the landowner and landlord, the landlord and tenant-was prolific of the most beneficial and gratifying results. The tenants were induced to pay much more attention to the cultivation of the land, which caused it to rise in value, thus enabling the tenant to go better to market, to pay his rent, to become flourishing and happy, and to catch the pleasing contagion of prosperity. There was no district in which thoseresults were more apparent than the one in which he was standing. (Hear, hear.) The attention to their own affairs and their endeavours to improve their position tended to keep the tenantfarmer f'rom the heershop, and enabled him to place on his table sihat he might designate as luxuries. He frequently tiUed his own ground, and he knew thepleasure and the advantage of adopting such a course, and he was convin^ed that nothing was so sweet as the results of one's own labour. Besides, by proper attention a man made his home happy, cheerful, and prosperous; and he trusted that while the past was very gratifying the future vvoul-l not be forgotten. There wvas nothing so salutary as a good example; the benefitNs of a good father and mother were incalculable, and produced ur,houndcd advantages to the youthful members of society, who, by force of good example, became an honour to those who had fostered them in their earlier days. By the same role the example of those moving in the higher ranks of society bad the samne effect on the tenant farmers. lie was happy to know that every rank was considered equal in their society, and that principle had been productive of the most beneficial result. There was kindness reciprocated, and it was the sympathy which existed between the higher and lower classes tlhat mnade England the great country she was. it was from the same cause that in the battlefield our arms were always attended with glory and victory (cheers), and he hoped the day would never come when as division of ranks would take p lace. In proposinR " the Army and Navy,"the right hon. BitESmuE?Xr remarked that in the most peaceful times, when the a. :vice8 of the armDy and navy were least required, the mention of their naumes always gave rise to a feeling of enthusiasm. He was confident, therefore, that at the present time, wfhen our power in India wras threatened, and so much reliance must be placed on the strength Of our arms, the mere mention Of the toast would be received with unusual marks of approbation. (Cheers.) He felt certain, when the energies of our troops and sailors were called into -requisition, nothing hut success and glory awaited them. It was plain, from all accounts that had been received from India, that the war was of a most formidable character, and, as a corroborative proof, he had only to mention that a greater number of troops were being despatched than was sent from this country at the commen cement of the Crimean war. He trusted that hostilities would soonbe brought to a term)ination, and that the results1 of the war would, by Divine P'rovidence, be a firm and lasting peace. It was a deeper and greater war than this country had been engaged in for many ye.ars. and was rendered greater and more difficult owing to the distance of its seat from our shores. The result, however, could not be doubted. Our army and navy required the cupport of all lovers of their country, * or they Ewould have to avenge the blood, not of fallen comrades, but of helpless and innocent women and children. There was one person in connexion with the subject whose name requiredl special allusion. He meant General Elave. lock (tremendous cheers), who before any great lapse of time he hoped would return to receive the weicome he so rightly merited. But all did not rest with the army, the navy must not he forgotten, for they would occupy a very prominent position in bringing the rebellion to a termnination, and it wvas with no little pleasure that he perceived that Captain Peel and 400 stanch bluejackets had, with heavier guns than had ever before been seen in the Ganges, gone to the seat of war, and he had no doubt they would make the tyrants shake in their strongholds. The toast was received with great enthusiasm. The right hon. gentleman afterwards dilated upon the advantages of the society the anniversary of which they had assembled to celebrate, and the progress it had made since its formation, the result of which, he said, was the presence that day of a happy, contented, and grateful people. They were surrounded by all classes, and nothing was so advantageous as the union of symp3thy between all ranks. They were not all peers, lords, or squires, hut they were all eqlually interested in the velfare of' the country and its farmers and husbandmen. It was, as he had previously remarked, sncb ur,ion of syrapathy that made EDngland a nation superior to any other in the wrorld. The R'ev. W. SssEs'ssEmc responded to the toast of "success to the society," and proposed "the health of t.he president." Thc Cml,sRAI,.t; briefly replied. The Riev. WV. SIIEI>sIERT,, jon., then proposed " the health of the landlords," coupling with it the name of wbr. Bramston, rhePe Sir. llocM'S'rO2, M.P., in returning thanks, remarked thai some of the most wealthy and best landlords had detived the money with which they had purchased their estates from behind a counter. There were several, in fact, of that class in the county of Essex, and he regretted he was the only landlord present to respond to that toast. The great house of Baring had the shop to thank for their peseent position of afrlyence, and that that house possessed some amount of landed property every person would ascertain who took a journey into the county of lants, where be could not move e step wtithout poking his nose into some of the Baring property. There was no chance of buying any of it, consequently the farmer was unable to advance his estate if he had a desire to do so. Lord Ashburton, who also commenced in the shop, had vast landed possessions in Hlampshire. In the midland counties, too, Lord Overstone ar,other similar example, held the greater part of the land particularly in Northanuptonahire and Bnckinghamshiren consequently the possession of land in this country was one of the highest objects of a man's life. Various other toasts followed, and the proceedings were prolonged until a late hour.
Tim ATLANTIU CABLE.-The arrangemnents for the reception of the Atlantic telegraphic cable at Keyham steamyard, Plymouth, are so far complete that the landing may be commenced next week. The spot selected is an open space between the old powder magazine and the south boundary wall of the works. On the area-161ft. by 40f. 3in. -sleepers 12in. by 6in, have been laid four feet apart, to receive a flooring of three-inch planks. The sides are to be carried 9ft. high, and the whoi3 divided into three compartments, which wrill be caulkedl and the flooas oovered with pitch, to make them watertight, for the purpose ef oCcasionally testinR the wire. A wooden roof wiU be thrown over all. The three tanks are computed to receive 3,000 miles of cable. The quantity now on board the Agamemnon is about 1,250 miles, and the Niagara has 900, but a much greater quantity will be sent offnextspring. The twoships aTe lying in the tidal basin. The discharge commences from the Niagara; the wire will pass through boiling oil, and its delivery in the ordinary way will probably occupy six weeks; after which she will go to New York for repairs. The new steam frigate Susquehanna, Captain Sands, which arrived with the Niara and Aganenmnon on the 29th of August, sailed from Plymouth on Wednesday for Spezzia, the United States' naval depot in the Mediterranean. During ber stay Captain Sands, with his First Lieutenaut Brown, Dr. Pinckney, Purser J. B. Rittenhouse, and the other officers, have been the frequent guests of the heads of the Government naval departments, and have exchanged civilities withthe inhabitants, who have beenwelcomedmost cordiAlly on board the Susquehanna while she lay in the Bound. Her return next year to assist in the effort to effect a closer union of the two nations will be haUed on all sides with satisfacUtion. Lieutenant Wells has been transferred from the Niagar to the Susquehanna. Dr. Coleman, Assistant-Surgeon of the Susquehanna, has gone home in charge of naval invalids, by the Jason, vk% Southampton,
AWZONEY-MARRET and 0ITYINTELLIGENOB. Friday Evening. The funds opened this morning with some animation, and most descriptions of securities experienced a rise, but the tone of fhfe market was then altered by a heavy sale of Consols. The first transactions were at the improved quotation of yesterday afternoon-902 to i, and, aLthough there was for some time a tendency to a further upward movement, there was ultimately a reaction of an eighth, the final prices being 90i to i for money, and 90A, to i for the new account on the 10th of November. There was not much general business, and the rate for money remained at 5 to 5! per cent. India Stock left off at 207 to 210; India Bonds, 24s. to 17s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 9a. to 5s. discount. In the discount market to-day the demand was active in preparation for the payments falling due to-morrow, which wilL be very large. A moderate amoint of business has been transacted in foreign stocks, and prices show no variation. BraziLian Five per Cents., 1843, were negotiated at 101; ; Mexican, 21i; Sardinian, 89i ; Spanish for the account, 40ffi; ditto New Deferred, 25 and J; Turkish Six per Cents. for the account, 95 and 96; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 98 and 98. n the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates were generally the same as last post. The corn-market was quiet this morning at the rates of Monday. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a steady business at former quotations. The final prices of the French Three per Cents. On the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 15c. for money and 68f. 35c. for the account, showing little alteration. At Vienna there has been a slight increase of firmness. About 28,0001. of gold was taken from the Bank to-day. It is believed that the specie shipped by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Colombo will not be much below 500,0001. Fully 35,0001. is gold for India on private account, a demand having arisen from the natives buying up sovereigns at a large premium in Calcutta, as more convenient to hoard than silver. The fact that notwithstanding several recent large arrivals of gold from Australia the stipply to meet the Continental demand has been insufficient to prevent some withdrawals from the Bank Eeems to hold out a discouraging prospect with regard to the immediate course of the moneymarket. Since the reduction of the rate of discount to 5i per cent. in the middle of July the amount held by the Bank has experienced a diminution of about 600,0001., and this decline would have been still greater if the requirements for India and China by the last two packets had not suddenly slackened. There is, however, an exceptional circumstance to account for this position and to warrant an assumption that although there are no signs of an early*turn towards a state of ease, the probability is we shall escape the necessity of a resort to measures of increased stringency. The intensity of the panic at New York has for three or four weeks past induced an almost total suspension of specie remittances from that side. In this way, perhaps, from 500,0001. to 800,0001. that would otherwise have reached us has been temporarily withheld. For some time previously shipments had been coming forward at the rate of at least 150,0001. or 200,0001. per week, and nothing had occurred to produce any material change in the relations of trade which rendered these payments due to us; but, with the rate of discount at 30 per cent, for the choicest bills, of course every American merchant availed himself as far as possible. of his credit here to delay remitting for claims which would otherwise have been provided for in due course. With the return of confidence, therefore, not only will the usual shipments be resumed, but many arrears will have to be met, and as the fortnightly consignments from California continue to reach New York the ability to meet these calls may be expected rapidly to revive. It may be hoped, therefore, that during the next two or three months our receipts from this quarter will again at least suffice, with the quantities from Australia, to keep the stock in the Bank of England from further reduction. At this moment we have the 373,0001. brought by the last Australian mail nearly due at Southampton, but there are no other very heavy amounts to be anticipated. Whether the Eastern demand will continue on the comparatively moderate scale assumed during the past fortnight depends on a variety of contingencies. Meanwhile, Austria has yet to make her final arrangements for resuming cash payments on the 1st of January, and at Constantinople there is anxious speculation as to the possibility of attracting new funds to keep the machinery of State from actually breakirg down. From both these directions our own market may possibly be influenced. On the other hand, the Bank of France, if it should resort to any extensive issue of 21.-notes may create some partial inflation. The balance of probabilities is, therefore, very even, and the conclusion is that we may remain for some time without anything to enliven or to aggravate our present dull condition. The produce Inarkets during the week have been rather active, but owing to the large supplies brought forward prices have occasionally shown wealkness. The advices by the overland mail have not caused any further material change in the leading East India staples, which, however, still attract the attention of speculators. Sugar closes about I Gd. to Is. lower for soft and inferior qualities, while good to fine grocery have met a ready sale at extreme rates. Coffee has been steadily purchased, particularly fine East India, but in plantation Ceylon there has been an occasional decJine, the public sales being very large. West India cocoa has been dulU at reduced quotations. Speculators have made very extensive purchases of rice at 3d. to Gd. above last week's rates, including several parcels afloat. To-day there was less business, but the advance is well maintained. Spices generally have realized fully former rates, excepting pimento, which is id. lower. Althongih still very firm, saltpetre has shown diminished animation. Holders do not appear anxious sellers, and the latest transactions in Bengal for arrival were at 05s. per cwt. It is difficult to buy indigo at the recent improvement, Bengal being quoted is. Gd. to 2s. dearer than at the last quarterly sales. Only a limited business has been transacted in tea ; the letters from China have not led to any change as regards prices, but have induced increased firmness on the part of holders. A few small parcels of new season's Congou have been sold during the week at 2s. 8d. to 3s. Id. per lb. Some Junk teas from Singapore at public sale on Tuesday realized good prices. Common Congou has been in request for shipment. A sale of Assam Company's tea is declared for the 13th inst. The annexed memorandum is from the United Mexican Mlining Association *' The directors have received advices from Gnanaxuato dated August 12th and 25th. In Jesus Maria the extraction of ore had been 1,900 cargas (of 3801b.) for 14 days up to the 9th, but some timbering requisite in the shaft had prevented aU the ore knocked down being raised to the surface. The interraption occasioned by the repairs had continued; the yield, however, during the four weeks ending the 29d of the month having been 3,800 cargas, of which 2,000 had been sold for $9,629;the remain,der being remitted to the Hacienda. " In the sink upon the vein of San Maximo the extremity of the level had been carried to the north with good results, showing a width in ore of four varas !33 inches), with an altitude of five varas. The works in the southern division of the mine continued to give ore in abundance, of which the fullest benefit could not be taken, owing to the necessary repairs alluded to in the shaft, the farther deopening of the sbaft being also prevented thereby. " The Haciendas of Dolores and Daran were employed in the reduction of ore from Jems Maria. " The second Raspa (or collection of deposits from the Arras'res or mills) in the Hacienda of Dolores had taken place, the result being 145 mares of plata mista (the marc of eight ounces of silver), with 1,300 grains of gold per marc, the value by the Cart: caenta, or certificate of coinage from the Mint, being $6,728. "Quicksilver was quoted at $ji65 cash per quintal of 1001b., the quantity in use and store being 15,7701b. 14oz." The return from the Bank of E3ngland for the week ending the 26th of September gives the following results when compared with the previous week:- Public Deposits £... 8,464,993 ... Increase £419,894 Other Deposits ... 9,190.690 ... Increase 188,066 Rcet . . 3,924,524 ... Increase 9,868 On the other side of the account .- Government Securities £10,593,653 ... The same as before.

RAILWAY AND MINING SHAEBS. Friday Evening. The railway-market this morning opened buoyantly, and a general advance took place: subsequently prices receded, but at the close an' improvement was maintained in Great Western, Midland, North-Eastern stocks, and South-Eastern. A slight reduction occurred in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Casadian shares were better, Grand TI runk of Canada especially advancing ll1. In French descriptions and Lombardo-Venetian there was more weakness. In American, Michigan Southern, New York Central, and Pennsylvania Central showed increased firmness. Business in the mining market was rather active, the chief variations being an improvement in Alfred Consols and a decline in Conduzrow. United Iexican were a shade higher upon the receipt of a favourable report from the works. In joint-stock banks Ottoman were slightly lower. In miscellaneous securities a further considerable reduction occurred in Canada Land, and Peninsular and Oriental Steam closed at an advance of 11. ORDTNARYV MIl A rma s nn.

Co0CUWEAL.-l81bagsln public sale went at about id. to 2d. lower; 94 bag Honduras silver, low to good, 3s. 3d. to 4L 6d.; 10 bags ditto, black, 4s. 8d. to 5s 2d. ; and 9 bags Teneriffe silver bought in at 4s. 9d.; the remainder, 68 bags, was withdrawn. TOBACCO.-No new feature was apparent througout the past month to change the favourable position of the artile from that described for some time past, and the good average amount of business transacted of a speculative nature in western strips at full prices implied confidence in the maintenance of elevated rates for this particular denomination. The operations referred to cleared the market of nearly all sampled and in first hands, and as the small quantity of the new that will son be in course of samplina and at the disposition of importers can neither exercise any important influence in prices nor afford the good assortment held by speculative parties, the time is not far distant when the demand will have to be supplied from second hands. The two cargoes lately arrived from New Orleans complete the importation till the autumn of 1858 of western leaf and strips from that quarter, and no other cargo than the T. L Bogers, just arrived with 862 hhds. and tierces (not included in the stock) Is expected from Vlrginia. The annual statement from New Orleans shows the receipts to have been 1,023 hhds. less than during the former year. The shipments to Great Britain have been 3,915 hhds. in excess, and to the North of Europe 1,70 hds., but to France and the South of Europe 14.064 hhds. less, and the stock Ist September lastwas 4,586 hhds. more. The deficiency in the receipts in Virginia is likely to be 12,000 hhds., but as the accounts are made up there one month later, the exact falling off caunot yet be ascertained. The inspections in Baltirmore have beeu 367 hhds. less, and the exports 933 hhds. less than at the same date last season. The reports of the growing crops in Virginia are conflicting, but in the Western States (except Missouri) they continue favourable for a good yield with propitious weather during the remainder of the season. The arrvals were L382 hhds.; the deliveries 845 hhds., leaving the stock 10,111 hhds., or 1,436 hhds. more than at the same period last year. Havannah Leaf.-On account of an opinion gaiing ground that the supplies of the new crop to come forward would be inferior in quality, a large business in the old was transacted at full rates. Cigars were it fair demand. Paraguay.-Large opeations of a speculative nature were entered into; the trade also bought freely of that which was fine. Supplies shortly expected. Brl in more demand; a parcel of 250 bales will shortly be placed on the market, and about 1,500 bales expected, but whether for transhipment or not is undocided. Yara and Cuba.-The only parcel offering of the former was taken for exportation; 250 bales have just arrived. Of the latter the stock is small. Columbian continues dull of sale, ari from the high price demanded and the inanimate state of the forelgn markets. Manillra-2,931 bales arrived per Eale, principally for transhipment. Cheroots. -306 case arrived per Eagle, and in consequence of the large supplies there is for the moment an absence of buyers. Turkey in fair demand; about 3,500 bales have arrived. Greek.- Rather more in demand; fine coloury descriptions would meet ready buyers. Dutch aud German.-Fine descriptions meet ready sale at full prices. Negrohead and Cavendish continue in good demana. Smalls dull of sale. Stalks not inquired after.

LONDON, SATURDAY, OCTOBBR 3, 187. The long-expected interview between the Sovereigns of FRAS CE and RUSSIA has now taken place. The details have been read by those of *s who can feel an interest in anything which does not concern the position of our Indian Empire. :Brilliant equipages, fine uniforms, visits t- the COpera, and dinners on a magnificent scale have delighlted the assembled guests at Stuttgart; but the meeting itself, though held just fifty years after Tilsit and on the anniversary of Erfurt, will hardly recall, except by contrast, those celebrated interviews. If anything were required to prove the advance which Europe has made in intelligence and political morality, it is the Esmall results which follow from the schemes and purposes of even the most powerful rulers. We cannot help feeling that the more the world at large learns, and thinks, and acts, the less becomes the influence of the individual statesman. In Eocict:es wbere knowledge is confined to a few and :ireedom possessed by none, a master spirit may xnse up and change the course of a nation's destimies. The warrior, the orator, the theorist, stands Uigh above his fellows, moulda their habits, directs their instincts, and descends to posterity with a vast reputation. But as communities advance such commanding eminence becomes more difficult and well-nigh impossible. The light is too great for any man's torch sensibly to augment it; the tide is too broad and strong to be diverted into a new channel by any man's effort. Kings become merely the representatives of their subjects' nationality-Ministers the administrators of their countrymen's policy, and the interpreters of their wishes. In England, where this principle has been longest and most fully at work, power has descended from the Crown to the Cabinet, from the Cabinet to Parliament, until the real debating and resolving on great measures seem at last to have settled in the people at large. The nation is its own Holuie of Commons, aud the House of Commons its own Prime Minister. And it is well for the peace and security of the world that it should be so. The more great political acts depend on the united opinion of large bodies, the less liable will be the macline of State to be influenced by the errors, the caprices, or the crimes of individuals. lWhat has been going on in Englaud has had its counterpart on tho continent of Europe. In spite of Socialist outbreaks and despotic reactions, in spite of subverted constitutions and censor-guarded presses, tho people of France and Germany are in no small degree the arbiters of their own fortunes. They read, and talk, and think, and min,le in all the concerns of life, even though the Chambers be closed and the press gives but an uncertain sound. They have the book of history open, and may learn what have been the consequences of former wars, whether of religion, or national hatred, or Royal ambition. They have also before their eyes the results of 40 years of peace. Railways uniting their great cities, steamboats on their navigable rivers, ports on the German Ocean or the Mediterranean doubling their tonnage and growing up into first-rate cities, cotton factories and silk factories dotted about over whole provinces,-these are the objects which meet them on every side. There are old men among them whose lives Ilmust have been divided into two periods as unlike each other as the death's-head profile is from the living profile on mediEeval carvings. Such men may well compare the year of Tilsit with the year of Stuttgart. Their yoath and prime of manhood were passed amid calamities of which their grandchildren have often heard the story. On both sides of the Rhine they may furnish the cottage legends of invading armies extending for scores of miles and carrying off everything in their way; of uncultivated fields, ruined villages, whole populations of women and young boys-the only leavings of the conscription-eating mouldy bread and boiled nettles for want of better food, and pursuing every traveller with a dismal wail of supplieation. In each country they may preserve a vivid recollection of military rule,-the hostile garrisons, with their strange language and lawless habits, the fierce commandants ever hanging and shooting for breach of regulations, the insecurity of female honoiur, the paralysis of all honest exertion, the mutual suspicion, the suspension of social intercourse, the treachery, and ihe moral degradation of that gloomy time. Tbey may remember their captured capitals, the blowing up of their bridges, the spoliation of their museums, and all the other humiliations of the conquered. Wl;ith such memories will Tilsit and Erfurt be associated by the contemporaries of the old KING who has been the host at Stuttgart. W0'hen we compare the lot of the present generation with all that has been suffered by the men who are now passing away, wve feel that there is little fear that Europe should be unable to judge between good and evil. It is therefore not to be wondered at that a meeting of potentates should in the present day have a diminished importance. The nations of Europe are able to express their opinions, though nob in constitutional forms; and the most striking fact of the age is the plain and unconc-aled predilection of the continental nations for peace. France in 1855 was found, to the astonishment of the world, to have no appetite for glory. The exploits before Sebastopol created actually less enthusiasm at Paris than among many distant and umconcerned nations. As for Germany, it is pretty certain that she will never undertake any but a purely defensive war. Peace, then, being for the future the probable condition of Europe, the schemes of Sovereigns must be bounded by a very diminished sphere. They may agree to support certain Ministers in certain petty States, to repress or encoiurage certain ideas, to tighten or relax a passport system, to increase or lessen customs and duties in common; but beyond their own subjects and the subjects of some weak States their influence will be but limited; and even -where they rule their power Is, in the present state of Europe, not complete. France and Germany, and even Russia, must move in obedience to laws over which no man, or body of men, has control. The highest deliberations of Kings and statesmen must now relate only to matters of arrangement and detail. 'Vhile, then, we must regard the present and all simlilar interviews as of no great and durable importance, it is yet undoubted that the personal relations of the rulers may be improved by them, and thus a more cordial 1Understanding exist between the Courts of Europe. Where people have to correspond it is certainly am advantage that they should be aequainted and know something of each other's characters and tempers. We may, doubtless, expect from these gatherings of Sovereigns a facilitation of the transaction of Eiuropean business which is not undesirable. This result will also probably be advanced by the ascendancy which the French Exii,ERoR wil obtain over his legitimate brethren. If the accounts we receive are accurate, NAPoIEoro III. has no cause to regret having shown himself on neutral ground in company with his Northern rival. In genius, in manners, in affability, in all that commands respect and conciliates esteem, the French EDPERoR manifested his superiority ; and if it be true that the Empress of RUSSIA condescended to deception in order to put a slight on the CONSORT of NAPOIF-N, it is probable that the incident wiU only lessen Mus- covite influence with all beyond the narrow circle of German royalty. The position of the French Eumunoit is now one by which any ruler might be elated. He has achieved a double tsiumph; he has extortel fraternity from military despots, and conciliated gocdwill from a free people. He has been successfiul in war, and yet is looked upon as the main upholder of peace. Whatever may be the instincts of the old race of Kings they have been one by one obliged to accept him as an equal, and any want of grace in the act has only added to their own humiliation, as showing that their pride has been unwillingly sacrificed to their interests. It is as the final triumph of NAPOLEON III. that the Stuttgart meeting is chiefly remarkable. In other respects it is, perhaps, of less importance than the interview between ALExNADER and FRANCIS JOSEP:U. Here, indeed, a work of great interest may be accomplished-the reconciliation of the estranged Courts of St. Petersburg and Vienna. This consummation no one more heartily desires than ourselves. When Turkey is secure and the Moldo-Wallachian question settled, the hostility between Russia and Austria can only tend to impede the progress of both. We English do not enter into all the niceties of continental politics3 we see things from a distauce and mnerely in the grosa; but our feeling is that a good personal understanding between all these proud and punctalious rulers is the best means of delivering Europe from the incubus of armed preparation which now presses on its energies.
*Sir CHURMS NAPIzP iS alWays amusing, and no man was ever amusing without being instructive. With unconscious instinct he is playing a useful part, and rendering to his country that service which his own element deniies. He represents the pent-up, thwarted, crossed, half-blighted energy of our race, and so starts the grand question how to give it free vent and turn it to good purpose. He wants to be at Lucknow or Delhi, with anybody to back hiim-with 4,000 Bury artisans if he cannot have sailors or soldiers. That is everybody's feeling wherever you go. Our continental neighbours taunt us witlh not sending out volunteers, but they forget, first, that our whole army and navy are volunteers; then, that those people who have not embraced these professions have generaly something else to do by this time; then, that HER MAIJESTy'S Ministers do not offer much encouragement to this sort of service, and most men fuid the thing simply impossible. Yet we should all like a little fighting, and we long to be there, and fancy to oiuraelves how ve should do it, if the laws of space and time and a few other conditions would be rather more accommodating. Of course we have our families, our estates, our patients, our clients, our customers, our parishes to attend to; and some of us are too old, too lame, too blind, too short-winded for work. The general fate of old offices is not encouraging. How should we stand those sun-strokes, those marches of 25 miles with the glass at 120, those bivouacks on marshy ground, those crossbelts, those knapsacks, and HEAvEN k;nows what besides ? Were it not for these things we, too, would be soldiers. As for sailors, their case is particularly hard just now. They cannot get a chance. Even when the contest is between sea and land they find themselves obliged to wait for orders from the land, or land only to find themselves fish out of water. But there is not even this amphibious character about the Indian mutiny. It is in the heart of a great continent, separated from the sea by a thousand miles of cataracts, sandbanks, and deltas of mud. The idea of turning the British navy to account in this region never entered the head of a First Lord, and scarcely occurred anywhere, except at Astley's, where a middy and his boatswain are now nightly invading harems, rescuing Hindoo maidens, and-absit omen-restoring hereditary princes. But a new era is dawning on the navy. Captain PEEL is now working up the Ganges with 400 bluejackets, and we shall live to see a combination of idees only equalled in OVrD's description of fishes swimming through the branches of trees and stags cresting the ocean wave. Perhaps it is this that has fired Sir CHARLES'S ambition. Indeed, we would give something to see him started up the Ganges with half-a-dozen steamers as stiff, as well armed, and as well manned as their draught would allow, and unuer no vexatious responsibility to the Admiralty, or the Board of Control, or the GovE?NxoRGENERAL in Council, or the Commander-in-Chief, or anybody but the British public, who never forgive shorteomings, and regard the most culpable rashness with respect or compassion. But why should not the volunteer system be applied to the navy? WVhat encouragement will be given to any English gentleman who will properly equip a little steamer, take her up to Allahabad, and thence proceed on any service that may be required ? As for the gunboats of HEa MVJEsry's navy, it is the old story-they either draw too much water, or carry too little coal, or they are leaky, or their boilers are rusted through, or they make no way against a current, and the result is they are now everywhere except where they are wanted. But cannot the Royal Yacht Club turn their energies and their money to some better account than tacking across the Channel or going round and round the Mediterranean ? It is true that, accorling to Indian authorities, the game will be over in May; but nobody can be sure of that, and even if it be so, a few such volunteers might arrive i'i Central India in time to finish up the work. We shall not have a man too much, or a gun too much, or a boat too much, in India next May, for some great deeds of justice and humanity are then to be done, and an imposing force will be required. It is, too, quite evident that we never learn anything in this country except by the slow, costly, painful, and ever imperfect process of experience. The art of river warfare is in its infancy. We have no rivers here to call out our talents in this respect. We have had naval reviews, and land reviews; grand promenades out to sea at high tide, and grand promenades across commons and heaths in dry weather. Let us have next an amphibious review-a battle of gunboats with land forces, in the most rapid, most shoally, most shifting, most generally chaotic piece of river navigation in these isles. There ought to be a few muddy creeks and treacherous bars, and enough play of current to test the power of the engine, the crew, or the helm. It must be considered that within the last twelvemonth we have been at war with nearly all Asia, which does not possess a single maritime Power, and for the next hundred years will not give occasion for the services of a single frigate, except as a dep6t or the residence of an Admiral. But Asia has plenty of rivers-rivers that periodically become inland seas, and that are, in fact, the highways of great nations. If we are to maintain our ground in Asia-if we are to fulfil the responsibilities which we have already undertaken in those regions, and if we are to use our navy and economize our army, we ought to have an entirely new description of armament for the purpose; and a few volunteers, even if they find notLing else to do, may show us the way. Remember, when India is over China comes on. Perhaps Sir CHARLEs, who laments so keenly the abeyance of the navy at this juncture, as well as its forced inactivity in the last war, can offer some suggestions as to the employment of our sailors, and the kind of craft suited for river warfare. We wil venture to smy that CFsAR, who was an Admiral as well as a General, and a first-rate engineer besides, would have had a very suitable and effective armament by this time on the Ganges, the Jumna, the Goomtee, the Gogra, the Soane, aud all the rest of them, now invested with anything but glorious associations. The art of war consists in a perpetual adaptation of the meaus to the end; and as war is ever changing its methods, its scene, its weapons, and even its men, nothing can be done without always keeping up with them, and running a race of invention. For any country of Asia, where our vocation now appears to lie, our big sbips, our three-decker., and even such perfections of art as the Duke of Wellington or the Agamemnon, are as useless as the canoes of the South Sea Islanders or the coracles of our British ancestors. We shaU live to see a hundred of them rot a' their moorings, without doing any service except adding a thousand or two to the "Sale of Old Stores" in our financial returns. We have had a few " cautions" lately as regards the size of our vessels even at open sea in the treacherous navigation of the East rn hemisphere. One of HER MAJESTY's frigates has touched a rock and gone down at the mouth of the Canton river; and five big transports have touched the ground in the Straits of Sunda or thereabouts, one of them to her cost. It is obvious there cannot be equal danger with vessels of less draught. Let big sbips be used in their place. in the open Atlantic the Great Eastern will be a floating island, and as steady and safe as where she now stands. But happily for small people, for small capitalists, young officers without friends, and generally the risina generation, in a large part of the ocean, not to speak of the rivers, you get soundings, every now and then, at twenty, fifteen, or ten feet. There must be craft adapted to this moderate depth, and people must be found small enough to take charge of that craft. Such is one way in which small people get a chance, though the big people gruidge it, and would deny it if they could. Give them a chance on the Ganges and its tributaries. See what can be done. How long is the British navy, the Acaiu.s of modern warfare, to be sulking in harbour, because work cannot be found grand enough for its dignified proportions ? Help us, Sir CIARIEM, out of this ridiculous position. You say you asked for gunboats when you -vent into the Baltic, and were refunqed them. Be so good as to tell the Board of Control and the Admiralty what is now to be done.
The competency evinced by the Government of India to grapple with the exigencies of a crisis like the present has naturally been the subject of keen discussion on the spot. and has been debated with some earnestness at home. To the general conclusions of Indian opinion on such a topic it would be reasonable to attach much weight, but the acrimony excited by the restrictions laid upon the press is so great as to leave little room for impartiality of judgment. The points most angrrly disputed concern the estimate formed by Lord CA-i?wiuG and his advisers of the perils in view, and it is alleged that they were disposed, in the face of what ought to have been convincing evidence, to underrate the danger, to depreciate the magnituide of the crisis, to neglect the resources at their command, and thus eventually to aggravate the horrors of the catastrophe by wilfully or weakly dissembling its proper character. To some extent the views thus imputed are so consistent with the propensities of human nature that we may assent to the probability of the charge. The ordinary members of an Indian Administration must necessarily have been reluctant to believe in a revolt which not only carried with it a certain condemnation of the policy they had pursued, but ihreatened an entire revolution of the system from which they derived their power, and they would be likely to close their minds as long as possible to convictions so thoroughly unwelcome. At the same time it is but fair to remark that the true character of the spirit which has now been developed in a dreadful and comprehensive rebellion was long unappreciated even by those most intimately acquaiDted with the Sepoys and their opinions. To this minute it is doubted by some of the best informed of our correspondents whether the insurrection which has Bactually embraced an entire army was originally organized or conceired in any such dimensions, and it has probably not escaped the observation of our readers that the very persons who condemn the Government of India for not recognizing at once a monstermutiny in the first revolt at Meerut affirmn in the same breath that the whole rebellion would have been stifled at its birth Hf the European force on the spot had but been vigorously employed in intercepting the revolters in their flight to Delhi. It is clear, however, that if this view of the case is to be accepted, the presumption of a mature, determined, and universal conspiracy against our power must be abandoned, and that it has been due only to the fortuitous operation of events that the expectations of partial and limited disturbance have been overthrown by the terrible realities of a prodigious insurrection. It must be rernembered that the Administration of Bengal included no machinery whatever for the discovery of a plot. We had no detective police, nor were any officers employed by the Government to keep it informed as to popular designs. We lived and ruled in Hindostan with a confidence as secure as that which pervades our Administration at home. Since the outbreak of the insurrectionary spirit an Intelligence Department is spoken of at Bombay as materially assisting the resolutions of the Govermment, but there appears to have been no espionage in Bengal, nor do we see, indeed, to what advantage it could have been practised when the best authorities proved so utterly deluded and the best sources of information so worthless. The very officers of the mutinous battalions, from the Colonel to thejunior Ensign-the men whose own lives would be the first and immediate forfeit in the event of error-persisted to the last in affirming that they knew their troops and that their loyalty was beyond suspicion. If a Government could not place reliance on communications like these, it is hard to see how the machinery of the State was to work at all. Judging by the event, we can certainly now discover that the first symptoms of a mutinous spirit at Barrackpore and Morshedabad portended worse evils than were anticipated, and that, if the force at hand was sufficient for the support of authority at such a crisis, it would have been better to cut down the revolters as they stood. We are by no means sure, however, that the GovERNOR-GExERAL would have escaped censure or obloquy by the adoption of such a policy. If the example had actually sufficed to deter others from insurrection, its necessity would have been called in question from this very fact, and those who recollect what Lord TORRINnGTOrxS igour cost him at Ceylon will doubt whether any agreeable consequences would have been in store for Lord CANNING. But if the measures adopted by the Indian Government were as prompt and energetic as they could be, it seems of comparatively little importance what parxticular c&aracter was ascribed to the crisis before it, and here we are at some loss to understand what shortcomings can be laid to their charge. When the revolt was once declared in its full proportions, the one great duty of Govermuent consisted in procuring forces to resist the rebellion; and this function itself was soon resolved into the collection of every European battalion from every quarter where a despatch could reach it. There were ns native levies to be raised in Bengal; all that work had to be accomplished in the Punjab, where it has been pursued to such good purpose by Sir Jonx LAWRE^NCE that upwards of 30,000 trusty and stalwart auxihlaries may be expected to take the field with us by the close of this year. Nor was there much for the Government to do in the camp before Delhi, for the basis of these operations was not Calcutta, but Lahore; communications with the South-East were interrupted, and one Commander succeeded another by the rules of the service. Lord C<AxruNruG's business was to get troops as fast as possible, and to despatch them with all speed to the North-West. This he did with such effect that we do not know of a single source of succour which was overlooked. A bare recapitulation of facts is enough to show the diligence which has been exerted. The soldiers with which HAVELOCK, fought his way to Cawnpore were brought partly from Madras and partly from Bombay. Half the troops who marched against Arrah had been fetched from Ceylon, and of the two regiments now ascending the Ganges to the assistance of &cv oI jibe, Kelief of thOin one camre from the Mauritius, and the other was intercepted on its way from these shores to China. UTnless the erroneous views attributed to the Indian Government are to be detected in the representations transmitted to Ministers at home, we do not see where to look for the results of the misconception. The authorities of Calcutta were probably slow of belief and possibly mistaken in their conclusions, but if 20,000 men are landed in India by the middle of next month, and 10,000 were gathered from various parts of the globe before their arrival, it is hard to imagine how the most accurate perceptions of the truth could have produced results of greater practical service. It is not to be supposed that if a crisis like this could have been foreseen the selection of an officer to encounter its emergencies would have fallen on Lord CA-NNNG, or that his Lordship himself would have been desirous of a post in which the attributes of splendour and diguity would be overwhelmed by the responsibilities and perils of a most arduous command. In the position in which he unexpectedly discovered himself, if he has not displayed the intuitive genius of a CLIVE for government and conquest, he has shown abilities not entirely unequal to the occasion. His principal opponents do not deny him the credit of unimpeached integrity and undoubted courage, and if his policy has bitherto expressed the views of his Council rather than his own, that is an inevitable incident of our Indian system. The truth is that the -whole of this system needs reform. It involves a complicated and cumbrous machinery of administration, but no real or individual responsibility, and consequently no genuine power. The President of the Board of Control represents one species of authority, the Court of Directors another, and the Governor-General in Council a third. It is difficult to determine where any course of policy should originate, and it naturally results sometimes that none is originated at aU. Under such conditions of office the sympathies of the public are likely to go with Lord CAN-rxo, and as a single test, indeed, of his success under difficulties it is something to say that ho has encountered the full force of that terrible shock which it was always predicted would shiver our Eastern Empire into fragments, and that though he has not up to this moment received the aid of a single soldier from England we remain the lords of India still.

TRoors FOR INDIA BY TEE OVERLAIND ROUTE. -SoUTHAMtPToN, Friday, Oct. 2-The first body of tIoops that have embarked from this port for the scene of the Indian mutinies left here to-day in the Sultan steamship, one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's fleet, Captain Nell Cook, in which vessel they wiU proceed as far as Alexandria, and thence go across the Desert to Suez. They consisted of the 4th and 11th companies of the Royal Engineers, which left Chatham this morning, arrived here per South-Westsrn Railway about half-past 11 o'clook, and marched immediately on board the Sultan, which lay alongside the dock wharf. There were in aU 235 non-commirsioned officers and men, and 13 offl;ers. The namnes of the officers who embarked are as follow :-Captaln Thomas Fenwick, In command of the whole body ;Cantatn Cumberland; Malo rL.Nicholson; LieutenantsD. CWaiker, Beaumont, J. E. P Patterson, Maquay, Seratchly, E. E. Wynne, W. Keith, and Sweetenham; Dr. Brown and Dr. Haversty. The men marched with only their sea-kits in tbeir haversacks, all arms, knapsacks, &c, having pre viosly been packed in cases and stowed away on %oa-rd. The 4th company is destined for Calcutta, and the 11th for Bombay. Colonel Harness, we understand, is to join them at Malta. The embarcation was superintended by Colonel Gordon, Deputy-Adjrtant-General of the Engineers, who came from London for tho purpose; and there were alse present Colonel Wright and Colonel Dalgetty, from Portsmonth, nd other officers. The arrangements had been so weU made beforehand by Captain Engledue (Peninsular and Oriental Company's superintendent) and the dock officials, that within hsaf an hour from the arrival of the troops they were all safely honsed on board, and the Sultan moved away from her berth, affording another iUnstration cf the great facilities provided at this port for such purpossa. A large number of persons were assembled in the do^k to witness their departure The direcetors of the Peninsular and Oriental Company bve sent out a gentleman from their establishment her, named Moser, author of VTe Caucsns, and who saw a get deal of similar seioee in the Crimes during the late Russian war, to accompany the soldiers to Egypt, and superintend thelr transit across the Desert, for the purpose of attending to the comfort of the men. THE UNINTED STATES FRIGATE: PL-MOTm.-Mr. William Thomson, the UnitiaB States Consul at Soutbamp. ton, paid an official visit t, the above-named frigate, now lying in the river off that town, yesterday afternoon, previous to her departure fo Amenos The houn gentleman was accompanied by a lbw friends, who were hospitably entertained by Capta1n.

LATEST INTELLIGENCE. GENERAL HAVELOCK AND THE MUTINEERS. The following telegram, which contains more precise intelligence respecting the latest operations of the force under General Havelock, was received by the Bombay Government from Poona on the 31st of August:- "W Ve have news from Cawnpore dated the 18th inst. On the 16th General Havelock engaged the rebels about 12 miles from Cawnpore. Two guns were taken. Captain Mackenzie and 15 men were wounded; none killed. " The troops were very hard worked. The cholera was bad; 14 men and Lieutenant CampbeU, of the 78th Highlanders, had died of it. " The last accounts from Lucknow were dated the 14th of August, and reported 'all well."' THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN LISBON. The following telegram vi-as received yesterday from Lisbon by the Portuguese Legation:- " The epidemic has not spread in Lisbon to any extent. Up to this dcy the general daily mortality has never ex. ceeded 33. The fever has appeared with some intensity in two parishes only."
AMEICA. (By ErLCYRIC A&D BMZRINTIOWAL TELDGRAPH.) SOUTHAMPTON, FITDAY EvxrNxG. The United States' mail steamship Arago, Captain Lines, has arrived off Cowes with two days' later advices from New York. This steamer brings details of the total wreck of the Central America steamer as follows:- BALT131OTE, Sept. 19. The boat which left Norfolk yesterday evening arrived here this morning. The agent of the Associated Press boarded her last night from the afternoon boat, and came up here with several of the passengers of the Central Americr.,-Captain Badger, of Baltimore, furnished him with some interesting facts. List of those known to be lost:-William Lee, Canada; Benjamin Colt Hancock, county Ilinois; Hanson and John Herne, MIissourie; Richard Wilton Quincy, IlUinois; James E. Burch, United States' mail contractor, FaU River; Gabriel Brush, baggage master, New York; Charles Taylor, North Carolina; Samuel Shrive, San Francisco; Dr. Byanni, ditto; Dr. Gibbs and Mr. Marin, California; Mir. Parker, San Francisco; Mr. Booker, Boston; Purser Dobbin (brother of the late Secretary of the Navy), North Carolina; 31r. White, Sacramento; Purser Hull, of the steamer Central America, New York; Mr. Hull (brother of the purser), San Francisco, California; Mr. Van Rensaliaer, first officer of the steamer; Captain W. L. Heredon, United States' Navy, commander of the steamer; and James T. Tennison, doctor of the steamer. The Norwegian bark, at Norfolk, is the bark Ellen, Captain A. Johnson, from Belize, EHonduras, and not the bark Eloise, as was reported. Oliver P. MIailur, a Dassenger, gives the following information:-"The storm commenced immediately after the steamer left Havannah, increaming until Friday. On Friday afternoon aU hands were called up to bale, the vessel continued to ship water, and aU hands worked with buckets, barrels, Ac., all Friday night and till about 2 o'clock on S2turday, when the brig Marine hove in sight; all the ladies and children were put on board the Marine about G o'clock p.m., and the chief engineer left with them. In launching the boats two of the five of them were stove, and the other three were despatched with the women and children about an hour before sunset. The arline was lying nearly a mile off, and by the time tho three boats reached her it became evident that the ship must go down before they could get back. AIl hands then seized pieces of spars, chairs, and life-preservers, while others rushed belowv to secure their treasure. The confusion now became great, though all acted with coolness, each endeavouring to make the last effort for his own safety. Now the vessel gave three Ilrches, some of the passengers jumping off at each lurch; those -who jumped off at tie first and second lut ches swam off to some distance, but the great mass remained on deck until the vessel went down, which was a minute or two afterwards. I had provided myself with a life-preserver and a piece of a spar, and determined to go down -with the vessel with the great mass of the passengers; aU of them stood about bracing themselves up and securing those articles most available to buoy them up. The vessel finally went down, stern foremost. I was standing near the smokestack at the time, and we were aU dragged inder tlhe water with the sinking ship. The general supposition is that we were all drawn iunder the surface at least 20 feet, and when we rose we were nearly stifled; the rapidity with -which I was drawn down tore the spar from my hands and the life-Dreserver from my body, and when I reached the suirface my clothing was aU stripped off me. I however met a friend who had two life-preservers, who gave me one, and we also seized on pieces of the wreck,which helped to sustain uls. About 400 of the passengers were struggling about, most of them having lost their life-preservers, and others remaining on pteces of the wreck, which came up with us. The boatswain had cut away the upper works of the vessel, go that when the hull sunk they would float off, but they were dragged down, but came up in fragments. Many persons were killed, stunned, and drowned by being struck with pieces of the wreck, while the pieces were to others the ultimate means of safety, and occasionally a flash of l;ghtning showed to each other a sea of struggling foi.s Each strove to encourage his friend with hopes which he scarce felt himself. At first we were all together in a mass, but soon the waves separated us, and at each successive flash of lightning we discovered that we were being scattered over a wide area, and soon found ourselves apparently alone on the boundless ocean. The rest of this account does not differ from that already received. He concludes by saying about 10 o'clock he was picked up by the bark Ellen, and had the satisfaction of finding others on board her. The steamship Empire City left Norfolk yesterday at 11 o'clock a.m., with many of the rescued passengers. The Arago brings 85 passengera, mails to the 19th, $27,000 in specie, and 4,000 bushels of wheat, all for Havre. Among her passengers are the Hon. B. F. Angel, Minister of the United States to Sweden, and family ; the Hon. S. BiUe and family; the Hon. T. BiUe, late Charg6 d'Affaires of Denmark to the United States ; and Mr. Y. G. Durand, bearer of despatches to Paris. September 21, at 8 a.m., in lat. 41-35, long. 66S30, sawr a ship rigged propeller bound NV.

A large meeting, prineipally of Irishmen, vwsheld at New York on the evening of the-lTth to express opposition to British enlistments in the TUnited States for the war in lndia and sympathy with the Sepoy mutiny. The secretary of the U nited States' navy, on hearing that the laying of the Atlantic cable had been po-tponed till nest year, oAdered the Niagara to return to New York and the Susquea..a to join the home squadron. Captain Joaiih. Tatnall has been appointed to tAe command; of the American. squadron in the Chinese waters..

A WORD FROM A SHOPMA N. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. 6iir,-A very cruel attack has been made upon us shop. 'men as a class. The unrivalled povers of ridicule which you possess have been brought to bear upon us; your unrivalled circulation has raised a laugh s-ainst us through. out the world. W e are asked why we do not enli.t as private soldiers, and hurry to avenge our slaughtered fellow-countrymen and women and children in India. Our employment is derided as unmanly-as the province of women rather than of meD. Yet we are a hard-working class of men, Sir-up early and late, on foot all day, very weary towards night. Oar avocation demands strength, activity, sound health, neatness, care, patience and good temper, and a fair education; and by the exereise of these qualities we most of us hope to rise in the coarse of time to hlgher, more lucrative, arod more independent positions. Why should we enlist, then? Why should we lower ourselves in the social scale and congregate with the illit2rate and debaucbed crew which the recruiting sergeant is now collecting from the dregs of the population ? tSuch, if I am not mistaken, is the description recorded by the great Duke of Wellington of the classes whioh compose the rank and fie of the British army. If we are to be reviled for not joining in such ranks, are not the yeomen and the middle clamses of Englishmen all open to the same censure, for they too, scrupulously abstain from enlisting? And has there been any very disinterested example set us as yet by the -Young nobility and gentry? What have they yet done for England and India at the present crisis ? There scarcely seems to be the usual scramble for staff appointmonts to India among the upper classes. Our trade is one which ought to be in the hands of wouienso you say. Women's labour is cheaper than men's, therefore I suppose that if our employers thought women could serve them as well as we do their feelings of self-interest would promiipt them to employ the! cheaper instead of the dearer servants. It you thought women could emoipose your celumns as well as men,you would surely enmploy then; but you do not think so, therefore you employ men. Be fair, Sir, and concede to our employers that free choice which you reasonably demand for yourself. The tr,,th is that our avocation is we:risome and unhealthy work. Our employers employ as mauy women as they can, but they cannot get their work done and done well, in hot rooms, with long hours, save by young and vigorous men. We do not enlist, Sir, because a l;'e spent in the ranks is not a sufficient temptation for us, and because we are told by you, who ought to know best, that if, by extraordinary courage and merit, we win commissions, the pay is so small 'as to render the prize a blank, while the prospect of further promotion aecording to merit is-zero. There are few trades or callings, not requiring great bodily strength, which are not here and there carried on by women. Women can shave, cut hair, cook, bind books, make watches, do all kinds of clerks' work, and dlscharge aU kinds of menial and household duties, if not as well as men, still sufficiently well. Yet you do not hold up bankers' and merchants' clerks, tilors, hairdressers, shoemakers, bookbinders, watch. makers, footmen, butlers, and all those kinds of indus. trials to opprobrium, as you have done us, because they do not instantly enlist. Why single us out? Why not ask the idle gentlemen in the clubs to enlist ? Why not assail the luxurious duchess who rolls along St. James's-street with two whiskered six-footers behind her carriage for detaining such lusty giants from thle war? Why not sneer at the pursy duke, her husband, for employing a man cook in his kitchen while India re(quires the ervices of biawny arms like his, conversant wlth batteries and inured to fire ? All your ridicule, Sir, will not induce a single man to enlist who has noz otherwise got good reasons for doing It. If the Government wants more men, a sufficient temptation must be held out to them to enterthe army. The uneducated will be attracted by higher bounty and higher pay-the educated by a fairer prospect of promotion than is now offered to them. Tell us, clerks and shoprmen, that if we prove ourselves -devoted, intellgent, steady, and brave, we shall receive iu return for those qualities the reward whioh the privileged classes now obtain for money-viz., promotion to the highest grades, if we deserve it, and sufficient pay to maintain us meanwhile, and then we will give you leave to laugh at us for want of spirit if we refrain from the rranks; bet do not now reproach us for not embarking ou:- lives in a venture in which the prizesare monopolized by moneyed men *vhile the hard work and the blanks are for such as we are. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. ALFRED LB MEASURER. lUdgate-hiUL

Yesterday a meeting of the olergy of all denominations and leading gentry and inhabitants of Marylebone held a preliminary meeting at the Marylebone Court-house, forthe purpose of making the necessary arrangement3 for forming a committee and making a demonstration in aid of the sufferers by the Indian mutiniee, The rector of Marylebone, the Rev. Dr. Eyre, presided, and was supported by the churchwardens. the Rev. Dr. Burns, the Rev. Mr. LaudelUs, the Rev. D. W. Marks, and a number of influential inhabitants were present. The Rev, CHIltR IRSN refened to the frightful mamssres which had taken place, not only among our brave countrymen in India, baS also to the atrocities committed upon innocent and helpless mothers and children. The sufferings which had 'een crested called for the aid and assistance of sympathizing bretbren in this country, and hewas quite su=e that the great and wealthy district of Marylebone would not be behird otber parts of the kingdom In cortributing to the aid of the general fund. (Hear.) With that obi'ect the vestry had placed the Cour'-house at their disposal, and Mr. Greenwell, the vestry-clerk, had kindly consented to act as the hon. secretary. The churchwardens would also on a sultable day ba prepared to convene a public n eeting of tle entire parish. (Hear, hear.) Mr. (;GnEE.NvELL read a list of the names of gentlemen who had Elrerdy consented to act on the Marylebono Coramittee, and a large number of additional names was handed in on this occasion. The Rev. Dr. BuRXs, the Rev. D. W. MA&r ;S, and other gentlemen enforced the necessity of all denominations joining in this movement of raising subscriptions for the sufTerers by the matiny; and it was resolved that the churchw ardens of Mar~lebone be requesed to convene the public n eeting o; the inhabitants oS the parish on Mlonday, the 12th of Octocer, and that in the meantime the committee already formed he requested to promote subscriptions in aid of the object. It wias further resolved,- That Sir Salnuel 1Scott's banking house In Cavendlah-aquare E requested to receive subecriDtions towards the Mar~lebone f snd, aed th.t tho veet.y-clerk alwo receieo subcriptions at the Couirthonse." Tha.-ks to the rev. chairman terminated the proceedings. BLOOMSBURY. A public meeting in furtherance of this fund was held last evening at the Music-hall, Store-street, Bedford-square, which was densely crowded. The proceedings c-cm enced with prayer by the Rev. Mr. Dibdin, in which special n-ention wias made of that gallant soldier who was a Christian as well as a warrior-General HIavelock. General AL.EXA.DER, who presided, gave an interesting description of the difference existing between the armies of the various pres-dsncies of India, and said the mutiny of the most favoured of those armies was most urgrateful. He could not ?gree that there had been no preseous warnings ven to Governuent of the probability of some such outDresk, but he admitted that it could not have entered the mind of any European who had served in India that the men who had for so long been enlisted under our standard would have all at once murdered their officers and committed atrocities which were too appalling to mention. When the first intelligence of the misfortune reached this country it was attributed by many persolis, and even by some in Parlian-ent, to those whom they descri'oed as coarsely as untrmly the - saints. The mis. smonaries had noo baen the cause o; the outbreak, the natives of India wero fully aware of that; and in a meetIng of native gentlemen held in June last those pious and hardworklng ministers wese spoken of in terms of the highest respect ard veneration. A snore probable cause for the outbreak was to bs found in the fears of the Hindoo and Mabomedan priests, who were fearful lest the extension of knowledge should deprive them of their wonted power over the peoplo, and therefore sought the earliest pretext for arousing the excited passions of a fanatic raoe. Mr. J. MAXWELL proposed a resolution expressive of sympathy with those who were suffering or had suffered in courequence o; the mutinies. He denied that the missionaries had been in any way accessory to the sad events which all deplored. On the contrary, he believed that had there been more missionaries thera would have been less probability of those misfortanes. (Hear.) Many taunts at first had been uttered against preaching colonels and Christian officers in India, but those scoffings had ceased now that it was known that General favelock, whose gallant services all admitted, was also a pious and God-servinag Christian. lIzear.) Mlr. BRIDGES seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously. The Rev. Dr. CAMirPBsLL, in proposing the next resolution, which pledoed the meeting to aid the efforts now being mnade to relieve tne sufferers, remarked that in gover.ing India we had given the natives arms, which were power of rce kind, and knowledge, which was power, of another, and bothwere now turned against us because we had, as a nation, withheld from them the knowledge of the Word of God. He believed that the simple fact of 1C0,000 Europeans governing in India 180,000,000 of people was an evident indication of the Almighty will that we shou!d raise up tbose prostrate nations from the degra?ation of heathenism by teaching them the service of the only living God. He believcd, howevor, that the present crisis woald revalt in a mmplete change of Dolicy, and that the Government and the nation would b^e awaked by this rude shock to theiduties in this respect. lhis resolution, having been seconded, was also carried unaDimously. The Rev. Dr. Cm, ira e-, on proposing a vote of thanks to the chairman, reminded the meeting that ibey bzd met for another purpose than to decide upon the cauass of the mutiny, and to whom blame was attributable. Those things would be inquired into hereafter; but at present it w?-s the duty of aU to aid in suppressing an abonm'uable outburst of fauat'c ard unholy p.-ssion. and to contributo to their very utmost in allevLt'ng the sufferings of those who were leZt destitute throigh ,he urhappy events which had ocourred in India. The Rev. Mr. Dzimi-, (wbo was the originatar of the meeting) seconded the vote of thanks to the chairman which was canied, and the proccedings terminated, a liberal collection being made at the doors. ROCHESTER. A crowded and influential meeting convened by the Mfayor of Rochester and the High Constables of Chatham sDd Giiingham took nlace lDst evening at the Guildball. The MIAY O. (llr. Minclark), in opening the business of the ineeotig, said there WaS but one feeling of detestation throughout the whole oi England in respect of the hornible atrocities which had been inflicted on their countrymen and countrywomen in India, and it was their duty to rhow the eympathy they felt f or the viroogs which had he3on inilloted by doing all whlch lay in their power to mitigate the sufferings of their fellow-countrymen in that distant country. (Cheers.) The Rev. Dr. ROBIXSON, Mlaster of tho Temple, a-id Arehdeacon of Madras, moved the following resolution:- Tbhat tbi meetir--, detesting the atrocit5se peieotrated by the rebels In I'dia, and deeply sympathizing with the sufferingsofour feslow* canntryssen there. beartIly oonoars in the rngements nowrL pror,rem throuchout Fnusuvd for their raelef." There was but one feeling which animated the breasts of all riases thrss."houv the length and breadth of England, which was, the deepest sympathy for those who had suffered in India. When they read in Tfie Times and other daily papers the hor ible narratives of what hr i occurrz*d in Indla they felt thaa a great wrong h_d been done I o the nameand majesty o. England. (Hear,hear.) Ourdisbant empire had beea shaken to its foundation, as if an earth a'.e had met us in the midst of our repose, and beyond the earlbtquake there had appeared the volcano. Themight and majesty of England had been defied, and now the liobeart of Englishmen had been roued lie alion from its lair, and the stern cry was raised, "Justice for outraged humriity, and sympathy for the srfferers." (Cheeis.) Mr. J. M. MARxS, high constable of the b rongh of Cbatham, seconded the resolution, which was agreed to unruimously. Major-Geneora Sir FaEDERICK Sm].TH, M.P. for Cbatham, mo.,ed- "Tnat subcrlpiuons be foalhvwith entered Into for the Dr-poe c OvIsn a7d aud assitance to the sutererrs by tbe rebeluon in India." He had no iear whatever as to what the result of the prcsent conflict in India woald be, even if the whole of the Sepoy force were raised against us. It was no.v useless to waste time by vain regrets, but]et them gird themselves to the struggle and mcet the dilliculty with a bold a-d determined spirlt. (Cheers.) An examnle had been set them by the head of the Mossulman Church, who by his reaent act h2d altogether taken r way the appearance of its being a relic ous rising of Mumssnnalns and Hindoos. They must induce the rising generation far and near to enter the aumy, and to encourage tliem to do so the heiebt must be reduced. In order to guard against a futire srp,rlse only a small supply of ammunition woald be allowed the native troops, and the artillery and cavalry would be entirely Europeans. (Hear, hear.) The Rev. Dr. HAwoenes, Provost of Oriel College, in seconding the resolation. said tbey must nc' only subscribe liberally, biut also hold themselves ready to give age1n antd again if It were needed. He hoped that when punishmenmt overtook the gc;Py they would not retaliate cruelty by cruelthy, but that brave soldiers would atbo show that they were humane.~~~~~r A committee was ap'iointed for raising the necessary csascriptions, and it is expected that the sum sent from tbis city and Chatham will be very large. Subscriptions amountIng to several handred pounds were announcedat 'Ce close of the meeting CHATE&A. A subscription has been set on foot among the offioers an(I men belongiDg to the various branches of the service at Chatham for the relief of the suffers by the Indian mutineers. It is probs d.Ae that a large sum will be realized, ss the officers and troops of the various corps have expressed their wish to subscribe a day's pay, and in many instances much more, towards the fund. LEICESTERSHEEBE. A ceorrespondent says :-" On Wednesday, having been chosen one 01 a committee for obtaining contributions to the Indlan Mutiny Fund from a market town in Leicester. shire, I had a district allotied to myself and a friend, which was the poorest in the town ; with hardly ra exception our application was heard with respet and success in our endeavorvs was heartily wished us. At many houses we did rot call, for those who live in them themselves are greatly in need of assistance. But we were surprised at the evident desire rnanifested to give of their little by even the poorest, and the hearty sympathy expressed for wbat our countrymen have endurcd and with what they have achieved, the terrible reality of their sufferings being better understood than we had any idea it would he, or could have expected. Among several touohing instances of this real sympathy I will name one. We called at one house, and when the door was opened we related our tale; the poor woman said she had nothing to give, and we came r way. On passiug down the opposite side of the street else elled us across, and said she had a son a soldier, and, for his sekl, requested us to take 2d, as her contribution. Fearing lest we muight offend her by declining it, we added it to our list; but it was her alL W'e thought as we cauce away, if the rich gave ien so mu4h it. w,'uld be but little to the effort and sacrifice made by the poor., EXMOUTH. A public meeting was held last Wednesday In this town to consider the best means of contributing to our distrewsed countrymen in India. Admiral Sir Fairfax Moresby plresided. Mr. W. COLE COLF (county magistrate) proposed, and Mr. C. PRETTEJOHN seconded, the following resolution:- " That this meeting desires to express It deep sympathy with those who, from the rebello in India, have saffered great hardships, privations, and losse: and also Its condolence with the relations and frienda of those whose lives have been treacherousy sacrificed in this unhappy outbreak." At the close of the meeting upwards of 1501. was announced. BRIDGEWATER. On Thursday a meetiDg of the inhabitants of Bridgewater and neighbourhood was held in the Town-hal, for the purpose of sympathizing wfith and aiding our suffering country. men and countrywomen in the East. The Mayor, Mr. J Ruddook, presided, and there was a good attendance. The Rev. M. F. SAISLER, M.A., vicar of Bridgewater, moved the first resolution: "That this meetg, while cowring Ita Indignation at the nuparal. leled cruelties which have mrwked the mnutiles in Indila, deires to expres its deep sympathy with the nurmerous unhappy sufferers, aud ita sorow at the state of destitution to which so many ase thereby rednied. and is anxious to te3tify ib cordial concurmnce with the endeaeooss which are beiDg made to allevlate their privation., and that a subscription be entered Into In aid of the futd now being raised by the Lord Mayor of Loondon and sanctioned by Hler Majesty the Queen." No words, said the rev. gentleman, could express the feel. iags excited in the breast of every Euglishman on reading of the atrocities committed upon our fellow-creatures, our feUo.-countrymen, our fellow-Christians in the Es. The resolution said that they were unparalleled, and he believed they were unequalled in the history of the world. (HFer, hear.) He had reed almost all andent and modern history, but he recollected nothing comparable to the horrible barbarities perpetrated on our own flesh and blood during the last three months. (Hear, hear.) Mr. J. SE.LY seconded the resolution, and maintained that Govesaruent had not properly supported Christianity in India. Mr. BOARD, in opposition to the two former speakers, contended that missionary proselytism had creaed the rebellion. Dr. KINCG proposed as an amendment- "That, In the opinion of this ceating, Lord Palmereton deseve oensure for disusisng Parliament without obtaining its snction and consent to adopt such measures as would reUeve promDtly the widows and orphan, the wounded and helpless persons, who have euffereL and are likely to suffer, from the mutiny of the Sepols." The amendment did not meet with a seconder, and the original resolution was carried unanimously. After motions had been pased appointing a committee, secretary, and treasurer, and solciting the clergy andjDls. sent-in ministers of the town and neighbourhood to cause collections to be made in their several placeS of worship, Mr. S. BAILEY proposed,- " That, in th opinloD of thhI meeting, It Is incumbent on ths British Government and the East India Company to take immediate steps r esating evey department ot the executive Government of British Indi3 in the hands of the Queen and the Government for the being." lr. W. TAYLOR seconded the resolution, and It passed unanimously. A memorial to Her Majesty was adopted, representing the determination of her Bridgewater subjects to afford her every support in their power to quell the rebeldon with a strong arm. Upwards of 100&was subscribed in the room, and a houseto-house canvass will be made. HEMEL HEMPSTEAD. A mneeting of the inhabitants of this town, under the presidency of MIr. Henry Day, the high bailiff, was hold on Thursday. L-etters were read from the Hon. GranviUe Dudley Ryder enclosing a subscription'(in addition to a former subscription in London) 51.; Mr. and Mrs. Moore Halsey, of Gadsden. park, 51.; Mrs. Hoare, of Gadsden Bury, 101; Mr. .R. Eden, of Bovingdon, 51. ; and Mr. T. Butcher, banker, of Tring, promising support. The meeting was addressed at some length by the Revs. J. H. Mforgan and J. B. Bingham, Mr. IL Day, Sir A. P. Coo,er, Bart., and others, and resolutions adopted declaratory of the object of the meeting and a subscription list opened, 701., including 201. fromSir Astley Paston Cooper, being subscribed in the room. STROUJD. A meeting convened by the High Constable of the borough, in compliance with a numerously-signed requisi tlon, was held in the Subscription Rooms, Stroud, on Thursday afternoon, for the purpose of sympathizing with the sufferers in India. Mr. S. S. Dickenson, a gentleman who formerly residei in India, was caUed to the chair. MIr. N. F. MARLING, of Stonehouse-court, moved the first resolution, expressive of sympathy with the Indian sufferers. Mr. J. W. RALLEWV-ELL, magistrate, in seconding It. said he hoped there was no maudlin feelng of sentiment towards those horrid brutes in India, and he boped that for those diabolical and cold-blooded massacres we might he the instruments in God's hands of a punishmnent the most tremendous and the most appalling. A sum of 247i. was subscribed at the meeting, but the bulk of the inhabitants have not yet had an opportunilty of subscribing. CHIPPENHAM. A meeting was held in Chippenbam yesterday, the Mayor in the chair. The first resolution was moved by Mr. P. P. NisBors, M.P, : "Ta that meeting views with feelings of the deepest sorrow and Indignation the unparalieled atrocities which have been recently perpetrated in India upon our fellow-subjects, espedsclly npon the woraen and children, and hereby exprese Its warmest symDpathy with thosa who are stil exposed to danger and yrlvatlons abroad, and ailso with these who are mourning over their bereavements at homne." Mr. Nisbet, who was for many years a resident in India, said that, so far from the mutiny in that country being occasiored by oppression on our parts, It had, in his opinion, been the result of over indulgence. Sir J. W. ANVDRY, in seconding the resolution, said ha was one of those who was introduced among the governing class in India many years ago, when a jealousy existed with regard to the government of that country, for the express purpose of bemg a check on the malversations of the Government, and he could speak of the wonder which hb felt at the accomplishments of that noble service, the last India Company, and of the impartial way in which justice was administered. He spoke confidently when he said that the people were much less oppressed by their present rulers than they would have been under any native Govermenrt wbich had ever existed, or which was ever likely to exist. The Rev. I. V. LAW moved the second resolution:- 1 That,in ordre to meet the urgent necesetiles of thoee who ha e boen left desttute i'y the Indiau mutiny, a fand be raised for their reUef. and that the inhabltants of this town and neighbourhcod be invited to actwith theta accustomed liberlityat tuis preselng andunprece. dented crilsi, and *hat subscriptions be paid to elther of the banks ls ahiUDppbamn." mr. Law alluded to the fact that Chipponham was one of the first boroughs which cause forwrtd to Od the Patriic und; and if they were a litte behind-hand now, It wee in consequence of the delay which hadbc 3n occasioned oy thleir wish to raise 100 men, as a volunteer corps, to preceed to India to aid the Government in the present crlsis. The resolution was secoided by tbql Rev, Mr. STRONG. ne Rev. Mr. AsnE then addressed the meeting, and in doing so said there were times when outraged human nature demanded the strictest, the sternest justicec; and the Angel of Mercy should not be permitted to return to the gory plains of India until the dark wings of the Angel of Death had avenged the atro^ities which had been perpetrated in that country. He trusted that England woula never rest till a monument to our lost countrymen had bren raised from the stones of those temples where de-v3l-worship had produced such monsters, and until the stones w hich formed that monument had been cemented by the blood of the foulest murderers the world had yet seen. ABERGAVENNY. A meeting called by the vicar was held in the Town-hall on Thursday. The attendance was not very numerous, but ironuded several of the leading men of the town. The vicar (the Rev. W. Powell) presided. Mr. W. STEEL proposed the first resolution I That this Teacting feels that the barbarous masscs and the Inhumnan cruelties which have been perpetrated on our fellow-3ubjects and feUow-Ohyistans in India during the present muttuy thero cal fora publc expresion of intense horror at such unpaoalleled atroctles. and of deep-felt sorrowland s'mpathy for the cruel fate of those who have been the Tictims of them." Mr. J. PRICE, in seconding the resolution said the atrocities which bad been committed by the Indian mutineers were so direful in their results, so diabolical in their nature, as almost to induce the belief thatHell itself had burst open its bonds, and sent forth its fiends to revel in evil ana for a season to pallute and convert God's fair earth into a Pandemonim_ While desirous to see stern, Inflexible justice assert its claims, he would say, let no wanton ernelty, nto indiscriminate vengeance sully our arms; let us remember in the hour of triumph-if G od in His mercy should ever permit that hour to arrive-that vengeance belonged not to us. " Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, and I will repay." (Hear.) The Rev. T. WILLIAMS, in moving the next resolution, expressed himself pleased that the nevwspapers had given up repeating the calumnies against the missionaries in India, which had at first been adopted as the probable cause of the insurrection. He was inclined rather to find that cause in our disobedience to the Scriptural command to preach the Gospel throughout the world; and while he did not advocate a recourse to force to spread the pure primcipl.sothe Chriztian religion, he boped that we ehonld in future be more mindful of our positive duty as a nation. Mtr. E. Y. STxeL seconded the resolution, which was agreed to. A committee for collecting subscriptions ws appointed, and a subscription list was opened in the room, The vicar, in acknowledging the vote of thanks for his conduct isn the chaIr, remarked w ith great energy that he had not heard any direct allusion to that infernal fiend, Nena Sahib, a limb of the deviL who he trusted would soon be brought to his dire account in this world; how it would fare with him in the next God only knew. The monster seemed to have orgotten, or never to have learnt, the old Egligsh proverb, that "-those who are born to be hsuged will never be drowned ;" and it seemed he bad escaped~ drowning that he might verify the truth of the proverb, and die the death to wfhch he was destined.

TheProvostandmagistrates of Leith have issued a warm recommendation to theinhabitants of that town to intrust them with subscriptions for the Relief Fund, and public meetings have been held in Dalkeith and other neigbonring towns to advance the object. A commaittee of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland have issued a recommendation to make a liberal collection for the sufferers on the day appointed for the National Fast, the Presbytery of Edinburgh havingalso separately taken the same course with the view especialy of enabling the humbler classes, whom the subscription pa may not reach, to contribute towards the fnnd. 1,e Ediburgh subscriptlon is to be placed at thedisposal of the Lord Mayor of London for distribution eitber at home or in India, as circumstances and the Limitation to foreign distribution of the London subscription may seem to require.

THE TRUE NATURE OP THE AUSTRIAN AMNESZT. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir, -Your Vienna correspondent, in IkC Times of yes. terday, in reference to the Austrian amnesties, says,- " The smnesties granted by His Majesty when in Italy and liuncary were not so complete an was at fisat believed. Iany reongees bays spplied in vain for perrnisson to retarn to their homes, and in several caes no reply was given to the petitions presented." I beg to cor-.oborate the correct notion of your correspondent on that subject, stating that I myself had the honour of petitioning His Imperial Majesty for an amnesty, but to the petition, dated the 4th of June, no reply was given. Meanwhile, if permission is granted to somebody to return to his home he is commanded to go to Vienna to present himself before the military court. for in. vestigation, where he has to await his fate, perhaps of pardon or imprissonment, according to his conduct in reference to the affairs of Hrungary in 188-9. This is the true nature of that highly spoken of Austrian clemency-in reality, dust thrown in the eyes of Europs. I have the honour to be vonr oheAan-t -Ar-n J.

PAUIPERISM AND CHARITABrg L NsTmmoys.- Under this title M. Louis Reybaud, of the Institute has published an interesting paper in the last number o? the .cRvuc des Deux Mond,s. The author, after pasaing in review all the means employed of late to alleviate the sAiseries of the poor, such as artificialy lowering the price of bread, opening kitchens for the poor, giving an excessive Impulse to public works, &c., establishes the remarkable fact, that the more public assistance assumes an organized shape the greater is the increase in the number of those who claim its protection. This, he shows, has been the constant effect of official charity, from the days of the republic of Athens to those of the Lower Empire, from the reigns of Henry I. of France and of Elizabeth of England to the present day. After explaining the part which the clergy took, from the earliest dawn of Christianity, in the 0og7aation and distribution of private cbarities, aad giving a succinct view of the progress of the Poor Laws in England, their subsequent revision in 1834, and the effects which it has produced, he refers to the Imperial decree of the 5th of July, 1808, enacting that every deparhnent should have its depot de mendicit, a measure which, notwithstanding the immense authority of the Emperor, was only obeyed in :37 departments. At the Restoration the matter was allowed to go on in the old way, but between 1840 and 1848 a .ertain numbez of dep6ts were reopened, and the jurisprudence relating to mendicity improved. Still to this day only 16 depirtments of France have dep6,ts, and, while these inatitut ons have had the effect of banishing mendicity from the t,rritories to which they belong, they have on the other hand caused an immense immigration of mend'icamns into the neighbouring departments, thus making the evil break out under an aggravated form in other quarters. If it be asked why in that case the decree of 1808 has not been enforced in all departments, it will be answered that many of them, already overloaded with debts, have not the requisite means. Compulsory charity, therefore, the author argues, Is not applicable to France. Here he describes a successful experinment made in the Xievre by the prefect, Mi. de Magnitot. Convinced of the difficulty and danger of having recourse to a forced contributlion for the establishment of a depot, he conceved the idea of regulating the exercise of public charity in the following manner. In 1854, a subsczlption was opened a mong al the wealthy inhabitants of the department and those of moderate means, for a fixed annual sum to be paid by each for a period of five years. The amount was left to the goodwiU of the subscriber, and any one who chose might refuse to contribute. The experiIn;nt succeeded, and in a few months subscriptions were collected to the annual amount of 242,322f., payable per quarter. A decree of January 24, 18;5, authos;zed the e-tablishment of the dep6t, and this institution is actually in existence until the expiration of the five years, when the experiment will have to be renewed. Theeffect of the measure was in some cases extremely curious. As it was easy to foresee a great many mendicants left the depaitment; a few others left off their vagrant habits and set about earning their livelihood by honest manual labour. But some actually declared their intention of living henceforth on their incomes, and one fellow especially, covered with miserable rags, turned out to be the owner of two houses in the department. Some, who had the means, but could not bear the ides of living on their incomes, attempted to get themselves inscribed on the list of those entitled to out-door reh ef. The neighbouring departments, on the other hand, Ithe Alier, the Loiret, and the Cote d'Or were inundated Ewvtith vagrants from the Nldvre, and were loud in their out!cry against the latter,. xKeybaud states the sum total of the means at the disposal of the Bureaux de Bienfaisance an,d other'charitable ;ustitutions of France at 17,*381,257f. per annum, or, on an average, 12f. c, for each person relieved. But this sum is by no means eqaoly distributed. Thus the bureaux of Paris have a revenue of 2,294,364f., while that of St. Ythaire (Saone-et-Loire) can boast of no more than 51c. At Martignac, in the Ain, the average of assistance is only le. per head, while at Montb6llardot, in the Doubs, it reaches the exorbitant sum of 899f. We surmise, though the author of the article is not sufficiently explicit on the subject, that in the extreme cases ef St. Ythaire and artignao the Bureau de Bienfatsance, though legally authorized, ceased to exist de facto for want of funds; and that at Hontb6liardot there were so few Daupers that, after affording each a reasonable amount of relief, there remained an ample surplus in the hands of the bureau. Out of the 36,820 oommunes of France, only 9,336 have Bareaux de Bienfaisance, affording relief to 1,329,655 persons. But of these 9,336 communes there sre 1,062 where, as in the case of St. YthLare, the bureaux have no funds at all, and upwards of 1,000 more the resources of which do not exceed 100f. There are, therefore, upwards of 27,000 communes in France where private charity alone exists, unaided by bureaux. Here the author asks, are these communes on that account in a worse condition than the others? Is there more property among them? This, besays, hasneverbeeninquired into; but it may be assumed that if they found it advantageous to have bureaux they would certainly have established some. hI. Reybaud remarks that among the evils of bureaux are these-that the money they distribute generally goes to the wine-shop Instead of to the family, and that out of the 17 millions of francs above mentioned upwards of three millions are necessarily absorbed by the cost of administration. Again, if one of the chief ob. jections to private charity is that it is often thrown away upon unworthy objects, the same inconvenience undoubtedly attends official charity. Hence, hl. Reybaud concludes against the latter, as acknowledging the legal right of paupers to relief, and therefore tending to increase the number of that class-in other words, to encourage idleness atuong the population. Two kinds only of public charity he admits as wise and beneficial-viz., out-door assistance and relief in kind. The former affords the means of jug. ing of the veal necessiStiec of the applicant, and the bs ster directly meats the more immediate wzants of tbe. pauper vwithori tempting himto frequent the puhlichous.e.

TH.B LATE MUR?DER IN LEIGH WOODS, NEAR BRISTOL. BOtYTON, FRIDAY MORICggo. The adjourned examination of witnesses in support of the charge of murder agaiLst John William Beale was resumed this morning in the Board-room of the Bourton union. The prisoner was bzought up from Taunton gaol, and reached the Ashton station of the Bristol and Exeter Railwayaboat 10 o'clock, aud was conveyed thence to Bourton. Mr. . X. Harris, solicitor, of Bath, aspPeared to watoh the case on behalf of the accused. The presiding magistrates were the Rev. Henry Mirehouse (chairman), Sir John Hare, Colonel Burrowes, Messrs. Shorland, Mordaunt, Rockett, W. H. Gore Langton, MLP., J. H. Mlirehouse, W. Miles, ML.P., &a. The prisoner's father and sister, vho had come over from Bath, were allowed to have an interview with him before w was brought into court. The Chairman informed a.M'Harris that the magistrates were satisfied upon consideration that the shirt produced by the witness Payne was not stained with the blood of the deceased woman, and that therefore they should merely return the deposition wkich aad. been taken, aud give the prisener's counsel an opportunity of calling the witness if he should think fit. The evidence taken on the last occasion having been read over, Mr. Harris declined to cross-examine any of the witnessee. In reply to Mr. Miles, George West, the under-keeper, stated that the place where he first discovered the blood we, ahout two yards from the place whera the body was found; this was a concealed spot under the rock, which be might have passed several times without noticing the body had no' his attention been attracted by the blood. The body had evidently been placed where It was found, becaie tbe clothes were aU smoothed down in order. The object ap. peared to have been to conceal the body. Mr. Superintendent Joneses evidence having been read over, containing a list of the articles of clothing found on deceased, &c., the witness stated in reply to the chairman that he had discovered a hat in Rownham wood, near the buttress of the Clifton suspension bridge, on Sunday, the 20th ult. The hat was not there on the previous day. Mr. Lucas, surgeon, added to bis former evidence, that on the 19th of September it was impossible to have identified the body, decomposition having set in. The only means wbich might lead to Identification of the deceased were the t-eth he had extracted, and which wero very p culiar both as regarded the decay and the stopping with which the decayed places had been fllled. Tbe peculHarity about the teeth was such that it 'would have been noticed during the lifetime of the deceased. From the body having been quite fresh when he first saw it on Saturday, the v2th ult., and f.om the heat of the weather, it could not have besn dead more than twro or three d2ys. A deposition by Mr. Chadwick, magistrates' clerk, embcdying the previous statement, was next pit in, but as it contained additional matter, on tl e recommendation of Ur. Miles, M-P., the deposition was rejected and the original statement was adopted. The depositions of Inspector Norris and of the Daventry witnesses, Sausome, Payne, aud Branscombe, having been read, Cbarles Wallington deposed,-I am a railway porter at the Freshford station of the Wilts and Somerset Railway. I recolect seeing the prisoner at the ofFce at Freshford on the 9th ult. ile asked me the way to Mr. Bytbesea's. I pointedl out the direcion of the hoj-L-e to him. I sawr Mr. Bythesea's butler the san edey,wbhorequestedme to send for the cook's boxes. I went there and fetched three boxes, they were each directed to " Mr. Beale." I edded to the directions, " Till called for." I afterwards ertered the boxes and forwarded them to Bristol by the 8 45 p.m. train from Freshford. Louisa Elizabeth Ford, examined by Mr. Mfiles-I am housekee1 er to Mr. S. W. Bythesea, of Hill-house, Freshford, near Bath. I have known Charlotte Pugsley for more than two years. She was cook in Mfr. Bytheseas service from the 27th of June to the 9th of September, when she left. The prisoner came to our house about 4 o'clock that afternoon. Charlotte Pugsley brought himto my zoom and introduced him. After shaking hands with me I asked him to take a seat. I asked him where be had comefrom, and hesaidfromBath. Iasked him abouthis father and mother, and he said he had not seen them. I asked is he was not going to see them before he left England; and he told me that he was not, for they were not friendly. I have known the prisoner rnore than two years. I was in cervice wivh Charlotte Pugsley before at Mirs. Admiral Western's, 8, River-street, Bath. We were quite as sisters. We slept together a. Mrs. Western's, and we left together in DecemberLast. Theprisoner had visited Charlotte Pugsley reoeatedly at Mrs. Western's. The prisoner has told mrathat he was going to be married to Charlotte Pageley. He was living at the time with Mr. Mogg, near Park's cottage, about two m:les and a-half from Bath. When he came to Freshford he told me he was going to be mearriei to Charlotte Pugrley at St. Mary's Church, Southampton, on the Saturday after they left, and that Charlotte was golug to lodge with the clerk of the church till they were married, after which they were going to America. All this was said in the presence of Charlotte Pugsley. I asked him where Charlotte was going to sleep at Bristol, as ke said they were going there that night, aud he told me he had taken lodgings for her near the railway station, and he was going to sleep with his cousin, but he did not say whore his cousin lived. I told him I thought it would be nearer and less expensive to go to Southau pton by the London line; he said he had business to transact in Bristoland he was bourd to go that way. He said they should leave Bristol about 5 o'c!ock on Tlhursday afternoon, the 10th. EIe asked noe if I knew the chuxrch at Southampton. I told him that I did, as I had been there. I toldhim I did not approve his not going to see his father and mother, as no blessing attended children who were not kind to their parents. He told me that they cared nothing about him, and he should not care for them. I asked him how he had left his situation at Daventry, and he said his master and mistress had gone with their family to India about a fortnight before, and hid discharged all the servants except the naid. After some tine the prisoner left the housevwith Charlotte Pagsley about half-past 6 the same evening. She had on a gray alpaca dress, a speckled straw bonnet wibh drab riband edged with green. I believe it was pink inside the bonnet. Ste had a black fall with ieee edge, a black cloak trimnred with bla^k bidid. She carried a green barege shawl cu her arm. I paid her on the 1st of September 31. 15s. wages up to the 27thof September. On the following Moudsy I paid her 9s. board wages. She had taken tome money out of the Bath Savings'-bank on the Satarday previous to her going away. I was presont when the boxes were fetehed. The prisoner had piaviovsly co!ded them in the kitchen. J was present wken Pugsley packed the large box, and saw her put nearly Pll the thiugs in. I have since seen the box at the Bristol Central Police-station. It contained nearly all the thin,s I had seen put im. Some of the things in the large box were her wedding thingE. (Inspector Norris here produced the large box, whish was identified by the witness.) I saw this box packed. I s£ V the prisoner cord it, and sawv it t.,ken away. Inspector Norris stated that the boxes contained wearing apparel, books, and other things; he found the Lu gs one in te bedroom of the prisoner at Badhy-house, and the two others in the cellar. Louisa Elizabeth Ford examined.-There are only two things in the three boxes which I do no' know to belong to Charlotte Pugsley. (Superin)tendentJoues here produced the clothes which were taken off the decea--ed. Tnoy were also identified by the witness Ford as having belouged to Charlotte Pagsley.) The deceved told me tFe way her teeth were stopped. I have seen the teeth ex'racted by Ir. Lucas, and am satisfied they are the teeth of Charlotte By Mr. Harrls.-I have not seon the teeth In the body since her decease. Re-examined.-When the prisoner'wAs leaving the house I asked her to vrite to me from Soutbampton; she said she would, but the prisoner said she world not have time before she left Soathampton, but she should write wben they got to Amer.ca, The Prisoner and deceased both drank tea together in my room befora they left. Mary Jane Kilson.-I am a dres^smaker. residing aLt Freshford. The gray alpaca dress now produced tome was remade by me for harlotte Pugsley on the lst of September. I nmade Eome print dresses for her at the same time, which I sent home oa the morning of the 9th of September. I have since secn thcse other dre ^ss in the possession of Inspector Norris. Charlotte Beazor.-I am housemaid at Mr. S. W. Bythesea's. I have scen the clothes In possession of Superintendent Jones. I knoer the stockings to be Charlotte Pugsley's. I darned them for her myself a few evenings before she left. I also know the gray alpaca dress by some black undersleeves which were put into It the evening she left. I know the boots by having worn them myself. I also know a pieco of netting produced from one of the boxes; it is my own work, and I gave it to Charlotte Pugsley. John Nash.-I am in the service of the Great Western Railway Company. I recollect Wednesday, tho 9th of September. The prisoner met the 9.40 p.m. train from Weymouth, a woman was In company 'with him. I assisted In getting out the luggage from that train ; there were three boxes in it addressed to Mr. Beale. The woman dui not say anything; the prisoner came forward vwhen the boxes were taken out of the train and claimed them, saying it was their luggage. He said the train they came by did not stop at Freshford, annd they had walked on to Limpley Stoke, aad tho lupgage was sent on from Fr ford. I made a charge of 3s. 10d. for the luggage, and he refused to pay it. I told him he had better leave the boxes in the parcels-office for the night, and perhaps Mr. Viner, the clerk, would free him in the morning. Re took my advice and left with the woman. By Mr. Harrls.-I did not see the prisoner speak to any woman. I saw the prisoner and the woman, who appeared to be In company with him, go away together. I did not observe how she was dressed. Be-examined.-I had no dispute about lugage In that train with any person but the prisoner, I have no doubt he is the person. Henry Viner.-I am parcels clerk at the Bristol station of the Great Western Railway. On Thursday morning, the 10th of September, the prlsoner caune to my office for three boxes in the name of "Beale," whicb were lying there. I have aeon and ideratifsed these boxes at the Central Police- station, BristoL We had a good deal of conversation about the 3s. lOd, charged for tie luggage,aud I recommended him. to go and see the station mperiatendent about it. He went away, and on his return he paid the money. le then asked ma to allow the boxes to xemain in my office, as he was gong to Liverpool. I recommended him to have the boxes tken to the Midland office and put inthe cloak-room, and he went and got a porter, and they were renmoved from mry office. Tbhomas Si"ertborne.-I am porter in the Midland cloak room to the Great Western Compa.,y. I remember seeing the prisoner on Thursday mormn,lg, September 10, about ll o'clock. I received three hb xes from him addressed " Mr. Beale, to be left till csaed for; " he asked to leave them in the cloak room, and 'T did so, and gave him a ticket, for which he paid 6id. I -produce the receipt ticket. I have seen the boxes and ',.ave identified them. TOe pzisoner told moe lie wa goiug to Liverpool when III arought tho boxes. There wa wna asr dln^@outside tht door at tho time ; wrhen the prisoner rest oUlt she joined him, and they went down the street toge.'ht'r. the tioket Ihad gi¶-en tbeprjoner wras returned In the rr7rse of the 12eh By Mr. klarris.-I Am certhin the prisoner ald WoUn n wentaway together; they went down the stre?t arm in arns Robert Miller, butler to Mr. S.

Beale asked witness to go bhck to Freshford static, and have the boxes fetched dvrn from the house, and redirested "to be left till called fcr>' at BristoL Louis& Dsvey.-I am the wife of Corey Davey, of No. 2; Ayre's-baildings, Nevr-cut. I knew the prisoner wheu I lived with Mr. Way, of Clfton-down, about 10 e.- 11 years ago, I saw him about half-past 11 in the mornting of Thursday, the 10th of September. I Was standing at the gate of my houso which looks out on the Cat. The prisoner was coming towards Rownhatu. Re had a young woman with him. I did not speak to the prisoner because I was so dirty. My mother was with me at the gate. She was going home, and I wished her " Good bye" because John Beale was coming. I am quite confident it was the prisoner I saw. I saw them again in a few minutes afterwards. They were then goiDg towards the prison, which is the straightest way to Rownham-ferry. It leads in other ways to BristoL The woman ws& dressed in an alpaca dress. I did not observe her bounet. I thought wvat a tidy person it was he had with htm, and I looked after them, because I had known Beale for so manylaars. WillVam Jones.-I am a tailor In the employ of Mr. Aplin, of Wine-street, Bristol. On Mlonday, the 7th of September, I saw the prisonerin tbe evening in Wine-street, and went with him to the ;ing's Head Tavern. Re remained about an hour and a-half, and left, saying he was going to the Casino. The next morning he came to Mr. Aplin's shop after a pair of trousers his cousin was making for him. While he vras there he pulled a very small pistol on tof his pocket. I saw tha. the pistol had a cap on it; the prisoner told me it was loaded. I gave the pistol to his cousin to measure the length of it, as he was going to have a pocket made in his coat to hold a pair of pistoLs. The pxisoner afterwards pat the pistol into his waistcoat pocket. The pistol produced by InspectorNorris is very simlar to the one Isaw. The prisoner said he was going to Bath when he left, and that he might comne over on the Wednesday and go to Asbton. Mr. Lncas, surgeon, recalled, stated that a pistol of the desecnption produced by Inspector Norris would infict the woumd and discharge the bullet found in the head of the deceLed. A bullet received from InspectorNorris weighed with the bullet taken from deoeased's head was about 2.1 grains heavier. Some of the other bullets in prisoner's powder flask weighed the same, or only differed about a grain. Part of the bullet taken from deceased's head wrar cutoff in extraction. John MIl, son of John Hill, tailor.-I am 13 years of age. On Thursday, the 10th of Septomber, I was at the top of Nightingale-valley, inside the wall, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Four other boys were vrith me. I saw a man and woman at tl-e top of the vaUey. They were conming fro'a the wall towards the river. I am sure I should hrow that man if I saw him again. I took notice of him ; he was walldng after the young woman ; I was up in a tree at this time with another boy, looking down upon them as they passed under. The prisoner is the man. I .-aw him here on Saturday last. I had given a description of him before to Mr. G(culd, the chief constable, and I afterwards saaw the prisoner and identified him. I Imow tle woman had on a dark dress, but I did not notice her hcnnet. About a quaaier of an hour after I had seen the pmioner and roman together I heard the report of a pistol or gun. It came from the direction in which they went. By Mr. Harris.-The prisoner had on a dark brown coat ada cap. The woman was a short woman. The man and wornan could have seen me where I was. William James Collins, son of J. P. Collins, of Wilson. street, another lad who vws in company with the last witness, confirmed his evidence. onpe, tor Norris, in addition to his former statement, handed in a complete inventory of the tbings found in the prisoner's bedroom and pantry, and in the boxes of the decereed, several of which were identified by M-iss Ford, tte 1 ousekeeper, as the property of Charlotte Pugsley. Norris also stated that on taking the prisoner into custody and chargXing him with the murder,head hi ow nothing at all abooutit. u , he said, i.I The prisoner, acting under the advlce of his solicitor, d-cined aying anythingain his defence, and was fully com. nitted for trial at tho next assize.
TO TEJ EDITOR OF THE TIM E,S Sir,-Will you allow me t-o suggest through your columns that while we are bending all our energies to subdue and punish the treacherous revolt which has wrought such waste and woe in India it is not less incumbent upon us at the tame time carefully to be gathering up for future reward every example of native fidelty and humanrity s I do not now allude to the case of the more eminent chiefs who have remained faithful to us, such as Holkar and Scindia, (if the latUer come oat clear from the suspicions which now hang over him); the nature of their reward wil probably be determined by considerations of policy; but to the humbler pettons,-petty chiefs, Sepoys, or head men of some obscure village-who have offered help to our countrymen in their extremity. Amid the hideous scenes of treachery and barbarlty which tLis fateful summer bas unrolled before us there have been occasional and cheering gliustses of the better instincts of our common humanity; and no one can have read the thrillirg narratives of danger and escape which day after dry have appeared in your columnss, without recaUing several exarnapes of kindness and fidelity, such as that of the Nazim M-cer Mahomed Hossein Rhan, who, at evident rislc to himself, sbeltered Colonel Lennox and his family; or of the Sepoy Tc2 AU Khan, " Among the faithlesa, faithful only he, who shared with his officers their flight from Fyzabad, and wa-, alas! almost the onlv survivor of its perils. But it is greatly to be feared that amid more pressing Cares such deeds as these may mniss their due rememubrance and roward, unless so-ne pains are taken to preserve a record of them. It might be well if every European who owes hiq ltfe, or lives dearer than his own, to the humanity of a native, were to send in the name and dwelling-place of the Good Samaritan to the Indian Govetninent; the list so gradually formed would then enable the authorities to be as exact in rewarding as in punishing. it is true that private gratitude will do much. We may be sure that the friends who have received back some beloved one as from the grave will never rest till some token of their thankfulness has been coni-eyed to those who helqad in his deliverance. But more thau private gratitude is concerned in this matter. England must convmce her Indian subjects that she is not more prompt to punish than to reward; and that if none who have wronged her children can be too high to feel the rigour of her justice, much more shaU none who have befriended them hA ton lnw tn } lac hed by her large gratitudo. F.
TO THJ EDITOR O THE TIMlfES. Sir,-I have but just seen Lord Powls's letter on the pro po,ed changes in the Welsh circuits, transferred to your columns on the 16th ult. from a Shrewsbury paper. Hig Lordship's object is to arouse the anourpropre, or, as he u511 tei.n it, the patriotism, of the Welsh gentry to a resistanCe equalUy successful with that vhich, it seems, they opWosed to a similar contemplated reform in 182S. he asks indignantly, "are Montgomery, Merioneth, Flint, Anglesea, ard liadnor to receive less considerat. on than Rutland ?" " Why are Welsh prosecutors, attorneys, and witnesses to he carried from home over such an extent of country" as they will have to traverse if the assizes for Carnarvonshire and Anglesea and for Denbighshire and Flintshire be amalgamated " Wby is Wales to lose her existing rights ?" Niow, surely the fact that Rutland continues, very unnecessarly, to have a separate assize can formu no logical basis for an argument that these Welsh counties should each of them continue to have one also. The proper mode of reasoning would seem to be to look at the facts of each case, as disclosed in the stz'ements made to the commissioners, and to see whether a great economy of time and expense wiU not be effected by the proposed changes, without any appreciable inconvenience to anybody whose convenience ought to be considered. To talk of " existing rights" in such a case seems, with deference to my Lord 'owis, litt'e better than no sense in the garb of patriotism. First, as to the case of Ca'narvonshire and .Anglesea. It appears from the retuin frrnisbed to the commiss;oners by the Clerk ofAssizeoZ the North Wales Circuit that in 11 years (from 1845 to 1856 inclusive) the total nunber of prisoners tried at the assizee of the former county vas 185, or less than 17 per ar!nnm: of tbe latter county 159, or aboot 14l per aranum; while the total number of causes tried in the same period was, in Carnarvonshire, (;S, or about 6 per annum; in Anglesea, 16, or 1 per annum ! for which business six days (for the two con;3ties) have been taken at each assize, while the time actually occupied bv the business has not averaged three days, the rest being filled up with travelling. opening commission, and other formalities, and seeimg the country. It is proposed, therefore, that these tvo counties should be consolidated, and tbat the assizes for both shonld be held at Bangor, instead of at Carnarvon and Beaumaris. Bangor is distant from Carnarvon 10 miles by railway; from Beaumaris seven niles by road, and about tbree by ferry. Such is the " extent of countrf' over whioh Welsh prosecutors, attorneys, and witnesses would in this ease be casried. Next as to Denbighshire and Fintshire. The assises ae now held at Rutbin for Denbighshire, at Mold for lintshire, these townrs being 10 miles apart, and there beirg a railway from Mold to Chester (12 miles). In the same 11 years 22S prisoners. or 201 per annrum, were tried at the Denbighshire assizes; 169, or upwards of 15 per annum, at the Finttshir. assizes. At the former, in the same period, 70 causes, or six and a fraction per annum; at the latter, 51 causes, or less than five per ann,um, have been disposed of, a week being taken for the busine of the two places at each assizes, but ess than f our days on an aTerage occpied bry It. Ti^e commissioners, under the.-e cirumetances, prypos& tbattheasizes for tetwQ countiessbalU beheldalrnatelI at Ruthin and at Mold. I Wish they had gone futher, andh proposed that they should be held altogether at Ruthin, wbich occnpies the very oentre of the two counties, at, which tnese is a good court, and to which there w1) shtly, no doubt, be a line of railway through Deabigh. Mr. Strong, the clerk of assize, sasa -- I hawe known 'a judgo be on circuit a fortnight wathou' hiving been 12 hours in court, and half that time ex ,edri cs 'ing o,-er namnes of sa, istrates and waitiDg the gramd jur7 to fi.d bills."

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (FRtOM OUR OWN Co RsPONDEWT.) rThG following appeared in our second edition of yeas PARIS, T=UR1D)Y, OcT. 1, 6 pm.. Although not one of the most important, neither is it one of the least interesting circumstances of the Stuttgar'c interview, that it afforded the persons present an opportunityof correcting their eatmate of the characters of the Emperor and Empress of Russia, as yet not much known beyond their o-ni country and some of the German States. During the lifetime of his father, whose great figure filled the whole foreground of the family picture, one heard very little of the heir apparent beyond the occasional capricious sketch of some literary rambler In Russia. It is only since the peace that there has been a chance of knowing much about him and of forming an estimate of his character, concerning which the European public does not seem yet to have adopted any very decided idea. On the other hand, we hear the Empress spoken of as a person of great declsion and ability, and as occupymng herself no little with politics, for which she is said to possess a superior capacity. We learn to-day that she accompanies her husband to the Weimar interview. It is gratifying to infer that she has completely recovered her health, the state of which, only a few weeks ago, condemnned her to absolute repose at Darmstadt Her visit to Weimar is a novelty; it was not expected that she would assist at this second meeting of Emperors, any more than it was known, until within a few hours of her arrival at Stuttgart, that she was to be present at the first. To Weinar, however, she goes, and with a good right if, as is believed, she had much to do in bringing about themeetingwith Francis Joseph. There is talk of an occult negotiation, carried on for some weeks, but as nothing very certain seems known on this head we neednot, perhaps, go farther back than the visit toAlexanderof Gseneral Pared, charged with a complimentary mission. There seems to have been then an expression of a reciprocal desire on the part of the two Emperors that they mipght some day meet, but without the suggestion of a definite time or place. The Empress, well informed of what passed, is said to have then opportunely interposed to convert a vague project into an immediate certainty. She had long, as I am assured, seen with regret the estrsngement between the Courts of St. Petersburg and Vienna, and had resolved to seize the first opportunity of putting an end to it. As regards what passed at the Stuttgart interview, I am indisposed to dwell upon many of the numerous current reports, most of which are doubtless founded much more on conjecture, or on very slight inferences, than on authentic information. It is said that among the projects mooted and discussed was one for the establishment of a permanent conference amongst the great Powers, for settling by arbitration all differences that may arise In Europe. This would completely harmonize with a rumour mentioned some time ago, that a reduction of standing armies would be among the questions debated between the French and Russian Monarchs. I must repeat, however, that it is the opinion of many personz here who certainly do not belong to the war party, that the French army could not safely be materially reduced from its present strength, which is required, they say, not for defence against foreign foes, but for the maintenance of tranquillity at home. It is for thia purpose that Paris has a garrison of 40,000 men, and many of the provincial towns proportionately large ones. Algeria, although all the recent accounts from it are favourable, and represent the Arabs as daily becoming more habituated to foreign rule, is still considered to need an army of 60,000 men. To return to Stuttgart. It is reported that the Queen of Greece there received the most friendly assurances from the Emperor of the French, and that the unlucky little country is likely to recover the good graces of France and E1ngland. This report is based on the fact that the Emperor Napoleon, who is extremely amiable with everybody, and appears to have made an excellent impression on the distinguished party at Stuttgart, is thought to have been particularly gracious to the Queen of Greece, writh whom, during his short stay, he had more than one conversation. It is presumable that it is from small indications of this kind, which, after all, may have little political significance, that spring most of the statements confidently circulated by some foreign journals as to what passed at the interview. And this reminds me to mention that, notwithstanding the positive contradictions contained in some of the German papers, there is no doubt that the French Government has declared itself in favour of iDenmark in the question of the Duchlee. tThe report I yesterday spoke of, that M. Thouvenel desires to be relieved, as soon as it can conveniently be done, from his duties as Ambassador at Constantinople, is confirmed to me to-day. It appears that for some time past this has been his wish, but that his Government, well satisfied with his conduct and exertions, has hitherto refused compliance with It. I hear that he has even been denied leave of absence, because it was feared that, once in France, ho would prevail upon the Emperor to change his post. The exceptional nature of Constantinople diplomacy is not to his taste, nor, probably, does he feel himself qualified by his character, which is rather bruspte, or by his experience in other countries, for dealing satisfactorily to himself with the supple, Intriguing, procrastinating Turks. 14. Scheffer, first dragoman to the French Embassy at Constantinople, has arrived in Paris on a special mission. Despatches have been received at the Forelgnoffice from the French Minister in China. They represent the situation of affairs as unfavourable, and announce positively that the Court of Pekin will not agree to any arrangement. A subscription is getting up in Paris towards defraying the expenses of the monument that is to be erected at Turin to the memory of Daniel Manin. It was thought that the French Government might object to this, but I hear that it is not the case, and that the first subscription lists will appear in tomorrow's papers. The Rerme des De=ar Momles, in a sketch just published, does justice to the many fine qualities of the former President of the Venetian Republic, to his integrity and courage, to his mnvearying exertions and virtuous aims, and, -while differing from his views, truly declares that it would be the greatest injustiCe to confound him with the mob of revolutionists, with fanatical agitators like Mazzini, for that of 3ll the Italians it was he perhaps who, with King Charles Albert, most faithfully did his duty In 1848. The Rlmtc says:- " Ee knew how to make a sacrifice of his opinions; he sought sincorely that which was possible, and placed the national independence above everything. He was not of those strange sectarles who would willingly Immolate their country to their dreams, and who are the first enemies of Italy, In this respect MaIn differed entirely from Mazzini, and, as has been seen In reoent times, the influ. ence he exercised beyond the Alps was of quite an opposite nature. Whatever might have been the illusions of tho former dictator of Venice, ho know how to make himasef esteemed for his character, and he leaves a name which recals one of the most attaching opisodos of tho ootem. porary revolutions of Italy." In addition to its usual summaries and current reflections on the news from India, the Tounml dus Dgbats has been giving at intervals a series of articles on the subject of the Insurrection, from the pen of xL Xavier Raymond, who displays an acquaintance with our language, and a knowledge of the subject he treats, which some few of his brethren in the Paris prAss might well envy, and wot ld do wisely to endeavour to acquiire. In an article that appears to-day he touches on the origin of the Sepoy revolt, and expresses the following opinion concerning it:- " We still believe that these events are scley the conqtences of a mlitary conspiracy, In which the Sepoys have alone taken part, and which had no other aim than to place the splendid pay and elevated rank of the EnglHsh offiers in the hands of their subadars and jemadars. We detoct no trace of fanaticism, in spite of the cartidge question, and we observe no Indication of the slightest shadow of patrotism. At the same time, no sympathy for the movement has been mafested by the population. The indifferenco with which the latter ha contemplated passing events is most remarkable, and ought to farnish matter of reflection to thowe who perdst In attrilbiting the Sepoy revolt to a national movement. Since the Sepoys have been masters of all the provinces wbich coin. pose tho Vice-Presidency of Agra, Inhabited by 40 or 50 mllion souls, not a single levy of men or money hae been made, not a band of volunteers has been organized, not a single town or village, even of those oocupled by the insmr. geni, has proved by a dgn or a step that it has joined the movement," Although the date fixed for the raising of the Chblons camp is the 15th inst., the Mhiater of War bas received orders to take mesaures for supplying the troops with rations until the 20th if required. Those members of the family of Orleans now in England, but who do not habituaUy live there, are about leaving, with the exception, as I am informed, of the Duchess of Orleans, who purposes remaining for the winter, and who is eFxpected to reside in the neighbourhood of Richmond. A letter from Odessa, of the 20th ult., informs us that the house of Baron Reneaud, in Richelieu-street, having taken fire, the conflagration spread and reduced three of the largest warehouses in the city to ashes. These were the English and French stores of G. Gornl, containing silks, cloths, furniture, glass, and other articles; another store belonging to MM. Steifel, Brothers, containing metal articles of English manufacture, muskets, pistols, agricultural machines &c. ; and a third, containing pianos fromParis, Vienna, andMarseilles.

THIE IMPERIAL NMETING AT WEIMAR. (BY SUBmA X AND RBxrIsu TL GAPH.) We have received the following telegram from our Vienna correspondent:- "Y VIENNA, FRIDAY MIomuxG, OCT. 2. The YieVna Gazette says-- " When the Emperor Francis Joseph called on the Emperor Alexander at Weimar the latter went to meet His Majesty on the staircase. Ha-ving embraced and klssed each other, their Majesties conferred for some time together.' "
THE IMPERIAL MTING AT STUTTGART. (FROM OU. SPECIAL COO,SPONDENT.) liu L"*Atvr, t3EPT. :2U. In the reports whioh I have hitherto sent you from here I have confined myself almost exclusively to the externals connected with the arrival of the two Emperors of France and Russia at this Court, and the more considerable events that have taken place during their stay here. To have attempted a political statement of what was going on between the Emperors within closed doors and without witnesses, as has been the case here, would have required a bold stretch of the imagination, but it might perhaps have been made more interesting than what I am about to forward you now as a political rgsumm of the long-talked-of meeting of the two Emperors at Stuttgart. During their stay here of four days each they have been in each other's company at least twice a day, but in the presence of others; what, however, is more to the point is, they have been closeted together three times perfectly alone for periods varying from one hour and a half to two hours each. The last of these interviews took place on their return from the Volksfest at Cannstadt yesterday, when they retired to the apartments occupied by the Emperor Alexander at the top of the Crown Prince's villa, and remained together for nearly two hours, at the expiration of whiclh they took leave of each other with the greatest apparent satisfaction at their having made each other's acquaintance. On Sunday afternoon also Prince Gortschakoff and Count Walewaki conferred together for more than an hour and a half; and, doubtless, have had other meetings, of which I know nothing, since Prince Gortschakoff has in the palace made no secret of his dissatifaction at so much time being wasted in gadding about that there was none left for business. Count Nesselrode, who is here, and had arrived here some time before the Emperor, has not taken any overt part in anything like business, but it is understood that both the Emperor and Prince Gortachakoff frequently recur to his advice and experience. The general rkume of the information I have been able to collect with reference to the nature of this meeting and its political results amounts to this,the two Emperors have had the satisfaction of making each other's acquaintance and of exchang. ing the expression of their individual views, wishes and aspirations, but nothing beyond this has been obtained, except it be some matters of such very trifling moment as not to be worth citing in connexion writh this event. What little I have learned shows me that, however much satisfaction the Emperor Napoleon may have experienced at the overtures made to him, and however gratifiedche may be by the homage thus paid to the position he has acquired for France in Europe, and at the additional prestige these events will give him in the eyes of his own people, he has not betrayed any inclination to jeopardize or to tamper with the English alliance, which he looks on as fundamentally essential, within certain limits, to the well-being of France and hisown stability. The idea which has been frequently expressed in the press of late, that one object of the understanding to be arrived at by the two Emperors was the reduction of both their armies, is evidently without substance, inasmuch as the reduction of the Russian army to a very low peace footing (with the exception of the detached armrne corps in the Caucasus and about the Caspian Sea) had already been ordered, and the nature of the reductions published in St. Petersburg, before the Emperor left, and consequently could not be made the subject of further negotiations; while, on the other hand, however sincerely Louis Napoleon's aphorism " L'Empire c'est la paix" may be meant with regard to foreign countries, it is highly improbable that he will, for many years to come, consent to a reduction of his military force. In the matter of popularity both with the Court and the people the Emperor Napoleon has made infinitely greater progress than the Emperor Alexander. The latter, who Is here perfectly en pasJ de cownaissance, and among relati ins, has not given himself the trouble to pleaso, which a stranger generally will; and by those who entertain French sympathies, and would gladly have seen the Empress Eugenie here, it is taken very much amiss of hin that he should have given way, as it is said, to female weakness, and have allowed the Empress to decline to come hither until it was a settled thing that the Empress Eugenie would not come, on which she pops in at the last moment on the pretence of giving her husband a surprise. It is assumed that the Empress of Russia and her sisters-in-law were averse to the Empress Eugenie's appearing here, from the apprehenslon that her greater youth, beauty, and mental attainments would throw them into the shade and compel them to acknowledge the personal superiority of one on whom they look down as inferior to them. Something of the same sort of feeling the Emperor Alexander evidently entertains towsard the Emperor Napoleon, who exhibitb more attractive manners and greater powers of conversation than himself, seeks more to ingratiate himself with others rides better, &c. The latter had, moreover, brought his own horses with him, so that while Louis Napoleon yesterday was mounted on a splendid high-mettled horse, that curvetted and sprang about to the delight of the multitude, the Emperor Alexander had to put up with an animal whose qualities were simply strength and docility. The Emperor Napoleon h&s lost no opportunity of showing himself in a light acceptable to the people; he has walked out In the streets arm-in-arm with a single gentleman, a Wurtemberg ofricer; he has tak-en or feigned an interest in al that the King is most fond of promoting, and for which'he is so deservedly popular, and gave himslf the trouble to sit out the whole of Weber's Der FreisCj,t, last night, which was played at his Tepdal desire to hear a genuine German opera, ancd oontinued applauding even after the curtain had fallen. |The absence of the Prince of Prussia from the grand doings that have been going on here for the fast few days has been misunderstood by several persons here as though he had desired to come hither, but that this Court had been unwilling to see him here, as likely to spoil sport. But the real state of the case in this,-the King of Wiurtemberg, on finding that the Kingof Prussia declined coming himself, invited him to send the Prince of Prusia to represent him, which, however the King was disinclined to do, from an unwilingness that he should take any part in a r9union the possible object or result of which might be a coalition prejudicial to German interests. The representatives of the smaller States in the south of Germany do not conceal their satisfaction at the attempted approximation of the Emperorx of Russia and France having been productive of so little binding result, inasmuch as a coalition of those two Powers, at a moment when England is too much occupied elsewhere to admit of her throwing her influence into the scale, is the constellation most productive of danger to Germany; and in the same proportion they are gratified at the approaching meeting of the Emperors of Rusaia and Austria, as likely to produce an arrangement which would remove every source of disquietude to Germany from the side of Russia. The Emperor Louis Napoleon and his suite, the Grand Duchess Helena, and Prince August of W&rtemberg, all left here this morning, and Stuttgart is rapidly relapsing into the quietude it enjoyed before the arrival of the Emperor. AUSTRIA. (momR 0 OWN CORFScM"O'Mm.) VIENNA., Sm. 29. The Emperor left Vienna for Dresden and Weimar at 12 o'clock lasc night, but he will not reach the last mentioned city until the lt of October, as he purposes passing four-and-twenty hours in the capital of Saxony. After his Interview with the Emperor Alexander His Mfajesty will return to Prague, and then proceed by way of Budweis to Iseh", where he will remain until the end of October. Count Buol, who left yesterday for Carlsbad, with one of his secretarles, has been desired by the Emperor not to trouble himself about politics until his health is restored. The business of the Foreign. office wlll be carried on by Baron Werner, the Under Secretary of State, during the absence of the Minister. It is now generally known that Count Buol is in as great favour with his Sovereign as ever, and Baron Budberg and his suite are accused of having sent a canard (a Muscovy duck) into the world when they related that he had tendered his resignation. I cannot hear that anything unusual Is going on in Italy, but th:s Government evldently suspects the French Cablnet of having formed plans unfavourable to the rule of Austria in Lombardy. Many of the principal Lombard nobles went to Paris shortly before the Governor-Goneral made his entry into Milan, and almost all those who are now in the city keep aloof from the Archducal Court. It appears to me-a dispassionate looker-on-that the Lombardo-Venetian nobles would serve their country better by making a friend of the Governor-General than by rejecting his well-meant advances. His Imperial Highness, who is benevolent, charitable, and hospitable, is evidently inclined to benefit the people placed under his rule, but their behaviour is so repulsive that it is almost impossible for hirato do so. A foreigner who has long resided in Milan says that the Archdukemight perhaps become popu- lar "if it were not known that he is so warmnly at-| tached to the Jesuits, who are as much abhorred by the Italians as by the Germans." A short time ago the Archduke made a second donation of 10,000 I lire to the charitable institutions in Milan. Wihin the last few weeks some 600 or 700 Italian refugees have been landed at Tunis, and the Neapolitan Government much fears that they intend to make a descent in SicUy. Some time dnce the Emperor made a donation of 100 ducats to the "Schiller Stiftung" ("Schiller foundation") at Dresden, and very angry are the ALustrian Jesuits that His Majesty has done so, those saintly gentlemen bemg of opinion that the works of Gcethe, Schiller, Leasing, Herer, &c., ought to be burnt, and their names, consigned to eternal oblivion. The representatives of the Catholic Associations have talked a vast deal of nonsense at Salzburg, and some of the propositions and resolutions of the Assembly clearly prove that Ultramontanism wili not take root even in Austria. At its first general meeting Dr. Vdsen, of Cologne, roused the lndig nation of the Assembly aga;nst the Protestants, by stating that one of their newspapera had more readers than all the Catholic organs of the press put together. As it was known that some of the members of the Assembly would endeavour to have more than their due share of talking, It was settled beforehand that no one should be allowed to speak for more than 20 minutes, and as the regulation was rigorously enforced, some little business was transacted. The following propositions were made:- " L That the Austrian Catholic University be caUed the Salzburg University. (This proposition was unwaimously accepted.) 2. That the establishment of seminaries for boys be recommended. (The proposal was not seconded.) 3. That certain Catlolic newspapers be recommended to the public. (This motion was rejected.) 4. That a catalogue of good books sxould be pubUshed. (Rejected, because the great quantity of materials would make the job what is commonly called a 'tough' one.) 5. That every person joining a Catholio Association should make a vow neither to buy nor to read a bad book. (Rejected, as being calculated to deter people from joining the Catholic Associations.) 6. To take measures for having the incorrect statements of the press corrected. (Rejected, because the individuals wronged canl defend themselves.) 7. A contribution of 150 or 200 floris to be made for correcting the misstatements of the press. (Rejected, because 200 florins would not sufflcoe to defray the expense ' of contradicting tho lies of one bad newspaper.' ") The Yolksfreund, the organ of the Vienna Jesuits, professes to be delighted with the proceedings of its friends, and is of opinion that their resolutions will lead to the most beneficial results. During the debates at Salzburg one of the speakers asked the Assembly whether it was aware that there were 184 Protestant to every six Catholic newspapers. Things have entered into a new phase in that part of Bosnia which lies between the rivers Bosna and Drina. The oppressed Rayahs are beginning to display hostility towards the Roman Catholic and Greek hierarchy. In the Posavina, a Franciscan friar was obliged to seek safety in iiight, and the Metropolitan of the Russo-Greek Church was menaced by the people. Troops have been sent for and are daily expected. The cause of the animosity of the Rayahs to their Christian superiors is, that they, without the knowledge of the people, promised to pay certain taxes to the Porte at the time that the Tanzimat was introduced into Bosnia. We learn from Cattaro that the Pasha of Scutari (in Upper Albania) has sent a strong body of troops against those mountaineers on the southern and eastern frontiers of Montenegro who have assumed a kind of independence and refuse to pay tribute to the Porte. Prince Daniel at first promised to give assistance to his neighbours, but it appears that he has reconsidered the matter, for he remains perfeetly tranquiL The Commission of the riverain States has finished its labours, but it is not very probable that all the resolutions which have been taken wil be to the taste of the European Conterence. When the question was that of signilng the closing protocol, a dispute arose between the representatives of Turkey, Moldavia, and Wallachia as to which should first affix his name to it, but eventually the important question was settled by the delegate of Bavaria, who proposed that the representatives should sign according to the position occupied by their different States on the Danube. Thus Wurtemberg would sign first, and Moldavia last. There have been so many contradictory reports relative to General Skrzynezki in the foreign papers that it may be well to state that a year ago the Emperor gave permission 5' to M. Skrzynezki, a Belgian Lieutenant-General on half-pay, to reside and to travel to and fro in Gallicia." On the 25th the "M Molo del Sal" at Trieste fell in, but no details on the subject are yet known here. The arsenal at Pola is not to be on such a grand scale as was originally proposed, but still it wMl be quite as large as is necessary for the requirements of the Austrian fleet. The Staff of the Marines has been removed from Triesteto Pola, and it Is very probable that the supreme command of the Naval Department will soon follow it. On his return from Berlin, Dr. Joseph Sz6kac, the pastor of the Protestant community at Pesth, related to his friends that the Hungarian members of the Evangelical Alliance had returned thanks to King Frederick Wiliam for the $6,000 which had been ralsed in his States for the support of the Protestant church and schools In Hungary. As the national cry of "Ejen 1" was afterwrards raised, the King express,ed his pleas,ure to hear it addressed to him, and observed that he should always, have a
TEE INDIAN MUTI2NIS. The following is from an officer in the Engineers "Camp Delhl, Aug. 8. "My dear Father,-I think you hardly know oarpresent position. It is a pretty mesa John Company has got himself Into. After all it is only what one might have erpected considering how the Sepoys were treated. Anytbing that they objectod to was given up at once. The greateAt care was always to be taken not to offend them. It was againat their casto to do this, that, or the other, and unless they chose they never did do it. They declared it was utterly impossible for them to use the Enfleld cartridges, yet they have shot down many a poor fellow of ours with these very cartridges. It does not seem to be against their caste now. We are very anxious to see howpeople at home take all this, The articde in 7iesTimesabout dlsbandingthe19thEegiment 'was very good. They say we ought to knowr more of our nnen, be more with them, &c. With European soldiers an 9fficer alwAys goes into their barcks, looks at their dinners, plays cricket with the men, and of course comes to know them. That is simply a consequenee of their both being Europeans. To do the same with Bepoys ire must turn Hindoos or something of the sort, for under existing circumstances you might be 'court-martaled' for going near a Sepoy while he is feeding-as that takes away his caste. Going into his hit is perfect profanation, or perhaps sacrilege; neither may you touch Any of his cooking materials or utensils, or even the wood he is going to cook with. They had become so pampered that they would hardly stand being spoken to, If after all this we ae obliged to have Sepoys again I hope they will be a different lot and treated in a very different manner. They have proved themselves thorough curs. They can murder helpless women and children bravely, but a handful of armed Europeans frighten them outright, and they always have avoided plges where perhaps 30 or 40 armed Europeans have been collected Look, for instance, at Roorkee. The 100 soldiers (coltege students) there have kept all that part of the country quiet, and Roorkee Itself Is untouched. At Delhi they are five or six to one against us, and see the mniserable attempts they made to turn us out of our position. They have swarmed up the heights In front of our battories by thousands. The ground is so broken and full of ravines and rocks that they can come up the whole Way uneen, or you may depend upon it they would never venture, If they had the pluck of a goose their numbers might terrify us; hub they never come near us, and only show themselves off at a distance, firing their muskets into the air, shouting moet awfully, but doing nothing more. It Is in the ' Subzee MIundee' that all the hard fighting goes on. They get into, and on the tops of houses, and, fire into our pickets thero. This goes on until we send a force from camp to turn them out, which we invariably do, but not without some 5les. We have now cleared the groxnd all around of the trees, walls, and houses. The consequence is, there is a large clear space around our pickets, and 'IPandy ill not venture out of the cover; so we generaUy let him pop avay from a dlstance until he is tired. If you hear people talking ofur not being able to take Delhi, you must deny it, simply be. cause we have not made any attempt to do so. I have no doubt, too, that It is the best policy, for, While there is a Delhi to slink to, all the rebels wMl flock there instead of running wild about the country, where they would do mucE more harm. Besides, we shaU have them all in a lump and be able to polish them off at otce. we-I mean ou particular corp-have had very hard work sinoe it lef; Meerut. We have lost 3 officers and had 2 wounded, and out of 45 European Sappers we have lost 15 and 3 wounded. The list of officers kIlled and woundod before Delhi amounts to upwards of 90, besides those who have been obllged to leave on aecount of sickness This shows the officers have not been behindhand in any fight or scrimmage. I think I never told you how splendidly the ladies behaved at Meerut. You should have seen them to appreciatet he whole thing,-how cheerfully they took every mishap. Though they were all packed within a smallish square place surrounded by high brick walls none of them ever grumbled or apparently became frightened. On t;he contrary, they used to be dancing about the place (we were at work fortifying It), offering us tea and all sorts of refreshment. It was warm work looking after the coolies who were taken as sappers, all the originals having gone off to Delhi. The rains have regularly set in row; all the low ground about Metcalfe's house is flooded. A strong stream now runs in theJumna,andwe are goingtotake advantageof it and try to destroy the bridge of boats. Several methods have been talked of. Yesterday we started three infernal maohines, consisting of a tub containing 501b. of gunpowder; a piece of stick was stuckup outside, which, if It came in4ontaot withanything, fireda pistol inside. We made a boat, also, and started them as near as possible in the middle of the stream. One went off on an island in the river and did nobody any harm; another was stranded and didn't go off at all; and no body knows what became of the third. So our first attempmust be considered a failure. I hope we may do better next time. We have been raising a corps of Sikh Sappers and Miners, Some of the companies have already arrived here but they are not of much use, as they are qu!th untrained. As it is, all our work is done with coolies, whom we have dignified with the name of pioneers. Among the houses at this station were a few flat-roofed ones which were saved in the general confagra. tion. In one of these we have established ourselves very comfortably. An old wooden billiard table forms our me13 table. We have managed to loot a punkah, and are much better off than those who live in tents, while our park is in the next compound. " Lord Ellenborough was not very far out when he said in the House that if we didn't mind what we were abo It we should have one of the most bloody revolutions in India. We are all very happy here, only a little anxious to get into Delhi and have a real slap at the ' Pandies.' You may be assured they Will catch it when the assault does take place." The following is from an Artillery officer:- "Camp, Delhi, Aug. 10. "We are in much the same state as when I last wrote. The last reinforcement from up-country, censistlng of 1,400 more Europeans, will be in in about a week, and then we do not know whetber the assault will take place at once, or whether we shall wait for Sir Patrick Grant. I hope we may, as I should not like to punsh these villains by halves. Our men are mad to get at them. We have been very much annoyed by their guns lately; they have taken up a new position on the right, which completely enfilades several o F our batteries. An expedition, fin which I was to have had two guns, was in orders, but was countermanded as the ground is excessively bad, and they were afraid our 103s would be very heavy. For the last three or four days we have had very heavy firing on both sides. We expend about 100 rounds per gpn, and you can imagine how they blaze away when the day before yesterday 450 round shot were picked up which they had fired. Two or three days ago 50 maunds of their powder blew up in the city. There has been much discussion in consequence, as they have accused the Prime Minister of having been concerned in it, and have got him prisoner. I continue very well, exc'pt a bad ear-ache, which comes on from being exposed at night, as the dew is very heavy, and we have no shelter; however we ought not to complain. The horse artillery duties are light compared with those of the foot; out of 157 men fit for duty we have 130 always on, so you can fancy what work they have with the heavy guns day and night. The engineers have been trying to blow up the bridge of boats with infernal machines, but at present have been unsuccessful, and I don't see that we gain much if we do destroy a boat or two, as the river is so low they can easily repair It. I believe the city will be given up to three days' plundor. I fear it will make our Europeans very undisciplined. Heaven knows, they are hard enough to control hore, but when they have once gone in like bloodhounds, and been allowed eo plunder, they will be downright demons,after the way in which the 6th behaved at Allahabad. embracing their officers, assuring them over and over again of their fidelity, and with tears entreating them to trust in them, tiUl the officers thought they might rely on men with whom they had been so long, and did so, and the result was they cut them all up in the night-26 of them, and some mere boys who had boen doing duty with them. rm sick of writing of massacres. The papers will give you circumstances I do not remember well enough to detail myself, At Peshawur I am happy to say all is as yet quiet, but I am very much afraid to hear bad news, more espcially of the 7th Irregulars, who were mutinously inclined. A goo I many of my friends are lying close by here in their graves, and several gone away sick. As long as youkeep well ndget shelter I think the weather is very pleasant, much more so than I ever Imagined the season could be in the rains, as at Peshawur this is the hottest and most trying season in the year. I fear this is a very uninteresting letter from a place where the eyes of Europe are conoentrated, but it will make you happy to know I am well, I am in hopes that we may be entitled to some extra batts, for we have had very hard fighting, and I hope we shaU meet wlth some reward." The following Is from an officer in the 6th Bengal Cavalry who La serving as a volunteer before Delhi : "Camp before Delhi, July 27. " my wife will have told you of my having come down to thLs army to see service. As I had nothing to do at Jullundur, and as it was more than one's temper could stand to be kicking one's heels Idle when service such as we are not likely to see again was going on here, I offered my srvices to General Nicholson and gained permission to join this force. I had, as I told you, rd a squdron of Sikhs at Tulundur, and the day after I had obtained leave to be off I received a telegraphic mesage from Sir J. Lawrence that I might take my squadron with me if I thought them fit to go. I paraded them, and seleted 30 of the best riders, and we marched off the same night to Phillour, 25 miles. We reached Umballah on the 8th, and should have been here on the 14th,but were detained at Kurnaul to escort ammunition into camp. Wo reached this on the 18thb and I was at once ordered to de duty with the 9th Lancers, being posted to Drysdale's troop. My Sikhs were made over to the civil authorltiws, And I am glad to hear are doing good work at Taneeput between this and Kurnaul. On the 19th we had a fight, but we were not engaged; on the 20th Brigadier Grant, who oommands the Cavalry Brigade, attached me to the Guide Cavalry, at which I am much pleased, as they are undeniably the best cavalry in camp-see, and I may say do everytbing. On the following day Charles S- came to me and said that the Adjutant-General had re. quested him to ask me if I would acept the command of the Jheon Rlajah' troops At first I dechned, but S-- told me that it was a compllment offering it to me; that Chamberlain had said that he regretted he had not a regiment to glve me; and, in fact, as the pogt is a responsible one I accepted it, and made arrangements to leave with Charles S- the same night. However, Brigadier Grant heard that I was off, and went to the Adjutant-General to protost against my being sent, as he said he could not spare cavalry officers, so here I am with my ruffian, and very glad too. Oar men are consummate scoundrels, but fight right wel ; they have but one fault, they are difficult to hold. On the 22d the enemy attacked our left, and I was ordered out with a squadron to reinforce the noar picket. I had not been there long when I received an order to go to the front to support the column going out to repulse the attack. I was placed at the front of the ridge which runs In front of our camp, with orders to remain there until I received further orders. I saw the whole of the fight from the Flagstff battery, which commands a splendid view of the city and ground between it and our camp. I was anxionsly expecting an order to move on, but no such order arrived. The fire was very heavy, and their round shot and shell came bowling through and over our troops, followed as they neared the city by grape, but not much damage was done. Soon the mnsketry began to slacken, and in half-an-hour the troops began to retire. Our loss was verybeavy in officers. Colonel - - mortally wounded, and five more officerswounded. The Infantry got up to within 30 yards of the enemy's guns, dx of which they had brought out to the front, but our fellows were pulled up by a brick wall and so had to retire They now for the first time make proper use of their Light Cavalry, and we Guides get lots of work. On the 23d of June the enemy got into our rear by crosing the Jumna Canal, some miles from our camp. To prevent a repetition of this gamo we have blown up all the bridges for miles np the canal. We now give a picket In rear of our camp to watch the bridges, and give speedy intelligence of any attempt on the part of the enemy to repair them. The officer patrols this three times a day, and as the dis. tanc round is 11 miles he go a ride of 33 mnles a-day. I was on this picket a few days Ago, and did A good stroke of business. On the opposite side of the canal, close to the bridge which it was stated ws to be repaired, Is a villae, the men of which I heard gave information of our movements to Delhi. I had reason to suspect that the enemyhad a picket there, so in the early morning I crossed some of my men over by a ford, marched into the village, and captured four out of six of the head men of the village. I took them off to my picket, and kept one of them, telling the others he was to bo relieved next day by one of themselves; that they were to give daily information of the enemy's movements in that direction; that if they did so they should be rewarded, but If they played us false that I would hang thedr hostage. This has had a good effect, and we now get information from the other dde of the canaL I am on the picket daty again to-night. We are anxiously Awaiting reinforcements, as nothing can be done until we get them. Nicholson with 4,000 men is expected on the 15th, and Lawrence with a large force of Sikhs will follow him. " This has been a fearfal business, and the loss of European hfe something frightfuL The awful atrocities committed on our poor unhappy women and children can never be forgotten. We must have bloodL The streets of Delhi will be a fearfl sight. Our men are mad for revenge, and there is not a soul who does not feel the same thirst for the blood of theseruffians. Threemonths ago I could not have looked on and seen 15 men tled up and shot down in cold blood without sickening, but I now swe my men do this in a most brutal way without a qualm. At a vilage on the Kurnaulroad a poor little child's feet were found; they had its little shoes and socks on, and some Devil in human form had cut them off with a tulwar. What death can be too cruel for such wretches ? We are much exposed, always ahead, and have already lost an immense number of officer In the Guides, and I fullRy expect to get a wound or two, but it wiU make me all the more interesting I Poor young Battye was kiLed at the head of my troop. My senior native officer is a very gallant feUow, and has distinguished himself on every occaSion. I have boen very much gratified by a most kind letter from my commanding officer after leaving the regiment. "Chalmers, who has been wounded by a shell, leaves tonight, as he wants change of air. Wounds cannot heal weU in this wet weather. We have had oholera in camp. Three officers died in one day, but there have been fewer cases during the last few days. Onr heavy batteries have just commenced their fire again, and the city gans are replying. I should not be surprised if they attack us this aiternoon, and we are aU ready for them. There are seven ladies now in Delhi. This is horrible to think of." "Camp before Delhi, August 9. Sinee writing to you lastI have been on my back for eight days. I wiU teU you how it aU happened. You must know that for some time past the enemy have been on the lookout to atback our rear, but to do this it was necessary to repair at leost one of several bridges over the canal which divides us from them, which said bridges we had blown up. On receiving intelligence of their intention we sent out a cavalry picket to watch the canal, and to give speedy information of any attempt they might make to cross. This picket was given to us as a post of honour, and it required a llttle gilt to make it a pleasant duty, as the officer on picket had to visit the bridge three times every day, besides riding to certain viUages in the vicinity to collect information, and before night the officer on duty had ridden his 33 miles. I was on this picket on the 31st of July, and had come back from my first patrol when, on reaching one of my videttes, he told mo that he had just passed a European woman with two chUidren escorted by some natives into my picket. I cantered on and overtook a country cart escorted by some villagers, one of whom carried a poor little boy about four years old on his shoulder. In the cart I found a nice looking young woman with a little infant. The poor creature seemed overjoyed to see an European face, and, in answer to my inquiries, told me that she was the wife of a Mr. Nun. son of the ridingmaster of the 1st Cavalry. Her husband was employed in the Customs' department, at a place near Guzgaon. When the ontbreak at Delhi took place he was in the district with Ford, of the CivU Service. Gnzgaon went with other stations, and this un happy woman was by herself, without a European near her. The instant the people of thevillage nearest her house heard that parties of Sepoys were coming in their direction they carried off Mrs. Nun, with her children, and concealed them in their vilage. Parties of horsemen arrived and inquired for her, and on being told that she had gone off plundered and burnt her house. To make a long story short, these poor fellows, at the risk of their lives, kept this unhappy family for three months, feeding and clothing them, and hurrying them off to other villages whenever they heard of the approach of any parties of the mutineers. I must tell you that the insurgents offered 100 rupees reward for Mrs. Nun, dead or alive, but nothing would tempt these simple ryots to betray their trust; and, finally, having seized an opportunity, they brought her safely into camp. The poor woman spoke most gratefully of their kindness and devotion, and the little boy seemed to have the greatest affec tion for the groy-hOaded old man on whose shoulder he was perched. I took them into my picket and gave them a good breakfast, and then passed them into camp as quickly as I could, as I had an alarm of cavalry in the neighbourhood. They had scarcely left when one of my videttes came gaUoping up to say that a large force was at both the bridges I had to patrol, and I had just turned out and mounted my picket when I received a despatch from camp informing me that a very large force of artilUery, cavalry, and infantry had left the city in the direction of the canal, and directing me to watch their movements. A troop of the Guides came up bt thlO moment under a young fellow named Craigie, and, taklng them with me, I galloped off to see what was going on. On reaching my advanced picket I left him there wi'h his troop, and went off with 25 men to reconnoitre. On nearing the first bridgo I found a large body of infantry lining the banks of the canal on our side, and a considerable foroe established in.a walled garden on the read,l about 200 yards in front of the bridge. I left my men and rode on to see if I could make out what the rascals 'were at, but they opened such a heavy fire of musketry that I gave it up. I remainod to watch their movementB for some time, and rode on towards the second bridge, about two miles further up the canal. The bank between the two bridges Ws crowded with infaantry, and they had a party of about 100 cavalry in front of the second bridge. During the whole time that this occupied It was raining ' cats and dogs.' I returned to my advanoed picket to write a report to the General, and found Hodson with a troop of his irregulars there to reinforce me. I toldhim all about it, and he rode into oamp to give my report, as it was impossible to write on a, for the rain &me down in torrents. MDonall, whom you all know, i&s 'with his troop; he was dotug duty with Hodson'a corpe, and we looked like a couple of half-drowned rats. We tried to Sight our pipes under shelter of the peak of our helmet, but we could not manage it. I then started off for the bridge a second time, aed at MDonall's earnest request allowed him to accompany me. We got up to the Serai, and found that the enemy were crossing, and had evidently found the day too juicy. We saw them across, and then went towards bridge No. 9. I saw some infantry in a garden, and can tered on to have a nearer look at them, when all of a sudden down comes my horse up to his chest in a buffalo hole. The whole of the coumtry was a sheet of water, so the poor beast could not see whatzhe was going at. He struggled and got his fore feet in the sides of the hole, but in making an effort to scramble up he reared and fell back on me, l oling clean over me. The pommel of the saddle and both Qf my holster pistols crushed my left side and completely knocked the wind out of me. However, I got up, shook myself, and Xisfying myself that no bones were broken, I flattered myself I was all right. "I wrote the above yesterday, but felt so tired after it, I was obliged to desist. I almost forget where I was. Well, after my fall we plodded on towards the second bridge, and found it occupied by a very large force of artillery, cavalry, and Infantry. Unfortunately my glass, the one I brought out, and a capital one it is, had got half full of water, and was perfectly useless, so I could not reconnoitre them as losely as I wished. We turned homeward4, and on reaching the picket I was truly rejoiced to see my relief waiting for me. I was doad beat, having been In the saddle for 14 hours, having during that time ridden upwards of 36 miles, and exposed to drenching rain the greater part of the time, with nothing to eat, and no smoke. I cantered home to camp to the Brigadier, and he gave me half a tumbler of cherry brandy, which warmed me considerably. I cantered home, feeling quite comfortable, and beyond a slght aching in my side I shoald not have known that I had come to grief. I got dry clothes and dined with Stewart, the Guides doctor, who wzs the only one at home, . . . No chance of taking this place for some time to come. Reinforcements march towards us, but they never seem to get nearer. It will, Indeed, be glorious when we rout and slay these treacherous cowardly hounds. They will be hunted down like wild beasts, and it is to be hoped few will escape. You In England can never know or hear one-half of the atrocities committed by these savages, for they are too abominable ever to repeat, much less to publish. We must have an enormous army to settle this country, and where is a new Indian army to spring fromr? . . . IL is dead, but I don't think I shall get my captaincy, as all promotion is said to be stopped. This is, indeed, hard. I can give You no account of camp, for I feel tired and weak, and writing on one's back is tedious and slow work. In a few days I trust I shall be in my saddle again. The following is fror an officer serving in the 1st Madras Fusileera:- " Camp Murragurwar, Oude, Aug. 4. "You already know that I embarked with my regimentn (lst Madras Fusileers) for Persia, but was recaUed,-peace having been declared. While we were at Bombay intelli. gence was received that two regirments were in open mutiny at Calcutta; this we all knew meant that 'the army of Bengal was goirg to rise at last,' and many were the small wagers won and lost as to whether our destination would ba Bengal or China. " Orders were at last receiTed that we were to return forthwith to Madras, and on our arrival we found that we were destined to garrison Bangalore (also Her Majesty's 43d regiment, Madras), but that owing to the cholera which was raging along the whole road, it was not considered advisable to effect the relief for a short time; a month elapsed, and the awful news of the Mecrut and Delhi massacres and an urgent demand for troops reached Madras at 12 o'clock at night on Saturday, the 16th, or Sunday morning. " I was awoke by our bugle sounding all over the fort for orderly sergeants, and I knew that the route had arrived for field serv ce, though I had not heard of the requisition for aid having been received during the night. " Shortly after daylight my father-in-law came to my quarters and told me the state of affairs, and that our corps was to be ready to embark for Calcutta by 10 o'clock a.m. It so happened that I was a member of a general court-martial, and was ordered to remain behind and proceed with six others of ours to Calcutta by the next mal steamer. " I arrived at Calcutta on the 2d of June, and found that my corps had proceeded to B nares. I foUowed them up by the grand trunk road, and reached Benares in four days, just a few hours too late to witness the utter defeat of the 37th Regiment, the 12th Irregular Cavalry, and a regiment of Sikhs, by 200 of Her Majesty's 10th, 30 of ours, and two guns. The morning I arrived some 300 of ours came in by river steamers, &c., and that afternoon we started (130 of us) for Allahabad in hopes of arriving in time to sava the fort from the 6th Regiment and 1st Oude Cavalry. The deed was done. I remained in Allahabad until the arrival of enough troops to form a column strong enough to advance to the relief of Cawnpore and Lucknow, both which places were belng gallantly defended by a handful of Europeans. General Havelook, C.B., arrived to comman d this column, v;hich consists, or rather consisted, of 400 Fusileers, 300 748th Highlanders, 400 of the G4th, and about 300 of the S4th, some 60 artillery. men (Royal Artillery from Ceylon), about 70 officers and staff sergeants that had escaped various massacres, mounted as Irregular Cavalry, and a regiment of Sikhs, which have hitherto remained stanch ; these constituted the little army that started from Allahabad to settle the North-Western Provinces of India and Oade. ' On the 12th of July we fought the rebels at Futteypore and thrashed them in four hours, after a 24 mile march in the sun-they were about 4,000 strong, and we took 11 guns from them. Two days after we had a smart affair with them at Oung, our regiment capturing two guns. We halted for some food after the action, and after having marched about five miles found them in possession of some rising ground beyond a river, the bridge of which was commanded by two long 241b. Iron siege guns in position. The Fusileers were again in front, and took the bridge with a rush and spik-ed the guns. That night we heard that Cawnpore had really fallen; we had heard at Futteypore rmmours of the sad event, but we hoped that it might be a rusc of the enemy to make us fell back to Ailahabad. We pushed on, and on the 16th fought the battle of Cawnpore, when we thrashed 7,000 of the rebels aided by several thousand city soamps and others armed with matohiocks. This was an awful day's work, and that night we slept at our arms, expecting hourly that they would again commencw the actlon; but they had had enough, and at daybreak the following morning they blew up the magazine and retired. Two days after the Fusileers proceeded to Bithoor, and captared without resistance 21 guns. Up to the 26th we were all busily engaged, crossin- guns and material over t> the Oade country, with a view of advancing to Lucknow to relieve the garrison 'which, under poor Sir H. Lawrence, has so gallantly defended itself for so long. He, poor man, died from the effects of a wound on the 4th of July, but the garrison, I am proud to say, still holds out against an attack of 40,000 men and some 40 or 50 guns. On the 29th we found our friends in position at Wonai, about 12 miles from the river, and we promptly attacked them, and licked them In our usual style -only 7,000 of ' em ;' and that night we had another affair about seven miles further on, at a place called Busarut Gunji, and on that day captured 21 guns. I am sorry to say that the enemy managed to recover two of them. Our loss was rather heavy that day, and the General fell back on this plaece the following day-I fancy for reinforcements and more ammunition; three guns came in this morning, and 60 of the 84th, but our losses havo been very serious for so small a force. " The enemy are now in position witih 23 guns, many of very heavy calibre, at Raj Gunge, having blown up a bridge and made themselves very strong. I fear it will be a bloody affair crossing this river. We (the Fasileers) have alreaoy lost two officers, and another is very dangerously wounded - Onr Colonel (Niell) has been made a brlgadier-genoral for his services, and now commands Cawnpore. Our senior major was kiWled at Oung, at least he shortly after died of his wound, and the regiment is now commanded by the junior major. I will not dwell on the various horrors And outrages committed by the rebels at the various stations where they have mutinied; suffice it to say that no such acts of treachery, villany, and barbarity stain the page of the history of any country. It is now war to the knife with every Mussulmsan in the country, and every Sepoy of any creed, against Europeans and all Christians. I have just heard that we are to march to-morro v morning. If we manage to get to Lucknow and back it w 1 be one of the moet wonderful feats of arms that have ever been accomaplished." The following is from an officer serving at Mozaffurnuggur "July 26.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMlES. Sir,-Although It is hardly to be expected that any more local news can find much place in your columns during the momentous struggle in India, yet I am sure you will think that hard earned laurels in other quarters should not entirely lose their little meed of praise. The following is the substance of extracts condensed srom the Hongkong Gazelle of April 29:- " Her Majesty's ship ampnson (Captain Hand) left Amoy on the '6th, after successfui operations of the utmost Importas ce. The native snd foreign trade has long seriously sulffered from the formida',le dleeta of piratee that Infeet the Chinese coast north of Amoy. The 8ampson, having received intelligence of recent acts of pirasy, eatled on tae 9th from Amoy. after de,troying several piratlcal junks, and among the rest EOins heavily armed junks which were in the act of eapturinc a Formosa riee junk. It was belleved that the main fleet of the pirates still remained intact. A cloee search Vas made, and behind a clump of rocks in Meichun i80y a nest of 2- junks and lorchas was found at anchor, thiir position strong and well-ebosen. The boataor the Sampson were at ovce ent off to the attack, red the nest boat and pinnace. cr'n maudeir by Lieutenant (leorge Wale, enteted the inlet, the other bsats foliowic.

When within 30 yards of the pirates the pinnace got aground under the concentrated fire of the pirate fleet. The LlongAong Gazete thus describes the critical conflict after the pmnace grounded:- " No timeo was to be Ist, and with undaunted spirit the First Lieutenant, Mr. Wale, at the heod of hIs mec, dasho I overboard and rushed on, waist-high in mud and water, amid a storm of ati.:kpots, gingalls, and volleys of every rinda: with a gallant dash they boarded. and were Immediatell foUowed by the otber boats' crews.

CHRISTIAZI2'Y IN INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have read with much interest the letters of your oorrespondent " P," upon the Important question he dis. cusses-our future policy in India,-and having,like himseo, passed a long officiai li.fe in that noble dependency ef the Bxitish Crown, but returned from it, I should imagine, somewhat more rccently, I should like to offer a few remarks upon his views if you could favour me with space. He advocates what ho rightly terms "the traditionary policy " of our Indian rule-that is, the policy of men like himself and Colonel Sykes, of the old Anglo-Indian school, -and he predicts, as all his sohool have done before him, on aU fresh occasions, the most dire evils, if there should be any departure from this policy. I had expected, in his second letter, that your correspondent would have met, In some measure at least, your most able, and, It would seem from his silence, unanswerable comment upon his first letter. I had looked for some clear exposition of the advantages which had accrued to us from this " traditionary policy." As the case now stands-and it was put most forcibly by yourself,-this policy, brought to the test of experienco, and read by the light of recent events, has proved an utter failure. It has had full scope for half a century. and what has been the result ? After all the proclamations, the support of Hlndoo temples and mosques, the dismissal of the native convert from the ranks of its Bengal army, the most rigid exclusion of a ray of Christian light from its places of education, and the entire negation on the part of the Government of its Christianity, what do we see? The Mussulman population and the Hindoos of caste in our army, whose feelings and prejudices have been so speciaUy indulged, arrayed against us with fiendish hatred and with an inf£riated b-gotry which nothing can at any future time surpass Had we been the most intolerant and grievous of oppressors on the face of the earth, respecting no man's religious feelings more than the Mussulman conqueror did those of the idolater, could we have reaped a more bitter harvest of hatred and revenge ? let, then, this question be answered by "'P.," What has been galned by this traditionary policy ? Until this is done I confess myself quite unable to appreoiate its value. But it will be said that it was not this policy, but the deviations from it, which lave brought down upon us this storm of fire. I wil now ask him to what deviations he refers. Let them be specified, and we shaU know what his views really are, and what he means, when he caUs upon us to uphold the policy for which he argues. If I may be allowed the remark, it is here that he manifests his igno. ranoe of the subject with whioh he is dealing. He seems to think that the Mahomedan and the Hindoo can and wiU enter into the notion that the British Government, though a Christian Government, is perfectly Indifferent to its own faith; that it neither cares nor desires to take a single step in furtherance of Christianity, or ,to bring about any change in the faith of its subjects. This is what, as I understand him, he is desirous to impress upon the Hindoo and Mahomedan mind by his traditional policy. My expe. rience of the Hindoo and Mahomedan has taught me, and it seems to mo late events teach the same lesson, that this is a vain figment. The Moslem and the Hindoo are earnest, not half-hearted bellevers, but bigoted foUowers of their own creeds; they cannot, therefore, and do not believe in all this indifferenoe to Christianity with which the traditionary policy clothes the Government, but of necessity they believe it to be a sham. They see the Government to be abolishlng suttee, and so interfering with the most ancient rites of their religion; they see them admitting into the country and protecting missionaries, and permitting them to make the most open assaults upon their religions, and to declare, by their toachings and by their tracts circulated through the length and breadth of 'he land, that both Mahomnedanism and Hindooism are false. The Mahomedan sees slavery (recognized by his Koran) doclared by law a crime; they see an education given by the Government, in wbich aU that their literature and science hold to be true is contemned as false and absurd, though contained in their sacred books; they see, further, the young men who receive this education practically rejecting and despising their faith; and, above all, they feel and know just as weU as we do ourselves that our domination in India as a Christian Power, with aU India now under our feet, involves in itself the uprooting and overthrow of their faith. 'T'he subtle Hindoo and "acute Mosiem" see this plainly, and they hold, as it seems to me, at its true value the unreal and flimsy profession of neutrality of the "traditionary policy." Accordingly, they have distrusted a Government which appe-rs to their eyes with a double face, and they have been prepared by this policy itself to accredit the "greased cartridge " or any other tale of Government duplicity and treachery which designing men may invent. It is my firm conviction that so long as this policy pre. vails, and we make therefore in India a profession of noninterference with the religions of the people, and yet at the same time aim at and propose to ourselves to introduce among them our own civilization, we shaU be mistrusted, for this civilization being leavened throughout with the spirit of Christianity, and cast in its very mould, Is in its nature antagonistic to and destructive of Mahomedanism and Hindoo semi-barbarism. Why, I would ask, are we now, after what we have witnessed, to persevere in this double-faced policy? Surely it is time to try something else, and to adopt a manly, open, and straightforward course, declaring ourselves and our Government frankly to be what we areChristian,-and leading the people to learn by ourwords and deeds what that means,-impartial justice to every man, from the highest to the lowest, and, as an essentialpart of that justice, perfect freedom of oonsciencs to every individual man or woman, be his or her faith or creed what it may, and of religious practises, so far as it is harmless to society. Before I close let me correct an error in your correspondent's statement. He repeatedly affirms that the British Government has pledged itself to " perfect toleration" and " non-interference." If he means by toleration what we understand by it in this country, the right of every one to worship his God or gods in his own famUy as he likes, and to hold what religious opinions he pleases, he is right. This British Protestant principle has been, and ever will be, I trust, the principle of our policy. Bat if he means more than this, and that we are pledged to a toleration of all the practices and usages which Hindooism and Mahomedanism enjoin as part and parcel of their religion, he misleads himself and others. The British Government has never acknowledged this pledge or principle, either by law or in practice; it has, on the contrary, repudiated it in express terms 25 years ago. Here are the words of the Court of Directors' and Lord Glenelg's despatch, February, 1833:- " We cannot conceive that a Government which believes these rites to be deeply founded in error, and to be productive, even in a civil view, of serious evil, is obhliged, or is at liberty, to show them any degree of positive sanction or encouragement." This, I thitak, gives a different view of the pledged poliey of the British Government in India from that-which those who read only your correspondent's statements would receive. I might point out other misapprehensions (as they appear to me), such as his supposititious case of the Rajah of Burdwan. I would ask him to apply his reasoning to an actual case-our Queen's deservedly honoured and frequent guest, Rajah Dhuleep Sing,-and let us have a practical decision; for I conclude that our old ally, his ancestor Runjeet, no longer gets his annual funeral cake and libation. Bat, seriously, if a modification of the law is, as " P ' says, required, not to sanction or support Hindooism, but to secure the ends of natural justice, let this be proved, and what Christian man will nnnoca ii. 9 AN ANGLO-INDIAN, NOT OF THE ___ OLD SCHOOL.

THE SAILORS OF THE NORTH-EAST PORTS.- SHIELDS, Oct. L-This day Is the commencement of the winter half-year in the coal trade, and there was some fear lest an unpleasantness might arise between the seamen and the shipowners, or that a strike might occur; but Eo far each party has taken Its separate course, and there is not much cause for alarm. The South Shields Shipowneres Association have intimated that its members win not pay more than 41. a voyage to London and Amsterdan; * 31. 1Osn per month in the Baltic and North American trades ; 31. per month in the Mediterranean and Black Sea trades, the four latter with small stores. The Sailors' Association have announced that their scale for the winter is 51. per voyage in the London trade, 41. per month in the Baltic and North American trades, and 31. 1Os. per month in the Mediterranean and Black Sea trades, with small stores when sailing by the month. The Shipowners' Association do not employ 'Union men, and the Sailors' Association, whose members are all able-bodied seamaen, decUno' to sail with non-Union meu. The Shipowners' Association only represents a portion of the Shields owners, but whether those who do not belong to the association wiU feel inclined to pay 11. a man a voyage more than the members of the association, or whether the association can procure crews fit to navigate vessels in tbe North Sea during the winter months at their reduced scale-for they have so far paid the same wages as those claimed by the Seamnen's Association-are questions that are likely to be soon settled.
CHARGE OF EXTORTION. Yesterday being tha day appointed for the hearing, at the Mansion-house, of the charge preferred by Sir R. W. Cardcn, the Lord M-yor elect, against Thomas Plant Rose, the court was much crowded. The Lord Mayor presided, and ther e were upon the bench the Lord Mayor elect, Mr. Alderman Carter, Mr. Alderman Hale, Mr. Alderman and Sheriff Lawrence, Mr. Deputy Dakin, Mr. Under-Sherlff Millard, Mr. Under-Sheriff Parker, Mr. Jonathan Thorp, Mr. Deputy Kebbel, and Mr. Goodhart. The defendant was charged, according to the summons, "for that he, on the 22d day of September last, unlawfully d:d threaten to print and publish, and did propose to abstain from printing and publishing, and did offer to prevent the printing and publishing of a certain libel, and also a certain matter and thing touching Sir Robert Walter Carden, one of the aldermen of the city, with Intent then and thereby ba extort money from him, against the statute 6th and 7th of Victoria, chap. 96, sec. 3." Mr. Humphreys, the solicitq, appeared in support of the prosecution; and Mr. Lowls*tended on the part of the defendant. Mr. Humnphreys stated the case for the prosecution, and called the following evidence:- Mr. G. W. K. Potter, one of the Secondaries of the city, said,-In the early part of last week, about Wednesday or Thursday, I entered my office in Basinghall-street, when I saw the defendant speaking to the clerks. He was inquiring for a register. I knew him very welL I asked him if there was likely to be any opposition to Sir I. Carden (referring to the election for Lord Mayor). He saicd, " Certainly ;' that he (Rose) had been appointed agent for the publicans, and that the sum of 4,0001. or o,0001. had been raised for the purpose of opposing Sir Robert; that he certainly would not come in, and that there certainly would be a poll demanded. I said I was sorry for that, it was a pity there should be. Sir R. Carden caUed upon me and I told him what had passed between the defendant and myself. Cross-examined.-TilI I solicited the defendant with respect to the opposition no conversation took place upon the subject. Mr. Jonathan Thorp.-I redde at Blackheath, and have ohambers in King-street, Cheapside. I am not in business. Some days before Saturday, the 26th ult., I asked the defendant, whom I met ii. the lobbv of the Gui.dhall, whether it was probable that Sir Robert would be opposed ? He said he thought so as 1,5oOL. had been subscribed by the publicans, and, of course, it would take 1,6001. to beat it, and Sir Robert did not seem disposed to spend any money. He added he was very sorry such was the case, for Sir Robert was a very good man, and ought to come in. On the following day I communicated this to Sir Robert, but I should say not seriously. I did not tell him that the defendant had said that 1,5001. had boen subscribed. Cross-examined.-I am not certain whether I myself com. menced the conversation. I heard frequently about the city that Sir Robert as to be opposed. Mr. Warren Stormes Hale.-I am an alderman of the dit of London. Previously to Saturday, the 26th ult., I had some conversation with the defendant upon the subject of the election. I think it was about a fortnlght before the election. I had occasionally had conversation with the defendant respecting elections, and asked him if there would be an opposition to Sir . Carden ; he sad there would, as Sir Robert was very obstinate. Mr. Lewis interposed, and submitted that evidence could not be adduced with respect to anything that took place upon any day other than that specified in the summons. The LORD MkyoR overruled the objection. Examination continued.-The defendant told me that there would be an opposition if an arrangement was not made with him. I then asked if any money had been sub. scribed. He said he knew there was 2,0001., and he made some allusion to the licensed victualiers. He ssid they were very angry. Imet Sir Robert a day or two afterwards aud then mentioned the conversation to him. Cross-examined.-I had had no previous communication with Sir R. Carden with reference to seeing the defendant. It was partly from inquisitive motives that I asked whether there was to be any opposition to Sir R. Carden, and I had no desire to see a contest. I was not professing to act as a friend towards Sir R. Carden. My reason for asking the defendant whether there was to be any opposition to Sir Robert was that he generally conducted the opposition. Mr. Henry Kebbel.-I am Sir R. Carden's deputy. Some days_reviously to the 22d ult. the defendant called upon me. l think he said thathe called to know whether anything was likelyto be done. I think that was the expression-that he suposed I knew the object of his visit. Mr. Humphreys.-And did you know the object of his Witness.-I suspected I did. I had no knowledge, but suspicion. (Laughter.) Mcr. Humphreys.-What further conversation took Witness.-I said that I had nothing to say to himthat I had not seen Sir R. Carden, but that I was to see him at half-past 10 o'clock, and that if he would call upon me at 12 o'clock I might have something to say to him. This took p lace on the 21st ult. He called upon me at 12 o'clock, and I told him that I had nothing to say to him, but that I should see Sir Robert again if he caled the next day. He accordingly caled again on the 22d, when I told him that I was not in a position to say anything to him, but that I still might be. At the first interview he produced a manuscript of a placard which he said had been sent to a printer by a publican of high standing. He gave no name. He said that he had caUed upon that printer, and asked to see thi6 paper; that the printer refused to let him see it, ut he happened to be his printer, and had printed for him for 20 years, and that he had then said tohim, " If you don't show it to me, you shall never print another line for me.', The defendant said that he himself had snatched the paper out of the printer's hands and put it into his pocket, at which the printer was very angry. Mr. Humphreys.-Is the placard now shown you an im. print from that manuscript . Witness.-I think it is a copy of It as far as the word "daughters," but I do not recollect the latter portion of it. The foUowing is the portion of the placard of which the witness spoke to having seen the manuscript:- "Whoarewetoiharefor Lord Mayor, fegow ittaens? This isjust now, with us, the important queetion. Shal it be sir Robert Walt_r Carden? No. Why? Beocuse his evidence on the inquiry into the Sunday opening of publichousse was offensive to ourselves as men and disgustingly so as it regarded our wive, and daughters.n" Mr. Humphreys.-Did any conversation take plate between you and him respecting the posting of the placard ? Witness.-Whether it was on the 22d or the following morning I cannot recollect, but at the last interview I had with him I said that Sir Robert would not do anything. He then said, putting out a paper-whether It was the paper I had seen or not r do not know,-" This shall be posted to-night, and Sir Robert is out and no mistake." Cross-examined.-No mention was made of money, excepting that he told me that 'certain sums of mone- had been collected by licensed victualers. There was a man at Islington and a man somewhere else. I did not pay any attention as to where they were. I looked upon it as a little bit of bombast and boast. I am Sir R. Carden's deputy. I had a conversation with Mr. Millard with reference to the defendant. This was before I saw the deo fendaut. The defendant told me that he had been sent to me by Mr. Mllard. Mr. Lewis.-Dld you have any conversation with Sir R. Carden with reference to the engagemen5 of the defendant? Witness.-Yes. Mr. Lewis.-Was that before you had had any interview whatever with defendant? Witneas.-Yes. Mr. Lewis.-How many days before you had had any interview with the defendant ? Witness.-I think the interview that took place when his name was mentioned was on Friday, the 18th. Mr. Lewls.-Was Mr. Millard present at that interview ? Witness.-He was. Mr. Lewis.-Was it proposed by, or in the presence of, Sir P. Carden a j that interview that the defendant should be employed as his agent ? Witness.-It was proposed that he should be employed? Mr. Lewis.-As his agent? Witness.-No, there was notlling said about being his agent. Mr. Lewis.-But it was proposed that he should be employed? Witness.-Yes. Mr. Lewis.--Who proposed it? Witness.-I think Ln the general conversation that both Mr. Millard and myself urged it. Mr. Lewis.-Proposed it? Witness.-I do not think we proposed it, but we urged upon Sir Robert that he should be emDloyed, to prevent trouble and expense. Mr. Lewis.-What, was his employment to be to prevent expense? Witness.-His employment was to pack the halL Mr. Lewis.-To pack the hail with what? Witness.-The 'long shore men. Mr. Lewls.-What was to be the remuneration as agreed on among you for this job ? Witness.-There was no remuneration agreed on. Mr. Lewis.-Was he to have any remuneration in respect of the services to be rendered? Witness.-Our proposition went to that extent. Mr. Goodman (chief clerk).-To the extent of remunerating the defendant for his services? Witness.-Yes. Mr. Lewis.-Was any sum agreed on? Witness.-I think not. Mr. Lewis.-Will you swear it? Witness-To the best of my recollection there was no sum. Alr. Lewis.-To prevent any mistake, may I take it for clear that Sir Robert Carden concurred in paoking the hall with 'long shoremen on that occasion? Witness.-Quite the reverse. The LORD MAYoR.-That shows that Sir R. Carden was not a party to this proposition at alL Mr. Lewis.-Now, will you tell me why you wanted Mr. Rose to come to you on three several days ? Witness.-That I might in the meantime communicate with Sir R. Carden. Mr. Lewis,-Did you state to the dafendant that you had the whole arrangement of the election ? Witness.-I very much question whether I went so far as that. Mr. Lowis.-Had you the arrangement of the election? Witness.-I thought I had, but it turns out that T had not. tor. Lewis.-On what day was your supposed authority to determine? Witness.-On the day that Mr. Millard and Sir R. Carden called on me, because Mr. Millard and myself thought we had wrung from SirRoberta reluctant compliance with what we -wished to carry out. I felt so uncertain about it (And I was going out of towA on the Frida nighti and d14 not intend to retu n til Monday) that I wrote from my residence at Blackheath to know at what hour on the Monday I could see Sir Robert, and there is his answer. (The witness handed in a letter from Sir R. W. Carden to himself, appointing Monday morning at half-past 10 for the interview). I called upon Sir Robert at his office at the specified time, when he repudiated altogether the idea that he had given me any authority to enLter into rmy arrangement with the defendant. At my first interview with the defendant I told him that I thought I had a carte blanche from Sir Robert, but that I found I was entL-ely mistaken. Mr. Lewis.-Was it ouprposition, as the depuLty of the ward, that the hal should be packed t Witness- I made no proposition of that sort", it was a perfectlyunesodti. Mr. Lewi.-There are many perfectly unperstood things. Witnes&-You cannot get away from what everybody appears to know. Mr. Lewis.-Was it your proposition, as the deputy of the ward, that the hall should be packed t Witness.-To Sir Robert Carden it was, because he was threatened with an opposition. AlD these things tel one upon another. Mr. Humphreys.-They dovetaiL Witness.-Yes. (Laughter.) Mr. Lewis.-It appears to be a custom. I think my friend said it was a custom. tMr. Humphreys.-I have never said it was a custom, and I hoped it was not. I would not believe it was a custom. I was in ignorance of it, only you have brought out the fact now. Mr. Lewis.-The object in packing the hall with the 'long shore men was to keep out the voters? Witness.-No; they are all voters. Mr. Lewis.-Bat to fill the hall on one side of the question ? Witness.-Yes. (Laughter), Mr. Lewis.-Now, do yon happen to know that the defendant voted for Sir R. Carden 9 Witness.-I did not see him in the hail. Mr. Lswi6.-As a matter personal to myself, I trust that this case, which must necesqarily last a long time, will be now adjourned. I have a most important professional engagement to keep. Mr. Humphreya.-There are other witnesses to be called, andIwish all the witneses now in*ttendance to be called and heard give their evidence before they leave this court. hfr. I.ewIs.-Then I cannot remain. I think it but an act of courtesy that my friend should yield to my request. Mr. Humphreys.-I would do anything courteous to m friend, but I must not sacrifice my client, and won't. I will be as saort as I cn I have the responsibility of conducting this case, and I indst upon Its goi on. mr. Lewis then lef t the court,. an nderstanding having been come to that he should have an opportunity hereafter of cross-examining any witnesses whose testimony might be taken in his absence. Mr. W. J. Mitchell said,-I am Inspector of the City Police Force. I received the placard produced aboat 5 o'clock on Wednesday evening, the 23d uit., from a person named Charles Benjamin, There waz a person named Thomas Tlheatley with him at the time. The LoRD MAYoR (to the defendant).-As your solicitor Is not present, you can put any question to the witness you think proper. The defendant bowed, but did not avail himself of his Lordship's offer. 'Charles Benjamin, a bill-poster, said he gave the last witness a placard similar to that which had been produced and spoken to by Mr. Depaty KebbeL Witness reoeived the bil from a Mr. Wheat ey. Thomas Wheatley, a bill-poster, aad.-I gave the last witness the placard produced. I got It from a gentleman in Guildhall-yard on the night of Tuesday, the 22nd alt. I had met the gentleman before, and was told to meet him there. I cannot Identify that person in court. Mr. Humphreys.-Do you see him in court to the best of your belief ? Look round. Witness.-Not to my knowledge. He was a stoutish man. I could not identify him. Mr. James Josiah Millard called and examined as follows - Mr. Hunmphreys.-You are, I believe, a solicitor, and your place of business is Cordwainers'-haU ? Witness.-It is. Mr.Humphreys.-Youare one of thepresentunder.sheriffs, I think ? Witness.-I am. Mr. Humphreys.-Now, previously to the election of the Lord Mayor on the 29th ult. did the defendant Rose caU upon you ? Witness.-After I sent for him he did. Mr. Humphreys.-Was there any conversation between you upon the saubject of the then forthcoming election? Witnem-There was. Mr. Humphreys.-Will you be good enough to detail that conversation. Witness.-I asked him what would be his retaining fee in the event of his being engaged as agent for Sir R. Carden, in consequence of the threatened opposition to the election of Sir Robert. His answer was he left it to me. I told him I was desirous he should name the sam. He being unwilling to do so, I asked Lim whether 1001. to cover all the expenses of the poll would be a sufficient remuneration, with the addStion of SOL, in the event Of Sir R. Carden's election. I said I would communicate that to Sir . Carden, and if his services were required he would be communicated with. Mr. Humphreys.-Do you recollect when that was ? Witness.-It was a few days before the 18th, when Sir Robert called on me; it was two or three days before Friday the 18th. Mr. Eumphreys.-Did he leave you then ? Witness.-Yes, he did. Mr. Humphreys.-Did you see him afterwards? Witness.-Not tiu the 18th, after I had seen Sir P. Carden. Mr. Humphreys.-I am not at liberty to ask you what Sir R. Carden said; probably Mr. Lewis will do so when he has to cross-examine you. I mention this because I do not want to keep it back. is inot strictly evidence for me. Witness.-I shall be very happy to answer any questions you may think proper to put to me. Mr. uamphreys.-Dld you see the defendant after the 18th . Witness.-I saw him on the 18th. Mr. Humphreys.-What conversation had you with him then ? Witness.-That I had nothing to do with it beyond send. ing him to Mr. Deputy KebbeL. Mr. Under-Sheriff Parker was with me then, and I had nothing to do with it but to send the defendant to Mr. Deputy KebbeL Mr. Humphreys.-Which you did ? Witness.-Which I did. Mr. Humphreys,-Did you see him afterwards on business? Witness.-Yes. I think he did caU upon me, but I had no communication with him-nothing of any .uoment at all. Then on the 18th Sir R. Carden called upon me. ha. Humphreys.-I am not at liberty to inquire into that. Mr. Lewis can do so. Witness.-It is so intimately connected with the proper understanding of the case that Sir R. Carden would not wi3h me for a moment to conceal it. Mr. Humphreys.-Sir Robert has nothing to do with that. Mr. wis can ask you about it. Witness.-I am only anxious that my position should not be damaged by the matter standing over tiUl to-morrow without explanation. Mr. Humphreys.-If Mr. Lewis were here he would object to my asking you the question. He is not here, and therefore I do not ask you. Witness.-The Lord Mayor will, I am sure, excuse my anxuety. I am only anxious that my oharacter shouldstand fair with the public. Mr. Humphreys.-I was most anxious to consider your position in this matter. Sir Robert Walter Carden sworn and examined as follows:- Mr. Humphreys.-You, Sir Robert, are an alderman of this city? Sir R. W. Carden.-I am. Mr. Humphreys.-The election for Lord Mayor was to take place on the 29th of September last ? Sir R. W, Carden.-It was. Mr. Humphreys.-Now, in consequence of what you had heard from anybody, or from any other reason whatever, did you in any way directly or indirectly authorize the employment of the defendant or any money to be given to him? Sir R. W. Carden.-Never ; I never even thought of it. Mr. EHumphreys.-Did you authorize his being employed in any way with regard to yourself or your election? Sir . W. Carden.-Never. May I stato the communication ? Mr. Humphreys.-It is not competent for me to ask you any other question in chief than I have asked you. It will be quite competent for Mr. Lewis to cross-examine you at very great length, and I have no doubt he will do so when he comes here to-morrow, but at present I have no other question to ask you. Sir I. W. Carden.-May I say two words ? M1r. Goodman.-You had better not, Sir Robert. The defendant's solicitor having gone it is desirable that the client should not be prejudiced.

COURT OP BANKRUPTCY, BE-ingth<a*cd, Oct. 2. TN RV f. .T %MA Tl (BeforJ Mr. Commiarm TT.V I The bankrupt ws a ghipbuilder, of BlackwalL Tbis was a meeting to consider a proposal to pay 4s. in the pound, and supersede the bakruptcy. Mr. Linklater appeared for the bankrUpt; Mr. LAwrance for the assignees Mr. IHollams for Messrs. Qulter and Ball; and Mr. Waller and Mr. Ditchburnforcreditors. Mr. Iai'L'TKR said the present meeting had been ap. pointed in his Honom's absence; it had, however, been Advertised, and he presumed was a regular meeting. The consent of nine-tenths of the creditors had been obtained. The Commssrosm said that, having regard to the order made by Mr. Commissioner Goulbmun the bankrupt ought to have obtained the sanction of the Court before this meeting was held. The Act of Parliament specially mentioned that the sanction of the Court should be obtained. Mr. LINU;Tz= said, this being the opinion of the Court, he would be willing to treat the present meeting as a nullity and ask for another. M.r. WALLna sdd this was the fourth or fifth meeting which had been held. The bankrupt came up In November for his oertificate and withdrew his application. No aooner had his Honour (Holroyd) left for his vacation than an application was made to Mr. Commissioner Goulburn. The creditors were dwindling down in consequence of these harassing proceedings. Jie now wished to record his client's dissent. It had never been contemplated by the Legislature that a bankrapt should walk out of court by means of a settlement of thiskJdnd. The Comssssioum sadd he had power to protecl the creditors from injustice by Awarding costs, and after some further discussion observed that it would be of advantage to the bankrupt before he had another meeting if he would study a rocent decision of tho Court of Exchequer. It pointed out cases 'where arrangements with creditors would not be valid. Mr. WAUtam submitted that A bankrupt could not see his creditors by sections and compound with them. His Hoooun said he understood it to be alleged that in this case debts had been sold for more than the amount of composition offered. If persons did buy in debts under such circamstances they would find great dificulties in carryig out the arrangement. 3rwsA_,zs-9e statute provides for that. If a creditor aocept a higher gratuity than the oomposition he forfeits the debt. Mr. WALLER observed that he should be able to show that Mr. Hollams's clients were not entitled to one shilling. Debts were sold at 7s. 6d. when an arrangement of 4s. was being offered. Mr. HOLLAxs sadd at the proper time be 'would answer the case. The sale 'was bond fle, and irrespective of this arrangement-even before it was contemplated. Eis clients had speculated on the sale of the property. Mr. GBEXN.-I am a lage creditor. The estate should have pad 12g. or His. in the ponnd, but it has been rascally handied; it has been plandered. The meeting then separated without another day being appointed to consider the propoeal.
POLICE. MARLDBOROGH-STRNT..-Wilikii. Rawlings, a cabdriver, vas charged with stealing a dismond bracelet, fr. Lewiis, of E plaoe, was or the complainant. Miss Flizabeth PoUock, 20, Uppr Glocester-place, Dorsetsquare, said,-About 3 o'clock, that morning, while in the act of crorslng the Haymarket, intending to engage a cab khe stumbled m a part of the road undergoing repair, ana feUclosetothecab-rank She got up quickly and had not proceeded more than hAlf-a-ozen steps before she missed her diamond bracelet, which she had seen safe on her arm jus* before her falL She instantly turned back, and seeing the prisoner talkin to two women she went up to them and inquired for her gracelet. One of the women pointed out the prisoner as the person who had picked it up. The prisoner denied that he had done so. The women both told her they had seen the bracelet in his hand. She begged the prisoner to restore the bracelet, and offered him 51. The prisoner denied having the bracelet, and she gave him into custody. The bracelet was worth 65 guineas. Isabela Beresford, Granby-street, was in the Haymarket at the time the complainant fell. As soon as complainant rose witness saw something glittering very much on the ground; prisoner was close by, and she distinctly saw him pick up the article that glittered. She saw the article sparkling in his hand; the prlsoner then walked to the cabrank and was immediately foUowed by complainant, who charged him with having picked up her bracelet. The prisoner laughed and said he had not got it. Witness told the prisoner she had seen him pick it up, and that sbe had noticed it in his hand. Heard the complainant offer 51. for the restoration of the bracelet. The prizoner said his pipe burnt a hole In his pocket, which let out his key and badge, which glittered as he picked them up. The witness was positive that the article picked up was neithor key nor badge. Mr. BRINGsoA decided on remanding the prisoner for a week. SOUTHwAmL-Thomas Blake and George Pavey, two notorious thieves, were charged with stealing a pocketbook, containing several valuable memarondums, from the person of Mr. Robcrt M'Kowl, in the Beckford-head Tavern, Eentstreet, Southwark. The prosecutor, a gentleman residing in the Kent-road, stated that on the previous evening he called in the Beckford-head Tavern for the purpose of transacting some business with the landlord. While talking to Mr. 'Utley over the bar he felt some one at his coat pocket, and on putting his hand down he missed his pocketbook. The prisonera were behind him, and as Pavey was attempting to leave the house he was stopped, and the pocketbook found on him. Both prisoners then made a desperate resistance, but they were overpowered and given into custody. MIr. Utley, the landlord of the tavern, said, that as aoon as last witness told him he had been robbed of his pocketbook he jumped over the bar, and suspecting Pavey had stolen it he seized hold of him as he was making his way out of the house. Blake, who was behind him, told his companion to say that he picked the pocketbook up, and then witness found the latter under Pavey's coat. Lie seized hold of him, while Mr. M'Kowl detained Blake, and after considerable resistance they were handed over to the custody of a constable. In defence Pavey said, that he picked up the pocketbook and intended to have given it up to Mr. Utley when he was seizedL Blake said he knew nothing of it. The MAGISTRATE asked what was known of the prisoners? Charles Rogers, 351 P, said that they were both notorious thieves. The prisoner Blake had been convicted no less than 18 times for felony. He was last tried and convicted at the Surrey Sessions in September, 1856, when he was sentenced to six months. Pavey had also been tried and convicted under the new Act. or. Itley also informed his worship that he knew them to be thieves, and he forbade them his house. Had he known they were in on the previous evening he should have turned them out. The MAGISTRATE said, it was quite time such characters were taken care of by the Government, therefore he should commit them to the sessions for trial.

The amount already subscribed-which I gratefullyacknowledge in another column of this paper-has chcsred the heart of many a poor soldier's v. ife and child. Would that every contributor could have heard the hearty blessIngs heaped upon their heads when I told them Ih aa few kind friends had forwarded some money for their relief. On Wednesday next there will be collections in most of our churches and chapels. Does not this pre:ent a fitting opportunity for the formation of a Generai Furd ? If the clergy would allow a moiety of thesc colections to go towards this laudable object, a sufficient sum would be raised to meet aU the more urgent cases at present arising out of the war, and would be offering a tangible expression of sympathy towards those brave fellows who have gone forit to deliver our countrymen and to re-establish Britisb rule in the East. Thanking you, Sir, for the valuable aid you have so kindly rendered, I have the honour to be Yours v,,rv rhdn I)ANfL, C()OKU. LnCUM ten; ot kBrompton, Ohatharii. Oct. 2.
A M,LN STABBED BY IlS WVIFE.-The inhabitants of Shepton Mallett were on Friday afternoon thrown into a state of excitement in consequence of a report that a woman named Eiiza Sneiliog, livinig in Coombe-lane, had nearlymurdered her husband, by stabbing himi in the herd with a knife. On tho man's returning home to dinner a quarrel took place between him and his ife, which was unfortunately terminated by her seizing a table knife and stabbing lim in the face. In the eotrse of the afternoon the woman was brought before Mr. E. H, Dickinson, at the magistrates' office, but as it was merely intended to have her remanded, the only evidence taken was that of Police-Sergeant Jeffs of the county constabulary, who deposed as follows :-I received intormation shortly after 1 o'clock to-day that a man had been stabbed by his wife in Coombe-lane. I prooeeded to the house in wLich the prisoner, Eliza Snehling, lives, and there saw a large quantity of blcod in the doorway, in a pan, and in A bucket. The prisoner was in a ?ower room. ,he said, 'I'm not goLng to run away." I went upstairs and saw her husband, John Snelling, lying in bed. I saw that he had a very long cut, strapped up, on the right si(l of his face. It extended from the temple to the chin. Before I spohe to him he moved his lips as I put down my ear to him. lIe said, very faintly, "T Take .my wife into custody for attempt. ing to murdor me.' That was all he said, and, as he appeared so very exhausted, I did not ask him many questions, I then came down stairs and took the prisoner into custody. 4Dn,proceeding to the house a second time I received the kMAe, a small table one, from the prisoner's daughter. On showing it to the prisoner she said, "That is the knife I did it with; I sharpened it to clean a sheep's head." I eoosidez tho man Is in a very dangerous state. On being asked If shin kad anything to say, she stated that both she and her husband were in fault, and if she had not stood in her own defense she might have been murdered herself. The Prisoner was then reniiqndea till Friday nuetk-,Str6ornJ daurnal.
THE MURDER AT PM1fA.fAr. The inquest on James Henderson, far, of Bramall who was shot while in bed on Wednay morning, was opened on Thursday evening by Mr. Johnson, coroner, Stockport. Mr. W. P. Roberts, attorney, attended to watch the case for the prisoner, James Henderson, jun. I Jane Hendersox said,-l am da&ughter of the deceased, and resided with my father at Hardy's farm. He was 60 years of age. Two sons and two-daughters, including myself, lived at home. There were also three men-servants, a boy, and a woman. All slept in the house, except two of the men, who slept in the granary. My father sleDt alone for the last 14 months, in one of the front bedrooms. My brother James slept alone in the other front bedroom, and he had done so orc a few months. I Blept in one of the back bedrooms on the same floor, to the left of my father's, and next to that of my brother James. My mother and a married sister (grs. Earlam) slept in arother back bedroom on the same floor, to the right of my father's. My brother Thomas slept in one of the attics, where there were two beds. The granary adjoined the house, but there was no internal commrunication with it. I and my mother went to bed about 12 o'clock on Tuesday night, and at that time alU the other inmates of the house had retired except my brother James. I went to bed as soon as I got into my room, and fell asleep in about ten minutes. I did not hear my brother James go to bed. When I went up stairs I saw the kitchen door (the one entering from the north) locked and barred. I did not look at the front (the southern or main) door. Miy mother generally looked to the doors. The front door was usually opened every day, but I cannot say whether it was opened on Tuesday. Miy brother James frequently stopped up after the others, reading and writing; and when I went to bed on Tuesday night he was writing in the sitting-room. By father went to bed between ' andi 10 o'clock on Tuesday night. I was awoke about 2 o'clock on Wednesday morning, and the first tbing I heard was the noise of footsteps on the stairs. I heard several footsteps, and immediately afterwards I heard my brother James open his door and fire. I am quite sure that I heard him open his door. I only heard one report. I did not go out of my room; but shortlv afterwards my brothers and the two servants who were sleeping in the granary, and the one who sOept with my brother Thomas in the attic, entered my room and told me tha' my father had been shot. I cannot say how long it was after I heard the report that they caule to me, but it was shortly afterwards. I got up immediately and went into my father's room. I found bim lying on his back with his head on his pillow and his arms outside the clotbes. He was in the same position that be usually slept in. He was severely wounded1 in the face. When I went into his room my mother and two brothers and the men servants were there, and my mairied sister followed me. My brother Thomas had on his tromers, but nothiug else, and my brother James was in his night shirt. Tke house was examined by the men, and by brother Thomas told me that the kitchen door was found open. They found no trace of any robbers. The dining-room door, which was not locked at night, was open, and my brother James's desk had been broken open, and 141. lOs. taken from it. I never sawv the money in the desk, but my brother James told me that it had been left in it the night before. A drawer beloaging to the cupboard in the kitchen was also opened, but nothing was miss:d from it. A " collie" dog was kept in the house, and my brother Thomas told me that on Tuesday night it slept in his bedroom. Sometimes it slept in Thomas's bedroom, and sometimes in James's. It does not make any .lai.ns at strangers except when out of doors. Jean lenderson.-I am the widow of the deceased. I went to bed about 12 o'clock on Taesday night. My daughter Jane went upstairs with me, but I slept with my married daughter Jessy, who had gone to bed before me. The deceased went to bed about o'clock, I left my son James in the sitting-room. I fastened the outside kitchen dcor before I went to bed, and I 1 new thaJ the front one was nlso fastened. I feol asleep shortly after I went to bed, and I afterwards ass oke when I heard my son James coming upstairs, but I cannot s.y how long it was after I left him downstairs. I fell asleep again shortly after he went into his room, and I did naot wake till I heard the report of a gun, about 2 o'clock in the morning. The next thing I heard was James opening his door and firing a gun down the stairs. There was not more than half a minute between the first and second shots. I next heard sounds as of persons running down the staisa, either in their stockings or with somethirg over their sboes. Directly afterwards I heard James allig to his brolber Thonras in the attic to come down stairs immedia-ell, as there were robbers in the house. I and my daughter got out of bed and held the door, fearirg that the robbers might come into our room. Afterwards my two Eons cawe into my room; Thomas had on only his trousers, and Janice was in his night-shirt. After they went downstairs they fired two other shots from the kitchen door, in order to frighten the robbers. Mr. Roberts, for the prisoner, here applie I to have the inquiry adjourned, on thegroundthathe was not suffic;ently inst ucted to cross-examine the witnesses. He aiso applied that at the next sitting the prisoner should be present. Thn Coroner said that he intended to take the evidence of aLl the inmates of the house to-night. As yet nothing bid been stated tending directly to implicat3 the prisoner, and as soon as anything was given that ah^eted him he would adjourn the inquiry. He was always arxious that a pe'son who was charged with a criminal offence should be present when 'ne evldence was given against him, but he did not see that he could order the accused to be broaght befoia the jury. Mr. Reddish (clerk to the magistrates for the Stockport division) said he thought there would be no objection on the part of the magistrates to allow the prisoner to be present at the inquiry when anything was proved that affected him; but at present there was notbing that impricated him, ard he could not sce how the inquiry could be adjourned at this stage. Mrs. HenderEon, in reply to Mr. Roberts, stated that her son was now in custody on the charge of murdering his father; but he was a good and kind son both to lher husband and to herself. Mr. Roberts then renewed his application for an adjournlent, bhut the coroner decided upon t-king further evidence. Thonias Henderson.-r am son of the deceased. I went to bed in the attic on Tuesday about halb-past 11 o'clock. I was disturbed by the report of fire-arms about 2 o'clock on the folowing morning, and I imnnediately jumped ou' of bed and awoke the servant-man and the boy. I heard my brother get out of bed ard walk as if to get his gaun and then fire. As soon as I could get a light 1 and the man went balf-way down the stairs leading to my father's room. I heard the second shot in about half a minute after the first, and then my brother James caUed out that there we.e robbers in tire house. I am not sure whether he caUed befor3 or after the second shot. I cannot reco!!ect. While I was standing on the landing, half-wa-v down the gerret stairs, James went back into his room and re-loaded the gun. It was a double-barreDled gun ; but one of the barrels had been discharged the moining before, when my brother shot at a sarrow in the pear tree by the side of the house. I know t at he shot at a sparrow because I saw him do it. I distirctly heard him ramming both barrels whUe I was on the stairs- and as soon as he came out of his room he and I and a man went down stairs. I went first, carrying a candle and a slick. The outer kitchen door was standing open. It was fastened the night before with a lock aud a wooden bar. The bar was resting against the wall, and not broken, so that it must have been placed there. The lock was not iniured, and the key was in it on the inside. We did not look at the windows until we had knocked up the two Irishmen who slept in the granary. None of the vAndows had been broken or interfered with. 1 looked into the lobby, and saw that the front door was fastened. In the sitting-room we found that my brother J-ames's desk had been broken open and 141. lOs. belonging to him taken f-om it. I never saw the money, but he told me that he had left it there. We next went upstairs into our father's room, into which we had not gone before. We foiuid him lying on his back, with his head upon the piUovw, and his a^rms folded across his chest, as if he had been asleep when he was shot. After his evidence had been read over, and before he signed it, the witness stated that after his brother fired he heard footsteps on the stairs, and they aDpeared to be those of three or four persons, who had something on their shoes. After he and his brotherhad been into bis father's room, his brother gave him the gun, and he went and dischar, ed both the barrels at the back door. Previously to this he had beea to his mother's and sister's rooms and told them that his father was dead. AU this occupied about a quarter of an hour. The powder and shot were sometimes kept in the sitting-r-oom and sometimes in James's bedroom. He recollected hearing his sister Jane say that his brother James had fired one of the barrels of the gun at a sparrow, and killed it on T'aesday morning, and he (T[bomas) afterwards saw the dead bird in the kit^zhen. Jessy Earlam.-I am the wife of Edvward Earlam, a farmer of Woodford, end daughter of the deceased, at whose house at Bremul I lived. I slept with my motber, and on Taesday rlght I retired to rest between f and 9 o'clock. I was ascep when my mother came to bed. I was awoke about 2 o'clock the next morning by the report of firearms. Immediately afterwards my brother James onened nis door and shouted, but 1 am not ovt e whether he fired I think he did. Between the lirst and second reports I heard footsteps in my father's room, and they sounded as if thepe! sons had something on their shoes. After the second shot I heard footsteps going down the stairs. This was the Last witness exaamined, and the coroner ad. joi rned the inquiry to Tuesday next.
SUICIDE.-Yesterday an act of suicide was comnmitted by Mr. Edmund Taylor, a gentleman 60 years of age, at Poole's London-bridge Hotel. The deceased gentleman, who was well known in the city, had for some years past been in the employment of Messrs, Lennox and Co., merchants, of Broad-street. About balf-past 11 o'clock yesterday morning he went to the above hotel, where he was well.known, and proceeded to the coffee-room, there being no person besides himself there at the time. He sat down and vommrenced writing, and was thus leftalone. Atabout a qiarter to 1 o'clock the waiter went into the room for the purpose of cleanin the glass in the door when he saiw the deceased apparently resting his head betwe'en two tables, and there was an unusual smell in the root. He went np to him, and then saw a wouwd underhis leftear, fromn whioi the blood had Slowed copiously. A enknife, marked with blood, was lying neat his npo atae. The waiter gave an alarm, ad r.Croft, surgeon, was sent for, and promptly attended. On his arrival, hc said that deceaeed was ded and had been so for some time. A letter rnitten by the decease& was found upon the table, directed to Mr. Middleton, surgeon, of Bow-lane, referring to the fact that he intended to eomen,nit suicide, and wishing that his body mnight be sent to a hosphl'al for dissection, for the purpose of ascer tamintg what was t,se matter with him, as he had suffered from somne internal cu,mPlai.nt. Mr. W. Payne has received notice of the event, Asnd will hold an inquest on the body..
RAILWAY INTElLIENCE. RAILWAY ERCIIFTPR The traffic returns of railways in the united klngdom publtshed for the week ending September 26 amounted to 513,5071,, and for the corresponding week of 1856 to 488,2431., showing an inerease of 25,264l. The gross receipts of the eight railways having their ternmini in the metropolis amounted for the week ending as above to 214,5691., and for the corresponding week of last year to 210,1101., showing an increase of 4,4591. The increase on the Eastern Counties Railway amounted to 2,2214; on the Great Northern to 2,4131.; on the Great WVestern to 1,1431.; on the London and North-NVestern to 2,0491,; and on the London and Blackwall to 681.; total 7,8931. But from this must be deducted 7434, the decrease on the London, Brighton, and South Coast; 3261. on the London and South-Western; and 2,3661. on the SouthEastern, together 3,4341.; leaving the increase as above 4,4591. The receipts on the other lines in the united kingdom amounted to 298,9384, and for the corresponding period of 1856 to 278,1331., showing an increase of 20,80514 in the receipts of those lines, whioh, added to the increase on the metropolitan lines, makes the total increase 25,2641. as compared with the corresponding week of 186. The following are the receipts of railways for the past week :_ GRBAT WESTERN OF CANADA. The repol t of the direct rs of this compary states that the total capi,al they are authorized to raise is 4,450,000L The amount s'ill oupaid is 101. sterliug, or 121. 3s. curr3ncy, per share on the new shares, amounting, less what has been paid In advance, to 925,8561 The total >-nount received on capit7l arcount to the 31st of July last was 5,250,4351., and the total expenditure 5,267,91 1., includiug 317,2o71. on the Sirnfi' branch (50 miles) now under constl dc ion, and 91,4981. on the Guelph branch, 17 miles in length. The total capital outlay during t. e half-year on the 283 miles in operation amointed to V7,538. This sum has been expendea in completing unfSiished portions of the ine, rolling stock, buildings, and sidings. The net revenue fromn the working of the traffic during the half-year, after deducting iuterest on bonds and loans and adding surplus from last ha1f-year, amounts to 94,136., out of which the directors recommend a dividend a. the rate of 6 per cent, on the share capital. This sill absorb 93,7131., and leave 4231. for the sining fund,vwhich now amounts to 68,2791. The gross revenue for the ha]f-year amounted to 324,156&, and for the corresponding period of last year to 355,751/., showing a decrease of 31,5051. The gross traffic for the year ending the 31st of July last amounted to 718,0371., and for the year ending the 31st of July 185G to 687,5121., showing an increase of .'0,52J1. Deducting the expendiLre on account of renewals of permanent way, the comparLson between the ordiuary working expenses for the four lasb half-years were as follows :-For the half-year ending the 31st of January, 1856, i63,3'J41, or s. 3Ad. per train mile; ending the 3Lst of July, 1856, 192,5711., or 6s. 41d. per traiu n'le; ending tbe 3,lt of January, 1857, 18:5,611., or 6s. per train mile and ending the 31st of July, 1857, 173,6281., or 5s. OJld. per brain mie. The per cent. of working expenEes onthereceipts was 49 , 64, 47,eand5S3? respectively. Thereceiptson the main line have been 491. 5s. 6d. per mile per weeL- * on the Toronto branch, 271. 17s. 6d.; and on the Gilt branch, i01. &S. 7d. per mile per week. The actual working expenses have amounted to 173,6281., as against 192,5711. during the corresponding half-year. The cost par train per mile is 61d. less. The cost of malutanarce of the permanent way has been reduced by 1,1851. dur!ug the last six months, or equal to a reduction of 91. 18s. a mile. The line and works are now in an excellent state of repair, and consequently there is every reason to iiope for a stiU urther reduction in the charge for maintenance. The extent of renewals of rails will, however, be inereased, The locomotive expenses ale at the rate of 20-175d. ner mile. The sup3rinbendent of this department repox ts that the stock is now in an efficient condition, the extens-ive damages caused during the severe winter having been thoroughly repaired. Considerable economy has been etrected in the working of the enfines, but the repairs have been very heavy and numerous. It is hoped that this expevse will be less during the current six months. The past winter was one of most unusual severity, causing great damage both to the rolling stock and roadw?y, and as a necessary consequence renderIng the expanse of working very high in every department. Tl-e entire stock is in a veiy satisfactory condition, The airangements at the western terminus Lave now been perfected by tiee laing of a telegraphic cable under the Detroit River, thus affording a complete comwitnica. tion through Canada between the Atlantic and the extreme west. This is found to be of great convenience, and ensures regularity in the working of the traffic. The hopes which fie directors entertained that it would be possible to reduce the expense of advertising and agency in the United States have not been realized. They rejloce to see the movement which has been set on foot by the two New York lines to prevent the recurrence of such ruinous coimpetition, and the earnest efforts of this company will be used to assist in bringing it into permanent effect. There has been expended duting the last half-year 87,5881. on account o' the completion of the works and rolling stock on the opened lines. This formis part of the suni of 424,1491. voted iby the shareholders on the 11th of Se3p ember, 18n6, to eomplete theline. Of thatamount 143, 3831. stUll remains unexpended, and this, there is every reason to anticipate, will be sufficient to close the capital account until such time as the extentof traffic demands the providing of increased facllities ior its accommodation. e expenditureon the Sarnia brasch is317,2871. up to the 31st of July, 1857. The road bed, bridging, station buildings, )&c., are nearly completed, and will be finished by the end of the present year. The rails provided by the contractor for that line have reached Canada - but part of these, owing to the failure of some of the iron on the opened lines, mentioned in the last report, are being used for relaying the mainline as required, and the quantity so made use of will be replaced by new iron to be shipped from England next year. This arrangement will defer the opening of the Sarnia line until next year, when, in eddition to the local traffic, it is hoped that the traffic from the Port Hluron and Milwaukee line wil also come upon the ';arnia branch. There has now been expended, under the arrangements already reported, a sum of 91,4981. for the completion of the line from Galt to Guelph. For this outlay this company receives frst mortgage 6 per cent. bonds of the Galt and Guelph Company. The line is very nArly finished, and when opened is expected to be of considerable boneBt bs1 tb the Gait hranoh and thi main line, .n indepeb d;i company has constructed a line of 10 miles, from Preston to Berlin, involving no expenditure on the zart of this omrpany. Arrangements have been conclude I oywhich theGreat ester Company will work that line, expected to be opened before the winter, and the traffic denved from it will still further increase this company's receipts. The Detroit and Milwaukee Railway is now open to Ionia, 127 mUes from Detroit, and only 35 maies from Grand Rapids, to which city the trains will be running during the month of October next. By the spring of next year the line wil be completed to Lake Mlihigan, and then a direct communication wil be opened with Milwaukee and the States of Wisconsin and Minnesota, affording to that vast territory a saving of upwards of 100 miles in the distance to the seaboard, to be still further reduced by 50 mUes on the completion of the Port Huron and Sarnia branches. The accession of traffic to this company from the opening of the entire length of the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway must be very considerable. The directors have no doubt that the proprietors fully appreciate the importance to the Grea" Western Railway of the speedy opening of the Detroit and Milwaukee line, and they trust that the arrangements now pending will secure the money necessary to complete and stock that line without delay, so that the benefit to the revenue of this company may be felt at the earlieit moment. Acting upon the urgent representations of many influential shareholders, the board has completed arrangements for securing entire control over the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway Company in all its operations, thus affording perfect security for any assistance which the shareholders may think It desirable to afford that company with a view of completing it throughout without delay. The Canadian Government have agreed to accept the repayment of the loan or advance of 700,0001. in four equal instalments on the 1st of July, 1858, 1st of January aud 1st of July, 1859, and 1st of January, 1860. The sum standing to the credit of the sinking fund, amounting to 167,861., has now been trasuferred to revenue account. The report, at some length, accounts for the fallng off in the traffic during the past half-year, and concludes by stating that the directors have every reason for believing that the profits of the company will increase during the carrent half. year, and that the future prosperity of the company will be greater than it has been in the past.
STATE 0F TRADE. MANCHESTER, OCT. 2, The market is quiet, and a moderate business only is doing. Yarns are about l8d to Id. per lb. lower than the recent high quotations, with the exception of doubled, which maintain full rates. Fi-se counts are neglected. The cloth-market is firm, with a demand for shirtings euited to China and of light shirtings for India, but domestics and printersare not in active request. Messrs. obert Freeland and Brother say in their monthly circular:- " Until within the last ten days the dematnd for both goods and Ius has been on a itberal scale, sufficlent to absorb the production of the mills and place spinners and manufacturers under contract for future delvery. There is still a considerable amount of buying for China, anda qulet, steady business for other markets; but, as compared with the first threeweeks of the montb, the excitement has subsided, end qujtations ace getting more regular, although there i3 no actul decline in price.

ZNDIAN RAIL IVA YS. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In the letter of "Indophilus," published in Tic T limss of last Tuesday, I observe it laid down that the facUity obtainable through the development of the raUroad system gin Indiaof speedily concentrating a superior force on any given Point not only would enable a sman force to do the work of a large one, but would give to a small one a prompt and decisive efficacy which a large one without this assistance would not have. "IndophilUs" states it as his opinion that railways are better than regiments. I take the liberty of controveiting the principle thus laid down, more particularly as applicable to the present state of India, Railways may be rendered powerful auxiliaries In war, but they can only be useful as internal means of communication, terminating in the presence of the enemy, and liable to be interrupted by every movement which gives him the most temporary control of the territory traversed by any portion of the line. Railways as military roads would have been useless in the present matiny in every district where the Government has lost the military control, and next to useless in aU districts in the slightest degree disaffected. War, if we exclude naval warfare, is a condition of things which approaches nearest to a state of barbarism, and admits least of the application of the modern discoveries in science and the arts. The best troops are those which handle best the weapons of personal conbat, the sword and the bayonet. The only reliable means of locomotion are the foot of man and horse. Navigable rivers, where they exist, are reliable as routes of communieation to a civllized Power. Large rivers, to a rower having a flotilla adapted to the stream, may become important bases of operations. But rivers are one of the great natural features of a country, unchangeable by the hand of man; not so raUways, which an enemy, by an incursion of a few hours' duration, or a traitor within the territory, may cut up and utterly destroy. As military routes they are much less reliable than common roads. In making these remarks I do not mean to undervalue railways as military roads. I only mean to controvert the principle too prominently laid down by "IndophUus," that by maldng raUways the Government of India, or of any o'her country, can afford to reduce its mliltary establishment. A general in possession of the internal lines of com. munication may accompUsh more with fewer troops by means of a network of raUways enabling him to concentrate his battalions with greater rapidity upon the deciVve point for the time. Every one must agree in this propo. sition. The same result attended the possession of the internal lines of communication before railways were in existence. But the Inhabitants of the country must be with the general to a man, or he must place a guard over every furlong of the route, which is impossible. Railways are thus relable only in a patriotic defensive war, or in such a campaign as that in the Crimea, where the allied force was based eupon the sea, and had an immoveable operative front, with entire possession of the intermnediate country. England ought by all means to construct railways in India, both as military roads and to open up the commercial resources of the coantry; but wbere her territory is so vast, and where war has to he waged so often beyond her own territory, and where internal enemies have also to be guarded against, a sufficient military force must always be mainitained, trusting solely to the natural modes of locomotion, and containing withl itself every requisite for service in the field and for maintaining its own communications with the seat of government. Railways, though of vast importance, can never supply the place of regiments. T . - C_ SCOTUS. Sept. 30.
TuII MAiLs, &C.-SOUTHAMPTOr , Oct. 2.-The Royal Mail Company's steamship Atrato, Captain Woolley, left to-day with the Wese India, Mexican, and Pacific maUs, 21J passengers, 4,0001. in specie, jewelry value 19,0001., and a full cargo.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-There is so large a show of reasoning and apparent Torbearance, yet firm opposition, in "P.'s" letter in your paper of the eOth ult., to those who desire that our Government in India should declare its Christian character, that I cannot but point ont that his letter is reaUy one entirely of attack, while the line of policy he pursues is undefined. His comments on the Act of the Legislative Council as to inheritance are exceUent, and if the law in them is correcta qualificstion I insert simply because I am ignorant myself as s, what the law is, and who it is who here sets it forthit is at once a specimen of apparent fair, but in truth onesided legislation. I think the climax of the legacy to the preceptor is a colouring that had better been omitted. But this attacks not the bearing openly by the Goveinment of a Christian charaoter, but a faulty Act, as I opine, springing from the Government while hampered by and acting under a donble policy. Acting in a feeble manner as regards most matters they strike a heavy, ill-judged one entirely inconsistent with their general attitude. if I may venture to state what I believe to be the views of those who desire the Government to assume a Christian charaoWer, they aLre thus:- We have conquered this land, we have spread and are spreading civilization, aotivity, and commerce, and we are gving a just rule and justjudgmentwherc nothing but raids, and oppression, and foulest crime clouded the land aud made it hatefuL Yoa natives have your religion, we believe it to be the source of much of the evil that is past, of much that opposes the diffusion of light and peace. Yet we wiU not touch it further than this. In the first place, if we take your people into our pay as soldiers, or In any other capacity, they must enter that service with the clear anderstanding that Islamism or Brahninism in no way interferes with our service; you shall not be compelled to eat beef or pork, you may serve those gods you have set up, bat with this limitation, yoa must do the work of soldiers or o2 your other employment, and at the times when soldiers or others in the like capacity with yourselves do it. This is no hardship; if you do not like the f3rms do not come. As to matters of civil government, you all alike are our subjects, If a man of you turns Christian YOU shall not assault him, you shall aot strip him of wife and fami.y our law shall support and uphold him as it would any of you, Where we see murder and foul incest and crime In connexion with your religion, there we will touch your religion and forbid such things, for they are against any attempts at righteous government. And now for the schools. Is not Lord Shaftesbury right? Who are compeUed to come to the schools ? None. Dut the Hindoo may say, " NVe are your subjects; ont of the revenue you foundsa school; we wish to send our sons to it, but it teaches the destraction of our faith. Set up forus other schools where we may learn to read and write, to train our thoughts on the classics, and enlarge themn in the sciences-and where the Bible is not." Can the Hindoo fairly say this? If he can, then I say there is but one course for the Government-drop them entirely. Education ard civilization proceeding on other foundation than a Christian one must ever be au anomaly under a Christian Government, and ever be beheld with dissatisfaction by its Christian members-even those only professedly such, if they re-ard it carefully, and bearing on it no more than a head knowledge of Christian principles. Then, I say, let the missionary schools go to work, throwing open wider doors, setting in the chief plaes active, judicious, clever Christians, and pay them well. Let them proclaim, "We will teach all we cau; teach in classics, art and science ; and the foundation of all our teaching il, and must be, tbe Bible." I do not go into the question of whether they will have scholars; I believe they would very soon. India is altering. I think we may trace great emulation in the natives; I mean the better classe. Doe not let Government favour these any more than it would native schools set up by Mahomedan or Hindoo; but let each be equally protected, let it &ud its officers deal just judgment to each whe:e they come under its notice, and let neither have a privilege of any kind. I cannot think this view visionary, and we shall, God willig, before long have the opportunity and ample means toD assume this attitude. Let the Government cast off aU wavering policy, mending its own abuses as far as possible-and it has many to mend -compromising only where the compromise is a part of its plinciples, but never where it datr-f. frmn +1,nn YOUNG OIRUMAD.
