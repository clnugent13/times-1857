EDWARD JORDON, Masor, a.d Cautos Botuloram, in the ohair, The following resolutions were unanimously adoptedl- Moved by the Right Rev. the Bishop of Kingston, seconded by the Rev. Tnomass Sewart, D.D., Bishop's Commis&ary for middilelexresolved; Tbat a variety of concurrent evidence has demoustrated beyond all reasonable doubt that the Afr.cau slave trade in Cuba has acquired a powerful inppulse fiom the policy of the British Government adopted in relation to the sugar duties in 1846; and that during the lest and three precediog years this Illioit and inhumau traffic bas been prose. cuted with a vigour and open defiance of the treaty atlpulations concluded with GreAt Blrtain by Spain, which are at the Eame time repuil sive to humanity, fmultingto the B ritih authbority, and unjust towards the free iniiustry of the British West Indican Colonies, Moved by William Girod, BGr. seconded by P. A. Repent sq- That the reputed proceedings of tbe CrlminalTnibunalsof sieUtletd States prove irresistibly that the slave trade betweea thebWetern CORst of Africa and thso Iland of Cuba ia now, and bas been for some time, almost wholly carried on in Amerioan vessels, bearing the American f3g, owned by Amerin an titizens. and dtted out in American rorts lend that it is publicly notorious that this flag has been resorte3d to for the purpose of protecting the trafflo from molestation or searoh ou the part of Her Majesty's hips as well on the coast of Africa as on the high seas, Moved by M. N. Nathan, Req., seoonded by Alex. Aia, REsq.; That it is a fact too notorious to admit of question that this ecandalous traffic, cantled on in defiance of treaties, is conducted with the fal knowledge and unuder the collusve sanction of the Spanish authore. ties in Cuba. who participate in ita gates. Moved by the Rev. Johr. Radliffe, seconded by the Rev. J. B Ward- That it these treaties are not to be regarded as a simple mockery of the humanity which Is supposed tohave dictated them, itis the opinion of this Meeting that it is the imperative duty of Her Majesty's Cover i- uient to adopt, witbout further delay, such coercive measures as are neseroary to enforce their exact aud faithful observance on the pact of Spain, Moved by W. W. Anderson, Eq., secondedby °enry J. Stevens, Esq.; That inasmueb as the trafflois publicly sheltered by a neutral flag which renciers futile the preventivemeasures aid to have been adopted oy the British Government for Its suppression, the only effective mode of dealng with the question appears to this Meeting to rest in a gene. ral blocade of the coast of Caba by a sufficient British naval force, or which, as this Meeting believes would be equalproductive of practical results, by an offioial announoement to the PSpaUih Government tbat such an ulterior measure would be resorted to unless the etipulatloen of the treaty were falthfully and bonestly com lied with. But this Meeting, iu the name of humanity, as well as in th name and on betalf of the emanclpated free men of these colonies, protests against theperformancesof thesestlpulations being permitted any loguer ti rest on the faithlesa promises of the Spanish Government, Moved by the Rev. J. Edmonston, seconded by the Rev. James Watson; That, apart wholly from the moral considerations which are bound uD in thisquestion, this Meeting feels caUed upon to assert solemnly and public the political obligations which the Bdtish Government must be considered to have contracted with the sugar coloniesof the Empire at the Deriod of West India slave emanclPaUton-obligatlons vwhih have been systematically violated by the tadt permissdon which has allowed Spain to outrage all her treaties for the suppression ofjthe slave trade, and by the openenoouragement that has been given to this public breach of faith by the pro-slave trade legilation of 1846. Moved by B. Hamilton, Req., M.D., seonded by JohnNethersole, That petitions he vresented to Dt lHouses of Parliament, based on the foregoingresolutions, praying the Legielature to adopt such immediate steps as may be necessary to lay before Her Most Gracious Mtajesty the hutmble pLraeroof Her Majesty's Lords and Commonsin Parliament assembled, tbat HerMajesty's Government may he directedto take immediate and efectivo measures to oompel the performance by Spain of her treaties with Great Britain, the violation of which is a publio scandal to humanity and a reproich to the national faith of Moved by the Hon. James Porteous, seconded by B. J. a ttoihtns, That a Committee bs a ppointed to collect and obtain a printed report of the pro ceedin of he Deset MeoEng for distribuUoma among the Members of both Houses of Parliment, and, as far amaybe practicable, among the British pple, and for the collection of sub. scrptions for such purpose, as well as for the purpose of advertising the resolutions adopted this dayin the columns of the Landen pressand that such Commi5ttseebhempoweredto appoint a Treasurer, as well as to nominate two gentlem en in Loodes to act on behalf of this Meoeting in selecting the Mlember or Parliament to present the peti- ED UCATIONAI OONFERENCE.- President- IL B,L H.

BX IIB;ITON OF ABT T?EASUIES AT MANC7BSTER. (Continued from l'he Tintes of KAy 1o.) The Venetian school is exemplified at Manchester in but one very conspicuous work earlier than Gian Bellini. This is the rarge Crivelli (A.D. 1476-1486) contributed by Lord WVard (191), by far the finest work of this painter in England, and one of the very finest anywhere. It is worth noticing how comipletely the quality of colour, destined to be L that by vwhich Venetian art was to impress itself upon the iorld, is here subordinated to a certain hard individuality in the saints who surround the Virgin, and in the combination of great feminine sweetness .and marked affectation in the Virgin herself. Still, there is an indication of elaborate and gorgeous colour in the profuse draperies. One of the pictures from the Soulages Collection (A.D. 1091), hung near the Crivelli, and ascribed to "Antonio Vivarini," is more like the work of Bartolommeo, the contemporary of Crivelli. These pictures should be compared with the one very impressive work of Ginu Bellini (A.D. 14261516) here exhibited, from the gallery of the Rev. W. Davenport, at Bromley. Gran Bellini was the real founder of that Venetian school of colourists which developed itself most consummately in Giorgione and Titian. But with the splendour of tint and tone was combined the influence of the hard, antique school of Padua, of which Andrea Mantegna is the leading master. He was brother-in-law of Gian Bellini, and this picture showvs how materially the Venetian painter was influenced by the Paduan School of Squarcione (A.D. 1394-1474). Compare this "Agony on the Mount of Olives,' by Gian Bellini with the same subject as embodied in Mantegna's impressive treatment of the same subject here exhibited (290), from the Fesch Galery, now the property of Mr. T. Baring. A casual observer would attribute the two pictures to the same hand. The Bellini has suffered fiom the cleaner, especially in the sky and the landscape; but what is left of the original work is enough to guide us to an appreciation of the solemnity of that dawn which reddens in the horizon and catches the edges of the cold blue sky-now green by change of colour. The impressiveness of the picture is due in great measure to its clearly conceived rocky landscape, in which we may see how incapable the ]5th century painter was of depicting true rocky structure. This is aU built up architecturally, as it were. But how intense is the expression of the Christ, absorbed in bitter supplication upon the rocky peak, and how perfectly is sleep expressed in the figures of the over-worn Apostles, laid here and. there, as weary men might have stretched themselves, with even less attention to grouping than in Mantegna's composition. The incident in both pictures is conceived in the same manner; only the troop of soldiers, led by Judas, in the distance of Bellini's work, is by Mantegna transformed into a whole troop defiling from the city-gates. The expression of wakeful agony in the Christ and deep sleep in the Apostles is equally perfect in both. There is a small portrait head ascribed to Bellini (193), from Mr. Holford's gallery, of little importance as compared 'with this picture of the scene on the Mount of Olives. Next to the Bellini in importance, as illustrating the Venetian school before Titian, are the works of his pupils, Vienzo Catena, representing the Virgin and child between a St. John and a St. Catherine, and the Amadei Conegliano, from Lord Northwich's gallery-a St. Catherine, full of dignity and grace, and having already lost al the hardness of the earlier master. It is a misfortune perhaps inseparable from the hanging of any great number of pictures in a limited space that we must pass from Saloon A to Saloon B before we can take up the succession of the schools of Venice in Giorgione, Titian, and his followers. It is to be hoped that the rearrangement of. numbers in the new catalogue may render it less difficult to refer to than at present. But, whatever may be done by rearrangement of the catalogue, there is a want of sequence in the hanging of the productions of schools which we fear it is now too late to remedy. This impairs the value of the Exhibition for purposes of instruction. But Mr. Scharf has probably had difficulties known only to himself, owing to irregular arrivals and other causes, which would account, we have no doubt, for even more serious mal-arrangement than we' have to complain of. Venetian art reached its prime of power in the hands of the great masters of decoration and portraiture of the sixteenth century, whose works next claim our attention. Though religious subjects were still treated by them, we find in their work no deep religious sentiment. The beauty of the Virgin, the grand harmonious eolouring of the groups of which she forms the central figure, and the consummate chromatic arrangement of the whole composition, are now paramount. If the committee had had it in their power to compel the presence here of the noblest Venetian works in this country, this department of the Exhibition would doubtless have presented a magnificent illustration of consummate colour. But this was not in their power. The strict conditions of family settlement in most cases, and in others, though less frequent, a not unnatural reluctance to trust works of great value in strange hands, are sufficient to account for the comparative imperfection of this section of the Italian series. Biut it is only such wealth as is here displayed that makes us fastidious. If we cannot conscientiously aggree with the owners of five out of the six works here attributed to Giorgione in ascribing their pictures to that great master, we may find compensation in the preseice of many fine and unquestionable examples of his greater follower, Titian. " The Judgment of Paris " (208), contributed by Lord Mlalmesbury; the ' Cesar receiving the head of Pompey " (205), from the collection of Lord Darnley; the " Woman of Samaria" (207), sent by Sir Humphrey de Trafford, all bear traces of a handinferior to Giorgione's, though trained in his sehool. They may be the work of Rocco Marcone, his pupil. The portrait of Claus Sturtz den Beeker (208), from Lord Yarborough's collection, bears marks rather of a Flemish than of a Venetian hand. The Flemings of the 16th century were close imitators of the Venetian colourists, and the commercial artistic intercourse of the two countries was quite close and constant enough to supply opportunities for reciprocal influence. The one work here attributed to Giorgione, which, to our apprehension, carries in it strong evidence of authenticity,is "The Music Party,' from the Thirlstainehouse collection. It represents a youngcman sitting under a tree, accompanying with the pizzicato of his violin the song of two ladies seated near him. The sky and background must once have been a piece of glorious colour-a stream, with the back door of houses opening upon it, overshadowed by trees. As it is, the carnations have flown from the flesh, the rose colour and bright green of the ladies' dresses has faded, or been cleaned into pallor, and the blues of the baekground have changed to green, the greens to brown. One must recreate the colour of the picture to realize what it might have been in its effect to the eye. But the sentiment has survived cleaning and restoration, and still constitutes it one of those perfect idyls of luxurious yet innocent idlesse of which the well- known picture in the Louvre remains the crowning example. Titian is more adequately represented. Here are no fewer than 27 pictures ascribed to his hand. Of these we may at once dismiss a considerable number as palpable copies-first and foremost the six portraits of the C (220 to 225), versions bv an inferior hand of apotoofth-Cs-ri of heads which formerly beloneged to Charles I., and of which some of the originals are now in the pos- session of Lady Marian Alford. With equal confidence we may set aside the portrait of " Verdizotte" (21.9) and the "Duke of Alva" (227). But, this done, there remain works enough to represent Titian here as he deserves to be represented. We have the sketch for the large picture in the Escurial known as "La Gloriadi Tiziano," painted by order of Charles V. for the convent of Yuste, to which he retired on his abdication. Whether it was this sketch or the large work which by his own request was held up to his dying eyes we know not. But there is nothing here which more powerfully proclaims the power of the painter in splendid fusion of colour and hardihood of form. Above is the central glory of Paradise, with the Father and the Son, invested with the globe and sceptre of sovereignty, to whom the Virgin meekly ascendin'g looks back, mediatingly, to earth, while lawgivers'and prophets are grouped below, and ushered by angels into the awful presence a king kneels reverently, his crown doffed and his sceptre laid by his side. Then-to pass from Heaven to earth-we have, from Buckingham Palace, the rich wooded landscape, with a drove of cattle, filing up the kl4low way in the foreground, and a Xy ;a wh sanbeams dart from behind intercepting cloud-one of those wholes of subdued, yet splendid impressiveness of which Titian caulght the secret in his mountain birthplace at Cadoro. Another sketch, even more remarkable for power, is the "Rape of Proserpine" (sent by the Speaker), where the four black horses of the infernal chariot paw the river into foam, and one of her attendant nymphs catches at the wheel, in vaia effort to stay the gloomy King, who is clasping Proserpine in his arms. " Titian's Daughter holding up a Casket" (232) was one of the glories of the Orleans (1Gaery, under the name of "La Casette de Titian," and is now the property of Earl de Grey. There is a better replico of this subject in the Berlin Museum, where the maiden lifts up a plateau of flowers, instead of the casket. Lord Darnley's large picture of the "1 Rape of Europa?' (271), broad and unfinished as it is, is perhaps the finest example of the painter here exhibited. It belongs to his later period, but glows with a flush of colour, and shows throughout a mastery of even the failing hand of this great master -which dirt cannot conceal, and which, fortunately, cleaning has not marred. It is worth the while of the painter to look into this picture, which is fortunately hung near the eye, that he may see by what light indications of the brush a desired effect may be conveyed when the painter is thoroughly possessed by his intention, and perfect Imaster of his mnateriaL Of the sacred subjects the best here is the "Marriage of St. Catherine" (241), from the collection of LucienBonaparte,reminding one of,though inferior to, the great composition of the same subject in Vienna. But it is in the two portraits of Ariosto (-p36) and Alessandro de Medici (247)the former contributed by Lord Darnley, the latter by Her Majesty, from Hampton-court. that we may best learn the magic of Titian's power, in giving individuality of character, with all the magic of broad and mellow colour. In such works is united, perhaps, the highest conceivable perfection of the conceptional and technical elements of the painter's art. Herein conismted, indeed, the crowning achievement of the Venetian school, when it rose above mere splendid decoration. To this or to portraiture living art was henceforth limited. The religious pictures of the Venetians are rather magnificent church decoration than helps to devotion. So we see it employed here by the followers of Titian the Pahnas, younger anld elder (214 and 270), ionifazio (250), and Schiovone (248). The altarpiece attributed to Moretto (253), another pupil of Titian's,whose works are comparatively rare in this country, has been ruined by neglect; but we may see what this great master was in ortraiture in his full length of an " Armourer at isAnvl"(255), contributed by Lord Elgin. This picture we commend to the special study of all modern portrait painters. The shrewd old man, with black skullcap and long grizzled beard, is caught, as he stood at his work, looking up in answer to some bystander's remark, the hand that holds the hammer resting on the anvil, in the other hand the pincers that grasp the lance head he is at work upon. In the background the forge, with its charcoal fire and the bellows, marked and stamped a blacksmith for all time to come, not ashamed of his work, nor yet glorying in it, but doing it manfully and simply. There is no finer portrait than this for simple, manly rendering, its original as he lived in the whole of this great gallery. Of Tintoretto-that most daring and unequal of all the Venetian painterstheExhibitioncontains some 12 pictures, but (f these only three or four can be called worthy examples. They include two landscapeswithsacred subjects, "The Temptation of Christ" (257), and "The Sacrifice of Isaac" (258), from Lord Carlisle's collection, a series of large mythological compositions formerly forming part of the collection of Charles I. and the " Orleans GaUlery" (260, 264, 265), and three portraits (263, 266, and 269), and the great historical picture of "Esther befoie Ahasuerus" (261), contributed by Eler Majesty. The landscapes are hung too high for appreciation, but in the " Temptation" we may see the dignity of the Saviour, and the characteristic conception of the tempting fiend, as a robed and crowzned King, who points to the kingdoms of the world below with outstretched sceptre. The Venetians had a saying that Tintoretto had three pencils-one of gold, one of silver, and one of brass. Here are productions of all three. Every one may have been used in turn in " the Nine Muses,' magnific;,ut, fully developed, undraped female figures, flung about in a sea of cloud. At first the colossal scale and the dash of execution rather repel than invite careful examination of the work. B3ut if we get over the first impulse we shall be repaid by discovering the beauty that is enshrined in their gigantic forms and faces, the grand sweeping line of the composition, and in the centre an altogether original conception of Apollo, the centre of the group. At first you think the Sungod absent, only represented by the central orb, which darts its beams on every side, lighting up the edges of rolling clouds, and playing upon the colossal Muses. But as you look you become aware of a godlike face, forming the centre of that splendour, from whose eyes and brow those rays are shooting, the brightest from his brow. No one before Tintoretto had conceived the idea of painting the Sun-god in the sun. In comparison with this piece of magnificent mythology the " Leda" and the " Milky Way" seem uninteresting. Of the portraits, two (263 and 266) give no adequate idea of the painter's poower. It is all kept for the third-Lord Abercornms picture, a keen man withi grizzled brows overhanging eyes where the fire of youth still burns, and a long white beard flowing down over an ermine-bordered robe of crimson cut-velvet, painted with a splendour of colour of which no words can give an idea. And yet, gorgeous as the dress is, it is secondary to the face-so full of relentless determination and piercing insight. When we see such a picture as this we are led to think that only with such sitters, so arrayed, was such painting possible. Of Paolo Veronese, that highest expression of Venetian decorative resources, the Exhibition contains the four large allegoricalcompositions-part of the adornment of some palace-from the Orleans collection, styled " Le Respect," " L'Amour Heureux," "Le DNgolt," and "L'Infidelit6" (271-274) by no means first-rate examDles of the painter, "Le Degout," the least significant, "L'Infidelite" the most easily intelligible-a beautiful woman, her back to the spectators, sliding a note into a young man's hand, while she accepts the caress of a second and older lover. Here, too, is the large sketch from Mr. Rogers's collection of "The Magdalene Anointing the Saviour's Feet" (2,5)-the study for the great picture in the Duraz7o Palace at Genoa, the " Rebecca at the Well (276), and " The Marriage of St. Catherine (280), the former exhibited at the British Institution in 1856 by Lord Yarborough, both genuine works of the painter, with enough of his gem-like colour preserved from the hands of the cleaner to give us an imperfect conception of what their splendour may once have been. A raw and recent-looking half-length female portrait, with hair of that warm auburn which we should call "carotty" -attributed to Paris Bordone (A.]). 1500-1570), and a weak treatment of the Baptism of Christ (178), by Battista Franco (A.]). 1458-1561),-a painter who made a feeble attempt to combine the style and colour of the Venetian and Roman schools with three unimportant examples of Bassano (281 282, 282a), complete the series of the Venetian painters whose original power-after stooping from the high region in which moved the Belliniss Giorgione, Titian, and Tintoretto to the ignoble subjects and anidealized rendering of still life and low life of the Bassano family-degenerated into vicious and destructive mannerism by the close of tbe l6theentury. Zuccherocarried some reflex of the magic of Venetiancolour withhimtc England, where hetbecame one of the favourite painters of Eizabeth We should have noticed in its place a fine portrait by Pordenone, the contemporary and rival of Titian, of a young Venetian gentleman, full of thoughtful and refined beauty. It hangs in Saloon A, under the number 217. We do not know that any useful purposes would be served by an enumeration of the large and numerous works of the eclectic school of Bologna, which arose under the teaching of the Caracci, at the end of the sixteenth century. Those who are disposed to give attention to the masters of this schoolwhich, vainly essaying to combine all the characterise tic excellencies of preceding masters, gradually sank into the most offensive and emptiest display of mere technical skill-will find here an abundant series of examples, including three large pictures of LIudovico Caracci4 one (321) "A Mladonna and Cbild adored by Saints," formerly in the collection of Mr. Rogers, and not vithout a certain granQena- in spite of the blackness of its shadows. Ac "Madonna and Child" (340), where there is a fine expression of tenderness in the Virgin's worn face; some 10 pictures by Annibale Caracci,of which the moat interesting are the celebrated composition of "The Three Marie" (327), from Castle Howard-the capo d'cpera of the school, and really rising to an unusual height of genuine emotion in the expression of the women who support the faintimg mother, sucd an "Assumption" (328), formerly at Hafodhonse, and sent here by the Duke of nlewcastle, where the saints in the lower part of the picture exhibit Bomething of the graadeur of Venetian colour, and the kneeling Virgin in the upper part has a serene and simple dignity. There is a high deOgree of that stateliness which was the painter's highest quality in the large composition of the ' Madonna and Child, attended by St. John, St. Margaret, and the Magdalen," originally painted for a convent at Lucca, and contributed to the Exhibition by the Speaker. Those who wish to see how low the Caracci could stoop in their naturalism will be gratified by the huge picture of a butcher's shop, in which Annibale has introduced his family group, among full-length carcasses of lambs and calves, and a masterly imitation of all conceivable varieties of joint and offil. Nor is Guido less sufficiently represented herein his "COleopatra with the Asp," from Windsor; an " Assumption," apparently a group painted for a ceiling, exhibited by Mr. J. S. Harford, in which the merely theatrical conception and arrangement deserves notice; a second-rate half-length " St. Sebastian," from the gallery of Lord Ward, and, far the best of the master's works here (342), "Salome receiving 'the head of St. John the Baptist from a Kneeling Page," selected from the gallery of Lord Yarborough. Domenichino, the most thoughtful painter of the same school, is represented by Lord Warwick's " David and Goliah," in which the slenderness of the stripling's arms is powerfully contrasted with the giant bulk, on which he kneels, scarce able to wield the ponderous sword. A characteristic example of the same master, both for nobleness of expression and dryness and hardness of execution and poverty of colour, is the " St. John the Evangelist" (349), with the attendant eagle bearing his pen, so well known by Miller's engraving, sent here from Castle Howard. The Queen, too, has contributed thefamous "St. Agnes," from Windsor Castle. Thesmall replica of "the Dead Christ watched by Angels " is the only work of the 14 or 15 specimens of Guercino in the Exhibition in which we can find any sentiment to ennoble the conventional forms and heavy colours of this much overrated painter. But the portrait of "Christina of Sweden!' (362) is curious as exhibiting that eccentric Sovereign in the man's attire she loved to wear with the crown and sceptre on the table by her side. It has, however, no particular merit as a work of art. Before leaving the schools of Italy, as they sink into hopeless decrepitude, empty displayof skill and sickly affectation, in the hands of Albano Carlo Dolce, and Maratti, we should repair our neglect in passing without notice the examples of Correggio (A. D. 1494-1534) here shown. They are not so numerous as might have been wished, eonsidering the pre-eminence of the master in modelling and chiar' oscuro; but they include works of high and peculiar interest, particularly the colossal angels' heads (403, 404), in fresco, from Lord Ward's collection. These heads undoubtedly formed part of the celebrated decorations of the apse of the Church of San Giovanni at Paria, removed in the last century for the purpose of enlarging the choir. They are deserving of careful study as exhibiting the breadth which the painter put into work intended to be seen from a distance, and as examples of masterly skill in indication of form by the simplest and largest means. Here, too, is the celebrated " Reading Madonna," the repetition of that still more famous one of the Dresden Gallery. This picture is little, if at all, inferior in serene expression, melting sweetness of oolour, and perfection of modelling, tothe Dresden picture. The background is much fuller than the Dresden picture of detail, due probably, in great measure, to the Roman painter Vallati, who recently restored the picture at Rome. Its history is curious. When it was originally purchased by the person from whom LordWard obtained itit hadanotherpictureindistemper painted entirely over it. Probably, the first purchaser had detected traces of the underpainting when he bought the picture. Be this as it may, he had the upper picture removed, and the Correggio was revealed. Bat on this beautiful work comiaig to light the seller laid claim to a restitution of the picture, as not being that which he had sold for re forget what smaUl amount of scudi. The cause was in litigation for several years, and ultimately, if we remember aright, the purchaser's full right over the picture was confirmed. But the Pope forbade its removal from his dominions, and it was only by the personal influence of Lord Ward that the embargo was at length taken off, and the picture given up to him in exchange for his English guineas. Beyond doubt the picture is masterly, and, after close examination of it, with the recollections of the Dresden picture present to us, we cannot detect any marks of inferiority to that celebrated work in Lord Ward's repetition. The sweet little head of " The Virgin oinsing the Child" (399), from Lord Carlisle's colection, is full of the peculiar tenderness and grace of the master, visible even on the infinitesimal scale of this diminutive oval; the fine portrait of the sculptor, " Baccio BandineUi" (400), from Hampton-court, is no doubt familiar to most of our readers. The Spanish and German schools must form the subject of a future article. The principal moral read in the history of this the latter stage of Italian art is the elevating and strengtheningeffect of portraiture and noble decoration, even after its devotional occupation was gone. The recaU of painting from such purposes by the eclectic Bolognese school back to such religious painting as was possible in the 17th century, instead of regenerating, served only to degrade art, by depriving it of all genuineness and vitality. The execution of large altar pieces became the most soulless of al trades ever plied bypainter. This contemptible handicraft has gone on in Italy uninterruptedly from that time to this without producing a single great or even second-rate master. Painting becomes vital again only when dealing with men and life in the hands of the Spanish Velasquez and the Flemish Rubens. Wednesday, the third of the shilling days, showed a steady improvement in numbers, the admissions being 5,370 on payment, of whom 1,996 vere brought by railway. In addition to these there were 1,261 admitted by season tickets, making a total of 6,631 persons. Of the strangers a good many were by railway from Liverpool and from the surrounding manufacturing towns; and the visitors included some worknen and their wives, with a more than usual proportion of people from theag,ricultural districts. A number of additional pictures have been placed in all the galleries, including some interesting portraits inthe central hall. In the transept some additional sculpture has been placed, in bronze and marble. A very fine bronze figure of Mercury is among these; ard in marble are busts of Her MAajesty, the late Duke of Wellington,Pitt, Cannin,I bert Stephenson, Bidder, John Rennie, James Watt, Wieland, Wordsworth, Mloore, and Tennyson. Yesterday was the half-crown day, and, notwithstanding a heavy fall of rain, there was a large influx of the more wealthy and fashionable visitors up to 3 'clock, including many who paid for admission, besides a considerable number of seasonticket holders. Mr. Donald commenced giving hot dinners yesterday afternoon, and there was a heavy demand upon the very complete and efficient arrangements of this important branch of the establishment. Among the visitors was Judge Ialliburton. In addition to visits expected from the Society of Arts and the Law Society, the Institute of Mechanical Engineers have decided upon holding meetings at Manchester on the 24th and 25th of June, with a view to visiting the Art Treasures Exhibition. Ax OLD NuIsAwcE.-The frequent breaking-up of the streets by labourers repaing pipes was brought be. fore the Board of Works for the Holborn district at the last meeting. It appears there is *another very serious leakage from the mains of the New River Company in Holborn, opposite the end of Red Lion-street," and the necessarbreaking up of the street *' makes the 67th opening for the repair of the various companies' pipes since the work has been completed, 59 of which have been opened by the New River Company." The contractors for the new paving write :-" We are of opinion that had ordinary care been exercised on the part of the companies at the time the pavement vas laid down in examining the mains and pipes when exsed, there would have been no necessity fic dis;ub~~=h pavomeat as at present."

Mr. BRADY asked the Under-Secretary for War whethor it was the intention of Her Majesy's Government to in. elude the militia medical service in the inquiries about to be instituted relative to the Army Medical Department. Sir T. RAMSDEN replied in the negative. THE UNIVERSITY OF ST. ANDREW'S. Mr. E. ELLICE wished to put a question to his right hon. friend the President of the Committee of Privy Council with reforence to a statement represented to have been made by him of the manner in which medical degrees were conferred by theUaiversity of St. Andrew's. His right hon. friend was represented to have said that those degrees were made a matter of commerce, and given without regard to the qualifications of the candidate. Now, this 'was wholy at variance with facts, and he wished to give his right hon. friend the opportunity of correcting the impression that had gone abroad, by asilng him whebter ho had intended to make the statement attributed to him. Mr. W. COWPEPR had no hesitation in informing his hon. frlend that if the impression to which he referred had beeu conveyed by what he had said, he must have been greatly misunderstood. He (Mr. Covwper) articularly stated that the practice of giving diplomas withont examination was one which formerly prevailed at the University of St. Andrew's, bnt which had ceased. He mentioned the old practice as an llustration of the necessity for the adoption of more definite rnles than at present esisted, but lhe never meant to imply tha& Tht practce previled at tb present time.

They did not inz pny case grant half-pay, but only enabled the Treau7 give itto officers holding evil appointments. The situations texisenehtbo hon. and gallant menmber had referred-were iu eistence before this Act was passed, and had always beern considered, not as civil offlces within its terms, but as retire. ments for naval officers.

Mr. VANCB in rising to move that the House resolve itself into committee to consider a Bill relating to this snub jeet, said that the object which he had in view was torelieve A particular class of traders from an impost whiclr ought to be extended over the whole community. In the reign of George III. an Act had been passed to build a, snnaU pier at a place called Dunlesary, the old name for Kingetown, for the benefit of the trade of Dablin, and cer. tatn duties were imposed upon the traders of Dublinto- arryou thatplan Subsequently a Bil had been pass&e to make a general harbour of refuge, but by some inadver. tence those duties upon the traders of Dublin were sll maintained. It would be as absurd to contend that the, people of Wales should pay for the harbour of Holyhead, or tnat the people of Bent should py for the harbour of Dover, as that the inhabitants of Dublin should pay for a. harbour of refuge open to vessels of all countries in the world. The commission upon local dues had recommended, the abolition of those impos*t, and the collector in Dublin bad stated that the port of Drogheda derived more benefit from the harheur of Kingstown than Dablin did. The President of the Board of Trade, also, in a general Bill which he had introduced, had provided for tho abolition ofthat impost. If that Bil werc again introduced, it might not pass during the present sesdon, and therefore it was. that he brought forward the present motion. There were also other imposts, levied for the maintenance of the Corn. Exchange and the Royal Exchange, which might weeU be abolishe, the Royal Exchange not having been used for commercial purposes for a considerable period. He had been requested to adopt that course by the Chamberof Commerce of Dublin, and he hoped that thet House would agree to his motion. The hon. gentleman concluded by mnoving that the House resolve, ltself into a committee to consider a Bill to repea certain duties on ships entering the port of Dablin, andc other imposts affecting its trade and commerce. Mr. LOWE said that under ordinary circumstanoss he, would not have objected to the introdnction of the Bill, but the circumstances of the present case wore so peculiar that the Government felt bound to prevent the hon. gentleman advancing a single step, and he would briefly infornm the House of the reasons which had led them to that conclusion. The amount annuallyzaisedby the impost referrea to by the hon. gentleman was about 3,0001. Now, Govern. ment had advanced from time to time no less than3lD,000W., for the purpose of maldng Kingstown habour, 'which had& been intended to improve the port of Dublin. Now, 3,0001. was a very small amount of interest up3n. 314,0001. Thenagain, inaddition to that sum, the debt upon the Corn Exchange had been paid out of the consolidated fund. The proposition of the hou. gentleman, coming forwarad on behalf of debtors, therefore, was that the debt shouldbe cancelled. Now, that was a proposition so extsa, ordinary that he felt bound to oppose it in liw.ine ; thera was, however, still another thing to be taken into account. It was true that tho Government received the sum of 3,0001. a-year as interest upon the 314,0001. that had been expended; but at the same time they paid 2,500W. a-year to the BEllast Board of Dablin, as compensation for the differential duties upon foreign ships. So that, in point of fact, the hon. gentleman proposed that the Government should cancel the, debt due to it, and continue the payment of 2,5001 a-year. It was trae, as stated by the hon. gentleman, that a provision in the Bill which he had introduced, last session wrould have abolished thoso charges, but that, would only have been carrying out a general system, and a, principle might bo just if universally applied which was unjust if applied to a single and particular case. The prin. ciple of his measure had been that all duties levied upon shipping which were not applied for shipping purposs. should be abolished, and no one had been more opposed tothat principle than the hon. gentleman. The effect of that Bill would have been to abolish the payment of the 2,500L as well as of the 3,0001. That Bill had not passed, and he should submit to the iHouse that until they were in a position to deal with the whole subject in a comprehen8ive and definite manner they should not sanction the precedent that debtors to the Imperial Government for money received might come forward 'with a proposition in that House the effect of which would be to. cancel their own debts. (Hear, hear.) 'Mr. GROGAN said he had listened to the ,peech of the nrghtnhon. entlemanwithconsiderablesurprise. Theright hon. gentleman contended that because the Government had advanced a certain sum of money for the con. struction of a harbour of refuge at Kisgstown they were justified in continuimg to levy upon the city of Dublin a duty amounting to 3,0001. per annum. The 3ight hon. gentleman, however, had expressed himself as having been perfectly willing to abandon that charge in his measure of last year, and it seemed to him (Mr. Grogan) that the ight hon. gentleman was scarcely warranted in refusinz remedy a manfest injustice ecause ho U thought propr to pronounce that measure an act of confiscation.ihe duty 'was one v.hich operated most injuriously upon the trade of Dublin, and in order to Drove that such was the case he should enter into a few details, connected with the subject. Any foreign vessel might gointo the harbour of refuge in Kingstown and ayno toll, whereas if she proceeded to Dublin she wasUble to A. charge of 4d. per ton; and he should like to know how it could be sad that it would be just to continue that charge because a largo sum of money had been spent upon the harbour. The next duty was one of 2s. upon entries outward from the Custom-house, and with the permission of the House he would cal their attention to a few instances im order to show the practical working of the tax. It aggregate amount had been 211. 13s. upon the cargo of a vessel which had arrived in Dublin from Oporto on te 3ht of May, 184; while in the case of the ship Creole, which had entered that port from Cadiz in 1838, it hadamounted to 311 Is. 6d. A charge of 31L 10s. had been levied upon the cargo of the ship Douglas, which had reached Dublin on, the 17th of February, 1845; while upon that of the OldEngland, which had ben chartered by a Dublin merchant>i and which had arrived in that city in 188, a duty of 131L 12s. had been imposed. (Hear, hear.) How was itpossible, he would ask, that, under these circumstances, the trade of the port could increase ? The consequence of the imposition of the duty, indeed, had been that the, trading co mmnity of Dubli found it to their interest to have their goods brought from foreign countriesto Liverpool and thence to transhipthem to Irelandb Theytook that course because, although when Kingstown harbour bdha originally been constracted, the duty had been made payable on all goods imported into Dablin, yet owing to the influence exercised by importnt commercial interests in England the charge upon the cross-chaunel trade had been subsequently abolished Great injury to tho port of Dblin had been the result and he should therefore, appeal from. the right hon. gentleman to the noble lord at the head of the Government to take the matter into his. consideration, and to accede to tho proposition of his hon. friend near him, wbich. while it aimed at the abolition of certain duties, differed from the measure of last year in the circumstance that it left severalother charges in the positioa in which they now stood. (Hear hear.) The CtA1-LOR of the E1XCHEQUER said the twohon. members for Dablin, with that fraternAl unanimity by which they were distinguished (a laugh), proposed to the House the remission of ertn local dues in the abolition of which their constituents 'were interested, andi in doing so founded their arguments upon a principle to which he hopecd the House would not accede. They had opposed the general measure'whichhadbeenlaidbefore Parliamentlastyear-and which wouldhave indudedaunderitsoperation the partieular duty under discussion-and yet sought to xemove that duty which had not been originally levied for the Government, but which had been transferred to them as a securityforadvances of money made by the Imperial Treasury for the benefit of the port of Dublin, and which aforded bus a small rate of interest on the advances thus made. He did not mean to deny that the charge, to a certain extent, presse& halshly upon the trade of that city, hut the very same obiection wsz applicable to other duties with which the Bill of the hon. member did not propose to deal. (Hear, hear.) No benefit c7sld arise from going into comomittee upon a motion which, as the Ouse wasalready perfectly aware, had for itsobject nothing more than the simple repeal of a duty, and he should thereforefeel bounmd tooppos it. Colonel FRENCH expressed his surpriso at the course which the Government had taken in reference to the Bill but the fact was they apeared to make the case of Irelana. iVwaysex0eVoal.

LONDO2V, FRBDAY, MAY 22, 18T. The House of Lords did not sit yesterday. In the House of Commons Mr. VANCE moved that the E[ouse resolve itself into a committee in order that he might obtain leave to bring in a Bill to repeal certain duties on ships entering the port of Dublin, and other imposts affecting its trade and commerce. Although this appeared to be a matter of local interest, he observed, it was really one of general concern, and he insisted upon the absurd, ridiculous, and unfair character of some of the charges upon ships entering the harbour of Eingstown. Mr. LowF explained the peculiar circumstances of this case, which, he said, induced the Government to think it their duty to resist the motion. After a short discussion the House divided, when the motion was negatived by 253 to 133. Mr. SPOOXER moved a resolution, " That this House do resolve itself into a committee to consider the Acts forthe endowment of Mlaynooth, with a view to the withdrawalof any endowment out of the Consolidated Fund, due regard being had to vested rights and interests." In stating the reasons which induced him to renew this motion, he disclaimed any quarrel with Roman Catholics and aU ambitious moLtives, the task being, he said, a very painful one, which an Imperative senie of duty alone compfArJ him to undertake. He proceeded to argue that il'*t liasment, by tbis grant, paid for the te i.of: doctrines hostile to the Protestant vonotutitnAsud to the principles of civil and religious liberty, d&4 structive of morality, and antagonitctotho 1R1formedEstablished Church, which the SovnxraX by the Coronation Oath, and Parliament by the - Oath of Allegiance, were bound to maintain. He denied that there had been any Parliamentu con. trect in this matter; Sir X PErL, on intdulcin tie measure of 1845, distinctly atted that it had not been a subject of stipulation or oentrwl. - upon former occaions, he read extracts from worAk o iloman Catholic writers of high authorit, efnunciating docineg subversive of morals thi, ae aid, were only a few samples of a most abomsinable systemn; ana he aked whether thes doctrinles and the denunciation of thows who Were stigmatizea as heretics-doctrines immoral and rebellious-oughtfto be taught at the expense of a Christian auda Protestant assembly.

Re pointed out various difficulties which would have to be encountered inthis alteration of the law, and the grades of distinction between trusts, some being direct, others resulting, and it woould be necessaryto consider what were the species of trusts which should be exempted from the criminal category. Tlere were other parties who did not stand in the legal relation of trustees-such as directorj and. managers of joint-stock companies, whom his Bill would render criminally responsible in cases of keeping false accounts, making fal entries, issuing false representations accompanied by acts to give colour thereto, and paying dividends out of capital; these clauses would also extend to assignees of bankrupts and insolvents. The criminal liability would not interfere with civil remedies. The ATrONEY-GENTrAL explained with much perapicuitythe mainfeatures of some of the details of this instalment (as he termed it) of useful law ieforzn, which he thought would have the effect of repressing the frequent recurrence of the offences against which it was aimed, and he intimated in the course of his speech his determination to try whether the law as it stood was not strong enough to reach the delinquencies with which the public had recently been so familiar. AIr. MALsINs expressed his satisfaction at the measure, which, he added, however, would require great care, in order that it might be at once effective and at the same time not go too far. After a few words from MIr. RADEnw and Mr. 'NAPIER, leave was given to introduce the BiLL The ATToRxBY-GSNERAL then moved for leave to bring in a Bill to amend the Act 7th and 8th VlIcronIA cap. 111, facilitating the winding up the affairs of joint-stock companies unable to meet their pecuniary engagements, and also the Joint-Stock Companies Winding-up Acts, 1848 and 1849. He explained the defective working of the existing law, aud its oppressive action through the want of authorized representatives of creditors to make valid andbinding arrangements or compromises with shareholders; and he proposed by this Bill to enable creditors to elect a representative who could accept a composition and bind the whole body, and to authorize shareholders as soon as terms of arrangement were agreed upon to apply to the Court and obtain protection fromvexatious suits, on giving security to fulfil those terms. AIr. MALIS suggested that it would be an improveMent if as soon as a winding-up order was obtained the right of suing the shareholders should cease. Air. DEASY spoke in favour of tho measure. Mr. WYLD likewise approved the Bill, but hoped the suggestion of AIr. uIAws would not be adopted. The ArIORotEY-GENERAL added a few further explanations, and the House having resolved itself into a committee upon the Acts, a resolution was agreed to, upon which leave was asked and obtained to introducethe Bill. A motion by Mr. 3OIJoRBAxxs, that the Committee on Contracts (Public Departments) do consist of 17 members, instead of 15, was opposed by Colonel BOLDERO and supported by Lord PAL1IERSTO.f. After a short conversation the House divided, when the motion was carried by 136 to 83. On the motion that MIr. oI0szXLL should be one of the two additional members, Colonel BOLDERO inveighed against thi5 attempt to augment the number of Government officials upon this committee. Mlr. HAYTER stated the circumstances counected with the formation of the committee, the first list of which he considered unfair. A discussion of some length ensued, but the motion was agreed to. The House, after some further business, adjourned at half-past 11 o'clock.
At 2 o'clock on WVednesday morning, as the House of Commons was breaking up, Nr. DisRAuin was invited by a " very great personage," who could be no other than Lord PAtERSmo, to call upon him to confer witb him on a subject of deep moment. He was obl;ged to decline, however, in consequence of an engagement to dine at a farmers' ordinary at NTewport Pagnell, upon which that great personage observed, with much simplicity and nature, " Good GOD, what can you say to " them T' Mrr. DISRAmLr accounts for this burst of sympathy and suirprise by the fact of the PnxS-N= never having represented the cou-nty of Bucks, the yeomanry of which he compliments on their hereditary interest in political questions. Possibly his Lordship forgot at the moment to do justice to the never-failing readiness of the member for BucLks, to the ample stores of his memory or his portfolio, and, more than all, to his bold disregard of local or temporary considerations, when a speech was to be made, and must be made, at any cost, any risk, and upon some topic or other. Mr. DrsrAELi has certainly treated his constituents at the Anchor Hotel with an entertaining speech, but we are not sure we have not read most of it before, and are very sure we shaU read all of it again. In fact, these Bueldnghamshire farmers have most ruthlessly waylaid their heavily-burdened representative, and robbed him of his political outfit for this and the next Session. It is all the more pity, as the articles do not fit them. The unexpected relief of the metallic currency, aud of all debtors in gold, by the Californian an4ustralian discoveries is a veryold affair, only intedhmed by Air. DISRALI on the present occasion. lub* coupled with an honest confvAe.oa that
The culminating point of a rough run between Dover and Calais is not a pleasant thing, nor is the tenth spoonfil of an electuary of which treacle is the basis very delightful to the palate. iler. SPOONER, too, when on the subject of Maynooth, rather palls upon the jaded attention of his hearers. He comes upon one with the effect of that awful lurch which is implied in our first illustration, and of that tenth spoonful of treacle more directly enunciated in the second. What can a man be made of who year after year perseveres with a proposition which has been so frequently rejected by the majority of reasonable and honourable men throughout the country, and which is marked with so many Parliamentary scars ? One is sick of Mr. SPOONER in his Maynooth mood as of a barrelorgan which plays the same tune for years, or of anything which is a monstrous and ever-recurrent bore. Last night he was at the old work again, and last night his proposition was again rejected, without any Ministerial opposition, and by a majority of 125 to 91. It is not to be supposed that twenty persons in the country will read the report of his speech which will be found in our Parliamentary notice of this day. Two only of his own party were found to sit it out. We can spare our readers all trouble upon the subject by the simple announcement that the Maynooth motion has been negatived by the new Parliament, which has also shown its appreciation of it by rejecting it almost without debate.
The most serious evils have arisen from the indiscrininate sale of poisons. Every one's memory-will readily supply him with a hideous catalogue of murders and accidents referable to this cause. Now it is some ruffian like PAL=iER-to be sure, he was a medical man-who purchases a parcel of strychnine as freely as he could buy a quartern of flour; now it is some miserable errandboy, who serves out a phialfull of laudanum in place of black draught. In country districts arsenic is freely sold like any other marketable commodity, and under the name of " Quietness rowders," or some other title taken from the nomenclature of quack medicines, the most deadly compounds are sorved out on Saturday nights to goodwives who wish to get rid of their husbands in a colourable manner, or who may really desire to administer what they believe to be an apt remedy for a particular ailment. Now, all this is very bad. Some arrangement was clearly necessary to place the sale of poisonous drugs under check and restraint, and such arrangement was attempted by the 14th and 15th of VICTORIA. The provisions, however, of this Act have been found insufficient, and now another measure has been brought in which incorporates most of the suggestions which have from time to time been offered upon the subject; but which, unless we are much mistaken, will be found to overshoot the mark on the side of restriction. It may be very right to prohibit the indiscriminate sale of lethal drugs; but then a number of the substances which are comprised under this category are at the same time remedial agents when used in moderation. Under the new Act, a person who may be taken ill in the street, and who thereupon steps to the nearest apothecary's shop for a dose of the medicine which he may be in the habit of taking on such occasions-let us suppose laudanum-will be met with a flat refusal. Any drug which is placed in the schedule of the Act under the head " Poison " must henceforth only be sold to a person of full age, in presence of a witness of ful age, and upon the production of such a certificate as is prescribed by the statute. This certificate must be in writing, and be signed by the clergyman of the parish or district, or by a legally qualified medical practitioner, or by a justice of the peace acting for the county or place. It must state "that the person giving the "certificate knows the applicant. and believes "that the poison may be safely supplied to "him, and is to be used for the purpose of his "trade, or for some other lawful purpose, to be "mentioned in such certificate." Now, let us suppose the not very extraordinary case of a person who is suddenly attacked with a pain in his bowels-the fruit season is at hand; or it may be with a nervous ailment, and who, rightly or wrongly, may wish for a small dose of laudanum to quiet his throbbing nerves or that perturbed nether world which is causing him so much discomfort. He ruishes in, pale and eager, to the nearest druggist's, and calls aloud for a small dose of laudanumbut where is the witness of full age and the certificate ? It may be that the applicant is a man of forecast, and walks about with a certificate in his pocket, signed by the clergyman of his parish, and he may have been fortunate enough to meet with an acquaintance in the street, who consents to vouch for him as freefromhomicidalmonomania,but subject to bodily infirmity. The apothecary glances at the certificate. " ReaUy, Sir, I am very sorry, " but the certificate must be signed by the clergy" man of the parish or district; that is the language " of the Act. I grieve to inform you that it is "only in St. Botolph you can find relief. We are now in Marylebone." Or a wretched creature may be affected with the toothache, and be willing at the moment to barter all his earthly belongings for a pinch of wool saturated with landanum; but he must go grimacing about the streets til nature, kinder than the British Parliament, consents to alleviate the pain. The nearest doctor, the nearest justice of the peace, and the nearest clergyman, are the only individuals who can even partially help him out of his difficulty, for the little embarrassment about the witness of full age still remains. Against some of the provisions of the Act we have not a word to say, and we therefore trust that the blemishes we have pointed out may be remedied in Committee. Colourless solid poisons are henceforth to be mixed with soot or indigo-colourless liquid poisons with archil. All poisons are to have a covering of tinfoil, and, when liquid, the bottle which contains them must have the word " Poison " distinctly moulded upon it. In order to avoid evasions of the Act it is provided that the "gift," of , any poison is to be subject to the provisions applicable to " sales." The prescriptions of medical men are, of course, exempted from the operation of the statute; so are sales by wholesale to retail dealers, and to persons carrying on certain specified trades. It is very proper to require that all poisons should be labelled and kept apart in the shops and dispensaries of all apothecaries and medical practitioners. The Act also contains a wholesome provision with regard to poisonous medicines for external use, which has been often suggested before. It is to the effect, that all such medicines should not be delivered otherwise than in bottlu of coloured glass and of a quadrangular shape. It Waluld seem wise to add. that such bottles should naot be used for any otlh,. purpose. $rarcely a year passes in which we, do. not rea.1l oi some dc@fil ttazgedy arising *om a misOlos. probably made- im the darl, 1E.ween. two WtIs, the {; containg a. ilravh3, tb& other a lotion for external use. Such praviB ons as those we have specified are well enough, nor do we complain that the indiscriminate sale of poisons to chance customers should be put under restraint, but the restraint contemplated is too severe, and will work inconvenience to the public. Surely it would not entail any very serious dangers on the people of this country if anwapothecary were permitted to furnish an applicant with a few drops of laudanum for use in the shop. We have heard, indeed, that under the present system it has been known that persons meditating a poisonous attack upon their neighbour's life have gone about from shop to shop, collecting a few drops here and a few drops there, until at last they had possessed themselves of a dose sufficient for the accomplishment of their murderous design. A man, however, who wished to commit suicide could scarcely effect his purpose by swallowing a small quantity of laudanum sufficiently diluted in one shop, and a small quantity in another. The probability is he would fall asleep by the way. We are bound to say that we are not aware of any method by which the purpose of the Legislature could have been carried into effect other than by the one actually adopted. It would have been as preposterous as it would have been impossible to attempt any general definition of poison. The greater proportion of our drugs are poisons if they are usedin sufficientquantityand withsufficient regularity. Therecan be little doubt that a child-murdres, could accomplish her purpose by the steady administration of any of the ordinary purgative medicines, and certainly an adult could poison himself with blue pill. It is far better to aay once for all, "The sale of certain drugs, simple or compoumided, "is forbidden, save under certain conditions. "Here is a list of the prohibited articles." For ourselves, we place much reliance upon the gradual extension of scientific and general intelligence among the druggists as a class, and regret that the trade cannot be brought under more stringent regulation, for no restraint of police or statutory check would be so efficient as that check and that restraint which educated druggists would themselves supply. It is not absolutely necessary for the public convenience that deadly substances and drugs should be sold at every village shop, and we think some provision for confining the sale of such articles to properly accredited establishments might be introduced with advantage. From the point of the " quietness powders," and "(elixirs," and other quack medicines of a poisonous nature we turn aside in sheer despair.
The questions at issue between the Poor Law Board, the parochial authorities of Marylebcne, and Sir BEwJAXIN HAnL deserve particular attention just now, as illustrating certain points of administration recently under discussion. At the beginning of the present year two of the Conommissioners in Lunacy paid a visit to Marylebone Workhouse for the purpose of inspecting the condition of the insane and weakminded inmates. The opinions they formed of the management prevailing were so unfavourable that these were communicated to the Poor Law Board, who thereupon despatched an Inspector to the Yarylebone Board of Guardians with instructions to enter upon the subject. The Guardians, however, rejected this interference, and refused to hold communication with the Inspector, or to recognize his mission. The Poor Law Board, finding themselves excluded from intervention in this direction, proceeded to remonstrate with the Guardians by letter, but to no better purpose than before, under which circumstances they have at length threatened to enforce their authority by the aid of the Queen's Bench. To avert these measares, and to stop proceedings which must necessarily be both disagreeable and expensive, the Guardians applied to Sir BurJAblr- HAL, and requested him, at an interview which we yesterday reported, to employ his good offices in protecting the independence of the parish, as Mr. HuE had once done in times gone by. On the immediate question there appears little room for doubt. Of course, the Marylebone Guardians, like all other authorities, are jealous of interference, and there is no denying that selfgovernment or local government, if it is to be a reality, should be protected from undue menace or control. This, however, is now a point of law, not of policy. If, by the statutes referred to, power is conferred on the Poor Law Commissioners of deputing an Inspector to the meetings of the Board of Guardians, parochial independence becomes affected, of course, and the only remaining question concerns the applicability of such provisions to the particular case under consideration. We cannot doubt that the state of things in the Marylebone Workhouse was such as to call for intervention. The report of the Lunacy Commissioners described very serious defects in the accommodation and attendance provided for the insane, and the committee appointed to consider this, report on behalf of the parish did certainly confirm it on many substantial points. In fact, there is no question about the abuses which existed, and the main argument on behalf of the parochial authorities-that until greater space could be obtained it was impossible to effect such reforms as might be desired-admits by implication the objections taken to the present state of affairs. But at what point is interference to stop ? The officers of a parish may perhaps ask what is the meaning of self-government if they are to admit the government of others? And there cannot, of course, be two opinions as to the inexpediency of consuming upon law expenses an amount of money which, if applied to the reforms under discussion, would have prevented any dispute at all. Mr. HODGES observed at the interview that, " whatever " might be the result of legal proceedings, the ex" penses would have to be paid out of the pockets " of the taxpayers, either out of the Consolidated " Fund on the one side, or the pockets of the rate" payers of Malaylebone on the other ;"-a view of the case unquestionably prudent. But the proceedings apprehended can be stopped by other means than that of Sir B. H1Li's mediation. They would cease at once upon compliance with the requisitions of the Poor Law Board; or, ii this should be thought incompatible with the freedom of the parish, the difficulty, as Sir B. Mu intimated, might be escaped by the prompt application of sufficient remedies to the evils complained of. Here, in fact, we arrive at the turning point of the question. Havre the Marylebone a-uthorities so managed their affairs as to claim of right an exemption from interference ? It is all very wel to. argue that control should have its limits, but xonust independence too. Mr. HODGES was of opinio13 that "in a parish containing 160,000 inhabitants the "Guardians did their duty exceedingly wel, "and among 30,000 persoxs annually re "lieved some complaints must be expected, even "in the best managed estAlishments." Bat is the duty of the Guardians performed as werll to the relieved as it is to the relievers-as well to the poor 2s it is to the ratepayers, This case of the lunatic inmates is not the first which has been breught before the pubXlc from the same quarter. There was that of women-flogging, to which Sir B. rAn. was pedrfectly justified in referring, notwithstanding the depreeation of the Marylebone autnoi. ties The GxaardiFns have no "right divine to govern "w vrong," and when they evade the discussion of the fact's on shich proceedings have been based, ai5 t.ke tl4eir stand on the theoretical independ-. enAe of a~ parish, their position beqQIj&. a very weak one indeed. The unfoittmuate -creatures bereft of their reason were shamefulh' treated, and mainly, as the parochial Committee it5elf alleged, because the workhouse did not afford accommodation enough for better arrangements. But ,why could not this accommodation be afforded? Because space was required for some fi00 children who ought to have been provided for elsewhere. " This subject," observed Sir BmwJAmiN, " had been delayed by the parochial autho- rities for eight or ten years, but he was happy "to think it would not be very much longer "deferred." But how long would reforms be deferred if vestries and guardians were allowed to consult their own ideas of propriety, without any apprehension of interference t The bearing of all these discussions upon the great point of parochial administration in the metropolis is not likely to be overlooked, for, if the management provided under this system does not possess some evident excellence, there will remain but few considerations to counterbalance the notorious and oppressive inequalities to which the parochial distribution of Poor-rates gives rise. When the quota of one parish in the same city is four times as much as the quota of another men will certainly ask for some better justification of the difference than can be found in the organic liberties of a particular Board. The Marylobone authorities take their stand on the lofty ground of principle, and decline any allusion to practice. Sir BxIRJA- H&,L appears to have. been " called to order" repeatedly when he referred to the manner in which the affairs of the parish had been actually administered. " The deputation," observed one of its members, " does not ask your opinion on these " subjects, but wants to know, will you " assist them in their efforts to keep out "the Poor Law Board I' This was very plain speaking, but the First Commissioner of Works was quite equal to the occasion. He gave his opinion, whether it was wanted or not, and, after i portraying to these authorities their own pro- ceedings, very reasonably concluded by saying, that when the matters complained of were either actually remedied or in a fair way of being so, his mediation should be heartily at the service of the parish. The Marylebone Guardians up to a certain point have undoubtedly a right to the administration of their own affairs, but not without responsibility to an authority above their own. They must not allow women to be flogged under their rule. They must not condemn unfortunate lunatics to bad treatment h - cause their existing buildings are not large enough for the accommodation of this c&aas and that of school children too. Above all, they must not rely upon their abstract rights of independence, apart from more practical methods of self-juatification. If they can show that they are really doing their best, the Poor Law Board is certainly not so popular an institution as to absorb all the sympathies of the public to their prejudice, but when they appeal to their privileges without explaining their actual intentions they leave to others the advantages of position which they might have secured for themselves.

COURT OF COMMION COUNCIL. IiYesterday a Court was laheld for the deeatolt of publie business. DA; laviresTo.. The Court presented a very gay appearance in cones. quence of the attendance of a number of ladies to witnmiss the ceremony of presenting the freedom of the city to Dr: 11Lvingston, as a testimonial in recognition of his zealous and persevering exertions In the important discoveries he lbas made in Africa. Dr. Livingston was introduced, amid great applause, by YJ, J. E. k3aunders and Alderman Rose, the mover and recc'der of the resolution, and was addresed by Sir J. KsEY, the chcmberlain, after the declaration as a freeman vas read, in the following speech:-Admitting, Sir, as we occasionally do, to the freedom of our anecent city, by the public resolutiDn and unanimous vote of this Court, those who have rendered esential service to their coLntry and to mankind, yet hardly could two successive presentations exhibit a more striking contrast than the one recently accorded by this Court to a distinguished general and that -wbich I am tbe privileged medium of conveyi tte 3olu this day. True, Sir, in beth cases we recognize in2he objects of this honourabledistinction the friends of civili2ation, the friends of moral progress throughout the world. But the vocation of the onled h hmto seek tbe accomplishment of these objects in the grnppling vigour and rough form of war," uP palleledhabdshipeofeamp and siege-in, those incredible displays of heroism and patient endurance vwhich brought more honour to his country's name in the surrender of a fortress than its capture wi evoer procure for the foe. (Cheers.) Your calling, on the contrary, has led you to seek the honour of your ceuntry and the moral elevation of mankind by the peaceful triumphs of the m onary, by the expanding influence of scentific discovery, by preparing the Way fer that intereommunion and commerce between alienated race3 the tendency of 'which is to make a corporate guild of all nations, to unite all the tribes of earth in a bond of aniversal brotherhood, to hasten that grand millennium of the whole civilized world "when nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither sball they learn var any more." (Cheersm) But, Sir, on occasions like the present it is expected that I should explain to a newly-admitted member of our body the grounds on which this Court has designated him to an en. rolment with patriots, with heroes, with statesmen, with all who have left on their generation the stamp of great. ness, and whose labours will outlive their names. In fulfiling this expectation my only difficulty is in deciding on which aspect of your beneficent labours it will become me chiefly to insist The commercial constitution of our body, however, would perhaps suggest that I mention first that which, except as subservient to ulterior results, you would yourself only think of last. I mean the vast openings for commerce which, by means of your geographical discoveries, are now made in the interior of the African continent. Considering the enterprise and zeal which mark the age in which we live, there is perhaps hardly a fact more remarkable than the ignorance, the contented ignorance, in which we have allowed ourselves to remain in reference to this part of the world, leaving it on our maps a hopeless blank, a great unknown of waste ancd barrenness and interminable sands, as if the malediction which by some is supposed to attach to the in. habitants was thought by travellers to be extended to the soil. But what, Sir, has been edcited in the course of your laborious ourneys of 11,000 miles, through the damp morass and arid desert, across rolling torrents and under scorching suns, in feverish sickness and with wasted frame? Why, that, instead of a waste howling wilderness, there is in the heart of that unexplored continent a mine of material wealth; that nature has snattered there with lavish hand thechoicest of her products; that roots are embedded in that soil of the highest value to the healing art; that the indigo plant throws out its spreading leaf in wild and useless luxuriance- and that tusks of ivory which would be weU barterai for the best commodities of European merchandise lie rottiDg in the rain or bleachingi under a torrid sun. Nor are there wanting, we are glad to hear from you, faclities for entering upon this most desirable commerce. The African mind is awake. The Portuguese colonies are casting offtheirjealousiea. The slave dealers, taught by your wise counsels, are turniug their thoughta to the prospect of a more lawful commerce, insomuch that it seems not too much to expect that if a ship were to sail up the Zambese river to-morrow not only might it be soon filled with the most valuable materials for our home manufactures, but every facility for international barter would be afforded by the natives themselves, Sir, I mentioned the slave dealer lust now, and the word suggests an anticipated atd glorious result of your labours which, if realized, would make Africa almost worship the very sands which bore the imprint of your footsteps, and cause every wind that swept over her desert to resound with her deliverer's name. I allude to the ultimate extinction of the base trafficking in human blood, and so effacing from the world's history the foulest blot that ever stained its page. (Loud cheering.) Sir, a nation which has expended 20 millions of her money in the abolition of the slave trade, and still devotes a quarter of a million annualy to the same sacred purpose, cannot be supposed to be indifferent to any plans by which her nighteous efforts may be brought to i triumpbant issue; and if, as some of our most enlightened travellers concur with you in thinking, the Moorish slave dealer only persists in his nefarious calling because he can fiud no other gainful employment, and if, as your discoveries have abundantly proved, there is nothing to forbid the great Zambese river, teeming as it does on either side with aU that could mnirster to man's natural wants, from becoming a permanent commercial path into the interior of Central Africa, all hope favours the probability that on mere considerations of worldly policy, the trade in human flesh, and blood will soon be driven out of the field, and the last vestige disappear of a practice which for centuries has been a reproach to civilization and a stigma to the Christian name. But all this time Sir,Ifeel lam overlookingthat feature of your succeexs the jope of which first led you to embark on those perilous undertakings-successes which alone could have borne you up under the unexampled privations and dangers of the last 15 years, and which, when the ships of merchandise have ceased and the fine gold of earth shall have become dimwhen there shall be no mercenary to drag the negro from his home and no oppressor to bind on the fetters of the slave, wiU be their own satisfaction nd their own neverending reward. Yes, Sir, I am glad to be recalled from all further allusion to the commercial and social benefits of your discoveries by the remembrance that I stand in the presence not of the accomplished trave}ler only, noting down with discriminating accuracy all that could throw light on the phenomena of climes and races-Dor yet of the man of science only, enlarging the field of human thought and knowledge by the careful philosophy of his observations-nor yet of the enlightened statist only opening up to the enterprise of his country new channels for the development of the national resources,-but that I stand in the presence of a man of God, of a Christian missionary, of one who is wiling to spend and be spent in the noblest of services, and that on behalf of the most injured and oppressed of men. (Cheers.) Sir, let me in the presence of this Court and in their name do all honour to that sentiment of yours, breathing as it does the spirit of a high-toned Christian chivalry, that " the end of the geographical feat is the beginning of the missionary enterprise." Yes, Sir, what we are now doing for the evangelization of this distant continent is but the beginning of the liquidation of that righteous debt with which aU Christendom is chargeable for Africa's protracted wrongs. The first instalment of that mighty deodand whick the retribution of Heaven demands of us for the hearts we have broken, and the homes we have desolated, and the blood which has been shed, enough to have saturated whole acres of those burning sands when every year saw 150,000 of Afric's sons transported with ruthless violence to other climes to furnish victims for cupidity and fraud. Oh, Sir, what heart is there so cold as not to respond to that touching aspiration in one of your letters-" May God grant me life to do good to this poor Africa?" (Loud cheers.) In this assembly, I am sure not one. We do indeed tender you this token of our grateful esteem for yoar services to commerce, for your contribution to science, for the advanced post to which you have conducted us in the march of a moral civilization; but we would also that you shozld bear back with you to the scene of your honoured labours the assurance of our heartfelt prayer that the eye of an unslumbering Providence may watch over your path; that the promised presence of your Saviourmay cheer you under all opposition and discouragement; that idols abolished, superstition renounced, eyes opened, hearts converted may be Heaven's granted tokens to you of a prospering work; and that you may iot be called to your rest till you have witnessed the dawn of Africa's regeneration-till you haveseen her " wilderness become like Eden and her desert like the gardens of the East." (Long continued cheers) Dr. IaVm'GSION, who on rising was most warmly greeted, said,-My Lord Mayor, I beg leave to tender to your Lordship and the Court my heartfelt thanks for the honour whicl has just been conferred upon me I can only say that my heart is full (Dr. Livingston was here almost overcome with emotion). I cannot express myself in the eloquent language which has fallen from my friend Sir John Key, but 1i can asure you that it has a great effect indeed upon my heart when I see the Idnd interest that you take in Africa and the kind expressions which you make use of respecting my future labours there. (Hear, hear.) When in Africa I had not the smallest idea that I should be so highly honoured asI have,been in this country, and when I heaa the very fattering expressiens whieh are uttered ree specting my pest. labous, somLehow or other my hea, alswys goes forward to what is to eome. (Cheer%), In spcaking to mercantile men in this city, most of whom are self-made men, I need not make any alnusion te the commencement of an enterprise w&tch, ,I have notthesmalst doubt, willyet be a glorious. one, althoughb may not live to see it. Allthat I wishto e in. frica is the begining-the dawn of the future (caeera), becusa I believe that that future will be glorious,. (Renewed choers.) My LordMlayor, the capabilities ot Africa. are aexceedingly great, and I beliGev that commereahas not yeo done anything like half its work. It is just beginning t* extend itself, and Christianity is just bh'giLning wih her work for the future. (Hear, beat.) Zose years ago we knsw nothing at all of many articles of Co!amperCe whiclk now enter into the families of thepooresaolasse& yen knew r othing of gutta percba or of caontaonA, which are now applied to innumerable urea, anA I believe that in this new fertile country, whio'Y I lAve had the honour to bring to the knowledgo of E we'peans, mauy most useful articles wrill yet be tFound, and that we, feeling our dependence upon th7 t country, will do our duty in another respect.

Io thars acres and smres of small dwellings' were being pulled down; the narrowa streets- ad crolt ded alloys were bcalg got rid ot, and magoi.eeNt streets wereo being formed in their places, the consequence of whiccn was that the poor were, driven awavy and. the mechanic was obliged to live at a.distance of two or three miles from his place of wo0rk The same state of things might be said to apply' to-workmen whore avocations called the m to the city of' L ondon.

FOREIGN INTEBLLIBNCE. -FRANCE. (oRM OUR OWN OORR SPOIDMNT.1 rA portion of the folloring apponred in our smcond edi- Hnn nF -F+rl.'v _-1 PARTS, WEDNESDAY, Mar 20, 6 P.M. The Gazdte de France, the Union, and the Assemblee Yatjoele-the first two Legitimist, the third :Fusionist-continue to advocate the system of "abstention" in the forthcoming elections. The .Patrie, the Sielde, and the Jourinal des Debats, on the eontr0^ry, are in favour of the electors coming forward and exercising their political rigthts. The Emperor would, I imagine, gladly see a fair number of people deposit their voting tickets in the urn, provided they were inscribed with the names of the Government candidates. His desire is, no doubt, that an extinction of political life should not appear as the copoequence of his system, and that there should be some slight show of opposition rather than the indifference wlhich is so prevalent. The Siecle is uaturaUy anxious that the men who are the chiefs of the moderate Republicans should not by any overnice scruples throw away any chance of laying the basis of an opposition in the Legislative Body. The party generally is divided on the question of the vote of allegiance, and, if their men were returned, they wrould probably refuse to take it. The object 'which the Siecle has at heart wrould, however, be attained-that of showing that there stil exists a Republican feeling among the peoplo, which even a partial success would cherish and extend. The Gazette de France was long the advocate of " an appeal to the people." Its advocacy, however, was not so much owing to any value it set on the popular 'will as to its hostility to the Orleans dynasty. The crown was given to LJouis Philippe by a certain number of deputies who had no mission from their constituents to do so. It denied that such a gift was the act of the nation, because the nation was never consulted. Granting that the ordinances of July were as illegal as described, still the person of the Sovereign was, according to the Constitutions inviolable, and his Ministers alone were responsible; and, even admitting that Charles L justly forfeited the throne, yet that throne was not vacant.. He might have abdicated, or might have been deposed, but there was yet the Duke de Bordeaux, who had no share in the iUegalities of his grandfather, and who ought not to be made responsible for them. A change of dynasty was therefore a 'violation of justice and equity; it was still more outrageous as being the act of an almost imperceptible minority in comparison with the great national tribunal before whom the appeal, if any appeal was justifiable, should be made in so extreme a case, and who alone had the right to decide. The party represented by the Gazette de France were doubtless persuaded that the result of suoh an appeal would be the restoration of the elder branch: if any other were anticipated we should probably never have heard anything from them about the " appeal to the people ;" they would have defended their cause on the great principle of Divine right. The "appeal to the people" came, however, in a way they least expectod, and the revolution of February showed that if the Orleans Government had not taken deep root with the people the representative of legitimacy was completely ignored for all practical purposes. Neither was the " appeal to the people" mn December, 1851, the appeal meant by the Gazette dc Francee, for it did not produce the restoration of the elder Bourbons, bnt in the establishment of the Empire in the person of one whose principal, if not whose only, claim then was that lie was the nephew of one whose overthrow had been the triumph of legitiruacy. The same insincerity which characterized that party cry marks the conduct of the other parties; and universal suffrage, so long demanded by the ultra-Liberals, is only good sO far as it gives them the supremacy. The Siicde with much justice asks the Legitimist organs what has their party gained by systematicaUy refusing to exercise the rights of citizens. That party kept completely aloof during a part of the reign of Louis Philippe; for a longtime after the faUof Charles X. it refused to send deputies to the Chambers; and even when a sort of compromise took place, and Legitimists took their seats, it was hardly ever without a mental reservation to use their position for the overthrow of the Monarchy of July. That keeping aloof brought little advantage to their cause; and t.he only result was that, with the exception of a few who are influenced by a point of honour, or who are impatient to arrive at power, the Count de Chambord is nearly as much forgotten as if he slept with his forefathers. There is no party which can with impunity remain long out of the momory or sight of the people. So far as can be judged from the present feeling of the country the balloting places do not promise to be overcrowded with electors. A few of the larger towns may form an exception. In some cases the exhortations of the partisans of ' abstention,whether Legitimist or Republican, will be attended to, but if it be on a large scale it may safely be attributed to indifference to the exercise of the suffrage or to discouragement. In any uase it would seem to strengthen the opinion that the French do not yet understand the real value of freedom, or are deficient in the energy, perseverance, and moral courage necessary for its attainment, and would justify us in coming to the conclusion that the mild despotism by which it is now ruled is the boat suited to it. Baron Gros, whose departure had been prematurely annoinced, will have an audience of the Emperor to-morrow, previous to setting out for China. Despatches have been received from the French Consul at Panama. They give full details of the situation of the country. It would appear, from these accounts, that New Granada is not capable of resisting the invasion prepared by the Americans, who are likely to establish themselves without difficulty at Panama and Chagres. It is said that a conference will be held in Paris, composed of representatives of the various Powers -who have sigued treaties of commerce with Persia, in order to agree to an arrangement which will apply to all the consular agents in Persia. The conference 'will take place during the stay of the Persian Ambassador in Paris. Mehemet Pasha, Governor of Janina, is about to be named Minister of Police at Constantinople. The fearful increase of robbery and murder has forced Redschid Pasha to adopt severe measures of repression, and from the energy of Mehemet, when formerly in that post, hopes are entertained that Pera and Galata will soon be freed frora the scourge. The Presse announces that M. de Hatzfeldt, the Prussian Minister at Paris, has received instructions authorizing him to sign the protocol of the COJ1ference of Paris. " ft is further expected," adds the Presse, " that when all is concluded His Prussian Majesty will declare that he renounces the million offered as an indemnity." It is expected that the next Conference will be held on Mlonday, for signing the convention. The papers give the foluowing account of the Grand Duke Co"stantine's proceedings at Bordeaux:- " The Grand Duke Constantine arrived at Bordeaux on DMonday evening at a little before 7. Early in the afternoon crowds of persons began to assemble in the streets through 'which the Prince would pass. Although no official reception, properly so called, was to be given, General de Tartas, the Cormmandant of the Division, L de Meutquoe Prefect of the Gironde, the Mayor of Bordeaux, and the otner mun cipal authorities assembled at the terminns to welcome the 1rince. Immediately after the special train had reached the station the Grand Duke entered an open car. inage, accompanied by the General, the Prefect, and the Mayor, and proceeded to the Hotel de Ville. Five or six other carriages followed, containing the suite of the Prince and the personages of the Court in attendance on him. The cortlgc was headed aud closed by a detachment of Hussars. On reaching the Hotel de Vile, which was splendidly illuminated, the principal authorities were presented to his Imperial Highness. A grand dinner then took place, covers being laid for 30. Among the persons specially invited by the Grand Duke were General de Tartas, the Prefect, and the Mayor. The band of the 27th Regiment played during the repast. At half-past 9 thePrince left the Hotel de Viule and proceeded to the theatre, beinghailed on his passage with acclamations by the crowd. When the Prince entered theMayor's box the second act of LaPaond. 7zettewas being performed, but was for a time interrupted by all the audience rising at once, and welcoming the illustrious 'visitor with several rounds of applause, while the orchestra strck up the Russian national hymn. At the conclusion of the act a cantata, composed for the occasion, was sung. When this was finished the Prince left the house, and returned to the Hotel de Vile, where he slept. The next morning the Grand Duke visited the frigatea which are being built for the Russian Goverunent. His Imperial Bighness was present at the -launch of a French vessel, at which all the authorities were also assembled. The Grand Duko was to leave the next day (Wednesday) for Rochefort." A letter from Madrid, of the 16th, mentions that after several conferences between M. Lafrapua and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the basns of an arrangement had been agreed to. When the convention between the two Governments is signed M. Bafragua vill remain at Madrid as Minister of the Mexican Republic.. A Council of MiInisters, at which the E:mperor presided, was held yresterday morning at Fontainebleau. In the afternoon their Majesties, accompanied by the King of Bavaria, the Grand Duchess of Baden, the Duchems of Eamilton, and the other guests of the Palace, took a drive in the forest in chars-a-bano. In the evening all the Court assembled in the garden, and were presont at a night f6te. A number of morceasx were sung by the artistes and chorus of the Opera, who were placed in the summer-house which stands In the centre of the large piece of water, while boats ornamented with Venetian lanterns rowed about in every direction. Fireworks, principally consisting of squibs which ran along the surface of the water, concluded the evening, which was favoured by delightful weather.

According to a telegraphic despatch from Pesth, the Archduchess Gisella is convalescent, but her elder sister is suffering much from dysentery. The Princess Sophia, who is cutting her double teeth, has also a great deal of fever, and the Emperor and Empress are probably somewhat anxious about her, for they have summoned a physician from Vienna, whose attention is principally directed to the complaints of children. The Wiener Zeitung contains the newly planned itinerary of their Majesties, but it does not appear advisable to forward it at present, as neither the Emperor nor the Empress will quit Pesth as long as their little daughter is so unwell. Baron Sina is having apartments prepared for the reception of their Majesties in his chateau at aodlld, and one of the rooms will be furnished exactly as it was 80 or 90 years ago, when the Empress Mc riaTheresa passed a night in it. Baron Sina spends his money freely, but still he wiU find some difficulty in disbursing his annual revenue, which is somewhat above 200,0001. His Majesty has thanked Prince Schwarzenberg, the President, and Baron von Hlohenbruck, the Vice-President of the Agricultural Society, for their exertions during the Exhibition, and has given decorations to four of its other members. The Chevalier von Rleyle has received the Knight's Cross of St. Leepold,whichgives him aright to claim the rank and title of a Baron of the Empire. In a speech which he made at the first meeting of the members of the Agricultural Society, after the opening of the Exhibition, M. von Mleyle created what is commonly called a "sensation." Although a highly-placed emplo'y, he expressed his sentiments with remarkable freedom, and was rewarded for his candour by the loud applause of the assembly. The Ministerial Councillor gave his hearers to understand that bureaucratic superintendence was not necessary to the well-being of the popular institution of which they were members. On the 12th inst. the Queen of Prussia arrived at Pillnitz, the residence of the Royal family of Saxony, and on the 14th was joined by the Archduchess Sophia. The Queen of Prussia, the Archduchess Sophia,audthe Queens Amelia and Daria are sisters, and it is very probable that they have consulted together wvhether it would be advisable to give one of the Princesses of the House of Saxony to Prince Napoleon. On the 14th the French Prince dined at Pillnitz, but we have not yet heard what reception he met with from the Archduchess Sophia, who can have no great sympathy for a man who has always professed to belong to the ultra-Liberal party. It is stated that the Austrian Court is offended because the visit of the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian to Paris has not been returned, but there is no reason to believe that such is the case. Prince Napoleon went to Dresden as a suitor, and his hurried call at Berlin can hardly be considered a return visit paid to Prince Frederick Williama of Prussia. The new Danish Government has expressed its intention to act agreeably to the wishes of Austria and Prussia on the Holstein question, and those Powers have therefore agreed not to caU on the Confederation to take a share in the diplomatic nogotiations which are about to commence. The two great German Powers have simply communicated to the Bund the actual state of affairs. The whole affair, like the Neuchatel question, wiU end in smoke. We learn that the convention recently concluded between Russia and Persia was the work of General Tschirkoff's hands. Russia renounces aUl claim to the money which Persia has owed her ever since the last war, and the latter, as an indemnification, cedes two pieces of land. " The one is on the Caspian, and the other in the eastern part of Persla, and both of them, for strategical reasons, are of the highest importance to Russia." The Emperor Alexander was so well satisfied with the diplomacy of General Tschirkoff that he sent him an autograph letter of thanks, and made him his commissary in the commission for the regulation of the Russo-Turkish frontiers. PRUSSIA. (FnOM OUR OWN CORRESPON.PNT.) BERLIN, WAY 19. As the season for travelling is approaching, and there is every probability that a visit to the Rhine will have lost none of the attractions it has hitherto so powerfully exerted, allow me to caution your readers, more particularly those addicted to antiquarian pursuits, to be unusually circumspect in their purchases of Roman antiquities on the Rhine. Of late years this region has been much resorted to for Roman terracotta remains, and in it no spot has been so richly favoured as a place called Rheinzabern, in the Bavarian Palatinate. Engish, French, and German antiquaries have for some years past increased their collections with the treasures to be purchased there, and which promise to bo inex- ..u<Ue; me 2oueums ofAnilties at Paris, Munich, and Luxemburg have devoted large sums to the acquisition of them. This Rheinzabern is a place very well known to all who study Roman archzeolo-, and there is no doubt that it is the site of ancient Roman settlements, and that many a genuine anticagia has been discovered there. These undoubted facts have, however, led to an ingenious manufacture of these terra cotta articles in that favoured sDot; but unfortunately the great extent and sucs e of the undertaking have given rise to suspicion as to the genuineness of the numerous products issuing from this prolific manufactory. A vase from Rheinzabern, that was valued at 1,OOOf., lately came under the notice of the President of the Society of Antiquaries in Rheinland Professor Braun; his researches and examinations brought him to the conviction of its being a forgery, and further investigation led him to the perception that not only this vase, but also the greater part of the terracotta remains derived from that nei&h- bourhood by the Paris, Luxemburg, and Munch Museums, were spurious. Professor Becker, of Frankfort-on-the-Maine, followed up these investigations, and, in spite of the protestations of all parties concerned in the buying and selling of these articles, he arrived at the same conclusion. Very recently, moreover, the King of Bavaria sent Professor von Hefaer, a member of the Academy and a skilful antiquary, to visit Rhoninabern in the interest of science, and he has substantiated the fact of a regular manufac- ture of Roman antiquities existing in that interesting place. The process of the investigation which led Professor Braun to his valuable presumption of the spurious nature of these industrial products is to be found detailed in the 2Sd volume of the Tramsactio of the Societyj ofA] nt7§.aries iss zeinZand ; and a full account of the subsequent investigation,, corroborative of that presumption, will, I am told, shortly appear. There will be a very considerable and valuable collection of pictures put up to auction in this town on the 25th inst., and, from the number and value of the works that will thus come under the hammer, the sale will necessarily last a full month. The main catalogue contains 749 pictures, hung on the walls of the various apartments, and a supplement to it shows 350 more supported on stands. The bulk of these belong to the older period of the Dutch and Flemish schools, and the prevailing style is genre, with a large number of cabinet paintings; among thema are specimens of GerhardDouw, the two Ostades,Wilhelm van Mieris, Jan Steen, Gabriel Metzu, &c.; among the landscapes are some by Hobbema, Ruysdael, Everdingen, Pynacker, Backhuysen, and others. The catalogue boasts the names of Rubens, Vandyke, and Paul Potter, and even includes a Velasquez, Albrechlt Durer, and Lukas Cranach, together with a few works by French masters. The collection haa this attraction for picture lovers, that it was brought together by a wealthy private man (a banker named Wolff) for his own gratification. Ample taste and knowledge of the subject guided him in his selection, and his purchases took place at a period when originals were not so difficult to be got at as now. Another attraction is, that a large number of the pictures, though. of considerable merit, are the works of utlknown masters, or at least the cognoscenti of Berlin have not been able to fix their parentage. The gallery is being broken up by the heirs of the deceased collector. TURKEY. (FROM OUj OWN COn O .) CONSTANTINOPLE, MAY 12. During this month of Ramazan, while the regular transaction of business at the Porte is almost completely suspended, another species of activityintrigue-prevails in Constantinople. The Turks, who meet after sunset to feast in each others houses, soured by a long day's abstinence, require a vent for their ill humour; this they find in criticism and intrigue against those who happen to be in power. Plans are laid for their overthrow, combinations prepared to replace them, and such opportunities are afforded for following up an intrigue by the idleness of the time that generally it succeeds, and as the feast of Bairam is ushered in, so is another ministry called to power. It is now exactly six months since Redschid aaha came into office; his predecessors had so thoroughly mismanaged the affairs of the country, and by their duplicity in the Bessarabian boundary question so nigh embarrassed the negotiations at the second meeting of the Paris Conference, that for a time all opposition to Redschid was cast in the shade. But six months is a long time in Constantinople for a Minister to reign unopposed; the difficulties he must contend with are so great, even when his power is rendered absolute by the Sultan's unlimited support, that he must fail in a number of his plans, and thus give arms to his enemies against him. Redschid Pasha came into office pledged to carry out a number of reforms and improvements. The entire administration of the empire 'was to be remodelled, one province, Khodavenghiar or Broussa, being selected for the application on a small scale of the new principles of government, which were to be determined by a special commission. This commission has long since reported, but many useful innovations are not to be expectedfrom it, asthe opinion held in this comnmission is that everything is already perfect in Turkish institutions, and that nothing can be gained by deviating from the immutable laws of the Koran. Another promised reform concerns the Christian population. The Christians in Turkey, after having satisfied the fiscal agents and collectors of taxes, have still to meet the exigencies of a rapacious clergy. There is no limit to the exactions of the clergy; they screw out of every one what they can, and morein proportion from the poor than from the rich, as therich can more effectually resist execution than the poor. The :Ratti-Humayoun promises to fix the salary of every church functionary high or low, to establish a mode of collection of the revenue of the churches, and to appoint responsible committees to administer it; the high clergy and the Patriarch of the Greek Church have hitherto successfully resisted an innovation which would put an end to their ill-gotten gains, and as long as the patriarchal throne is flled by its present incompetent and unworthy oceipant there is little chance of its being carried. I shall again refer to this subject shortly. The necessity of a national bank in Turkey, as the foundation of every attempt at financial reform, has long been obvious to every one. Immediately after his appointment to office Redichid Pasha resumed the negotiations for this object which had been commenced by his predecessors. Several companies were then offering to meet any reasonable requirements of the Turkish Government. Unfortunately, the parties to whom a preference was given have not fulfilled their engagements, and by an absurdity in the wording of the convention they are liable to no penalty, although they have kept in suspense for many months all the trade of Turkey, and have brought heavy losses on all those-and they are many-who, believing in the realization of a signed contract, had operated in the expectation of a fall in the price of the exchange on Europe. The establishment of a bank in Turkey now appears as remote a contingency as the execution of the numerous lines of railway recently conceded, and of which the firmans are snugly lodged in the Ottoman embassy in London. Six months have thus passed away, and as yet none of the expectations awakened by the formation of a liberal Ministry, supposed to be in some degree guided by British influence, have been realized. It is not, therefore, astonishina that all the enemies of Redschid Pasha should feei'encouraged and lift up their heads again and predict his downfall for the approaching Bairam. Active intrigues are on foot to bring this about, and the unhappy issue of the Bank scheme gives considerable strength to them. The Sultan is disappointed in his hope of obtaining through it an unlimited supply of money, of which he is in great want at present, and he may sacrificeRedschid if his adversaries are clever enough to persuade him that they will procure for him this all-needful commodity. But no greater calamity could at present befall Turkey than a change of Ministry. Redschid is the only man who brings into office honesty of purpose. ~Unfortunately, he is weak, and gives his confidence too easily sometimes to unwrorthy flatterers, and this is the reason why he so often fails in the execution of well-conceived plans. :EUISSIA.

(moM oUR oVw conZPOND.) TURIN, MAY 16. It has been positively decided by the Sardinian Government to send a representative to Bologna to compliment His Holiness the Pope on his arrival there, which is expected to take place about the 21st of this month. The person selected for this duty is the Cavaliere Boncompagni, the Sardinian Minister at the Courts of Florence, Modena, and Parma. A few days ago he was suddenly summoned from his post in order to receive personal instructions for this delicate mission from his Sovereign and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and he is now on the point of returning to Florence, whence he will immediately repair to Bologna. I understand the French Minister at Florence, the Prince de la Tour d'Auvergne, has also received instructions from his Government to proceed to Bologna for a similar purpose. For several reasons the arrival of Es Holiness at Bologna is regarded as the most interesting point of the Pontifical progress. As the chief town of the Legations it has been selected as the place for foreign Governments to send their representatives to compliment the Pope, and it is probable that he will there receive visits from the Sovereigns of the jneighbouring States, while at the same time it is well knowii that it is at Bologna His Holiness will have the best opportunity of learning the causes of discontent which prevails in that portion of his dominions, and it is during his sojourn there he may, if ever, decree such reforms as would be consistent with the just demands of his loyal, though dissatisfied, subjects. The nomination of a representative (by the Sardinian Government) to compliment the Pope on his journey through the Legations is of course unpopular with the most advanced parties in Piedmont, who see in it an evidence of treachery on the part of their Mtinisters, and an intention to sacrifice the independence of the Crown and State to their own convenience. The nomlination finds no more favour with the clerical party, unfortunately, as the representative chosen is the person who proposed in Piedmont the infamous design of the law on civil marriage, they say, but moderate men are well contented with the resolution come to by their Government on this subject, feeling convinced that it is merely prompted by. a feeling of what is due in courtesy and etiquette from one Italian Court to another, and betrays no intention of sacrificing the civil power to the head of the church. 'Whether the friendly feeling evinced by the Sardinian Government in thus sending a representative to compliment His Holiness will be received and reciprocated in the same neighbourly good. spirit remains to be seen. If it should lead only to some accommodation regarding the now sequestrated sees of Turin and Cagliari, it will be a decided advantage for the'interests of the church in this country, but it is certainly very much to the credit of the Sardinian Government that it has again resolved on manifesting its kindly dispositions towards the Court of Rome, and I am sure that if it is met in the same Christianlike charitable spirit, there is nothing it would not do, short of sacrificing its own independence, to secure a perfect reconciliation with the Holy See. The crowds collected in the Piedmontese capital by the Festa of the StatutD have hardly separated when we are again threatened with a similar influx of strangers for the entertainments to be offered to the Empress Dowager of Russia, who is expected in Turin on- a visit to His Mlajesty Victor Emmanuel at the beginning of next week. Her Majesty is to remain here about four or five days, it is said, and during that time will be visited by the King of Saxony, who is now, or is imrediately expected, at Stresa, on the Lago Maggiore, where his daughter, the Duchess of Genoa, is at present residing. The subject which naturally attracts most attention in this country at present, both of statesmen and merchants, is the fate of the silkworms. As yet it is too early to form any decided opinion as to the results of this most important crop. So much depends on the weather and other accidental circumstances, that a few days of unpropitious cold or heat-somne malady in the seed, or some defect in the mulberry leaves-may entirely destroy the best founded hopes of a good harvest. Within the last few days, however, there has been a sensible improvement throughout the north of Italy, and from the south, where the worms are much more advanced, thelatest accounts are highly satisfactory. In Piedmont the hatching of the worms has been very general, and is so far considered very good. Some failures there have been, but the greater part is healthy, and I am assured that in consequence of the failure last year so much seed has been brought into the country this season from different parts of the rKworld-from China, India, South America, Syria, France, Spain, &c.-that if only one-third succeeds there will be worms enough to produce an average crop. It is for the mulberry trees that fears are principally expressed, and the accounts of these from different parts of the country are extremely conflicting. At Pinerolo, for instunce, the leaves are dried up and covered with a kind of moss. At Cuneo they are behindhand, and show suffering, from which they may get better perhaps as they advance, but that is a point on which no one can speculate. They are no better, though more plentiful, in the Lomellina and Novara, and the accounts from Lombardy show much the same state of things. The hatchinr had been somewhat premature in the districts of bomo, Bergamo, and Brescia, where the worms have already arrived at their third stage, and the farmers were embarrassed for want of leaves. Tn the province of Mantua the Ferrara seed had failed, and in the Friuli the season had been most inclement. As I have said, it is too soon yet to form a correct judgment of the forthcoming crop, but there appears good grounds for surmising that it will not, at all events, be very abundant. For this conclusion two very cogent reasons are adduced. In the first place, there is no doubt that there is some disease both in the seed and in the mulberry leaves in certain districts, and, in the second, the cold has in most places so retarded the whole processl that the spinning must in all probability occur during the great heat of summer, which is always detrimental to both quantity and quality, I believe. The Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Trades at Mlilan has elected an agricultural commission, forthe purpose of making the minutest inquiry as to the cause of failures, and to report fully on the different phases of all operations. This is an example which would be worthy of imitation in othes parts of Europe, so that both scieLntific and practical men might have the advantage of coraparing notes at the end of the season.

Bank Stock left off at 212to 214; Reduced, 92i to I; New Three per Cents., 92a to i; India Stock, 220 to 222; Exchequer Bonds, 982 to J; India Bonds) 8s. to 4s. discount; and iExchequer-biUls, June, Is. to 4s. premium; March, 4s. to 6s. premium. The rate for advances on Government securities in the Stock-Exchange ranged between 6 and 6i per cent., and in the discount-market there was again rather more ease. The applications at the Bank, where heavy repayments it is known are to be made at the end of this week, are supposed to have been rather numerous, although there was no actual pressure. Foreign securities opened with heaviness, and were particularly depressed during the middle of the day. Subsequently there was a slight recovery, with an increased disposition on the part of the dealers to purchase. Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, were negotiated at 941, 3, i, and J; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for money, at 100I and 101I; and, for the account, at 100I and 1. The other transactions comprised-Mexican, for the account, 22g and J; Portuguese Three per Cents., for money, 45k and 4; and for the account, 46; Russian Four-and-a-El per Cents., 96X; Sardinian Fivel per Cents., for the account, 914. Spanish Three per Cents., for the account, 414; and the New Deferred, for account, 25i to J. This being Ascension-day, there have been no transactions on the Paris Bourse. The continental exchanges continue to present at aU points a satisfactory appearance. It is stated from Panama that Her Majesty's sloop of war Alarm is expected at that port at the end of the present month or the beginning of June, with between $1,500,000 and $1,800,000 in silver from MIazatlan. The gold at present in course of remittance from Russia will, it is believed, go to Paris. Strong doubts of the correctness of the recent report of the Bank of France having entered into a new contract for the purchase of gold to the extent of 1,000,0001. are expressed in the private letters from Paris. It is stated that the bank have stiU to receive 600,0001, in completion of the old contract, and that there is no ground to suppose they would make a new one until the termination of the old one, especialy as their stock of bullion is now increasing. It appears tnat legal steps have been taken for the pursuit of M. Charles Thurneyssen, who is supposed to have eailed by the Arabia from Liverpool on Saturday, and that his surrender wiU be applied for under the Extradition Treaty between France and the United. States. Meanwhile his friends both in Paris and London, and also those who are connected with thea Crddit Mobilier are endeavouring to create an impression that the amount of his defalcations has been greatly exaggerated. There is no reason, however, to suppose that such is the case. Statements from the most reliable sources seem to concur upon the point, and even if nothing definite were ascertained it would be idle to presume that a person of such connexions in the speculative world would have been suffered to break down for a small sum under circumstances involving so much public damage. The names of the principal sufferers and the extent of their loss in each case seem to be currently known, and it is affirmed, moreover, that the system of misappropriation has been carried on for a longtime. In the existing state of affairs at Paris a speculator possessed of an eminent name, and enjoying the favour of the distinguished operators who have taken upon themselves to control and regulate the financial genius of the country, is not likely to have committed himself to a career ending in a compulsory flight for the moderate amount that in some quarters is now alleged to be the limit of the responsibilities of M. Thurneyssen. When the failure of M. Place for 800,0001. occurred last year there was a similar disposition to conceal the scope of the disaster. General silence on the part of the press, the combined efforts of all the speculators to deceive themselves and others, and the natural anxiety on the part of the victims to co-operate in keeping the public unacquainted with their entire or partial ruin, all assist in such cases to render the task of suppression practicable. In the present case, even if the law should ultimately reach the defaulter, the real magnitude and character of his acts will perhaps nevertranspiie. AUl that can be done, therefore, is to give the statements obtained from persons who are in the best position to form an opinion, and to test themby their inherent probability as compared with those which proceed from other sources. The accounts of the progress of the silk crop do not vary from those previously received. According to letters from Valencia, dated the 15th of Mlay, the Spanish yield was still expected to be about half an average, which is a great improvement upon last year. The worms were generally In their fourth stage. Regarding the French crop, Lyonsadvices of the 19th state that the worms were between the second and third stage, and that their progress was good. The mulberry-leaf, it is added, is magnificent, and the fact is also mentioned that the quantity of eggs put to hatch this season is double that of last year. From Broussa, in Asia Minor, where the cultivation is increasing, the latest accounts say that everything was going on well. Specie is at present in great demand for Turin, where the requirements are usually large at this time of the year in preparation for the reeling of the silk crop in Lombardy. The failure was announced to-day of Messrs. M3Alpin and lNephew, warehousemen. Their liabilities are supposed to be small. The Princess Royal has arrived from China with 675,600 lb. of tea and 519 bales of siLk. The East India Company have issued tenders for the conveyance of about 6,000 troops to Calcutta, &c., and it is thought that from 18 to 20 vessels will be taken up. At the annual meeting of the Provincial Bank of Ireland held to-day, Mr. 0. Farrer presiding, the dividend declared was 4 per cent. for the half-year with a bonus of 6 per cent. free from income-tax, and the report and accounts were unanimously adopted. The whole of the discussion was congratulatory, and it was stated that the profits continue to increase. Annexed. is an abstract of the report:- " The directorshave to report thatthe pastyear has been a peculiarly favourable one, and altogether satisfactory in its results. They are glad also to state that the condition of Ireland continues to improve. The harvest of last year in that country was, on the whole, good, the wheat crop being productive and of superior uality, and the oat and other grain crops, though injured by wet, quite equal to averago years. T he potato crop was large and of fine quality, and -lax was a fair crop, though in somO districts it was said to be rather coarse and variable in quality. The price of agricultural produce and of cattle has continued higb, and while those interested in land have been thereby benefited, the trade of the country has been in a sound and satisfactory condition. It was stated in last years report that two new branches had been recently establishod at Nenagh and Templemore, in the northern division of the county of Tipperary; and baving subsequently been solicited to open a new branch in the town of Carrioc-on.Suir, in the southern division of the same ounty, the directors after the usual inquiry, were induced to omply with the request, aud the branchwas accordin ly opened for busines3 on the 22d of December last. BeCore submitting the re. sults of the business of the past year, the directors think it right to refer to the unusual course they adopted in pying a second bonus along with the dividend at Christmas last. It was then seen that the profits of the year ending the 28th of 2darch, 1S67, were likely to exceed those of the preceding S arj and to admit ofa extra bonus bvsg puddto tho pro. o pretors, and the Court of Directorgtherefore th t; 'would bo expedtent to pay thXt bonus aleDgwt the Chrst ma-dividend in January, i3sterA of waiting until aftrthbi neetitg, and payi]g the additiotial bonus in July *ext, an&: the; expect that the shareholderx wil oncur in that f;ie, a apprOve the coureo adopted.

BAILWAY ZRTELLIGENOE. AuTWERP ANTi PnRAPiZDnAsr lte aunual report of the directors of this company states that the receipts for the year 1856 amounted to 40,681g., againSt 35,6561. in 1855, show in an increase of 5,025!. The increase in the passenger traffic amounted to 2,774., or about 12 per cent., and in the goods traffio to 2,6171., or about 45 ner cent., over the preceding year; but there was a decrease in the cattle traffic, the number exported from Holland in 1S56 having been much less than in 1855. The receipts for the firs threo months of 1857 show an increSase in the passenger traffic of 12 per cent., and in the goods traffic of 60 per cent. The working expenses, maintenance, and renewals, both for the railway and steamboats, amounted in the year 1S56 to 28,221L, and in 1855 to 26,3291., showing an increase of 1,89U. in the expenses, while there was an increase in the receipts of 5,0251. The worling expenses in 1855 amounted to 74 per cent. of the receipts, and In 1856 to 60 per cent. The outlay on capital account had been limited to the completion of works at lMoerdvke and of those required by the authorities at the Breda station, the establishmont of an electric telegraph, the planting of hedges, and the purchase of a piece o land at Mloerdyke, and some tools for the workshops at Antwerp. It was eopected that the receipts would be increased by the coal traffic to Moerdyke. Contracts had been entered into with coal mining companies to have de ots at that station, and, considering the prices at which they would sell the coals, the directors felt assured that the traffic fromn that source would be considerable. The completion of the line from Flushing to Venlo would extend the line on the one hand towards Flnshing, and on the other to Tilbourg, Bois-le-Duc, and the German lnes, and greatly contribute to Improve the traffic. The works which it was necessary to execute in accordance with the concession had absorbed a portion of the profits realized by the working of the line during the past year. tUnder these circumstances a dividend could not be paid without having recourse to a loan, which would bo uclt to obtain, because, in order to do so legally, the statutes would have to be altered, and the bonds already issued would still have the preference under the statutes.

Mr. FR oy reported from the committee that the object of the Bill was simply to enable the company to raise additional capitaL The committee had examined the allegations contained in the preamble of the Bill, and amended the same by adding a recital that the company had no preference shares, in order more clearly to describe the financial state of the company, and had found the same, as amended, to he true.

LAW REPORT. ADMRALTvY COTTPW'P L- 01 M TiLE DV}UCESS DE RRrARA_A 1A flT.- - (Before Dr. I:usmNToo,)' -- Thls was a suit promoted by the brig Jason against the bark Duchesse de Bzabant to recover the loss arising from a collision between them, at 12.30 p.m. on the 1st of March last, about 20 miles off the Lizard-Light. The learned JUDGE. having called on the counsel for the bark to address the Court in the first instance, Dr. JBNMC said that, the Court and the Elder Brethren having read the papers, he would submit to any sentence that might be pronouncad. The COURT pronounced ainst the balr. THE ALRXANDRB-COLLMIoT. This wae an action brought by the sloop Asp, of the burden of 38 tons, against the brig Alexandre, of the burden of 164 tons, to obtain compensation for the damage arisng from a collision between them about ibx miles from the Dudgeon Lightship at 2 p.m. on the 18th of January last. The sloop, in ballast, was proceeding from Jersey to Montrose; the brig, coal.laden, was bound from Newcastle to Alexandria. The sloop, as she stated, was close hauled on the lboard tack when she observed the brig running free about a point and a-half on her starboard bow distant half-a-mfle. The brig, insteaa of keeping her course, auddenly luifed up when close on the sloop and struck her a violent blow. The brig, on the other- hand, alleged that she was close hauled on the starboard tack, and that the sloop was running free. The sloop proceded without altering hec e, and the brig, in order to avoid the collsisonput her ard aport, but the sloop then starboardeao ther helm, in consequence of which thu fvesels came into violent contact. Dr. her and Dr. Dth l were hearll for the sloop; Dr. RoaiaNsoN and Dr. SPtNhs for the brg s The learned JimGa said, the Elder iaorethren were of o.pii. h the wind was free for both vessels that the sloop was to blame for not havthg ported, and the brig was to blamne for not having ported in time. Both vesIsels were in fault. Decree awcoraingly. THE DAflljA.-SALVAGX. This wasait promoted byiacompany ofvoatmen belang. ing to Lovestof, against the schooner Dahlia to procure salvage remuneration for services rendered to her on the 5th of December last on the Newcombo Sbad. The schooner laden wita pig lead, was bound from seville to :Newcaie. The salvors, as they represented. fonding it impossible to conduct the ve el into iwesoft harbour, ran hier on shore near the lower lighthouse, andathen entered into an agreement to land the stores and bargo and securely warehouase them, and et the schooner into the harbourafor 3001. It was afterward found necessary to lay a false deck in order to float the schooner, and the agent for the owners inquired of the alvors what they would pay towards the expenses, but they declined to have anything to do with it. The agent then entered into a contract with a shipwright for the false deck, and the schooner, havin en got off the bmeah, was towed by a steasutug into the harbour. On the part of the owners, it was contended that the salvors had, in the first instance, forced themselves on board the schooner and taken possession of her against the reioonstrances of the master, hut, there being no other assstance which could be procured, the agreement in question ws subsequently entered into. The salvors, in reply, averred that they were hailed to board the schooner, and were gassiste in doing so by oe throw into their boat, The. owners made atender of 2'21, deducting from the agreement 981., the expense of the false deck. The value of the property salve was 1,2501 Dr. ROnn{soy and Dr. JxaNrgs were heard for the salvors; Dr. ADDAmS andaDr. Twiss for the owners. The learned JUDGE was of opinionx that the salvors were bound to pay for the false deck, ittbin~ one of the appliancees necessary in order to get the schooner 2nto the harbour, and, had the case rested there, he would have pronounced for the tender with costs. There were, however, anterior' services, for which he would award them 1001., with costs,
COU1AT OP BANVKRUPTOY, Basighai-str eet, AMay 2L IN RE m;rPuwpn A -z C (Before Mo.. V-. - % T'he bankrnpts wero lozenge-manufacturers, of Crane. court, Feet-sreet. This was the examination meeting Lr. I1Kr-ThR said. an offer of gs. in the pound was being made to the creditors, which his client declined to accept. The CoamssIoNR observed that the bankrupts had been trifing with the Court. Their case had been before the Court three months. No accounts, however, had yet been filed. It was an easy mode to tbecome bankrupt to come here and compel creditors to take what bankrupts liked. There must be an adjournment sine die. Mr. CIIDLEY, for the bankrupts, suggested that an adjournment to a fixed day, at the bankrupts' own expense, would meet the requirements of the case. Hlis HoxouRuconcurred. Protection would not,however, be extended beyond that day. Adjournment accordingly. IN RE J. NORTON5. The bankrupt was a hop and malt-merchant, of Norwich. Tis was the examination meeting. Mr. LUCAS supported; Mr. BAGLEY opposed. The bankrapt's accounts were alleged to be unvouched to the extent of 4,0001. out of 6,0001. The Comm=oNER, held that the accounts were unvouched to a large amount. The question seriously arose what was to be one in such cases? The other day he refusedtopass a bankrupt on similar accounts On an appeal, however, to the Lords Justices, they in half an hour made themselves acquainted with the accounts, and passed the bankrupt's examination. In this case he was not satisfied, neither were the assignees, who, being conversant with the minutim of the bankiupt's business, possessed peculiar means of judging of the accuracy of his accounts. It was said that better accounts could not be furnished. That might be so, but blank sheets of paper might as well be placoed before him as those now furmsheE. The as2ignees obetn, he should adjourn theubanskreupt's Texaminatnion sine die. In the event of the Superior Court passing the bankrupt upon such accounts he hoped it would say why, b)ecause in such a case he did not see the use of people c-oming here to object to accounts. Adjournment sine die accordingly. IN RE SWORDER. The bankrupt was a maltater, of Ware. Hiis Hoxous gave judgment on the question of certficate. The hookkee;ping bad been had and the trading careless. T'he justice of the case would be met by suspending te certificate (second class) one year, with protection. (Before Mr. Commwisioner FONBLANQUE). IN RE HENRY AUGUSTUS HOPE. The bankrupt was a hay-salesman, of 60, West-street, West Smithfield. His debts are 2,2401., assets about 2001. This was the certificate meeting. Mr. Norton appeared for the assignees; Mr. Linklater M;S Hoy.ouB suspended the certificate (third class) six months from the examination meeting, observing that the trade expenditure had been excessive.
INSOLV.ENT DEBTORS' GOURT Jay 2L _ m IL RE J. IV. TrTrmqAk N' (Before the CITTP1.' P flA rCT i :.nrs imsolvent petitioned under the Protection Act. Mr. CAARTEFa opposed on behalf of a butcher named Worley, and asked that some part Of the insolvent's pension should be set aside for the benefit of the creiditors. Mr. SARGOOD U&Pported. It appeared that the insolvent was formerly the Governnent agent at Ceylon, which colony he quitted in 1842, and had since been in receipt of a pension of 4001. a-year, which be had oharged with an advance of 4001. from a Mr. Knight. ais debts were 2911., which he declared himself anxous to pay, but, having a family of six persons to maintain, he could not at present make any proposal Mr. SARGOOD, on behalf of the insolvent, said, no doubt there must be some proposa filed, but would leave it to the Court to decide what the amount should be. A day was eventually named for the final order, and the question of&the proposal was allowed to stand over until the next occasion. (Before Mr. Coinmiasiosner PnLULps.) IN RE WILLIA2 G(TSO.;N. This insolvent, a shoemaker in Rted Lion-street, had been before the Court on several former occasions. H[e was opposed by Mr. Bruton, the vocalist (upon this occasion represented by MT.

After the money had been paid the insolvent went away without handing over the e~ase, and upon being subsequently sought out by Mr.. Bruton, and pressed for the security, ho gave him the lease of a. nousel in Southampton-buildings, of which the ground-rent was 601., and which proved to be of little value, as Mir. Bruton had only been able to get about 151. or 20i from the tenants, and the'house had since been taken possession of by the ground landlord, for a breach of the covenants of the lease. Mr. Commissdoner PHILLIPs was of opinion that a fraud had been practised upon Mr. Brnton, and ordered that the insolvent's discharge from that gentleman's suit should not issue until the expiration of six calendar months from the

(Before Mr. Undorn.q mnf 1t- tnLs was a wnt o0r quiry to assess the damages in an action brought to recover for injury done to the plaintaff 'by the defendant having thrust a piece of red-bot glass into her eye. The damages were hid in the declarat.on at SOOZ. Mr. Morgan (Humphrey, Son, and Morgan) appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Metcalfe, barrister, for the defendaat. This was a very distressing case, and it called forth the sympathy and commiseration of every person in court. The plaintiff was a girl under 14 years of age, who sued by her next friend, and the defendant, James Clifford, was a young man about 21 years of age, a glass-blower in br'slness on his own account at No. 5, Greville-street, Hatton- arden. In September last he was an apprentice to Air. Negretti, of Dorrington-street, *ad on the 20th of that month, as the plaintiff was peeping through the shutter screw-hole in the woodwork of the window, the defendant thruot a piece of red-hot glass through the hole. It penetrated her left eye, the sight of 'which it entirely destroyed, and as at the age of six months she lost the dg of the other eye she was rendered totally blind for life. It appeared that some boys had been playing the mischievous trick of puffing tobacco-smoke through the hole, and it was urged that the defendant, thinking it was oile of them looeing through the hele, foolishly and indiscreeUt put the piece of glass through, not intending to do any Ju]ry, but there wvas a square of glass immediately over the hole, and he could have6seen it was a girl, and not one of the boys, although, as a juryman remarked, the ac would have been .oet as bad even had o~ been one of the °ffendefentboys. he-,ds mother was a wvidow, -living gat sm- apoll ioourt. mFe,tbstreet, pVhere sheerne e d a re-iou qfliving bynedework, and at the time of thu b occurrene tshe p n<tiff had aplc coat 9d. per week and food to take care of a baby, atid since the mother -been unable toleavoher, As she cziod if she even quitted-herfor .o ment, On the day it oourred she was out witht.he child, and her mistes told her to sit down on a Ste but, seeing the bopvs " larldng" in front of the window, shle went to see 'what it was about, when she looked through the hole, and instantly the glass was pushed into her eye.

The case was then gone into at considerable length and the claims of the house for a license were very ably set forth. Ultimately the license was refused by nine votes to eight.

POLICE. MANSION-HOUSE.-Samuel Wright and Mary Donovan charged with having stolen a great number of sacks, the property of JIr. Janlmeson, sack merchant, of Bishopsgate. street, and Samuel Thorn, John Bradley, and James Downing, charged with having received the samo knovrinz that they had been stolen, were brought up for final examination. There was a remarkable circumstance connected with this case, which has been several times under examination before the Lord Mayor. James Downing, charged as one of the receivers, had been called and examined as a witness when the statemen' was first made before the Lord Mayor, and, after he gave his testimony, he was transferred from the witness-box to the prisoner's dock, and Bradley, who had been at the commencement placed in the prisoner's dock, was removed from that disagreeable position to the witness-box and aramined as a witness. In the course of the very long and searching inquiry before the Lord Mayor it was stated by Mr. Denny, one of the witnesses for the prosecution, that he had known and done business with Bradley for severalyears, and always considered him to be a man of unimpeachable integrity. The following contains the essentil point of the evidence of Bradley :-I live at No. 23, Oxfordstreet, Whitechapel, and am a corn, Slour, sack, and ship store dealer. On the 29th of April I sold to Mr. Tatton 200 new sacks-viz., 100 four-bushel sacks, at ls. 2d. a sack, and 100 five-bushel sacks, at Is. 6d. a sack. I bought them of the prisoner Downing. I gave Is 4d. a sack for the fivebushel sacks, and Is. ld. a sack for the four-bushel sacks. I sold them on my own account. I also sold to Mr. Ower 60 other sacks, which I had bought of l)owning at Is. ld., for Is. 2d. a sack. I did not tell the officer, that I am aware of, that I sold the sacks by commission. I have bought tbree or four lots of sacks from Downing, and I paid him ready money. I have bought 500 or 600 new sacks from him. I thought when I bought them that he asked enough, and I did not consider that there would be much profit for me. I never had reason to think that he came dishonestly by them. He did not say where he got them from." Wright and Donovan were then committed for trial as the thieves, and Thorn and Downing were committed as the receivers, but allowed to put in bail, and Bradley was bound over, together with the other witnesses for the prosecution, to give evidence. Bow-s lr.-.-Edward Thomas, a middle-aged man, who said he was a ragpicker and boneseller, was charged with an indecent assault upon a little girl named Mary Ann BagneDll, only seven years of age, the daughter of a tailor living in the NTew Turnstile. lIolborn. Mr. HxRntY, after conferring with the child's mother, decided on dealing with the prisoner by summary convicton, and sentenced him to sixc months' hard labour. Ir. Stride, the keeper of two opera " ticket-offices" adjoining the Lyceum Theatre, having written to complain that his business reputation may suffer from our report of Wednlesday, it iS but fair to state that his was not the office referred tO, but one in the Strand, adjoining the pit entrance. M&ARLnoROUG}I-sTREa.-Mfred Bartlett, a young man of smal stature and forbidding aspect, was charged with having attempted to murder his grandmother, an old lady 70 years of age, named Restall, living at Charlton, near Strood, and with having robbed the house. The prisoner, on Sunday. left his wife at No. 1, Archerstreet, and went down to Charlton. About the evening of Monday it Is believed that he reached Charlton, and, findin the old woman in bed, he roused her up and was let into the house, and supper provided for him. With the knife supplied to him to eat his supper with he intended, it is presumed, to cut the old woman's throat, but from some cause, which has not yet been ascertained, he did not succeed in his p=pse. On Teaday imorning the old woman wafound in her om in a fri htful state. Her skull was fractured and shoekingly bruised. One of her ears was cut in two, her back was one mass of bruises, and one of her fingeru was smuashed. It is conjectured that this injury to the fingers was the means of saving the old woman's life by breaking the force of the blows aimed at the head. Tbe injuries had been inflicted with a heavy poker which the prisoner muat have taken upstbira with him at the sae time that he tookthe knife. The hose adbeen a_ ed and a quantity of portable articles had evidently been uake away. The old woman, though so dreadfully injured, was not dead,- and medical assistance was imnediately sum. moned. From erWin information that Wa obtained the prisoner wa suspected, and ielegraphic mesages were sent to different parts and to London, where the Pri*quer Wa known to have taken lodagngs recently with his wife. LASt night the po ce were on tbe look-cut for the priso!ter, and about 9 o'eclock Polioe-oonstable James, C 157 saooweded in taking the prsoner into custody in AZcZer-street. When the constable bid hold of the prisoner he noticed that the prisoner triedtoputhishandintohiapocket. He called to aconstablo to ley hold of the prisoner's hand, and on searching his pocket found a razor, with which the prisoner evidently intended in case of eapture to attempt bhi ov life or the life of any one who should seize him. On searching the Frsoner's lodging a trunk full of miscellaneous property was load, and, as the prisoner had for a short time been employed as a waiter at the Manchester Art 1xhibition, it ws conjectured that part of this property had been stolen from the Exhibition. No time was lost in telegraphing to Manchester, but the reply had not arrived when the court closed. In the prisoner's possession were some duplicates which re supposed to relat to property stolen from Mrs. Betall's house. The latest information states that the old lady may possibly survive the vicleneeahe has sustained, but thI ti etdoubtfuL, The prisoner has been alwrays very w rae y his grandmother; and this rmenders the crime the more atrocious. Tbeprisonerwasaformally remanded, nd will be seat either to Manchester or Strood writhout delay. WORSICEP.8TRIr.-About a week ago the wife of a l1bouring mn named Racklf applied to Mr. D'EYi. COURT for a warrant against her husband for assaulting her. The woman's chin was envelopd in a wrapper she said she was without food and afrai to go home, ahl the magistrate not only granted the warraut for the man's apprehension, but supplied the woman With money to keep herslf meantime. Next day, on seeing her husband in the dock, the wife became much affected, and displayed such. uuwil2gness to sy anything wnthim that the magit. trate was obged to remind hero her application, and it was only withgreatdifficultythof of the assaultcould be got from her. She said, on the Friday before the prsoner, on going out, had ordered her to Rut his boots to the fire that they might be mended; she ad so; and, on his coming home in the evening, he desired her to take themx to the mender's. She had been ill all day-as, indeed, she had been ever since her confinement, four months previously -and therefore refused to take them, on which he abused her very much, and sbe, in retaliation, flung one of his boots into the fire. How long it remnained there she did not say or know, but she said he took the boot off the fire scorching hot, and held it to her face, she not being able to get away from the wall behind her, and that not only was her face burnt from her under-li p to beneath her chin, but that one of her eyes was slightly burnt also. She screamed "Murder' and ran into the street, the bot part of the leather sticking to her face, on seeing which some children who saw her soreamed, and some of her neighbour, who saw her state, -applied oil to the wounds, which were also kept in oil aU night, and gave her such Van that she hadbeenimnable to either.eat or lese. All this was given very reluctantly, interspersed witn deolarations that the blame was her OWn, and entreaties not to have him punished; and she slso stated that, though he had iUused her before, he wag a very industrious man, who never missed ada s work, gave her al his wages, andthat he was drunk at the time lo sO served her. A woman named Kempton also deacribed the wife's face as in a very bad state the next mornig, when she saw it. he prisoner declared it was all a peat exaggeration, that he was nerely throwing the hoot out of windo., when it accidentallystruck his wife, and that he had no wish what- Farll, the warrant officer, also deposed to making inquies into the matter, and that he found the husband to be an industrious hardworking man. Mr. D'Eyco therefore took thee circumstances into consideration. only sentencing thehusband to three months' imprisonment in the House of Correction; and Mr Burch, the resident medical officer of the London Hospital, now attended, and, drawing the magistrate's attention to the facts of the case, stted thet the wife had been admitted Into that institution, and that, from what bad since occurred, there was so much reaon to fear that the man might have been unjustly punished, that the authorities of the hospital had directed him to attend and lay the matter before the Court. The woman was much excited when she came to the hospital, had been ro ever since, and there could be no doubt that she was labouring under acute mania, The fear was that she might have been so before and at the time she charged her husband, and if so, and if there were anything wrong in the conviction, it was only proper the husband should have the benefit of it. M1r. D'ErxCOURT thought inquiries should be made. Something might be gleaned from the woman's neighbours as to her evincing previous symptoms of madness, and, if this should turn out to be the case, it might certainly lead to so much doubt as to justify a communication with the Home Secretary upon it. Mr. Burch said that was emactly the object of his interceitodn, and, thanking the magistrate for his attention, SoUTRWAJIL-Jane French, rather a good-looldng young girl, was brought before Mr. ComSB, charged with atealing a cambric handkerchief, a present from Miss Nightingae, in the Crimea, and a lace collar, beaides other articles of wearmg aprel, theoropertn of her master, Henry Wyld, photograp tc artist, No. 58, Blackfriars.road. The prosecutor said that about a month ago he took the prisoner into his servicethrough charity7toassistincovering the portrait cases. During that time he missed several artic es, but had no suspicion as to the prisoner until a few days ago, when she absconded. Amongthe things he missed was a cambric handkerchief, given to his brother by Miss Nightingale, in the Hospital at Scutari, while attending to, hi3m ox a bed of sickness, and witness valued it, not for its intrinsic worth, but for the estimable lady who gave it. From information he received he proceeded to the lodgin of a young woman named Mildenhall, and there he founn the handkerchief and a lace collar which belonged to him and afterwards he saw the prisoner and gave her into Ann Mildenhall said that the prisoner came to her and told her she was in distress and had no home. Witness be. lieved she was a respectable young woman, took her in, and allowed her part of her bed. She afterwards handed to her the handkerchief prodnoed and the lace collar to keep for her. Mrs. Wyld identified the latter as her property; also some wearing apparel which the prisoner had on. She considered her a very ungrateful girl, as they took her into their service throagh charity, and, bad she remained, would have bettered her condition. Witness had lost several articles which had not been found. The prisoner said she did not think she was stealing the handkerchief and colar, as they were lying about the place, and as for anything else she had no knowledge of it. Mfr. Conxm told her that she had stolen the property produced, and he considered her conduct devoid of all gratitude for the kindness displayed towards her by Mr. and Mrs. Wyld. He should sentence her to three months' hard labour in the House of Correction. LABETI-The Hon. G. C. NORTON was again occupied for some time in further investigating the charge against John Herbert Taylor, alia8 Fish, James Sullivan, William Scaines, Henry Scaines, and Augustus Frederick Cordner, of being concerned in a burglary and extensive robbery at the house of Mr. Moran, a hosier in High-street, Newing ton. The burglary and robbery had been committed on the night of the 22d of last month, and on Friday week a great portion of the stolen property was found at it beershop in the Caledonian-road, kept by the prisoner William Scaines, and at the time the prisoners Sullivan and Fish who are notorious thieves and burglars, were discovered i;t bed there. Some portions of the property stolen was also found at the lodgings of Henry Scaines, as weeU as a clock that had been stolen but a few days before. The evidenee in the case of Mr. Moran was taken, and al the prisoners were committed to take their trials upOn it; Henry Scaines was further committed on a charge of stealing the clock; but all the prisoners will be brought up~ on a future day, to bo further examined on two additional charges, one for stealing a valuable flute and a corneta-piston, the produce of other robberies, and which, with the other propert;' and a variety of housebreaking implements, were found at the beerhouse of Williamt Scaines.

SAFEY UGSTODY OF ORIGINA L WILL S. TO ETE EDITOR OF TECH TIMES. Sir,-Among the evils of the testamentary ju2isdietion 'hitherto exorcised by the Ecclesiastical and Manorial Courts -have been-the multipEcity of registries where original wiUs are deposited, and the occasional inseeurity of their custody. It was to be hoped that the Lord Chancellor's Bill would have furnished a remedy for both these evils, and that it 'would have provided that all original wills should be I transmitted to the General Registry, whereby security of deposit would have been combined with convenience of reference. It is proposed, however, that copies only of the wills, of which probate is to be granted by the District Registrars, should be transmitted to London, while the originals are to remain in the custody of the District Regis. trars. This arrangement eems to be highly objectionable in prindple, and in practice it wiU be fraught with the greatest danger, as there is no provision whatever in the Bill for the constructioz of district registries. The BiU speaks, indeed, of " the Public Registry of the District," but its framners have entirely overlooked eaI provision for a building which shaU answer such a description. If, .however, there are to be 37 District Registrars, to whom a very large proportion of original wills will be confided, the public interest demands that as many -district registries should be constructed, dry, fireproof and 'readily accessible. A back room in the District Registrar's-office, liable to fire and exposed to spoliation, would prove but a sorry substitute for the existing diocesan registries -which the cathedrals supply, and which although sometimes -damp are always secure from robbery and fire. The con.Etruetion of 37 district registries will, it must be -admitted, entaUi a heavy charge unon the State, but the alternative would be monstrous, unless, indeed, the principle which is applied in the 84th clause to all past wils should be extended to all future wills. There seems to be no good reason why aU original -wifls should not be transmitted to the General Registry, while the copies should be retained in the office of the District Registrar. There would also result from this arrangement an incidental advantage, that every original 'wi would pass under the eye of the principal Registrars in MoLandon. ________ A LAYMAN. May 21.
YM!i Din SFX IOSPITAL.-The annual distribution of prizes and honorary certificates to the medical students at this institution took place yesterday afternoon at the hospital; the Bishop of London took the ohair. After a brief report from Dr. Frere, which spoke of the pror made by the hospital during the pastyear as having been greater than during any previous months of its existence, the right rev. chairman awarded the following prizes and ,distinctions :-Medicino.-Prize, Mr. Jobn Tatlham * Certiflcate of Honour, Mr. D. Devereux. Sorgery.-Prize, Mr. John Tatbam; Certificates of Honour, Mr. D. Dovereux, Mr. J. W. Eaton, and Mr. S. Barker. General Anatomy and Physiology.-Prize, Mr. W. E. Rix; Certificates, Mr. R.

Prize in Morbid Anatomy and Histolog"., Mr. John Tathom; Clinical Prize in Medioine, Mr. John Tathom; Treasurer's Prize, Mr. John Tathom. A number of honorary certificates for general good conduct and diligence were then awarded to the most deserving pupils of the hospital, and the Bishop of London, after paying a high .compliment to Mr. John Tathom, who had carried off the greatest number of prizes and certificates, made a brief but most eloquent and feeling address to the students. ln the course of it he expressed his sincere hope that the efforts of those connected with the hospital to establish it as a collegiate institutfon for the study of medicine would ere long be crowned with success. Se rejoiced at the gratifying nature of the report which was made by the various professors of medicine as to the unvarying good conduct, attention, and industry of the students during the past year, and exhorted them to -contiue in the course whioh they had so well begun, ard add to the reputation of the hosDital, not only by their professional skill, but by the rectitude of their social and moral relations in life. Great as had been the benefits which the lhospital had conferred upon the eowumunity at large, it had effected none more important or likely to be more lasting in its results than in thus training up a body of educated and Christian gentlemen. He lioped and elieved that in the duties of their after life. they would one and all worthUy discharge themselves -of the great momal trust and responsibility which Providence ,had comiitted to their care. The proceedings, which were watched with much interest by a large nutmber of the friends and reflatives of the students, terminated with the j.sual vote of thanks to the right rev. chairman. ST. MARY" HOSPITAL MEDICAL SCHOoL.-On 'Wednesday various prizes and certificates of honour were Vresented to the students of this institution by Sir J. KaySbuttleworth, who delivered a very interesting and intellectual address upon the occasion, forming a sequel to one delivered by him At Manchester, aed published iu The 'Times some montho since. In this address a tribute was paid to the true dignity of the art of medicine, and the -speaker enlarged in a highly philosophical strain upon its moral relations. He remarked that there was an exquisite and complicated machinory before the student of anatomy. It was known that the machine stopped when certain vheels were broken, but it was not known why a drop of poison on an openz wound, or from the fang of a cobra cape33a, stoplped it in an in6tnt, though the same elements in a combination slightly altered nourished and refreshed. The addrees then referred to the functions of separate structures and the varied phenomena of life, giving elucidations upon each peculiar organ, the muscles, and tissues, and next touched upon the -organization of animals. Theohon. baronet, referrIug to the profession of medicine, said that one of the most xefining and elevating influences to which it was subject was the dependence of the mass -of the poor upon it for aid in the great crises and afflictions of life. Haziag spoken at great length upon the consolations anid advantages derivable from *the profession, he gave appropriate advice to the -students of the art, and, after remarling upon the evils -of intemperance, concluded Si an eloquent and impressive strain by expressing his coniction that onr moral eonsti. .tution was in such relation to the external world that we were invited hopef.lly to win "r way to mental and moral 1ife witha.promise of victory to all who etrived. At the conclusion of the address a vote of thanks was passed to Sir J. Kay-Shuttleworth, and a aequest was made that he would allow it to -be painted. Q(UEIDN CsARLoxr&E's LYrxc1 RosPlTAL.-Yes_ terday evening the anniversary festival of this charity was held at ;7ilBis* Rooms, [(in g-street, St. Jarnese; Mr. B. B. 4abbell, MI. P., in the chair, in the asence of Lord Londes'borough. Bir -C. Locock and several of the leading medical gentlemen of the mietropoks were present. From the report .of the society, whica was distributed atout the room, it appeared that, in spite of alsost insuperable difficulties, the ymew hospital had been zebuialt at a cost of 4,0001. The new 'building was well proDortioned, admirably ventilated, warmed by hot water apiaratzs, and capable of receiving 50 3?tients, though, in cousequeace of the 6malluess of the fands, the committee were elactantly compelled to imit the number to S0 in-patientz. 'ilme opening of the larger hospital neacessitated au increase of expenditare, which the cooimuittee earnestly hoped the aid of the benevolent would enable thetn to ineet. and render it one of the most effilcient, as it was already one of the most needed, charities in the metropolis. The usual formal toasts were given and duly honoured, and routine was departed from on this occasion by P roposing "The Memory of the late Duchess of Glocester,' as one who had subscribed to the charity for snore than 40 years, and who tbree days before her death had bequeathed a legacy of 201. The toast was of course drunk in eolemn kilence. " Prosperity to the Hospital" was received with vo' iferons applanse, and the chairman pointed out that the hospital admitted under its fostering caresingle women who claimed its sbelter for the lirit time. Subscriptions to the a tount of 'tPlt. were anno.unc-d during the ecourse of tIbe evening. The dinner was eseellent and the musical arrwgemen's 6e,o tho Utmost satiWaction.
SPOBTIfLG INTELLIGENCE. TATTERSALT'I TvnlpT- Important changes were again effected in the list of quo. tations on the Derby, and the tendency of speculation was rendered still more doubtful and perplexing by the move. ments relative to certain homres. Recently random shots have been fired at Skirmisher with little perceptible effect, and no attempt to drive him from his position has sueceeded. Since the York Spring Meeting he has been remarkably firm, and, indeed, he appeared to advance " under cover" of coming horses. Whatever new favourit," were brought into the marketb or whatever old ones v,ere driven out, Skirmisher was never superzeded, and the c,pera. tions yesterday imparted additional steadiness to IiS posi. tion. The first bet bookedoabout hina was 650 to ljo, afterwards 6 to 1 was taken to various amounts, tIte closing outlay being 1,800 to X0. Arsenal was shakea * 9 to 1 to 1004, and subsequently lO to 1 was betted, the latter odds being currently offered, "barone " M.D. meanwhile re. ceived more of a pasive thanv.n active support.

THE ROYAL HoSPITAL.-This institution beld its second anniversary dinner yesterday at the London Tavern, and was presided over by Mr. Charles Dickens, at whose suggestion the institution was founded in 1854. It was pointed out by him in HousAchd Words that, although there were hospitals for the cure of every possible ailment or disease, yet there was not one for the reception of persons past cure. On this hint a society was formed to provide for the permanent care and comfort of those who, by disease, acci ent, or deformity, are hopelessly disqualified for the duties of life. On the present occasion Mr. Charles Dickens presided, and was supported by the Marquis Townshend, Lord Alfred Paget, ALP., Viscount Raynham, the Hon. Edmund Phipps, Sir J. P. Boileau, Sir C. Smith, Mr. Sheriff Mechi, and many gentlemen of the medical profession. Mr. C. Dickens, in proposing " Prosperity to tho Royal Hospital," gave a most interesting account of a visit which he had recently made to the temporary hospital at Carshalton, and described in his own graphic style the calm and Christian-like resienation displayed by the inmates of the house. He said that among them all he beheld a tranquility of manner and a serenity of mind that perfectly amased him, considering that they were every one of them incurable. The building, however, was not, he said, what it ought to be; it required enlargement, and needed many appliances. He therefore strongly appealed to the company to contribute towards its support, considering, as he. did, that an in. stitution of this description was a naturalandnecessary adjunct to every hospital in the kingdom. Dr. Reed, the secretary, then read a list of subscriptions, which amounted in the aggregate to upwards of 1,2701. The dinner was served in the usual satisfactory manner of the London Tavern, and the musical department, under the direction of Mr. Ransford, contributed agreeably to the proceedings of the evening. Mr. Higgs discharged the duties of toastmaster. BrSuoGnApsrc CuRtrosrrs.-Two of the rarest specimens of xylographic or block books, cut entirely on wood, which were the precursors of printing by means of moveable types, have recently come into the possession of Messrs. Boone, of 19, New Bond-street. Of these the first in point of rarity is the Libor- Begum~, or "Life of David," pictorially ilustrated with two woodeuts on a page, with descriptive text beneath, and extending to 20 pages. So little is known of this work, printed about the year 1450, that it escaped Heinecken, who specially devoted his researches to the bistory of early printing. Brunet and Dibdin are alike meagre in details-in fact, but one other copy is known to exist, and that is in the Imp-rial Library at Vienna. The other is known as the Bibli4 Pauperum, of which facsimiles have been given. The copy in Messrs. Boone'spossession corresponds with the descrip- tion given by Heinecken as being of the firsb impression, a copy of which sold at Willett's sale for 245 guineas. Both these volumes are in matchless state, being uncoloured, not pasted back to back as is generally the case with similar books, as the Ar5 .fotiendi, Apocacylsis S. Johannis, &c., but the leaves are set, as in books of ordinry printing, with the reverses blank. The margins also are oi ample dimensions. BEATING PARISH BouNDs. - Yesterday being Ascension-day, or Holy Thursday, the incumbents of the metropolitan parishes, the churchwardens and other officials, assited by the charity boys, who, in most cases, were the nost attractive portions of the procession, in consequence of the zest with which they performed their part of the duty, went through the ceremony of beating the parochial bounds. The Templars took their usual precautions against an invasion of their extra-parochial rights, and fromx an early hour in the day their gates were closed, and carefully guarded against the Intrusion of the "parish," whose authority over them the legal gentlemen have hitherto successfully resisted. The rector of St. Dunstan's, with his faithful band of officials and boys, knocked at "the outer gates of the Temple" and requested admission, but the guards kept to their posts, and the legal citadel was im- regnable. The rector and his party retired, as they had done many times before, without effecting an entrance, and the Tomplars consequently still maintain their exemption from parochial rates. The same ceremony was gone through with precisely the same results at Lincoln's-inn and 'ray's-inn. In some of the outlying parishes the marking of the bounds only takes place septennially, and then a man is violentlyeaptured and humped againsta ost, in order to strengthen his memory in reference to hoss strict legal boundaries which it is considered desirable to maintaini. OPPOSrmON TO THE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS Bir.- It has already been stated in The Times that the boards of guardians of some of the large towns In Yorkshire were opposed to Mr. Adderley's Bill for the education of pauper and vagrant children. At the weekly meeting of the Waefzeld guardians on Taesday the chairman read a letter from Mr. (3harlesworth, MLP. forthat borough, stating that the Bill had been remodelled, and wishing to know whether the board were still opposed to it. The chairman then pointed outss a most objectionable feature in the Bill the clause which provides that any children who may be found begging, orcommittiny any act of vagrancy, should be sent to an1 industrial acihool at a charge of 3s. per week on the union until the child should be 15 eanrs of age, which was five years -longer thanh the periodl hat an 8hnest max could allow his childre to remainamt school, 10 years being the age at which ohildren of the working classes left school.

.RQUA7IZAT.IoN OF ITHB POORRATE& :'0 THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. i r,-T. have read with much interest tho letters that have fro"' =tAZo to tlme appeared in your columns on the eqtW"Atio)n of the poor-rate in the metropolis. rae easons urged by Mr. Bouverie in his interview Ath the deputation that waited on him a few days since 'and which wero so well eufarged on in your leading article of, I think, the following day, appear to me to be conclreive as against any plan for converting the metropolis iuto a single parish for Poor Law puroses. I address this letter in answer to tho very perti3nt question with which you conclude your article:-" Can nothing be done in such a case?" Tho pressure of the poor-rates on real property in certain parishes in the eastern part of the metropolis is not of recent date. So long ago as the year 1800 a committee of 43 members of the 4lite of the House of Commons, comprising the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Pitt) and most of the leading statesmen of the day, sat to conEider by what mes the pressure on certain petitioni ng parishes could best be relieved; and it is well before applying for a new committee to consider the remedy 'which they recommended. Their repor; was made on the 17th of December, 1800. (Vol. IX., 1803.) After stating that they had received complaints frora the parishes of St. Matthew Bethnal-green, Mile-end Nevrtown, Christ Church Spital6elds, of the very great number of the poor who were induced to reside in those parishes by the cheapness of lodging occasioned by the general 8maDness of the tenements, and by the impossibility of finding suitable accommodation in the richer parts of the metropolis, and after quoting the poor-rates of the complaining district as being be'ween 4s. and 6s. in the pound, which, though not materially,higher than in some otherparishes, created a very severe pressure on account of the poverty of the rate. payers, that the workhouses were quite full and the poor but very inefficiently relieved, the report continues:-- " Your committee, in proceeding to consider the remedy for the evil which they have stated, have adverted to a clause in the Act of the 43d ofEliza'beth (entitled 'An Act for the Relief of the Poor.")-It says:- "If the justices shall perceive that the inhabitants of any parish are not able 'to levy among themselves sufficient sums of money for the purposes aforesaid, that then the sid two justices shall and may tax, rate, and assess, as aforesaid, any other of other parishes, or out of any parish within the hundred where the said parish 4 to pay such sumS or sums of money to the churcnvwardens and overseerm of the said poor parish for the said purposes as the said justices shaU think fit, according to the intent of thie law and if the said hundred shal not be thought by the said justices able and fit to relieve the said several parishes not able to provide for themselves as aforesaid, then the justics of the peace at their General Quarter Sessions or the greater number of them, shal rate and assess, asaforesaid, any other of other parishes, or oat of any parish within the said county for the pmrposes aioresaid, as in their discretion shall seem fit," The committee proceed to sy . "This clause vhen acted upon, as it has been in some instanees, is understood to have led to great litigation be.- tween parishes, and to have failed of much of its jutended effect; and the mode of carrying it into execution appears to your committee to be particularly iU-calculated to provide ai remedy for the evil which they have described, though it it affords3adcear proof of the general intention of the Legislatore in this respeCt. It shows that it was not the ptirpose of Parlsiament that parishes burdened in aparticular manner with poor should be so far insulated from all others as never to cal on them for relief, and that even whole counties were considered as liable, if necessary, to be charged with additional poor-rates, in order to ease contiguous parishes which were alike burdened. " But in respect to the manner of apportioning the new burden it gives much more discretion to magistrates than they can be supposed to be desirons of exercising, while also, leaving evidently out of its contemplation the case of a few adjacent parishes, all equally disabled from supporting their poor, through their contiguity to the metropols, it directs the levying of the auxiliary rate only in a part of that particular hundred which comprehends the paisor parishes in distress ; except, indeed, that where such whole hundred shall have been rendered in the zame degree incapable of affording further support to the poor, direction is there given to raise the whole sum that is necessary arbitrarily in any part of the same county. " But however defective this clause of the Act of Eliza. beth may be, tho general principle of it is so equitable in itself, and is so easily rendered applicable to the case of over burdened parishes adjoining to London, that your com. mittee are induced to express their very clear opinion of the expediency of so far following it as to authorize the raising of some local fund for the purpose of easing the three parishes of whose distrem complaints have been made. " Your committee have only further to observe that they trust the levying of a local tax through the metropolis, with the view that has been stated, will not be considered as opening the way to any invasion of that general principle of the Poor Laws by which parishes which have sufficient means of maintaining their poor are exclusively charged with their support-a principle which they deem h-gay 3onducive to the good management of the poor, and respect. ig the preservation of which the House can scaredy be too jealous. x our committee conceive that the measure now proposed, being founded on the principle laid downin one of the clausesof that Act from which the Poor Laws of this country took their rise, and being also called for by the singular circumstances of the district which they have described, as well as by the extraordinary pressure of the present time, will form no precedent which can be Dleaded, except in some case of similar emergency, and iii a like period of dearness of provid5ons and consequent distress." This principle of a rate-in-aid of an overburdened parish from the surrounding district, laid down for our gaidance by Sir Francis Bacon and the other great statesmen of the age of Elizabeth, has received the sanction of some of the leading statesmen of thepresent day. During the debates that took place a few years since on the amendment of the Irish Poor Law, so as to meet the exigencies of the famine, two BiUs were brought into the House of Commons in two following years, which contain the fullest application of the principle. They provide that whenever the sum paid for the relief of its poor by any electoral district shall exceed 2s. 61. in the pound the surplus above the 2s. Gd. shall be paid out of the union common fund. These Bils bear on their backs, if I mistake not, the names of Lord John Russell, Sir George Grey, Mr. G. Cornewall Lewis, and Sir W. Somerville. These Bills, or certainly one of them, passed through the House of Commons, and were stopped in the Lords as not meeting the existing state of things in Ireland, since whole provinces, and not single electoral districts, were at onoe struck with famine, and if aid could be got in Ireland it must be from distant and more fortunate communities I believe that Mr. Pitts committee and Losrd John Russell's Bills contain the only true solution of the difficulty of easing a parish oppressed by an unreasonable burden of poor-rates. A metropolitan rate-in-aid, or a union rate-in-aid. might readily be made self-acting, and be caled into existence whenever the sum expended by any parish in the bond Aid. support of its own poor exceeds a certain amount. In Ireland, where the whole burden of the Poor laws was a new one, 2s. 6d. in the pound might fairly be taken as the point at which a rate-in-aid should be demanded. In England, where the same parishes have been for a. great number of years subject to a poor-rate, perhaps exceeding that amount which has for generations been calculated upon in all valuations for sales, rents, and encumbrances, it would probably be considered right to fix it at a higher figure. At all events, it is the remedy prescribed by our Poor, Laws ever since they existed against those crushing inilictions of poor-rates which have from time to time arisen in many parts of England in cases of severe local distress. It should be seriounly considered whether the amendment of the rate-in-aid clause of the 43d of Elizabeth, on the prin. ciples laid down by the authorities I have given, is not one of the greatest deside-ata In English Poor Law legisla. tion. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. VI WTXT.r ?tirVnM' Wolverley.house, Worcestersbire.
PORT,GuESP CATnE.-Hlis Majesty the ling of Portugal has just sent over to this country a present of cattle of a very peculiar breed to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, eonsisting of a bull, two heifer', and a bull calf. The animals are of tihe most perfect symmetry, and very diminutive, standing scarcely 40 inches high; they are of a daa colour, and in -fine condition. The cows aye very docile, but the bull on being driven from the station to Prince Albert's modol farm at Froginore, where they are now instaled, exhibited a di8,0sition rather the reverse of that of bis companions, by tossing an unfortunate donkey about his own size which lappeaed to come in his way.

THR SLAVE TRADE WITH BRAZIL. TO THE EDITOR OF TaE TIMES. Sir,-The foree and truth of your remarks on the African slave trade, so far as Caba is concerned, are undeniable. But when, in one or two passags of your artiole, you plce Brazil on the same offending footing as Cuba, and urge against Brazil the same stringent military meAsures yon require to be applied to Cuba, then you inflict serious injustice on BraziL For, while the American journal calculate that the number of Africans actually and Bafely landed in Cuba is at the rate of 10,000 a-year, to say nothing of nearly equally large importationsof Chinese coolies who are reduced to a state of servitude quite as bad, while it lasts, as negro slavery, it was been officially stated, without contradiction, in the correspondence between Great Britain and BraziL zespecting the slave trade, laid before Parliament lASt summer, that during the four years precedingJuly, 1856, only 26 Africans had been introducediatothat empire, and on the 15th of July, 1856, Lord Palmerston told the House of Commons " the slave trade might be regarded as extinct in Brazil" Since that date there is not even the saspicion of a saucesaful slave trade venture in Brazil. After receiving a single cargo of Chinese coolies the Imperial Government allowed a contract it had formed with a Boston shipping house to expire, so that Brazil is as free from participating in the horrors of that commerce as it is in the horrors of the African slave trade. The remarks applicable to Coba are therefore wholly in. applicable to BraziL Within the last seven years there has been a eomplete revolution in the policy of that empire, and this change of i policy at last enabled Lord Palmerston to say, " The slaveI trade may be regarded as extinct in Brazil." Well might his Lordship do so, for, while in 1848 60,000 Africans were imported into the empire, not a single negro is now landed on a coast 3,000 miles in length, at no great distance from the ports of Western Africa, whence Cuba still obtains its 10,000 victims annually, and with aseabetween so calm that the frailest bark can traverse it in safety. The revolution condsts simply in public opinion in Brazil having arifved at the conclusion that a continuance of the African save trade was not only a moral evil, persistence extended to the corruption of the country, but a political danger, full of hazard to the general tranquillity. Brazil is a free country, with free institutions, with a Parliamentary system in fulU play, and with a Sovereign as thoroughly constitutional, as pure and simple in his life, and as cultivated and intelligent as our own most gracious Monarch; and, in obedience to this pablic opinion, the Cabinet of Brazil propo6ed, and the Legislature of Brazil enacted, laws in 180 of BO effective a character against the slave trade that Lord Palmerston in a circular despatch presented them as models of legislation to the Governments of Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, &o. Those laws you will find in the appendix to the report of Mr. Hume's committee on our slave trade treaties, which sat in 1353. Further legislation followed in 18a1 and 1852; but laws are nothing unless well and faithfully executed. This legidation was most loyally carried out by the Government. First of all, in excess, perhaps, of law, the great slavetraders, none of whom were native Brazilians, were obliged to break up their estblishments and to leave the empire One carried his wealth to Lisbon, where he was ennobled; I myself saw in Paris the funeral of another, who left bebind him 400,0001.; a third went to Genoa, his native place; and the trade was completely destroyed in the empire. Then the Government set about building anavy, calculated to watch and guard the coast; corvette after corvette has left London for that purpose; ill the last report of the Minister of Marine I find that the Brazilian slave-trade squadron on the coast outnumbers the British; of the two 'United States' ventures that have been made, one-the ayE. 1Smith-wau captured by a Brazilian crmuser. and officers of the Brazilian navy have lately re. ceived the thanks of the Queen's Government for their noble exertions. Along the whole line of the coast of the slave provinces (for in many parts of the empire slavery does barely exist) a very effective police service has been organized, and by it the other American venture, the "Packet-boat," was captured at Serenhaom. Over th, slave provinces presidents notorious for their hostility to the slave trade have been appointed. Among the number ML de Macedo, the late minister at this Court-an appoint. raent which Lord Clarendon loudly praised in a discussion which Lord MAImesbury Last year raised in the House of Lords. For the punishment of aU slave trade offences a special and exceptional tribunal haz been erected. And it appears by papers laid before Parliament that the Brazilian Minister at Washington keeps so sharp an eye over the proceedings of the slave trade carried on from New York as to be able to furnish important information to the British Minister, and actually sent to Rio de Janeiro photographs of the vessels which the Brazilian authorities captured. This is what Brazil has done. The American journals, I repeat, tell us that Cuba isimportiug 10,000 Africans a-year, and it was only the other day that your Madrid correspon. dent stated that General Conchs was coming home from the government of that island, after two years' residence, wirh $1,000,000 in his pocket. Surely, then, it isnot just now to place Brazil in the same category as Cuba. But is this policy likely to lastl All the probabilities point to an affirmative reply. The future hopes of Brazil lie in advancing European civilization. A revival of the sLave trade would have the opposite tendency; it would reduce an empire fuLU of youthful aspirations and of noble prospects to the plight of a mere material productive colony, inhabited by sordid moneygetters only; it would repel Christian immigration, and completely barbarize the labouring population of the country. Terminating the African slave trade, Brazil turns to Europe, and particularly to Germany and Italy, for supplies of free labour. She is at present making immense preparations to promote free colonization; and though the number of free immigrants does not reach the number of Africans formerly imported, it is not much short of 30,0001 a-year. Although the African slave trade is suppressed, and although inx places the slave population has been diminished by the ravages of cholera, the production of Brazil goes on increasing; its prosperity augments, so also does its revenue. The cessation of the slave trade liberated an immense amount of capital, which is now more legitimately and successfully employed in productive enterprises which stimulAte production, and in diminishing the cost of cultivation by finding substitutes for manual labour. Sugar, the terrible abour of slavery, has ceased to be the chief article of Brazilian export; and coffee, a much lighter labour, has iaken its place, to the immense benefit of labour, slave and free. There is, moreover, a pride in wleU doing which must have great influence. The Emperor himself leads the youth and spirit of the empire in their hostility to the -lave trade The last general election indicated that " Young Brazil" is fast gaining political ascerdancy. But, in truth, for the last seven years there has been no slave trade interest in the Legislature; the controversy between the two parties has been to whom the credit of this change is due; and the l1te Marquis of Parana, the Prime Minister, afew monthsbefore his death told the British Minister, at the close of a remarkable conversation, and not of the most friendly description, "as long as he was in office, 'whether with or without a treaty, he would strain every nerve for the suppression of the slave trade," But enough. I have at all events shown that Brazil is exempt from the censure you have passed on Cuba. I am, Sir, your most obedient servant. JUSTICE. By 2L TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The appearance of your leader in this day's impression must be hailed with grateful satisfaotion by all those who yearn for the complete annihilation of the accursed slave trade. Humanity has indeed secured a powerfal advocate, and vith your aid there can be little doubt that the existing sham will be replaced by an earnest practioal enforcement of existing treaties, and the adoption of such measures as may be necessary to frustrate the devices of those foreigners whose Governments refuse or neglect to aid in the suppreasion of the traffic. You have well put the dilemma in which our Government is placed, and it remains for the cotntry to determine whe. ther we shall incur the risk and the hostility which active measures woald necessarily involve, or continue in our position " of moderate and hesitating imbecility." Let me call attention to the following facts, which ane of indisputable authority :-In the month of June, 1854, the brig Grey Eagle was captured, but not until a cargo of 600 slaves had been landed; the crew had taken to the bush after removing their colours, papers, &c., so that there was no evidence as to the vessel's actual nationality; but as she had everything on board necessary for her condemnation she was taken into Havannah for adjudication. After repested delays, extending over 12 months, she was " thrown out," as the phrase is. because there was reason to fear she was American property I Thus the captors were liable for having detained this vessel, -had any owners dared to come forward to claim her. Is,ittlikely, under these circumstanoeg, that any cap. taia woul willingly incur such risks; or can any one be sur,prised, afteasuch a decision, that most slayers now use American-hujt,pssels9 The following ,y4:ws, expressed by Capigin 'Hapcock B.,., w1o0oK4RMralr yckrs in comMan&9f kpn^ker will be Tead wih interest:-"So o ra but humane officer, "As the United States' Government mantin th, present system and forbid foreign ship5 of war to search suspicious veu6eS under their Big, so long wm that flag be used for all dishonourable acts upon the high seM. No improvement in the actual system cam be ve ffeeve Esoong as one foreign flag can ?os thron4 our ' cordon' unsearched. We have never yet had nearly a mfficient number of cruisers on the cout of Caba. During the tine I was employed there we never bad more than fou or five, and frequentl les. Now, a glance at the chart will convinoe any one of the utter absurdity of attempting to watch such an extent of coast with four or five vessels. Take the south coast alone from Cape Mayal to Cape St Antonio-some 700 milesi and then remember tbat in con: sequence of the Ca g crmsers of the usual sire are forced to remain ouSside, and therefore, in most places, out of sight of the mainland; whereas vessels used as slavers are of light draught, and, being provided with the beat pilots, can ely enter these inner waters, aud choose their time and point for landing. I consider that to carry out the system of craizers efficiently at least 15 or 16 vessels of light draught would be required, havingauxiliary steam power, to be ued oly srhen in chase, for in those clear skies smoke is seen for many miles, and-no slaver would approach a steamer." From the foregoing facts and suggestions many usefal couchdsions may be drawn, and I would earnestly appeal to all those whose position ensures active influence to grapple with the subject as alone can be done by British determina. tion and energy. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. LEONARD ROWE VALPY. a, opr1nggarmens, h1by ZL

The late lr Smith, of Deanaton, was a manufacturer, and by his restless efforts to reclaim waste lands became world-famous. Mr. Sheriff3fechi, of the celebrated Tiptree-farm, is a London merchant, and, although engaged much in botupnba and private business, has leisure to show annually to the gathering of noblemen and gentlemen at Tiptree-hall what can be done when vigorously gone about by the aid of artificial nanures and good management in mabng what was formerly a barren heath "blossom as the rose.' It is only a few years since Mr. Caird astonished thpubli by exhibiting in his pmphlet on High Farming the annual balance-sheet of Mr I'Culloch of Auchness, who, if we mistake not, was bred an innke.per in AyrOne has only to go to the foot of the classic Doon to see farming conducted in the highest style of art-if we may borrow the term-by a merchant largely engaged in commeroe. ile these things have been going on in various parts of the country scarcely any of the farmers around Glasgow bave gone out of the old jog-trot of their forefathers, but with abundance of cheap manure to be had, and being near good and ready markets, have been content to let well alone. This stigma, if it may be caUed so, has been reroved by a gentleman of this city, who, having a little leisure in his old days, has resolved to devote his remaining years, together with all his eDergy and skill, for the benefit of his fellow-countrymen. He has therefore commenced the cultivation of a model farm in the neighbourhood of Govan, and after trying the various qualities of a large number of manures, both solid and liquid, the idea occurred to him that what was good to stimulate animal Ihfe might have an equal effect on tho vegetable kingdom. While cogitating on this novel scheme he, no donut, hesitated as to the propriety of plants, inhaling alcohol at unseasonable hours, as well as the immoral tendency it would, produce in the locality; hut as our experimentalist is somewhat interested in the proper selection of thearticle, he resolved to administer to each plant a different kind of whisky. Day after day he may be seen wending his way down the Govan road with a flask filled with the real "mountain dew," and on arriving at his farm he carefully applies the contents to the roots of several garden plants, But these cabbages and cauliflowers are more honoured than any cabbages or caulflowers were before, as one is named "Glenlivet," after the name of the manure applied,another "BenNevis," "Ardberg," "Campbeltonentire," "Adelphi," "plainimalt,"andso on;ri.thoughsome of hismaliciousneighbours insinuate that he only follows the example of the Irishman,who got from his master some whiskytoremovecertin grease spots from a window he was cleaning, swallowed the lquor, and then blew hiz breath on the glass, saying, when questioned, " it was all the same." This, of course, is only spleen, which all men must apparently encounter who have te boldnoesto chalk- out a new line of action for themselves. We have reason to know that the model farm thrives apace, that the new node of irrigation continues to prosper m one form or another, and, as his experiment must be interesting to our agricultural readers, we shall watch its development, and make them acutaited witlk the result, Vegetarians and total abstainers must look with great anxiety on this experimnent, as they may antticipate that they wrill yet be made " glorious" on vegetable diet, wiithout in any way violating their sacred pledges.-Glasgoso ImP1tovmaENms ifN PAnsL-ThE BOULEVARD DlD SEDASTOPOL-This magnificent thoroughfar is within 470 metres of its completion on the right bank of the Seine, and will, in its progress, entirely absorb the Enclos de la Trinite, a nest of horrid little filthy lanes occupying the Space where the Hospital de Is Trinist stood, which dated from 1202, and was chiefly reserved for pilgrims, Towards the end of the 14th oentury the monks of this establishment let out the largest hall of the building to the Confreres de Ia Passon, a company of comedians, In 1536 the Parliament of Paris ordered a portion of the hospital to be reserved for patients labouring under contagious disorders,- but this decree was never put into force, and the establishment was at length devoted to the education of poor children. ToVwards the end of the 18th century the hospitl was pulUed down, and houses for workmen were erected on the site. After the Enclos de la Trinite, the Boulevard de Sebastopol will encounter the Passge Basfour, where it will in time be crosed by a large and elegant streetwhichis to extend in a straight line from the Boulevard des Capucines to the Boulevard des FiDles du Calvaire. Next in the order of demolition come the dark and fetid Rue Gu6rin Boisseau and the Ruetdu Ponceau, which was built by Frangois Miron, r&vot des marchands, in 1605. At that time two citizens and a nobleman, who possessed several houses in the Rue St. Denis, opposed the plan, on the ground that it would diminish the value of their property; the rrevost, however, refused to yield to their arguments, whereupon they excited the populace to rebellion, invaded the place, pat several of the masons to death, and drove the remainder away. On learning this, Francois Miron pro ceeded to the spot at the head of a large police-force, captured the ringleaders, and had them all three struang rp by the same rope. Henri IV., on being informed of ihis exploit, wrote the following letter to the prevost-" Conpire, Iknew you werea man of parts; now I know you are a masn of cour e; if youwvra a second, think of me. Iombraceyou.- [easi" From this spot a street will be pierced at right angles to the principal entrance of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, and the Boulevard de Sebastopol, after absorbingthe Rue de Tracy aud the Passage de la Longue ALI', will finaly reach the Boulevard St. Martin, when the splendid Strasburg terminus will become directly visiblefrom the Place du Chfitelet. DEAT= OF M3f. RonxRT BUIN,s.-We have to announce the demise of Mr. Robert Burns, which melancholy event occurred on the afternoon of Thursday, the 14th inst,, at his residencea here. Mr. Burns was born at Mauchline in September, 1786, so that he had nearly completed his 71st year. In several respects in point of intellect the deceased was no ordinary man, but yet he was chiefly remarkbble throughout life as being the eldest son of Robert Burns, the national poet of Sootland. Burns died in 1796, and his eldest boy was nearly ten years of age at the time of that premature decease. Mr. Burns was an accomplished seholar. Endowed with a prodigious memory and great powers of application, he had amassed a vast quantity of Knewledge on a great range of subjects. Eis enthusiasm in the acquisition of information continued to almost his last days, and for some years he had been almost passiouately attached to the study of the language of the GaeL In music hoewasaproficient student, possessng both a theoretical and practical knowledge of the art.

FRIGHTFuL DETgr.-On Wednesday afternoon Mr. C. St. Clair Bed ford, coroner for Westminster, and , bighly re,,table jury assembled at the mansion of Sir E aC w. Macnaghten, No. 42, Upper Brook-street, Grosvenor-square, to investigate the rightful eircun. stances attending the death of Wmss Mary Mscnaghten, aged 25. The jury, having been sworn, proceeded to view the body, which lay in an adjoining room. It presented X horrid spectace, the head, face, neck, and arms being almost literally charred, so that no feature could bo dis. tinuhed. The deceased had evidently been a tall, finel. framed young woman. On the retorn of the juxy, Edward Charles Workman Macnaghten was examined,4 He was deeply affected, a-ad deposed that the deoeased Wv4 his eldest daughter. About haV-p 10 o'clock on Mo4. day morning last he heard loud screams, and, proceeding fe where the sounds came from, found deceased at the bottonh of the stairs in the ball, enveloped in flames. The Sr5was extinguished by the butler, and deoNsed was takea into the adjoining room and plaoed upon a couch, then in a senseless state. She shortly after recovered hee consciousness, and told him (witness) that she knew she should not reoover, that she wished to die, and resse& surprise that she did not feel more pain. In explaini how the burning had occurred, she said that she was in the drawing-room engaged in writing, and that while so engael she felt an extraordinary degree of warmth about net feet, which at first she conceived to be merely fancy, but on looldDg down she perceived that she had trodden upon a lucifer match, which had set fire to the lower part of her dress. The carpet was found to have been burnt through around the spot wbere the match had been ignited TheW match had no doubt fallen out of a box oontaining others, which were used to light a candle for sealing letters Thin attendance of medical gentlemen was immediately ob. tamed, but, notwithstanding the most unremitting exer. tions, the deoeased exp*ied about ten hours after the acci. dent. Walter Wall, butler to Sir Edmunnd, stated that ai the time mentioned he was in the pantry, whenheheardloul; screams, and found deceased as his master had described The flames in which she was enveloped were at least threet feetabove her head. He endeavoured to extinguish then3 with hishands, buS without success, and he then rushed and procured a, baize table-cover, wElobhe flung-over her and thus succeeded in extinguishing the flames. Mr. 1Issa Baker Browvn, surgeon, described the injuries of deoeasedj observing that the hody was burnt frou the soles of the feet; tiO the crowvn of the head. All that could ho done for beeyas to llevite the p by admiir oplun. Thg death was caused by the severe and frightl burnsng. Tg. coroner trusted that the verdict the jury would give znibhi have the effect of induoing more care in the use of siefmatches. The jury returned a verdict to the effectthai. deceased died from burns received on Monday, thel8th; inst., in consequence of her clothes having caugh fire bj the accidental ignition of a lucifer match [Advertisement]-The Public Purse; ana how Ber p~rotect It-The Prinemm Rovsal?
