IRELAND. V-- - .- DUBLIN, SArURDAY MoRh-LxG. EPISCOPAL VIEW OF TIE INDIAN RELTBs FUND. The Roman Catholio Bishop of Leighlin and 'erns (Dr. Walshe) sends the following reply to an invitation to attend the Carlow meeting to assist the Bufferers in India. The skilfully constructed language and the assumed tone of moderation which characterize the right rev, prelate's letter canaot conceal its animnvs, and the more blunt and outspoken pastoral of Dr. Cullen was not better calculated to damagge the benevolent object in view than thae oily epistle which runs as follows:- Bragauza-house, Carlow, Oct. 24. iSir,-I regret that I ceanot attend at the meeting to be held at Callow on Monday, ' to take into oonsidoration the propriety of contributing to the relief of the sufferers from the mutiny in India.' I will be eDgaged on Monday with other duties at a distancoe from home. We all, o,f course, abhor the atrocities which have been perpetrated in India, and synmpathize deeply with the viotims of these appalling disasters. To inquire into the causes of these calamities is not now our purpose. Such inquir vwill, I presume, occupy the attention of the rulers of India, and the result, we may hope, will be instructive and useful. The object of your meeting is of a more simple ard consoling character-to testify our condolence with the ssfferers, and to relieve their distress, How painful it is to rtflect on the number of families, lately so happy, that have been suddenly plunged into dark and deep affliction by the desolating havoc we all deplore. I will not suppcse that there is any discrepancy of opinion about the pro. priety of relievin the sufferers;* all, I trust, are ready to give-they who have little, to give eheir mites, and they whom Providence bath blessed with abundance to give abundantly to supply the wants of the distressed. Bat there is ) et a difficulty about the mode of discharging this duty. 'I bave beard,' to use the words of Sir John Pal;ington, in his letter to the Lord Mayor on the 18th Inst., ' that there exist on the public mind, in combination with a desire to subscribe, a feeling that no adequate security has yet been offered with respect either to the re3ponsibility under which the fund is to be administered, or the principles, regulations, or conditions under which it is to be applied.' The feeling of mistrusr. to which the right hon. baronet refers has, I belleve, arisen from the manner of the distribution of tha Patriotio yund, and from the treatment of the children and orphans of soldiers with regard to schools and orphanages. With every disposition to co-operate in the present praiseworthy undertaking, many, I apprehend, will be withheld from doing so by the fear that what is given with enlightened and comprehensive views may be disbursed in a different spirit. It would, in my opinion, be easy to dispel this fear, and secure the confidence of all. It is obviously modt desirable that some provision be made to attain this laudable object, and to enable us all to labour togetheras we desire to do-in this work of benevolence. It is lamentable that there are any grounds for difference in this matter, particularly at a penod when the hearty union of all is peculiarly useful to the common weal; such union cannot be firmly and abidingly maintained unless we observe a due and becoming regard for the just rights and feelings of each other. Your meeting has, no doubt, been convened in this apirit, and will, I am sure, so far as it is within the power of the meetiDg, endeavour to remove the mistrust and to provide that the Christian benevolence which creates this fund will preside over its administration and protect it from being soiled by anything unworthy of the noble charity for which it is designed. 1 pray you to excuse the length of this letter, and to accept the assurance of the sentiments of profound respect with which I have the honour to be, Sir, your faithful servant in Christ, "-I- JAMES WALISHE "The High Sheriff, County Carlow." In reference to the meeting at which the foregoing letter was read, at which the Rev. Mr. Maher (Dr. Culen's uncle) endeavoured to make a little politicoreligious capital out of the stale charges of unfairness in the management of the Patriotic Fund, the Carlow &Sdbi-el of this day supplies some facts which those reverend and right-reverend calumniators wiU find difficult of digestion:- "Our readers will romember that a fund was oreated in aid of the wives and children of the soldiers who enibarked for the Crimean war, and that subsequently another was created called the Patriotic Fund. In the town of Carlow, including local subscriptions of about 10t. from the ladies' committee, a sum of 3571. 10s. was paid to soldiers' wives and children from the 17th of July, 1854, to the 14th of Nay, 1316, and in every case the parties receiving relief -were exclusively Roman Catholics. Twenty-seven women aid 40 children (all Roman Catholics) at the close of the war were in receipt of regular aid from the central committee, and they were sent to every part of the kingdom, with am ple means to join their husbands and parents, who haa arrived from the Crimea. Now, we take it for g,ranted if these facts were known to the public that the 1Roman Catholic bishop or the Rev. Mr. Maher would have entertained no susplicon of the mode in which the funds were appropriated. With reference to proselytism, there is an equally strong fact-sufficient to dispel the delusion which appears to have taken possession of the mind of MEr. Maher and others of our countrymen. The delusion is manifestly visionary, and that there was no julstification for the charge against the trustees is manifest from the fact that not a single case was ever brought forward to sustain it. r. Portor states, and the circumstance Is an undoubted fact, that at this moment, in Carlow, there are two orphans, the children of a Roman Catholic soldier, who perished in the Crimea-their mother, an Englishwoman, a Protestant survives-nevertheless, these children receive through their protector, a Roman Catholic, the sum of 161. per annum, punctually paid by the trustees of the Patriotic Fund; and theso children, with their concurrence and knowledge, are brought up in, and are educated in Carlow, mn the Romar. Catholic faith, professed by their father! Is this a proof of proselytism ? Is it a proof of the parSial appropriation of the funds intrusted to their charge for the benefit of the w:dows and orphans of the gallant men who fell in the cause of their country ? Here are, at all events, substantial proofs that no attempt was made by the trustees of the fund, or by any local authority engaged in Its distribution, to tamper with tho religious belief of the brave soldier who fell m the service of his countr." THE IRISII IN AMERICA. The Kilkemssy Tos-rnaZ announces that Monsignor Frannois Maria Charbonelle, Bishop of Toronto, plpper Canada, passed through that city within tae past few days, and remained during his stay at the Capuchin Convent, Walkin-street, of which order he is a distinguished member. He celebrated mass in the convent chapel a few days ago, and subsequently addressed the congregation, and earnestly entreated the people, if they could by any possibility remain in Ireland, not to think of emigrating, as it was almost incredible the misery and wretchedness he constantly witneesed among the unfortunate Irish emigrants. THE LATE 5TH DRACOONS. it is stated that Lieutenant-Colonel Palmer, M.P.. South Mayo Rifles, and one of the famous "600" at Balaklava, several weeks since proposed to the Government the raising of the 5th Dragoons at his own expense, should the authorities consider the increase of our cavalry regiments necessary in the present precarious state of India, as well as our home defences. This officer is well known in the service, having by his skill and, coolness when a captain (and in coinmand of a few troops) of the 17th Lancers, saved the town of Huddersfield from almost certain destruction, by intercepting and dispersing an armed mob of Chartists, numbering over 50,000. PIRESSURE ON THE IBSH BANKS. Accounts from Waterford mention that many of the country people have called at the banks in that 4ity in order to change their paper for gold. It is almost needless to remark that the calls were promptly met, and that public confidence remained 'unshaken. A local paper says:- "There need be no fears relative tothe Irish banks, for they are believed to be far more prosperous at the present moment than ever they were; and such unnecessary and senseless conduct as this will have the effect of recoiling on these who draw the money, as weU as on the whole countr generally; it will bring down prices, and may possibly leadl to robberies, as people drawving gold in this way are often -watched from the bank to their own doors. The swindling conduct of the Sadleirs is in many cases the cause of these periodical panics; but at the present moment there is no room for the least apprehension of insecurity." THIE i'UTDEPR OF SIR. ELLIS. The following statement appears in the Mail of last nig,ht . punity is not liely to be oaflo6ntg dnudrattion.d ;Sevteira pries against whom strong suspicion points are iu the custody of the police. An extra constabulary force of 20 men eommianded by a vigilant inspector have been rent to the loality, and the charge-about SOOt. per annum-must be raid by the neighbouring inhabitants, under the Pease f'reservatian Act, 1856. The provision of the statute vvhiel imposes this heavy penalty is but a renewal of thelaw o Alfred, which made the hundred answerable for any felony committed within its ircit, unless hue-and-cry was made and the felon detected and brought to justice; bat the Peace Preservation Act gives the Lord-Lieutenant power to allocate the charge so as to exempt the innocent and place it on the shoulders of those who have connived at the crlme or sympathize with the criminal. in many instances the pressure of the tax has cocroed the peasantry to ive the murderer to justice, and it is to be hoped that it wilnot be ineffectual In the present instance. Two stipendiary magistrates are on the spot, aided by some of the best ofiicers of the constabulary force, and there seems every reason te hops that this recurrence to agrarian murder, so disgraceful to the country and destructive to its beet interest, will not be fostered by impunity.

THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY ON THE MUTINY IN INDADIA. The Right Hon. the Earl of SHuT'SBURY presided at sa meeting in aid of the sufferers in India, held at the New Town-hall, Wimuborne, on Friday last The noble earl in oponing the proceedings said, -Ladies and gentlemen, we are assembled here to-day upon a serious, I might almost alU i-, a solemin, occasion. We are here to contribute ell that we can afford towards that fund which is now being raised fo: the relief of our suffering countrymen and countrywomen I will not dwell upon this point, because I am quite sure that no argument will be necessary to incite you to give of your abundance according to your mean to the relief of such direful necessities. Bat we are also here to sympathize with those who have suffered unprecedentel miseries, resnlting, I must say, from unprecedented crimes; for whether we consider the things that have been done. or the persons who have done them, I do not hesitate t b affirm that ihistory will not furnish a parallel of atrocity either in the principle or in the amtual perpetration of the cruelty. Well, now then, what were the things that weredone? I must confess before I enter upon this sabject that I hava been astonished that some persons should have been found tb maintain that there ought to be a reserve upon the publication of those enormous crimes; that the British public should not be told in plain, forcible, and trae language, what has been done by these men, and what has been en. dured by their countrymen and countrywomen in the East Indies. These atrocities ought to be known as marking a period in the history of our race, marking a period that in the 19th century men should be found in any nation capable of such enormous crimes, and marking a period that, under the good providence of God, there should at the same have been found people professing the Christian religion capable of endaring with heroism pains and insults more grievous than ever were inflicted on any people since the earliest days of martyrdom. I was astonished that such reserve should have been advised. Doubtless there is a certain reserve that must be practised in the matter of public writings, because the cruelties, if recorded, are so vile, so disgusting, so offensive to every sense of modesty and shame, so outrageous, so exceeding human imagination, that many would recoil from the narrative, and many would reject it as untrue. But surely there are some things that ought to be brought before the British public when we are appealing to them, first, for contributions, and secondly for sympathy. I do think that the history of these cruelties presents a series of atrocities for which youL will find no parallel in any history whatsoever. Hundreds, thousands have been massacred in the onslaught of towns, provinces have been ravaged, thousands have been put to death in the momentary excitement of rage and under the Influences of an assault, but where have you heard of such cruelties perpetrated In cold blood wben I tell you that I myself saw a letter from the highest lady now in India stating that day by cday ladies were coming iuto Calcutt% with their ears and their noses cut off and their eyes put out -when I tell you that children of the tenderest years hive been reserved to be put to death under circamstances of the most exquisite torture, not in moments of excitement as you read of in history when the town of Magdeburg was sacked by the Imperialists, but reserved to be tortured in cold blood with the utmost refinement of Imagination before the eyes of their parents, who were mado witnesses of the cruelties, and who were made to swallow portions of the flesh cat from the limbs of their chiid!ni, and themeelves afterwards barnt over a slow fire, to gratlfy the malignity and the hellish temperament of those creatures who bore the human form? And who were they that perpetrated these atrocities? Was this a nation rising in a sense of its wrongs-writhing under torture, plunder, oppression, shd cruelty-writhing under the violation of every sacred and social right-rising to recover their lost liberties, risiug as one man to assert their independenoe and the integrity of their religion? No such thing. Has any proclamation been put out by the rebels that they have a single wrong to complain of ? Have you found in any one instance a national or even the symptom of a national rising? Has not the whole country, with very few exceptions, beon perfectly tranquil and quiescent? Eave not the greater part of the villagers assisted the Royal troops and attempted to discomfit the mutineers? Wherever an exception occurred it may be traced to the brigands and those wild lawless hordes that always will be found on the continent of India, wandering from one viUage to another. The villagers themselves in no instance have risen against the British power; on the contrary, they have known that their security consisted in the vigour and permanence of Her Majesty's dominion. Who, then, were the mutineers, and from whom arose this flightful rebellion ? It arose from a monster of our own creation; it arose from an army pampered, flattered. overpaid and underworked; it arose from an army that we had raised by discipline into the attitude it had assumed, and having given it that discipline and that knowledge of arms uinder the military profession, by our foolish system and by our neglect we allowed it to acquire a sense of its own imporbance and the conviction that it could act independently of its European officers, and that it was as capable as it was willing to take the empire into its own hands. Whence did we draw these soldiers? We drew them in all their barbarism, in all their corruption from the votaries of the goddess Kali-votaries of the grossest, filthiest cruelties that ever disgraced mankind. We drew It from a set of men to whom morality was a dead letter, and then, having constituted them into an army, having given them discipline and the force of arms, we wonder that these men turn round upon us and say, the power we have we wll make our own; you are 'lependent upon us and we wiU make you feel the force of our authority. But as for grievance, what grievance was ever put forward? God knows there is much to be laid to our charge in the government of India, but there is nothing to be laid to our charge in the rule of the Sepoy army, except the charge of folly, the charge of Ignorance, the charge of flattery, the charge I may say of foolish and contemptible truckling to their pride and superstition until we made them believe that their gods were as good as our God and thelr religion as good as our reiigion. But now, bear this in mind, the retribution that folows upon these crimes must be equal to the nature and extent of those crimes themselves. I maintain that justice, pure simple justice, demands that we should exact of these men that compensation that is due to crimes unparalleled in the history of mankind. We do not ask for vengeance. God forbid that that word should be used in our declamation. God forbid that that sentiment should enter into our hearts. But there is such a thing as justice. There is such a thing as a sense of justice implanted in the human heart by the hand of God himself, and although no private individual should take private justice into his hands the sword is given to the rulers of a State, and that sword is to be exercised to maintain order and to execute the decrees of God against those who wantonly shed the blood of their fellows. Justice I maintain must be satisfied; every principle of policy, every principle of religion requires it. It is thc greatest policy In the sense of humanity that justice 3hould be fully exercised. If you do not exercise justice on this principle I maintain that our tenure of India, with all the great advantages that must result to the many milions of the human race in India, will become utterly impossible. Europeans must live isolated from one another. You cannot have every European officer guarded by a body of European troops. You must invest him with all that security, all that force that belongs to the great power of the British empire, when it is known that she wvi protect the very me?nest of her subjects in all his rights and in all the daties he is called upon to fulfil. Again,I maintain that i the sense of humanity, justice, complete justice must be done to the fulL if it be only to check tbe feeling that is rapidly growing up-and how can we wonder at it ?-among the Europeans in ndia. If the Government of that country should lead Europeans to believe that full justice was not to be done to the perpetrators of these enormotis crimes, depend upon it private justice and individual action will take the place of public justice and public aiuior. I saw a letter from a man holding almost the highest station in India, who used these emuhatic and most valuable words: -"Of all the evils pioduced by this state of things in India there is not one so great, not one so difficult to overcome, as the feeling of intense and dreadful execration that has arisen on the part of the Europeans toward every man of a coloured skim It wiU be next to impossible for many years to come that we in the government of India shall be able to do anhing for the benefit of the natives. I maintain (he says) that it wiU be absolutely impossible to elevate their position by placing them in any situation of trust, so great is the feeling of detestation towards them oa the part of the Europeans." Therefore, for the sake of humanity, for the sake of the natives themselves, for the tranquillity of this extensive region, the Government should come forward and say, "Trust to us; we will take care that justice shall be done upon every one of those who per- petrated these crimes; those who h,ve stained their hands blood shall pay the forfeit due to blood; those whom we think fit to spare and not consign to the execubioner shal be sent out of the country across the seas, there to suffer penal survitude for the remainder of their lives. I say this with some force and anxiety, because there* has appeared in India a proclamation which seemed to have anotber com- pletion, another tendency. But I beheve that the procla- mation which appeared the other day, signed by Lorp Canning, in which he givesplnstruction to the civil eiers f'exercise great discrimination, was intended only to ,reve., in the exasperation of feelng, any wild jrtstice. But I felt regret that the proclamation did not begn by stating what were the views of the G}overanment with resPeCt to these atrocities-that It did not begin by saying, "We admit all these atocities-trust to us to execate justice ; we hope you will not in any wild way take the execution of jastice into your own hands." Again, I was terrified by the last despatch ia consequence of reading that Mr. J. P. Grant-had gone into the North-West Provinces; and the telegraph says-I hope and trmst ib Is not true, and I know that the feeling of Her Majesty's Government is the same-that Mr. Grant has interfered with a military officer, Colonel Neill, and has set at liberty 150 of the Cawnpore mutineers,-those men who are dyed wbth blood that nothing can wash out, and who are staned with crimes that far exceed the power of imagination. If this be so, there is an end to all hopes of order and peace in India. But God forbid it should be true ! But to tuarn to another point. Look what has been done by a military officer, as yoa may read in Tle Times of yesterday. Read the general order of that noble soldierand gallant Christian Major General Wilson, to whom was confided the honour of directing the attack on the devoted city of Delhi. Mark hiswords:-"Major.GeneralWilson ueid hardly remind the troops of the crael murdersoommittedon their officers and comrades, as well as their wives and children, to mnove them in the deadly struggle. No quarter sbo ol4 be given to the mutineers. At the same time, for the sake of humanity and the honour of the country they belong to he calls uponthem tospareaUwomenandejhildren that may come in their way." I confes that when I read that general order I was almost moved to tears in deepthankfulnes to Almighty God that he had raised up such a man, and put such sentiments into his heart upon sach an ociasion; and I did also rejoice that those noble fellows uader his command, notwithstanding their exasperation, notwithstanding the fury of the assault, listenei to his request. They repudiated with horror the precedent set them by the heathen,-they spared the innocent women and children; andI call upon you to thank God and rejoice with me that you and I are fe-owvcitizens with such glorlous soldiers and such brave men. Well, now, the Sepoys were the perpetrators of all these things. Bat I nmust say I hope and trust that while the Government fiads it necessary to exercise the utmost rigour, it will, on the other hand, be unsparing in honour and reward to everyone who has done his daty on this trying occasion. I trust there will be no stint to the English soldiers, be they officers or be they privates. I trust there will be no stint to the natives, be they vllagers or be they rajahs; and we have to rejoice that there have been great instances of noble fidelity by native princes coming in with money and contingents to the siege of Delhi. Now, what do we suppose has been the cause of this insurrection? That it had not sprung from any wrong inflicted upon the people is quito clear I think there is no one single part of this history that may not be explained by the ordioary principles of human natur. I canuot believe that what they are pleased to call their religion had very much to do with the general spirit of the mutineers. That the Mahomedans had acted with great force on the leaders of the Brahminicai party I doubt not, and that these men together influenced the Sepoys. I believe the whole case is well stated in an extract from Mr. James Kennedy, missionary at Benares. He writes in these ramarkable words:-" What can be the cause of all this frenzy against us? Surely our Government has most grievously oppressed them. AUl I can say is, the people themselves give no such reply. What I have heard asserted by scores of individuals is, that our whole system, missions, schools, railways, electrio telegraphs, &o., are taking away and destroying their religon-they can stand it no longer." That is to say, these leders of false religion in India find the whole system is crambling and slipping from under their feet in the presence of civilization, that it was destroyingr the ground upon which they stood, and that the time was come to make one desperate effort to stand or fall. Bat that the 80,000 mutineers had any such sentiments as these I cannot believe. Nothing so noble had animated their breasts as the love of their own false religion. It does not appear that in one single instance they have Dat it forward as the plea for this rebellion. But when the opportunity came they murdered their officers and plunder.d the Treasury. " Money is the root of all eviL." These " noble fellows," whom we are asked to believe rebelled for their religion-these precious fellows having begun by muedering their officers, invariably proceeded to " loot " the Tpreasury. That was the beginning and end of all their operations. Don't let us believe anything so generous as adherence to their vile faith led them to these enormous crimes. It was the love of blood and the love of money. After touehing upon the sympathy whioh had been shown in other countries, particularly by the Emperorof the French and the Sultan of Turkey, his Lordship alluded to the tendency which the late events would have in keeping up our prestige as a nation. In noticing the patriotic manner in which these great events have been received by all classes and conditions among the many millions wao inhabit these islands, the noble earl sad,-What has been the conduct of thepress? I cannot but admire and express th3 deepest gratitude to the public press for the vigoar, for tie honesty of principle, for the discrimination, and for the knowledge it has exhibited throughout this great matter. I was always myself a stickler for the freedom of the press. Had I doubted it before, I must now have been convinced hat in a crisis of public danger a free press is our greatest security. It may torment and vex public men now a-d then, and make them smart and lick their sores; bat the public press is like a great and mighty flowing river ; occasionally it may burst its banks and cause an inundation, but inIts ordinaryflow it brings life, comfort, security, and joyto all around. His Lordship afterwards ssLid,-Novebefore we close we must come to this, What is to be the result of all these great successes with which it has pleased Providence to bless our arms? Are we to stop short he-a and be satisfied with victory, and not improve that victory and turn it to the best account for the benefit of man an I to the honour of God ? God forbid that we should not soe in this the most blessed opportunity that was ever affordsd men, as a nation, to do great good to the generation in whfic we live, and to generations which maycome herea'ter. Itrus. we shall begin by showing the natives of India that, although they sought our Injury, we will seek their good I truss we shall show that, having exacted justice upon the culprit, everything else shall be forgotten, and that our sola labour shall be to do everything that we can to advance their temporal and eternal interest. I trusm this will be the beginning of a new order of things-of wisdom, judgment, knowledge, and good government for all those mighty millions that are confided to our charge. But we have far higher considerations than these to which we must one ar d all, from the Queen to the ragged boy sweeping the crossing, direct our attention and our prayers. We must now entt r upon a bolder, truer, and more Chrsian course. We mast go forward in the plainest, simplest, and most open manner to declare that the Government of India is a Christian Govermnent, that It rests upon Christian principles, that it has Christian views, and that it will go forward to Christian action. Simultaneous with that, the English Government must declare that it wMll never, directly or indirectly, either by itself or permit others to use force or bribery, or any illicit mode whatsoever, in order to turn the natives from their faith. You must give to them predsely the same right in matters religious as you claim for yourselve3. His Lordship then forcibly lugued the necessity of calling upon the Government of India to declare that it shall be conducted on Christian principles, and that everything it did should have a Christrian end in view. With reference to the bugbear that the natives would be disaffected, he noticed how several inhuman rites had already been put down without being attended with any bad results. The opinior s of Colonel Edwardes and Sir I. Lawrence were adduced to show that our only hope for India was in the extension of the missions and in the diffusion of Christianity. He trusted that memorials would be presented to the Crown, and petitions to Parliament, declaring the calm-, deliberate, conscientious voice of the people of England that the only terms upon which they would consent to hold India were the Christian principles he had marked out. The favourable time at which the mutiny broke out and oth.r circumstances were adduced to show that the fing r of God had been workdng. AUl these things provei that we are yet reserved as a nation to advance the dvllization of those millions of the human race and to be the agents in the promulgation of the Gospal of His blessed Son. This is our calling-ths isiour duty. By this we must thrive, or by the neglect of it we must falI. But if Old England will act upon this basis-if she will acknowledge in all she says and all she does the truth of Christianity, generations yet to come shall say, when they look upon this empire, "1 Surely this was is great nation; surely this was an understanding people," Resolutions were afters-rardepassed expressive of sympatl'y wiith the sufferers in India, and naming a committee to obtain subscriptions, Contributions to the amount of 1471, 14s. were announced during the proceedings, and 141. la. 10d, was received at the door.
DARiNG GAROmP ROBBERY NEAR NOTTrNGHAL.- On Friday evening last, the 30th ult., as early as a quarterpast6 o'clock, a most daring garotte robbery was effected at Waeinton Hermitage, near Nottngham. .Mr. Thomas Hind, an elderly gentleman, secretary of the Nottingham Savinge. bank, was returning to that town from his residence at Sneinton. Besides a eum of mAoney in his pockets he had with him a portable writing.desk, and when within a few hundred yards of the town a man grappled his throat from behind, rendering him powerless, while a second raffian took from his pockets the sum of 16&. The attack being very sudden, and there being no passers-by at the time, the vains got away with their booty, and before Mr. Hind was suffiiently recovered to raise an alarm. A desperate attempt at garotting was made two evenings bef'ore the above out. rage in A ddison-streot, Nottingham. At half-past 7 o'clock in the evenlng Mr. P. Scott, of Castlegate, was walking in Addison-street, when he was attacked by three men, one oE whom seized Mr. Scott by the throat. Mr. Scott struggled valiantly, and having a stick with him he contrived tkeep the ruffians off, shouting loudly for assistance, which was fortunately at hand, when the illains made their escape without being captured. THE REPREsENTATION OF HARwims, -Several pentlemen appear disposed to offer themselves as candidates ,or the vacancy in the representation of Harwich, occa sioned by the melancholy death of Major Warburton. The suggestlon made in one of the papors that Mr. Layard shoulI be put in nomination does not seem, however, to have received any local response. Mr. R. J. Bagshaw, a son of the other member for the borough, has announced his intentior to solicit the suffrages of the eleotors, and the hon. gentle. man who unsuccessfully contested the representation of Great Yarmouth in 184i) has been prosecuting a canvass. Mr. Bagshaw receives, however, the support of only a portion of the Liberal party, as another section of the electors have put forward Mr. Andrew Arcedeckne, late High Sheriff of Suffolk, and a gentleman of considerable landed estate in that county. Mr. Arcedeckne observes in his address - "yprinclples aretoldin avery few words, and, although I sh go toParliament unshackled upon the broad question of voting, still I hesitate notto declare my unflinching attachment to Liberal principles, for freedom and enlightened progress, the extension of the franchise, so far as it msy not endanger the foundations of our glorious fabric ; andhI am also against continuing that odious impost upon the consolences of many-churoh-rates. . .. The promises of support are already so numerous and so flattering that to the poll I shall go upoa the day of election, where, by a continuation of your support, T shall be duly registered 'AL"' Mr. Arcedeckno appears to sustain in his address his reputation as a hurnourist. Mr. Tower, of Weald-haU, Brentwood, has also issued an address, in which he announces himself a candidate on decidedly Liberal principles. There appears to be no ground for the premature satements rublished in some of themorning papers, that Mr.Greene, MrP Prinsep, or Mr. Peacock, will again be put in nominatioll by the Conservative portion of the constittency. The hopes of the party appear to centre in Captain Jervis, a son-in-law of Mr. Chgvalier Cobbold, M.P. for Ipswich. The day of nomination has not yet been fixed, and it seems probable that the election will uot take place for some little time.

RAILWAY nIHTLLGENCE. STOCKTON ANTD DARITMaToN An extraordinrwy meeting of this company was held on Friday at Darlington, for the arpose of considering an agreement proposed to be entered nto with the Soath ,rhaom and Lincashire Union Railway Company. lir- HL P. Smm occupied the chair, and said this meet. lug was called in conaequence of some informality in the notice convenig the last. The Board of Trde haing objected to it, they were obliged to call another. The pre. sent meeting was therefore merelg a formaRl one to comply with the conditionss which wfere laid dowvn by the Board of Trade. Mr. HvTrdnusoN then read a oopy of the proposed agree. ment, after which Mr. M'Nay (secretary) read a formal resolution aporoving the agreement proosed to be entered into between tis eompany and the Sout Duam and alncashire Union Rallway Compay for the maintenance and working of that railway, sub3ect to any alteratior (if any) requiired by the Board of* Trade, and authorizingth'edirectors to affi the corporate real of the company thereto. The Secretary said the agreemen had been approved by the Board of Trade. The resolution was then put and carried. Mr. M'NAY said there was another agreement laid before the last general meeting. The purport of it was to give the Stockton and Darlington Company the power of uran shares in the South Durham and Lancashire oion Railway, or pay them some fixed dividend not exceeding 6 per cent. per annum. Mr. HurTcSsoN then read a copy of the agreement referred to, after which a formal resolution was unanimously passed approving the agreement giving the option to this company at ant time to elect to pay to the shareholders in the outh Dur lam ana canshbire Union Railway a fixed dividendof 6 percent. perannum, or 20. for every 1001, in rominal valu2e of the share capital of the South Darham and Lancashire Union Railway Company. in lien of the payments provided for by the first-named agreement, and authorizing the directors to affix the common seal of the company thereto. A vote of thanks to the Chairman concluded the proceedings. BRISTOL AND SOUTEE WALES UNION. The first ordinary meeting of this company ws hed on Tuesday at Bristol, Mr. C. J. Thomas in the cha:. The SECrETARY read the report, which stated that it was now three years since the public meeting was held at which the company was initiated. Daring the whole of the intervening period circumstances had been exceedingly adverse to this as to overv other new railway undertaking. The directors had succeeded in obthining the support of miluentil members of the Great Western, the South Wales, the Monmouthshira, the Taff Vale, and the Severn and Wye boardt of direction, and of other geatlemen largely concerned in the manufacturing and mining interests of South Wales. Subsequently, with the aid of a few zealous canvassers, some additional subscriptions were obtained in BristoL The case preseated to PaRismeLt Was so strong that notwithstanding the preva!llng indisposition to sanction new railway undertakings, the Bill passed through all its stages with but little difficulty. Some opposition was offered from landowners and vested interests, and this, together with the inquiry instituted by the Lords of the Adcmiralty, added to the cost, but did not otherwise interfere with the passing of the Act. The capital account showed that 16,4621. has been received, and 7,5011 epended, leaving a balance of S,961Z. The directors were very desirous of proceeding promptly and fviorously with the work, and they had therefore made a call of t. per share, payable in twro instalments. The enDineer had reported that the line could he opened for 2pass-nger trai ac for 250,0031, TheCnAs.meAR, in moving the adoption of the report, expressed his regret that it should have fallen to them in times like thepresent to carry out the undertaking, which he believed was of vital importance to the prosperity of BristoL The interest of money was so high that it deterred person4s from helping them to the extent that was neoessary. He regretted that the Great Western Company had not taken up ehe line in the way he thought they ought to have done, but he honed w ith the help of the presenti shareholders and others that the directors wtould be able to prooeed with the works as soon aspossible, andwhen completed he had no doubt the undertaking would answer all their expectations. MIr. LAGIOrN, MY.P, seconded the motion for the adoption of the report, which was carried unaniously. esolutiions were passed appointing 12; direc2tor3 and two auditors, in accordance wvith the proviisioof the company's Act. A vote of thanks was passed to the 21 provisional dirao. tors for their services, and a similar vote to the CisirmLn conduded the proceedings. TAFF VALE. A special meeting of this company was held at Bristl oa Friday, Ir. J. Poole in the hair. The CHA&IRsxAs explained that the object of the meeting was to enablethe directors toraise aportion of the additional capital authorized by the Act of last session. It was nexessary they should provide increased accommodation for the traffic on the Lne. They would also have to submit to a reduction of their charges in accordance with the provislons of the Act. The directors regretted they had to apply to the shareholders for morney in the exist state of the money-market, but they had rIsol'e to ask them for no more than was absolutely neces3sry 'or present purpoes The amoen; which they propooed to raise was o0,000L in shares of 10. each, with 3 deposit of 51. per share. He concluded by moving a formal resolution authorizing thbe creation of D,000 shares of 101. each, to be offered rateably to the shareholders. Mr. Bursnx:r seconded the motion, and it was adopted. On the motion of the CaR AN, it ws agreed to convert the debenture bonds into stock, bearing a preferential rate of interest. The meetiag then separated. SPALDING AND HOLBEACH. It appears that the works on this line haove been resumed, and that no doubt is now entertsined with regard to the completion of the undertakdng, the progress of which has been for some time suspended. 'TRINIDAD.

OKXOBY-MARKBTanR,d CIPYINTELLTOBNCE. Saturday Eveni I ne absorption of Consols by the public steadily .continues, and, although the improvement yesterday was as much as three-quarters per cent., there was at one time to-day a further advance of like 3nagnitude. Consols for money, which closed last -evening at 89i, were first quoted 891 to 90, and after -ome few' variations they went to 904. The de-mand in the discount-market being stil extremely adcive, there was then a general disposition to obtain loans on stock for short periods, and 6 per cent. was freely offered without success. This momentary pressure checked the prevailing buoyancy, although it is seen that the largeness of the temporary adNances lately obtained upon stock must operate in favour of prices w hen ;that stock comes to be reclaimed, and a slight reaction occurred, sales being mnade at 904. Ultimately, howvever, there were buyera at that quotation. ~For the new account on the 7Tth of December tbe last transactions were at 90j. The circumstance that after the 7th of December Consols will be quoted with the Ij per cent. dividend off has had its usual influence in stimulating purchsasee. Bank Stock left off at 208 to 210; Reduced, &)i to i; Newv Three per 'Oents. 89j to i; Indisa Stock, 210 to 212; India S'onds, 4Ss. discount; and Excchequer-bills, lSs, to e s. disCo'ntt. Monday, the 2d of November, being the day for the half-yearly balance at the Bank of England, the transfer offlces will be closed, and also the stock-Exchange. Business in the forel?n stock-market has been limited, but prices continue firm. Buenos Ayres -lave been negotiated at 82i ; Chilian Six per Cents., 102; Mexican, for the account, 19i; Russian Five per Cents., 100 ; ditto, Four-and-a-Ealf per -Cnts, 97j; SpanishDeferred, 25i; for theaccount, 2&; Turkish Six per Cents., 89i and 89; for the ac'ount, 88 and 89 ; ditto Four perCents.Guaranteed, -i8k aud i; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 64; snd the Dutch Four per Cent.

The rate of discount at Hamburg ha advanced to 4 The gold taken by the Arabia to New York Is -204,6821. The desmand for the Continent continues, oend about 96,0001. vwas withdrawn from the Bank today to pay for silver lately purchased. At the same time somne rather numerous parcels of sovereigns are taken for Ireland and Scotland. he Bank of England accounts are therefore not likely to present any encouraging features during the next week or two. The conviction, however, seems universal ihat it is only the immediate prospect that need be *Tegarded with anxiety, and that even if an increase -of pressure should be threatened for the moment a saonth can scarcely elapse without the commenceanent of a course of restoration. Confidence at Liverpool and Manchester and in -he manufacturing districts generally is still upheld in a mnanner to excite Esurprise. The apprehension -of further banking difficulties has greatly subsided, -and the stoppage of the Borough Bank has been followed by much less excitement than might have teen feared, looking at the large amount of its deposits and general liabilities. From the system of management which, it is alleged, will be -developee. whenever a full inquiry is made by the hareholders it will probably be found .that the fact -of the extinction of this institution, if it had happened at a time free from a tendency to alarm, could not have been regarded as a public misfortune. The .course of the Bank of England in connexion -with the attempts made to sustain it is admitted on all -ides to have been perfectly clear and strictly in -accordance with sound principle. The terms on,which aid would be granted were distinctly stated, and were never varied; but It seems that the parties negotiating on behalf of the Borough Bank were too -anguine as to their ability to comply with them. nnexed is a table of the fluctuations in stocks -and shares during the month of October. The range -of Consola has been unusually extensive, showing a -difference of 4 per cent. between the highest and lowest prlces, although at the conclusion the markcet has returned to the precise position in which it stood at the commencement. The persevering ln-vestments of the public, which have been on the scale -commonly observable when Consols fall below 90, -coupled with the news of the taking of Delhi and -the consequent conviction that the Indian question is now reduced to one of reorganization instead of reconquest, have counteracted the effect of the -isters thrown upon us from the American criBis, the further reduction of nearly two millions in the IBank bullion, and the advance in the rate of dis-count to 8 per cent. In railway shares the fluctua-tiona have also been violent, and the rebound, ex'cept in a few cases, has not been equal to that in the funds. East Indian, however, have experienced a decided improvement:- FXVOTUATIONS Nr TU STOCK AND SHAME iAfK-S DUnIa THE MONTH o OCTOTIXlt. 1s7_ On the Paris Bourse the fluct6tions of the month have been less extensive, but the heaviness has been mnore permanent, a fall having been established of -riper cent., notwithstanding the report of the Finance Minister announcing an estimated surplus of 1,920,0001. in the budget of 1859, of whlch 1,600,00014 is to be applied to the Sinklng Fund, and that the future issue of railway bonds will be ;retricted under regulations between the companies, -the Bank of France, and the Government. The principal railway meetings of the week have been of Indian lines :-At the East Indian it was stated that in consequence of the great exertions ande by the officers of the undertaking the damage -to the works on account of the outbreak had been nuch less than was originally expected. The chief loss was upon the workshops and stations destroyed at Allahabad and Cawupore. The pr.gre- s of the line baa been necessarily delayed by the present disturbances, and also from circumstances arising out of the Santhal rebellion. The net revenue for the present year is estimated at more than 6k per cent. upon the capital expended. The cost of completing the whole railway to Delhi wiU be about 11,000,0001., instead of 15,000,0001., as oiginally estimated. At a meeting of the Great Indian Peninsula it was announced that recent -events have but slightly interfered with the company's operations. At present 88 miles are open for -cafo, and in the spring 104 miles will be ready on the South-Eastern Extension. The cost of the portion open has been about 8,8001. per mnile, and the receipts show a profit equal to 41. 17s. per cen. The present balance of the shareholders' capital In -the treasury of the East India Company amounts to 1,007,8491. The report of the directors of the Demerara states that the fidlare of Mr. Manifold -their late manager, has been productive of the mos't sastrous results. The rolling stock and permanent way have been much negelected, and are now in a very bad state. The gross receipts for the halfyear ending the 29th of August show an increase of 2,048. over the corresponding period of 1850. The Colonial Legislature have expressed their willingness to aist the company by guarantee.. ing Intereet on the capital required to liquidate the mortgage to the colony, to discharge all debts and liabilities, to extend the railway to Machiaca, and -to put the whole line, plant, &c., in thorough workSng condition. It is intentded to rse 200,0001. 'TXe dividend of the Peebles is at the rate of 2i Iper cent., being lower than the distribution last .year. A new line of railway Is proposed from West Hartlepool to Guisborough to faeilitate -the communication between the former town and the Cleveland Ionfield. A public meeting et Eawick have rolved to support the North British chee for a line between 16wick and Carlide im -pfefereuce to the opposition project of the Caledo, iilais. The dividend declared at the Deeside meeb. Ing was at the zate of 6 per cent. The traffic continues to ihow a satisfactory inreo, and the zworkbng eapaes are below those of lat year. The Bill for the extension to Aboyne has received the Royal assent, and contracts have beena entered into for the construction of the line. Subjoined are the railwav calls for November, so far as thev have vet been idVerfi%,.d !_ The communication by submarine cable between Spartivento (Sardinia) and Bona, in Algeria, has at length been established. Messrs. Newall and Co., the contractors, are nowr about to lay the cables between Cagliari and Malta, and between Malta and Corfu, and with good weather it is hoped the operations may be completed in a fortnight. The shipping return4 of theBoard of Trade for the past month show an increase in the employment of all kinds of vessels, except American, the businems of the latter having been affected by the commencement of the panic. Annexed are the general totals:- Entered inward With regard to the coasting trade it appears that the tonnage entered inward was 1,079,430 in September, 1855, and 1,082,775 in 1856, while In the present return it is 1,123,905 (including 7,239 foreign). The clearances outward were-],170,728 in September, 1855; 1,181,435in1856, and 1,244,M48 (including 3,914 foreign) in 1857. A meeting of creditors of Messrs. Thornton, T1iggins, Ward, and Co., whose suspension was announced on the 28th, wan held yeBterday at Manchester, and a composition of 15S. in the pound was accepted, payable in three half-yearly mnstalmexits.

Congress had at the date of Mr. Whitehead's letter not yet opened its Bessions, but it was then expeoted It would do so in a fevv days. The Ministers had on the installation of the President, as a matter of official etiquette and duty, tendered their resignaation, but no new appointments would be made till after the installation of the CoDgress." The sDecde by La Plata yesterday waa written 999,0001. instead of dollars. In the column reporting the arrival of the vessel the sumi was correctly Btated, namely 200,1731. sterling. The annexed information regarding the mining business of the week is condensed from the Mining Journal:- "The mining-market this week has partaken of the general dulness to a greater extent than before, and when sales have been pressed prices have given way and lower quotations given. At Wheal Clifford meeting the accounts shovred a balance in favour of the mine of 1,118.; the profit on the two months' working was 7201.; a dividend of 7501. t3L per share) was declared and 3681. carried to the next account.

The following on the linen m3anufacture of Great Britain is from a circular of Meesr. Dewar ancd Sons " To thoee engaged in the linen trade the present abate of affairs in the United States is of the utmost interest, as that country forms one of our best markets. It cannot therefore be surprising that the present panic should be followed by very considerably diminished exports and a generally depressive tendency. Still, as our exports to other countLies proceed steadily, and as the home trade has as yet been but ittle affected, it is hoped that, with ordinary cattion, by the thme affairs have resumed a more healthy state, no very serious results will have taken place. " At the present moment some notice of the progress of the British linen trae may be of interest. There are no data upon which a perfectly correct estimate can be formed as to the extent of oar home consumption. In 1800 the capital invested did not exoed 2,000,000l1, while at the present time It cannot be less than 15,O000,GOO., givingemployment to about 150,000 persons. Some idea may therefore be formed of the relative importance of this trade as compared with other manufacturing interests. Our export trade, in the face of maany difficulties, has steadily increased from 2,992,1431. In 1835, to 4,096,36. in 1845, and 5,057,507 in 15 Out of the exorts for 1855 the United States took to the value, of 1,884,1131. It Is Important to observe that the exports through the Hanse Towns to Germany amounted in the same year to 562,1461., proving our ability to compete successfully in their own markets with those who have hitherto been so celebrated in linen manu- "The high state of perfection the linen manufacture of I this country has sow attained enables us to compete successfully with the world.

STATE OP TRADE. eMANCESTER, OcT. 31. The depression of trade is making itself felt very severely upon the working classes, not excepting the more highly poid servants of our city mercantile establishnments. One howe alone has dismissed 30 of its salesmen, clerks, and warehousemen, and numerous others are reported to have taken similar measures indicative of a necessity for economy corresponding with the restricted bujiness. It would be difficult to form an e3timate of the still greater extent of suffering among the mill operatives, resulting from the unexpected commercial crisis which has oyertaken us. Not only in Manchester have great numbers of working peoole lets partially r antirely thrown out of employment by the stoppage of mills or the resort to short time, but the sarrounding towns are some of them feeling the depression of trade still more acutely. The silk trade at Msclesfield is, perhaps, in a still rworse state; but in Ashton, Stalybridge, Stoukport, Bury, Bolton, Darwe, Blackburn, Preston, Eochdale, Oldhann, and other large towns in the cotton districts distress has manifested tself wdely already and led to an increase oEf aunerism. At rreston twe whole or the operatives ia more than a dozen cotton miUs have been thrown out of employ by an entire stoppage, while about 30 mills there are running only three and four days per week. At all the plaoes above enumerated miUs have entirely stopped or have redaced their production very consrderably, and -with it the employment of the working classes. The meams of reducing production has assumed a different shape in some places from what it has in others, and while in some the machinery runs only from daylight to dark, in others looms ha-e been thrown out of gear, and weavers lately having charge of three have now only one or two. Nothing that could be said of the state of onr marketcould speakmore forcibly than these fact do of the severe pressure put upon trade within the last few weeks by the adverse comumercial news from America and elsewhere. Prices continue to give way in most deEcriptions of yarn and cloth, and it is difficult to give quotations frotn the extreme irregularity prevailing, which will probably continue until the causes for Alarm have passd away sufficiently to induce aresumption of business on a scale more nealy commensuate with the productiYC power of the ditict. t the meetirg of the creditors of Mesr Thornton, Huggins, and Co., held yesterday, the result of which was stated in Thme TImnc of this morning, the following was the statement of affairs presented by The accountant:- Dr C B. d.

BIRMINGHAM, OcT. 3L The state of the South Staffordshire iron trade is steady, and, although somewhat dull in consequence of American disasters and the state of the money-nmrketk there is a fair demand for manufactured iron for home consumption. Forced sales -have been in some istances effected for cash at reduced rates, but generally prices havo been well maintained. It Is stated that one or two houses hold acceptances falling due upon the Liverpool Borough Bank, but that They have received intimation that they vwill be duly met as they arrive at maturity. Generally The monetary crisis has hitnerto producedless injurious effects upon the iron trade of these district3 than might have been expected, but it cannot be concealed tat considerable apprehensios csare entertained for the future The iron-founders of the disrict although moderately well employed, are by no means active. Old contracts for the construction of pub3lc works keep the large establishments fairly engaged, but few new orders of any importance have recently been received. There is a consideraMble order in thenelghbourhoodforgeneralironmongery and hardware for Xadras, but, in consequence of the present unsettled shte of the presidency, its execution for the present has been postponed. There is almost an entire suspenson of business svth America. and manufacturers advertise that goods retund upon their hands destined for that market are now offered for sale at reduced prinoe. One American house in the town, somewhat extensively engaged in the Tranatlmtic trade, has countermanded all the orders which it had given out, but which were not commynced, and this has been followed by other minor esta. blihments doing business with thie United States. 'he general manufacturing trades of the toln,as a matter of course, sympathize wiffth e condition of the American firms, who are among thelr best cutomers. The brassfounders, however.make few complaints, and, notwithstanding the unsettled state of the metal-mrket, are doing an averwae amount of work. The best demand for some descriptions of bras and copper goods is from the continent, but at home shortness of stocks required for the winter trade compels the lronmongera and braziers to order more frey than during the mmmer months. In consequence of another expected fall in the price of copper, the manufacturers are, however, slow to purchase metal, and few of them are maldng for stock. The manufacture of tinware is particularly affected by the saspension of exports to India and North America and the unsettled prioes of material We lst week announced a reduction of -. in -the price of common blocks, and yesterday there was another fall of 61., with a corresponding reduction upon all qualities The foDowing are now the decared prices in Birminham :-Common blocks, 129b. 6. per cwt.* ingots, 130s.; bcrs, 131,s. 6d.; refined blocks, 1 2&. 6d. refined ingots$ 133s.- tinpiate grain ditto, I3Is. 6d.; and fine granulated, 14s Gd. This material redction in the price of tin it is hoped will have a favoarable effect upoon the manufacture of wares, and in some measure at least tend to modify the evil resulting from the present paudty of foreign orders. The factors represent that the country trade generally is not over brilk, but still there is little reason for complaint. Trade is generally in a healthy oondition, and Birmingham has recently suffered less from bad accounts than for some years pas The chief fallig offin the demand for Birmingham goods has been exDerienced by the jeweRers and japanners. The heavy steel toy business is at the present time somewhat slack, but this may be expected at the present tme of the year, when building operations, in worls connected with which they are used, are gradnally becoming more contracted. Commerdal travellers on jonuneys speak less hopefully of the Birmingham trade in Yorkshire and LIancashire than in other parts of the country, while the reports from the agricultural districtsare generally satisactory. Perhaps, however, the best proof which can be adduced as to the comparatively prosperous state of the country trade is the continued increase in The traic receipts of railway and canal companies. The London and North-Western notrithstanding the forced competition into which it has been obliged to enter with the Great Western for the traic of these districts, is carring more goods than ever, while the canal com2panies of the neighbourhoodi congratulate themselves upon increased tonnagesc At Bedditch the needle m anufacture continues dull, an, orders in the nail trade of Dudley and the nelghbourhoodowing to causes to which we have shready referred, gra dnal2y diminish. NOTTINGHAM, Ocr. 3L The dulness whlch has pervaded the lace trade for some weekspast continues. There has been a trifling amount of business doing this week for the home market. In most branches, however, trade is exceedingly flat. The latest news from the United States being of a rather more encouraginJg nature, and affairs in India bing more satisfactorit isto behoped fhat erel1oDaboth these msrketswrill be in a more healthystate to do business. The house of Caporn, Lscedealer of thstown, has supended payment. The liabilities are said to be about 20,000', and some of our manufEacturers are creditors. China silks continue easier to buy, more particularly the cheaper dass of material. Yarns are unsteady, without muc,h lteration in price. In hosiery there is very little doing, more particularly as respects articles for foreign consumption; the home trade is quiet. ru hosiery material there is not much alteration. 3Ianu. facturers of both lace and hosiery are keeping down stocks The NoUingh7sr Joturnal of yesterday has some excellent remarks respectigthe staple trades of the town, in the course of which the wrriter (in alluding to the present state of trade here) says,- "Recent events seemn to call upon us to step out of our usl comae to make a few observations upon the mode of doing business which the spirit of speculation, or the haste to become rich, or some other less justiable motives have Imported into the dealings of, we fear, too many of our neighbours. We have lately witnessed men of intelligenoe anrd active habits commencing and rapidly building up large business operations, reaching, after the lapse of a comparatively short period of time, to hundreds of thousands of pounds in the Year, with very little capital in money, asnd less, perhaps, In princple. The result of some of these energetSc or neck-or nothing proceedngs has just shown itself iearful collapse in more casei than one; and the more steady, but unfortunately too confiding, among our manufacturers have been sufferars to a large and very unusual extent. It is mach to be regretted that the spirit of competition has been too readily listened to, and has led too many into disaster and loss. The mode of doing business, particularly with American houses, will surely now bear the introduction of a little discretion and caution into It. Character without capital, or capital without character, wi not do. There must be an ample supy of both, and even when both are preen banuna prosporin aneems etuo h presenti m fun ProP(rt!ou an eYO must be kept upon the style and character of the buses itself. Another point which, in making A clean breast of it, we fedA called upon to notice is the introduction of frauds in measurement and quantity wichlargelypreveiinlweXan3otions ears informed upon credible authority that so oommon have Utese impoitions become that figures have ceased in masy caws to exprese definite numbers; that 36 means only 30, or 24, or even 22, according as the rapadty of the seller shll diot&te; that the purchaer sacelr e expeds to reoeive the quantity whieh he ostensibly buys ; and that m large mercantile houses expend a coniderable sum anually in ressurng the goods they have bought, in order to ascertain the quantity they actually receive and of hewr inuclk they have been virtaly dfruded. Aother mode oi obtinirng a cosmexion and buSIness is exposed in a corrpondenee which puear i o anoether pert of oulr presn nurmber, where a fiirm secretly offers a buyer conmneced with a large lace house a percentage upon cll goods bought of them suitable for his employers t ii not to be expected that the case now- bronght to light is the first a'tempt that has been made to tamper with the integrity of the buyers for mercantile houses, nor is it to be assumed that buyers bave always been proof, as in this instance, against the blandishments of their temptors. No doubt irregular and disreputable iaduences are frequently broaght to bear upon them, and many unfal and dishonest transactions t4ke place in causequence of these covert aois of bribery. This is a sides cogne of delinquencies to bring before the public. We should rejoice most heartily if tbere were no foundation for the charges it contitns. There s, however, too much foundation of truth in it. It has given us meuh pleasere to witness the rapid alvance in extent whic'hthe trade of Nottingham has made within the last ten years. We are as sincerely desirous a any one that that prosperity should grow a-nd increase; but any amount of succe3s would be dearly bought that was founded in any measure upon fraud, peculation, dishonesty, or any disreputable means whataoever. It is only upon the foundation of plain, untinselled honesty that a sound and enduring superstructure of prosperity can be securely built May this principle be the guiding star of the busy hiveg around us, and may their sucmess be proportionate to the extent in which it provails." LEICESTER, OcT. 3L The hosiery trade continues in a healthy state, although, orders having been countermanded, employment is becommngsca-ce. The commercdal panic in America has an influence upon trade here, but every means is being adopted to meet the difficulty with as little loss as possible There is a fair amount of business doing by the country house Yarns are without alteration in price, bet worsted spinners donotpushsales. The wool-marketisflat. NORWICE, OcT. 3L The gloom which pervadea the manuacturingiAidtcts In aoDsequence of the tightness of the mnoney-market and th8 unsettled aspect of public affairs has extended itself to this city during the last week or so. The number of unemplov. d weavers is oonsiderable at presant, but hoDpesare entertained that an improvement will take place in the course of a few weeks, when orders rill be given out for the spring trade. The shoe trade oontinues steady, and some of the best gocds are now made in the city. The number of Rersomn empoloye in Norwich in this branch of the national industry is est:mated at 6,000, and the London, Norwich. and Northampton Boot and Shoe Company are alone sid to be paying 2,0004 per week in wages. LEEDS, Ocr. 3L The general tone of the woollen cloth trde, in commonl 'with that of most of the textiLe manufactures, is one of flat. ness; but it is satsfactory to know that there s nothing approaching to a commereal panic in this district, which is mainch less affected by the Trnsatlantic failures than either the cotton or the worsted districh& Another wleek hz passed over without failure of conaeuenoe in this locality, nor, so far sz is known. are an- of the manufacturers Gr merchants seriously involved in the mspexnion or stoppgae of any distant firm. If even the arngement propoeda by Messrs. Thornton, HuQgglu, Ward, an Ca, American comn mission merchants, Buddeasfield and 3Ianchester, and gene. rally accepted by thelr creditors-namel~y, to pay 15s in ther pound by instaments-hould not be carried out to its full ettent, the loES suffered from that house ill n,ot be very great in Leeds The opinion of the local kersand the mos competent judges here is that the staple trade of thig district is sound, and that all the great firma will entsnue to meet all demands upon them. With a declen. sion in the demand by the merchants both for the home and the foreign trades, there is mruch caution used by the manufacturers not to overstock the markets. Henoe there is a good deal of short-time working, which reduces the wages of the operatives in the mills, Happily the prLca of bread is at a comparatively low figure, and many of the woriDng classes have prudentially saved smuall sums in their recent days of prosperity, so that as yet there is nothing like want or duress experienoed, exoept by the aged, the sick, or the dissolute. There are oly 28 more paupers of all inds in receipt of relief this weelk in Leeds than there waere inthe corresponding week of last year. It is fortunate that the depression in the woollen trade does not extend in an equal degree to the flax, iron, and leather trades, which in Leeds employ a very great number of hand. In the cloth-halls to-day the attendance of buyers was beow an average, as was also the amount of their purchases. The season being very open and comparatively warm, winter garments are not generally worn yet, so that drapers and tailors cannot get off their winter class of goods. Still a few parcels of heavy cloths and mixtures for winter use 'Were sold to"day, at rome abatement from late p rices Indeed, prices generay are scy so frm, and It is expected that those of wool will now decline perhaps to the extent of lid or 2dL per lb. Everything however, depends lpou the general aspect which trade may assumne at home and abrod A general Improvement, even in a slight degree, will keep wools at their presen rates, for it is admitted that the supplv, or rate of production, is not at all in excess of the consumpton. While the markets are slack and the trade at the warehouseis below the usual average a. this season, Itscheering to find that a good spring trade is generally anticipated, especially should fairs bot in India and America improve. HALITAX, Oar. 31. Sbort-time working has imcresed here in the worsed trade, and both yans and plae goods arlsold in smaLer quantities, buyers operating with great caution. Wools are a shade lower in price, but not much doing in them. BRADFORD, Ocr. 3L Business in all departments of the worsted trade reis paralyzed under the existing state of things, nor are there any symptoms of Immediate improvement. There is V generAl disposition to abstaini from entering into new en. gagements at present. In wools hadly any sales have taken place in the mark6t this week. The same may be said with regard to worsted yarns, in which all o?erations of importance are for the moment suspended. Noffs and brokes are In less request, and the trade in these descritions of wools partakes of the dulnem that pervades the market generaUly. The pices of some numbers of cotton yams, particularly 90's double yarns and below, have declined to the extent of fully 2a. per pound as compared with the late extreme rates; but the amount of business done has been altogether iconsiderable. Some small orders for goods have been given out this week, and, notwithstandingthelimited extent of these orders, they have been accepted at lower prices than have ruled for some time past. On the last market-day the attendanco of merchantsewas small, and there was less in even than usuaL The demand for goods for America almost entirely ceased, and the requirements for the fal trade, on the part of both home and shipping houses, have been nearly satisfied. As a mnatter of course, therefore, any further transactions which take pla cewillbe principally for goods required for the commenoement of next year, sad merchants who have orders are holding them back under the impression that they may be able to plaoe them on more favourable. terms than they casu now do. Short-time working having becomegeneral, the stocksuofnarns andgoods re increasing only st'ghtly, and, as they were very low before the pro. sent period of depression set -n the market IS likely to ba beter supptrted vhenever anything like an active demsan does sprmig up. The circumstances ounder whoic-h some firms connecte with this and the neighbouring mareits have recent! scd pended payment, and succeeded in making composritons N with their creditors, hove been much disussed irso ommer |Clal circles here, and have tended grealy to increase Irthe unpopularity of the present bankruptcy laws among the principal merchais, manufacturers, and Aders. st is said that the existing law of bankruptcy actualys holds cuts premium to dishonesty. By way of ilustration the cse3 is puliof ronsto commen.e business as merchants without any capital, but who, being active, intelligent, and clever, and apparently honest, succeed i gaining credit tD the ex tent of many thousands of pounds upon the presumption that they are confinng theinselvesto legitimate trading. bat content wsing th this, howvetr, havig got possesion of large funds not their own, they make a bold stroke for a forte, enter into time brgains, speculate in merica stocks and shares and other tempting securities, wvhen suddenly crisis comes, and all at once they find themselves oblged to stop payment. The pena claues of the present bankruptcy laws, it is argued, are no terror to reckless specutors of thie description, who know that their creditors will accept a conpostion rat her than ke them bankrupts, seeing that if insolvent tes are wound un in tbe reslutioy Court one-half of the assets, or more thn referenceabsoed in the expenses of officials, lawyers, wa accountants. Hence the general feeling in favour ot a new, speedy, han cheap mode of winding up the estates of bank. rupts has besome stronger here tn the last fev weeks The Council of the Bradford Chamber of CommErce are moving in the matter, haing this w_eek appointd a, committee, consisting of the president (Mr. Titus Salt), the Mayors of Bradford and Halfa:c, Mr Whitworth, Mr. J. Y. Godwin, r. Aldermn Mitchell, and Mr. William Douglas, with the secretary, to attend especially to all matters relating to the amendment of 0cmr. mercial law, with instructions to select from the mnember of the commaittee two delegates to attend a meeting inlu-Br mingham on the 17th of l!iovember, in order to carry out the resolutions of the late Birmingham Conference wvith reference to the amendment of the banrptcy laws.

The effect of chort-time wor}ing has not yet been manzifested by any increased demand upon the funds of the Poor Iaw unions, but It is probable that it wll showr itself in a -reek or two. The guardians are anticipating this ; and one of the local boards (that of the North Bierley Union), holding its meetings in Bradford, has already inatructed its clerk to apply to the Poor La w Board in London for orders to relieve, at discretion, familles who have been thrown out of work, or are only in partial employment, by reason of the depresslonin trade.

ZO2TDOY iOD1?DA Y, NrOVEMBEB 2,1857. What is it that Englishmen fear most? The D.Yvm, some one will boldly say. Well! we don't knowwhether this answer is altogetherright, because, though we a,l fear and hate the DEVIL, many of us have carried our hate out to the uttermost. The perfection of hate means the annihilation and extinction of the hated object, and so some of us so hate the DEva that we have annihilated and extinguished him; fairly hated him out of his existence, and, in fact, do not believe in him or fear him at all. No I there is something we Englishmen .fear more than the DZvIL. In old times, so old as to seem almost beyond the Flood, we used to fear the French; and, when England had Admirals, NsEsON's advice to his sailors was " to " hate a Frenchman as they did the DEVIL ;" but, not to mention that the French are now our goodc allies, the comparison altogether fails in these degenerate times, because, as we have already observed, to many of us the DEVIL is a nonentity, owing to our excess of hatred, so that, if we are now to hate a Frenchman as we do the DErViL, we just end by neither hating nor fearing the French at all. A very dcairable result. Again, therefore, we are thrown back, and the question recurs,-What is it that Englishmen fear most? Why, they fear GOD, some one wRll say; we wish they did. They fear Death; but that is only to fear GOD in another shape. We wish they did. We wish they would show this wholesome fear in their lives rather than by throwing it on Death's broad shoulders. They fear the taxgatherer, and weU they may. :Dee.h only comes once, but the taxgatherer once a-quarter, and every time he has some new tax-paper in his hand. " Prompt pay" ment " or "instant execution" is the language in whlch he addresses his victim But there is something worse even than the taxgatherer. What is it? What can it be? Debt, or rather creditors ? Well, that is coming near it. To our mind, what Englishmen fear and hate more than the Dsvn., the French, Death, the taxgatherer, and .creditors, jointly or severally, one or all, is reeDonaibility, and they are right; for in point of fact responsibility, or the having to render an account for one's actions, having to answer for them, is nothing more than an anticipation of the Day of Judgment, and why hasten the advent of a time so terrible, wvhy not defer the great audit as long as possible? Still there are times and seasons when nations like individuals awaken, under some stroke of PRovIDEOc;, to a sense of their responsibility as accountable beings. There are occasions in national, as in domestic life, when the truth will come out, when the burden of responsibility will maake itself felt, in spite of a long course of indifference and carelessness, in spite of every attempt to " cook" the account and make things comofortable in the eyes of the world. Such a time and such a season in England's history is this Indian Mutiny, and such a sense of responsibility, such a desire to have an account, and to render an account, of our stewardship in that vast dependency, is that which now fills every English breast. Nor is this very moment, this actual day, unfitted for the solemn acceptance of a duty which can be evaded no longer. Before Delhi fell all eyes were turned on that accursed city, in expectation of speedy vengeance; we stood and gazed in breathless suspense to see our gallant countrymen leap from their trenches on those bloodstained walls, and plant their standards on the bulwarks and citadel of superstition and idolatry. It is done. Delhi ias fallen. Our wrongs are partially .avengeL. One instalment of justice haa been exacted with ample interest, and we have time to turn our eyes away from the capital of the Mogul dynastytime, in short, to breathe again. But before we leave this siege and return to our national responsibility we shall do well to remember that to each of us, in one sense, life is a perpetual siege, and that in this sense we all keep watch and ward before Delhi-before a fortress held by a bold and vig,ilant garrison, which we have helped to drill and discipline, and commanded by a consummate general. Compared with his lineage the dynasty of AuVuNzxsB iS as a thing of yesterday. The founder of this line was opposed to our first parents in Eden and gave them a signal defeat, issulng in a fell sortie from the fortress of his strength; that fortress, the human heart, he has continued to hold against a11 ADAM'S descendants to the present hour. Yes ! so long as we live we are always before Delhi, strangers and sojourners in a foreign land expecting succour and reinforcements from our Fathers' country, with yelling, merciless mutineers in front, and eager rebels all around us marching to raise the siege and intercept our supplies of grace and mercy. Woe to us if we do not endure until, by Gon's help, our leaguer, to which the " Tale of Troy Divine" is mere child's play, has a glorious end; but it will only end on the last day of our lives, when "cdeath shall be swallowed up in victory." But, to return to our responsibility as a nation. Elere we have had India more or less for a century; for so long we have held that pearl of great price, that precious gem, which all conquerors in all ages have dreamt of, and which so many have sought to grasp. And how have we governed it I Well! in a very paltry way. First as a purely commercial speculation by a Company of merchantsr; then, when this commercial speculation outgrew alL bounds, partly by the merchants and partly by the Eome Government; then, when we had almost Maten up but not more than half digested India, we enteredL upon the present strange arrangenent of what is called a double goverment ; in Ather words, by a splendid example of the great deadLock, in which as soon as any emergency arises all the wards are hampered and the key won't turn at al. Hlere, at home, we have the two establishments in dingy Leadenhall-street and beggarly Cannonrow, corresponding with and counteracting each other in every possible way, often from no perversity of intention, but from sheer absurdity of System. We have Boards of Directors and Boards of Control, and often a bundle of sticks on each; we have Committees and Secret Committees, and despatch-boxes! of which two or at most three people keep the key. From Leadenhall-street to Cannon-row, and from Cannon-row to Leadenhall-street, backwards and Eorwards pass these boxes, containing despatehes from India and despatches to India, of which it is hard to say which give most trouble-those from India, which no one at home can understand, or those for India, upon which no two persons at home can agree. We hear of strange dislikes, mysterious antipathies, obstinate vetos, exercised in the case of this or that statesman, or this or that General, for no good reason, by Directorial caprice or Ministerial incompetence. Such and much worse is the condition of our double government at home, a kind of hole-and-corner work, a constant game at " No child of mine, which consists in tossing Indian questions and affairs from the east to the west-end of London, and ends by shirking all responsibility whatever. Ahl! but in India things are much better managed, say our old Indians, now so busily engaged in rubbing up our " traditional policy" and giving it a bright face. Are they ? Let us see. " What " a glorious career is mine P" exdlaims a GovernorGeneral in the prime of life as he sets off on his journey East. "Eappy man that I am " to sway the destinies of the mild EUndoo, "guaided by the steady light of a traditional "policy." With the best intentions he repeats this lesson to himself until he lands at Caleutta, and arrives at Government-house. GovernorGeneral I He is no such thing; he is Governor-General in name, but in reality he is Governor-General " in Council,"-a very different matter. In Council his position is very much lile that of SAcHo PAixzA, when he entered on his government. He can do everything but just the very thing he wishes to do at the moment. That he can't do. Why ?-Because the Council must be with him. Well ! suppose the Council with him, can he do it then? Not at all! They make " a minuW' of it. A minute which lasts for years. Home goes the minute of the GovernorGeneral " in Council" to the India-house ; there it passes from box to box, the Chairman's box, this Committee's box, that Committee's box; then off to Oannon-row in MIr. VERNoN SMrTn's box; then duly docketed back to Leadenhall-street; back to Cannon-row, finally to appear as agreed upon or not in some Indian Budget speech dplivered to thirty members about the 1st of August at the fag end of the session, some two or three years after the special emergency in India which it was intended to solve has settled itself by the chapter of accidents or the rule of thumb. This is the ordinary way of transacting Indian business. Every one is waiting for every one else, and nothing comes of it. But as 150 millions of people spread over vast provinces cannot always be governed by the legitimate result of an equation represented by zero, there are times when the Governor-General, over-persuaded by the Council if he is a weak man, overpersuading them if he has any address, or openly setting them at defiance, and anapping his fingers at Council, Board of Directors, Board of Control and all, if he is obstinate and resolute, does aet. It is on these extraordinary occasions, and in this irregular way, that those acts of Govermnent are perfoi med which occasionally awtonish the world. This is how wars are made, States annexed, treaties concluded, and rigidly suppressed, until we hear that they have been violated in every particular. Paliament and the country knows nothing of thes thing%, or of the a, wb ledt9 themo until years have elapsed, until the Governor-General has returned, till an army has been lost or a rebellion arises. Then we rub our eyes, make an outcry, and btrive to throw the blame on some one. But, in truth, we are ourselves to blame for maintaining the farce of a double Government. For the individual acts, right or wrong, of each Governor-General, his best answer and excuse is-" Something had to be done, and, "as the existing system admits of no responsi"bility, I had to do it on my own. If you are "displeased, alter your systera, but do not blame "me, for you cannot govern a great -empire by a "system so nicely balanced that all its elements "are nonentities, and least of al suppose that "you can continue Lords Paramount in India if "you obstinately ignore your national respon" sibility."
By the death of General CAvA.GNAo it may with truth be said that France has met with a great loss; for misfortune is not always according to the immediate estimate of it, and though the former Chief of the Republic goes to the grave a mere private citizen, unregarded and almost forgotten, yet lis departure is like the quenching of a beacon whiich has in dangerous times directed the course of the State. Enough is known of the late General's life to render it almost unnecessary for us to recapitulate his services. The son of the CAVAIGNAC of the first revolution, he was bred up in and always adhered to those Republican principles which, in spite of any excesses to which they may have led in practice, are still cherished by numbers of the most enlightened and patriotic Fenchmen. Although by no means content -with the Government of LOUIS P}PPrE, he served his country gallantly in Africa, and gained in active warfare his claims to the rulership of amilitary nation. After the revolution of 1848 he was named a General and Minister of War by the Provisional Government, and to him fell, I in the succeeding June, the task of crushing the great insurrection of the Socialists. With what =ourage and resolution he acted is fresah in the memory of all. The greatest struggle that even I bhe streets of Paris have ever beheld terminated in the triumph of order after the slaughter of many thousands of the insurgents. For this-great service CAvAIGNAC was confirmed in his position as Chief of the State, and after the promulgation. of the Constitution he became a candidate for the Presidency of the Republic. The result. must have done much to shake his faith in his country and her fitness for the instititutions which it had been the dream of his lifebo establish. His opponent, Prince Louis NAPoEEON BONAPA}TE, was elected by an immense majority. Nor can it be asserted that the votes of I fhe great mass of Frenchmen were influenced, by, sny perception of the high qualities which the ?resent ExrpErao has since displayed. The sue memaful candidate owed his triumph partly o his name and partly to the belief hat he was a person of mild and inoffensivelabits, who would fill the President's chair Nithout holding the reins of power too tightly r checking the ambition of others. No smaU lumber, indeed, voted for him avowedly in order o overthrowv General CAvAiGNAC, who had so lately ,rushed their schemes of insurrection and procription. But whatever reasons controlled therote of Frane, General CAVAiGxAc not the less nade haste to obey it. Although the Chief o£ he State with absolute povwer, able to forf,d his rival's presence in France, able to leal with officials and to tamper with ballot)oxes, he acted, by the admission of all, openly md fairly. When the reslt was known he 5urrendered to hise rival the ,guardianship of the RZepublic, and retired into private life. After the *up-d'tat of 1851 he was imprisoned for a short aine, fronr a fear that he would resist the over1hn,w of the Constitution which had been formed inder his auspices. When it was found that France 'ad definitely aepted the new form of government ie was released, and did not appear on the political tiage til the present year, when he was elected ona. f the Deputies for Paris. It then became a question. vhether he would take the oath of allegiance to ,he Emrpmo, and his sudden death has forestalled ;he decision. He has passed away, and with him she hopes of some of the best and most highninded of Frenchmen. However, it seems likely that France as a nation niU be little affected by General CAvoAGNAC's death. Political honesty is not a showy quality. It appeals so a reflecting Class; time and experience are required to prove its dignity and value. It cannot iope to vie with audacity, ambition, and success. dn this country we are, indeed, accustomed toc denand of all our statesmen and soldiers respect for she law and for the principles of moral duty. We may find among them incapacity, or Sluggishness, Dr prejudice, but treachery and dishonesy, we may tay with pride, are unknown. English Generals returning, from the conquest of Indian monarchies or the liberation of European nations to private ife at home; English statesmen ruling the destinies of this great empire for years and leaving office poorer than they took it, to occupya back bench in the Commons, or to look after their corn and turnips,-these are types to which we are accustomed, and for which we have a traditional respect. But such men may in another community be considered spiritless and unenterprising. What we admaire as grandeur may be foolishness to our neighbours. Therefore, although the sudden death of General CAVAIGNAC and the excitement caused by his public funeral may have brought thousands together; though the old Liberal chiefs, the dynastic opposition auld the Republican opposition, may have gathered round his colfin; though the newspapers may render a tribute to his services and the garrisonx of Paris discharge volleys over his tomb, we must still think that his influence will be neither deep nor lasting. Admiration and affection come by sympathy, and cannot be extorted. A nation will only remember its representative men; and General CAVAIGNAd's lot fell in an age and among a people which have set little value on political consistency and constitutional forms. He may live in their remembrance as a gallant African chief, as the suppressor of a terrible insurrection ; but the civic virtue which laid down supreme power in obedience to a Constitution which few respected is hardly likely to give him a statue in the temple o0 Gallic fame. Yet we may compliment the French Goversment on the readiness with which it has done honour to the Generals memory. It is probable that, had not his widow acted so spirtedly and decisively, the remains would not have been brought to Paris at all, and the retirement of CAvAIGNAc's later life would have been followed by a provincial fumeral. But when the body was once in the capital the Govermment determined not to leave the last Ead duties in the hands of a private family or of political opponents. With the same promptness that was shown in the case of BEuNnGEn it decided that the funeral should take place at once; and, according:y, on Saturday last the remains of the late Chief of the State were consigned to the tomb. Tfhe troops he had once commanded were under arms, the friends who had surrounded bim at the tribune or the Council-chamaber emerge) from their obscurity to pay him the lbat honoura. The people were orderly and quiet, and, indeed, why should I they not be ? A gulf as of centuries divides thera I roM the dqys WhlXi YAI$4AQ bQCQ dUthoLJIy and from the political system which he fondly hoped to establish. If the Government had visions of a disturbance, it was an idle fear. A character like that of the dead man does not symbolize popular riot 'withouit an aim, a principle, or a chance of success. Nor were the friends who attended Mim to the tomb likely to excite a Parisian mob to violence. They are for the most part disenchanted, disappointed, sorrowing men. Their lives have been contemporary with the revolafionary period, and now their gray hairs and their withered hopes coincide with its close. All that they are likely to desire is freedom to live in quiet and to cherish in each other's society the memories of tlhe past. Why should not General CAvAaGNAs funeral pass through crowcded streets, his life a theme for journalists and hie qualities a subject of public eulogy for his friends ? He belongs to a past age, and represents -feelings that seem irrevocably gone. The throne of a Roman 0,EsAn had little to fear thouglh a bust of BBuTus should be carried in procession or schoolboys should dilate on the virtues of CATO.
A graphic and interesting letter of our Chinese correspondent gives us an insight into the present condition of the Celestial Empire. The glance reveals to us strange things,-an ancient civilization still holding its own amid the movement of the world and the storms of domestic rebellion; great worldly pro3perity coexisting with crimes vhich indicate thedepth of povertyandall the degradation which springs fiom it; a scientific agriculture, a system of inland navigation, an universal irrigation of the soil, commerce and manufactures, together with an utter stagnation of the intellect, and inability to adopt the discoveries of Europe, or to find 8 substitute in native inteligence. The description of that great country, with its hundreds of millions of soutls, its vast rivers flowing down from the heart of the old world through cities crowded to overflowing, its quays and ricejunks, its boat-inhabiting population, i-t& pcrsevering tea-growers and silL-growers, not to- speak of its strange and pedantic Mandarins, mist always be to us full of attraction. China shares with India the dim glories of antiquity and mystery. When we know them we have certainly solved the Asian enigma. Old Assyria, old Persia, old Arabia, have passed away, and are only to be studied on a block of gypsuma or in the sacred volumes of a sect. But the country in which we are now struggling for e7apire, and the country into which we meditate foreing an entrance, are in. most-respects the same to-day as when the other long dead nations were young. T'he half of the human race which they contain in the oldest and the most venerable relic of time. Statues of bronze or marble, seulptured rock fronts and sepulchral urns, cannot vie in antiquity with those quaint features, these singular garbs, and those immoveable, unchangeable institations. We need therefore no apology at any time for calling public- attention to the Chinese Empire; and the present moment, when British arns have once more asserted their claim to the emnpire of the East, in particudarly fitting for a eview of our relations- with the Celestial Monarch, his deputies, and his empire. Although China, hardly belongs to that great Asitie community of which Mussulmans and Hindeos form part, although the news of Indian victories- would hardly penetrate to Pekin as they would to Bokhara. or the Caueasus, yet we may believe that, the great outbreak and ik sluppression. will have an echo even in Mongol Asia. We may also look forward to. a, time -when our vast European army in the E-att will be disengaged, and when the disaffected or disbanded Sepoys 1wil be glad to clear themselves by volunteering fox a Chinese expedition. There can- then be no- harm in talking advantage of both, prestige ansd resources to carry out the plans- which our interest and the- interests of civilization have prompted. To. draw this ancient race- from its isolation, to open. tlhe colntry, to carry European arts an4- knowledge to its inmost provinces, is a seheme-wvhich will have the assent of every man of education3 while the benefits which will result to, out trade will enlist the sympathies of the politician, the manufacturer, and the merchant. It is- indeed' a great thing for the- world that this country sould find itself at the present time strog enough to urge the demands of civilization, and that when the internal troubles. of China give an. opportunity of offering our counsels the internal troubles of India should indirectly and in a providential manner endow us with the power of enforcing them. Why, indeed, should we not come- and go freely in China? On the answer to this question depends the whole plan of our proceedings. If the Chinese people were to a man fanatics and bigots, detesting the sight of a Christian, and determined to oppose his setting foot on tneir shores, then we should counsel a gradual and gentle removal of their prejudices. Our merchants should wsfine themselves to their factories, or at least demand only the right to visit certain specified spots. But we have ample proof that the Chinese have, no bigotry, and our correspondent says they have very little religion. They are sailors in our saips, and may be seen wandering about Wapping daily. They ecmigrate by thousands to Australia and California, to Singapore and the Mauritius. They keep restaurants in San Francisco and liquor-Etores in Melbourne. They not only buy aud sell, but eat and drink with us, and would probably pray with us if they could make anything by the tranmaction. In fact, they are an industrious, hard-fisted, acute, and most unprejudiced race, who, having remained in exactly the same intellectual state century after century, have within the last few years been roused by the electric inflenee of European culture, and are now ready to- yield to aBiiost any impulse. It follows, then, that our exclusion from the empire must be the result of political regulations, and this is undou6btedly the case. Isolation is merely a tradition. of the empire, and has no root in the feelings of the people. When our correspondent visited a city nwver before entered by an European, he found himself merely an object of curiosity. The people crowded round, staed, talked, and langhed, and were rather glad than otherwise to see ihe stranger. N owhere but at Canton, where a feud hlas long existed betveen the foreigners and the mob, is there the slightest antipathy to an Englishman or other Christian. Why, then, should we allow ourselves any longer to be excluded? . May we not represent to the EMznPson that his people come freely to our dominions, and express no jealoasy at our return| g the visit ; and, that being so, that we cannot. (onsent any longer to be debarred from the rigbh. cf freely traversing his territory ? This, we think, may bh represented to His CE.rsTiAr MAAESTY without menace, and quit in the sensible businesslike 3manner which a Chinaiman seemts so well able to appreciate. In fa= it -would not be out of plaee to commence 3aegotia- ions by ePni_-nciating the elementary principles of political economy. Monso instructed as the literary graduates, and so acute as the Shnghai teadealers, woould readily perceive that we English and Chinese are very useful to each other, and that the mutual benefits may be largely increased. As it is, China annually drains us of many millions sterling in silver; England drinks more tea than ever, and the whole world is beginning to take . a fancy to the same beverage. Of Shanghai out correspondent saYs, " Almost yesterdsy the site 'i o thi hand§QMe &1go-Chineu y wo4i day, " fields and cotton grounds. Yet, in 1856 im"ports from the whole,world to the amount of three "millions sterling passed through t.heCustom-hose, rand, in addition, opiumto thevalueof 4,624,3051. passed through this portal to the interior of "China. Yet, notwithstanding this amount of "legal and illegal imports, a further importation "of 4,287,9901. in hard bullion was requisite to "settle the balance, and to p^y for the enormous "amoumt of tea and silk which Shanghai dis"tributed to Europe, America, and Australia." This year, we are also told, the sum to be paid in silver will amount to 9,000,0001., even with the set-off of the opium, and, were it not for this illegally introduced product, we should actually have to send 14,000,0001. in specie to pay for the Chinese products shipped at this one port. With such facts as these an able negotiator may well be able to impress on the Chinese ruler that the oatside barbarians are neceFsary to Celestial prosperity, and that they may fairly count on just and generous treatment. It may be explained that the interest of China itselfdemands that our people should have free entry into th* country, and that our productions should be admitted at mora reasonable duties. At present the tarif of te empire is most scandalously protectionist. The Csatom-houses strike our cottons.and hardware with such heavy duties that the frugal natives, though thley admire our worlmanship,. cannot afford to buy our goods. It is not from any love of their om productions that they refuse those of Manchester or Birmingham, but simply because the duty is asTae three or four hundred per cent. on the value of the latter. This is proved by the fact that on the coast, ontside the cordon of Custom-houses, the people ae glad to take English. manufactures, while in the inland districts they put up with their own. lTow, Lord ELGxr might insist on demonstrating that this policy of the authorities is extremely unwise, and if persisted in mu6t seriously injure the trade between the tus empires. England eanot afford to go on paying- silver for al the tea she drinks. If the present drain of speoie continues a time must come when. the couumption of tea will begin to diminish, andl al but the rich will return to coffee and chocolate. The exporb of silk will lso suffer, andc the Chinese will have to keep their raw- material to make holyday suits for themselves. TIfacti China maay be informed that she is at present deriving a factitious prosperity by holding a monopoly of sarticles which the world is at present rich' enough to buy, but which in course of time it, wiT be tempted to abstain from or to produce fbr itself. The financial policy Of China must in the-end lead to a commercial catastrophe, just as her- 3ocial exclusiveness has resulted in internal rebellien, and the exasperation of her most powerfult neighbour. Now is the time for putting an; endu to both causes of complaint. England has- b;ees injured and insulted by the Governor of' n irmportant provinee, and to obtain redress the port of Canton has been btoekaded for the last 12 months. We I have the right to hold the EsPERrmtOn responsible for the act of his deputy, but the friendly feeling existing at the other ports- and the contiueance of commercial relations. make us unBviIg to push things- to an extsemity. Ie-ever, it is quite allowable to exact condition, and to turn the present opportunrty to good account. With temperanee, and yet with firmness, the British RIenipetentiary might point out that concession, toD the just demands of, eiv ization will be the- be* means of amerting, the' viit of a hostile fore..

THE UNITED STATES. (FRoM?r otB NYw yoI coRSPoN?PM) NEW YORK, OCT. 20. The revulsion which it has been my duty to chronicle for some tims past seems not to be confined to commercial and financial matters. The autumn elections show a still more overwhelming prostration of the late triumphant Republican party. Mr. Buchanan, for the time being, has it aU his own way, and wiU meet Congress strengthened already by a largely increased majority in Pennsylvania, and by a result in Ohio (a State that gave FremontI ih vote by a large majority) that is so doubtful as1 to depend upon the official count. The Republican States of the farther west have held to their faith by decreased majorities. The election in Kansas appears to have passed off quietly, and to have resulted adversely to the Administration. The Free State candidate is reported elected to Congress by a decided majority ; and, as many of the supporters of I the Administration candidate are also Free State men, we may regard the wounds of that " bleeding'? country as essentially staunched until oolitical purposes on one side or the other require them to gush forth anew. The healing outlet of the body politic must be transferred to some other quarter. We are as yet indebted exclusively to the telegraph for ibese results. It is possible that the mails may change their face. It is suggested by a morning journal that the present financial dilficulties will let loose a crop of Jilibustera to prey upon the South. England is advised to take them for India. In the lack of that it Is said that they will pour down upon the weak States of the sthmus and overpower them, and the Government will be forced into a war. I am inclined to think that there is some focundation for this hint, so far as the southern cities are concerned,-not that there is any apprehension of war, but that there is still a restless spirit let loose by the disorganization of industry, and threatening to give some trouble during the coming winter. The Government is sincere in its purpose of putting down this spirit,and so far as New York is concerned its agents express no doubt of their ability to do so. Whatever the State and city authorities may be (and they have shown themselves weak enough during the present year), the Federal Government is strong at this point, and able to suppress any filibustering movement. But in the southern towns it cannot act with equal vigour and despatch, and I should not be surprised if the movements on foot got some headway there in spite of Govermnent opposition. Since my last letter the panic has had some chance to subside, the frightened people to recover from their fears, the designing men to question the expediency of their movements, and the country at large to see the folly of a suspension of specie payments, when the exchanges throughout the world-gave a profit on the transmission of specieto New York. It was absolutely impossible on the day of suspension that the specie of New York could find its way out of the town, except by soume extraordinary operation unknown to trade. The European exchanges made remittances there impossible. The whole interior were largely indebted to New York. Remittances to any points there were therefore unlikely until the grain crop began to move. That was stationary, but confidence was only wanting here to set it in motion. That confidence was utterly gone here. No man believed in anything or anybody this day week. Yet even this complete distrust is insufficient to explain everything that took place. I wrote you last week that I had reason to think that it was the work of combination and design. Subsequent inquiries have confirmed that opinion. Not only were the country banks and the politicians concerned in bringing about the present state of things, but the New York dry goods mercbants also had a hand in it. I do not mean to say that, as a body, the merchants were parties to tampering with the credit of a community. I only mean to say that there was sufficient combination among the disaffected part of them, particularly the dry goodsmerchants, to materially aid in bringingabout the crisis. In the beginning of the panic the banks commenced a contraction, which in a single week reduced their loans $4,000,000, and increased their specie as much. There, in my judgment, it would have been the part of wisdom to stop. They knew that the heaviest payments of the year were maturin in October and November, and that to meet these payments it was absolutely necessary that confidence should be restored and maintained. They nmight have known that if they showed a want of confidence in the community, by contracting 'when increased accommodation was demanded, that want of confidence would react upon themaelves, who were the depositaries of the floating wealth of the trading world. They, or rather enough of them to control the a.tion of all, reasoned otherwise, and thought they could strengthen themselves at the expense of the merchants. The consequence was that excbange on New York in the agricultural districts became an impossibility. You can scarcely fancy such a state of things in England as the impossibility of remitting from Chicago to New York, yet it was so. I was shown yesterday, as an evidence of reviving vitality in exchanges, a remittance from an interior town in Illinois, not 100 miles from Chicago, and on the line of one of the railways, where the exchange upon Chicago was 21 per cent., and thene upon New York 10 per cent. And this vwith Chicago at this moment a debtor to New York, and millions of bushels of wheat laying there for shipment. The same thing existed at the South. I know of cases in southern seaboard cities where it has been impossible to remit so small a sum as 5001. In fact, the ordinary channels of commerce were suddenly choked up, and the New York merchants found themselves foreed to meet their obligations without a possibility of realizing their own bills receivable. In this state of things the banks continued to contract, until a very considerable portion of the mercantile community in despair agreed among themselves, as I am credibly informed, to withdraw their deposits in specie if relief was not afforded, so that the October and November payments could be met. The relief was denied, and the withdrawal began. There could of course be but one end to this. No bank, at least on this side of the Atlantic, has enough speoie in its vaults to respond to all its depositors. The moment this game was begun a suspension became inevitable. As soon as the suspension took place the question arose whether the offending banks were to be forced into immediate liquidation. The laws agaimst offending corporations are stringent and the remedies summary. Were the banks to be immediately shut up? the banking accommodation withdrawn ? the banking capital annihilated? and the whole connunity made bankrupt by being forced into immediate liquidation? The judges, in whom is placed the tremendous power of deciding these questions, met together, and, in the evening papers of the same day, announced their decision, which I enclose, in case you deem it of sufficient interest to merit publication. It practical effect is to allow the banks to go on affording accommodation in the currency of the day, the weaker ones to quietly go into liquidation, and the stronger ones to resume specie payments when Dracticable. The general opinion is that that cannot be done before next summer, when the crop shall be got in and [sent to market. It is right to note that this opinion is not concurred in by many able lawyers, and that there is some prospect that it wzill not be allowed to remain unquestioned.. I do not believe, however,. that the community will submit to be forced to all immediate liquidation. It is one of those evils which some way, either legal or iUegal, wil be found to prevent. The bank statement of the week shows again a great contraction. The figures are as follows *- Decrease in loans and discounts ... $4,671,743 Decrease in specie. ... ... 3;3,064 Decri ass In deposits ... ... 7,049,164 This large liquidation is partly owing to the suspen. sion on Tuesday last, when the specie line fell below $6,000,000, from which it has now risen to nearly $8,00O,000. It is mainly important, as showing that the banks continue their policy of contraction. The amount of liquidation already may be seen by referring to the statement of the 22d of August, the one immediately preceding the failure of the Ohio Life and Trust Company, and comparing the statement of to-day with it:- Aug. 22.-Loans and Discounts ... t 120.139,582 Odc. 17. . ,, ,,, - ,, ... 97,245,826 Decrease .2 ... ... $2,893,756 Aug 22,-Specie ... ... ... 10,097,178 Oct. 17 ,, ,, ,, ... 7,843,230 Decrease... .. . . $ 253,948 Aug. 22:-Dep'osits ... .... ... 89 364,046 .005417. ,, t. ,, , ... 52,894,623 'Derease. $ 36,469,423 There is no harnAony in the various bank dire- tions, althouah they act together as a body in the Clearing-house. It is therefore impossible at present to anticipate their fasture action, or even to judge what the autumn is to be. That it is to depend very much upon the action of the New York banks no one doubts. Those beat conversant with the subject think that bottom is reached, and that exchanges will soon be restored to a point where business can be done. There is a greater demand for sterling by this steamer than at any time since the panic begun. I cannot see hope for better things until domestic exchanges are restored so that the produce can be moved. ,Let that be done, and New York is well enough. The western merchants can then get gold to pay the farmers, the erops will move on, and New York will begin once more to receive its dues. It is said tbat the wheat is already moving. If so we have touebed bottom. But the effects of such a sudden overthrow, upon the credit of New York, npon the commerce of the country, upon the wealth of the interior, upon the values of property, and upon the national industry, must be marked and lasting. As yet it is mainly confined to Northern enterprize. But as it rebounds from Liverpool and Manchester, may it not strike a blow at the value of the great southern production, cheapen cotton, reduce the value of slaves, make the raising them for sale less profitable, and thus possibly produce a political effect of great consequence ? The revulsion has. had the further effect of depleting the iNational Treasury to such a point that the Government may find itself without funds before the expiration of the fiscal year. The whole amount oflbred for redemption of National Stocks was taken up in a few days. The state of the railroads under protest is not materially changed since my last letter. No movement has been made for the appointment of a receiver to any of them. I observe in the meetings held to further the New York and Erie loan a more moderate tone towards the retired officers, against whom, as stated in my last lettir, strong language was freely used. The language now used with reference to the past is much more moderate and, conciliatory, and promises more harmony of action. The heat of the excitement being over they probably find that they were, as most men are in such times, rather hasty. and illjuidged. The subscriptions to the new loan amount to about $600,000. Ponfidence is felt in the honesty and energy of the new management, but this is no time for pushing any new railway investment. Even terms so favourable as those offered by this company do not now tempt men to embark in speculation. Meanwhile the company move on very well, though under protest. Their acceptances are in the hands of the banks; their only other credcitors are their employgs; and there is no disposition felt to embarrass them, or prevent thenm frora availing themselves of any change that may talke place in the autumn.

LYCBUM THEATRE. The Rose of Costille has been performed three timesin Euccesdon to very large audiences, and the verdict on each occasion has been unanimously favourable. On Saturday night the enthusiasm was as great as on the evening cf the first reprsentation. Snocess in this instance Las bcen fairly earned. Mxr. Balfe deserves it for bestowing more than ordinary pains on the composition cf the mnusic, which is in many respects the best that has fallen from, his pen; the performers de. strve It, from the prima donna and conductor of the orchestra down to the subordinates, vocal and instraraental, all of whom evince a zealous determina*on to do their very best; and the management deserves it for having spared neither trouble nor expense to placs the opera on the stage in the most complete and effective manner. No English vork his ever been produced with greater care; and the public, as usual, is nct slow in acknowledging the efforts of those who have appealed to them in good faith, and left notbingunattemptedtomerit theirapprovaL If things go on thus the dream of a national English Opera need no longer be regarded as Utopian. MIss Louisa Pyne and Mr. Harrison have got together the best working company they could obtain, and, not content with the mere possession Qf competent "principals" (the rock upon which so many Aimilar undertakings split), they have been equally anxious to provide that without which no operatic entertainment can be wholly satisfactory-Ai4, a thoroughly efficient band and chorus, under the guidance of an able and experienced chief. In leaving to Mr. Alfred Mellon the entire control of this department the hanagers acted most judicioisly, The necesity of exceRlence in this; diection has too often been disregarded. It Is mevertheless of the highest import. anee; and no speculation (of the kind can ly claim to serions consideration when it is overlooked. Many uninitiated in such matters may feel puzzled to know how, after so short a preparation, every thing should go so sanoothly and with sach decislon, in a work, too, of such dimensions, where choral and concerted music bear so large a proportion to the rest-how every singer should appear so entirely at his ease upon the stage, and a general feeling of satisfaction be elicited from the beginning to the end of the performance, In explanation, howeVer. it is only requisite to polnt to Mr. Mellon and his orchestra, Where all is correct and steady in that department nothing but sheer negligence or incompetency can produce irrgularity before the footlamps. It is a truth not to be ignored,that the discipline of the lyrical stage is enforced from the orchestra. If we were to criticize the absurdities in which the story of the Rose of OastWe abound;, the platitude of its dilogue, and- the alternating twaddle and bombasb of its verse, we might write a column to lttle effect. Moreover, we sbould be unjust to Messrs. A. Harris and Falconer, the compilers, who may appeal to the sanction of a quarter of a century for perpetrations of the sort, and who for the most part have doneneither better nor worse than theie predecessors. Still, it is to be lamented that, while a Inusician can be found among us to write so clever and 'effective an opera, he should be compelled to waste his talent upon a loose translation of-one of the most-preposterous speimens of French dramatic manufacture. The Rose of Caotilte outdoes the Crown DiamondG in improbabilities, while it boasts none of the sparkling dialogue, stUIl less of the neatness of construction, for which that elegant emanation from M. Scribe's fancy is remarkable. It is the difference between a bad fairy tale and a good one. We al know that AL Scribe's Queen of Portugal is a myth; but seevwhat he does with her-how the imnprobabilities of his plot, through the mere force of their relation to each other, become probable, and how well the whole hangs together. Given the Queen of Portugal, with the incident of the false jewels, and the fable as AL Scribe has handled it may be accepted withoat protest. The case is very different with the Quieen of Leon and the Prince of Castille, who figure in the present very weak imitation of x. Scribe's ingenious fiction. Here we have double the materias and less thanisaf the dramatic significance. The story of the Muieteer of Toledo, however, is happily known to our play-going readers, and, without further allusion to it, we may pat to a much more agreeable subject-the music. In the overture Mr. Balfe has displayed his accustomed inexperience-in a style of writing where, it is true, only the greater masters have exoelled. The opening subject2 a bolero, is characterLstic and spirited, and there are other good points here and there; but the piece as a whole wants coherency. The curtain up, Mr. Balfe is in his element. The opening solo, chorus, anddance-"List to the gay caatanet"-is as pretty and as Spanuish as any of the lively melodies of Senor Iradier, -who has made so profitable a market out of the national tanes of his country. The same praise is due to the duet-" Your pardon, senors -charmingly given by the Xfisses Louisa and Susan Pjne (the Qaeen, and Donna Carmen her confi. dant), which, moreover, is very quaintly instrumented. The "scherzo" (so called) sung by the disguised Queen at the solicitation of her ,host (borrowed from the Rtoite de Seiilte-one of M>. Balfe's Parisian operas) is composed of a series of roulades of the utmost difficulty, which Miss Pyne executes with astonishing ease and finish. The commencement of this is more effective than the end, which contains a progression by no means vocal, and far more exciting to the singer than grateful to the hearer. The firt ballad of Manoel (the masquerading Prince)"CI am a simnple muleteer"-is also his beat ; the tune Is vigorous, and the accompaniment characteristic and clever. Mr. Harrison sings it famously, and smacks his whip to such good account that Mr. Wallworth-the representative of " mine host," for whose information the lay of the muleteer is delivered-is hardly to be envied his near proplnquity to the singer. This makes cne of the Jterootyped " encores," which arrest the progress of the opera to no purpose except that of fatiguing the more reasonable among the audience. The succeeding duet, between the Queen and Prince-" Dost thou fear me,"-has some very graceful passages, but is much too fragmentary in construction, although the excellent singimg and acting of Miss Pyne and Mr. Harrison renderfi' eminently effective. The trio in praise of wine (for Don Pedro and his fellow-conspirators) begins admirably, and is sustained with spirit to the end, the first motive, for the three in concert, being nevertheless much more genial and spontaneons thau the solos. It is capitally given by Messrs. Weiss (Don Pedro), Honey (Don Florio), and St. Albyn (Don Sallust). A well-written quartet follows after, in which the conspirators are struck 'by the strong resemblance of the supposed peasant to the Queen. In the middle of this comes a rondo in two verses-" 0 were I the Queen of Spain"-each verse terminating -ith a florid coda, in which the fluent vocalization of Miss Pyne is exhibitedto striking advantage. The melody of therondo is plaintive and touching, maidng the hearer carious to become more fully acquainted with the opera of lRtoie d-c Sevilc, from which-like the " scherzo' already mentioned-it is appropriated. The finale to the first act is bustling, dramatic, and effective. Nigtht draws on; the conspirators carry off the Queen, and leave the muleteer disconsolate; Eoldiers appear, with mountaineers bearing torches, to escort the travellers on their way; the dance and chorus of the psasants are resamed, and the curtain drops. The dramatic situation is suggestive, and is taken good advantage of by .lr. RAlfe, wbo hascombined the principals and subordinates in concerted music at once ingenious, graphic, and exctin - The second act begins ith a chorus of conspirators, which does not c1l for any remark. Nor is the baUad of Don Pedro-too great a soumdrel to elidcitsympathy-of any value, except, perhaps, to the publisher. " Though fortune dsxkly o'er me frowns" isa the sentimental style, and therefore (however well sang by Mr. Weiss) quite out of place in the month of DonPedro. Thescenein whichthe Qaeen first appears in state, and the conspirators are now confounded With her likenes to the peasant girl, begins with a vigorous acd wellwritten chorus founded on the principal theme of the overture. The ballad where the Queen recalls in sadness the days of her girlbood is surpassingly beautifuL ddr. Balfe never wrote more tenderly, nor could he have fonund a more expsressive interprete-. The "Convent Cell," vith Miss Pyne's exquWsite singingmelodious breathing it might almost be termed, iu scnh soft and subdued tones is the greater part of it delivered-is undoubtedly the *gem" of the opcera, Here no one cold possibly find Iauelt with the rapturous "encore" that ensues; such a performance, indeed, of musc so unaffectedly pathetic mnigbt movo even a stoic. The followving scene, consisting ot a romince, duet, trio, ad ahoras, is another genuine inspiration. The uleteer preteds to recognize in the Queen and her maid of honour the- peasants whom he had encountered In the previous act; but tbey, on their part, laugh at his presumed mistake. Here again the national Spanish melody is happily parodied and employed with consummate knowledge of dramatio propriety. Nothing more gay and sarkling, more pointed and quaintly ex. pressive, could have been written; while the spirlWd manner in whioh the whole scene is acted by the Misses Pyne and Mr. Harrison realizes the utmost e(sot of which it is capable. Another "encore" follows, as a master of course, and ope of which vetg few woud he likely to complain. The trio- " I'm not the Qaeen, hal ha.

Firiin her assumed character, she addreeses them in a style of rustic simplicity; next, putting on an air of dgnifie& authority, she declares, in emphatic and lIfty straine, LOW, if s4e were Qaeen, she would detect and punish trait,sos; then she resumes the air of the rustic; then ag. hanges her tone, to the evident uneasiness ot the conmspiratora; ad, finally, sets their minds at rest bs corce r,ore resorting to the homely phrase and msnne~v s her first appeiLL The whole is well conceived and fotibly .s5ustrated by the omposer -who h:as preserved the eoentrast behteen th~ tewo assumed mannersvery-cleverly, atdeaOimed I ontthedrematicideatoperfection.l' sisanother porta,ity of 'whiC5 both ina 'musical and hiatrlonic aen' is Psne ;makes the utmost. The finale to the scond, act, IikqctIIS t. the first, *is full f life and spirit. The action embodie5 the "pparezitly suiccessful plot of Don Pedro and his friends, who, as they believe, have cajoled the Queen7 into a nisrria~ge with; the .ituleeeer. The scenLe closes with appropriate h,tivites-an "Aive Maia" for female voi¢es behind the Ectuss, accownpanied by "merry peal of bell', bringing deus the curtain. The music which illustrates al thisis light aud unambitious, but never 9agi for one iustant-so that the interest of the scene and the stirrng character of theincidents are well sustained to the end. Thethird act begind with aballd of no great pretensions, in which Miss Susan Pyne, with considerable archnees, lets tbe audience into the secret that "Love's a naugbty boy." A duet follows between the same lady and Mr. Honey-where Donna Carmen, the Queen's confidante, and Don Florio, the usurper's agent, nakle conimon cause and agree to unite in the holy bonda of matrimony. This is zhe raaest piece of bond fide comic matic in the opera; and the genuine way in which it is both gung and aeted produces such an impressiou that, Lte as it comes in the evening, the audience are enlivened beyond measure, and express their approval in unqualified terrs. liss SuEan Pyne has always been noted as one of tbe veliestof Yo2uhreua; bht Mr. Honey is comparatively a new aspirant, andtheprogress heismalizg in hisprofe.sion is declared in a very rumi talkeable manner by his iEopet'onation of Don Florio. The zecitative and air for the Queen; " Oh joyous, happy -day," is chiefly remarkable as a bravura display, showing the astonishing facility of hiss Loulsa Pyne, and her command of every kind of vocal elaboration, to extraordinary advantage. This is the great executive triumph of our accomplished English songstress, and is further noticeable for the admirable manner in whieh abrillant and not veryaccoommoioating part for the clarinet is performed by a gentleman of the orchestra It creates, and naturally enough, enthusiasm without hounds. Three songs hilch come after this in due succession were evidently written "to order" rather thian from inspiration. Ig the first the Muleteer addresses the Queen after the super-sentimentl fashion, to the purpose that had Ehe mot imwaned hbim -prince in dlsgnise sh-e wold never hare ftened to his addresses-a fact of which the audience are made aware from the beginning.. In the second Don Pedro ,ve- vent, In o6btreperous tones, to the warlike spirit th5t moves him; in thethird the Muleteer throws off his 4- guise and declares himself " King (query Prince?) tf Castie." There is very little musieci snerit is any of these, although they are declaimed witlh becoring energy-tbe first and last by Mr. Harrison the second by Mr. Weiss. In the "sentimental" ballad 31r. Harrison exhibits a degree of feeling that conipletely wins the sympathies of the audience and a vociferous " encore" for the song. The finale to the third act terminates with a solo for the Queen, who pardons the conspiratorsin afew plaintive measures, and then glides onoe more into the florid refrain of the rondo (Act 1) already mentioned, to which the chorus sing an acCompaniment, brncging down the curtain amid appropriate strains of hilarity. This last involves another tax upon the exertions of the talented and seemingly untiring Miss Louisa Pyn. She performs it beroicallv, however; and even on Saturdiy Aiebt-when indulgence wvas asked for her by Mr. Brough, acting manager, on plea of indisposition-her very last notes were as clear, brilliant, and perfectly in tune as her first. If the ;?ose of Castille is not calculated to add to the fame already honourably acquired by Mr Balfe, it will at all events maintain it at its full he'ght. It contains several pieces equal, some few superior, to any he bas Written, and as a whole may fairly take ibs stand by the side ot the best of bis best operas. The great charm of the performance at the Lyceum T4eatra lieF, as we have alreadv hinted, in its completeness. Eves. body is perfect and everybody on the alert. Even the little part of Donna Beatrice, which our b,ief analysis of the music afforded us no occasion to mention, is played with as much ca by ltss Mary Atne Prescott as if it were oneo'f importance. All the rest is to match; and thus, whilo stronger companies as a whole have often appeared before the putblic, we remember no instance of any working more successfully in concert. Add to this whe fact that scenery, costumes, and all the stage accessori6s exhibit an equal amount of consideration on the part of the management, everything giving undeniable evidence of liberality and taste, and the sutccess of the Rose of CastlUe, vith itS merits as a musical composition anndthe remarkable singing of ifiss Louisa Pyne taken into consideration, can hardly afford matter for surprise.
THE BBAZILS. Commercial advices from Bahia, are to the 3d of October, and from Pernambuco to the 5th, beinga fortnight later than those previously received by the mail steamer Aledway. At Bahis the sugar-market was flatter, and sales had been on a limited scale, a few smalI lots only having changed hands at 3,500 per arroba browns, and 4,000 whites. Of coffee Arrivals had been unimportant, and prioes wer without alteration. Supplies of cocoa were coming inregularly, and sales had been effected at 7,800 to 8,100 per arroba, according to quality. About 200 bales of Maceio cotteon had been disposed- of in second hands at 8,000 per arroba; the article was in brUik demand and the price firm. For Bahias 600 to 800 reis per arroba 3more was demanded, but no sales had been effected lately. Dry hides were in demand, but dry salted comparatively neglected. Sales of tobacco had been effected, bat the exact price was kept secret-said :to be somethiing below 6,000 and 7,M 00per riroli; the aimbot dertainty of the failure of the crop caused prices to assume a ifrm appearance. Rum was without alteration. Good qualities of tapioca were scarce and in demand. Quotations of freights continued nominal and flat. In exchange transactions for the Petropolis steamer to an unimportant amount had been effected at 27id. 60 days, and latierly at 27id. Imports of jerked beef hid been heavy, and prices ruled from 5,800 to 6,400 per arroba, according to quality. No other transactIons of importance in relation to imports. Irish butter fetched 740rs. per lb.; candles, 620r per lb.'; cheese, best quality Dutch, 1,800, but sales unimportant. Stocks of codfish, on the 1st, amounted to 9,300 barrels, which were retailing in second hands at $15 per barrel. From Pernambuco the shipments of sugar since the commencement of the new crop, October the 1st, up to the date of advices, amounted to 962 tons, viz., 693 to the Channel for orders, 208 to Liverpool, and 161 to Buenos Ayres. The market closed withnout animation, and quotations were rominal, anid rather above the actual value, although low, and the general feeling was that prices vould have to be reduced s-ill more. Great unwillingness was shwon to purchase cotton largely, few orders being received for shipment, and buyers appearing to con. sider that prices in England were at their highest point, and could not be supported. On the spot thedemand bad been principally for long staple descriptions, which were purchased at S,80D per arroba.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENRB I - - FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) fA portion of the following F@peared in our second edi- pA}J.S, IFRIDAY, OcT. 30, 6 P.M. I M. Hatzfeldt, the Prusian Minister, arrived in Paris yesterday, but was at once invited to join the festivities at (ompiegne. I announced this morning the sudden death of General Cavaignac. That event has produced deep and universal regret, and even those who differ most from him in politics, except perhaps the remnant of the insurgents of June, 1849, have heard the tidings with the sincereat sorrow. His death, which was almost instantaneous, was owing to disease of the heart. It took place while he was out shooting on Wednesday evening, near Tours, where he was on a visit to M1. Gustave de Beaumont. The General was in the act of raising his gun to his shoulder, when he felt a weakness s uddenly creep over hih, and he had scarcely time to hand his gun to an attendant who stood by, when he fell to the earth and expired. The body was taken to the house of his host, M. de Beaumont. Madame Cavaignac, the vwife of the General, would not hear of the remains of her husband being interred elsewhere than in Paris. She placed the body in a carriage, and with the head Inher lap, and accompanied by General Cavaignac, the uncle of the deceased, and by her infant child, sheproceeded to the railroad station at Tours, and asked that a special train should be at once got ready. The demand wa at first refused; but on announcing who she was, and whose were the remains she guarded, it was forthwith complied with. The funeral obsequies wi take place to-imorrow, in the Church of St. Louis d'Antin, and the honoun due to the rank of the deceased as a general officer will be paid to him. It was rumoured that the Emperor would pay him still greater honours, from his having held the high office of Chief of the State in 1848. General Cavaignac only a few days ago completed his 55th year. The new Spanish Cabinet Is fortunate enough to have the approbation of the To6urnol des Debafs, which considers it as "implying the maintenance in Spain of constitutional government, and the triumph of a liberal and, at the same time, a conFervative policy." It eulogizes them so warmly that the Madrid folks may find some difficulty in recognizing them. The more obscure members of the Cabinet may be passed over in silence, but the two or three who are better knowndeservethataword should be said of them. " M. Martinez de la Rosa is too well known in Europe," says the DJbas, " to make it necessary to recount his claims to the position he occupies. We cannot but congratulate ourselves on seeing once more in power a man who has given so many and such consistent guarantees to the principles of order and liberty, and who has relndered hIs name illustrious in letters as in politics." The Dgbats, in speaking of the " consistUnt gua- I rantees to the principles of liberty, &o.," must have forgotten the zeal -with which Martinez de la Rosa I recently co-operated in the destruction of the chief " guarantee,"-the lioerty of the press. It must have forgotten the measures introduced by a person who, irrespective of party, is one of the most hated of the many political adventurers that Spain has been infested with for the last 30 yeas The Dgbats forgets the assistance given by Martinez de la Ross, as President of the Chamber of Deputles, to the odious measure of Nocedal, which crushed that to which Martinez de la Rosa owed the very moderate reputation he once claimed as a man of letters, and this act of ingratitude, advisedly and deliberately perpetrated, justifies those who regard him as a renegade. Martinez de la Rosa was the principal collaborateuir in the Bstatuto Be4l, which was the Consitution of Spain in 1835, and of which the rickety existence terminated in 1836. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1845, and, as I have said, recently President of the Congres. Of M. Mon's unquestionable merits as a finm. cier I have already spoken. He to intelligent and honest; rather indolent, but is capable of much in his sudden fits of energy. The Improvements he introduced into the system of collectingthetaxes were valuable; and he deserves every credit for thereforms, such as they were, which, through his instrumentality, modified the tari Hlis liberal and just notions on matters of finance do him credit. The Dgbats observes that the impost system of M. Mon occazioned "one of the most formidable of the SpanLish insurrections s" and that " General Armero and M. Mon, the only Ministers left at Madrid (the Court was at Barcelona), had to combat and repress the revolt." This is a mistake; there was no "formidable insurrection ;" there was nothing more than a passlve "demonstration" on the part of a number of the shopkeepers of the P'uerta del So], and a dozen streets or so, who kept their shops closed an entire day to avoid paying the taxes under the new system, which they considered bore particularly hard on them. Groups of men assemnbled in the Puerta del Sol, and the Governor of Madrid, with his stacl dispersed the mob. Mazzaredo, Minister of War, was also in Madrid. Some shots were fired, and two or three persons standing in the 'oalconles or doorways were wounded. A young man, a journeyman tailor, was tried by court-martial and shot, for flinging a tile at the Political Chief while in the aet of forcing open the shops. But beyond this the meute did not extend, and it was over in a day. As I am in the humour for criticism, permit me to notice a blunder of one of your moming contemporaries in a leading article on Spanish affairs It says:- "The large staff of young, ambitious, and turbulent Generals would ill brook his control and interference, and thwart him in every way. The Sanzes, the Mibasols, the P'airas, the Shelleys, the Cordovas, the Espeletas, thePezuelas, and scors of others, devoured with ambition and inflated with arrogance aud vanity, are not the men to remain at rest." The present Premier of the Spanish Cabinet need not fear being " thwarted" by General Shelley, for the simple reason that General Shelley has been dead the last three years, having fallen a victim to the cholera. The " Sanzes and Miraaols" would, J have no doubt, be very happy to be classed among the "young, ambitiou, and turbulent Generals.' Sanz is a good deal on the wintry side of 60, Mirasol about the same, and neither of them was ever notorious for 46turbulence." The Spanish army list contains no such name as Pair, and MM Mon and Armero may slumber securely onk the Ministerial benches if they have only Cordova and Espeleta to fear. If the New Ministers be competent men we may forgive the source from which they derive their edstence. The only cause for apprehension is, that the same capricious Influence which called them into life may upslet them any moment. m The following letter, dated Madrid the 26th, gives some further particulars on the subject:- " Balaverria owes his nomination to the ecret influeno at the Pale,-t was w heb same hand that overthrew Narvaez. The Vicalvarists are consoled at seeing SalAverria in the Cabi. 2net; he is entirely ignorant of the business of his depart. ment, and is placed in the Public Works to prevent him from giving high appointments to the Vicalvarists. What is the signification of the present Minitry? I will explain Ito yon. There are but two men of say poitical import. anee In it-Mon and Bermudez de Castro. They represent the Electoral Committee of 1852-3. That committee carried on an energetic warfare against the Ministries of Bravo Murnllo, Roncali, Llorente, Lersundi, Egana, and SaxtorluS6 It had for its President Narvaez, and for VIpresident O'Donnell, its principle was Par'iamenftrisfm, atd it de. nranded that Ministers should be chosen from theParliaen. tary m-jority. A Palace intrigue, as you know, gaiar etoredA .rTarvaez to power, and a simi intrigue has just upse him. The same influence ias set up the present Cabinet, but of which none of the men of the majority of the present Chamber form part. Martnez de la Rosa voted for Nocedal's Draconian law agains the press in the last Parliament; hut be has long ceased to take an active part in political life. Before the Minist was completed the soi- disant Parliamentary President, A&dmiral Armero, prorogued the Chamber to the 30th December. The Cabinet represents merely the Electoral Committee of 1853; neither the friends of Bravo Murillo, nor of Liorente, nor of S in Luis, nor of Narvaez have been named Ministers. Bermudez de Castro is In the Cabineb because Mon is afraid of this enfang tribe.

The funeral obmequies of General Cavaignac took place this day in the church of St. Louis d'Antin. The various detachments of the garison selected to pay the last military honours to the deceased began to move from their quarters at 11 o'clock, and shortly after that hour took up position in the Rue Caumartin and the other approaches to the churob. The detachments were taken from the 45th and 85th of the line, with a battalion of foot Chasseura; at their head rode General de la Charribre, with his staff. The corl6ge left the General's residence, 29 Rue de Londrea, at half-past 11, and reached the church a few minutes past 12. It was opened by a detachment of the Chasseurs of Vincennes, followed by two troops of Hussars, four companies of infantry carrving their colours, riddled wth shot and bearing the word " Se'oastopoL" The eagles surmounting themn were veiled with crape, and the drums were muffled in the same sable covering. Two mourning carriages followed for tee officiating clergyman and his assistants, and then came the hease, surmounted at each corner with tricoloured flags intenningled with lofty black plumes. The General' sword and military decorations were laid on a velvet cushion, which was borne after the chief mourner-General Cavaignac, the uncle of the deceased. The ends of the pall were held by MM. Goudchaux. Bastide, Guinaud, Bayard, and de Folnay. The friends of the deceased next followed-they were very numerous, and among themn were a few working nmen in their blouses; then came the General's private c arriage and eight mourning coaches. When the hearse tured into the Rue Causnartin from theRue St. Lazare, the cure of the church of St. Louis d'Antin, accompanied by his clergy, isued out in procession, and received the body at the church door, while a' funeral symphony was executed by the military bands. After the usual prayers at the entrance, the coffin was placed on the catafalque before the high altar, andthe military hat, sword, and star were depositedonacushionof blackvelvet by its Bide. Among the persons who stood by the catafalque were MM. Odier (fatber-in-law of the deceased), O'Dillon Barret, Dufaure ,Piscatori, Crhmieuz, and a considerable number of political and literary celebrities. Masn was celebrated by the cur6 of the pariah, and the solemn music was executed alternately by the choir and organ and the military band. The ceremony was performed throughout amid the profoundest attention. After the absoltution was pronounced the body was again placed in the hearse, and the cort6ge, preceded by a squadron of Hussars, and foLowed by the detachments of infantry already mentioned, moved from the church by the Rue Chausse6 d'Antin, Rue St.Lazare, and Rue deClichy, to the cemetery of Montmartre, the burial-plaoe of the family. The streets in the neighbourhood were crowded with people, and the windows of every house in the ChaussEe d'Antin, Rues St. Lazare, Victoire, Provence, Jonbert, St. Nicolas, Londres, Tivoll, and Clchy, from which even a slight glance could be got of the hearse, were thronged. A troop of the mounted Paris Guards, and several squads, of Sergents de Ville kept the passae clear, and their exertions prevented confusion in the narrow thoroughfares. All was conducted with order and regularity, though the crowd who accompanied the hearse to the gates of the cemetery could hardly be lean than 15,000. A small portion only of the cort6ge was admitted inside. Most of those forming it were well-dressed persons, apparently merchants and shopkeepers, who, no doubt, remembered witb gratltude the services rendered by the deceased General in June, 1849. There were not many of those unmistakeable characters who usmally swell the funerals of other political leaders, andc it was remarked that there were at least six times as many of the Republicanparty present at the funeral of Godfrey Cavaignac, the General'a brother} who died in Paris not long before the revolution of 1848. Every one expected to see an Imperial carriage in the train, but I oould perceive none. Ai the hearse passed slowly along every hat was raised, and the spectators often remained bareheaded until it was out of sght. When the coffin was deposited in the tomb and the prayers for the dead were recited, the troops fired over the grave of the departed soldier, and paid the other military honours usual on such occasions.

Rex. The regret felt at the death of General Cavaignac is, as I have already said, deep and universal. Nine yearsare nearly elapsed since he resigned into the hands of the National Assembly the dictatorial powers with which he was tredsiterthe terrible insurrection of June. It is but a shert space in the history of a nation, yet it seems almost a century, so great were the events which have oecurred sinoe Citizen Marrast stood up and announced, amid profound sllence, in an Asembly where turbulene was the rule and silence the exception that Citizen Louis Napoleon Bonaparte had obtained more than 5,500,000 suffrages and Cavaignac not 1,500,000, and dedlared that the former was the President of the new republic. we still vividly remember the dramatic incidents of that momentous day, when the first magistrate of the Republic rose in the tribune and swore to remain faithful to the " Democratic Republic one and indivisible, and to fulfil all the duties imposed by the constitution." The new President bore graceful and merited testhnony to the character of his unsuccessful competitor. In the short addrees he pronounced after taking the oaths he said, " The conduct ofthehon. General Cavaignac has beenworthyof the loyalty of his character, and of that sentiment of duty which is the first quality of the chief of a State." The Citizen Preuident, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, then descended from the tribune, and went straight to the bench on which General Cavaignar was sitting. He held out his hand; it was takent but afll could observe t hat this act of courey was but coldly returned. Cavaignac no donut believed that he had been treated with ingratitude by the people to whom he had rendered such signal service only six months previously. There was no ingratitude in their rejection of him as President of the Republic; the nation had had enough of Republicanr madness, and already learnt to despise and abhor many of those who, dreed in a little brief authority, had played such fantastic tricks. They were sick of the Republic, which even the honest Cavaignac could notlrender popular; and this electionr would have prolonged some time its feverish existence. It was not because the people loved Prince Louis Napoleon more, but that they loved the Republic less, that Cavaignac was excluded. General Eug&ne Cavaignac was born in Paris on the 15th of October, 1802. The family is said to be of Irish extraction, the name being originally Kavanagb. He was the son of Jean Baptiste Cavaignac, a memiber of the terrible Convention, and vho during the Reign of Terror acquired a reputation not, if al be true that is related of him, of a very enviable kind. He was the brother of Godfrey Cavalgnac, the Republican of 1830, aid wbo enjoyed a certain notoriety for his connexion with the RevolutionaryFsrtyin the earlyparbof the reign of Louis Philippe. He was at. an ealy age destined for the military profession, and ws a pupil of the College of St. Barbe, eatered the Polytechnic School in 1820, then transferred, with the rank of Lieutenant of Engineers, to the Ecole d'Application of Metz, and in 1824 was appointed to the 2d Regiment of Engineers. Eto as promotedt the rank of First-Lieutenant i n 1827; in 1828 he wvent through the campaiga of the More i az Second-Captaln, anl was promoted to full Captain in 1829. I is reg;ment was quartered at Arras (the birthplace oi Rtobespierre) on the breaking ont of the revolution of 1880, and Cavaignac was one of the first among his brother officers who declared for the new rfgrne. In 1831 he was at Metz, and signed tle project of the National Association. For ti act he as placed on half-pay, but was restored to the service in 1832 and sent with his regiment to Algeria Marshal Clausel then commanded the French army inAfrica and after the success obtained at Macara, in which affair Covaignactook part, returnedtoOran. Eeleft aFrenchganisonat Tlemcen, inthewesternextremity of Algeria, which was at a considerable distance from succour, and in the midst o£ the warlike tribes of the Eabyle.3. Cavaignac was appointed to the command of the garrison, and B00 picked men wAre left under his orders. This was in January, 1836, and from that period till May of the following year, when he was relieved, he gave proofs of great courage and of great resources of mind. HE repul the enemy on every occasion when they attacked him with far superior forces, and maintained his ground to the lIVt. On the 4th of April, 1838, his local rank of Chef de Bataillon was confirmed on the demand of Mara Bugeaud. in the summer of 1840 he was appointed to the command of the 3d Battalion of Zonaves, which was principally formed of the volunteers of Tlemcen. The bad state of his health compelled him to return to France, when, at his own request, he was put again on the half-pay li3t. Ai soon as he was restored to health he applied for active employment. His demand was complied with. He retuned to Algeria, and received the command of the 2nd Battalion of Africa LiRht Infantry, known by the name of the Zephyrs. e took part in the attack on Cherchel, in 1841, and was left in occupation of that fortrem While defenldingit against the Arabs Ca.vaigna was wounded in the thigh. For his gallant conduct during the siege he was promoted to the rank of hLeutenant-Colonel, and to thiat of full Colonel of Zonavee, vice L3amoriciere, who was promoted to Genera of Brigade, and in 1844 was named General of Brigade ani Governor of the Province of Oran. On the success of the catastrophe of February, 1848, the Provisional Government raised him to the rank of General of Division, and named him Governor of Algeria. He was soon after offered, through the influence of his brother's friend, Armand Marrast, the Poet of Minister of War under the Republic, which he d3clined until the Provisional Government made way for the Executive Commision of Five, when he left Algeria and returned to France. The events that occurred between that period and the brealdng out of the insurrection of June, when he was appointed Preddent of the Council of Ministers and Chief of the Executive Powers, In other words Dictator, are still too fresh in the publlo mind to be noticed in detail. His conduct on that occasion, though perhaps too slow and irresolute in th 3 beginning, certailysaved France from the Vandals of the revolution. The measures adopted after the insurrection waa suppre"sd, though neeessary,were still more severe than those which his parby had so often denounced under Louis Philippe. Martial law, that is the will of the Dictator, was proclaimed in Paris. Thousands of the vanquished insurgents were imprlsoned in Ithe casemates of the detached forte, and without trial were despatched to the seaports for transportation. Trheir leaders were tried by military commisions, and, the penalty of death for political crimes having been abolished, several of them were condemnned to hard labour for life. The hard law of necessity was the justification of measures which nevertheless alienated from the Republican General the mam of the Ultra-Revolutionists. He suspendel thepress, and the treatment of one distinguished journalist,vho was imprisoned and keptincloe confinement without any alleged motve, warranted the suspicion that Cavaignac's better nature bad yielded to 1;he influence exeried over him by the party whose organ was the National newpaper and who aimed at the total extiction of the Presse. General Cavaignac was elected to the National Assembly by 144,187 electors of the Seine; he wa3 fourth on the list of 34 elected candidates, and at the same time by more than 44,000 of the department of the Lot, the second on the list of 7, and immediately after Lucien Murat, son of the exKing of Naples. His choice fell on the deparbment of the Lot, which he represented in the Assembly. He was ono of the Generals arrested at the coup d'dt ifn December, 1851. le was not lon g after Zowed to return to Paris, when he maried Mademoiselle Odier, the daughter of the banker or that name. He was elected deputy to the Legislative Corps in 1852, but refused to take the oaths to the new Government. He was again namel in June last one of the deputies of the Seines and there is no doubt that when the time came to open the Chambers he would have again refused ti take the oaths. The uprightness and integrity oF General Cavaignc have never been serioully caue I in question; his position and Influence with the Reoublican party was perhaps more owing to family trafitions than to any decided opinions of his own He may have been a sincere,. but he certainly was a prudent, Republican durngthe reign of Loui. Philippe, at whose hands he accepted promotion and honour, and whom he continued to serve to tha last. Until the Revolution of iFebruay he never occupied any marked place among the party. Duzing the disouzs'n ina comnmittee on the Reform of the Constitation, of which M. de Tocqueville was the reporter, General Cavaignao went so far as to maintainthattheRepublic was even superio: to the will of the people, and, in fact, thai the nation had not the right to be other than Republican ! After his marriage GeneralCavaignac led a tranquil and retired life, and in the midst of domestic happiness seemed to forget or to disregard the turmoilandvexation of politic. It s known that he allowed his name to be put forward in 1852 and 1857 as the candidate for Paris, rather out of deference to his party than from any desire of his own; and since his last election he catefully avoided aU discussion in politics. Kind, goodnatured, honourable, but of yielding character, he was not fitted to govern a nation like France, and had he been elected Psident iD the Republic he would infallibly have been swept away in the revolutionary deluga. His stand against the barbarisms of June is an esxceptional ease. In his good qualities and defects I think a generalresemblanoemaybe detectedbetween his character and that of Espartero. Both honourable and lpright men, beth liable to be led into error by to great facility of temper; but both honest and patriotic citizens The following private tlegram has been received: " Berne, 30th.

The Minister of Finance has addressed to the Emperor the followingimportant report, setting forth the financial situation of the country, and explanatory of the Budget of 1859, about to be submitted for examination to the Council of State:- "XSire,-I have received the documents necessary for drawing up the Budget of Roeeipts and Expenses for 1859, and I beg to request your MIajestys permisslon to submit them to the examination of the Council of State. " Before pointiug out the principal resaults of my preparatory labour, I think lt my duty to call to mind, in * few words, the charges originating in past years, and the measures which have been taken to effect their liquidation. At lbe moment when the country, after having, for four years, gone through circurstances of exceptional diffxcult, enters on an era which is in so many respects more favourable, it is natatal to ask how the fiances have met the severe trials which they have had to support. This recurrence to the past, by showing the truth drawn from official sources, will have the advntage of enlightening the public rmlnd on points which ar not sufficiently well known, and which have often been the object of false or exaggrted appreclations. " In order to give to this statement every dedrable clear. mess, I must call the attention of your Majesty to the rela. tions which inseparably unite the three elementry parts of our financial system-namely, the budgets, the floating debt, and the consolidated debt. One of the fundamental prinoiples of the French Administration presanibes to the Treasury topay immediately all the regularly authenticated publicexpenses. This rule, whioh has been punctualy observed in France for more than 40 years, under all gimi bs founded the mnodern credit of the State on the absolute confidence so justly inspired by thefulfilment of its engage-o meuts. When the taxesand revenues recelved ea year it virtue of the budget of receipts are not sufficient to provide forthe wants of a service established with such regularity, the Finance Department supplies the deficlencyprovidonally by means of the produce of Treaur bonds, and of the amounts whichhavebeen paidintoitsoffice by thereceiversgeneral, the Caisse des DWpots, the communes, and itg other correspondents. The sums thus borrowed aro to be rein tursed, and constitute the floating debt. When the floating debt acquires an excessive development, and when ita repayment might create embarrassment, it is consolidated Into perpetual Rentes. The budgets, the floatlng debt, and the consolidated debt are, therefore, closely connected together. The insuffidency of the budgets compels recourse to be had to the floating debt, and the too large amount of the floating debt almost inevitably leads to the increase of the consolidated debt. " Dxrcrrs or Tsn Br:Gm,s. "T 1he budgets are, therefore, the capital point and the generating element of the whole fiacal situation, which improves or deteriorates in proportion to their definitive resuits. t is, therefore, with the greatest reason that publRc opinion should make them instinctively the object of its most lively preoccupations; that the Government devotes such particular cara to this part of their task; and that your Maesty has consddered the establishment of the oquilibrium between the annual recelpts aud expenses as one of the greatest services that can be rendered to our country. " That undertaking, Sire, it must be admitted, was not an easy one. It required long efforts and a determined will; as, not only were the extraordinary difficulties of the present to be surmounted, but tho3 aslso which have been hnded down to us from the past. At the period of the 2d o December, 1851, a considerable dfference, the work of former days4existed between the charges and the resowurces of the State. The budget of 1847, the last of the monarhy of Tuly, closed with a defiit of 257,000,000f. Thedcefict of the budget of 1851, the last of the Republi, exceeded 100,000,000f. " Such was the starting point of the present Govermneni, and such the distance which separated us from an equili. brium. The object In -view was to fill up the pre-existing sanuum between the resources and the expenses, and to piovide for new wants. In the first year (1852), notwith. tt,nding the i-crease of charges Inseparable from a new organization of authority on the widest and strongest bases, the deficit of the year was reduced three-fourths as compared with the preoding one, aa from 100,000OO00f. it was brought down to 25,000,000f. In 1858 It waS still fur1her reduced, and did not exceed 23,000,000f. In 1854 the improvement of the finances continued to follow a progresdlve course, when, almost at the same time, the war which broke out in the East, the scarcity of food, snd other scourges created extensive wants. " France has never hesitated at sacrifioe called for by her honour and by the duties of hu;manity. The sudden increase of the army and navy, the dearness of provisions and of forage, the assistance distributed to the suffering people the grants for public works, and the other necessitles of a state of things unusual in so many ways, gave an unforeseen increase of 440,000,000f. to our expenses. The loan of 250,000,000f., the proceeds of which were devoted to the budget of 2854, was evidently insufficient to supportsuch & burd n; and henoe the deficit of 186,000,000f. which resuited in the accounts of that year. No one Is ignorant that the influenoes of the sme auses became aggravated in 185, and that they ware prolonged to 1856, and must make themselves still felt in some branches of the publc service during the present yea; but, thanks to the lst two loans, authorlzed in view of these extraordinary necessitieS, the result of these three years will be very different from that of I84. " In wltnessing the increased ardour and the really unheardof gerness withwhich, ln subsoribing to these loans, thepeople respondedtothesaceessiveappealsof your majesty, It might be wdsd that they consulted much less their re. sources than their patrlotism and their devotion, but the result has shown the wonderful power of our country. It has been able to furnish in less than three years with perled exactitude the 1,500,000,000L which were asked from it. 1 Iam happy to repeat to your MajsWty that, contrary to fears which have been several times expre"sed, the regular payment of the instalments of the loans,* the stlll Increasiengprogress in the indirect revenue, and the payment In advance of the direct taxes, wiMl have given us the means of oompletely meeting, and without any kind of embarrassment, ihe ordinary and extraordinary expenses of 1855, 1856, and 1857, and that, notwithstanding the war in the East and its consequences, and in spits of the publc calamities which weighed so heavily on them,t these years will not add a centime to the amount of previous arTe *rs. "1 The Council of State has now before it the bill for the definitive settlement of the budget of 1855. The general balance of that year shows a definitive surplus of resources of 394,000,000f., which are carried on to 1856. The budget of 1856 will present an available balance of about 106,000,000f., by which that of 1857 will profit. The year 1857 is now sufficiently far advanced to allow the result of it to be foreseen. Although it has hadto supporb the dearness of provisions, and the heavy charges caused bj the war, It wil give us a surplus of 20,000,000f. at least, the employment of which wll be hereafter determined on; and which mnay, if necessary, be devoted as a fund for the tublic works necessay to prevent a recurrenoe of iuun. dations. "A As to the budget of 1858, I cannot speak of It, excepb to remind your Majesty that it was voted with a suplus of receipta of 20,000,000f., and that already the progress of the revenue has exceeded, by more than 24,000,000L, * the cldcolation which served as the basis of the estimatea. " Such are the satisfactory results which I have to point out to sour Majesty, and they are an undoubted proof of tho resources of our oountry. Your Maiesty will not, without legltimato pride, see France, under a government suited to her instinots and favourable to the development of her wealth, find in her resources, and in the midst of the great-. eat visitations, the mneans of furnishIng hx three yeas .more than 1,500,000,OOOf. for the war, of extendlngher commerce, of undertaking on the moat extensive scale great works of general and local utility, of suocouring mis fortune, ad of coming out of all these trials with her fioanoes in a ssatisfaotory state. The year 18I54 is, thereforo, the last that will close with a defdit. The budgets having ceased from 1855 to increase the amount of the defidt, it is necessary, iu order to ascertain the total amount, to go back to former years. Their aggregate, which has been frequently the object of singular exaggeration, amounts, to a sum of 8S6,OO,OOOf.,whichmsaybedividedaafollows:-292,000,QOf are a balanoe left by the Government of July; 359,00W,0001. belonged to the Republic; and 235,000,0 . only are the effect of the present Government. These 285,000,000!. are not even a deficit, properly so called. A. fact which has not been sufoiently remarked is, that since 1852 a lager sum The ums received from the loan up to the 26th lust. amnountea to 1,534,678,747f. "1 The increase of the expenee oaued to the War and Murine Departments by the dane t of provisions and forage in 1854, 185, 185, MCd 1857 aniounte to not Ilam takeplacee du85ing the leat qare of 1857 andr duing the than that has been devoted to public works* This outlay, in fact, was only uweful investment of money, an increase to the riches of the country, and a loan made by the present for the advantage of the future. Fzom this it muay be concluded that if, in imitaion of preceding Governmenfs, your Majesty, in order to meet the outlay, had had zecourse, as it would have been just to do, to special loans, the Imperial period would not have figured at all in the account of the deficits of budgets. " FLoATnTG Dzsr. I Is now easy to give an acount of the floating deb% of its character, of its causes, amd of its impoitnce. Its principal object is to supply the Insufficiency of the budgets. It is consequently this debt that has furnished the 886,000,000f. which have made up the deficit of all rUgime. f tothis sum be added the 78,000,000f. advanced in 1852 by he Treasury to reimburse the holders of 5 per Cent, Rentes who did not accept the conversion,t the real wants which it was necessary to provide for will be exactly asoertained " Although this state o: things was in a great measure, as has just been shown, the work of preceding Governments, and although, unader existing circumstances, it wasnot of a ature to inspiro serious uneasiness, it did not the lass attract the attention of your majesty. " Your Majesty thought that it was the duty of a wise and provident Government, after having checked the pro. gress of the floating debt, to reduce it to such proportions that it would, under any circumstamces, afford the Treasury the most complete security. The solidity of the Treaury is not only the basis of the credit of the StAte, but it is of the bighest importance for credit in generaL " By means of the legilative combinations voted last session, and of the treaty which your ajesty authorizod rne to conclude with the Bank of France, the floating debt wM in a short time. and without any shock, be reduced *o about the sum of 750,000,o00f. This amount has nothing excesive in it as regard the actal movement of businem and of capitaL In order to be convnced of this, it suffices to know vthata very great part of It may be furnlhed by the obligatory paymernts which the Treasury Itelf, in the state of our legislation, cannot refuse, and to which it would be difficult to give any other employment. Under thee conditions, the Treasury Bonds, which fornx the noet delicate past of the floating debt, on acooun0t of their being due at short dates, may come down to about 100,000,000f.; the administration of the finances wMll be in a sate sulficiently normal to be freed on this subDjet from any pr cecupatlon, while witing until It can improve It stll more -an object towards whlch all the efforts of the Government must always tend.+ S CONSOLDATED Dmrr. "The last three loans, notwithstanding their glorious cau9se ald their prodigio sucess, hsave not the less been for public credit a trial which your Majesty has diracted to be attended to. When it was in contemplation to consolidate the floating debt, you preferred, and with good ron, the system which, by the immobilization of Rentes created for that purpose, responded best to that idea. New Rontes, consequently, will not be isaed ia the market; the Grand livre will be closed, and everything leads us to hope that It will be so for a long time, and that nothing will happen tD interfere with the final classification of the ssecrities recently negotiated. "S Not to augment the consolidated debt Is certainly, In the l4terest of public credit, a very sIutary resolution; but to profit by periods of cabn and financial prosperity to re. duce it would be an act of the highest prudence. Your Majesty has taken into consideration, with a most Xnxous solidtude, whether pre3ent circumstanes ctould warrant it being thought of. " In 18I4 the snldng fund was set down in the general expens of the State, and It was prudent to maiantain that resourceinthe budget aslong as it was necessry. In order to produce its ful effect, the sinldng fond ought to result from A Positive surplus of receipts, as, if not so, the funds which it absorbs produce a deficit in the budget, the deficit augments the floating debt, and that ends, sooner or later, in a consolidation into Bente, that is to say, into a cause of perturbation for public credit and a loss for the Treasury, 4" Some persons have been of opinion that as ralsway are one day, by the terms of their conceasionE, to revrt to tie State, the inkldng fond would ba hanceforward wlthoua any real utility. It Is certain, Sira, that a per contra to the GrandIlvre thatiaense vilne,maybe set down, represent. icg nearly 4 milliards, giving already a gross annual revene of upwards of 300,000,000f., and which is destned to Increase for a long time yet iu capital and produce, and which on0 day will equal, and even probably exceed, the whole amount of the public debt. This corsideration proves what productive and well-conoeived sacrifices the expenses of the State, intended to favour the development of theee great works, are, independently of thelr general utliity, and in the special point of view of the State it8elf. It asts the truest and most billiant light on the finanoial future of Fnce. But, this future being stilldisant, the sinking fund would still be a measure of foresight for days of difficulty, a fair one towards the holders of stock, to whom it has been promised by all the laws enacting loas, and x. padient and excelent for pLblic credit, Of which it would be the firm support, Cao we now, Sire, noidthstanding the cc spection called for in such a case, undertake to re-estahlish it, at least partialy? For my part, I think so " The question was oomplicated, and could not be solved by a single stroke of the pen. It wa essmtial to make close examinations, and, In order to destroy mere illusions accomplish certain preliminary conditions which I always regarded as indispensble. The first was the closing of the Grand Livre; but, s all parts are connected in our financial system, it was in particoular requisite to put a torm to the increAse of the d&ouverts. Now, the progress of them has been arrested since 1855, while the deoree of the 10th of November last provides for the future, inasmuch as it sub. mite to av rigorous control the opening of supplementary credits, and prescribes that the expenses shall be confined within the limits of the reources In hand, it must consequently be consideredt a guarantee of order and correctness It was, secondly, neoessary to adopt proper steps to reduce the floating debt to moderate proportions. This mesre will be accemplished in a very satisfactory manner by the combinations which I have described both in their nature and results. Finally, it was essential, in the normal condition on which the budgets are about to enter, and with the ordinary elments of receipts nd expenditure, to prevent the umm set aside for the sinking operations from creating a deficit. Are we authorized at the present moment to look for that result with a sufficient degree of oertitude ? That, Sire, willbe replied to by an examtnation of the Budget of I859. " BUDGnrT OF 1859. " In order to put adde a1i chance of error, and to proteot ourselves as far as possible from miscalculations, we ought to maintain and even extend in our valuation of the budget of 1859 the rule of prudenoe which presided over the prepartion of the two preceding budgets. The receipta ad expenditure have been drawn up in tbat spirit With regard to the receipts, I have taken for basi the exist-ing taxes, and have calculated their produce fter the facts accomplished in 1857, or the antidpatons already ad. mitted for 1858. That mode of proceeding permits us to reserva for unexpected cases considerable augmentations, which will in all probability be produced in the coure of the years 1858 and 1859.

"Publie opinion is seriousy right in being nng wlhen order is threatened either at home or abroad, when authority is weakened, when the Treaury is embarrassed and the loating debt Increased, when loans are imminent and the budgets are in defidt, when harvests are insuIficIent, when public prosperity is checked in its march, and when commerec becomes slackened or compromised. But, in good faith, must it not be admitted that public tranquillty Was never more oomplete, authority never stronger or more respected, foreign policy never more popular and mpre national, and that our reations with foreign, Government3 were never snore perfect than now? " The Treasu is in an exoellent situation. For aeve ral years the amount of dccouvelts has not in. creased; the reduction of the floating debt is asamred; all the loans are paid up; the Grand Livre has been indefinitely closed; and the dnking funi couldbe re-esablshed. In giving us abundant hrvests, Providenoe hs delivered us from our principal danger. The increse, ally marvellou, of indimect taxes and revenues has not only the advantage of facilitating finaCil re forms, but it proves the developmeat in an unhoped-for degree of the actity of the country. From 1847 to 1857 the amount of importations and exportatlons united rose, for the special commere of rance, iroom 1,664,OOD,Of to 3,881,OO,000f. Navigation has progreed in the sAme manner; and in the mae interval the imports of gold and silver have exweeded the exports by morethan 1,400,000,0Of. In the nine months of 1857 the excsss of Imports war 62,000,000. In reaity, then, the drculation is far from having deolined; but the employment of sDecle has incrsed in proportion to the extension of affairs "Commerce and manufactures, which, docile to the reiteated counels of the Government, have not made an abuive useof credit, receivse at this moment the reward of their prudence. A thing worthy of remark is, that during the very difficult yeas we have pained through, and amidst the commercia dissters which have afflicteduani still Oict most of the markets of Burope and the Now World, the importanoe of bankruptcies in Franoe has followed, as it were, a descending sale. " The Bank of Franoe had entered the path of liberal meaures, when, led way (etrain) by the eample of foreign banks, it wxs forced, in order to protect it, metallic reserves, suddenly to ralse the rate of discount. But it must not be forgotten that tis measure is esentially temporary; that the Bank pomeses at this mo. ment 50,00Q,O)Of. of specie more than at the same period lut year, and that, thanks to good crops, it hs not to pro. vide for the same exigencies. Although les -weln armed than at present, it has surmounted at other epochs difri. cuties much more grave by oonfining itelf to a pru dent line of conduct avowed by the law and by reason, and without having recourse to any empirical means which ill understood interest might counsel, but which re con. demned by the experiene of all times and all counties, and which would be rejected by the Bank of France with no leEs energy than by the Government. " The abundance of titles aring from the last loans, the absenceof allslnkingfundwhenit wouldh ve been themost neessary, and the concurrence of railway bonds hxve plwed our publio funds in a difficult situation. But, on the one hand, the classification of the Rentes, which must be the work of time, is now far advanced; since 1I5d, the period of the first loan, the Treaury alone hs purchased for the account of the departments to more than 400,000,C0f. On the other hand, until the sinking fund, resored for 1859 can come into operation, the Rentes which may be brought for the dotation of the army will produce a irnmilr effect from 1858. As to railway bonds, as the works adivance the urgent necssities of the companies naturally tend to decreame; their budget for 1858 wil be a proof thereof, and, moreover, I tmst that measures ray be taken to regulate their ise, by agreement between the companies, the Bank of Free, and the Government. " Hence, as regards our situationr, Its elements are funda. mentally good; no one can deny it in good faith.

CONSTANTINOPLE, OcT. 2L Both the political and financial position here are as dark as they were a week ago. The definitive organization of the Minitry Is daily expected, but seems to be labouring under even greater difficulties than usuaL Numbers of combinations are afloat, but as none of them is based on anything more solid than the personal coniderations of themoment, whichever of them succeeds it can never excite very sanguine hopes for the future.* The persons who have at tis mnoment the ascendant are the same who were in the former Minfistry of Aall Pasha, but they are broken up into frctions and are working against, instead of 'with, each other. Formerly there was a tolerably compact phaln, at the head of which was the triade consisting of Aali, Fuad, and Rushdi, the Minister of War; with Kibrili protecting the flan and lways ready to take his post in the firstrank, at d with Mus Pasha, the hinister of Finance, guarding the rear. Seeminglytheystill hold togethercornon dangs r forces them to do so-but inrelityeachof them has his ovn pet scheme; if he sees that t is hopeless) then he goes over to the Eecond best, and so on. The whole is set in movement by Fuad and Rushdi, who alone are stl holding together. This alliance is possible because Ruhhdi Pasha is more ambitious than vain, and prefers real power to the empty title of Grand Vizier, which he would cede willingly t3 Fuad, Two persons are in the way of this duumvirate-these are their former allies, Aali and Mbrisli. The means taken to get rid of them and thus to obtain their aim are rather curious, Nobody can deny talent and honesty to Aali Pasha, but every one, except his colleagues, admitted with regret that he was wanting in firmnew. It is now his colleagues who lay the greatest stress on this defect in his character, and if you listen to their sycophants, 'whose business it is to acquaint the world with this change in the opinion of their protectors, he is nothing better than a clog, un cadavre, who is utterly unfit to be Grand lizier. The fact is that, althouigh unable himsef to lead, he is by no me Inclined to be led, conwequently he is inconvenient. Aali had enough, 1 think, with his former experience of the poet of Grand Vinier, and is by no means desirous to try it again, so there will be no difficulty In putting him aside. Tbings stand rather differently with Kibrisli Since he lot the poet of Grand Vizier during the war he ha been playmg the Unatisfactory part of fifth wheel in the State car, which was put on whenever one of the others broke down and was repairing. No wonder he is tired of it, especially as he is not without influence in the Palace, and as his position of reserve wheel has suggested to him the thoughts of the fly on the wheel. It will be, therefore, difficult to put hina aside, a;nd he is too wide awake to be taken in a narm An attempt was made, but it failed. You will probably know that the Powers have agreed to appoint their resident Ambassadors and Ministers as their Plentpotentiaries at the coming Congress at Paris which is to settle the remaining detail questions of the Treaty. Those who wanted to get rid of Eibrisli here proposed that as the questions to be discumsed there regarded more particularly Turkey, this latter was in ana exceptional position, and ought to sd an extaordiy Ambassasador for the pnrpose, for which poet Kibriai was reposed; but as he sawr that this was dolne n order to send him away, he risted, aand on this resistance the schemes of Fuad and Rwihdi will probably be wrecked. If they cannot ikeep the wxhole powler to themselves they wrill probably put Kibrial forwad for fernss sake as GErand Viier, nd wait for a better opnortunit y. A few days will decide the point.

THE BIBLE AN-D THE INDIAN GOYERY- MENT SCHOOLS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It is not an agreeable work to discountenance the wishes of sincere and earnest men, especially when the object at which they aim commands one's entire sympathy. Butthere is no duty to be more carefully fulfilledthan that of examining coolly and dispassionately, by the best light we can bring to bear upon them, the means proposed for effecting an end which, being ardently desired, is from that very circumstance calculated to make men's " wishes fathers to their thoughts." This reflection has been suggested by the letter of Mfr. Thomas in your journal of yesterday, strenuously advocating the enforcement of the use of the Holy Scriptures in the Governnent schools of India, in the event of it being the will of the Almighty to restore our dominion in that country. Heregards such a measureas notonly expedient, but a paramount duty, and the tone of his letter leads to a fear that he will find it difficult to believe any one can conscientiously take a different view who has not inherited "the irreligion and laxity of morals of a former generation." There are two ways, and only two, so far as I can perceive, in which the Bible, if introduced into native schools, may be expected to operate beneficiaUy. The first is as a direct means of Christian instruction, as " the source of Christian morals." I cannot doubt that Mr. Thomas sees that if Christian morals are to be taught from " the Bible in all its .ntgrity" including the Old Testament as well as mthe New, they can only be taught as a portion of the Christian scheme. This is the idea which underlies the old definition of the " canon" or "' rule of the Church," making it to consist in the " concord and harmony" of the law and the prophets with the new dispensation, an idea which we practically express by collecting all the several scriptures into one volume and calling it "the Book." To teach Christian morals from the Bible is, therefore, simply to teach Christianity by one special method; and this your correspondent coaceives to be not merely a legitiiate object, but a sacred duty of the Indian Government, in framing the regulations of native schools. Many persons, no less zealous than MDr. Thomas for the conversion of India, wil entertain very grave doubts of this position. An objection that will occur at the outset to them is the absence of al guarartee for the existence of any definite Christian creed or Christian sentiment in the Indian Government itself. In the appointment of functionaries the question of religion has never yet been entertained; is it to beso in future? Is the entrance of the ProtestantDissenter, the Roman Catholic, the -Jew, into the Indian army or the civil service to be barred for the time to come; or is any obstacle to be interposed ta their advance from the lowest to the highest offices? May they not even come to sit together in the Supreme Council? If they may, on what principle can the Government consistently proceed in framing regulations for native schools, other than that of entire impartiality-cal it, if you will, indifference ? This may be bad; but it would be surely worse to have an official religionism, administered conjointly by men ostensibly of all religions, from a Socinian to an Ultramontane Romanist, to say nothing of Jews or infidels of every shade. Another way in which the introduction of the Bible into native schools may be thought likely to operate beneficially is if the Book be viewed simply as a collection of literature, and read as the Greek and Latin classics are in our own public schools. It is natural to expect that the beauty of many parts should make a profound impression upon the students, quite irrespectively of their religious charac. ter; and thus it may be hoped that the seed of Christianity wil be unconsciously sown in many hearts, and, after lying buried perhaps for many years, spring up under favourable circumstances and bear fruit. But here let us be aware that the portions of Scripture which attract a Western European the most are not those with which the Oriental mind will be most prone to sympathize. Present the volume to the proud Rajpoot or fierce Mahomedan as a free field to pasture in, and they are much more likely to find food suited to their palate in the narrative of the conquest of Canaan or the destruction of the worshippers of Baal than ia the words of Him who rebuked His disciples for desiring to caU down fire on those who refused to receive Him. I quite agree with Mr. Thomas, although In a different sense, that the question of the admission of the whole Bible to schools rests on a different basis in India and in this country. Here our whole habits of thought, our manners, our literature, have been in the course of centuries so leavened, unconsciously to ourselves, by Christianity, that we can venture to put the whole Bible into the hands of all, trusting to what I may call their religious common sense to harmonize its several parts. What would be made of it if brouglht into contact with other religions without any harmonizing agency supplied by a properly qualified teacher, or, as with us, by the Christianized atmosphere which surrounds us, it is impossible to say exactly; but in all probability the result would be some spurious compound of old and new notions, such as the Gnosticism of the early ages, the bastard Christianity of the Chinese rebels, Mahomedanism itself, and (nearer home) Mormonism may, perhaps, serve to illustrate. If the public mind of England is filled with a sense of shame at the little which has been done for the Christianization of India, let our repentance not be vicarious. There have been agencies quietly at work for many years, which have done much, and would have done more had they been supported as they ought. That they were not so supportel was owing to the profound indifference of people at home to all Indian topics; and now that we have awakened from our stupor, and begun to see how wicked and perilous it was, there seems a desire to atone for our own neglect, and set our consciences at ease, by urging upon the Indian Government the step of adopting a missionary character. It would be a worthier course to double our subscriptions to the missionary undertakings which already exist, and to urge upon our countrymen to do individually that which all sincere Christians will, upon reflection, be convinced is an obvious duty,-make some effort, great or small, for the extension of the kingdom of their Master. With the increased interest at home there would be a corresponding elevation of the tone of Anglo-Indian morality, and thus a more truly effective manifestation of our national Christianity than could result from any official act of the Indian Government. While that is only careful to show itself powerful, just, and wise, it may be forgiven for leaving religious instruction to the ministers of religion and religious demonstrations to the good taste of a well-ordered Christian societv.

CENTRAL OBIMINAL COURT, .aturday, Oct 31 OLD COURT. (Before the CHrFe BARoN.) THE BALIVS-POND MURDER. Robert Thomas Davis, 40, described as a carpenter, was indicted for the wilful murder of his wife, Martha Dan,v by cautting her throat with a razor. Mr. Payne conducted the prosecution; Mr. Sleigh was counsel for the prisoner. The learned counsel for the prosecution, in openTng the case to the jury, said, that although the prisoner was charged with a most dreadful offence, the evidenca to sup port it was very short and, he feared, conclusive. The prL soner would have the' able assistance of his learned friend to establish any extenuating circurnstances that might exist in the case, but he was sorry to say that it appeared to him that it 'would be inmpossible, upon the evidence, to reduce the crime of the prisoner below that of wilful murder, and that the facts would leave them no alternative but to find him gauilty of that crime. The following evidenoe was then adduced. Mark Walsh, a young lad, said-I live at the Royal William publichonse, Ball s-pond, and am a waiter there. I know the prisoner and the deceased. They were st the Royal William on the night of the 6th of October. I saw them going away. The prisoner was in liquor. He had a pint of beer in his hand, and reeled about. He asked me to carry the beer for him. Shortly after I had parted with the prisoner and his wife I saw a light in their bedroom, and as I passed the hous on my retrn I saw the prisoner and his wife strugglineg,andone of his cht°idrten,fcur years old, said to te pisonr "h, ou-I &tthesame moment the deceased ran out of the house wvith her throat ut, and she held up her hands and said, " Oh dear, lMrs. EIormau." Mirs. Horman swaw a neighbouir. The child followed the de. Cros-examined.-The prisoner and his wife were in the habit of coming to our house, and he always appeared to be very kind to his wife. He reeled about and appea-ed very drank when I met him in the street, and when I saw them the secoad time they appeared to be struggling and quarrelling. John Austen sald,-I am the landlord of the Royal George publichouse, Lower-road, Islington. The prisoner and his wife were at my house on the night of the 6th of October, and they had a pint of beer and a quartern of rum, and the prisoner took away the beer in a little can. The prisoner was not quite sober at this time, but knew perfectly weR what he was about. The deceased sat down and nursed the child all the time she was in my house, and she appeared to be sober The prisoner poured out a portion of the rum into a glass and handed it to his wife, and said, "Here, my dear, you drink first." Sarah Stump said,-I lived in the same house with the prisoner and his wife in Dorset-street, Ball's-pond. Their roomn was under mine. I was in bed on the night of the 6th of October, and heard a " grumbling" noise in the prisoner's bedroom, and the prisoner called his wife a - -. I afterwards heard him say, " I wil go and get it." I told my husband to get up, and we both went downstairs to the prisoner's room, and as we were going down the stairs I heard the deceased say, " You rogue, you are going to kill me ;" and directly afterwards she and her child called MIfurder I" three times. When I got down I saw Mrs. Davis staggering aloDg the passage, and the prisoner coming out of the door. They were both dressed, and they ran into the street. The child, who was covered with blood, followed them, and I saw that the prisoner had a razor in bis hand. My husband laid hold of him and said, " Good God, Bob, what have you done I" The prisoner replied, " I have done the deed for her ; I have done it to rights this time." He then said, " This is what I done it with, and I will give it to you." and he handed my husband the razor. The prisoner was "on," but not so drunk as I have seen him; he was completely covered with blood. Crora-examined.-There wfas a good dealof strugglin and quarrelling in the prisoner's room before I avwoke my husband, Sarah Anne Day aaid,-I lived in the same house with the prisoner and his wife, and I remember them coming home about 11 o'clock at night on the 6th of October. I heard the prisoner call his wife by an offensive name, and she replied " No dear, don't say that, I have enough of you." After they had been in their room a short time I heard the prisoner say, "You-, I wiMgo and get it and doit." He thencama out of his bedroom door and locked the deceased in, and kicked open the door of the front room, and immediately afterwards went back to his bedroom. Directly after this the deceased said, " You - rogue, you are going to kill me." The prisoner did not make any reply, but almost directly the deceased and the child begau to scream, and I heard the child say, " Oh, father, you are killing my mother." I went downstairs and saw deceased in the passage, and the prisoner had a razor in his hand, which was covered with blood. When he saw Mr. Stump he said, " Come along Jnck, I give myself up." He afterwards said, " I have done it, Jack; I have done for thethis time." He added "I am a happy man now. Iam ready to give myself up and die for what I have done." The prisoner was not sob. Cross-exanxined.-The prisoner made use of bad language to his wife the moment he came In. I did not hear her say anything to him. John Stump, the husband of the former witness, confirmed the evidence given by her. He said that he heard Ecreams and kicking in the prisoner's room, and when he v;ent down he saw the prisoner with a razor in his hand and "s mothered" In blood, He laid hold of the prisoner and said, " What a foolish man you must be to do this !" le replled, "Ntver mind, I have done it this time." The prisoner then wanted to be allowed to go into the yard, but witness told him he was in his custody, and he should not part with him until a policeman came. A policeman arrived soon afterwards, and he gave the prisoner in charge for murdering his wife. Edmund Phillips deposed that he was a provision dealer, and lived near Dorset-street. The prisoner and his wife were in the habit of dealinz at his shop. On the night of the 6th of October, about five minutes to 11 o'clok, he heard a scream from the prisoner's house, ard Mrs. Davis ran out directly afterwards and went across the road, and staggered towards the house of a person named Horman. She was abouitto fall, and be laid hold of her and asked what was the matter. She could not speak, bat pointed to her throat, and I saw that it was cut and blood was pouring from it. Mrs. Horman, the person referred to by the last witness, proved that she also assisted to support the deceased, and that she died almost immediately. A sergeant of the N division of police deposed that he received the prisoner in his charge at his own house shortly after11 o'dock on the night in question. The prisoner asked him to shake hands with him, and he inquired what he was charged with? Witness told him he was charged with the murder of his wife; and he replied i' I wish I had been In India to kill some of those - Sepoys." The prisoner then said that he should leave the things in the house in his charge, and he pointed to a workbox belonging to the deceased, and said he would find something there, and upon his openung it he found the certificate of the prisoner's marriage. As he was conveying the prisoner to the stationhouse he inBulred if his wife was dead, and witnecs told him she was, He then said, " ell, never mind, it cannot be helped, it was all done in a moment." At this time the prisoner appeared to be drunk. Mr. Langdon, an inspector of the same division, said, that shortly after the prisoner had been locked up he called to him and expressed a desire to make a statement relating to the murder. Ile told him he was not in a fit state at that time to make a statement, which it might be his duty to bring forward as evidence against him. At 3 o'clock on the following morning the prisoner sent for him again, and, after he had again cautioned him, he told him that he and his wife had been very comfortable all day, and came home together, and he had fetched a pint of beer and a pound of meat for their supper, and when he returned it all occurred momentarlly. He added, " But I did not do it." He then said "Is she dead?' Witness 'old him that she was, and he replied "Good G-3d! A better wife never walked on English ground." As witness was taking the prisoner to the police court in a cab he again said " I did not do it. I liked her too well to serve her like that." This was the case for the prosecution. Mr. SLEIGH then made a most powerful address to the Jury on behalf of the prisoner, and urged that the act had been committed under the influence of sudden passion and without premeditation, and that in the state of drunkenness the prisoner was at the time he was not aware of the nature of the act he was committing. Upon these grounds, therefore, he called upon them to acquit the prisoner of the crime of wilful murder, and find him guilty of manslaughter only. The CHRIF BAsrox, in summing up, said, that however painfrl it might be to them, in a court of jutstice all parties concerned in the administration of it were bound to perform their duty according to their oaths and their consciences, utterly irrespective of the consequences. He felt bound, therefore, to tell them that drankenness was an excuse that could not for a moment be admitted for sech an act as that committed by the prisoner, and it was clear that if it were it would tend very mueh to diminish the security of humau life, and the interests of society would be very much endangered if jaries were to give effect to such a defence. It was dreadful to think that ij a Christian country such a secne could occur as that of a man almost deliberately, in the presence of his child, cutting the throat of his wife, whom he had sworn at the altar to cherish and protect - bat the facts appeared to be undisputed, andhe was bound to tell them that drunkenness was no excuse for such an aot, that 'in law the offence was wilful murder and nothing else, and the prerogative of mercy vested in the Crown could alone zrneve sue prisoner from the consequences, if there should appear to b any circumstances in the case that would warrant such a course being adopted. The jury, after a short deliberation, returned a verdict of Guilty.' Mr. Streight having called upon the prisoner in the usual form to state if he had anything to urge why sentence of death should not be passed upon him, He replied,-" I loved my wife and child too dearly to deprive either of them of lie, but my senses were destroyed by the liquor I had taken. I loved her too well to hurt a hair of her bead if I had been in my senses." The OCEx? BARON then put on the black cap, and, addressing the prisoner, safd, he had been convited of the crime of wilful murder ander circumstances that were calculated to produce the deepest feeling of horror at -the offence of which he had been found gailty. After retiring to his bedroom, an infant four or five years old being there at the time, he had deliberately gone out to another place to fetch a razor, having in the meantime locked his wife and child into the room so that they could not make their escape, and he then returned, and, in the eresence of his child, and ia spite of the shrieks for mercy m ade by them, he had outhis wifes throatandoccasioned her death. It had been suggested-and probably it was true-by his learned counsel that drunkenness was the "ause of the crime. He thought it was very probable that a long indulgence in the vidons propsnsity of drunkenness might at last have reduced his mind to a state that enabled him to commit such a horrible crime; but it should be known by all addicted to the same course of conduct that dronkenness was no excuse, and that where an act of violence commited w:sle in that state resulted in death the offenre was muider, aId murder only. The Crown alone could show any mercy to him, bat ha eLtread him not to entertain the least hope or expectation that it would be exercised in his case, and he exhorted him to Prepare for that fate which he appeared bimself to have anticipated immediately after the commission of the crime. The lesrned judge concluded his address by passing sentence of death in the usual form. ahe prisoner, tho trembled violently, and seemed to be endung a good deal of mental anguish was then removed Alexandler Moody, 41L shoemaker, was indicted for the manslaughter of his wife Ann Moody. Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Clark conducted tho prosecution. The prisoner was defended by Mr. Sleigh. This charge appeared to be preferred against the prisoner under somewhat peculiar circumstances. The prisoner and his wife lived in Grosvenor-mews, and about 12 o'clock at night on the 17th of August she came home in a state of Intoxication, and the prisoner shortly afterwards also came home. A woman named Appleton, who lived ia an adjoining house, stated that Immediately afterwards she beard the prisoner abuse his wife, and that she heard two or three blows struck, and then everything was silent. On the following morning the deceased was found in an insensible state, with some marks of violence upon her face; and the prisoner at first, upon being questioned, said that she had fallen out of bed, but afterwards he said that, finding her in a beastly state of intoxication when he came home, he had given her a pat or two. The deceased was removed to the hospital, where she died on the 30th of Augast, and she was buried under a certificate from the surgeon that she had died of apoplexy. At the time it would seem that no suspicion was entertained that the prisoner had been in any mauner instrumental in causing the death of his wife, but after she had been buried the woman Appleton was continually abusing the prisoner and annoyinghim in the streets by saying that he had killed his wife, and he was compelled at length to summon her before 'Mr. Bingham, and she was fined 40s, and ordered to procure sureties to keep the peace towardsthe prisoner. It appeared that after this the Womxn Appleton had made statements to the polce which induced them to institute further inquiries, and the result was that on the 12th of October the arisoner waa taken into custody and committed for trial upon the present charge. The woman Appleton, who was the only witness to show that any violence had been exercised by the prisoner towards the decensed, was examined as a witness, and she deposed to hearing what she represented to have taken place in the night of the 17th of August. Mr. Webb, an inspector of polioe, who was also a witness, stated, however, that he had placed a constable in the priEoner's room, while he himself was in the room occupied by Appleton, and that he could not hear the constable speak unless at the very top of his voice. He also stated that it was in consequnene of the statements made to him by the woman Appleton after she had been fined by the magistrate thiat he instituted further inquiries, and that he eventually took the prisoner into custody upon his own responsibility, without say warrant or without the anthority of a magis Another witness named Mary Annne Draper also said, in answer to questioas put by Mr. SLEGE, that while the deceased was in the hospital Appleton brought spirits to her eontrary to the orders of the doctor, and it also appeared that when the medical men stated the death to be the result of apoplexy she made no T6presentation that the prisoner had been gauilty of any violence towards the deceased. The C BARoN, in the course of the case, expressed his opinion that the police, in apprehending the prisoner, under the circumstances, wthout a warrant'or the authorilty of any magltrate, had greatly exceeded their duty, particularly when the information upon which they acted was derived from a person who did not appear to have moved in the matter until after she had been summoned by the prisoner and fined. The jury, he said, might hear more of the caseif theypleased, butiftheythoughttitunnecessary they were at liberty to say so. The jury, after a short consultation, said they would hear the counsel for the prisoner. Mr. SxImG accordingly addressed the jury, and he urgaed that it was evident that the charge had been trumped up by the witness Appleton out of revenge, and that there really was no evidence to support the accusation against the prisoner. Ie called as witneases the brother and sister of the deceased woman, and they stated that the prisoner and his wife had been married 15 years, and that they always lived happily together until the deceased became acquainted with the woman Appleton, who had led her into drunken habits. The Cmxim' BRox in summing up repeated the ob. servations with regard to the circumstances under which the case had been brought before the Court, and again expressed his disapproval of the course that had been taken by he police, and a hope that it would not be made a precedent on any future occasion, The jury at once returned a verdict of Not Guify, and the Iprisoner was ordered to be immediately discharged.
COUBT OFBANKRBUPTCF, Baeen9dlstlr Oct. 3L IN RE 0. J. MARE. (Before Mr. Commit,nn1 IT- - I l 3e DanKrUpt was a shipbuilder of Black wall. This was a meeting to consider a proposal on behalf of the bankrupt, under the 230th section of the Bankruptcy Consolidaion Act. The proposal was 4s. in the pound, or 2s, Od. in addition to the Is. 6d. already paid, payable in a fortnight by Mr. Peter Rolt, the bankrupt's father-in-law. The act re. quiresthatthe consent of nine-tenths of the creditors present In number and value be given before an order of the Court can be obtained so as to be binding upon the whole body, and the bankruptcy be thereupon annulled. After some formal proceedings, Mx. WALTs inquired the position of the estate. Mr. Lee (official assignee).-A dividend of ls. 6d. In the pound has been paid, and any further dividend will pro. bably be between It. snd Is. 6d. in the pound. Yr. LI}NsATFR (who aptearad for the bankrupt).-And that after litigation likely to bo of some duration. Mr. Lee said there were proceedings of that character pending. Mr. LINRLA.TEP.-The result of the meeting I find is this :-A large nmber of creditors, whose united proofs amount ts 160,C0001, accept the proposal made on behalf of t;he bankrupt, while the only two dissentients rre Mr. W.ailer's clents, creditors for 6001. ; and Messrs Barnes and Co., of Bristol (clients of Mr. Ditcher), 1,1001. The pro. posal is, therefore, almost unanimously carried, both in number and value. I may observe that there are creditors to the further amount of 150, 0001., who are favourable to the proposaL Mr. WAiLER said that of the entire body of creditors (388 in number), no less than 218 had sold their debts to Mr. Quilter. Creditors to the amount of 92,0001. had thus become disqualified from voting at all on the present occasion. These debts had been bought up at various rates. He saw a creditor in court who had sold his debt for 5s. in the pound and a gratuity of a further 5s. in the pound. Such cases ought to be taken into consideration. Creditors had been induced not to oppose. The CoanerssroxEE said if the parties referred to took no part in the proceedings, and did not vote, he did not see how they could be taken cognizance of. Mr. WALLE said the words of the Aot (the 231st section), which he had just read, were these:- to im. togetherwit h such gratuity ormc ettaud the bankrupt been no such transaction between him or any person wiLh his prlvity and saSy of tbe credlto:s, and that he has not used any undue mueans ar inEluence with any ef them to attain such sassnt." Mr. WA rTT:RB proceeded to urge that he could see no distinction in principle between a party who received a larger sum to induce hirm not to oppose and parties who did hcebomssio.REA.-A large number of those who sold their debts did so before the present proposal was thought of. Mr. WALLsR urged that if any doubt existed of debts baving been bought up for the purpose of quenching opposition, he would call a party to prove the statement. Mr. LmnK'T}R.-Swear him first. The speech afterwards. After some further discussion, it was submitted that the requirements of the Act had been complied with. The CosamsoNmR.-Yes. Bat as all the proceedings must be the act of the Court, I cannot consent to the bankruptcy being annulled until the whole of the money is paid to its officers. Mr. ImzrLAmn submitted that it was not necessary to deposit 4s. in the pound for debts that had been bought up or compromised. The ComemissIoza dissented. Mr. LiUKLATER did not think the point was one of any moment. His HoNouR then appointed a meeting to carry out the proposal and annul the bankruptcy. IN RE MOSLE AND MOSLEY. The bankrapts were newsagents in Catherine-street, Strand. This was a meeting for the proof of debts and choice of assignees. Mr. Ford appeared for the petitioning creditor. A proof was tendered on behalf of Mr. Cope, publisher of She Timea, and which proof included a dishonoured check. The ComLsioNER said Mr. Cope was an agent, and not the principal. He did not see how he could be allowed to prove the debt. It was urged that Mr. Cope was responsible for the amount. The CommissiOEnR.-But the proprietors would still have a legal olaim upon the estate. The proper counrse will be for the proprietors of The Times to make an affidavit of the debt, and forward it to the court; the claim will then be allowed. In consequence of this decision only three other debts wore proved, nearly every paper in London being in the same position. The total amnount of the bankrupts' debts is said to be about 5,00Of.; the assets abeut 5001. Mr. Smith, newspaper agent of the Strand, was chosen a£signee.
FOLICE. MA2SSIO0.HOUSL-Mr. Edwin Ward Jacuson, of No. 14, Craven-hill-gardens, Hyde Parks a magistrate of the county of Yorkshire, appeared before Mr. Alderman WIRE in answer to a summons which had been issued against hila at the instance of Mr. Benjamin Coleman, of 28, Poultry, charging him with having "unlawfaully and maliciously written and published a certain scandalous and defamatory libel of and concerning the said Benjamin Coleman, against the statute the 6th and 7th of Victoria, cap. 96, sec. 5." Mr. Tindal Atldnson appeared in support of the prosecution, and Mr. Sergeant Parry attended on the part of the defendant. Mr. Benjamin Coleman, the prosecutor, was sworn and said,-I canry on business in the Poultry under the f.rm of Coleman and Roberts. We deal in railway plant. In 1845 I was carrying on business as a stock and share broker in Liverpool, where the defendant at that time was resident. We were not his recognized brokers, but acted very largely for him. The result of our transactiops was a loss of 1,2L, the defendant, however, claiming at the same time a balance iu his favour of 900L. lHe entered an action against the rm for the supposed balance of 9001. due to himse1f, and abandoned it. He was p~osted as a defaulter hn e Stock-Exchange at Liverpool by the oommittee. I offered to refer the whole mattere in dispute between us to a personal frind of his, but the offer was refused, and the defedant left LiverpooL Twelve aonths afterwards he came to my office in a very impoverished state ; he was out at elbows ancd the buttons were drOpping fronm his coat. Sereiat Pary hare interpoed .and protested again this msode of examination being persisted in. What had tho defendana being out at elbows to do with the present charge? Examiaution contiaued.-He asked me to accept 200l. in liquidation of the debt of 1,2001. and to forget the past, and the receipt now produced by the defendant was tho result of that interview. The recept was put in ana read, and was to the followig effect:- -E200.-We heve hias I0th da, or Desem' er. 18iS, been paid by and reeived rrm nWard ackmav, Esq.. per the hand of Ir.

Examinatiorn continued.-For eight years afterwards I lost sight of the defendant. About swo years ago I met hila near my office in the Poultry. He stopped me and asked me if I was living in London, and several other questions. He sid he shond be glad to be of servioe to me. I replied, "The best service you can reader me is to pay me the balance you owe me, and which you solemnly promnised to pay me when you left Liverpool." The following day he called at my office, and told me that he was about to bring out a bank, and asked me what I thought of his going on to the direction. The name of the bank was rot mentioned at that time. I advised him not to do so on account of his anteeedents. Sereant Parry again interposed and with some warmth insisted upon the witness at once coming to the subjectmatter of the charge. Witnes.-On the 17th inst. I received by post the letter and envelope now shown me. The letter was read, as follows " Sir -There is a deep-dyed soDundrel about town w1r) is trying ariouaedodgsfortheourpeueofexta:,rt gmoney.

Coleman, sq., 28, Poultry, R.C." Examination continued.-I am acqauinted with the defen. dains handwriting. To the beEt of my belief the name " Coleman" in the letter is in the defendant's handwriting, although it is disguised. The figures *' 17"- and the lettrs a thr are most positively his. The inside of the envelope is, to the best of belief, the writing of his solicitor, Mr. Jervis. I know Mr. Jervis's handwriting. I received a letter froSE Mr. Jers. There Isa peculiar expressIon, "I cannot now have anything to do with yen," in that letter, which is the same expression as tsat inthe envelope. The address on the envelope ss, I believe, in the handwiting of Mr. Jervls, Mr. Atkinson.-I now propose to put the letter in and to make it evidence. Sejeant Parry.-.But you have not yet proved.the publl- Mr. Atkinson.-It assumes to have been addressed to a third party. Alderman Wrox.-Although it assumes to have been addressed to a third party it is perfectly clear that it was not. Serjeaut Parry.-I submit to you, Sir, that these is no evidence whatever here which will justify you Iu [aUowing the case to proceed, the very foundation of it being the publicatsonbiy the defendant of the libeL. Alderman WIRE.-I would rather not at the present ime give any judgment; I will see how the case shapes Examination continxed.-I received the letter on the 17th inst., upon which I consulted some friends and came to this court The conversation I hid with the defendant about the bank arose after he had mentioned a Mr. Wood's name. The bank was brought out a month or two afterwards, and the defendant became one of Its directors. I received a letter from Mr. Cazenove, and I put it into the defendant's hands, and asked him what reply I should make to it. Mr. Serjeant Parry.- What has all this to do with the cbarge against my client Alderman WiRE (to -Mr. Atkinson.)-Can you satisfy me of the identity of the publication of that letter with Mr. Jackson beyond the evidence you have now given ? If you say that you can or that you believe you can I will adjourn the case to enable you to do so. Mfr. Atkinson.-I pray for an adjourment. Serjeant Parry.-Do you pledge yourself that you have other evidence ? Mr. Atkinson.-We have reason to believe that we shall get oeherevidence. Of course, I do not state what the whole of my case is Alderman Wrnx.-Do you rest your case here, or do you I ask me to adjourn the inquiry to enable yoa to get further evidence to identify the defendant with the publication of Mr. Atkinson.-Yes. Alderman Wrx-If you rest it here I am prepared to give you my judgment at once. Serjeant Parry.-State either the name of the individual you can call or the nature of the evidence you can bring AldermanWIR.-This isa highly penal statute, I can. not, therefore, proceed under it unless I have such reason. able evidence before me as in my judgment will induce a jury to sustain the decision at which I may arrive. Mr. Atktnson.-I submit that there is a case here against the defendant which calls upon him for an answer. There is evidence of his handwriting in the libel itself; there is evidence of publication by him. AldermanWInE.-I should have been very glad if I could have arrived at anything like, I was going to say, satisfactory conclusion. The application was made to me, sitting here, to ranut a summons against Mr. Jackson upon a statement which I expected to be supported in evidence That statement is not only not proved, but iG is actuall disproved by the evidence of Mr. Coleman himself if there is such a discrepancy as that (and upon a matter so important as going to the vitality of the question) how can I possibly adjourn the case and give time, especially when neither Mr. Atkinaon nor his client will pledge himself to bring forward evidence to satisfy my mind upon that subject th- am afraid I have no alternative before me but to dlismiss the summons. The snumons was dismissed accordingly. Serjeant Parry.-Now,Sir, I would almost sk your advico in this matter. I am prepared now to give Mr. Coleman Into custody for writing threatening letters to Mr. Jackson with intent to extort money from him, under this very Act of Parliament, On the authority of Mr. Jackson I am prepared to give Mr. Coleman into custody. I will provo the letters at once before you, which will satisfy you that he ought to be remanded upon this charge; or I will apply for a summons upon those letters, and the hearing shall be adjourned to a future day, provided the suammons be at once served and Mr. Coleman undertake to appear; otherwise I shall give him into custody. Alderman Wmrx.-I have disposed of one case. If any other be brought before me legally I will enter upon it. Serjeant Parry.-On behalf of Mr. Jackson, then, I give Mr. Coleman into custody for sending three threatening letters to him, and attempting to extort money. Alderman WnIM-I think the best way would be for the parties to refer the matter to some mutual friend, and let him say what ought to be done. Mr. Coleman.-I have offered that over and over again. Mr. Seijeant Parry.-There is no mutual friendship. If you cannot grant me a surmmons I will at once withdra w; but 1 can prove the grossest attempt at extortion by Mr. Coleman. Alderman WIRB}-Mr. Serjeant Parry wll pursue the proper course. If he has any charge to make against Mr. Coleman he will come here with a written statement, as 3Mr. Coleman did in his charge against Mr. Jackson, and it will be considered. If it is supposed to establish aprinrdfacie case a summons will be issued. It was then 4rrauged that Mr. Jackson should apply for a summons against Mr. Coleman to-morrow (Tuesday), and the parties left the coTrt. M3ARLBoROuG.-Snl ErT.-Frederick Reynolds, a clerk, of 7, Charlwood-street, Pimlico, and Arthur Wilson, of 48 York-street, were charged before Mr. BNGH}ir with creating a distarbance at Her Majesty's Theatre on Friday night, during-the performance of Jullien's Concerts. rolice-sergeant A 8 said that at 20 minutes past 10 on Friday night much disturbanoc, with all the danger consequent upon a socramble in a large concourse of persons, was occasoned by the elder of the twvo defendants, Reynolds, while in the promnenade part of the theatre, throwing among the people all round halfpence, and what appeaed *v=> w abtemptsuch~ a, gmeathti such a place.

A ring had been formed, and many attempted to pick up what the defendant threw down. As some of them stooped to do this Reynolds pushed them over, whereby much miechief and danger were produced. The other defendant, Wilson, assisted in forming the ring. On Reynolds being taken into custody, Wilson exclaimed at the top of his voice, "Nlto, no, gentlemen; d- it, don't let him be taken 1" and did all he could to incite others to attempt a rescue. Reynolds told the mXagistrate, in answer to the charge, that he really was very sorry, but in truth he only stooped to try after that which others threw; he had no intention to cause a disturbance or be a party to such. He wan very respectable, and held a situation in the citv; this being so, he hofied the magistrate would.be lerdenit with him. He regretted what had occurred. Ie knew nothing of theother defendant. Mr. BINGTAsr.-What is your occupation in the city? D1efendant.-I am a clerk in a merchant's counting. house. Mr. Stamford Felce, of 48, York-street. Portman.square, interceded for the younger defendant, Wilson, and informed the magistrate that he was of good fasilY, and the son of a general officer. lIr. BnqGHAM said he had no reison. whatever to doubt the accuracy of the evidence. The cbarge was clearly proved. It was an act of gross folly on the&part of Leynolds, he would not ay malignity.

Lord VIVIA moved:- " That aloyal and dutiful addss be presented to Her Na2jesty, ex. preseing a deire toa sidt In suppresing the rebellion in India.' lis Lordship, having alluded to the atrocious conduot of the Sepoys, protested against that cry for vengeance which had been so loudly raised by the press and too readily adopted by the psople of this country. He was anxious that justice should be done, but he was opposed to indiscriminate slaughter. He believed there were many of the mutineers who had left the British army from compulson, and therefore heG held with the Governor-General that it behoved us to inquire into the various circumstances be. fore we proceeded to pass a general condemnation upon the rebels. fe urged upon all classes that the bes8 proof they could give of their desire to assist Her Majesty to suppress the mutiny in India was to Induce young mean to enlist in yan am where rapid promotion was open to them. Mr. G. M. FoxmscuE, in secondlng the motion, replied to some of the observatious of Lord Vivian. He 8aid,-My noble friend hassad that vengeance mrust not be taken on those men. Vengeance we do not want; but what English. men call for, and what they will have, is justice. (Hear.) Why should we, in this country, seek to punish any man who, for the sake Qt gain perhaps, or in a hasty moment, kills his fellow-man, why should we deservedly infict on him the punishment of4eath, and yet hesitate about putting those mutineers to death ibo, with circumstances of maost cruel anid most brutal atroctty,j kdled their unarmed officers and best benefactors 9 No; re& mutiny and murder such as these be punished as they would bilin any civilized country.

-DRATBIPO:-.-HR I'XJUS MORI?[SON. , f . .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ! r h Jainef Maorionio -a§ildon'park; Berksbirek, ;oueD1 the " M rcthantEinlqeb".of the city. od, Lolldon,- died on Fiiday -aftenraona;.at bis icountry seAt,'where,di, . a declim g atate.of . health, lhe hatI ,.resided for som-e ean$.:. Mr. fM:oTrison was in the 68th year of his age, . In .mental character, and with inimense riches entirely self,acquired, , this great milliorajar. was a remarkable man. We believe Mr. Morrison was a native of Rauts; born of yeomran parents, originally of Scotch.descent. Early transplanted to this, metropolis at the end of the last century, the country youth .irst set foot in London, unaided1, in search of his fortunes. He was accustomed to say that he was thus launched in life and in the City, with no other means c,f subsistence than the principles and habits an excellent motherhad given him-an " indebtedness" to a female parent which most boys largely owe. His first. employment as a warehouse assistant procuired hina a bare maintenance; but his indus'try and trustworthiness soon secured a partnership in the Fore-street busines3 Pf the late Mr. Todd, whose *'daughter,he naaried. So. far it may be said his start in life was aecidents,l, but Mr. Morrison's constant rise in life was no. accident. His enormious wealth was the' reoslt of his own natural s5agacity; perseverance, and integrity. MIoreover, he possessed.the great faculty- of quick peetrationinto humanacbaracter, anid the tact of .attacbing to his various mercante concerns the aid of partners and managers for-the-subdivision of the labour of his establislments. His great merit was that he made the fortunes of many other city men. Throughout life this faculty of discovering andaplanting the right men in tht right places was more or iess carried out in all his applications of growing capital. During the long course of his devotion to trade and commerce Mr. Morrison's' mind never stoodc still. Every social change in business-in demand and supply-he keenly discerned and promptly acted on. Thus his great parent business in Fore-street has retained to the present time its lead among rivals. After the close of the great continental wars, and - the consequent rapid extension of -population and wealth, Mr. Morrison was one of the first English traders -who reversed his systeni of management by an entire deparftre from the old exaction of the highest prices. His new principle was the substitution of the lowest remunerative scale of profit and a more rapid ciroulation of capital, and, the success of the experiment speedily created his pre-eminent wholesale trade. " Small profits and quick returns" was his motto. Other houses soon followed in his wake, comparatively succeasfully; but the genius which originated the movement, notwithstanding active competitors, maintained its supremacy. The rapid increase and vast profits of the "dry goods trade,"' as the A mericans term cotton, woollex?y and linen goods, are illustrated by the warehouse palaces which, of late years, have been erected in London and in our great provincial manufacturing towns. t Almost within half a generation this internal and foreign commerce has been thus revolutionized. The result to Mr. Morrison in middle age was the accu3mulation of his large orig,inalfortune. His reinvestmnents of course were thenceforwards variously extended beyond L}s legitimate business, and his enterprises athome and abroad were attended by almost invariable success. For several years past he has been one of the principal purchasers of British land, his most considerable properties being in Berks, Bucks, Kent, Wilts, Yorkshire, and Iday, in Scotland. He had a " born interest" in agriculture, and few men better appreciated the real value of good and bad land. He measured rent by the nature of soil, the timber, the surplus or lack of - water; the numbers, character, and condition of the local labouring class; the distances between produce and markets; the qanturn of poor-rates; the commvtation of tithe; and the costs of land managemext. Acute observation,-calculation, and reason guided him in all he bought or sold; and if he foresaw a probable bad debt he took care to lessen, if not to " cover" it. Mr. Morrison, from his earliest settlement in London, was associated with the Liberal party in the city. At periods called "the worst of times' he was foremost in the ranks of the Reformers; nor did his later gain of immense wealth ever vary his - political principles and conduct in public. We believe that his first seat in the House of'Commons was his successful contest of the Cornish borough of St. Ive's in 1830. On the dissolution of Parliament in- 1831, occasioned by the Reform question, he did not return to his offended constituents, having honestly supported the partial disfranchisement of that small electoral body, St. Ive's being placed by Lord Grev's Bill in schedule B. In December, 1832, the first general election after the Reform Acts, he was returned at the head of the poll a representative of Ipswich, but was defeated in that borough on the " Peel Dissolution," January, 1835. On an election petition, SirFitzroy Kellyand Mr. R. A.Dundasbeing ousted, Mr. Morrison, with Mr. Wason, on a new election headed the polL On the succeeding dissolution, July, 1837, Mlr. Morrison remained out of Parliament, and on the following December, on the occasion of a " by-election" for a vacancy in Sudbury, he was defeated in a contest with Mr. Joseph Bailey. In March, 1840, he re-entered the house of Commons, defeating Mr. John Fraszer, in a contest for the Burgls of Inverness. In July, 1841, on the general election, he was again returned by his Scotch constituency unopposed. On the dimsolution of 1847, his health being much impaired, -he finally retired. It is scarcely necessary to record that throughout his political career in the British Senate Mr. MIorrison was a consistent supporter of the IAberal Administrations; his name was never missing in any material votes; his speeches were only occasional, usually on subjects of political economy, the currency, Poor Laws, trade, foreign commerce,.&c. In 1836 he made an able speech on moving a resolution relative to the periodical revision of tolls and charges levied on railroads and other public works. In 1845 he moved similar resolutions; and again, in Marcb, 1846, when he finally succeeded in obtaining the memorable select committee for better promoting and securing in Rlailway Acts the interests of the public. His draught report, not altogether adopted, was draw n up with great skldlland labour; and many of its Iprinciples have since been carried out in subsequent Ilegislation. All these valuable speeches and docaments, with observations " on the defects of the English system of railway legislation," were collected and published by Messrs. LJongman in an octavo volume in 1848. MIr. M'¢ulloch, in his Literatul1 e of Political EiZconomy, has mentioned this labour of MIr. Morrison in the public service with approbation, observing that more good would have been effected had legislation not been too long delayed. Nevertheless, in consequence, Government has secured powers, of surveiUlance for the prevention of accidents, and many increased facilities for the transmission of the 'mails. Mr. Morrison throughout his publc life was an advocate of free trade and a follower of James Mill, Huskisson, Ricardo, and Powlett Thomson. I Mr. Morrison, though a self-educated man, in manhood fully made up for any deficiecy in his early instruction. The formation of a library at all periods of his life was his favourite study; aU the subjects of inquiry to which he applied his strong cormmon sense and his sabtle mind he mastered, and he never converse(t or wrote on principles or data on which he was not well informed. He was a lover of arts and formed a large collection of valuable pictures of the old masters-Italian and Flemish; and also a gallery containing sorae etcellent examples of the English schools of paintig. Dr. Waagen, in his Treasures of Art in Great Britai, enumerates 30 pictures of Mr. Morrison in Harleystreet as of the highest value; and observes that "' the specimens of oostly plate, objecta in ivory, Raphael ware, and other tasteful objects are quite in keeping with the other works of art in this fine collection." The pictuires at Basildon-park the German critic also describes in detail as "a collection of a very high class." If occasionally "taken in"' he resold or exchanged. There was no trade of which he did not find out the trickery and guard himself against its consequences. It has been a fashion at times to decry a "new rich mau," and especially the self-created millionaire. The class, like all classes, has its weak. nesses and peculiarities of distinctive character; but antiquity of descent in no EuropearL country has a monopoly of position and- social influence. From the lowef class orig,inally springs the higher order, and ,the former. only can supply the declining complement of the latter. Intellect and industry will force themselves into the arena of social competition and the field of cosmopolitan adventure. All classes have their separate melits* and demerits, all their different gocial habits and manners; The men who are, born of tbemselves, and who cieate large fortunes, may be too apt to overvalue, the acquisition of wealth; and those ." born withi silver.spoons in- their mollths- will) too oommonly ispeid prodigally riehes ftey dinherit. But all clases shouldnot be judged in' their use of money ba commnon standard. We understand that. Mr. Morrison, to his honour,. has most equitably distributed his immense wealth and estates among the members of hi-s large family. In the; relations of private life few have surpassed him, nor had he really any v an y. in wealth, though he mig,ht, perhaps, .have better estimated. its worldly; value and uso. Ar. Morrison's accumulations may be estimated as nearer. four than three millions sterling, and a considerable sum of this prodigious private fortune is invested in the United States. In proof of his singular sagacity and foresight, we are informed that no portion of his: Transatlantic -capital will be ultimately, lessened by the recent temporary "panic" ' and monetary disturbance in that country. All his investments will "hold on" to la probable inerease.. The cautious capitalist never 'nets more profit than after times of nadional adversity.:
TfE AOOIDR.NT 2'0 " BIG BEN." (From the!Obsei2ve7-.)- As might be expected, considerable annoyance is felt in high Tuarters at the unfortuinate"acldeat which has occarred t*'g Ben," more espeeially as the 'quarter bells have just been compleied, and it wu anticipated that the clock and the chimes would .have been in'worklng order before Christmas; as it is, some faonths muit elapse befpre the mischief done cam be repaired.- It will be remembered that the bell controversy vas both long and hot; in fact, so discordant were the views of the scientific gentlemen that it was almost vain to hope for anything harmonious from them. We believe that at one time no wsde were their differences that they would nlot meet. When the present Chief Commissioner came into office it was one of his first efforts to bring these gentlemen to accord, and at length they agreed upon the size and quality of the belL The work was then =ntrusted to Mlesss. Warner, the eminent bellfounders. The belL when oompleted, surpassed even the most sanguine expectations. The scientific gentlemen were in ecstacies, and Mr. Denison regarded his work almost with the doting affection of a father for an only son. His grief at its untimely end may therefore be easily imagined. The cause of the acoident has not yet been determined. As soon as it was discovered that the bell was cracked, de. spatcher.were sent off to Mr. Warner and to Mr. Denison, iwho inspected the bell on Monday last. The crack La the bell rises, as stated in the Obsercr of last Sunday, perpendicularly fom the rim to rather more than half-wayap the side. The clapper and hammer with which alone the bell could be struck are those which are placed in and near the bell by the directions of the scientific gentlemen who were appoented to superintend the casting of the bell. There is no reasozi to believe that the accident was occasioned by any unfair treatment, as the bell was placed under the management of very careful officials. The probability isthat there was some slight flaw which was not at first discovered; and that thiswas the latent cause of thefrac-ture. This is not to be wondered at, considering the immensity of the work and the quantity of metal used. Those experienced in csasting pieces of ordnance, even, are well aware how frequently flaws wlll occur, and therefore it is not surprising that some slight defect occutred in the Casting which could not at fsrst be detected. Such accidents are of very common ocourrence.I'For instance, the celebrated bell at Montreal cracked during the first year it was used, and had to be recast. If any accident was to have occurred, it is fortunate that it happened before it was hoisted into its place at the top of the tower. Some have Imagined that in order to get a pure and harmonious sound the metal used was not so tough and hard as in ordinary bells. The founders and Mr. Danison are however of a different opinion, and believe that in their next production they will be equally successful as to tone, and more fortunate as to durability. The bell wi have to be recast, and it is not thought possible to have a fresh one completed under four months from the present time. Before, however, the orders are given, the Chief Commissioner of Works will personally inquire into all the circumstances of the case, and, for that purpose, will retarn to London on Tuesday. Hitherto, the whole matter of the bell has been under the entire control of the scientifio gentlemen alluded to, who had unlimited power to do what they chose. Of course, when accldents occur there are always persons ready to find fault and to atbribute blame; but in this instance we believe the occurrence to have been purely accidental, and which hardly any amount of prudence and forethought could have provented. The additional cost of recastng the bell will not be very great, as the metal is alheAdy provided, and it is understood that the furnace used for meltz the metal can be again made available. The four smaller bells have been tested, and give great satisfaction. In purity of tone they are quite equal to what " Big Benl" was in its happy and harmonious days There certainly does seem a sort of fatality attending the IHouses of Parliament; and we should think that Sir Charles Barry was almost in despair at ever seeing them completed. If he is not, however, the public and the Rouse of Commons are. But under the present Chief Commissioner there is some reason to hope that the works will some day or other be brought to a conclusion, and the little biU of from two to three mUllons settled; at all events, he stands pledged not to sanction the application to Parliament for a siDgle additional penny until the present works already decided on are completed. W-ith respect to the chime of bells, Mr. Denison is of opinion that when they are finished, and if the same purity of tone can be got out of the " young Big Ben" as was obtained from "old Big Ben," the chime will be unequalled in the world. It has been alleged that it was imprudent to have the bell used at all until it had been put into its proper place; there is, however, not the slightest ground for complaint, as, humanly speaking, the accident would just as likely have happened when the bell was fixed as now. The striking of the bell'every Satuday for a short time was done In deference to the strongly expressed wish of the public, who were desirous of hearing Its beautiful tone. Indeed, as matters have turned out, it is fortunate that it was so used; for if it had been fixed, and the clock put up and had then cracked, the whole of this expensive workc must have been gone over again. The clock is still at Mr. Dent's manufactory, and has been keeping most accurate time for some months.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The letter in this day's impression signed "X.,,, under the title of the ' Mild Hlndoo," induces me to for card you the following extract, which I take from a Roman Catholic paper called the Cataolic Telegraph. It is as follows, and is from a correspondent:_ " Let me not be misunderstood sz admitting for a raoment the truth of the atrocity cry raised by the British press. A very few yeam ago this same British press that now paints the Sepoys as' savages' and ' demons' painted the Irish people in preoiely aimilar colours. NTot very long ago 2The Timez newspaper held up the Irish priesthood to the execration of the world as ' a demon priesthood,' a ' filthy and felonious rabble,' ' surplioed ruffians' Before admitting the truth of a single atrcity story I must find It rest upon some better authority than an English newsapaper. .t.g I have given you a few out of the many reasons founded in truth justice, rehaon, and moraty which present themselves to my mind why I, as anrlalsfmn rnd Roman Catholic, cannot sqmpathize with England in her preet struggle for the oosubnugation of India. I ill be theanldlto you if you can present me one reason founded in trth, justice, morality or rWegion, why I, as an eshman nd Boman Catholic, should not. sympathle with Indiashould not pray bthat ohe God of justice vill send peace and liberty to her op. pressed and injured people-or Shy I should hesita{e to subecrnbe myself one who symp)ahiees with the cbauS of India." Perhape your Catholic contemporary will assert that the letter of " X" emanates from Prlting-house-square, the sentiments, houever, expressed in the above extrct are quite consistent with the testimony borne by the Late Coloael Arniere S. th Mountain, in the affemoir5 and ers lately reviewed by you. ribe writes:- " We have some excellent men among the olergv in India, and I should r y that a great deal is doing both to improve the natives and to promote good conduct among ourselves. Some of the Roman Catholic priests wrhom the Governmnent pays (the Irish) are downright rebels, and diO their utmost to foment dissontent among ousr Rornish t-roops; but their sucocess ls small, for our discipline is triumphnt, and ou syst such that, upon the w rhole the men are attashed to their ofiers." This opinion, though transoribed from your "rviewr," is nevertheless too true. Wmth suh hard wgorts as "temon priesthood," "Ifithy and felonious rabble," and "osurpliged rtffians" before us, it Is quite refreshing to readi the ild and gentlemanly letter ofm" Mr. Bag-shawe, late Eoman CatholicChaplain, Army in the East" (also in your impression of this day), wrho amits, notwithstanaing, teaet Roman Catholic priests are supported and paid by the British and Indian Governm ent. This is a great hoct, redounding to the credit of a free Prostestant Government. This support is now claimed as a right by the Rossh priesthood. I r ill now tell you, Sir, how that right has been obtained. The priest is first rent out, or ocupies a particular post ao a voluiteer, claiming no remuneration, When a footing is firmly established then representations are made and remuneration oaimea, and then, as in Mr, Bagnsawe's letter, comparisons *re made between the relative positions of the priest and the clergyman. But while the Roman Catholic priests claim as a right pay from our G}overnment, wrould it not be more consistent if they first unconditionally submnitted to our lawst Mr. Bagshawe's master is Dr, Wisemasa, a mana who puts at defiance thes express lAW of the land by assuming an ecclesiastical territorial tileh. When the Romish priest,hood in this country oonsent to submit to our laws, then it will be time for them to claim equal privileges with these who do. I am. Sir. vour ohedient pr"n*_ A LOOKBR.ON.
