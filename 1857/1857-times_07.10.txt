MONBY-MARBETandi CITYINTELLIGtRNCB. Thursday Evening. The Bank abstined to-day from making any alteration in the rate of discount, and the funds lave remrained without recovery from the depressed prices of the last two days. The settlement in Coneo]s passed over quietly, and at its conclusion- there wax found to be a rather large remaining supply of money, which was then freely offered on Government securities at 54 per cent The quotation of Consols throughouit the day was 92# to J. For the 6th of August the last transactions were at 92-a. At the close, perhaps, there was a little more firmness of tone, but it was checked by the arrival of the Parisprices, showing a renewed fall, consequent, probably, on statements that t3e return of the Bank of France will not be EO favourable as was auticipated at the beginning of the week. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92i to i; New Three per Cents., 92& to J; India Stook, 215 to 217; India Bonds, 10s. to 4s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 3s. discount to par. There were scarcely any applications for discount at the Bank to-day, the supply in the open market, in consequence of the payment of ,the dividends, being sufficient for all wants at about i or i per cent. below their charges. In foreign securities few transactions have taken place, and yesterday's prices have scarcely been maintained. Turkish, however, closed at an ad-vance of # per cent. Peruvian was slightly lower. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated, for the account, at 101; Granada Deferred, 6; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents.,for the account, 824, i; RuFsian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96O, k, 96; Sardinian, for the account, 894; Spanish New Deferred, for the account, 25k; ditto, Passive, 5; ditto, Certificates, 6t; and Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 951, 96, 96i. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 10c. for both money and account, showing a fall of a quarter per cent. It is evident, however, that there has been a preponderance of speculative sales, and hence there is some prospect of a rebound. The amount of gold taken to the Bank to-day was B2,0001. The bar silver brought by the last West India ateamer has been disposed of at 6lid. per ounce, being Old. below the price obtained for that by the prenious vesseL Business had, however, been effected at th'is, and even at lower rates, before the departure of the last overland mail. The dollars are not yet sold. The basis on which the amalgamation of the 2'oyal Mail Company and the European and Australian Royal Mail Company is proposed to be carried out is stated to be as follows *-Thn capital stock of the twocompaniesistobe fixed at2,000,0001. HIalf of this is to be represented by 15,000 Royal 3fail shares, at 661. 13s. 4d. each, which are to be regarded as fully paidup. Therpmainingl,000,0001. is to berepresented by9,000 uropean andAustralian Ehares, at 661. 13s. 4d., which would amount to 600,0001., and unissued stock for 400,0001. On the 1uropean and Australian shares 200,0001. has yet -to be paid, which will be called for by four instalmaents. These shares are not to receive any dividends for a year, reckoning from the 1st of July, 1.857', it being provided that any profits from the Australian service, together with the surplus profits f the Royal Mil Company after the latter have paid the usual dividend on their shares, shall be carried during that period to a united reserve fund. Afterwards both sets of shares wiUl rank alike. The conditions are subject to the approval of the shareholders of the respective companies, and also to a proviso for an extension of two years of their existing contracts being obtained from the Governmnent. Little expectation is now entertained that there 'will be any Australian mail arrival this month to supply the gap occasioned by the breaking down of the Oneida. The agent of the company in Australia contemplated despatching the Simla, supposing she should arrive in time, but there is hardly any prospect of that arrangement having been found possib!e. It was only by this means, or from the despatch of an extra steamer by the Bombay Government, that there could have been a chance of the receipt of later news from Tndia pending the next telegraphic accounts by the regular overland mnail. The Turkish Government, apparently with the best intentions on matters of finance, seemn timidly to permit themselves on all occasions to be made the sport of intriguers. In the celebrated loan of 1851 they aUowed their vacillation to inffict a heavy blow on the credit of the State, and then, when the mischief was done, submitted to a severe pecuniary loss, and showed that they had had no real desire but to act honourably. Something of the same kind is now being witnessed with regard to the establishment of a 2!Tational Bank. The necessity for such an institution was so clear, and the principles put forth by the Government so cautious and sound on all essential points,that supposingittohave beenpromptlyearried lorward with a vigorous hand, it might immediately have taken its place among the leading financial establishments of Europe. But the plan adopted was to call in at once a number of rivals, each of whom had forthwith a direct interest in crying down the scheme of his neighbour, and the inevi-table result was soon attained .of bringing the European public to the impression not only that aU the proposals put forth were more or less dangerous and mnsound, but that a Turkish National Bank in any rhape must be an objectionable investment. If the Government had simply formed their own view of what was required, basing it, as they appeared to wish, on the general experience of the Banks of F<rance and England, and had selected some single body of capitalists to act in the matter, the whole mndertaking would have been attended with dignity and success. Instead of this, forthe sake of a delusive -appearance of impartiality, and to make it seem that they are determined to get the most advantageous terms by encouraging competition, they beget aninterminable wrangle, and so damage the character of a movement on whicb, as it was their first essay in the sensitive field of currency credit, it was above all things essential not a breadth of needless disparagement should fall. With five sets of candidates for the concession, just as they favoured the pretensions of one they drew all the others against them, and thus there was a constant majority of busy capitalists, who, although hostile on all other points, were brought to harmonious action on the ene grand question of ridiculing and opposing the ;pecial scheme that seemed for the moment to be -uppermost. If the enemies of Turkey had been engaged to devise a ploS for defeating her most important aim they could not have effected it so thoroughly. A year that might have been the most valuable in the history of the country has passed, and all that has 'been established is the certainty that the project will mow not float at all, except upon much less favourable conditions for the State than would at first have been readily accepted. The various parties criginally stirring in the question were alleged to be Messrs. Rothschild, the Ottoman Bank (the capitalists represented by the Messrs. Wilkin), some French speculators of the Credit Mobilier connexion, and, finally, a combination of the native houses. According to the most recent accounts from Constantinople, the latter are now in the ascendant, but they have all had their turn, and there is little reason to suppose the affair to be nearer to a settle- ment than at any former time. Subjoined is an abstract of the proposals of this body, some of which, such as the engagement to keep the exchange at par for an annual payment of 23,0001. seem curiouas and perplexing. "NATIONAL BA?K or TuRxzy. *' Proposition3made by certainGreeck Bankers and Exchango D)ealers to the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan. " Art. 1. The Sultan grants to - the privilege of esablishing a public bank in the Ottoman empire, with the title of Ithe Bank of Turkey;' the shareholders to be mespansible only to the amount of their shares.

The Stat bonds shall be gradually liquidated, sEo that the prin. cipal and interest shal be paid off in about 15 years. "6. With the view of withdrawing from circulation all the debased currency known as beshliks the bank engages to withdraw from circulation every year, month by mnonth, and in 1.2 equal proportions, the sum of 75,000, 000 poiatres (576,0001.) of the cdebased currency, to be delivsred to the administration of the Mint, which, after verification, shall melt and assay it in the presence of bank delegates to prove their real valuae, and to coin them into silver medjidics, which shall be paid to the bank immediately they are issued from the Mint. '^The bank shall credit the account of the Government with the new silver money as and when received, in like manner as it shaU have debited it with the debased silver currency on the day on which it shall have handed it over to the administration of the Mint. *The Government, on its side, formally engages with the bank to pay it every successive year, aad according to its rconthly advances, the approximate sum of 30,000,000 iastres (230,0001.) to balance the actual deficiency resulting f'rom the annual liquidation of the 75,000,000 piastres of base currency. "' 7. The head establishment of the bank shall be at Constantinople. It shall have the power of establishing branches in all parts of the empire, subject to the sanction of the Government. " 8. The said bank, as well as its branches, shall have the exolusive privilege of issuing bank-notes to bearer, which shall circulate in manner following- " The notes of the parent establishment shall circulate freely in Constantinople, and .n the towns near the capital, and shall be received without any power of refusal at the Government offices of the said localities. They shall be payable in specie on demand at the office of the bank at Constantisople. " The notes of the branches shall be equally received at the Government offices, and shall circulate freely in each of the provinces, in the chief town in which there may be a similar establishment authorized by Government. " The notes put into circulation by the branches shaU be issued by the Bank of Constantinople itself, and shaU be payable either at the place at which they were put into circnu lation or at Constantinople. " The bank shall have the power of issuing notes for triple the amount of bullion and colU it shall have in its coffers. " The notes shall in no case exceed 10,000,000 medjidics (9,230,0001.). even when the bank shall have the entirety of its capital disposable in specie. " 9. The bank shall have at all times the right of sendin to the Mint specie and bullion, to be melted and converted on Its account as quckly as possible into Turkish money of legal weight and value, without any expenze to the bank, on condition that the Mint shall receive from the bank gold and silver of the following weight and fineness - "O ne drachm of fine gold of the value of 1,000 milliemes for I48 piastres.

"As the valueofocoppermoney varies, and its value cannot he assimilated to that of gold and silver, the Mint shall onl strike off a limited quantity, in order that no one shall tender for payment more than five piastres at a time. "11. The bank will not have the power to undertake any operations other than those which are permitted by the present statutes.

" The rate of interest for the ordinary operations of the bank will be decided from time to time by the Council of Government, according to local circumstances and the monetary state of Europe. "112. The bank en gages upon reeving an annu~al grant of 8,000,000 piastres (2$001OO)whiTchthe Government wil pay It yearly from the day of the foundation of the bank, to keep the exchange at 110 piastres the pound sterling, and for this purpose it wil be enabled to buy and sell bills of excbange on Europe until the period when aU the debased silver coin shall be entirely withdrawn from circulation, when the undertaking on the part of the bank shall cese, as also the subvention granted by Government, " 13. The directlon of the bank will be lntrusted to a governor, a sub-governor, four censors, andlS regents.

"27. Any change in these statutes must have the approba- tion of the Government and of a general meeting of share. holders, with a majority of three-fourths of the votes." According to a statement just issued by Mir. James Low, the shipments of specie from Enigand to India, China, Egypt, and Mlta for the half-year just ended reached 8,760,6411., while from the Mediterranean ports an additional sum was sent of 1,845,3991., making an aggregate of 10,606,0401., of which the whole was silver excepting 116,700!. In the list of specie exports furnished yesterday Messrs. oaggard and Pinley accidentally misplaced some figures, The total to India, Including Ceylon, should have been 5,639,910!,, against 4,018,0101. in the first half of last year, and to China 3,166,1801. against 1,168,6001. The an:ount paid into the Treasury of the East India Company for bills on India from the 25th of June to the 7th of July has been only 35,475!. The recent reduction of one per cent. in the rate has therefore had no appreciable effect. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day a petition was opened by Messrs. Linklater against -essrs. Evans and Hoare, wine and export bottie beer merchants, who failed on the 10th of June for 82,0001. The osition of the Welsh Potosi Lead and Copper Mining Company waw also brought under the notice of t;v 09u14 with A niew to obtain & W!t up,

1L WAY INTELLIGENKE. SOITTIT.'P,AqTV.T?-V- Aspecial meeing ofthiscomp uwas hold yesterdsysat tho BridgeC-hos iotel,to consider certin Railway Bils, in comp, ance with the stnding orderc of the House of Lords;- thc [Eon. J. Byng in the chair. - , I Mr. Smiles, the secretary, having read the noticoconvening the meeting, The CHAiIRtAN explained that the principal d 1ject t f the first Bill he had to submint was to authorize the oonL. struction of a relif line from the Greenwih.Junion. on the North Kent line to Dartford vid Bithamn, and was mnerely ca&rying out the original design of the N-orth Kent Rrilway, as sanctioned by several meetings of the company in former years. They had also to provide for the East Kent traffic. In the course of the proceedings before the committee on tho Bill, an under. tsking was gIvenby the directors to the committee, inacoor. dance with the intimation of the chairman, to the eff6at that the South-Eastern board would call their proprietora together, and recommend them to promote or concur in the prosecution in next ession of Parliament of such a scheme as wouldeffectually supply access tothe west-end of London, and so comsplete the system of railway communicationfor Kent and the continent. The committee then rejected the preamble of the East Kent Bill, and passed the preamble of thecompany'sBillforalinefrom the GreenwichJunction to Dartford, although they thought it might be considerably improved. He conssdered, on tho whole, that the decision of the committee was one of importance to railway provsietors generally, and, coupled with equally significant ecimons of committees in the present session, gave hopes of greater stability for raiway property than had heretofore existed. (Cheers.) The Somorron road the hseads of " Ailll to enable the South-Eastern Railway Company to nake a railway from the 2forth-Kent Railway, near Greenwich, to Dartford, and also to makmer complete a short line-at Tutbridge, and for other purposes." Tho time Allowed for the completion of the works was three years, and if not completed at the end of that time the dividendcs were not to be paid until the line was opened for trafflc. The authorized share capital was 255,0001., with the usual borrowing powers. The new shares may, with the consent of a meet. ing, havo a preference dividend not exoeeding 5 per cent. per annum. The CHAIRuI;N moved a formal resolution approving the Bill. A discussion ensued, in which Mr.G. Smith, Mr. Wright, Mr. Barnett, hr. Bell, and Mr. Adams took part, in the couse of which it was stated that the committee on the Bll had reduced the proposedaialificatlon for a director from 3,000!. stock to 2,0001., and that Lord Redesdale would not allow of a clause in the Bil authorizing a general meet. ing of the company to remove a director from the board if thought desirable by a majority of shareholders at sech 3meeting, unless provided for in a Bill affecting railway comn. Mr. 1. J. HERAPAT}I said heibelieved that the SouthWestern Railway Company had already obtained Parliamentary power for enabling a special meeting to change the direction, similar to that proposed by the South-Eastern Company, and which it appeared had been lost in the House of Lords, on the ground that it should be given in a general Act applying to all railway companies. A P]?opRiEToi said it was not the fact that the South. Western Company had obtained such power from Parliament. Another PROPBIoR said the South-Western Company had that power. 3Mr. BELL contended that the proposed line would not le a profitable one to the company, that it was badly selected and for the sake of economy they ought to get rid of it, ana by doing so they would get rid of the pledge to Parliament to come forwara in a future session to improve the line. He concluded bymoving an amendment to the effect thatthe further, consideration of the Bill be postponed for three months. Mr. G. SsTr hoped they wouald not put the fool's cap on their heads and stultify their own acts, as proposed by the amendment. After some pointed observations by Mr. RIcE, XlP., Ir. DENT, and Mr. P,tBuP= in respect of opposition fn Parliament, the armendment was withdrawn, and the motion approving the Bill was carried. On the motioti of the CaAnuurAw "A Bil to empower theStaines,Woklcigham,h andWoing Railway Companyto make a railway to connect the Reading, Guildford, and Ret gate Railway with the Great Western Railway" was unanimously approved. The CaRAiR1A2 stated that the next Bil he had to sabmit was for authorizing traffic arrangements between the West-end of London and Crystal Palace, and the London, Brighton, and South Coast, the South-Eastern, sand London and South-Western Railway Companies. He stated that the directors had struck out the permissive clauseb for I enabling the South-Eastern Company to subscribo funds for the parchase or otherwise of the West-endliailway, in accoWanoo with a resolution of the proprietors passed in February, 1856. He was aware of the inconvenience of the resolution, but the board were bound to obey it. A long discussion ensued on the propriety of having similar powers to other companies in such a Bill, bat as the resolution was passed at a very large meeting of the proprietors against sancioning clauses in the Bills of other companies for enabling the S3outh-Eastern Company to raise money, a formal resolution approving the BiU, with the ex. ception of ihe clauses referred to, was Passed. A vote of thanks to the chaiman and directors conduded the proceedings. GREAT WESTERN. A special meeting of this company was held yesterday at the Paddington Station, to consider two Bils now before Parliament, in compliance with the standing orders of the House of Lords; the H[on. F. G. Ponsonby in the chair. The CETTmzq having explained the oblects of the meetlug, resolutions were passed. approving a Bill for authorizing the London and South-Western Railway Company and others to mako deviations from their authorized lines of railway and other wforks; and for authorizing divers ot,her matters affecting that com any and other companies and undertakings ; and also a sill to empower tho Staines, Wokingham, and Woking Railway Company to make a railway to connect the Reading, Gaildford, and Reigato Railwray with the Great Western Railway, and for other purposes. The proceedings concluded with a voto of thalks to the Chairman. NEWPORT, ABERGAVENNY', ANDD EEREFORD. A special meeting of this company was held yesterday at the London Tavern to consider a Bill now before Parliament, in compliance with the standing orders of the HXouse of Lords, tho Ron. W. B. Fitzmaurice in the chair. lr. Farquhar, the solicitor, read the heads of the Bill authorizing the extension of the line to the Aberdare and Bu oed Valleys. The time allowed for the purchase of land was two years, ana for the construction of tho works four years. The directors were authorized to use the fands of the company for that ?rpose; and, with the consent of three-fifths of the shareholders represented at a meeting, to create preference shares to the amount of 135,0001. entitled to a dividend not exceeding 6 per cent. per annum, but not to affect existing preference shares. The 135,0001. would form apart of 180,000l. original stock of tho company that had not been called into existence. The CrAmaw moved ,formal resolution approving the Bill, which was seconded. A discussion ensued, in the course of which Mr. Cox and other shareholders opposed any further extension or the outlay of anymore capitaL Mr. Psaccx. I?., defended the course adopted by the directors, and contended that the proposed extensions were essential for the interests of the company, in order to secure a fair proporEion of the mnineral traffic in the district.

I ZRONMASTSEW QUARTERLY tEETZZN. BIRMUMG1AM, UErupmA7 Tho prelimnizary meeting held at Stewpony a 1* tujgh agO, at which it was mesolved to abide by the prioee of th laet Sarter, has apparently settlea the quotations of thOp ensung. At Wolverhampton yesterday. and in this town to-da,y, here was no giving way by the first makers, aud for beAt bars 9A per ton was exacted for delivezy at somnewhat distant dates. The prices of sheets, hoops, and all desorip. tions of manufactured iron were maintiuned in like prot portion. The attendanoo in theTown-lall was much more nutme; rous than at Wolverhampton, and the same hopeful feeling asto the futuro prospects of the South Staffordshire Iror trade was exhibited by the assembled ironmasters of the district. The reduction of the American tariff, whicL comes into operation during the present weelr has not at present Droduced any material effect upon the i3ritith mar* ket, and at the meeting to-day it was stated that Amerlcam bayers, of whom there were many present, had enter6d intc' extensive contracts for supplies of Staffordshire iron ab exsting rates. A great increase of demand, it is antic!pated, Vil occur in the course of a fewr weeks. The 'tockr§ inm the United States are knLown to be extremely low, an4 thes Wllm require to be replenished during the fall trade. The demand for home consumnption is described to be moderate but healthy. For hoops and sheets there is i eonsderable Slthougi not an unusually large call, and this is attributedi-ns oat degree to the briskness of tah branches of the niA trade. Tho settlements tof acmunts yestermay and to-day we generaly considered to be highly satisfactory. Hopes wera entertained that before the meeting broke up inthe Town. hall a further reduction In the rates of Bank of EnglaIl discunts would be announced, but this intelligence did ~no arrive. Such an event would, it ig understood, give an ad-. ditional impetus to the preset promising conidition 'of tho South Staffordshire irnt trade. Iron and limestone remain firm, and besat pigs mnsintali% the last advance. They now stand at 41,. 15s.pe ton, and are in great request. The mneeting at Sturb"ridge takes. place to-morrow.

" WHITE AND ANOTHER v. BROWR." TO TIE EDITOR OF THE TM S. Sir,-In your report of this action on the 8th ins. you: statethat "the questionwasthe right of the platit torecover the amount of a bill of exchange which had been received by him from the defendant in payment for goods, but which turned ouat to be of little valuie owing to thebankruptcy of the acceptor." We beg to say that this is incorrect. The action wan. brought to recover the amount of a bill of exchange-whiclz had been received by the plaintiffs from a person to whom. they had sold marble belonging to the defendant and other rsons, the acceptor of which had become bankrupt. Thetardship of the case against the defendant was that hiLgoods were sold to a person unknown to him, and whoes acceptance had never been handed to him, but which hal been negotiated by the plaintiffs. As the matter was compromised, we do not desire to domore than to correct the iupre-aion, which your report ie calculated to give, that the defendant had bought goods with a valueless awceptance, and we request you wil insert this letter in your columns, as the report may be injurows to our client. The case was peculiar, and we do not wonder at the reiporter misunderstanding it. We are. Sir. Tour obedient sevrmnta. July 9. THE DEFENDS ATTOENYS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES Sir,-may I request the favour of a small placo in your paper? I do so to defend the absent; and, perhaps, asbrother of the officer commnandiug Her Majesty's 60th Ridfer,. yon will not consider that I am asldng too much. I have heard it said, and I have seen the remark in print, "that Her Majesty's troops at Mecrat ought to have pursued the rebels, so as to have prevented them arriving at Delhi." It is astonishing how much better those who arat home inderstand matters than those who are at the seat of vvar. From letters that I have received from lMeerut,. and from men perhaps as capable of forming an opinion as. gentlemien in London, it appears that had the pursuit been continued the result for hleerut might have been mostdisastrous. One cannot be surprised, however, after the ungenerous remarks that were made in the House of Lords by a noble.- man in reference to the general officer commaudig the troops at Mceret, that the public should be hasty in theinjudiment. In justice to thoso now engaged on a service of all otherm. the most distressing to a soldier, it is but fair, I thinkL, to believe that Her Majesty's troops have on this occasion, as they have done on every other, acted with. energy and decision. 1 havetho honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant.

Hunn: MEctonum.-A meeting of the subsmribera to this fund took place yesterday at the Court-house, Maryle'one, to determine on the a?propriation of the fund. fLary FortescueIL G., who occupied the chair, as chairman of the committee which bad been appointed at the meeting; held at Willis's-rooms, on the 16th of February last year, for the purpose of erecting a public memorial to tho late Joseph Eume, gave an account of the proceed. iugs of tho committee to bring the sabject before the public.

TPARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. _-w :'OUSE OF LORDS, TuURSDAY, JULY 9. Tho LORD CHACxLLOR took his seat upon the woolsack e btt5 o'clock. Viscount DJUNGANNON gave notlco that on Friday, the 17th inst., he would caL the attention of their lordships to -the propriety and desirableness of havine a painting of tier Majesty's Coronation placed in the l{ouse of Lorda, and vould also ask the noble lord the President of the Council whether the Government conteniplated the purchase of the *original painting of that subject by Sir G. Hay ter. Lord CAMPBELL presented potitions from the membecs and seatholders of various Jewish synagogues in London. G'cagow, and other places, in favour of the Parliamontary Oaths BilL Also a petition from a body of merchants in BengaL praying for the improvement of the administration of the law in India. The Marquis TOWNSHBEND presented petitions from the Vestry of St. Panoras, the borough of Portsmouth, and tho seatholders of the Jewish syn'gogue of Portsmouth praying for the removal of Jewish disabilities. The Bishop of OXFORD presented petitions from the nainistar, churchwardons, and parishioners of Ashbary, in :Berl hire, against the Alteration of Oaths Bill, and also etitions to the samne effect from a parish in Essex, and from whoen ral deanety of Northampstead, in the county of Eail HOWE presented a petition from Sheepy, in the coqunty of Leicester, against the Alteration of Oaths Bill. ~SALE OF OBSCENE BOOKS, &c., PREEVENTION BILL. On bringing up the report of amendments to this Bill, LrO, CAMPBELL' said that since he last addressed their lordsbips information had poured in upon him of the most appalMi,,g nature, proving that the sale of abominable plblicratiwi s was carried on to an extent of which their lordships were lit:le aware. IHe held in his hand a book which-not to shcok the modesty of their lordsbips-would give their .lorr,l.i, sa notion of what was going on. It was a translationi :is Euglish of a novel by Dumas, jls, upon which the opera of La Trariata was founded. Now, he did not wish to erea'.e a category of offences in wbich this book miight be includtd. He lamented that such books should be circulated, but it was only from the action of public opinion and an .lmprcved taste that the sale of such works could beo r;couraged. He hoped niuch fromu the labours of tto Socioty for the Encouragement of Pare Lit rartre. Some of the passaes in the hook in question (whl,ich the noble and learned lord proceeded to indicate) rre,c. cI upon modesty and propriety in a manner that he - wcii'd refrain from describing. He was told that this work was ws,id publicly at all the railway stations. The publica lioL (i this work was not within the criminal law, but the :puhMllier had added a list of advertisements, which occupied 32 pages, and related to more than 100 publications of a amict abominable character. Several of these publicatioas he afl himself as a judge seen brought beforo juries, and declared by them with disgust to be of an obscene chaxacter. The first work advertised in this list was a work of tbis kind. It was stated to be "illustrated with numerous "oloured engravings"andadded "Thiscelebratedwork lasl had many imitators and no rivals; and it may bo said that for beauty of description it stands without a rival." It vwas formerly published at one guinea, but was now to be 'lad. at 3s. 6d. The publisher gave his name, which he would not publicly mention, but would content himself with .ltddixg that he lived in Rolywell-street. Now, if evidence tould bo obtained that suoh a book were sold and kept for sa'>, that would be a misdemeanour. He proposed by his .Bii? that the same course should be followed in regard to lhese abominations as with implements of gaming, uncus-to,ned books, and printing presses-viz., to give a power to zeasch and carry them away. His Bill at present consisted of one single operative clause, and provided that upon an .Sfadavit by the plaintiff that there were these obscene publications kept for sale or exhibition, and that they were of such a nature that the publisher of them was subject to a =nisdenieanour, the constable might go in and the books -1right be carried away and burnt or otherwise destroyed. '.Se trusted that their lordships would sanction his Bill, and he had no doubt that its effect would be most salutary. Lord WENSLEYDALE said he was requested by a noble snd learned friend who was unable to attend in consequence .Qf an accident to beg that the third reading might be fixed -for Mionday, when his noble and learned friend (understood to bo Lord Lyndhurst) hoDed to be able to attend. For bimself, he approved the amendments made in the :Bill. The report was then agreed to, and the Bill was ordered 'to be read a third time on Monday next. COALWHIIPPERS BILL. The ordor of the day for naming the select committee on hls Bill under standing order No. 175 having been read, Lord KINNAIRD moved that the order be disc harged Ctating at the same time that it was his intention to-morrow Io move that the petition of the coalwhippers be referred to a select committee. Lord RAVENSWORtTH said that since the noble lord spurposed not to proceed with his original siotion he should not object, after the decision at which the House had ar-ived a few evenings before, to have the petition in qaestion referred to a select committee. He should, on the contrary, do everything in his power to facilitate the innuiry before that committee, and should be prepared to show that thmo evils of which the noble lord complained could be obviated by means much less objectionable than thoso which he had rovided in his Bill. The ordor was then discharged. CROWFDED DWELLINGS PREVENTION BILL. This Bill was read a second time. OATHS BILL. The Earl of MALNIESBURY.-I beg to give notice, on 'ehalf of my noble friend Lord Derby, that when the motion for the second realing of the Oaths Bill comes on to-morrow it is his intention to move that it be read a second time that 4day six nmonths. CONVEYANCE OF REAL ESTATES. Lord BROUGHAMI introduced a Bill, theobject of which he said w-as to amend the law relating to the conveyance of real estates, and to establish a convenient registration in the case of such conveyances. The Bill, he added, would provide - an easy and expeditious mode of transfer of lands, instead of the diflicult and expensive system which now prevailed. The LORD CilANCELLOR said that, as his noble -riend had not entered into detail, he would not upon the present occasion discuss the question. Ile, however, begged to thank Iis noble friend for having introduced the aubject to their lordships' attention, because he believed that anyone who procurcd in any way the discussion of a question Eo inmportant was a benefactor to his country. .Even if the Bill of his noble friend did not pass into law during the present session, the discussion upon it, takon in connexioln witli the report of the commissioners, might, at a subsequent period, lead to mnost beneficial legislation. The Bill was read a first time. Their lordships adjourned at 10 mninutes before 6 o'clock.
HOUSE OF COMiVIONS, TtiWRSDAY, JULY 9. The SPFREEP. took the chair at 12 o'clock. The following private Bills wcre read a third time and massedi-ViZ., l ondon and South-lVesteru llailway Acts Amendment. Bill, Neersey Conservancy and Docks Bill, N'orfolk lEstuary Acth Amendment BilD, North-Western ~Railway Bill, and Taff Vale Railway Bil. REFORMATORY SCHOOLS B3ILL, Sir G. GREY having moved that the House should Zesolve itself into coilnuittee on this Bill, Mr. ALCOCR said that his chief objection to the Bill was that it was compulsory, and wvould therefore destroy the voluntary efforts now beiag miiade for the reformation of Oriminal children. The great success of the reformatory at Rodhill was chiefly oinvig to the gratuitous services of those 'who had established it. 1hl,e average expense of maintaining the children in that establishment and for repairs was last year 271. 6s. 5d. per head, and he might tberefore fairly assume that the average expenso of maintainiing the juvenile ^riminals now detained ill the prisons of the county of Ourrey would be 251. per head at the least, or 45,0001. on the whole, which was as much as the whole of the county rates of Surrey. The building of a reformatory for that county alone would cost upwards of 100,0001., and it would cost 1,800,0001. to suipply the united kingdom with refornatories. He believed that the Bill would impose great burdens upon the country without any adequate results, wrhile it would at the same time diminish the zeal of thoso who 'were rnow devoting themselves gratuitously to the reforma 'ion of criminal juveniles. It would enable the county magistrates to tax ratepayers in a most reckless manner. Be therefore moved that the House resolve itself into comzmittee on the Bill that day three months. Mr. R. HANIBtRY thought the Bill was perfectly unnecessary. No less than 31; institutions had been certified under the Reformatory School Bill passed in 1854, and 28 had been actuaUy founded. What would have become of the ragged schools if they had been placed upon the county rates'? He concurred with bis lion. friend the muember for Burrey in thinking that this Bill would strike a great blow at the cause of reformatory schools founded by voluntary sfforts, and therefore gladly seconded his amendment. Sir G. GREY said the observations of the hon. member Tor Surrey had no reference to this Bill; and in faot he approhended, after having listened attentively to them, that the hon. member could not have read the Bill. (A laugh.) The BiU was not compulsory. It would not compel the magistrates to impose ono farthing upon tho rates for these reformatories, nor would it compel the managers of them to receive aid from county or borough rates. The alarm sntertained by the hon. member for Surrey with regard to tho powers which the Bill would vest in the magistrates wvas unfounded. The magistrates were already intrusted with -very oxtensive powers with regard to gaols and lunatic asylums, and there was no reason for supposing that they wvould not exercise the powers to be given to them by this Bill as discreetly as they exercised their present powers. Me bad received representations from aU parts of the country that tho existing reformatory institutionsweredeficient, and - that a Bill of even a more extensivo character than the pre. sent should be passed. At the suggestion of the right lion. gentleman the member for Oxfordshire, he had given notice of a clause which he thought should receive the favourable - consideration of the House, because it would enable magis. trates to make arrangements with certified reformatory schools to receive from any county or borough a certain mumber of criminal juveniles upon condition of their being iriodicay paid for their Bupport as long as they remained n those sonools. That Olause would probably render -it unnecessary to establish separate istitutions in many parts -of the country. Mr. BRISCOB said that, frequertly as the BiU had been altered, it was still highly objectionable. It would take out f the hands of the present managers of reforinatory schools .all control over them, and vest it in the magistrates, and, in . aot, change the acheols into juvenile prisons. 'Sir B. KERBISON thought that the hon. member for furrey had greatly exaggerated the expense which the BiU 'woul occaeion. Be believed that the county with which he up c9pqgth Md whioh contained a populao of 537,00,migt costrct refrmaoryschool undier this Bmat an expenditure of 2,000o1. nRrtepaer ought bnto err tompelled to contribute to the reformnatioa of criminal children. Voluntary efforts should be devoted not to schotols for the reeformhation of criminal children, but to pre- Mr. HACKBLOCK supported the Bill but Mlr. BUXTON believed that it was 'uite needless. The public were quite willing to bear the burden of reforming the julvenile criminals of this country in voluntarily-sxpported reformatories, and ho did not think that the House ought to eate then of that burden. If this Bill vere passed there would he meetings in town-haUls, which.'Would be attended by the bibhop of the diocess, the lord-lieutenant of the county, and Dr. M'Nel, who would abuse the Pope. (Laughter.) A series of resolutions would be passed in favour of establishing large reformatories under this Bill, but he believed thai those reformatories womld not be conducted with tbat zeal Nvhich characterized the managers of the present voluntarily-supported institutions. The Bill would, no doubt, do a great deal of good, but it would, at the samo tiue, be the death of all private voluntary exertions. It would add to the heavy burdens under which the poor were almost crushed. MIr. M. MILNES regretted that the debate had been continued so long, as he believed that the observations which bad been made might very well bave been withheld until the Bill was in committee, and he should not have risen but for the deterujined spirit in which the two knights for the cotnty of Surrey had buckled on their armour against the Bill. They had said that the Bill would impose a great burden upon the ratepayers, but they ehould bear in mind that that very burden would, in fact, largely diminish the burdens now imposed on the ratepayers, because it would e i,ct a large diminution of the crime of the country, which entailed heavy public expenditure. They had aLso said that the Bill would extinguish all voluntary eflorts, but he knew that several of the managers of the existing reformatories were in favour of the Bill, and he believed that voluntary contributions would continue to flow in in aid of the reformatories which might be established under it. Sir H. VERNEY lived in a county in which no reformatory had *yet been established, and he would rather see that county without any reformatory than see established in it an institution entirely dependent upon the State, because he believed that it would feil, and also check the efforts of those who might be disposed to devote themselves voluntarily to the reformation of criminal children. He regarded the reformatory movement as one of the most interesting and important that had ever been started in this country, and should be sorry to see it stopped by the interference of ihe Governm ent. Mr. B. DEN'ISON had studied the subject for years, and believed that the Bill w ould effect incalculable good. lie therefore hoped that the House, wvithout further discussimn, wrould proceed to the consideration of its clauses in committee. (Eear, hear.) Mr. GAtRNETT said if the voluntary system had failed it mnight have been advisable to introduce this Bill, but he defied any man to say that it had failed. It had not disappointed the expectations of its supporters, and he thought that it ought not to be interfered vwith by a Government system. Mr. BAINES suggested that inasmuch as the amendment wrould have the efiect of altogether extinguishing the Biill although to many of its clauses no hon. member had offered or could offer any objection, the hon. member for Surrey ought to withdraw his amendment, and limit himself to an opposition in committee to such of the clauses as,he objected to. Mr. B&RRO'W contended that the BiLl was compulsory, at least with respoct to the support of reformatories out of the county rates, notwithstandingt what had been said by the Secretary of State for the Hlome Department. iHe boped that the Government would consent to abandon everything in the Bill which was of a compulsory character. Mr. PEASE, believing that none but voluntary efforts would succeed in reforming the criminal portion of the population, would vote against the motion for going into committee. Mr. GILPIN admitted that there was nothing so effilcacious in promoting social or religious objects as pure voluntaryism, but this was not a question between pure voluntaryism and State support, ecause the existing reforms tories had long ago consented to accept a p port from the Government. (Hear, bear.) It was therefore too late to soay that State-supported reformatories would check volun. tary efforts. The House divided:- For going into committee with by a Gove.rn,108 Bgainst. Majority .... . -131 The House therefore went into committee on the Bill. On clause 1, Sir H. WILLOUGHBY said he was opposedto the principle of taxing ratepayers for the support of reformatories, ad as the clause would enforco that principle he protested bor. UGESSEN opposed the clause, because it would in. crease the burdens of the county ratepayers, which were already too heavy, and would therefore bring reformatories into bad odour. After some further disenssion,the committee dividedf. For the clautse... of t149 Against it.1.. Majority ....,...-98 The clauso was then agreed to, as was also clause 2. On clause 3, In reply to Sir H. Wrnr.oucicy, Sir G. GREY said that the sam to be raised by the Justices in each case wouldn depend on the size of the reformatory, and be wholy in the discretion of the 3ustices. The clause was agreed to, as were also the remaining clauses. THWhe following new clause was added to theBill on the moion of Sir G. GrEY, viz. :-It shallhbe lawful formthe justices of the peace of any county in general or rquarter sessions, or at any adjournmnents thereof (notice baving been given as herein provided, in the case of a resolutionefor granting money) or for the council of any borouah having a separate court of sessions of the peace, at a special meeting of such council called for the purpose, to appoint and empower a committee of such justices or council to enter into an agreement with tho directors or managers of any re- lormnatory school certified as aforesaid for the reception and keeping in such school from time to time of offenders from such county or borough senutenced to be detained in a reformatory school, in consideration of such periodical pay. nfents as may be atreed upon with such managers or nirectors ; and such Justices or ceunGIl may direct the payment of the money which may fr.om tim to time become payable under such agreemuent. The preamble was agreed to, and the House resumed. BURIAL ACTS AMENDMENT BILL. The furthor consideration of this Bill in committee was postponed til Tuesday next at 12 o'clock. GLEBE LANDS (IRtELAND BILL. This Bill passed through committee. BUltY ELECTION.

BUTT objected to the clause as an infringement of the principle of law that no man was bound to crinminate himself. An innocent trustee might be subject to an accusae. tion under this Act, and the proviso did not altogether remove his objection, because, although a person's answer was not to be admissible ia evidence against him, it might supply the links of evidenoe that iglht convict him in a court of law. Mr. AYTRON belleved that this was the first Act which 'Was at variance with the acknowledged principle of EugEsl law-that a man was not bound to criminate himsel The ATTORNEY.GENBRAL said that if this clause were omitted tho statute would be uselesss (hear, hear), because, the mnoment a Bill was'brought in equity against a trustee for any breach of trust, even although it should not be fraudulent, he would have nothing to do but to say, "I might be brought within tho provisions of the Fraudulent * iustees' Act, andl I wil close my mouth and will not say one word." Bat the clause provided that no use should be Made of any auswer so given in any oriminal proceeding mider the Act. Mr. BUTT repeated his objetion to the clause, contending that it was not fair that a man should be compelled to ve an answer in a suit in equity which might afterwards rndirectly bo $ortured into evidence upon which he might beconvictodshould a criminal prosecution be instituted against him. The doctrine was one agairst which he most earestly protested as an innovation on our laws, and he should therefore deem it to be his duty to take the sense tf the House with epect to It upon a future occasion. Mr. BAINES maintained that the clause was calculated In no degree to introduce anewprlnclpleinto our legislation. It was quite truethat,inu ccordance with the rules of the common law, a man who happened to be called as a witness in a conrt of justice, in a case of burglary, for instance, was not bound to give an answer which might afterwards be used as evidence to convict him of participation in the ofrence. Now, the clause under discussion, on the other hand, provided that no person should be entitled to refuse to answer any question i a civil proceeding in a court of equity and his hon. and learned friend had very proprlyintroduoe that provision into the Bill, because,if he fiad not done so, Parties would constantly decline to give the necessary information to the Court of Chencery, upon the plea that to to do so would necessarily involve a liability to conviction upon a criminal prosecution. But, while his hon. and learned friend had taken that course, he had furnished an ample safeguard against any dangerone consequences which might be supposed o result from ib adoption, inasmuch as the clause set forth that no answver given ba person on a uit in equity should be admissible against him i any pro. seeding under the Act. Mr. MALINS concurred in the interpretation which had been put upon the clause by the right hon. gentleman who had Just spoken, and maintained that in order to facilitate the ends of justico it was highly expedient the clause should be retained in the BilL In iltstration of his meaning he might state that he had been the day before engaged in a case in which, after the death of his two co-trustees, the surviving trustee had appropriated trust money to the amount of 1,50W1. to his own use. When the caso camo before a court of equity he had been asked ff he had dono sO, and he had in asuwer ad. mitted the appropriation, thus saving ths Court ili further trouble in provmg the offence. If, then, the clause under discussion were omitted from the Bill the administration of austice, instead of being faclitated, would be impeded under Ate operation. Mr. BUTT renewed his protest gainst the principle i volved in the clause, observing that what to-day was only an experimaent might to-morrow become a dangerous precedent. Mr. COLLTrjER contended that the clause would in no degree operate as a violation of that principle of our law which the hon. and learned gentleman sought to uphold. The clause was then agreed to. Clause 11 having been put, Mr. CAIRNS directed the attention of the committeo to the case of a trustee who wlvtfully or through neglect had misappropriated the money committed to his charge, and had ben called upon by the parties interested in tho matter to make good the deficiency which his vioiation of trust had occasioned. Now, in that case the trustee might, through his own exertions or those of his friends, be enabled to replace the money; but then there was a rule of law which set forth that in the case in which to compromise any transaction might be an indictable offenco such compromise was itself invalid, and the party was not entitled to the benefit of it. Let himt suppose, for instance, that a trustee vilfully misasppropriated a sum of 1,000o. in violation of the provisions of the Bill under their, notice. might be that ho was willing to restore the money. or to compromise by a promise of future payment upon security. Now, the object of the Bill was to protect persons eeficlly interested in trust property, and any provision vhich tended to invalidate such a compromise would be injurious rather than advantageous to them, and he therefore proposed to add to the clause the words, " And nothing in this Act contained shall affect or prejudice any agreement entered into or security given by any trustee, having for its object the restoration or repayment of any trust. property misappropriated." The AT'TOREY.GENERAL said that if he were convinced of the necessity of such a Proviso he should prefer one more specifically expressed and accurately worded. Inasmuch, however, as he did not see the necessity for such a previse, and as the words, if introduced, would be perfectly mnnocuous, he would not object to their instrtloa In the The words were inserted, and the clause agreed to. Gi clausc 12, Mr. CAIRNS rose to propose the amendment which he had placed upon the paper. As the Bill at present stood a trustee, without any danger of suffering a conviction, migbt, from personal or other motives, be compelled to undergo the odium of boing indicted for a criminal offence. Agenitleman might become a trustee upon the occasion of a marrage. In the progress of time children might recult from that marriage and grow up, and family quarrels might arise in which it might be the interest of some onesor other of the parties to annoy the trustee. Under the presnt Bill nothing would be easier for such a person than to get up a case against the trustee, and upon an ex parke statement to procure his indictment at the Old Bailey, and subject n to the odium consequent thereupon. Now, how could such a contingency be checked? His lion. and learned friend the Attorney-General proposed tbat before any indictment could be preferred aainst a trustee the person who wished to press the indictment should obtain the consent of the Attorney-General and of one of the Judges in equity. Now, with regard to the first check, the duties of the Attorney-General were already so onerous that he would not have time to Investigate the cases which might be brought before him, and which would rest upon an ex pVart statement alone. Again, an equity judge, if asked to determine upon an cz part- statement, would consider it a most obnoxious duty, and would ref use in any case to grant his consent. The expedient which he proposed was a simple one. It was to give the judge the power of hearing both sides in the snost simple, inexpesive, and summary isanner, and of then determining where civil responsibility ended and where criminal liability began. In order, also, to avoid the chance of a person absconding, he would give the judge the power upon affidavit, which afforded a reasonable ground of suspicion of intent to do so, of granting a writ of neexeat regno. - Mr. BOWYER said, the amendment appearqd to bim to be an important improvement in the Bill, because it'aftbt4ed some security to trustees against vexatious proceedings. As the Bill at present stood, he believed it would be impossible in unie cases out of ten to find any persons to act as trustees, and it would then become necessary to assimilate the law to that of other countries, and enable property to be dealt with without the intervention of trustees. The law now imposed upon persons who fiUed this thankless office more responsibility and required from them a greater degree ol skiUl, exactness, and care than from any other class of persons. As a general rule, everything which a trustee did not according to the rules of a coUlt of equity constituted a breach of trust, and anything he omitted to do which equity said he ought to do was also a breach of trust. As to what these rules were, the most skilful practitioners and the most learned judges differed, nd therefore there was quite enough at present to deter people from acting as trustees; but if there were added to these burdens the dangers of a criminal prosecution, he repeated that it would be most difficult to find persons to perform these functions. The Bill at present exposed a trustee upon an ex parte statement, perhaps craftily and wickedly devised, to the preliminaries of a criminal prosecution, and a slur would be cast upon his character even if he subsequently proved his innocence. Against this danger the clause of his bon. and learned friend would, to some extent, and with certain amendments, guard. If in the course of any civil proceedings against a trustee it appeared to the Court that that person had so misbehaved bimself that the case was in. adequately dealt with by these civil proceedings, the Court i e such a case ought to have the option of directing a prosecutwin against the trustee. This was the true remedy tu bc provided. lio step beyond this should be taken, lest pru. ent men should De deterred altogether from accepting res;onsibilties which even' now were felt to be too heavy. Mr. COLLIER said, that the effect of the amendment would be that no criminal prosecution could be instituted against a fraudulent trustee without a previous suit in Chancery, and it appeared to him that a provision of that sort would almost destrgy the efficacy of the Bill, which had been brought forward'in a great measure for the benefit of the poorer classes. He thought that the clame proposed by the Attorney-General was qute sufliient for the protection of trustees, considering it to be more in accordance with the pinciples of jurisprudence iry such cases, if trustees were to be protected, that no criminal proeeding should be insti. tuteed aainst them without the sanction of a high law officer of the Crown or of one of the judges, than that there should be of necemsity a suit in Chancery in the first instauce. Mr., CAI NS said, that the hon. and learned gentleman, who ha(d no doubt a great horror of Chancery proceedings, Lad entirely misunderstood the effect of the amendment. All that the amendment required was that, if there had not been a suit in Chancery, a suit should be instituted. ("Hear, hear" from Mx. Collier. But instituting a suit was-th simpes thn In th Iod; it was merely placing upon a fie a piece of paper called a claim, consisting of only a few lines of writing, and, having done that, the suitor could go the same hour to the judge, tell him his complaint, and state that, in his opinion, there ought to be a criminal proceeding as well as a civil remedy. That done, the reat advantage of the amendnent becamea pparent, because the judge would then have the power of at once caing the other party before him, which no judge could do unless a suit were instituted. No expense and no delay would result from tho adoption of the amendment, Sir F. KELLY thought that some objection might be taken both to the clause as it stood and to the amendment of his hon. and learned friend the member for Belfast. (Hear.) The objection to the clause, and a very soand and reasonable objection it was, was that a trustee might have a prosecution entered and a true bill found agaiust him vithout ever having had an opportunity of being heard before a judge. It appeared to hini that a very slight amendment in the clause of the Attorney-Goneral would remedy in Pembroke Dockyard, for an increase In the scale of their superannuation; by Sir J. POrausR, from the medical students in Manchester, praying for a reconsideration of the duties and remuneration of the medical officers of Poor Law Unions; by Colonel GILPIN, from ratepayers of the Biggles wade Union, Bedfordshire, praylng for separation of financial from judicial duties ot county Justices and for establishment of county finance boards; by Mr. ALcoo], from Mortlake, against the two Ecclesiastical Corporations BDls now beWore Parliament; by Mr. Ev.sAs, from 1 medieal officers of the Basford Union, praying that the House will p ass an Act for the redress of their grievances; and byMr. COLVILE, from Edlaston, in favour of the better observance of the Ssbbath, and from Wirksworth, praying that County Courts may have jurisdiction in all cases in respect of wills not exceeding 3001. THE WAR IN CHINA AND THE INDIAN MUTINY. Sir J. PAKINGTON gave notice that he intended to. mnorrow (tbis day) to ask- the First Lord of the Treasury whether any recent intelligence had been received as to the proceedings of lier Majesty's forces in China ; whether the Gorernment had sent out any instructions empowering the Indian Government to divert from their destiny the troops sent fro n this country to China and employ them in India; whether, if no sush instructions had been sent, it was true that the Governor-General had, of his own authority, transmitted orders to Ceylon rhat the forces arriving there on their way from this country to China should proceed to India; and whether the Government were prepared to state, in the event of its being intended to divert these troops from China, what course they proposed to take as to the carrying on of hostilities with that country ? ORDNANCE SURVEY. The Earl of GIFFORD moved for a statement of the numLber of men employed in the ordnance survey of Great Britain and Ireland, inclading the establishment at Southampton, on the lst day of January, 1857, as compared with the number actually employed at the present time. The motion was agreed to. ORDEP.S OF KNIGHTHOOD. On the motion of Lord HOTrHAsx an account was ordered in detail of the sum of 4,6951. 10s. 7d., charged in the Civil Contingencies for robes, collars, badges, &c., for knights of the several orders; of the sum of 2,1361. 6s. 8d., charged in tho Civil Contingencies for fees payable on the nomination of eight general military officers, three admirals, and others to the dignity of Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath ; and of the sum of 3891., charged in the Civil Contingencies for fees payable on the nomination of several other officers to the dignity of Knights Commanders and Companions of the Order of the Bath. TEIE MAYO ELECTION COMMITTEE. Mr. SCaOLEFIELD, chairman of this committee, appeared at the bar with a report to the effect that two auithenticated letters hid been addressed to Colonel Higgins, the petitioner, in which it was stated that one of the witnesses, John Mi'Loghlan, who had been examined before the committee, had been maltreated since his return to Castlebar, and that John Gannon, who had also given evidence before the commaittee, had been so seriously injured by a mob of persons led on by one John Shoridan, that his life was in danger; and further, that such maltreatment and injuryhad been inflicted in consequence of the evidence given by these witnesses before the committee. The committee had therefore instructed him to report the circumstances to the House in order that such steps might be taken as the House thought fit. Mr. WALPOLE.-Before proceeding to the orders of the day, I wish for a moment to cal the attention of the House to the report which has just been presented by the Chairiman of the Election Committee of the county of Mayo. I understand from that report that evidence has been produced before the committee to the effect that two letters have been addressed to Colonel Higgins, stating that one Of the witnesses, named John M'Loghlan, who was examined before the committee, had been severely beaten, and that another witness had been so seriously maltreated by a mob led on by one John Sheridan that his life was in danger. The report states that this maltreatment was represented to have been inflicted in consequence of the evidence which the witnesses in question gave before the committeo. As the report is drawn that appears to be the allegation; but no particularproof of the maltreatment has been produced at present before the committee. I think, however, that the House, having had its attention called to the facts, should not leave the matter where it is without some inquiry on the subject (hear, hear), and probably under the circumstances, the best conrse that I can adopt is to obtain information from the Attorney-General for Ireland as to whether any intelhgence has reached him with reference to these proceedings, and if it have, whether he has taken, or is prepared to take, any steps in consequence of such-intelli gence. (Hear, hear.) Mr. J. D. FITZGERAID.-In answer to the question of the right hon. gentleman, I should state, for the information of the House, that, having in the course of the day heard of the production of the hItters referred to before the committee upstairs, my right hon. friend the Chief Secretary for Ireland communicated at onceo by telegraph to the Under-Secretary at Dublin, and that he received a message in reply,stating that an outrago such as that described in tho letters had been committed, and that two persons had been beaten severely; but the cause of the beating did not appear. It seems that the local authoritieawere immediately aotive on the ocourrence of tho violence, the stipendiary magistrate on the spot having arrested nine persons charged with being participators in the outrage, who are now in custody. (Hear, hear.) As I was expected to be in Dublin to-morrow the papers have been left there, awaiting my consideration, and I hope to be in Dublin tomorrow morning. It appears that the assizes for the county of Mayo commence this day week, and I apprehend that there will be no difficulty in placing those persons on their trial at the approaching assizes, and, if guilty, of bringing them speedily to justice, and I need not state that the penalty which the law in'dicts for such an offence is very severe indeed. In the meantime I think that the interposition of the Hiouse would be productive of great inconvenince, by interfering with the regular course of the administration of justice. (Hear, hear.) Besides, we have at present no evidence with which we can deal-it is a mere alh gation containedt in the letters-and the offence, so far as this House is concerned,would be, not the outrage on the individuals, but the fact that that outrage was committed in consequence of the evidence which they gave before a committee. That would bh a somewhat difficalt subject to inquire into at the bar of the House, and possibly we should be able to arrive at no satisfactory conclusion. In the meantime the law is strong enough to reach cases of this description, and to punish those who commit such outrages, and I wil take care, if these persons be gnilty, that the law shall be put speedily in force. (Hear, ha. LUNATICS (SCOTLAND) BILL. The LORD ADVOCATE having mnoved the second read ing of this Bill, Mr. BAXTER said he hoped that there would be no objection to the second reading, because he thought that no candid and impartial man could have read the report of the commlssioners, and the evidence on which it was founded, without coming to the conclusion that investigation was absolutely necessary, and that there was no time for delay. Ho greatly regretted that any portion of the people of Scotland, in their dread of centralization or of increased taxation, should have showni an inclination to treat lightly the evils wbich had been exposed by the commissioners; but, while he admitted, on the one hand, the evils that provailed, and the existence of a small party in Srcotland who were disposed to pass them lightly by, he contended that the great majority of the educated andlinfluential classes had evinced every disposition to deal justly and humanely with tho poorest and most to be pitied portion of our fellow-creatures. He feared that there existed in this country a serious misapprehension as to the true state of the case, and that it was supposed that the people of Scotland had altogether neglected the proper treatment of the insane poor. He assured the House that this was not the fact, and in proof of his statement he would refer to the report of the commissioners themselves, in which they stated that they had reason to believe that there was no country in proportion to its population which had done so much voluntarily for this class of sufferers as Scotland; and,although it might be said that she contrasted unfavourably with other civilized States in having no national institutions for the reception of the insane poor, yet that in respect to voluntary efforts she was entitled to honourable distinction. (Hear, hear,) He wished to speak with all possible rspeoct of the commissioners who had drawn up the report, because he thought that they had performed their duty faithfully, impartially, and thoroughly; but he could not shut his eyes to the fact that in their very natural and proper .anxiety to bring to light the abuses which prevailed they had not been sufficiently liberal in their commendation of the admirable chartered asylums of Scotland. What was really wanted in Scotland was an increase of the large public asylums. He held it to be utterly imnpossible to remedy the present state of things without erecting all over the country a very great number of large public asylums; and to do that was, he understood, the main object of the Bil. Whatever might oe tne case in other parts of Scotland, in that part of ehe country with which he was connected the evils to which the attention of the House was called were utterly unknown. In F?orfarshire there existed two large and admirably conducted asylums. He expressed a hope that the Lord Advocate would abandon the proposed temporary Lunacy Board, and place the inspection of lunatics at once, instead of at five years hence, under the Secretary for the Home Department, and this change would be attended with the advantage that there would then be a responsible Mlinister in that House to answer any inquiries which it might be necessary to make respecting the state of lunatics in Scotland. Believing the state of things in Sootland in connexion with the treatment of lunatics required remedy, and agreeingin the general principles of the present Bill, he was anxions to see it pass into law in the prosent session, but ho did not believe that that would be the case, unless the learned lord deferred to publli opinion in the matter he had just mentioned, for boards were not popular in Scotland. Mr. C. BRUCE would be glad to see a remedy applied to the evils brought under the notice of the House by the report of the commissioners, but perhaps he would be found to differ in opinion with many Scotoh rnembers as to the most likely means of permanently and usefuly remedying them. He begged English and Irish members not to consider themselves dispensed from the necesaity of attending to Scotch measures, because they were told that the Scotch members had assembled together in a private meeting and iven.their sanction to them. He, for cue, saw no ground for creating a new board in reference to this subject. He believed that the commission had alrowd itself to be carried away by exaggerated statements; but, nevertlaless, whatever case their report mlght make against private houses, it was, as regards the puble asylums, highly favour- able to Sootland. There was no doubt that in some instanes. the commissioners had exaggerated the existing evil, having taken the number of insane poor, not from the Poor Law Board, but from tho reports of constablos1 sd hvinmg col. lected together all sorts of stories from dinfient parts of the country. By the present Bill a new board was to be evpointed, and the Board of Supervsion was entirely passes' by. Why was that done? He believed that the Board of Supervdisio had 3not neglected its duty, for from the first it ba uniformly called attention to the deficiencies i- its power. It was, then, the duty of the Governrment ten to have given it increased power. In 1852 the attention of the Lord Advocate who held offico under Lord Derby's Adminis ron was caUed to the condition of the lanatic poor in Scotlalid, and he addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Scotch Poor Law Board, requesting to be informed of his views as to the existing evils, and the remedies which he thought it desirable to adopt. Be (Ir. Bruce) regretted that on a former occasion the hon. member for St. Andrews (Mr. E. Ellice) had made some very severe andunjust charges against the distinguished cbairman of the Board of Supervision in Scotland, Sir J. M'Neill, to whom, in his opinion, the country was under great oblgation for the manner in which he had discharged his difficult and important duties. He (Mr. Bruce) did not think it possible that so voluminous a Bill as that now before the House could receive adequate consideration during the present session, but powera might, without difficulty, be conferred upon the Board of Snpervision which would enable them to provide for the satisfactory administration of the law. He believed that if two inspectors were appointed, who if it were thought desirable might report directly to the Secretary of State for the Rome Department, much would be done towardsremedying the evils which wvere now complained of. In reply to the application of Lord Derby's Lord Advocate the late Secretary to the Board of Supervision said that it was almost impossible to put an intelligible construction upan many portions of the existing statutes relating to lunatics, and that the codification or embodiment of the law in one Act of Parliament would be a great advantage. The Secretary further stated that the condition of pauper lunatics had undoubtedly been much ameliorated during the last 10 years since the Poor Law Act had been in operation; that duiing the inquiry which took place in 1844 many cases of a most painful nature were brought to light, such as the chaining of lunatics to trees, or their confinement in a sort of cage; bot that measures had since been taken by the Board of Supervision to prevent such proceedings, and to provide for the due administration of the law. Half-yearly returns, containing the names of persons chargeable as pauper lunatics, accompanied by medical certificates, were now required by the Board of Supervision from every parish, and when lunatics were placed in asylums the jurisdiction, as well as the responsibility, passed to the sheriffs. He (Mr. Bruce) thought it was importan' that efficientb officers and more ample accommodation should be provided. Re considered that it would be impossible to pass this Bil in a satisfactory form during the present session, and if it was hurried through the House it would be found necessary at a future time to propose another measure for its amendmnent. Mr. DRUMMOND said, as reference had been made by his hon. friend the member for Elginshire (Mr. C. Bruce) to a meeting of Scotch members held on Friday last to consider the provisions of this Bill, he would take the liberty of telling his hon. friend and the .,Touse that meetings of Scotch members were not always beneficial, even to the interests of Scotland, for he remembered Lord Rutherford telling him that it wvas by a meeting of Scotch members that his Bill, which was a very excellent one, was entirely destroyed, and that after that he found it utterly hopeless to attempt to carry it through the House. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman would leave everything to the care of these Poor Inspectors. Why, they were the main cause of all the mischief that had occurred, and it was the frauds they had committed on the poor that had rendered legisla. tion on this subject necessary. But then, it was said, they were popular in Scotland. Popular with whoml Why, popular with the " lairds" (a laugh)-popular with the ratepayers and men like the doctor who had been referred to, and who was afraid to tell the truth for fear he should incur the censure of the ratepayers. They wore totally incompetent to perform the functions assigned to them, and it was suspected that those were the same gentlemen who opposed Lord Rutherford, and who had prevented anything being done for the last 10 years. Now some hon. members objected to the proposed Lunacy Board for Scetland. He was not standing up for any board at all. He contended they would never have the care and treatment of lunatics in Scotland prorerly regulated except through the instrumentality of experienced Lunacy Commismoners, such as we had in this part of the kingdom. But he would say let there be any machineryrather than that things should go on as they did now. (Hear, hear.) The impression created throughout the country by the report of the Scotch Lunacy Commission, as lately brought under the notice of that House, might be a short-lived one. He suspected there were not many persons who had read that report. Be that as it might, he would say-" Strike when the iron is hot." (Hear, hear.) There was no mau in that House or in Scotland who dared to vindicate the things which were stated in that document. So long as there was not some person whose special duty it was to inquire into those things there would never be a remedy applied, and therefore it was absolutely necessary to have some machinery organized with the view to a remedy. It was not, however, for machinery that he contended, but that somethingshould be done for the immediate and permanent protection of these poor and ill-treated people. Letters had recently been sent to him from Scotlard on this subject, written on the part of the poor, which gave it a very melancholy aspect. He said the treatment of the poor in Scotland was scandalous. (Anironical "Hear, hear.") Yes, he repeated, it was scandalous, and he warned the House against being led away by the cant that they were breaking down the spirit of the poor, by saying that they should support thens1ives. Support themselves! 'It is a perfect mockery. It is bad enough in England, but it is ten times worse there; and he should like to see another commission Eent down to Scotland to see how the poor fared there, just as a commission had been Eent to see how the unfortunate lunatics were treated. (Hear, hear.) Mr. H. JOHNSTONE, who was very imperfectly heard, was understood to say that in the part of Scotland (Damfriesshire) which he represented the only real objection felb to the provisions of the Bill of the Lord Advocate had reference to the constitution of the Board of Commissioners in Lunacy. The leading men in that part of the country who had given their attention to this subject would be perfectly satisfied with the most stringent inspection, and they wished to see the most complete publicity. They desired to see the proposed inspectors appointed, but, at the same timo, to hold direct communication with the Secretary of State ; and if a change of that kind were made in the Bill he believed it would meet with general approvaL The hon. member was also understood to say that in the part of Scotland with which he was connected there was an asylum conducted on the maost admirable principles, which afforded very excellent accommodation, so far as it went, for pauper lunatics, and he wa authorized to state that the trustees of that institution, at the suggestion of a benevolent lady, who took much interest in ameliorating the condition of this unfortunate class of persons, had passed a resolution by which accommodation for upwards of 200 additional pauper lunatics would be provided. (Cheers.) olonel SYKES complained that a vast deal of odium hadbeen thrown on the Board of Supervision for acts of cmirsson and inefficiency over which the able man at the I cad of that hoard had no control, and for which he was not responsible. That, however, appeared now to be the usual fate of the mos distinguished publc servants both at home ar.d abroad. He would remind the House that the Board of Supervision had annuaUy reported to Parliament and stated grievances which called for a remedy. But that board had no power to act. It rested entirdy with the Secretary of State or the sheriffs of counties to carry out the recommendations which wvere made by the board from time to time. That a state of things existed as regarded pauper lunatics which demanded a remedy there could bc little doubt; but the duty of applying that remedy, he repeated, devolved on the sheriffs of counties throughout Scotland, and not on the Board of Supervision. He had no hesitation in saying that there was throughout the whole of Scotland an earnest desire that the unhappy people aff:icted with lunacy should have the greatest amount of care bestowed on tbem consistent with the power of local controL The county he represented tad one of tbe best asylums in the country, and the authoritics connected with it invited inspection; but what they did n!,t want was the interference which would disgust those who were voluntarily giving their money and their time to the care and relief of those unhappy people. (Hear, hear.) Again, the asylum at Perth was managed with all the care of a private family, and had been productive of the happiest results. e held ian his hand a newspaper called xeckior, which was got up by the so-called mad people there, and in which were several papers translated from German and French into English; and he assured the House that he sawfarless indications of madness in that little sheet than he had seen in newspapers with which the community was daily fatmliar. (Laughter.) He took exception to the board contemplated by the Bill; but if the counties were compelled to build asylums in whih pauper lmatics could be located and if the inspection of them could be made by pensons sent directly from the Lunacy Commissioners in London, or from the Secretary of State for the Home Department5 he should give it his hearty concurrence. hIr. WRHITBREAD thought that the easiest way of effecting a revolution in the treatment of lunatics in Scotland was to attack the pockets of those who committed such ahtrocities as had been reported by the commissioners. The reason given for not proceeding for penalties, that there was no power of mitigation, oughtnottohave prevailedinthe case of Hill-lane House, near Greenock. The receipts in that instance must have been 1,5001. or 2,0001. a-year, and a penalty of 2001. forthe dreadful maltreatment of the inmates which had been disclosed could not be said to be too great a punishment. (Hear, hear.) Mr. B. ELLICE, jun., complalned that the reports of the Board of Supervisiop did not showv that such a state of things existed as had been proved by the commission. He attributed it, in a measure, to the constitution of the board. Where there was one paid officer and many others unpaid, the duties fell almost entirely upon the paid officer, but he could not acquit the head of the board for not having written to the Government, and said he would no longer be responsible for duties which he had not tbo means to perform. He dissented from the suggestion of the hon. member for Aberdeen to have inspectors come to Scotland from tbo LunaCy Board in London. It would be centralization with a vengeance, and most distasteful to the people of Scotland. At the samo time he was aware of the objections to a new board in Edinburgh, and he had come to the conclusion that all the evils might be remediod without having recourse to it. The three great objects of legislation were-first, the establishment of proper asylums ia which pauper lunatics could be kept; secondly, proper inspection, not only of those asylums, but of every placo in which lunatiecswereconfined thirdly, powoerintheBoard of Supervision, under certain circumstances, of exempting pauper lunatics from confinement in asylums-a power which he thought should be reserved-and some guarantee that such exemptions would not lead to abuse. (Hear.) He intended to leave the whole responsiblity with regard to the details of the Bill auon the Government. Discussionof the details would be perfectly useless, and would bazard, in point of time, the passing of the measure. He thought it ws of tho utmost possble importanoe that tler-o hould be legislation uaoZ the gubject, and that an Act should be passed ins the present session. He thouwht that no inconivenience would result from passirng the Bill now, andl if from experience they found that aruendmsents were necessary a measure for that purpose c.ould he introduceed next year. la the neantimne A new s3 tem would be inaugurated and a basi haid upon irhich actiL'n could he taken immediately. (Hear, hear.) The poiit upon whbich he felt the greatest anxiety was that relating to the appcdtmonient of insp,ectors. He wias bound to say that the Bill had been greatty improved in that respect, but it still 'provided for the pertuauencv of the central board in a,way which he could not appro~ve. He disliked centralization, about which the peoplo were so justly jealous, and could niot see what they wanted with a, hoard in Edinburgh t~ interfere, beyond simsplec inspection, with the different local authorities, who were charged by the Bill with the duty of carrying out its provisions. All that was required and desirable was to lay downt what the law should he, to say what the counties should do, and then to take care that the Act was properly enforred. There shoulcl be two general Jinspectors-.he did n* t like the name of comm lsoners-with no power beyond an absolute right of inspection at all times, andL under any circumstances, hut -with the iniperativo obligatiozn of visiting every place in which lunstics were confined. If they found that the law was not carried into efrect In these as3lums, they should be empowered to call upon the local authorities to discharge the duty incumbent upon them, and, in the event of the latter refusing to doso withina~ reasonable time, they should then make a representatioa to the Secretary of State. under whose authority legal proceedings might betaken,~if necessa;ry, againstthe offending parties. A provision of tha%tkind would, hethought, prevent undue interferenee witha the local authorities, and protect the central beard against that jealousy which it might otherwise excite th.oughout the country. (Elear, hear.) Again, there must necessarily, in the first instance, be a good deal of negotiation and correspondence with the different counties in ScotlanLd relative to the erection of asylums, and he thought it would be desirable to have, in addition to twro paid general inspectors, three unpaid miembers of the central board, for the purpose of carrying out the preliminary arrangements. In this respect, also, the Bill had beon greatly improved, and he was not unwilling to take it as it now stood. (Elear, hear.) Another miatter to which he wished to direcit the attention of the Elouse was the combination of counties. He thought that, lintead of ha-ving the counties divided into districts, as proposed hy the Bil, the principle of the Poor Law Actought to be ad6pted. Let every-county betold that it would be required to provide a certain amount of accommodation for its pauper lunatics, either by bufilding anL asylum for itself, or, if it thought fit, entering into a voluntary combination with other counties ,for the purpose of erecting an institution for their joint use. That wouldt be muchi better than taking counties anid placing them arbitrarily in districts. He thought, also, that there should he some power of detachingpasrts of counties and annexing them, for the purposes of the Act, to other counties. Some of the islands belongig to the counties of Inverness and Ross, owin- to their communicationr with the south by sea, would fin3 it more convenienit to sendl their lunatics to Greenock or Glasgow than to their own districtI asylums. (Hear, hear.) Hle likewvise hoped that some provision would he inserted ina the Bill with respect to medical men, whose position as connected with pauper lunatics, and, indeedt pauperism generally, called loudly for theinterference of the Legislature. At the time that the corn laws were repealed, when it was supposed that that meascre would be injurious to the proprietors of laud in Scotlaud, Sir Robert Peel made a grant from the Consolidated Fond of 10,0001. a-year towards the payment of maedical officerrs. 'Under these circumstances he thought that the Government ought to fix a minisnums allowance, which the parishes should he hound to provide. (Hear, hxear.) An hon. xamcci ber had called the attention of the Lord Advocate to the necessity of proceeding against those keepers of asylums wvho had, in contravention of the law, illtreated and neglected the wretched creatures intrasted to their charge. He trusted that the hon. and learnedl lord would consider the proptriety of making some examples which would beoa terror to the rest. (Hear.) He wanted to know, also, what was to be done now wvithi thoso lunatics who camne under the superintendence of the sheriffs and the Poor Law authorities-those who were confined in workhouees and allowed to mix with the other pauper inmates, those who were permitted to run wild in their parishes, and those idiot women who were rapidly increasing the population by the birth of idiot children. If the Board of Supervisionx were instracted to insist upon decent allowances being given for the maintenance of these pautper lunatics, he had no doubt that the state of things described in the report, of the commissioners would soon pass away, because af ter all, the question was merely one of poUnds, shillings, and pence. In the case of outdoor lunatics naothing more was requiredthan the enxforcement of the existing lawv, and he believed that, had it not been for the negligence of the sheriffs and the Board of Super. vision, nine-tenths of all the evils denounced by the commissioners might have been prevented. (Hear, hear.) He felt gratefnl to the right hon. gentlemanL for introducing the BUil, which, subject to the amendments of which notice bad been given, he thoughit would be useful; and, although theupresent Bill was not and could not be perfect, yet there would be ample opportunity next sessionx to pass a mnore complete measure. Before sitting down he wished to make a statement for tlso satisfaction of the Sheriff of Orkney, who had felt himself aggrieved by a certain statement which had been made upon the comnmissioners' report. The case ref erred to was that of a femiale pauper lunatic removed from Ozkney to .Edinburgh, and who, upon. her arrival at theo latter place, was found to have all her ribs broken, anad was altogether so severely injured as to endanger her lIfe. The woman made a declaration that the injuries hr I been inalicted by the gaoler of Kirkwell Prison. There was no doubt that the woman had been grievously illtreated somewhere, but it appeared from inquiries instituted by the Sheriff of Orkney that she was mnistaken in attributing them to the gaoler at Kirkwall, who was represented to be a humane man, and not at all likely to behave so brutally. The poor woman had, therefore, been maistaken as to the place where shiewas illtreted, but the fact remained that she had been illused somewhere, and therefore the deduction from that case remained unaltered-viz., that there did exist at present grss neglect int the supervision of pauper lunatics in Scotland.r Mlr. BLAXIKBURNT regretted that the correspondence with the Boardl of Supervision was not before the House, as the instance just mentioned by the hon. member for St. Andrew's (Ur, Ellice) proved that the statements in the report of the Lunacy Commissioners were in some cases incorreot. The Board of SupervisionA had, immediately after the report was putblished, set abouxt inquiring into the truth of the statements contained therein, and, as far as they had been able yet to ascertain, those statements were even more erroneous than they had e-xpected to find them. Of the four cases which hiad been specifically mentioned, the Board of Supervlidon found that in two of them the parties were not 'unatics at all, le hoped the Secretary for the Home Department would not object to lay before the House the correspondence which hatd taken place with the Board of hSujervision. The right hon. gentleman hiad consented to produce the correspondence witli the sheriffs, which wvouldl show how many mistakes% the commissioners had made. It, niowever, appeartd. to him (Mir. Blackbunm) to be dangerous to legislate upon the information of a report which was admitted to he ini several instances very incorrect. He agreed that something should be done, that asylums should he built (hear, bear), and that there should beaa proper inspection of all asylums and private houses. Blame had been imputed to Scotland for stinginess in not providing these asylums, but there had been oflate a great increase in the lunatic wards attached to workhouses. With respect to the Bill itself, he should not object to a central board if deprived of the power of coercing the counties,.lie thought power should be given to counties to combine in order to build an asylum jointly, and a central hoard to whom they couldl refer for adviceennd exhibit their plans would be of some use. He would only add that the hon. member for Elginshire (Mr. C. Bruce) appeared to have been misunderstood,as that hon. gentleman did notobjeetto the building of asylums (lhear), but to the board as proposed in the Bill. If the right hoe, gentlemian (the Lord-Advocate) would carry ouit the, amiendmaents of which he had given notice, lio (Mr. Blackburn) should not object to the second readting. Sir GP. GREY wished to explain the reasons why the correspondence with the Board of Supervision had not been laid before the House. A' few days since he received from that Board a report which'it was his intention at once to have laid upon the table of the House, but upon looking over the statement he found some passages which, according to the rules of the House, ho conceivecd would prevent its being laid upon the table. He submitted-the matter to the highest authority (the Speaker), who at once confirmed his doubts, and therefore he (Sir GP. Grey) returned the docuiment with an intimation that upon an amaended statement being sent he would be gla to lay it before the House. The re-ason for seniding back the first statemaent was that it contained distinct references to the debate which took place in the House uapon the presentation ofthe comaliassoners' report. At the samne time that he admitted the Commissioners of Lunacy were in some instances in error, which was not unnatural considering the extensive and complicated. nature of their duties, he did not at all intenid to admit thst the general statements in their report had been so impugned as to render legislation unnecessary or to diminish the necessity for immediate action. Uponi this subject he was gratified to find there was t-o be no opposition to the second reading o1f this Bill, the explanation of the details of whichh oshould leaveto the Lord-Advocate, simply remarking that in his opinion a central heard would be necessary in the first instance, at least, to set the nmachinery in motion. He could not agreeI pulsory power to re4uiro the erection of asylums. That power had been found to be necessary in England, and was equally necessary in Scotland. He agreed that counties should be permitted to combine to build asylums, but the great object of the Bil was to provide sufflcient accommodation for the unfortunate class to whom it referred. Beforo sitting down he felt it due to Sir J. 'Neili, the President of the Board of Supervision, to express his concur. rence in the observations of the hon. member for Elginshire respecting that gentleman, with whom he (Sir G. Grey) had had frequbnt comnunications, especially during the period of the distress in the Hui2hlands, and from that intercouse he bad been led to form the highest opinion of Sir J. 'WNeiI's humanity, and of the zealous manner in which he discharged IIis important duties. (Hear, hear,) Mr. W. EWART thought that, with an efficient system of inspection, the local boards might do all the duties that weme necessary, witbout the intervention of any intermediate central board whatever. It was impossible to deny the necessity of the measure nowbefore tho House, and he would vote for the second reading, but at the same time he hoped that as much encouragement would be given for local management as was consistent with the working of the machmery of the Bill. Msr. DUINLOP expressed the great gratification which he felt at seeing something like a remedy proposed for those painful and harrowing evils which were so discreditable to Scotland in connexion with the treatment of panperlunatics, He had the highest confidence in the commissioners, and no supposed inaccuracy in this roport should for a moment be made to stand in the way of legislation. It was impossible but that cruelty and il-treatment must have taken place when they considered the way in which paupor lunatics were bearded out in oonntry disricts. Personally lhd would have p referred a system of efficient inspection withouttheestablishmentof anycentral beard,hbut there might be good reasona why, for- the present ae least, that board should be appolnmTE, and ho would not give it any opposition. He rejoiced tl,at another sesson was not liktly to pass over withoUt s pesthinIg being done to remove wha was at once anationsil calamity and anational cri.mo romn Scotland. (hear, hear,) The LORD ADVOCATE said they were xubsrtaritialUy unanimous upon Ibis question. Even on points where. difference of opinioa was expressea it woul he found to be mnore in worcla thaun in substance. (Eler.) The bon. zt..ember for Elginshire (Mr. Bruce) was undera mistAks in his estimate of the p,articular clause to which he referred. Thegreat object inviewwas toobtaiacmoa tion for pauper lunatics and additional m etin aommodath question W1ss hew that could be best carried into effect. It wsinthe first' plaoe, suggested that the duxties in be dscharged -ae teBill should bo intrusted to the English board, with two Scotch membera, but if he had proposed SUCh a thing It wotuld naturally have occasioned much difficulty in Scotland and besides, on consultatios with the English board it wa found to be imnpossible to work the system on that prin. ciple, Then they were told that they should have con: nectedthe business with the Board of Soperversion; but when that was proposed in 1849 Sir J. M'Neiil himself stated that he would not undertake it *and had such a course been taken it would havo made little difference, for they must have had additional paid commnissioners, with a paid secretary. This, therefore, wazs A mere question of words, and not of substance. If the Board of Supervision could have undertaken the duty he should have been mnost glad to chargo them with it. The third proposition was that the lome Secretary, with the aid of inspectors, should do the duties of the board. if the machinery of the system were once set agoing, that perhaps might be sufficient; but at the beginning of a new state of things like this the Secretary of State would be utterly powerless. It appeared to hima that for the first fire years at least it would bo better to carry on the system with one or two paid members and paid inspectors than to put it under the management of the Home Secretary who would be compelled to take advice from the Lord Advocate or other unaackcnowledged authority in earrying out the provisions of the Act. One or two questions had beer ask-ed relative to the report of the coammision. A.11 lhe had to say was that a copy of the report had beensent to every sheriZin Scotland; and when answers were returned froxm those sheriffs theni they would he able to judge of bothsides,. With regard to the Orkney case, he hiad sent for the papers relatingto it, and had made everyinquirytingetatthe trutlx of the matter. lt turned out that te unfortunate woman had gone into the hospital in Edinburgh with herribsbroken that he had been unable to discover the slightest trace of any violence being exercised towards her by those who had charge of her from the time of her leaving Orkney to tho time of her arrival at Edinburgh. She was removed in a state of complete mania, and no doubt in that state she met with the severe injuries which had been described, bht whether by any undue roughness on the part of her attendants he had not been able to inform himself. The Bill could not be called hasty leoislation, for it was very much needed, and he hoped the House would consent to give it a Eec-ond reading. M1r. E. ELLTCE.-What is to be done with the pauper lunatics in the meantime? The LORD ADVOOATE.-Of course, until there were Elaces to send them to they could not be sent anywhere. The ton. gentleman had suggested that their allowances should be increased, but that could only be done by the Board of Supervision. He had sat frequently on this board, and he knew that three or four hours a-week were oceupied in considering applications for increased allowances. No part of the duty of the board was discharged more ably than this. There was an idea that the allowances generally were a great deal too low, but he should be very sorry to commit himself to that opinion. The habits and condition of t,he lower orders in Scotland were matters which must be taken into consideration, and it was vain in think of importing fromz the south ideas and opinions vwhich were entirely forelgn to Mr. A. BLACK said he had sat on the Board of Super vision as an ez o.icio memnber, and at no board with whpich he had ever been connected was the business better con. ducted. In regard to the question of allowances the habits of the people must be considered. What was given to the paupers in some of tho counties in England would (as we understood) be looked upon as perfect luxury by many of the labouring classes o' Scotland. If there was English diet in the Scotch workhouses he was afraid there wouald be a competition to get on the pauper roll. Siace the Board of Supervision had been appointed the poor assessment had been increased 50 per cent. Mr. COWAN denied the statement of the hon. member for West Surrey, that the former measure on this sabject had been defeated by a meeting of the Scotch members He hoped that the attempt of the learned lord to remedy a state of things which was disgracefal to Scotland would be successfnL The Bill was then read a second time. FRAUDULENT TRUSTEES BILL. The House wert intocommitteo on this Bill, commencing with clause 3. Clause 3 was agreed to. On clause 4 Mr. E. EGERTON moved, in line 5, after " properly," to insert "or being intrusted with any property of any description for the purpose of performing, or causing to be performed, any work or labour upon or in respect of the same."' After a short conversation, The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that he had not the least objection to this particular ofrence being described anu included in the Bill. His anxiety was lest the words em. ployed should include more thanthis offence. He suggested that the amendment should be postponed, and should be further considered in the report, when he thought it might be more happily and more ehicaciously framed. Mr. PAGET suggested that the words used should be such as to include thrown silk, and MIr. HASSARD was equally anxious that muslin given out to be sprigged, as was commonly done in Ireland, should not be excluded from this enactment. Mr. BAINES thought that the words in thi3 clause; coupled awith those in the interpretation clause defining *-property" to mean every description of personal property, would be amply sufficient to secure aU the objects which hon. members vwere anxious to obtain. If upon considera. tion it were found that this w;as not the case, words might be introduced upon the report w hich should put the matter Mr. EGERTON said that his own belief was that the words of the clause were quite sufficient, but iu moving the amendment he had yielded to a strong desire entertained by the manufacturers that this miatter should be made the subject of a special clause. At present he would withdraw his amendment, but if upon reflection and communication with those interested in manufactures he foundthat the clause as it stood was not sufficient he would avail himself of the offernmade by his hon. and learmed friend the Attorney General, and would reniind him of his promise to bring up on the report such words as would meet their wishes. Mr. HADFIELD was not at aU satisfied that the clause would, as it stood, include these cases. The amendment was then withdrawn, and the clause wvs agreed to. OD clause G, imposing a penalty for the keeping of fraudulent accounts, MIr. SPOONER asked for an explanation of the wording of the clause. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said It had unfortunately been found in the case of certain companies that directors took sums of money out of the bank, without authority, in the guise of loans. The Bill therefore provided that iff a director received money from the bank or company in any other way than in paymentt of a just debt or demand, and did not enter it in the books, he would be liable to punishment for fraud. Mr. SPOONER thought that if a director paid himself what was due to him from the company without entering the payment in the books, such a proceeding ought to be treated as a fraud. Otherwise the debt would still remain on the face of the books, and he might claim it again from tbe company. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that the irregularity supposed by the hon. gentleman, although, no doubt, very reprehensible, did not conme within the same category as those fraudulont appropriations of the property of other persons against which this Bill was directed. Mr. AYRTON observed that the fraud in the hypothetical case put by tho hon. mnember would snot be in omitting to enter the repayment, but in ta;ing the money a second time. The clause was then agreed to, as were also clauses Z and S. On clautse 9, prescribing the punishment for a misde. meanour under this Act, Mr. uHADFIELD remarked that seven years' penal servitude was a very heavy punishment to inflict upon a trustee. Prudent men, as the law now stood, objected strongly to ACt as trustees; and care ought to be taken in legislating on such asubject not to deter honourable men from accepting such an office. If a stringent Act like thidavwa adopted to punish fraudulenttrustees, a countervailiui mieasure ought on the other hand, to be passed to protect honest trustees from the risks and losses to which they were constantly exposed. He understood, indeed, .that a Bill had been in. troduced into the other13o'uso for the Latter ebject; but haue did anotthviF nk it was being presTed fio:wa with sufficienit vigour. The ATTORNEY.GENNERAL s6iethtt the question of an alteration in the law which pressed heavy upon trustoes in a civil senso had engaged the attention of a noble and learned lord in another place, and the BiU on the subject to which reference had been made would probably come down to that Houso in time to receive due consideration. With regard to tho clause immnediately under discussion he was desirous of making twvo or three amendments in it. Since the clause was framed Parliament had made a materLad alteration in tho terms of penal servitude. The shortest of those terms, at the time wlhen the Bill wasoriginally dravwn, v;as seven years. It had now been reduced to three years. He had deemed it expedient to introduce this specios of punishment into a measure of this kind, and yet he had felt that seven years would. probably be too severe a term for such a class of delinquents. In the French and American codes the punishbment was limited to two or three years' imprisonment. The cDMmittee would agre with him that it was desirablo to retain the punishment of penal servitude, and he proposed to altor the clause as follows :-" To be kept in penal ervitude for the term of three years, or to suffer such other punishment by fine or imprisonument for not snore than two years, with or without hard labour, as the Court shall award." The snoxiemum terai of penal servitude would thus be three years, but there would be somo minor offences which would be punishable by fine, some other offenoes vwhich would ba punihable by simple imprisonment not exceeding two years, and in the worst cases there might be the additlon of hard labour. Mr. G. HADFIELD thought the clause stml too sevore. and hopod the case of the trustees would have the oonsideration of the Government. Tho clause, as amended, was then agrecd to. On Ql*ma 10, enaoting that nothing in the jlPI Ahquld, the difficulty. The clause as it stood provided that no pro. secution should be inatituted except with the consent of a judge of one of the superior courts or of the AttorneyGeneral; but upon that connent being obtined a bill might be presented to a graudjury expart, and a truste might thereupon find himself unawares made the defendant in a criminal p;osecution. He suggested, in order to remedy this inconvenience, that before A proseution sEould' b sanctioned, the trustee should be summoned before a judgle, or before tbe Attorney-General as the caso might be, and beard in his defenoe. (Hear, hear.) He would go so far a3 to say that, if it shouldappear in fro. ceedinge before the jude of any court that a trustee had been guUty of fraud, it should be competent for the judge to order a prosecution, but rlot until the iresumed delinquent had had an opportunity of being-heard. The ATrORlOY.GENER43 thought that the ordering of a prosecution night be left to the discreton of a judge or the law officers of the crovn, for it was not to be supposed that they would order a prosecution without good grounds. If it were made imperative that a fraudulent trustee should, provious to prosecution being ordered, be summoned before a judge to be heard, the effect of such a proceeding would, in many cases, be to warn the delinquent to quit the kingdom with as great speed as possible. With regird i the clause in the Bill he was far from sying it was not open to objection, but he had roposed Itin deference to the prejudices or apprehensions of some.hon. gentlemen'who felt adifficulty about assenting to the measure without the insertion of such a provision. He, however, did not himself wec that an enactment.to punish men gaUlty of f;aud would operate to deter honest people from becoming frustees. The Bill proposed that the duty of investigating comniiDnts and sanctioning prosecutions should be committed to judicil or official functionaries; and he hoped and believed that an efficient safeguard would thusbe provided against the abuse of the law, while It could so readily be brought into operation that not more than a few hours would interipose between. an appcation and the issue of the necesa warrant. The firt two claiuses proposed by his hon. and learned friend (Mr. Cairns) provided that if in any civil' proceeding against a trustee it appeared to the court or Judge that there was reasonable and probable cause for a criminal prosecution, the court might make an order sanctioning such prosecution. Now, such cause could only appear to the judge after the evidence had been taken, after the defendant had been heard, and when it became the duty of the court to pronounce judgment. Judges would put a strict construction upon these clauses; they would approach the discharge of the duty imposed upon themwith great unwillingness; they would Act with extreme caution, and he might even say reluctance. A judge, putting a stict construction upon the clause, would say, "I cannot declare that it appears to me there is reasonable and probable cause for a criminal prose. cution until the case has been regularly heard, and until the defendant has had a full opportunity of ex lainig his conduct" The result would be that no criinlcni rosecition could be instituted until the delinquents had hadavoor tunity of leaving the country, and the judicial proceens would become a mere farce. With regard to the third claps proposed by his hon. and learned friend, the full ,extent of the frauds committed by a trustee might not be at d0ce2 discovered. It might be ascertained that he hxd fraudulently approprlated to his own use 501., or 10001., or 1501.; whie in fact he might have misappropriated as many thousands. The effect of the writ of NC ereMatregqno would simply 'be that the defaulting trustee woild be required to give bail for the amall amo42t of his discovered frauds mentioned in the writ, and would then be. enabled to fly from the country and avoid the consequenoes of his crime. He (the Attorney-General) maintained that the mode of proceedng proposed by the Bill was infinitely more efficacious than that which his hon. and learned friend wished to substitute, and he hoped it would be sanctioned by the committee. Sir F. KELLY concurred in the opinion of theAttorneyGeneral, that there was some danger that a person charged. or about to be charged, with mnisdemeanour under this Bill mighb effect his escape unless means were provided for apprehending him before he was enabled to leave the country. He (Sir F. Kelly) thought the diffliculty mzight be met by providing that if there was reasonable cause to suP pose that a trustee had absconded, or was about to abscona a warrant might be issued for his apprehension, in order that he might be called upon to show cause why a prosecu tion shonld not be instituted against him. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said he would give the subject his consideration in the interal before brin&ing up the report. Mr. ROLT said he had supposed it was part of the scheme of his hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General, when he was introducing a new cede of criminal =lw in respect to breaches of trust, to protect the innocent trustee as well as to puish the guilty one. (Hear, hear.) He (Mr. Rolt) contended that the relation in which a trustee stood to his cistuique trust was whollydifferent from thxt which obtained between man and man in any of the ordinary transactions of life. (Hear, hear.) All mercantile transactions between men, generaly spealdng, were simple, short in du. ration, and easy of solution cor ared with the relation subLfting between a trustee and hs cestiquc trust, spreadino, as the latter often did, over a whole life, and generatin' some caws feelings of- respect and in others of anim ty Then, again, in mercantila life men entered into trans;. tions for the sake of their own profit - but it was different in the other case, and there would be great diffic'ulty in finding petsons to take upon them the relation of trustees if, while the Legislature Provided a punishment for the guilty trustee, it did not protect the, innocent trustee from mAll clous prosecutions. The ATTORNEY-GmEd3RAT explauned that wtiac.he said was that he had not introduced this clause because ote deemed it necessary to 3lay the apprehensionr that persons would feel on becoming trustees, but because be thought it necessary to have persons better colpetent to sudge of the nature of the fraud than would tbe found in ordinary h r. adOLT resumedi-The explaation of the AtutorneyGeneral seemed to tpprove the view he oMr. ioltl took, thae iti was7 necessary to shield the innocent; trustee from mnlloious prosecutions, while provision was made for the punishament of the guilty one. At all events, he7 submitted that that was absolutely necessar, and that the amendment of his hon. and learned friend (ifr. Caiirns) was undoubtedly to 'oe preferred toethe clause as7it stood originally, inasmnuch as the amendment did not allow either a judge or tlUe Attorney-General, on the one hand to direct a prosecution against a trustee, without allowing t at trustee to be heard or on the other, to permit a guilty trustee to escapo from& the jurisdiction of the court. (Hear, hear.) The SOLICITOR-GENlE L said, after the statoment of his hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General, he could not understand the object of his hon. and learned fuiend the member for Belfast in persisting with his amendment, and the less so as there was so much ideQatity between it and the prop,osition of the Attorney-GenerlZ The cases in which parties ought to be heard were the exceptions. He granted that if the person to be proceeded sgainst were a man of status he might be summoned, but for one such case there were a thousand cases of dishonest trustees who wished to escape. He could not conceive that any object would be accomplished by the amendment which was not accomplished by the cause of the At. torney-General. Mr. HENLEY understood the obect of the clause to be to give some protection agains malUcious prosecu. tions, but he believed that unless the party were heard it would prejudice the defendant rather than pro. tect him. If these eases were so complicated that greater ability was necerary than the ability of a stipendiary mgstrate to decide whether the statue of trstee existed or not, he thought it quite possible that some deed might be suppressed, or a state of things represented which admitted of a-complete and immediate answer. Wpess charges of forgery and murner it could hardly be said that any ex parte pro. ceedings were taken, and the power of aing before a grand jury and preferring a bill of indictment behind a man's back wasviewed withconsiderable disfaveur,because of it liability to abuse. It was quite possible under this Bill that one case might be taken before the Attorney-General and another before the grand jury. There was nothing in the clause to insure the defendanthaving any knowledgeof what was alleged against him. He thought the requiring a suit to be firrt instituted unnecessary, as in many of the. worst cases the only object would ha pnishment. If the, Government gave an assurance that they would intoduce words to securo the party being hea=, he should prefer the, clause to the one proposed in substitution of it. If the de-. fendant were not heard he would go before the grand jury. with the weight of the Govornment clcial unfairly pressing, against him; but if he were head he would stand in the same position as a defendant before a magistrate, and might. exercise his own discretion Fwhethe ho would saf anything. or Lot in his defence. The A'l'TORNEY-GENERAL said, he would give, an assuranco that words should be added to the flause givIng the judge or Attorney-General-more particularly the juldg& -power to summon the party accused. He would not oarry It to the extent of making the summons compulsory. 1Be 'would have gladly dona s6.i the judge had had the powepto.. convict. That was his original intention, and he so.framed the clause, bat on consuiting the judges they expressed, suc. great repugnance to cxercisingthe power that he was.oblih to draw the clause in its present form. Mr. CAIRNS said, be was utesatisfd witthe asurance of the Attorney-GeneraI that the clause should be remodelled so that the judge or Attorney-Genart should have the power of giving the accused an opportunity of being heard. He would suggest whether it wold no make the m achtnerym more co mplete oa dh or fin n tho-se cases in which somethingmustbe doneimmedlatelyawarrant or a writ of sic exeat seguo. The amendment was then withdrawn, and the- clauso agreed to. The remaining lauses were also agrea to, and the Home resumed. COURT OF SESSION (SCOTLAND) BILL. The LORD ADVOCATE moved the second reading of thin Bill. Mr. BLACK stated several objections to the Bill, which, be said, would operate prejudicially to the interests of suitors. It had been condemned by the Society of Writers to the Signet and by the Society of Solicitors in the supreme courts. Its main object was to empower the Lord President to transfer cautes from the first to the second division of the Court of Session. The plea was- that the first division was overwhelmed with business.- He maintained, however, that by sitting three weeks or a month beyond its usual time the firstdivisioncouldeaslygetridof its arears. The suitors in the Court of Session had enjoyed the privilege of choosing the-judge by whom their causes should be tried for along series of vears, and it had been found exceedingly beneficial. He moved that the Bill be read a second time that day three months. MIr. BUCHANAN seconded the amendment. The LORD-ADVOCATE said the Bill was intended to remove a state of things which had been found to act preju- dicially in Scotland. It was intended to deprive one suItor of the privilege of selection which at present the pursuer enjoyed. The consequence of the pTesent practice had been that while one branch of the court was 'comnparativ,ly lightly worked, another, which might he a more popular branch, was over-worked, and therefore necessarily fell into arrears. He considered the right of selection was unfounded in principle, and that al judges should be equil to their duties, iu *hic. case tho public interests would be

LONDOA, PPYDAY, JULY 10, 1857. In the House of Lords last night The Sale of Obscene Publications Prevention Bill passed through committee on the motion of Lord Lord M mBuSnBy, on behalf of Lord DERiuY, gave notice that it was that noble lord's intention to I ove to-day that the Oaths Bill be read a secoad time this day six months. * Some other business was also despatched, after which their Lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons, at the morning sittiicn on the order for going into committee upon thb Re formatory SchoolN Bill, Mr. ALcoCK moved' to defer the committee for three months, his chief objection to the BiU being that it was compulsory, and would therefore interfere with voluntary efforts. The amendment was seconded by Mr. HmultB3uny, who argued that the measure waa not called for, and that it would impede rather than facilitate the reformatory movement. Sir G. (GREY said the speech-of Mr. ALcocKhad no reference to this Bill, which he could not hava reAd. The Bill of last session was comnpulsory, but that priucp!1e had been expressly excluded from thoe pro. In the debate which ensued tihe iit 6bjecLions urged ar,aint the measure were that it would oast a heai burden upon the ratepayero, and imiped ;voluntasy actionin the reformatory movement. The amendment was supported by Mr. Buiscoz, Mi,. BUXTON, Sir H. Vzmmm, Mr. GAnmTrr, Mr.. BARitow, and Mr. PBAsSE; whbile Sir E. EXruisox, Mr. HacuAiocir, M1r. MmNws, M1r. B. DENisoN, Mr. BAnS, and hIr. C. Gn nr spoke in favour of the BilL Upon a division the amendment was negatived by 168 to S7, and the Ilousewent into committeoupon the Bill, the detaisof whieh occupied the remainder of the sitting. -In the evening, M&r. SCHOLEFMLD, chairman of the Mayo Election Committee, brought up a special report, stating that letters addressed to Colonel HEuGGss had been i1id before the committee containing the information that certain persons namred therein, in consequence of their having given evidence before the committee had been attacked and one of them seriously injurea by a mob. MIr. WAPOLE called attention to this report, and suggested that it was right for the House to condder whether the matter should be left where it was without some inquiry. Mr. J. D. FITZGERAD said, in consequence of the production of these letters before the committee, it had been ascertained by a telegraphic commurnica tion that an outrage had been committed; that two persons had been beaten severely, anid that nine persons, charged as participators in the outrage, wecre in custody. He hoped to be in Dublin this day, and anticipated no difficulty in placing these parties on their trial at the approaching assizes. Iin the meantime any interference on the part of the Elouse might be productive of great inconvenience. Onthe order forthe second reading of the Lunatics (Scotland) Bill, after afew remarks by Mr. BAXTir, Mr. a. BnumE recomnmended the postponement of the measure, to the machineryof which he objected, on the ground that there was not time during the present session for the consideration of its details. Mr. D1xuMOXD thought that any machinery was better than letting things go on as they were. Mlr. HOPE JoansToNz suggested certain altera. tions in the Bill. - Colonel SvxEs defended the Board of Supervi. sion. I Mr. WBE=rnAD and Mr. F. DuNDAs made a few observations. Mr. E. ELrsr supported the BiU. He threw out suggestions as to the fit machinery for such a measure, but intended, he said, to leave the whole responsibility with respect to the details of the Bil to-.the Government, considering that it would at leaat inaugurate a new system. Mr. BcxnunN agreed that something should be doze; that asylums should be built, buthe saw no necessity for a Board. After a short explanation from Sir G. GnBy, and some remarks by Air. W. EWART and Mr. Duiop, The LonD. ADVOCATE replied to objections, stating 'what were the evils to be remedied, and discussing the various suggestions offered as remedies. Mr. BLACK, who had been an eM officio member of the Board of Supervision, said he had never seen the business of any Board so well conducted as by the held of that Board. Mr. CowAN defended the Scotch members against certain remarks made by Mr. DRSumOND. The Bill was read a second time. The House then went again into commlittee upon the Fraudulent Trustees, &c., Bill. The 9th clause, assigning the punishment for a misdemeanour under the Act, was materially modified; The 1lth clause, providing that no remedy at law or in equity shall be affected, was amended by the imertion of the words, uggested by Mr. CATsRs, "NlSothing in this Act contained shall affect or pre4 .judice any agreement entered into or security given by any trustree, having for its object the restoratpon or repayment of any trust property misappro- The 12th clause, which enacts that no prosecution shall be commenced without the sanction of a judge in equity or the Attorney-General, was much discussed, and Mr. OAIws moved to amend it by enacting that- " E in any civil proceeding against a trustee, r In any proceeding under the bankruptcy of any person beinga trustee, it shall appear to the Court or Jndge before whom such proceeding shall be pending that there is reasonable and probable cause for a criminal prosecttion against such trustee under this Act, it shat be lawful for such Court or Judge to make an order sanctioning such prosecution, which order may be obtainedupon motion or petition in asummary way." This amendment was withdrawn upon an assurance given by the ATronwEv-G=RrneA that upon biingingup the report he would introduce words to give the Judge or Attorney-General power to summon the party, in order that he might have an opportunity of being heard. In the interpretation clause, on the rotion of Mr. E. Eosnsoy the word " property" was made to include " goods, raw and other materials." On the order for the second reading of the Court of Session (Scotland) Bill, Mr. Br,&cu opposed the Bill, and moved to defer the second reading for three months. I The LoRD ADvOCATE defended the Bill, which took away a right of choice founded, he thought, upon a false principle. Mr. Cr.AuFrul and Mr. BLACKBUN spoke in opposition to the Bill, aud Mr. DUNxor in its favour. The amendment was negatived, and the Bill was read a second time. The Crowrn, &., Suits (Scotland) Bill, the Bankruptcy and Real Securities (Scotland)i Bill, the Bill Chamber (Scotlad) Bill, and the Municipal Corporations Bill passed through committeeb !The Banking Bill, the Boundaries of Land (Ireland) Bill, the filitia Ballots Suspension BilL and the Metropolitan Police Stations, &c., BilB were read a second time.. Other Bills were advanced a stage, and, aftersome further businss, the House adjourned at 1 o'clock.
If romance and mystery can insure remembrance, the terrible ease which was yesterday concluded at Edinburgh will have an abiding plaec in the annals of criminal] justice. AInDrLPi2N SR&r has, after nine days! trial, been acquitted; and goes forth again free into the world. On the first charge of attempt o poison she' has been found "Not " Guilty,' while the second charge to the same effect aiA the actual murder have been declared " (tot Proven." The death of PiERRn EnmTE L'AxoG:ai is pronounced by the jury to be a mystery, which the evidenwe brought before them was unable to solve. Thus ends the case I Human juBice aclknowledges itself baffled, and ceases itB attempt to unveil 'what perhaps is for ever destined to be hidden. The last few; years have certainly been a period full of startling crimes. The old times of want and discontent in these islands were, no doubt, prolific of lniuch murdering and riot, arson, and forgery ;' but the offences of our own day seem to have.no connexion with any public disorder. They are isolated tragedies, in which' the hunger after gain or the thirst of blood has alone proiipted 'the murderer. There was nothing in' the example of the world about them which should urge RUSH to his vengeance anct the MAIi3IXGs to their treacherous design; which should tempt PALin: and his a miserable jnitator DovE to destroy those most closely connected with them by blood and friend-' ship. Similarly unaccountable have been the crimes committed of late by women. Wbile it is admitted on all hands that never at any former period were domestic manners so unexceptionable, we are shocked with the continual recurrence of attempts by - women against the liveis of. husbands, paramours, and children. Poisoning especially has become almost a domestic institution. The friendlly arsenic has always been ready in the cottage of the peasant or in the lodging of the mecb.aiac, to rid the impatient. wik of. a tieso>16 husband, or the thrifty iousewite Of parents, or relations, who have become a burden. So, when it was announced that 'r-kt- higher rank of lifea simiLar crume had ben *oh ' mitted, there was interest and excitement but withoiit surprise. Scotland ias' been fort n ly four months occupied ir Miss MADWjRWa S3TmB and her lover, and, though there".ist7 3ilL sufflicien distinction between' the'two' countries to' give a Scotch case some diffici4t in achieiing, an English reputation, 'gyet''since the commencement of the actual trialthe I interest of. the South has not been less than that whicfi prevailed beyond the Tweed. And well it might be so, for never were the chance of con-. demnation and escape so evenly balanced. A Scottish jury decides' by a majority, and the: majority has declared that the evidence in not sufficient to prove the prisoner guilty. But to the.', last there were many who believed that the-' opinion held by the minority would prevail, and that the unhappy girl would suffer the penalt of the crime alleged against her. The dead man IAN-GaLIER is not ono whose fate there is any need to commiserate. His conduct to - one who had been his victim was base and u--D manly in the.last degree, and can only be excused.: on the ground stated by the LORD ADVOCATE, that by the law of Scotlind an irregular mar-h riage might be held to have taken'place, and that A 'A-4E=R had a right to consider mAzDwqs snr as his wife and to prohibit her union with another man. It appears that the prisoner left her Clapton boarding-school in 1853, when she was only 1' years old, and that within two years -of that time she met the deceased, said to be a native of Jersey, and at that time in the employment of a Glasgow warehouseman, at a salary of 8s. or 10s. a-week with his board and lodging. L'A-GELim paid his addresses, which were well received by the young lady but forbidden by her parents, who doubtless thought his position and prospects not such as would entitle him to ask-their daughter's hand. M,onths passed, however, and the intimacy of the pair continued. X&nELE . slept on the ground floor, and used to receive the visits of her lover first at the window, and then in the room itself. In the spring of 1856 welfind from her letters that she had been seduced by L'ANoGEIE, and from that time to the close of the year she writes to him almost daily in the vRild style with which the readers of the trial are familiar. By the beginning of the present year, however, her passion had cooled. A Mlr. Mrm-ocH had proposed in all innocence to her, and in spite of stolen interviews and boarding-school heroics she thought it better to have a solid Glasgow manu of business than a French clerk on 301. a-year, who boasted to everybody of his successes with women in general, and herself in particular. But L'AnGEIGEL had no notion of giving her up. He did not, it appears, insist on lier marrying him, but he would not allow her to marry any one else. It wag in vain that ahe wrote to him that their love had mutually grown cold and.that they had better forget each other. Exam would show her letters to her father and to 'Mr. MNocHi if the match were not at once brokeuoff. This was the motive for the crime alleged by the prosecution. -Under the threats of the Frenchman, EtE is obligea to6 write back that the affair with Mfr. Mt * NocH is a false report. She seems desirous to- 3 I get L'A sELim away, so that her marriagemight take place before he could prevent it. LA7oGELm, however, remains, and persists in his threats. On the 9th of February she is distracted with terror. She implores hiin not to bring her tG open shamie, and solemnly declares that she has no other engagement-having, however, promiised her hand to MIr. -fNqocH on the 28th, of the previous month. Dates now become: of importance. The prisoner for some reason or other feigns a renewal of her attachment for LAIoGsusn She wishes to bring him back to - her; the prosecution say that she may poison him-she says that she might coax him to give back the letters. On February 17 he dines with Miss PERRY. He tells her that he is to see Miss S)raTH on the 19th. We kn6w not if he did see her on thatday, but we knowfrom the testimony of his landlady that on that night he was seized with sudden illness-as mnen are ill from arsenic. that the prisoner administered poison on this 19th of February is the first charge of which she wasfound Not Guilty. Every Glasgow chymisfs books were searched, and no purchase of arsenic was proved prior to the 19th, so that with respect to this first day there was sufficient doubt to justify a verdict of fuU acquittal. But on the 21st MAtDBI;£1NE purchases arsenic at the shop of M1r. MiunDoc. She signs her name as required by Act of Parliament, and not only gives her real address, but has the dose, value sixpence only, put down to herfather's account. MIiss Ssrri explains the purchase by stating that she used arsenic as a cosmetic, by dissolving it in the wat(r with which she washed,-a process respectirg Which scientific opinions are divided. However, L'ANGELIER iS ill again on the night of the 22d, but recovers a second time. Time passes on, and . we must conclude there are more negotiations for the surrender of the letters, for Miss S.%isr stil keeps on her engagement with 3r. MN-O4Eg - On March 6 she again buys arsenic-to poison rats or improve her complexion, according to her various accounts-and this time it is in company with Miss BUCHA;NAN, a young lady from the Clapton school. L'AonGErsR goes to Bridge of Allan to recruit his health, and not to the Isle of NVight, 500 miles off, as his mistress advises ' bim. There he wvrites her a letter, sayin.g he believes that she is going to m,arry Mr. 3MIN-NocH, and demands direct answers to several questions on the subject. He is proved to be anxious for a letter in answer to this last miSsive; when he receives it he returns in perfect health. He comes home in the highest spirits, and says the letter has brought him back. On the 22d of M)arch he goes out a little before 9 o'clock. [le is seen sauntering along in the neighbourhood of Blythswood-square about 20 minutes past 9. About half-past 9 he makes- a caU on a friend, Who is not at home. Then we lose sight of him for two or three hours. He had gone out to see the prisoner, having come back all the way from , Bridge of Allan for the interview; he had reached the neighbourhood of the prisoner's iesiden'ce-the question is,-Did thoy meet? The prisoner says no; that the interview -was' for, Saturday not Sunday. The prosecution assertsi That they did. At all events L'AoGimR is found four'hours3afterlwards in agonies at his ovm door. He is doubled up, speeechless, and has. not strength to turn the latchkey. He dies andi dies of arsenic. The prosecution aver that he is poisoned by the prisoner; she declares her inno- - cence, and suggests that he must have done it himself in a fit of jealousy. Evidence is' adduced that 'he was vain, foolish, and extravagant, always talkting of love affairs, and threatening suicide when he ws disappointed. This is all the light that cau bh thrown on the terrible 9ceurrence. That the jury' shouild deelar T thfe crinhe'ot Proven is hardly surprising; for the circumstances are as mysterious as any that bave ever been related in a. court of justice... If 'on the one hand the prisoner, pur. chases arsenic, and thinlis of her complexio ou for the'firbt time when she is distractea w ith terrr respecting her good name, on the other hand she
The resolutions of the Oxford Election Committee pifer the first direct proof of the efficacy of the Corrupt Practices Act. In ahnost every other tnstance the operation of the statute has been tavourable to the sitting members. Mlr. NEATE's Bents would, indeed, at any time have endangered is seat by the gross error of retaining 152 voters their pay under the name of messengers; but she returns which the agent for expenses is required -to furnish to the election auditor for the first time ,rovide conclusive evidence of a transactidn which It would otherwise have been difficult to expose. 'the proof that 10 or 20 voters had been engaged in the service of the sitting member would not have ted to the conclusion that the epuployment was 4nerely colourable. The excessive number of ;nessengers, which formed the essence of the pharge, was necessarily admitted on the face of the tublished accounts. The fifth resolution of the Committee declares t' that treating to some extent was carried on t' at thc last election for the city, but it was not proved to be carried on by the 44order or authority of the said CHAR:LES f' ]N&ETE, Esq." In other words, there was no ;ufficient proof of agency to connect the illegal cts with the sitting member. The Oxford Comnttee seem, nevertheless, to have repudiated the Wareham decision, that guilty k,nowledge must *te shown before the candidate is made liable for the proceedings of his agents. It is ex- "ressly reported " that it appeared to the it Cormmittee that the aforesaid acts of bribery C; were committed without the knowledge or 't consent of the said CHARLES NEATE, Esq." ;But, notwithstanding this acquittal, Mr. OVATE is disqualified, under the 3Gth section *Df the Act, from represeliting Oxford in the -xisting Parliament. It vas not necessary For the avoidance of the election to report that the -sitting member had by his agents been guilty of Jribery. If Mr. CAeDwrELL had petitioned for the seat the poll would have been amended by strikr*ng off the votes of the 152 messengers; and in the inquiry which actually took place the -Committee was at liberty to declare that the return was bad, inasmuch as the majority lad been obtained by unlawful means. It -remains to be seen' hereafter whether, in ParIiamentary construction of law, a person can be .guilty of an indictable misdemeanour without his own knowledge or consent. The decisions are up to this time inconsistent and contradictory. It is not, however, so desirable that the reports of Election Committees should be technicaUy consistent as that they should be approved by common Eense as substantially reasonable and just; and it is evident that the narrow majority by which Mr. NEATE was rcturnedmayhavcbeensecured by undue -maeans. A candidate has no ground of complaint if he is held responsible for acts which have practically caused his success. MIr. NnEAT only de-feated his rival by 41 votes, and if 50 out of the 150 paid voters were influenced by the employment -whicli they received Mr. CARDWELL ought to have been the member for Oxford. At INIaidstone one of the sitting members polled -a clear majority of the whole constituency, and lieaded his opponents by more than a hundred votes. Utnless there is some strange peculiarity in the character of the borough, the allegation that ten or a dozen voters had been bribed is perfectly -consistent with the genuineness of the actual return. The defeated party, if their charges were in their opinion -well founded, had a perfect right to revenge their disappointment; but they can scarcely have hoped to retrieve theirreverse -at a subsequent election. It seems that much local interest was felt in the contest before the Com:.mittee, but no general principle is establislhed or affected by the report. The charge of undue influence was abandoned by the petitioners, and the rattempt to prove treatinig altogether broke down. Several distinct cases of bribery by promises were proved as far as oaths could prove themn; but the proof of connexion between the sitting members and the alleged instruments of corruption was of a vague and incon-elusive character. The defence was, however, not -confined to the usual arguments on the law of -agency. Every specific instance of bribery was *eontradicted by those who were supposed to have .administercd the bribe; and it may be presumed that -the Committee leaned in favour of the innocence of the accused, notwithstanding the declaration in the {report that the evidence was very unsatisfactory and contradictory. Where direct perjury must have been .!ommnitted on the one side or on the other, evidence is seldon found to be either consistent or satisfacltory; but courts of justice would admit a pre-sumption against voters who profess that they .have sold their votes, on the grouatd that they ,nay not improbably be willing to sell their testi.nony. TheMaidstoneCommittee adds theinteresting his-torical fact comrnunicated by Mr. BERESFORD HOPE -that " it appeared that a siun of 3,5001. was paid in " the year 1847 for the expenses of the election of i one candidate, although there was no contest on .i that occasion." 7,0001. for the enjoyment of a -borough during the continuance of a single Par- ialment certainly seems a considerable sum; but ten years have passed since 1847; public feeling bas chavged, and even the ill-drawn Act for the Prevention of Corrupt Practices has rendered ex-eme abuseg impossible, and given rise to a whole-some feeling of alarm. The same witness who ivoluntcered the confession of obsolete irregularities established the fact that neither the sitting members nor their leading supporters had consented to the smallest illegal expenditure in 1857. As ,stones are set up to mark the summit level of .extraordinary floods, the resolution of the Commnittee will record for the instruction of future generations of electors in MIaidstone the incredible point to which illicit liberality had reached before it subsided for ever. The stringency of a law which seduces thousands of expenditure to hundreds must, k\% vwoald seem, be not unwelcome to candidates, as vrell as to those who value purity of election. The fflaidatone report adds nothiDg to the col- ection of decisions on agency, as it does not appear whether the alleged acts of bribery were thought to have been sufficiently disprovwd. Th) resolutions in the case of Bury to a certain extent support the doctrine which found favouw in W` case of Wareham. The return of the sittiing l member was held good, notwithstanding the coma mission of illegal acts on the part of zealog. partisans. In some instances {e p6esons charged had both canvassed for their candidate and engaged rooms for the purposes of the election. The decision that the agency wa5 insufficiently proved woiuld have been less remarkable if the Committee had not added as a reason for their judgment that the treating had not taken place with the knowledge of MIr. Pnmu. According to the old interpretation,it wassufficient to prove that the instrument of corruption, was an& agent of the candidate for the purposes of the election. If the new doctrine is established sitting members will seldom be unseated, exrept in thee'ase of a close contest, followed up by a scrutiny. AEr. NEATE may reasonably think that he has been unfortunate in his tribunal, although, as it has been shown, the election might have Ibeen avoided without any personal judgment against the sitting member. Ptactically it is well that petitions should not be encouraged as- long as elections are com paratiMely pare. The amount of illegal expensi ture in 1857 must have been unprecedentedly small, nor is it likely that in half a dozen cases the majority has been obtained either by treating or by bribery. In 1847 petitioners almost always succeeded. In 1857 they almost always fail. The separate cases of alleged corruption are probably weaker, but it is certain they are regarded with comparative leniency, because they are no longer characteristic of a widespread evil.
That the Parliamentary Oaths BIll may pass into law and thus relieve the Legislature, the chiefs of all political parties, and the public at large from a controversy in which every element but that of resolution has been long exhausted, is what we should think most readers by this time must sincerely desire. Argument has been worn threadbare on the subject, but with this result, at any rate,-that the party which advocates the admission of Jews to Parliament has increased in numbers and strength up to this day. Its last demonstration has been the most forcible of aU, nor did a Bill for the emancipation' of this class of HER MIJESTY'S subjects ever go up from the Commons to the Lords so powerfully supported as that wlhich -will be presented for a second reading this evening. What, indeed, is the position of the question, fairly and practically considered? Let us first suppose the measure to be rejected once more-what would be the results? No person can imagine that those who have been promoting the policy of Jewish Emancipation for the last 10 years, and who have every year found themselves stronger and stronger, will desist from their efforts at a moment when one of their most influential opponents has candidly avowed his adhesion to their cause. Of course, the agitation would be renewed and the struggle continued with as muclh vigour and deter-mination as - ever. The Liberal party are naturaly committed to the policy of relief, but it happens that some of the most eminent among their opponents are committed too. The Conservatives could never successfulUy oppose the measilre when it was reintroduced, defeat upon it would be inevitable, and it would be a thorn in the side of any Government they could form. All the inconvenience attending a controversy like this would survive, with the extraordinary addition of a political dilemma. The Conservatives must either connive at a proposition which they had made a. point of resisting, or be beaten in opposing it, and find their own chiefs in the ranks of their enemies. Suppose, on the other hand, that the measure should become law, where would be the evils apprehended? They are summed up in the prediction that the Leg,islature would be " unchristianized." Our Legislature, it is alleged, is essentially Christian. Why? As representing an essentially Christian nation. But, if the admission of a Jew to an equality of civil rights with a Christian is in any way destructive of national Christianity, that result was accomplished so far when one of the most important constituencies in the kingdom decided upon the act. The Christianity of the nation, be it remembered, remains still, and ever must remain, in its own hands. Jews can only go to Parliament when Christians bavo sent them there. The Oaths Bill will not invest a Jew with the smallest inherent privilege ; it will simply give freedom of choice to Christian constituencies. We say this much for the theory-what would be the result in practice ? Probably a result invisible to anybody except in the disappearance of a troublesome dispute. The Jews are very few in number; they are not aggressive, not given to makting proselytes or forming parties; and if the votes of Christian electors should faU upon members of this persuasion in one or two instances the consequences would be traceable, perhaps, in one or two sensible speeches on particular subjects. Beyond this, nobody would be likely to discern any difference, and the wonder would be how the contest could ever have been maintained. One word more-it shall be a decisive one-Lto those whose minds are alarmed on behalf of the national Christianity. If the nation can be unchristianized by the emancipation of the Jews it must clearly have been 'unprotestantized by the emancipation of the Papists. Was this the case? Let the national movement at the time of the Papal Aggression supply the answer. What good can be done by keeping this question open? As far as protests are concerned, they have been made; as far as dissent goes, it has been' recorded. No kind of opposition has sufficed to suppress the movement on the other side, or even to prevent it from gaining strength. Christian constituencies have persisted in electing Jews, and the House of Commons has persisted in affirming that Jews ought to be eligible. The majority for emancipation gets larger and larger. The question, it is plain, must either be dropped, or be carried, or remain as it is. The first of these events is not to be anticipated-can there be a doubt which of the two latter is preferable T We cannot think so; on the 'contrary, it seems to us that the settlement of the question would be as great a relief to Parliament as to the Jews themselves.

THsn MAILS, &c.-SOuTHAroN, Thursday.-The Royal Mail Company's steamship Tamar, Captain-Jellicoe, sailed to-day with the Brazilian and River Plate mails, 62 passengers, specie value 33,200g., jewelry value 32,000.i and a full cargo. The European and American Company's steamship Argo, Captaiu Benson, which left New Yorkl on the 21th nlt., arrived here early this morning, bringing 150 passengers and a general cargo for Southampton anu Bremen. She sails for Bremen at daylight. On her passage zhe passed the American ship Exchange, in lat. 43 46 ., long. 42 14 W., steering to the southward; the American sbip Potomac, in lat. 46 20 N., long 3610 W., steering to the-eastxWard ;-'nd tUe-bark Janet Hendervon,1in lat. 4n2 N., long. 3133W., Steering.to the westward.

SINGULLABR ErFECTs oF ELE=timry.-A singul2r occurrence took place a abort time since at the locomo'ive 'works, illustrating libg powerful effects of electricity. A lecomotivo was beink nmovesd from the manufactory to the central depot, and had arrived in the middle of the street, when sgddenly all hands dropped the bars with which they were niovi;,g the machine, and fell back in amazement. ResumiDg them at the order of the man in charge, they appligd them again to the wheels, and again fell back paralyzed the instant tbey touched the iron: 'The director of the job caTivht up one of 'the bars, and making a savwh throat0 planted it under a wheel preparatory to giving a huge lift. No sooner bad it touched, however, than he saw it fall from hiz grasp to the gronund, aS it had done in every case before. Sucn sinsular occurrences excited attention, and an examnination was made as to the cause, when it was found that the locomotive, in passing under the telegraph line, had come in contact with a broken wire that hung sufficiently low to reach it. The wholemassofiron composing thelocomotive had thus becomne charged with electricity, 'hich had communicated itself to the bars that the men held in their bands, and caused the effect above described. The wire was then removed, and the difficulty obviated in a moment.- Detroil Pree PIcss. SWVJNDLrNNG ON A GR.AND SaAm w PABIS.-The Tribunal of Correctional Police on Siturday tried by defaulta married womnan named DUboYS and her son, a young man 30 aears of age, fors*indling. The circumstances were curious :-The woman, it appears, is the wife of a superior cmp?oy,- of the ponts-et-chauss6es, ahighly respectable man, and for some years she lived happily with him. L Daboys, having received an appointment in Martinique, went to that island, leaving his .'wife and son at Paris. On his return, after the lapse of a few years, he learned that the woman, for whona he ontertained a profound affection, had assurned the title of Countess de la Vigerie, to which she .had no right whatsoever though La Vigerie was her maiden ijame; that she had run into debt, obtained donations from the claritable on pretext of bringing up a foundling,, an Indian, whom she had adopted, and had commnitted other reprebensible acts, besides bringing up her sor in a way that no good mother would have done. Profoundly aflicted, M1. Daboys deemed it prudent to separate from her, and he obtained a few years back an appointment in Algeria. After his depeiture the mother and her soon took to swindling as their regular means of livelihood. They established hat they called a " Society of Progress and General "elare," the object.s of 'which were rather various -1. To moralize youth by gratuitous lessons in drawing, m-nusic, an4 sulpture; 2. to establish religious singing associations;. 3. to relieve the widows and daughters of functionariesin distress; 4. to supply pure milk to the Parisian population by means of an oflice calledthe "Laiterie Imp riale," with a capital of 60Q,000f.; And 5. to get up a lottery of 400,ootf. to relieve the distress caused by high rents. This society, they pretended, was not only under the special patronage of the Emperor and the Empress, but had been fortned by their Majesties, and was started by funds geuerously contributed by them. The subscription to it was 24f. a-year. The prisoners to lk a i,pln,ndidlv furnisbed apartment in the Rue St. Honorc for its offices, and while the male prisoner attached to hivself 'a private secretary, an aide-de-camp (such was the title given), and a number of inferior cmplor6s, his mother, who called herself directress of the society, surrounded herself with a number of females,to whom she uromised different places. The mother and son talked in the most magnificent way of their intimacy with the Emperor and Empress, showed presents which they said* their gajesties bbid made thein, and often went tothe Tuileries to, as they alleged, sce their Alajesties. Not content with the E n- peror:.z friendahip, the yisie man besides gave himself out as-a grand officer of- the Legion of Honour and a; a Knight,of the Garter. Notwithstandingall thiz,snbscriptions to the soc,ietj caine in but slowly, but foolish tradesmen eagerlyegave ciedi, ar amon- them werewere a horsedealer, a dressmnaker ; confectioner, &d The private secretary and other ems,14 js were alsoi cersnaded to make advances of money aid so sign bills of exchange.

SECOND EDITION. TE BTIAMES&OFFICE, Fridcay Morning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris corrospondent, dated yesterday (Thursday), 6 p.m.:- The official announcement of the successful candidates of the 3d, 4th, and 7th electoral districts of Paris took place this morning at the Hotel de Ville in presence of the Departmontal Commission of the Seine. The proceedings were held in the Salle St. Joan, which was crowded with spectators, and opened at 10 o'clock. The mayors of the three arrondissoments just mentioned were in attendance to witness the verification of the votes. On his name being called, M. Decaen, the mayor of the 3d rirondissement, made known tLe result of the election in the 3d district. Ia this district the nutmber of registered electors amoanted to 34,842; the number of those who voted, 21,142; the number of suffrages counted, 20,96§); the number not colunted, 176. Of this number General Cavaignac (Opposition) obtained 10,950 votes, and M. GermainThibaut (Government) 9,952-lost votes 62. M. Prince de Lacomble, Mayor of the 4th arrondissement, announced that in the 4th district the registered electors were 35,347, the voters 21,3199; votes given 21,185-lost 131. M. Emile Ollivier (Opposition) had 11,005 votes, M. Varin (Government) 10,006-lost 77. M. Leroy de St. Arnaud (brother of the late :Marshal), mayor of the 12th arrondissement, announced the result in the 7th district, from which it appeared that the registered electors were 36,216, the voters23,523,lthe suffrages given 23,361, various bulletins 206. Of this nimber M. Darimon (Opposition) had 12,078, and M. Lanquetin (Government) 11,038, lost256. The Commission then retired to check the total of each district, and the returns given in by the presidents of the various sections. On re-appearing, the President of the Commission announced that the operations were perfectlyregular, and that the number of the registered electors tallied with the returns delivered by the Prefect of the Seine to the Departmental Commission. The President then formally proclaimed General Eugene Cavaignac a deputy to tho Legislative Corps for the 3d district of Paris, M. Emile Ollivier for the 4tb, and M. Alfred Darimon for the 7th. The proceedings terminated at half-past 10 o'clock. The voting tickets described as lost were those rejected on both sides from irregularity. These official returns vary very little, if at all, from the numbers alreadly communicated, but as they bear an official character, and will probably be published in the Moniteur tomorrow, I think it right to communicate them. MM. Severin, Abbatucci, and Mariani, the Government candidates, have been elected Deputies in Corsica, almost by unanimity. It is said that lIl. Delamarre, proprietor of the Patrie, who has jllst lost his election in the Somme, where he stood as the Government candidate, is to bo compensated by being raised to the rank of Senator. This is rather a dangerous precedent, as several Governmnent candidates might be tempted from such an advantage to put in peril their own election. The difference of salary in favour of a Senator is more than 20,000f. If M. Delamarre be named Senator he will have gained by his loss. The Empress left Paris at half-past 8 o'clock this morning to join the Emperor at Plombieres. M. Fould, Minister of State, Count Walewski, Minister of Foreigu Affairs, and M. B3illault, Minister of the Interior, were ini waiting on Her Majesty at the Strasburg Railway Terminus. The waiting-room was elegantly decorated, and flowers were collected there in profusion. The Empress was received on her arrival by the Mlinisters and by Count de Segur, chairman of the railway company, Baroni d'Hervey, Emile Pereire, Roux, Baigneres, Perdonnet, and Dolfus, directors. Baron d'Hervey an-I M. Baigneres took seats in the Imperial carriage, and accompanied the Empress as far as Epinal. M. Lieussion, the naval engineer charged with making the hydrographic plans at the mouth of the Adoiur, has addressed his report to the Minister of Marine, who immediately communicated it to the Mlinister of Commerce. It is believed, consequently, that the works for the improvement of the port of Bayonne wiiU be shortly commenced. A storm burst, thc day before yesterday, over Montdidier (Somme) and its neighbourhood. The damage caused to the windows by the hail was so great that, on a proprietor going to his glazier to have the necessary repairs effected, his name -was incribed as the 34th customer to be attended to. The hospital alone had 1,000 panes of glass broken. Considerable injury was done to the crops in the neighbourhood. After the storm several hares, rabbits, partridges, and hundreds of small birds were found dead in the fields, and two sheep were also inj uired. The same day a storm of thunder, lightning, rain, and wind broke over Valenciennes, and it did great damage in the kitchen gardens of the stuburbs, and it is feared injured the crops in tho fields. The storm extenlded to Anzin, and the lightning struck a cart which was about to enter a gateway of a farm-house, and killed both a man who was in tho cart and the horse lhe was driving. Two little boys wvho had accompanied the mnan, but who had jumped from the vehicle to open the gate, escaped unhurt. The lightning which killed the man had, it subsequently ap peared, first descended a chimney of the house, and had cut a hole through a wall ; after which it had darted along the entrance to the gate. It almost stripped the maan of his clothes, and cut each of his shoes in two, yet his dead body bore no mark of violence. The Eseho Agricois publishes the following informnation respecting the prospects of the vintage "The season has been hitherto very favourable to the vineyards, and this year's wine will probably be much superior in quantity to that of the last four or five. The oidium has appeared but in few places, and its ravages have been restricted by the use of sulphur. Some surprise is manifested that the price of wine should not have falen to some extent, but attention is not paid to the fact that many months must elapse before the new wine howevcr abundant it may be, can come into the market' No sensible decline in prices can be hoped for until the cellar's of the trade are full, and this is far from being the case at present. Nevertheless, a decline is certain, though goad wine wil always maintain its price. In the South the formation of the fruit haspassed over with complete success The harm said to have been inflicted by the recent rains has been greatly exaggerated. Letters from Bayonne stat3 that the vintage will be small in that neighbourhood in consequence of the limited number of bunches on the vines. At Bordeaux everything pronounces a splendid vintage. At Nantes the rain has done harm, and the preprietors ar3 somewhat alarmed for their vintage." The official U'azette of the Two Sicilies publishes the following details relative to the capture of the Cagliari - "About 4 o'clock In the afternoon of the 27th June a scrow steamer, carrying the Sardinian flag at her poop and a small red flag at her prow, anchored in the port of Tonza, unider pretence of being damaged. The captain of the port went on board to visit the ship, and was forcibly detained as prisoner. At the same time armed men landed from the steamer, and surprised the Custom-house gutard. which they disarmed. Other insurgents, well armed, as I carrying a red flag, attacked the guard-house of the veto. rans, with cries of ' Viva 7a &publica,' 'I V 'Itvftdia,' and tarried It after an exchange of a few shots." Despatches were received to-day from General '-e Goyon, who commands the French troops at Rome. They announce that tranquillty prevailsin that city, and the General states that he feels certain of maintaining it. It is remarked that the arms of the Italian con- spirators arrested in Paris are of the same manu facture as those seized at Genoa, Leghorn, and in Naples. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received " MARSEILLES, JULY 8. ! "Intelligence has been received from Constantinople to the lst. A rumour of the assassination of the King of Naples was contradicted by the .Presse d'Orient. Prince Ghika had forbidden the electors to give imperative direc. i tions to their representatives..

The fetes of the Circumcision commenced the day before yesterday, and they form, for the moment, the great centre of attraction for the capital. Like all other things here, they have lost in a great messure their Oriental character, and have become a kind of mongrel exhibition-something between an out-door le6ec of an eastern Sovereign and a feeble attempt at a Greenwich rfair, mintlts the green slopes; yet, in spite of this, the feltes are by no means devoid of interest, for, under all this half-European disguise, the spirit which animates the whole is thoroughly Eastern. Imagine an arid plateau, with only here and there the traces of stnnted weeds rising up from the Bosphorus, with the Golden Horn, the Seraglio Point, Scutari, the Sea of Marmora, full of white sails, at its feet, andi with the graceful outlines of Olympus in the distance. Add to this every amount of dazzling sunlight, heat, and dust you can realize, and you have thegeneral outline of the pictuire. This yellowish plateau has been transformed for the distance of a mile and a half into a city of tents, offering all the varieties of tent architecture-from the primitive tent shed, apiece of sackcloth, or a ragged piece of carpet on a fantasticaUy crooked stick to the magnificent palace tent of the Sultan, lined with rich 'brocade and gilded top. This landscape is animated by a moving curiosity shop, so varied and so changing that it is almost as difficult to single out one or another object as to follow the intricate pat6ern of a bright Turkey carpet Reverend looking Mlollahs, with long flowing robes, venerable beards, and enormous felt caps on their heads, cut into almostevery kindof geometrical figure imaginable, circular or:cylindrical, conical or parabolical, and man and cap perched on a fully accoutred cavalry horse,-these3 half judicial and half clerical gentlemen are hastening on their hard-mouthed ambling jades towards the tents destined for the learned bodies. Others less high in their profession, in picturesque white turbans of less presumptuous size, in easy, comfortable-lookingi cloaks and wide garments of subdued colours, are standing about in groups or moving about among the crowd. Solitary dervishes of every Mahomedan race and of every colour, from jet black to dirty white, are promenading in dignified raggedness like so many Diogenes, with the traditional black bowl instead of the lantern never begging but always ready to accept. There are Turkish officials of every size and rank, supremely ridiculous in their Europeanized badly-fitting uniforms, some in carriages dlrawn invariably by: under-bred brokendown Eturopean horses, others on magnificent Arab chargers with gold embroidered saddle-cloths, and a shabby-looking retinue galloping after them Others, again, sitting down in the open tents, smoking, looking at the crowd or being looked at, listening to the wild fantasias of a number of Gipsy bands with instruTnents of the manuifacture of Tu-bal or one of his lmmnediate successord. Then come the representatives of all nationls and races which the Eastern Babel, Stamboul, harbours :_ Thorouiglh-bred Stamboulis, still sticking to their cool like dressing-gown, robes, the wide trousers, and noiseless slippers, and showing in every one of their movements the conscious dignity of the conquering race ; athletic-looking Anatolians, in their manycoloured turbans, the short vest, voluminous sash round the waist, knee breeches, tightly fitting to the leg, but wide above, worsted leggings, and red shoes; daring-looking f(urds, with high turbans built up sideways, in the style of the tower of Pisa, baggy trousers, and red boots ; solemn black bearded Persians, in shawl gowns, with thin, high pointed, black lambskin caps and dandylike canes. Albanians, in white, many-folded linen kilts and embroidered jackets, with an arsenal of pistols and daggers, and their swaggering gait. You can see the modest-looking Bulgarian, in his brown suit and sheepskin cap, and his opposite the noisy Greek, in his baggy breeches; the grave Armenian,with his Nineveh bull features, and a motley crowd of Levantines and Europeans in carriages, on horse- back, and on foot. To set off the whole scene aU the harems of the capital have poured out their contents, from the Sultana, in all her magnificence, dowvn to the negro woman who has left the scullery to see the fetes. Indeed, it is most likely this portion of the crowd will attract most of your attention. Every one who can afford it contrives to get avehicle of some kind, andan amateur could study thehistory of carriage-building fromritsorigin through all its phases down to the most gorgeous modern structures. The carriages of the Sultana and the Kadines, with four richly-caparisoned horses overloaded with silver and gilt harness, the outside of the carriage likewise overloaded with silver and gilding, the coachmen and running footmen ditto, contain inside, between silk cushions,an ever-moving fan of peacocks' feathers and a half mysterious veiled beauty. Besides this gorgeous turn-out, there will be, very likely, something which will remind you of Noah's Ark as exhibited in picture books for children, mounted on wheels and drawn by an emaciated stoical-looking steed. Instead of beasts and fowls, the structure will contain as many more of the veiled women as it can hold, The neighbour of this is probably a gaudilypainted araba or cart, covered over with a piece of carpet, and containing the same cargo. Then come parties of women and children on foot, dragging their slippers throigh the dust. All this female world is crowded around two centres of attraction, which are in close neighbourhood of each other; these are the tents of the Sultan and all his dignitaries, and a temporary stage, on which rope dancers and saltirnbanuqzws exhibit their tricks. It is 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and an artillery ealvo, coming up from Tophan6, announces that the Sultan has left his Pnlace, and is on his way to visit the children who have been circumsized that day. Considerable excitement prevails in the crowd. Th3 officials who are behindhand basten to the placai assigned to them; those who are only curious press forward to get a good view of the proceedings. A cloud of dust, in which you can distinguish strong glimpses of red, approaches, aud when it comes near you can see the Commander of the Faithful driving along in his phaeton, and after him his crowd of household officers in blue with gold, and his bodyguard in red, every one of them on horseback. Everybody stands up, folds his hands on his stomach locks to the ground, and the most impressiv3 silence, the sign of the awe which he inspires, accompanies him all along his passage. He arrives at ths top of the plateau through a double line of troop3, -the riflemen who won the battle of the Ingur under Colonel Ballard's command,-and alighti before his gold-topped green tent. To the left of txe Imperial tents are those of all the great dignitarie3 of the Empire, from the Grand Vizier downwards; and in front of this line is an open space, enclosel by a chain fixed on posts, which separates it from the crowd and the rope-dancers. The Sultan stands before the open tent, and, one after another, he receives the homage of his dignitaries, who come up with measured step, touch the groumd with their hand three times, and .fold their arms. When this is over the Sultan retires to dine, as usual, by himself, and everybody-that is, who has sufficient rank to be an acting personage, prepares to do the same. Great excitement in all the official tents. The traditional bright yellow metal tray is brought in, and on another follow the dishes; the basin for washing the hauds is handed round,iandlyou can seethe pillarsof the Statediningc in public. Those who have no claimtobefedat the public expense betake themselves to the numberless tents to smoke their pipe or narguil6, and drink coffee or one of the varied beverages known under the generic name of " sherbet." Others, who have more substantial tastes squat down before an itinerant roaster of kebabs; others, more modest, apply to one of th3 host of water-sellers who form, if not the mo,t prominent, at any rate, the nosiest part of th3 crowd. There seems a moment of comparative rest for every one except the ropje-dancers, acrobats, and clowns, who, hot and perspiring in their dusty dresses, go through their painful evolutions. After dinner the Sultan goes round to see the patient3 operated upon on that day, and towards dark retires to his palace. By sunset, except the sentries and those who have charge of the children, everybody is gone; but the display is not over yet, for aS the time when the Muezzin calls the faithful to night prayers there is anew salvo of artillery, fol. lowed by fireworks on the Bosphorus. Several floating stages have been erected along the whole channel, and from these varieties of pyrotechnical art are exhibited, which, although inferior in quality to what we are accustoimed to see in Europe, far surpass in effect anything exhibited there on account of the magic beauty of the scenery as seen by the pale light of the fireworks. These fetes are to last for 10 or 11 days, during which every day several hundred males, some of them above 20, are circuracised in the whole empire. A list of as many as 79,C00 is said to have been made out. The Sultan bears the expense, which is not small, as the patients, besides being fed during the time of their convalesence, receive a present. But this expenditure has the advantage of beiug popular and national. Among all the change3 which the Turks have witnessed lately, they feel gratified to see that something which reminds them of their olden times of glory. The subscriptions for the new Bank are not pro gressing so rapidly as the promoters of th3 Echeme hoped. The sum subscribed has been for several days fluctuating between 800,009 and 000,000 Turkish pounds. Since the improvement of the money-market in England has become known, a rumour prevails that Messrs. Wilkin are again coming forward, and that they had received a telegraphic despatch announcing that their constituents were ready to accept the terms granted to the new company. As no term has been ,fixed in their concession during which they have to make the deposit, and as the Turklish Government has not yet concluded with the new company, there is nothing in the way of a renewal of negotiation , except a noti6cation wbich the parties in Englan3 received from the Turkish Ambassador in London, to the effect that the Turkish Government, seeingt the impossibility in which they were to carry out their project, considered itself absolved from obligation against them. SPAIN. (Pnoes oui owN conRsPONDENT.) MADRID, JuLY 5. The Congress sat until 9 o'clock last night, and voted the authorization of the law relating to the press. The Ministerial whip had succeeded in getting together, or preventing from leaving Mladrid, a majority of 174; only 21 deputies were sufficiently courageous and independent to vote against the measure. A number of ex-journalists, whose pen has been their stepping-stone to public life, voted in the majority; among others the ex-Liberal and oldest journalist in Spain, Senor Martinez de la RIlosa, President of the Chamber. This important measure being passed, and the hot weather having set in in earnest, hooks of steel would not keep the deputies in Madrid. They will be trooping away by scores, and the session will be over in the course of the week now commencing. It is not likely that there will be any more discussions of an important and interesting nature. It is said that Sartorius proposes entering on a defence of his conduct $and ministry in 1854, which wiU probably give rise to scandal and recrimination of no interest out of Spain. To-day's newspapers confirm, with additional details, the information transmitted to you yesterday respecting the disturbances in Andalusia. It appears that recruiting for the insurgent foreehad been going oi in Seville for soeie days, and in the most barefaced manner, without interference of the authorities. The chief of the rebels is one Caro, a half-pay major. Some accounts say that Sisto Camera and Beeerra, two well-known democrats, are with him, but this does not appear certain. Caro styles himself commandant-general of the province. In Arahal they committed great depredations, destroying the archives and carrying off 4,000 or 5,000 dollars. They then took the direction of Moron and Osuna. The latter place is said to be an excellent position, but it is hardly likely they will make a stand unless their numbers have greatly increased, although the troops in their immediate pursuit are not numerous. There was great agitation in Seville, and fear of disturbances, but the measures taken by the Captaina General will doubtless prevent these. The JAurnl des D&bats, of the 2d inst., contains one of those articles on Spanish affairs, professing to be founded on authentic intelligence from Madrid, with which it occasionally thinks proper to disfigure its columns. Those articles are perfectly well under stood here,and are known to be fabricated,or at least based on statements supplied, by agents of the Spanish Government. It would be an unprofitable encroachment on your apace and on the patience of your readers, to refute, as might easily be done, paragraph by paragraph, the misappreciations,incor rect statements, and positive fictions, contained in that now referred to. Any one who has paid even moderate attention to what has passed in Spain since Narvaez came into power, and in the Cortes during their two months' session, wil perceive at once that the article is utterly worthless and completely opposed to the truth. It may please Marsaal Narvaez and hia colleagues to see a first-class French journal dispensing to them a full measure of undeserved praise, which a few persons find their advantage in concocting; but it is rather surprising that so respectable a newspaper as the DMats should be deluded or persuaded into adnitting into its generally well-informed columns such a farrago of fulsome falsehoods. Apprehensions of disturbances in Madrid are still rather general, although I continne in my conviction that nothing serious will occur. The Government would perhaps not be sorry that there should be some slight breach of public order, as this would give it the opportunity of making examples and of proclaiming martial law. I hear that between 10 and 11 o'clock last night there was a co7rrida (panic running) in a populous part of Madrid, but I was out a good deal between 10 and 1, and saw not the slightest sign of disorder. People, however, are in a nervous excited state. I know positively that in the Barrios bajos, the Lavapies, and other low quarters of the town, inhabited almost exclusively by the lower orders, there prevails a strong conviction that we are on the eve of commotions. Anyp thing of the lind that may happen will, according to all appearance and probability, be promptly checked, perhaps with a very heavy hand. The passion for bull-fighting seems on the increase rather than on the wane. Yesterday afternoon an amateur display of this kind took place in the usual arena. There exists here a societY of armateur bulllighters; but, judging from their yesterday's performance, the art must be difficult to acquire, or they bave notXsufficiently studied it. The bulls were young and little fellows. One man got his face ripped open, andwas thought to be badly hurt, but he afterwardsre- appearedandkilled his beast. Although there was a limit to the distribution of tickets, the attendance was large. Anything in the shape of a bull is a monstrous attraction here; and then it was said that a nurmber of ladies of the Spanish aristocracy would appear in the well known fanciful and very clggagg costume of the maja, or Andalusian grisette. The only Spanish lady of note, however, who did this was the Duchess of Medina-Celi, who had accepted the responsible and honourable office of special president and patroness of the performance. On the other hand, a charming Russian lady lately arrived in Madrid, and who, on the principl] of tout nouveau, tout beau, is, doubtless, in love with Spain and its ways, donned for the day the mantilla and the fan, and kept the beautiful duchess in countenance by appearing as her counterpart, much to the admiration and a little to the amusement of all who beheld for the first time a Muscovite Am. bassadress in the character of an Andalusisn maja. This being Sunday, there is no Bolsa. ITALY. The Opinione of Turin states that the present session of the Piedmontese Chambers wiU close next week. A letter from Genoa of the 5th, in the Opintione of Turin, says ;- " Small deposits of gunpower are found daily by the police, especially in the Sestiere Pre. Arrests still continue. Miss White is kept under arrest at her own residence. A house was sesterday searched, in which the police found a copy of the instructions given to the conspirators. They are of so atrocious a nature that one is seized with horror at the idea of what would have been the fate of Genoa had the insurrection succeeded." Another letter from Genoa of the 6th inst. states that the arrival of the steaml-boat Calabrese from Naples was anxiously expected. The only further accounts received of the proceedings of the insurgents on board the steamer Cagliari was that they landed with cries of " Liberty for ever !" When the Neapolitan frigates captured the Cagliari there were only three wounded insurgents on board besides the Sardinian captain and crew. The passengers had been left at Ponza. The mnails which the Cagliari carried were delivered up to the Sar dinian Consul, but the ship was seized. A further landing of insurgents at Reggio is spoken of. They are said to have sailed from Malta, and are composed of English, French, Swiss, and Itahans principally 3Iilanese. The Monitore Toscano, of the 4th, states that since the proclamation of the state of siege at Leghorn, public tranquillity has not been again disturbed in that city. The Pope arrived at Modena on the 2d. A telegraphic despatch, received at Rome, states that the same dlay the Holy Father, after celebrating mass in the cathedral, and admitting the clergy and the religious corporations to pay their respects to him, gave his benediction to ihe Modenese troops from the balcony of the palace. The population are described as filled with enthusiasm for his Holil ness. All the bishops of the duchy are assembled at Modena, as weeU as many from other states. The health of the Pope continues excellent. A letter from Rome in the Cologne Gazette states that the endeavours of Count de Ravneval, as of several French prelates, to reconcile the Courts of Rome and Turin have proved unsuccessful. The great impediment is the exiled Archbishop Franzoni, who represents, as it were, the principle of the Church of Rome; but it is said that he is willing to resign his see in the event of the Sardinian Government consenting to modify its interpretation of he treaties concluded with the Holy See. BELGIUM. His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, travelling inco9nito, arrived at Brussels on Wednesday morning. The Prince afterwards visited the battle. field of Waterloo, and then proceeded on his journey to Germany. An Electoral Committee, composed of MM. L. Verest, President, and H. H. Boeye, J. E. do Shepper, and P. Van Wtberge-Van Hesse, members, has been formed for the definitive election of a member for the arrondissement of St. Nicolas on Saturday next, M. Nothomb, the Minister of Justice, having withdrawn. Although no official communication has yet been made the name of the Pzincess who is going to espouse the Ring of Portugal is no longer a secret. It is that of the Princess Stephanie Frederique Wilhelmine Antoinette, eldest daughter of Prince Charles Antoine of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. The Princess was born on the 15th of July, 1837, and is, therefore, just 20 years of age. ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES. (Proar oui owN cOmnsi?oxDnmrs). SOUTHAEIPToN; FRrDAY, l0 A..

CHINSE INF A hEACMINES.-On Sunday, the 3d of May. at 4 a.m., it being a dark rainy morning, a tremendous explosion took place exactly ahead of the Acorm and so close as to shake the ship all over, immediately afterwards fragments of a very large infernal machine floated past, and many pieces were caught by the spars that are rgged out all round the ship as a protection against fire rafts. The pmnace and cutter were sent ahead, and discovered at the distance of half-a-mile a strong bamboo rope, attached to a pile driven into the bed of the river. This rope was found to lead from the pile under water to the Acorn's cable, to which it was attached some feet under water. ThLis must have been done by a diver during the night, as the anchor had been weighed the day before. The machine which had contained the powder was attached to rings, by which means It would slide easily along the rope fastened to the cable; from each bank was a line, also fastened to the machine to guide it. The banks of the river being high would entirely conceal the men employed in guiding it. Part of a fine trigger line was also found leading to the nearest bank of the river. The machine had evidently been floated down along the bamboo rope, and guided by the lines directly ahea4 of the Acorn, and had the firing been delayed one minute it must have exploded immediately under the bows and destroyed the vessol. Most fortunately, however, tho guard boat, which had returned to the ship for a fresh crew, had just shoved off and was pulling inthe direction of the exactpointof thebankbehind which was tho man guiding the machine. He must have thought himself discovered, and pulled the trigger an iDstant too soon. From two pieces of the fragments of the vwhole length and breadth it was found that the machine had been a strong wooden tank, rendered waterproof, and capable of containing more than 20001b. of powder. Ac4bxixY oF Soncgs.-At the kst sittlng M1. Leverrier adverted to a subject which had more than once been brought by him under the notice of the Academyviz., the execution of an object-glass of the enormous diameter of 52 centimetres (upwards of 20 inches), which a hI. Porro, now in Paris, had since November, 1856, annnounced as having been constructed by him. The astroomers of the observatory had desired to eee this objectglass, but they bad always been put off under some pretence or another. Meanwhile h1. Porro had caused articles to appear in various French and foreign scientific journals, in which not only this invisible object-glass was lauded to the skies, but sneers were addressed to men of science who did not wish to patronize a thing they had not been able to Eee; the tauntingexpressionof "Savans chargus de la science o,tcidle" had been used, and they were accused of wilfully ignoring the wonderful properties of the objectglass in question. Now, he (AL Leverrier) begged to state, in the name of tho Observatory, that when they applied to the inventor for leave to see It, he replied that his object-glass was not yet fit to be shown; and that on a second application various objections were ,gain made by M. Porro. Meanwhile he had announced a new star in tho constellation of Orion, which he said he had disoovered by liis object-glass and Father Secchi, of Rome, had in a letter confirmed the statement, announcing that he had observed the same star with an object-glass of 24 centimetres; whence it might be inferred that one of 52 centimetres was no better than one of 24. M. Leverrier therefore begged tho members of the committee appointed by the Academy to investigate the matter to inform him whether they had been able to make any observations with the object-glass in question. hL de S6nermont, in the name of the committee, replied that .M. Porro, while he already attribated great powers to his object-glass, bad nevertheless pointed out to the committee certain imperfections which he was now engaged in removing. The committeo had charged h. Porro to execute a disc of a large diameter; and if he succeeded in making a largo spherical surfaee of a given diameter ho would certainly go far to solve the problem of achromatism. M. Leverrier then observed that, as the inventor bimself confessed that his instrument was still imperfect, he ought to have abstained from publishing suah pompons articles on the subject. A letter was read from hI. Goldschmidt on the subject of the last planet discovered by bim, being the 45th telescopic planet hitherto observed. The elements areJune 27, mean time, Paris, 11 h. 45 m. 30 sec. ; right asension, 20.95 sec.; declination, 2m. 56sec. June 28 mean time, Paris, 10 h. 4 m.; right aseension, 53.46 see.; ieclination, 4m. 48 sec. The right ascension and declination are calculated frona the star of the 9th magnitude in Bess catalogue, the positions of which are :-(1800.) Right asCension, 16 h. 21 min. 27 sec. ; declination (south), 11 deg. 31 min. AL Dien communicated the parabolic elements of tha comet discovered by him at Par oD the 23d ult., aad by Mi. Ninkerfues at Berlin on the 22d. The elements are as follows :-Passage through the perihelion, 1857, July 18 00238 mean time of Paris. Perihelion distance, 0-306216i longitude of ascending node, 23 deg. 29 mi 37 sec.; rongitude of perihelion, 15 de.39 min. 40-8 sec.; inclination, 120 deg. 49 miu. 39-2 sec. ahe brilliancy of the comet will increase until about the middle of the present month, when it wiiU be visible for a few days with an opera-glass; it wil then rapidly decline In briliancy, and disappear in the corrse of the first days of August. During the month of July it will successiveily pass through the constellations of Auriga, Lynx, and Leo, the latter of which it willl enter on the 1uth. On the 26th tt will be in the neigh. bourbood of the star Regulus.
BLECTION OOMMILT.VES. VAVn IATrmmrv% Tbe Committeo yesterday proceded wlith the hearing ef evidence on the part of the sitting 3amnber. Dr. Thoma M'Greal, a medical msn, praotiing at Castlebar, and a voter for the county, proved that he had wrltten the placard containing the resolution of the Roman Catholic bishops, and gave the Bame account as a previous witness (Colonel Knox) with respect to tho circumstances under which it was written. The placard, a1ter a copy of the re. Eolutlon had been added to it, was printed. also gava evidence with regard to the conduct of Curly, the prlest, at Castlebar, who, he said, had exhorted the peop?G to kesp quiet, as the opposite party wanted to entrap them into macing a disturbance. He saw nothing violent in Curls's conduct in the course of the nomination. On the whole, the election was excoedingly quiet. He was a supportr of 3Mr. Moore. Tle witness was cross-examined by Mr. O'ALLzY withi reference to a meeting at his house previous to the election, at which Mr. Moore had addressed the people from the window. Among various expressions attributed to Mr. Moore, but which witness did not remember to havo heard, was that the priests of Tipperary had " Put the seal of their flaming denunciation upon the brazen frout of the Palmerstenian faction." (Laughter.) Mr. Moore did call uport Mayo to follow the example of Tipperary. Patrick Hanley stated that previous to the nominations at Castlebar, Coleman, the sheriff's bailiff, had made arn appointment with him. About 16 men attended at the place appointed in the evening, and Mr. Maley, the deputy sheriff, and Coleman were present. The men receLved 2s. 6d. each from Coleman, and directions were given them as to what they were to do the next day. In answer to Mr. O'AL&E, Mr. KRsAsxz said, the object of this evidence wras to prove that a mob had been hired by one of the deputy sheriffs in the interest of Colonel Higgins, to create a dis turbance. The witness further said that drink was given him, which had the usual effect of maling him drunk. (laughter.) He and about 20 others had gone to Colonel Higgins's com. mittee-room and shouted up and down for about half-an. hour. He was drunk, but not too drunk to shout. They excited the town and had a fight with the inhabitants. He was " left stretched." (Laughter.) He went and spoke to the sheriff, who told him to lay an information. He said he had no money, and a message was sent to the clerk of the petty sessions to say, with Mr. Higgins's compliments, that o would pay the expenses. He lodged an information against two men;. They also lodged an information against him, and he was out on bail. He and the other men were told that if Colonel Higgins was not allowed to speak at the nomination they were to shout and prevent Moore and Palmer from being heard. The people heard Mr. Higginz, and they did not shout. After the nomination they went home. On the nextdaybe got 7s. Some of the men got5s., but those who were in the fight ot 7s. He received altogethor 17s. during the election, and Is. more when it was over. He still claimed 18s. for his work. (laughter.) By Colonel NonTi-He was not very sober at the Court-house. That was about 10 o'clockin tho morning. (Laughter.) On cross-examination the witnes said that he was very tipsy last night, and wvas put to bed by the waiter at his hoteL He kept sober till 4 o'clock yeaterdayafternoon because he expected to be called up to give hiq evidence, and then he began to get drunk. (Laughter.) He drank with some Galway men last night, and did not lose his memory tiU about 10 o'clock. (Laughter._ Mr. Armstrong had given him money in the evening. _se had a couple of shillings in his pocket when he arrived in Iondon. He had made notes of his expetidi. ture by the way, but (after Eearching his pockets) he had lost the notes. The pencil he made them with was gone, too. (Laughter.) The first thing ho did when he got to London was to buy a glass of whiskeyand abox of matches. (Great laughter.) XIr. Armstrong had told his mother that he would brmg him home safe. He did not remember saying before he left Castlebar that he would " do the business." About a month after tho election he had gono to Fatbor Hosty to get forgiveness for being Higgins's man. Father Hosty forgave him on the spot, and bid him go to confession. He did go to confession to a strange priest. Mr. KAnRLAKE objected to any questions being asked as to what had passed at the confessional. Mr. O'IMALEY hoped it would not be laid down that a man was not to be asked with respect to what had taken place at his confession. The CHRAIRs3L% observed that this was delicate ground, and they should proceed. with caution. Cross-examination continued.-He had fasted for three Fridays on one meal, and said some prayers for having been Higgins's man. Ho was not employed top prtect Cole. nel Higgins's voters, but to shout in theoCourt-house. By the ConTrTEE.-He had gone to ask forgiveness both for being drunk and for being ffiggins's man; especially for being Higginss man. He had taken the pledge for a month, and kept it. Ho had taken the pledge about three time3 within the last six years. He had once taken it for 12 months, and kept it for 1. Mrt. Armstrong, the landlord of the hotel at Castlebar, proved that there was no placard outside his hotel during the election to the effect that Moore and Palmer had committee-rooms there. Mr. Francis O'Donnell, under-agent of Sir Roger Palmer, and a supporter of Moore and Ps1mer, gave evidence as to the tranquility of the counaty duriDg the last election, and stated that in his opinion the deputy sheriff at Ballina had acted partially during the polling. P. O'Dowd, shopkeeper at Swinford, said that the town wvas tranquil during the election. He voted for Moore and Palmer, and stones were thrown into his house. P. Staunton, who kept apublichouseat Swinford, and had voted for Moore and Higgmns, gave similar evidence with regard to the state of the town, and also gave an account of the meeting between M1r. Curran and Mr. Moore in the street. Frank Tweeny said that he had been stopped by a mob at Newport on his way to Castlebar to vote for Moore and Palmer, and taken to the hoase of George O'DonnelL the son of Sir R. O'Donnell, where dancing and drinking were going on. Sir R. O'Donnell asked him to vote for Colonel Higgins, but he replied that Lord J. Brown was the best gentleman in the county, anid wherever he went to he (witness) would go. Tho next morning (Monday) he was violently dragged by five men into a boat and taken to an island, where he passed that day and night, and was not landed until the evening of the Tuesday. He was landed about 12 miles from Castlebar. He was thereby prevented from voting. At the conclusion of the witness's examination, Mr. E. Jna1ES said he had an application to make to the committee, founded upon information that day received by Colonel Higgins. It appeared from the statements contained in two letters which had been sent to Colonel Higgins from Castlebar, that two witnesses, M'Loghlan and Gannon, who had been examnined before the comrittee, had, since their return to Castlebar, after giving their eidence been attacked by a mob and serionsly maltreated. One of them took refuge in a shop, but he had his eye poked out by an iron bar, and was nowv lying in the Infirmary. It was at first supposed that the matter must be brought under the notice of the House, but he found it laid down in auy'ssPar1iame,aear7s-Ps-actj, that any attackuponwitnesses inconsequence of statements made before a coimnittee was a breath of privilege, and that the committee could issue their ;arrant against the persons proved to have been engaged in it. A person named Sheridan had been seen taking an active part in the mob which had maltreated these witnesses, and he therefore had to apply to the committee for a warrant to summon Sheridan, together with the witness M'Loghlan, before them, in order that anv ulterior conrse which the coinmittee thought proper mnight then be adop ted. The CoiD. E deliberated for a short tine with closed doors. The CsruIRamtN then said that the committee vished to swear ColonelHiggins tothelettershe had received, and they would then report the faets to the House, in order that the House might take such steps as it thought proper. Colonel Higgins was accordingly sworn, and put in the letters containing a statement of the facts mentioned by MIr. E. James, w.hich he said he had.eceived that morning. They w ere both dated the 7th of July, and signed by James Conry and Thomas Cook. To the bese of his belief the letters were in the handwritingof the persons by whom they purported to be signed. The Committee then adjourned until this day. BURY ST. ED3UND'S. The Committee sat yesterday for the first time. Its members are Mr. G. Hardy, chairman, Mx. Byng, Mr. AdderLy, Mr. Stanhope, and Mr. Dunlop. Air. Edwin James, Mr. Rodwell, and mr. Quain appeared for the petitioner; Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Tindal Atkinson represented the sitting member. The petition, signed by Mr. Oakes, the unsuccessful candidate, contained allegations of bribery, undue influence, and treating against the sitting member, Mr. J. A. Hardeastle, by himself or his agents, and prayed that his return might be declared void, and that the petitioner might be declared duly elected, Mr. E. JAIES, in opening the case, shted that the petitioner was a banker in the borough, and had been returned for the borougl 3atprevious elections, and that Mr. Hardcastle was not connected with the borough, but had been introduced to st in 1&52 by a gentleman named Collins, an attorney, and tho registrar of the County Court, whose name would frequently occur in the course of this investigation. In 1852 Mlr. Oakes was returned by a majority of eight over 31r. Hardeastle. l.. Hardcastle then pre. sented a petition agpinst that return, which failed, ane' Mr. Oakes retained his seat until the dissolution occurred; but since 1852 the Hardcastle interest had been vhat was called " kept up" in the borough. The writ was senit dowvn to the borough on the 21st of harch, tbh nomination took place on Friday, the 27tb, and the elec. tion on Saturday, the 28th. The constituency numbered about 00, of whom not more than 12 or 15 were freemen. The resnU of the poll was-Earl Jcrmyn, 344; J. A. Hard. castle, 320; and J. H. P. Oakes, 266. Every one was astonished at the large majority obtained by MIr. Hardcast' over Mr. Oakes, inas nnuch as the Conservative interest was very powerful in the borough. Mr. Hardcastle was a Liberal, and had the support of the Dissenting interest. The cases of bribery which ho should prove couldbe divided into two classes-the first consisting of cases of individual bribery, and tho second of cases of systematic bribery to publicans, carried on by allowin voters to be treated Pt their houses: The learned counsel then mentioned the names of various cases in which money had been given to voters, and in which voters had been treated and sometimes made drunk. At the Fox Inn, the landlord of which supported the sitting member, and took voters up to the poll for him, hot suppers were provided, both on the nosnina. ton and on the polling days. On the polling-day also 28 people breakfasted there, and voters had been taken up to the poll in a state of intoxication. Besides thes cases of bribery and treating, he should also prove the colourab'e employment of voters as messengers. No less than 37 mes. seng rs had been employed, an exessive number for such a smal constitnency. If heproved thefacte which he had stated, he submitted that the ommittee would arrive at the cosiclusion that Mr. Hardeastle's majority had been improperly obtained, and that hi return was therefore voiM. Mr, W. Salmon, town-clerk and elegt1ol ,gd.tr5 cc,
ALRciA.-.Marshal Vaillant, Minister of War, has received a despatch from the Governor-General of Algeria, dated from the bivouac of Ait-el-Arba, among the Beni.Jenni, of the 3d, in which he gives an account of the capture of the village of Agnemoun-Isen. The despatch Estaes that the approaches to the village, which is situated at the extremity of the territory of the Beni-Raten, were very difficult, from the natare of the ground, every point of winch was protected by intrenchiments or ambuscades, cstsblli,hed with considerable art. In the atternoon of the 30th ult. General MfachIahon, who was keeping a strict watch on this village, perceived that the number of its defenders was less numerous than usual, owing principaUy to the retirement of the contingents of the Beni.Raten and the Beni-Fraoucen, who had made their submission; and he therefore decided on making an immediate attack. After detailing the manner in which the columns of attack were organized and their order of advance, which vas confided to the command of General Perigot, the despatch goes on to state that the French troops left Icheriden at 3 o'clock, and efftcted their movement up the steep approaches to the village with the greatc'st regularity, while the artillery and rooket brigade at the same time kept up a fire on the intrenchments of the enemy. At half-past 3 the firing became general on every point. The first intrenchments were vigorously defended, but the right of the attaeking party having succeeded in carrying the ambuscades which stood in their way, the Kabyles feared that their retreat would be cut off, and abandoned the position. At half-past 4 o'clock the village and all its defences were in the power of the French. The loss of the French amounted merely to 12 wounded, only ons case of which is considered serious. The contingents of the submitted tribes of the Beni-Raten and the Beni-Frooucen contributed materially to the success of the attack by making a movement on the rear of the vilage. The despatch also mentions an attempt made by the goum to destroy the supplies of corn which had been colleoted by the unsubmitted tribes in the vaUey of the Oned Sahel, but which was unsuccessful, owing to the attacking rarty falling in with a force so nurnerous that after a skirmish of some duration they were compeUed to retreat, which they did in good order, with the loss of one man killed and four wounded. Tho loss of the enemy was considerable. The Beni-Jenni, the Beni-Boudrar, and the Beni-Ouacif have all made their submWion and sent hostages. The despatch concludesby stating that on the morning of the 2d the divisions of Generals 3sac&ahon and Renault oculpied without resistance the conntry of the Beni-Monguellet, communicating with each other by their advanced posts. PRINCE NAPOLErON IN CORwwALL.-The Prince Napoleons and suite landed at Falmouth on Tuesday naorning last; they immediately proceeded to T'revince, the seat ox Miohal Williams, Esq., M.P. for West Cornwall, where they took breakfast; after which Mr. Wiliams showedthem his fine coUection of minerals, said to be the beet in Burope with which they were much delighted. He thee accorpanied them to the United Mines, where the Prince appeared to take great interest in the mode of conveying the miners up and down the shafts bY2 the man-engine and other wa;ithne' of the mines.
APPEALS. - - - - - o. _ HOUSE OF LORDS. JTYv S iFreseit-Thw LORD CHuACELLOlt, LoZ BRoUGHAM, Zord ST. LEOwA.RD'S, and Lio-d WENSLEyLynA.) O'FLARERTY AND OTHERS V. ld'DOWELL AND OTHERS. Their Lordshi~g sat this miorning for the purpose of giving judgment ian this case. The LORD COHACELLOR, in delivexing his opinion, said, this was an appeal against a decree of the Lord Chancellor in Ireland, dPismissing the petition of the appellants filed by them ag st the co-partners in the Tipperary Jolnt. Stock Banv, vvhioh had stopped payment wsithin the meaning of the 33d of George IL, cap. 14. The petition stated that at the time of suca stoppage the bank was indebted to the appellants and othercreditors to the amount of 430,0001., and thatthe assets only atounted to 50,000t. Itthen went on to state that proceedings had been taken under the JointStock Comnpanies' Winding-up Acts, in whioh the appellauts had no power to interfere. It then prayed that the joint and separate real and personal eBtates of the shareholders rAight be placed in the hands of trustees for the benefit of the creditors of the bank in accordance with the 33d of George il, e. 14. By the eighth section of that Act it was enaoted,- " That from and iamedlately after tao time that sny banker shial abscond, conceal bimself from his ortditore, or stop paainent or die. al his real estates, wvhether for lives, In fee simple o ftee t;ail, and all the personal etates,crsdts, and effectswhateoever, etther at lw or equity of wbich suchbanker shall be seIzed, poasesed of. orentitledunto atthe thne of bis death, orstoPing pAYment, or absconding, or concealiss himself from his credit,r. Shall be liable and subiect to I e payrnmnt of al and every bli debts, otwhat nature or kind esever the easme b, without any regard to priority of pref5rence in point of paYmen,tother thai and excelt such debts and encumbrances sa such banker sha"l contrat before he became a banker, aun( except such debts and encumbrances as shall be secured by deeds or conveyanoes registered acoording to the lirevllona Of thIs Act." The Lord ChanceUor of Ireland by his decree had dismissed the ietition on the ground that the 33d of George IL did not apply to joint-stock banks established under the provisions of the 6th of George IV., cap. 42. Ho (the Lord Chancellor) was of opinion that that decree was right, as it appeared to him that the provisions of the former statute were incormpatible with those of the latter. It was clear that the former statute referred to the individual banker, and not to joint-stock oompanies formed ,for the parposes of carsying on banks. If, eash time one of the shareholders in the bank died, the affairs of the bank were to be wound up and the whole of the property of the othor shareholders was to be placed in the hands of trastees until all claims agXainst the bank were satiafied, no jointstock bank could be carried on, and thus the intention of the 6th George IV. to encourage the formation of joint-stock banks in Ireland would be defeated. It was not contended that an affirmative statute, giving additional powers, would repeal the former enactment; but where the provisions of the former were incompatible with those of thelatter effect must be given to the subsequent statbte, and iuch portions of the first would be reTealed. Another objection, inhis mind, was that the 6th George IV. had enacted that all joint-stock banks should appoint a public officer, who should sue and be sued in their namo, and that upon judgment against such publio officer exeoution should issue against the individual shareholders. That was clearly incompatible with the provision of the 33d George IL, which vested all the banker's real and personal estate in trustees, for execution could not issue against a man wlho had been deprived of all his property. There were a great many other inconsistencies which he did not think it necessary to pursue, but after a careful consideration he hlad come to the conclusion that the provisions of the 6th George IV. were inconsistent with those of the 33d George IL, and he was therefore of opinion that the 8thsection of the 33d George II did notapply to joint-stock banking companies estabished under the 6th George IV., chap. 42. JnUder these c2ircumstances he considered the decision arrived at by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland to be correct, and the appeal must be dismlissed without costs. Lord BROUGAlI concurred in the opinion expressed by his noble aud learned friend, and complimented the learned counsel on either side upon the ability they had displayed in arguing the case. Lord S. LEoNARD's gave a history of the Banking-Aots in Ireland, for the purpose of showing the changes that had taken place in this branch of the law, and said that he entirely agreed in the opinion given by the Lord Chancellor, tht the decree pronounced by the Court below was correct, In consideration of the great apparent difficulties and doubts in the case, vvhich he trusted u-ore now finally settled by considering the 6th of George IV. as a new code of laws relating to Irish joint-stock banks, he should advise their Lordships to dismiss the appeal without coats. Appeal dsmssed without costs. lIr. ROLr applied on behalf of Mr. Hone, one of the respondents, for his costs. Ee had been brought before their Lordships? House upon a different question to that which had been decided by their Lordships. He had ceased to be a shareholder in the bank for sonne years, and he had been sought to be made liable upon the ground that he had not properly transferred his shares. The LORD C11AtCELLOR said he should make no order. The AIoRNERY-GENERAL applied, on behalf of the official manager, that his costs should be paid. The LOBD CHANCELLOR said that that would be for the decision of the Court below. He was, no doubt, entitled to his costs. BARING'S DIVORCE. Evidence having been heard in this case The LoBD CANCELLOo, in moving the second reading of this Bil, said that there was no doubt upon his mind that the act of adultery had been committed. He also was of opinion that Mr. Baring was unaware of the facts which had now been proved until his wife had eloped with Captain Gordon. He should therefore move that the Bill be read a second tine. The Bill was accordingly read a second time.

VICE-CRACEFLOIlS' COtTRT .Tm.T ( AU*TRf V. UROUHART. (Eefore e=*c?zancWor Sir B. T. KiNDmsum.) This bill was filed to enforce a covenant contained in the marriage settlement of Ur. and Mrs. Austin, formerly Miss Urquhar, by which the property settled was limited to them and their children, the covenant in question being entered into by her father, and being to settle an eighth part of an property which might come to him either in his own or his vife's right during the coverture. After the date of the settlement hMr.Xrquhart became entitled to certainproperty under the will of Louisa Urquhart, and also the life-interest in a sum of 18,0001. was bequeathed to his wife for her separate use by a Scotch testamentary disposition. Under these circumstances the question was whether either or both such Properties were subject to the covenant. Mr. Glasse and Mfr. Welford appeared for the plaintiffMr. Baily and Mr. C. Ha for Mr. Urquhart, and Mr. Walpole and Mr. C. W. Crouch for the trustees, who had answered separately, inasmuch as, unfortunate differences having arisen between the parties, each trustee had espoused the cause of a different party The VIC-CHANCoLLon thought that, as far as the pro. perty comprised in the will of Louisa Urquhart was concerned, there could be no doubt that such property was within the covenant, and therefore there must be a decree as to that. The case of the Scotch disposition was some- 'what different, inasmuch as a Io interest only was given to Mrs. Urquhart, and that life estat to her sseparate use' it could not, therefore, be said to belong to her husband in her right, and wasanot within the covenant. With regard to the costs, under the circumstances his Honour gave them to both trustees. (Before Rt;c-Thancelor Sir T. STUAuT.) SCOTT V.

The VICE-CRANCELLOR gave judgment in this case and said that the question arose upon a motion to restrain the defendants from publishing or selling any copies of a work called The Rcason Why, the plaintiffs being the proprietors of the copyrig,htin a work sailed 4 Guide to the Scietdifc )nowledgeeof Thinags Familia-, of which Dr. Brewer wras partly the author and partly the compiler, the work bein one of value and having already reached 11 editions. With respect to the character of the book, it did not-profess to be |an absolutely ortginal work, or to do more than afford infor. mation toyoung persons as t certain familiar phenomena of common life surrounding them. Dr. Brewer, in compiling it, had soliited inquiry andirformation from various uersons, and had had recourse to previously published works It was beyond all doubt that he could maintain a copyrght in such a work, having by his pains and labour collectedin formation fromi various sources and reduced it under sytemaati heads. This collection and reduction constituted the originality of the work, and it was a work the copy. right in which was entitled to protection, being very much of the character of a dictionary or cyclopaiia of science. At the same time ho could not hold that there was any such originaUty in the form adopted of question and answer-several works, such as Evenings at Home, &o., having appeared long before that of Dr. Brewer-as to pre. vent any other person from originating a work in similar form, so long as he employed his own resources and his own pains ad labour in its compilation. The question, theretore, was how far the defendants? work, 27we Reason Why, could be said to be original, or 'was obtained by an undue or unfair use of Dr. Brewer's work. The defendanta, or rather Mr. Philp, the compiler of their work, denied broadly that any idea or language had been taken from the plaintifi' work, and therefore a fair use of; it was almost excluded, though from other parts of the affidavit the inference necessarily arose that he had seen Dr. Brewer's work. In compiling a work of this description the author was entitled to look at all previous works on the subject, and in reading such a book as Dr. Brewer's, when any suggestion was made as to the sources of the information therein contained, he was entitled to have recourse to those previous authorities, which niRht not otherwise have occurred to his mind. It might also be a legitimate use of a previous work to see from it if any general heads had been omitted by him in compiling his own book. Was there, then, in this case what, was merely a fair use of the plaintife work? Several tests had been given as to what was termed the animus furTandi. An illegitimate use was where a man knowlng that a book, subject to copyright and entitled to protection, had been compiled from various sources common to all, instead of taking the trouble of searching into those sources for himself, was minded to avail himself of the labours and arrangement of the author without taking the pains and trouble of investigatin- and working for himself. The statement that nothing had'been taken from Dr. Brewer's work was manifestly untru un a comparison of the works, and it was to be regretted that Mr. Philp had not fairly admitted that he had seen the book, and to what extent he had availed himself of its contents. At the same time, he did not impute anything to the publishers of Thze Reason Why, the defendants upon the record; for, as to outward appearance, &c., there was no similrity between the two books. The case had been very fairly launched by the plaintiffs, though he might at once say that Dr. Brewer had taken an exaggerated view of his rights and of the extent of the imitation by Philp. His Honour then proceeded to investigate at some longth the instances addced of plagiarism from Dr. Brewer's work, and observed that, though the particular instances would not be much standing alone, yet the accumulation of a variety of these instances, a whole series coming in the same collocation, the slight colourable variation of Dr Brewer's phrasoology1 the occasional interposition as if b design of some question not' immediately connected with what preceded or followed, and certaiin variations which rendered the defendants' answers scientifically wrong all these circumstances produced something much strongerthax mere suspicion. With respect to Eome of the questions and anjswers, it was impossible that they could have been composed by two irndependent minds, unless some common source was pointed out, and this the defendant had failed to do. A considerable portion therefore of Dr. Brewer's book had been taken, and the question was what was to be done as to restraining publication of T1ie Beason Why, the complaint of piracy extending to about half only. Ho should have been very glad if he could have got from Philp a statement as to how much he had copied; but this was, of course, impossible after the affidavit denying any copyin at alL His Honour,-after referring to the remarks of Lord Eldon in " awmau v. Tegg,' 2 Russel, 385, and of Lord Langdale in "Lewis v. Pollarton," 2 Beavan, 6, as to restraining the whole of a work when part of it consisted of original matter, it being there laid down that a defendant who has intermixed orig; nal with pirated matter mast again separate them and bear all the mischief and loss occasioned by the separation,-said that this case was differently circumstanced, the defenddants' work from its form being capable of division, as if publIlhed in separate parts. JIe should be doing complete stie in the case by restraining the defendants from pubsiahing the matters contained in the 2d and 3d lessos of The Beason Why, and in the 5th to the 25th lessons inclusively, or any other artiles or article, passages or pas. sage, copied, taken, or coloarably altered from the book called A uide, &c., in the plaintiff' bill mentioned, and the plaintiffs would he ordered to bring such action as they might be advised, with an understanding to abide by any order to be made ass to damages.
COUBtT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, GuiLDHAL, JuLY 9. RYLAND A2hD SHORT AIXD CO. V. lAflES AND ANOTmRV. (Sittings at Nis Prius, before Lord CA16r: and Special Juries.) Aar. fL. Hi'1I and TAr. Hawkins were counsel for the plaintiffs; Mr. Huddleston and Mr. Phipson appeared for the defendants. The plaintiffs are metal brokers,; Mr. Ryland carries on business at Hiandsworth, and the other plaintiffs, Messrs. Short and Laurie, in London. The action was brought to recover their commission on the sale of 5,000 tons of iron, sold on account of the defendants, Messrs. Job and H. Haines, who are ironmasters at Tipton, in Worcestershire. The defendants pleaded never indebted, and fraud on the part of the plaintiffs, Short and Laurie. The transaction out of which the claim arose took place in 1852. In that year Mr. John Attwood was a large parchaser of iron, and on the 2-3d of December, 1852, Mhr. BRyland purchased for him, throu"h Messrs. Short and Laurie, from the defendants, 5,0oo tons, at 5l. 10s. per ton, amounting to 27,500., to be paid by an ac. ceptanee at four months. Bought and sold notes were exchanged. When the sold note was forwarded to the defendants they wrote to Messrs. Short and Laurie, stating" We hereby acLnowledge the receipt of thesold note, and agree to allow you 2 per cent. brokerage on the amount, to be dinded between you and Mr. Ryland." Mr. Attwood afterwards got into difficulties, but the defendants received from him on accountnearly 20,000Z., leaving due to them a balance of 7,5161. In December, 1856, Messrs. Short and aurie applied to the defendants for the amount of their commission. As no notice was taken of the application, they direeted their attorney to write, and in answer to that letter the defendants wrote-" We think your clients cannot have consulted Mr. Rylind, or they would have learnt that we had settled the question of commission with hirm two years ago." Short and Laurie referred to Mr. Ryland; he stated he had not been paid. When this was commtnicated to the defendants they expressed their regret that their first letter had been misunderstood, but repeated that they had settled the question of commission with Mr.Ryland, who informed thera that when a transaction made through him as agent had not been fully completed it was not his custom to take his commission. Messrs. Short and Laurie refused to act on this rule, although it was alleged that there was a custom in Staffordshire for brokers not to charge cemmission if the contraot was not carried out to the profit of their employers; and brought the action without the oa. sent of Mr. Ryland. Mr. William Short, one of the plaintiffs, proved the rule and facts as stated. On cross-examination. he stated that he bad represonted to the defendants that Mr. Attwood was a man of large pro. erty, and might have nid he was as solvent as any man in nuon. Mr. Attwood had since become bankrupt, and yald lo. in the Sound. His firm got the delivery notes of this iron, and placed them in the hands of the Borough Bank of inverpool, to secure their draughts on Attwood. In Jauary, 1862, they got a biU of sale from him of all his Poherty at Reland'. FNotvithstanding that, they belueed e ws slU olvnt. In Decemboer, 1852, he pledged hthem all Is diamonds, rings, and trinkets, Iozd C,iPBELL asked Mr. Hill whether. after such an admission, he felt justified in going on with the case. Mr. H. Him, having consuted hi clients, said he would submit to a nonsuit, but his cients wished to give some explanation, Mr. Short was then recalled. He stated that when Mr. Attwood gave them the bill of sale he had bought very largelyof iron. The market becmoe very much depreciated towards the dlose of 1851; it improved in 1852, but he refused to sell, although they advised him to do so. In 1852 he held between 30,000 and 40,000 tons, and, contrary to their advlce, continued to buy. When he stopped payment bis accounts were examined by Mr. Coleman, who reported that the estate would pay 20s in the pound. Twelve months after le stopped they were so convinced of the solvenoy of the estate that they advanced him 1,6001. on his aceeptance. Lord AMPBRILL sid that after the course the trial had talken he would only remark that the action had been very Improperly brought by Short and Laurie, and that they had acted very wisly in withdrawing from It. The plaintiffs were then nonsuited. BEOKWITa AND AWOTHnR V. 3ULLEy AND AN0rH . 3Ir. Wilde and Mr. Blackburn wer counsel for the plain. tiffs; Mr. Bovil}, Mr. J. Brown, and AMr. Woraley appeared for the defendants. The plaintiffs in this action are the executors of the late Mr. Beckwith, who was an underwriter at Lloyd's. The defendants, Mfessrs. Bullen and Hancock, are insurance brokers, and the action was brought to recover the amount of certain proninms alleged to be due from them to hr. Beckwith at his decease; his estato had since proved to be insolvent. The defendants admitted the amount of the claim, but contended that they were entitled to set off against it the amount of a lo6s which had arisen on one of the polides. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, contended that defendants should pay the amount of the premiums and take a dividend from the insolvents estate for the amount of the loss. The policies in question had been effected by the defendants on account of the East Indis Railway Company on a nit credee commission, by which they had guaranteed the solvency of the underwriters. Mr. Beckwith and a Mr. Young had carried on business as underwriters together, and had largo dealings with the defendants. Mr. Young had since become bankrupt, and his assignee had brought this action to recover his share of the premiums. The case waa tried on Saturday last before Mr. Justice Wightman. His Lordship held that under the provision of the Bankruptcy Act the defendants vere entitled to the set-off, and directed a verdict for them, with leave to the other side to move. The only question now was whether the defendants had the oame right as against Mr. Beckwith's estate. The couose of dealig between them was, that the parties thould adjust the losses from time to tine. If the brokers had received the amount of a premium from their clients it went into the cash account between them aud the underwriters, which was settledonceamonth,and the brokers gotlOpercent.on the amount of these premiums less the returns. The other premiums went into the credit account between them and thelunderwriters. It was settled once ayear, and the brokers received 12 per cent. on the balance of premiun, which they paid over. Evidence was given as tothis course of dealing between the parties, and the custom-of brokers, when an underwriter failed, not to pay over the amount of any premiurns due, but to hold them until the risks had run off and any losses were adjusted, and then pay the balance if it was against them, or, if it was in their favour, to claim against the insolvent estate for the amount. Lord CA&sMPz said that, as there appeared to be no contest as to the facts, he would direct a verdict for the defendants, with leave to the plaintiffs to move to enter it for them. Verdict for the defendants. This was the last special jury cause standing for trial in this court. His Lordship then proceeded to dispose of the common jury cases, but none of those tried were of suilicient im. po.tance to justify a reporL SECOND COURT. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, at GuildhaMl, before Mir. Justice W 1GiaxA.x and a Speciu Jury.) NfWALL V. meBSTER. Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Ii Smith, Mr. Webster, and Mr. Cleasby were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Bovil], Mr. Wordsworth, and Mr. Unthank for the defendants. The plaintiff for many years had carried on the business of a manufactnrer of wire rope in the Strand and other parts of the kdngdom under a patent, which expired in August, 1854 The defendants were ropemakers at Sunderland, and were licensees of this patent under the plaintiff, dennnBn~ very considerible profits, and stipulating that they wounl vay cerbin royalties to the plaintiff in respect of the wire ope, but theynow desired to escape from the payment of the royalties on a technical objection. The plaintiff in 1840 applied for this patent for manufacturing untwisted wire rope. at the time of the apnlicatiou a person named Eupar had lightened upon somAethng of a similar invention, and it was suggested that Newall and Kupar should come to some arrangement so that the patent might be taken out, and it was agreed that the plaintiff should have his patent for general use, and that Eurar should have a ropewalk meresy and they were mutuilly to defend the patent if it should be attaclsed. There never was a patent which ran through. its whole term without being inkinged and the defendants, finding the wire rope superseding the common hemp rope, endeavoured to see whether they ould -not entitle themselves to some of the profits, and they applied their machinery to the maling wire rope. Proceedings were then adopted against the defendants, an injunction was granted, and an action was brought, and it was tried in 1845. The result was a verdict for the paintiff establishing the patent, and proving the infringement by the defendants. The defendants then applied for a new trial, raising various nice points of law. The plaintiff saw a long vista of litigation before him, and considered it pradent to enter into an arrangement with the defendants, and it was agreed that the plaintiff should grant an exclusive right to the defendants to use the patent, they paying a royalty of 51. lOs. per ton for round rope and 71. per ton for flat rope, and they stipulated that they would not sell below a certain price - there was a covenant on the part of the plaintiff that he would not grant a license to any other person, and there was a stipulation that in case of any verdict being given deciding that the patent should be void, the royalty was to cease and be no longer payable, but that up to that time the royalty should be paid. The defendant was to pay one-third of the costs of defendIng any proceedings. Froma 1845 to August, 1854, very large profits were made by the defendants, but it was then discovered that a person named Wilkins had been infringng the patent, and proceedings were adopted against him and the validity of the patent was established. In 1852 it was discovered that Wilson was infringing the patent, and proceedings were instituted against him, but he brought forward in his fefence, for the first time during the long course of years the patent had subsisted, a publ;cation of one Albert, a German, which had been pubhshed in this countO prior to the date of the rlaiatiff's patent, in which there was a passage which indicated that Albert was of opinion that it was important that rope sbould be made witb wire untwisted, and so far he had anticipated the plaintiFs invention. The publication must have been a very obscure one for all practical purposes, as no onehad ever heard of it. An action was brought in the Queen's Bench, which stood for trial on the 5th of July, 1852. (We now adopt the words of Sir F. Thesiger.) This happened to be a most inconvenient time for the trial of a cause of this importance, a it was just the period of a general election, and many of tho leading counsel were absent from London with a view of having the honour of sitting in Parliament, and there was great difllculty in preparlng counsel, by groper instructions being given them, before the day on rhih the trial was to take place. The leading counsel for the plaintiff had a conference with one of the attorneys for the p laintiffon the day before the trial was to take place. On tee 5th of July all the parties appeared in court ready for the triaL The jury were sworn, 'when the counsel forthe plaintiff beingveryill-prepared to enter into the consideration of the exact bearing of Albert's publication, it requiring a great deal of very nice examination and discrimination, and it being in their minds most important that the patent which hadtuen only two years to runm, should not be injured by any adverse verdict, they suggested the propriety of entering into a negotiatUsn for the purpose of arranging the matter, in order to prevent a triaL All the parties were reluctant to the arrangement, but, yielding to the suggestions of their counsel, they permitted the negotiation to be entered iote, and accordig y counsel communicated together. The jury, no doubt, had seen similar cases. The jury were anxious that no time should be lost, and the judge, he said it with all respect, was a little impatient. The negotiation continued and in the present instance was brought to a conclusion, and the counsel signed an agreement that the plaintiff was to have a verdict, and was to give the defendant an unlimited license except as to the price at which the article was to be sold -that the bill was to he dismissed, the injunc. tion to be dissolved, the plaintiff to pay the defendanVs taxed costs. Those were the fioal terms agreed upon be- tween the counsel, and they ultimately received the sanction of the clients, without any objection on the part of the present defendants, except as regarded Wilson's having the unlimited license, and the payment of the costs, and they said that they ought to be placed on the same footing as Wilson in that respect ; and there certainly was an impression on the mind of the attorney for the plaintiff that some modification should be made in tho terms. The parties proceeded from the court to the office of the attorney for the plaintiff, and a long discussion took pLace as to the terms which shoUld then be made between Newall and Webster, bat ultimately Webster refused to enter into any arrangement, and they now insisted that an agreemaent had been entered into with them that they should be released from the payment of the royalty. The defendants also insisted that by the arrangement made with Wilson the patent was virtualy defeated, and therefore they were discharged by the provisions in the deed of 1845 from the payment of any further royalty. The action was brought to recover upwards of 3,0001. for royalties. The defence was that what took place on the 5th of Jnly was a virtual defeat of the patent, and that the defendant wa9s iot a patty to the agreement by which Wilson was given an uninmited license ; on the contrary, he complained of what had been done. The learned JIIDG;, in summing up, said, the real questionx was whvether the arrangement entered into on the 5th of July was a virtual defeat of the letters patent ? Wilson had extorted the compromise - it was not a voluntary compromise. The fear of thero being a hostile verdict led the plaintiff to consent to any terms Wilson proposed, and the effect of such an arrangement would induce other persons to adopt the same course as that pursaed by Wilson. If the jurythought it was a defeat of the patent their verdict would be or the defendants. If, bowever, they did not thinkc so, then they would come to the agreement, and it did not appear to him that the deFendanht were parties to it, nor was there any agreement on the part of the plaintiff that he would entirel let off the defendants from the pay. ment of any royaly in future. It remained ras a matter for consideration. The question would be whether the patent was virtually defeate, but, if they thought not, then the qUestiOn would be whether there was an agreement that tne defendant should be placed on the same termE as Wilson. The jury retired, but eventuaUyreturned a verdict forthe pl.aintiff-damages 4,6431., subject to reduction. During the absence of thejury The JUDGE said, if the. Jury found for the plaintiff he would give the defendants leave to move the Court, and if they found for the defendants he would give the plaintiff leave.

CASTIQUE V. TOVMtxY. Mr. Lush, QC., Mr. Roll, and Mr. J. W. Smith were for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. Brsndt ap. peared for the defendant. This was an action brought to recover certain biUs of exchange alleged by the plaintiff to have been intrusted by him to the defendant for the purpose of being discounted. Mr. Castrique is a wholesale fruit merchant, Mr. Townley is a broker in the same line of business, and it appeared that in May last the former handed over to the lUtter four bills in order, as the plaintiff said, that the defendant should get them discounted and pay over the proceeds to him (the plaintiff). Instead of so doing the defendant having eventually, about the 11th of May, got credit for them with is bankers, applied the amount in reduction of the balance due to hun from Mr. Castrique, sud espmecially of a large sum aleged to be owng to him for 150 barrels of raisins, bought by the plaintiff by smple. Ther vwas also a count for money due for currants-sold by the plaintiff to the defendant, and this item was not disputed. The defendant pleaded, among numerous other pleas, that he had alien onthebills in dispute, and also a set off against the amount claimed. The trial of this cause occupied the ater portion of the day, and many wituesses were calle on each ddoe; the plaintiff contending that these four bills were given for the specific purpose of the defendant getting them discounted and handing over to him tho proceeds; that the raisins on being examined were found not to equal sample; and that even if the defendant had a right to set off against the sum realized.by the biUs the price of the raisins, yet that the plainti naving repudiated the bargain on good grounds, such right was gone; that the defendant had afterwards endeavoured to seU the raisins, and by so doing, and by pledging the warrants, had himself taken to them. The defendant urged that in this transaction, as in many previoua dealings with the plaintiff, he had carried the proceeds of the bilistohis general running account with the plaiatiiL He said that the plaintiff owed him money, and totaly denied that any express contract had been entered ibto between himself ana Mr. Castrinue that these bils [ should be treated otherwise than according to their general rule; and as to the raisins, he sid- and many witnesses were produced to prove this, besides aa enormous number f samples-that in a large quantity, such as 7001 worth of such goods, Some portions would unavoidably be Inferior to sample, bbt that, on the other hand, some, as in thepresent case gere nerasy better than mple, so that on the whole the lObarrelsof raidn now in dispute were fully up to sample and a good average bulk. Mr. Jusice Cx WSSwx, in summing np the case to the jury, said that it was a most complicated one, but that he should leavethree simple questions for their determination: -first, Were the bils for the recovery of which the plaintiff now sued delivered to the defendant to be discountod, or to be carried to the general account between them? Secondly, Did the raisins equal simple? Thirdly, Did the defendant, after the plaintiff refased to have the raisins, take to them himself'? The jury having answered the first two questions as follows:-Theplalntiff delivered the bills to be discounted, and not to be carried to the general account. The ralsins did not answer sample; A verdict was entered for the plaintiff. Mr. BRANDT objected that the jury could only give the amount of the bills less discount M1r.

This was an action to recover 239. as money had and received to the use of the plaintiff. Mr. BoVTL (with whom was Mr. Needham) stated that thte plaintiff was a contractor, and that having brought an action against Mr. Hayward,the clerk to the D~r4ford Iocal Board of Health, the cause was referred to the defendants, who are eminentengineers. The defendants Proceeded upon the reference, which resulted in an award in favour of the plaintiff for 1.031. When the award was publishedl the plaintiff proceeded to take it up, in order to do which he was called upon by the defendants, as arbitrators, to pay their fees, amounting to the sum of 4361. Os. 9d. The Cnme BABoN.-How many pence, Mr. Bovill? Mr. Boviu.-9d., my Lord. The plaintiff was compeHed to pay this enormous sum in order to acquire a right to enforce 1081. against the defendant.

The Cnma BR&ox.-lNo doubt ; and I would suggest whether this is a proper tribunal to determine this cause, As at present advised, I think the action is maintainable. Mr. LnsH.-That being so, perhaps the best way would bo to state a case for the opinion of the Court and refer the amount, if necessary, to a barrister. Mr. BoviLL proposed that the reference should be to one of the Masters of another court. The Cm;F BA&RoN.-No. That would be ab codcen ad eundenz. A Master would approach the subject with a Master'sprejudice. The reference ought to bo to a barrister. A verdict was then taken for the plaintiff for the full amount, subject to the above arrangeraent. A SCRUPLE OF CONSCSENCE. In the progress of the above cause a gaunt figare entered the court, attired in the garb affected by the Society of F'riends, and wearing a conspicuous white bhat with a prodigious brim. Ie had not proceeded far when his attention was drawn to his breich of decorum and etiquette-to say the least of it-by a hint from the usher; but he replied with a "friendly" shake of the head, and marched stiffly and slowly to the further end of the court. At this point another usher of rather dvarfish stature, but more experience, approached, and told him to "take off hishat" in a tone which draw the eyes of all the Conrt on the offender. He, however did not remove his hat, but gravel bowed his bead til the brira of his hat came within reach of the usher, who, with equal gravity, removed the hat and pookltey eaturnedit tothhetowunrer.

On the 20th of June I was ving isn Wells-.tzeet, Stratford, in the conmty of Essex. It was. Saturday morning. About fivo minutesto9 I went out, lai lather an motlher ait breakfast When I went away no one else was there. Cross-examincdby Xr. SLrMxm-There was no quarrel between them. Father said, "Give usa drop of tea, old woman." I have heard words between them. She was a very passionate woman. M-argast 'Willinai sworn, aadd,-I am a married woman, and live in George-street. The prisoner is imy father. At the time of this occurrence I lived with hima In Wells-street, Stratford. It was a house with three rooms, two on the upper floor, which we lived in. I was At the house on the morning of the 20th, and left home about half-past s. My brother Dennis and my father and mother were there. I came back about half-past 9, and went to the foot of the stairs and called " other," but, she not answering, I went upstairs, and saw my mother lying upon her left arm. She was in a pool of blood. She was in a oomer of the room, and some of her brains were coming out. She was insensible. Iput her on to her back and raised the inhabitants, I fetched in the doctor and police. MY nother's pocket was lying in the middle of the room; it had the ap pearance of havng been cut off with either a knife or a pau of scissors. There was only one penny in it. In thecunboard of the room wasaatchet,whichusedto bekejptther-; it belonged to father and mother; it was covered with blood and hair. I gave it to the police. I recoUect my father coming home on the previous Monday, bht nothing happened. I have heard him threaten her. Cross.examined.-The house has but three rooms. This took place in the room we lived in. I found the chopper while Mfr. Valiance was in the roomi. Police-constable Benton, 381K, proved finding the deceased woman upon her back n the room, She was all over blood, and her head all chopped about. Mrx. Thomas Valiance, surgeon, proved being caoed in, and finding the deceased as described by the other witnesses. She was almost pulseless. She lingered until the following day. She died (rom loss of bloodand the weunds in her head. There were above 20. Alfred Smith, police-constable, was on duty near West Hamn on Sunday morning, the 21st of June. At about half-past 4 he met the prisoner. Not Inowing him, he asktd him 'where he was going. He was coming in the directioii of Stratford. WitneEs asked if his name was Mlichael Crawley, and he said it was. He then told him he should take him into custody for cutting and wounding his vife on the head with a bill. He was quite wet, and his trousers very much so. He asked him what a&do them wet, and he said he had fallen into a ditch upon Barling Marshes. Cross-examined.-He did not say he heard that his wife was dead. Stephen Walker, police sergeant, who was on duty at the station when the last witness brought prisoner in, seeing that he was very cold and wet, asked him to sit by the fire. He said to prsoner Crawley, " This is a bad job - you need not say anyting unless you like, but what you do say I hiall say against uo." Prisoner dropped his head and saidt "It is a ba iob; I done it." Ee said he was coming to give himself up. Cross-e:amined.-Something was said about a quarrel rescecting some nails, but I did not hear it. John Crawley stated that on the Sunday after the murder he went to see his father at the station. He said, "'ather, how came you to do it? You Ehould have stick her with your fist, and not use an instrwnment." His fatber said it all began about a pennvworth of nails. Witness aid, "Did vou cut off her pocket a' nd he aid " No.- Witness said, " Did you teke out the money ?" He said, "Ye, ard also some pawn tickets, which I put on the hob." Be again said the row began about the pennyworth of nails. This being all the evidence for the proeecutian, MIr. SLEIGH made a brief but eloquent api to the jury on behalf of the prisoner. He tendered his wariness thanks to his learned friend for the temaperate and humane way in which he had stated the case for the prosecution, and the manner in which he bad drawn their attention in his opening speech to the only issue which they bad to decide, and that was whether the prisoner's act was not that of manslaughter, however brutal, cotmmitted in the heat of quarrel and in a moment of frenzy. His LoRDssr, in summing up told the jury that the learned counsel for the defence Lad put the question of malice upon a very false issue. It was quite enoughto establish the malice aforethought to consider the nature of the weapon and the nature of the blows. To reduce a crime to m anslaughter it should be shown that the provocation given was in proortion to the, means taken to resent it, and he didnotmtinis case ee anything to justi the jury in reducing the crime to manslaughter. -is L~ordship then went tbrough the evidence, and begged of the jury to dismiss from their considertion tho result of their verdict as raised by the counsel, and not be scared from their du' The jury, after a few minutes' condderation, found the prisoner Guilty, but recommended him to mercy upon account of his age. lMr. Justice Wiru.Ar,-Your recommendation, gentlemen, shall be forwarded to the proper quarter. Silenoe having been proclaimed, His oRDsmap, in passing the eentence of deatb, said it was neither his duty nor intention to aggravate the horrors of the prisoner's position by dwellinguponthe circumstances of the horrid deed. He begged of him not to entertain any hope that the recomnmendation of the jury would obtain any mercy for him in this world,hbut to make use of the few Ehort moments left him upon this earth in praying through Jesus Christ for mercy bereafter. His Lordship then passed the usual sentence of death, and directed that the prisoner should be tak-en to the oounty gaol of Essex, there to sindergo his sentence.

Tile Hijgh uour& of J aiciary met again ~t to ol ckon -Wedneeday. , Tho DEAN Or PAcury ad4ressed the jury eoa bulialf of the prisoner. He said,-Gontlemen of thb 'TViry,-Thhe charge against the prisoner is murder, and t.he punishment cf mUrder is death; and that siepiq Atatenlent is suflolent. to suggest to us the awful Solemnity of tho occasioa which brings you and me face to face. But, gentlemeni there aro pecliarities in the prosent caso of e singular and strang a kind-there Is such an air of romance .and mystery in'vestedabout it from the beginning to the end-there is somjtbing zo touching in the age, the ser, ad the vocial position of the Accused-aye, and I must add that pablic a-ezitio4 iS S0 d4eoted to this trial, that they watch our proceedivgs, and * ang on our very accents with such anxiety and eagerness of expectation, that I feel almost bowed down and overw4lelmed by.the magnitude of the task wvhich is imposed.on me.' You are iavited and encouraged by the prosecutoi to sI ap the thread of this young life, and te consign to au igno ens death on the scaffold one who within a few short 40ouths -ws known only, as. a gentle and confidin aud, affectionate girl-the ornamnent and pride of her fhappy family, Gentlemaen, the tone ia which my learneamfriend addressed you yesterday could ioot fail to strike yoa r.S most - remarkable. It was charscttrized by great moderatin-bhy such moderation as I think must have conviaced yo thab lie could hardly erpect a verdict at your hands, andiin the course of that address-for *whioh I give him the higheast crediL-he could not resist the expression of his own deep feeling of commiseratioa for the position which the pri. soner is placed in, which was but at involuntary homage that the official prosecutor pays to the kind and generous nature of the man. But, gentlemen, I am going to ask yon for something different from commiseration. I am going to ask for that which I will not condescend to beg, but will loudly and importunatdy demand-that to which evety pri.oner Is entitled, whether she bo the lowest andvlest of her sex, or the maiden Whose purity 'is of the unsullied snow. I ask you for justice, and if you will kindly lend me your attention for tlhe requisite period, and if Heaven will give mue patience and strength for the task, I shall tear to. tatter, that web of sophistry. with which the prosecutor has striven to ivest this poor girl and her ead, strange story. The Dean then referred to the first introduction of L'Angelier to the prisoner-an introduction made in the street in such a way as showed he could not procure it, otherwise or elsewhere. He described him as an unknown adventurer, and, relating such parts of his earlier history as had been brought before them; he deo scribed his character as vain, conceited, aud pretentious, boastful of his personal attractions, and ever courting the society of ladies above hin in station, and endeavouring to push his fortune by means of marriage. He referred to :iis cha,ngeable and excitable character, and his frequent threats of suicide while suffering from disappointinent in love. Returning to the commencement of the prisoner's acquaintance with L!Angelier, he said he thanked the Lord Advocate for his admission, that, at that timae, though their correspondence was improper, because clandestine, yet the 7etters of the young lady breathed nothing but gentle. uess and propriety. The correspondence, h6wever, also showed that if L'Angelier had originally in his maind to corrupt and seduce this poor girl he had entered on the attempt with considerable ingenuity and skilL Their correspondence was apparently soon after dropped through the young lady's own sense of propriety, but in tho spring of 1856 It was unhappily renewed, and it was but fair to suppose rather on the importuniate entreaty of this young man than on the suggestion of the lady. The correspondence was for a time put an end to by lMr. Smith, and for a time that interference had effect, <"k,At alas th next 6cene was the most painful of alL In the spring of 1856 tls porrupting influence of the seducer was successful, and the prisoner fell. How corrupting tha; intluenceo mut have been, and ho'V yjj the arts wero to which he resorted for his nefarious purpose, eou; never ba known so well as by looking to the altered tone of this poor girls letters. She had lost not her vizue merely, but, as my earrned friend said, her sense of deceaoy. Whose fault was that? Whose doing was It? Think you that, without temptation, without vile teaching, a pobr girl faUs into those depths of degradation? No. Influence from without, most corrupting influence could alone account for such a fall. And yet, gentlemen, through the midst of this fright. ul correspondence, which I wih to Ood could have been concealed from your eyes and those of the public-and if it had not been, as my loarned friend thought, absolutely necessary for the ends of justice that it should be produced, I feel satisfied he would nob have done so-but even through the midst of this frightful correspondence there breathes a spirit of devoted, love towards the man who vwronged her that strikes me as most remarkable. Entering upon the case, the learned counsel remarked upon the little evidence that existed to prove that the parties had ever met in the house in Blythswood-square. From the 18th of November till the death of l'Angelhor there were only two interviows proved to have taken place within the house From all her letters it appeared that the condition of getting access to the house depended upon the absence of her parents from home. "If h. and P. go from home I could take you in at tho front door, and I won't let a chance pass." But that chance never came The Lord-Advocate seemed to say that there were some con. certed signals by rapping at the window or on the railings wvith a stick in order to attract attention. This you will lind is an entire mistake. L'Angelier did on ono or two occasions take that course, but the prisoner immediately forbade it, and ordered him not to do it again. In a letter wvhich bears the postmark of December 5, 1856, she says"'Darling, do not knock at the window;" and again in a postscript, "liemember, do not knock at the door," earnestly repeating this caution. Independent of their commuuications at the window, whatever they were, there were only two occasions-namely, those of which Christina Haggart spoke, on which they were proved to havo met within the house in Blythswood-square at all. About this time it is 4guite obvious that they had it in view to accomplish an sxovement. It was quite plain that the consent of Mliss Sutth's parents to her union with this young Frenchman was not to be thought of any longer. That hope .was altogether gono, and accordingly there are constant references in the letters, about this time, to the arrangements that were to be made for carrying her from her father's house aind accomplishing a marriage either in Glasgow or Edinburgh. The opportunity for that, ho.vever, never came. The Dean then proceeded to say :-We now arrive at a very important stage of this case. On the 28th of January the prisoner accepts Mr. Minnosh, and my learned friend says that from that time the whole character of her mind was changed, and she set herself for the perpetration of ono of the most cool and deliberate murders that ever was committed. I will not say that such a thing is absolutely impossible, but I do venture to say it is 'weU nigh incredible. He will be a bold man who will seek to set limits to the depths of human depravity, but on that subject aU past experience teaches us that the perfection evest of depravity is net rapidly attained. It is not by sach short, easy stages as the prosecutor has been able to trace in the career of Madeleine Smith that a gentle, loving girl passes at once into the savage grandeur of a Medea or the appalling wickedness of a Borgia. No, gentlemen, such things are not possible. There must be a certain progress in guilt. It is quite out of aU human experience ti suppose that, from the toneof love in which the letters at had passed before were written, there should be a sudden transition, I will not say to the loss of affection toro-=WrtU% 0lars--bject, but to that savage desire of> removing by any means the obstruction to her wisbes which the prosecutor imputes to the prisoner. Think for a moment how foul and unnatural a marder is imputed to her,-the murder of ono who within a very short space was the object of her love-an unworthy object-au unholy love; but yet while it lasted-and its endurance was not brief-it was a deep, absorbing, unselfisb, devoted passion. Yet it is the object of this love she isgnow said to conceive the purpose of murdering. Such is the theory you are asked to believe; but surely, gentlemnen, before you believe it, you will ask for demonstration, you will not be contented with conjecture or suspicion, and it wiU not be enough to say that the theory of the prosecutor is the most probable that is offered to us. Oh, entlemen, is that the manner in which the jury are to deao with suoh a case? Is that the kind of proof on which you are to con-vict of a capital offence? On the 19th of February, on the 22d of February, and on the 22d of March-for the prose- cator nas now absolutely fixed on these dates-the prisoner is charged with administering poison to the deceased. Observe, he does not ask you to suppose merely that by some means or other the prisoner conveyed poison to L'Angeaer, but he asks you to affirm thaton those three occasions she avih her own hands administered the poison. In all three charges he says, that she did wickedly and feloniously adMinister to, or cause to le taken by, the said deceased Emile L'Angelier, a quantity of arsenic. I do not dispute, gentlemen, that these charges may, in the absence of eyewitnesses, be proved by circumstantial evidence, but you must always bear in mind that circumstantial evidence must come up to this-that it must convince you of the perpetration of these acts. Now, then, in dealing with such circumstantial proof, what should you expect to find proved? Of course, that the means were in the prisoner's nands of committing the crime. The possession of poison will be the first thing that is absolutely necessary; and on the other hand the fact that the deceased on one occasion was ill from the consequences of poison; that on the second occasion he was ill from the same cause ; and that on the third he died from the effects of poison. But it would be tho most defective of all proofs of poison to stop at such facts as these, for one person may be in the possession of poison and another person die from the effects of poison, and yet that proves nothing. You1 mnst have a third element. You must not merely have a motive-and I shall speak of a motive by and by-you must not merely have a motive but opportunity, the most importantof all elements. You must have the opportunity of the parties coming into personal contact, or of that poison being carried to the murdered erson through the medium of another. Now, we shall see how far there is the slightest room for such a sugpicion here. The Dean then examined the first charge againsb the prisoner, the ad- nminisitrtion of poison on the 19th or *20th of '1Tebruaiy. Mrs. Jenlins-than whom he never saw a more adctsmte .n4 trustworthy witness-was able to fix, a date for-the ucond illness-namely, the 23d of Februail~; - but-A6h said that the first was eight or~ ten da-ys peviois to t'he second1' which would bring them baok to-tht 13th,-or 'thereAboqttand that he was ill. about the 18th was proved b±+ onei of,the letters and by the testimony of Mr. Miller. As to Mtss Perry, she did not,recollect the date of his- 4rst illness the first, the second, or even thp third -time 5lWa9Jw5o.gnosced, aud it was only by theaspost imrpr~ltoseof one of the Fiscal's clerks,. who redtohraat n of -a book whichi has been rejeeted.aswo tl i fxngates that she fixed upon the .19th. -Bn ' supsetejthw4 date, notwithstanding that the -prosecaLtor had gmrc~' Q the dru'ggists' shops in Glasgow they* bad bDeen isnssble to find that the prisoner bOught anY aracunic at all.till theftst, whenx she went so openly into Murdech'g, sigmed:h6r nemin'e, and let it go to her father's account.' He:,'lce. his iearndd friend to choone one or other of the horns, of tbis.'dilemmov -either that the deceasd was ill from the -G&icts Of' arseie on the frat occasion, in wIaichcas~ it xustshar~e beeni administered by ot-her hands ;'or that he was ill. froni some otherctause -a fact which destroyed the whole theor,y and foundation-of the prosecutores case. As to the second ill- ea,thee was no proof whatever that the. parties met ater hi purcase at all. Mrs. Jenkins said she d'd not t ik LAgelier was out of the house -on Sunaday nighttthe 22d. She said she had not given him :the. Iitoobltey-that night, which she always did when he was to be out late; that she shoiuld have recolle*tcd i~ -had he borgowed it that nigltt; and AL Thua= said he certainilydid riot I led sb in that night, which was the only' way he could get in if he left witboutt -the latchkey. Letter 10, however, was fossidec uonto prove they met .that night ; a letter which haod no date-and which, though it lizd been fotind in an envelope with the clearest date, it would be mnidness fo convict upon; and with all the possibilities of such a letter finding its way into a wrong entvelope, eveni in thv0iandi of deeeased, and still more in the hands of those by. whonm it was recovered, and with tha date quite illegible, and which the Crown witness said had an 'Ir" i,th0o nionth, which showed it could not be I 'eb.`-so that even th& Crown discarded their own witness to carry out their theory-he was entitled to say that there was not mnerely -a c-onffict of evidence on the point, but art accumulaktion df evidence dispoving th o theory that they meot that night at all; and the failure to prove that certainly putairend to the charge. If, then, deceased was HI -from arsenical polson on that occasion, the inference he again drew was thati he was in the way of receiving arsenio from spmne other hanid. The Dean then proceeded to considor the third and last charge. He referred] to the misqsing letter deceased received from the prisonter at Bridge of Allan on Ertday. Th1at letter evidently contained an appointment f6r a certain night, and when he found he could not keep it he knesv it-was uselesg to come without a special aLppoitinmenit, le then came to the second letter forwarded to Bridge of Allan, bearin the postmnark 21st March, and, as he held,' makting thel appointment for the Saturday evening. When was it she waited and waited ? Thursday evening. The letter from the deceased to Miss Perry conclusively proved thiat. When was it likely she would write her next summrons? -I should think the next evening, for she almost inivariably wrote In the evening, and when she did, not wirite in the eveniing she mentioned the hour of the day.-' This all-finportant letter was written, therefore, on the Friday ei'ening, 'and posted on Saturday maorning, addressad to7 Mrs. Jenkins; andi appointing the meeting for the Satturday evening.' It was written with the samie notice which she usually gave him of their appointments, and she believed him to be in Glasgow. There is no appearance thrcnulhout the corresiohilenco of any meeting having taken place without previous8arrangements being made, and she had constantly repeated her warning against his making any signal at-the wind dw, as it was xure to lead to discovery and risk of variou8 kinds. On every occasion she watched and waited for him; he never came without preconcert. Having broken isappointmnent for the Thursday, hoeif ver supposed he couald procure an appointment for the Friday. 116 waited4 till he got another letter, and when he broke his appointment on the Saturday why s?hould ho expect to ha've one ~on the Sunday ? On thLe Sunday night the family a-re at prayers, the servants come down stairs aud go-to bed one by dne, the cook not retiring till 11. The prisoVer ana her ybungest sister descend to thei bedroorm between half-past 10~and IL. They take half an houir to tndress. The prisoner goe-s to bed with her sister, and, so fag as human evidence gpes, the house is undisturbed and unapj,roaehed u'p to the following morning. Do yon think there could have been a meeting and no evidence of it? The poliCeman who'knew Wmn han not seen him that night; and you must remaember this i's not a bustling part of the town, Dbu a quietwest-end1square, about which the appearance of a sti anger at a late hour on~ Sunday would be sure to attract attention.. Xeithe,~ within the house nor without the liouse is there the slightest vestige or ground of suspicion that the si~eeting appoi4ted for Satuirday took place on Sunday. Then, as to L'Angeer it is said he came to the house to see thepioe nSna night. Even if that were a reanblasupto,t would not advance the prosecutrscs n hp u the supposition was not a reasnbeoh-ospose thathoi came that ditnet epa etn hc ad been appointed foraohreeigWedntknw ht other letters'he ma hmercieutBrdeo la,ad in one of his ownhesy," aercienoete fm Mr. Mitchell, sand sol iet know wha hwnt with me."1 The Crown has not told us who M.~ice is, and. I do not know. Who can tell taih eevdn other letters at Bridge of Allan, andfowhtprsee camne to unexpeetedly home? IlAngcliercmtolagw and there is also considerable myster honoe i identity in the course of the jourxe,y. osa did not describe a person lie the prisoner, and Rtoss was not shown thae photograph. The mail guard professed to indeatify him froni it, and yet the Crown objected to our relying on the photograph when identified by the druggists. No: one is called from the inn to identify L'Angelier; and whsat was the account the supposed IlAngelier gAve of himself to Ross? Wliy, that he had come from Alloa, and that he was going to Glasgow to cash a cheek, of which paymient had been refused to him as a stranger-an account which, if given by L'Augelier, the Crown had taken no means to test or account for. HIf IAngelier was not with Ross he gives no false account of himself, and the evidence of the drgit at Coatbridge, Bailleston, and Gallowgate, from whomg hte bought laudanum, who all identify the likieness, and one of them the purse out of which the money was paid, 'were consistent with each othe'r. If these three witnesse were correct he was il; and finallyinx Miss Kirk's sho he purchased a white powder, and Miss Kirk can't tell you1( what thifs white powder was. He comes to his lodging-he goes out at 9-is seen in different streets, but not in Blythswood-square; so that this proves nothing at all. He calls on M'Alester. Why is Ml'Alester not here, that he might, pferance, tell what brought hima to Glasgow, and if he know anything of Mr. Mitchell? From half-past 9 -to halfpast 2 he is absolutely lost sight of, and the Lord Advocate admitted that the fact that prisoner and deceased met that night is founded on inference and conjecture. Good Heavens, inference and conjecture I Infrenace and conjecture whether on the night he was poisoned he saw the prisoner who is charged with this murder I I never heard such expressions made use of in a capital case before as indicating or describing a link in the chain of a prosecutor's case. Ihbave heard them many a timae in the mouith of a prisoner's counsel, and I dare say Ion will hea-r more of themi from me to-day, but for the prosecutor himself to describe such a part of his evidence as a piece of conjecture and hypothesis is to me a most startling novelty. And yet mny learned friend could not help himiself. It was a necessity he should so express himaself ; forif he intended to asi a. verdict at all, -he coutld askc for. the verdict he did only on a series of unfounded and incredible suspicions and hypotheses. The Dean then referred to the statenuents as to L'Angelier having a suspicion on his maind that he had received poison from the prisoner, and said, if that were true, they were asked to believe that he took the poisoned cup from the prisoner, in which there lurked so great a quantity of arsnic as was sufficient to leave on his stomach 88 grains, and from the hands of one whomn he enspected had been practising on his life. It was a dose which. according to Dr. Christison, might have amounted to 240 grains . it was a dose that, so far as experience went, niever was before successfully administered by a miurderer, and it was most difficult to conceive a vehicle in which so great a qantity could be administered, far less to one who had hadhi suspicions previously excited. Then the Crown had shown that the colouring matter of any. arsenic cotuld afterwards he found in the stomach, bat their 'witnesses say their attention was not called to that circumstance. Whose fault was that? The Crown must ha-ve known the importance of this inquiry, And the prisoner had no mneans of being represented in this chymical analysis. Sach was the evidence of the last charge. 1f the case is a failure onL the first and second charges, it is a far-nore complete and-radical failure in the last. In faut, I have demonstrated that it was atsolately impossible to bring gnuit against the prisoner. Iteremains not only not proved, but the whole evidence connected with the proceedings of that day seems to go to negatiue such a supposition.. I miight stop there, for nothing danrt more fallacious than to suppose that it is for me to exp4i how the prisonric camne by his death. His Lordship wiil~ tell you a6 defender in this court has no furte dtbutosadon the defensive, and maintain that th aefo h*roseention is not proved. No man lvn rb cane ow L'Angelier came by his death;- no aIuneth'slightest obligationi even to suxggest to y'ou a possil manner in which his death may have been compassed w tithout he at,the hands ot tho prisoner. But it is but fair that when dealitg with matters of sIspicion and conjeeture you: should consider whether the suppositions on which this charge is founded are preferable in respect of higher probability to other suppositions that may be fairly made. The oharacter of this man-his origin, his previous! history, the nature of his conversation, the numerous occasions upon which hespoke of suicide-naturally suggest that as one mode by which he may have departed this life. I am not undertaking to prove that he died by his own band. If I were doing anything so rash I should be imitating the rashness of the prosecutor, bat I should not be stepping a hair'sbreadth further out of the beaten track of evidence and proof and demonstration; for I think there is more to be said for suicide than for the prisoner's guilt. From the very first tmne at which we see him, even as a lad, in the Year 1843 he talks in a manner to impress peo'ple with tho notion that he has no moral principle to guide him. He acake over and over again in Edinburgh, Dunadee, and elewhere-aye, and the prisoner's letteri show that he had made the same threat to her-that he would put himself out of existence. And is it half as violent a supposition as the supposition of this foul murder that upon this evening-the 22d of March-in a fit of that kind of madness which he himself described came over him whenhe met with a disappointment-finding, it may be, that he could not procure access to an interview which he desired-assuming that he came to Glasgow for the purpose-assuming, even, that he mistook the eveniDg of the meeting, and expecting to see her on the Sunday-can anything be. more probable than that in sach a case, in the excited state in which he then was, that he should have committed the rash act which put an end to bis existence? I can see no great improba. bility in that. Bar whether he met his death by suicide, or whether he met his death by aceident, or in what wty soever he met his death, the question for you is, Is thisimurder proved? You are asked to affirm that on your oaths-to alfirm on your oaths as a fact-that tbe arsenic vwhich was found in that man's stomach was preaented to him by the hands of the prisoner. .lsntlemen, I ih"vo .talked of the lmprobab*aose 'whiols ibelong~' to. tTits story_-to this:charge., 'lint care] ,-au eanudIl1ave o;mitWtedit bbserve how bl 'UhUtuiY And cx eflrdibar,y P-crime:t IsLtW ilmP`u16&to a; ~rihtt In -the prns*s 4itlation'- I itated to TOU il/cfore ta A"piece 'of undoubted- aitpefienesd, that to oDne sinks to' atiehai depth iof deprairity allat. onoe; -and now I .a.e yu toremmber at -what p4riOd. -*e'kfr'his 4orre'5l~dene-ata- erid When. sliteidesired to: IkLC *H.f witk I~Ane1ie,no oubtAt a eriDd when sb~e eiridto obtaiLa ~oseasonof erIeter, tertur o wbiekL wii refus"d upon the characte ofamiiwh ds o ebs witlVBnt )# tare to yourselves the moral tcinperablict, 'theL tate, t4.iteeling of a human being who, havnk-r,woeived~ such kettir., fromna giyl as you hvaveiard read in this curt, ;obta eper pireserve them.

But I bave now -to request Yo6ur attention to onie particular point in connexioni with -thig decla-ration-the diFferent.purchases of arsenic. The rpos. session of this arsenic is said t-o be uflaccounted -for, as far as the prisoner herself is concerned. It maay be so, and yet that would not make a case for the prosecution. She says she used it as a cosmetic. This mightbhe startling at first sgtto mn of us here, hut after the evidence we have hadit w not in the least amaze you. At achool her statement, which has been so far borne out by evidence; shows that she had read of the Styrian peasants ilng arseric for the strengthening of! their 'wind and the improvement of their complexionis.' No doubt they used it internally, and -not externaly as she did; but in the imperfect state of her knowledge that fact was of no sig1nificane. L'Angelier statedlto more than oneowitness--and if he stated falsely it is only one of a mult-ituLde of lies proved againit him-that heusQflithinslf, and itisnot surprising tha't if he (L'Augelier) knew of this custom that he should have communicated it to the prisoner. There is no reason. to suppose that if used externally, as the prisoner says she did use it, it would be productive' of any injurious effects;so that there was no reason to suspect on that ground the, truth of the statemnent that the prisoner had made. No doubt we have medical gentlemen curing here and shakdug their heads and looking wise, and s4ying that such a use ; arsenic would be a dangerous procedure. Well so should we all say that it is bothi a danagerous and foolish prcdure. But that is not the question. The 9leto swehr the prisoner couldl actually so use twithotijrosefcs and that she could do so is demosrtd yteePeri mnent of Dr. Laurie and by the oiino r algn Gentlemen, miy learned friend theLrdAvatsidht great as was thne couarage that teuhpypioe displayed when char; ed with the crie htdmaorWas not inconsistentwihteterofhrgl.Hesd that a woman who hanevtocmith murder would hmve nerve calmly to methacutin. I doubt that hypothesis. Gentlemnen, Ikow of no cause in!which suclh undaunted courage has been displayed, fro rfirst to last, by so young a girl, confronted with such a chkarge, where tha tgkir was guilty. But, gentlemen, our experience does furnishi us with examples of as grave a bearing in so young a girl when innocent. 'Do you know the story of Eliza Fenwvick ? She was a servant-girl in London. She was tried on the charge of poisoning her master and family by putting arsenic into dumaplings. When the charge was frirt made she met it with a calm and indignant denial; she maintained the same demneanour throughout a long trial ; and ihe received senteace of death without moving a muscle. According to the bsttement of a bystander, wbenbrought upon the scaffold to die, she looked serene as anx angel, and she died as she had borne herself throughout the previous stages of her sad tragediy. It was an execution which attractedl much attention at the time. Opinion was much divided as to the propriety of the verdict, and the angry disputants wrangled even over her grave. But time brought the liglit which was wanting bfore' the true perpetrator of the murder confessed ork his death 6ed-too late to avoid the enacting of a most bloody tragedy. That 'case, gentlemnen, is n3ow matter of hlis tory. It happened at a time beyonid the recollection of most of the gentlemen -whom I niow address - but it is on record-a flaming beacon to warn us againsi the sunken - rocks - of that presumptuous Arrogance, -And, , opinionated self-reliance hidden in the cold and proud human heart; it teaches us, by terrible example, to - avoid confounding suspicion with proof, andl to reject conjectures and hints when tendered as demonstration. I fear, gentlemen, that this was not a solitary case ; either thea recollection or reading of any of us may recall similar cass were aterexeuton,thejugment was proved wrog hih ad ooeda ellw-retue t de.I ra Godtha nethe yu nr Imayinanyderebgltvo nee ean ot Jaculty, in an eloquent peroration, caUed upon tho jury not rashly to tear asunder the veil of mystery - in which Providence hsad wrapped- this case, and said, so assured did he feel of what the verdict ought to be, and so persosl an interest did he feel in the result, -that, should there be a miscarriage of justice in this case he should be able to attribute it to nothing bht his own inability to conduct the defence, and the recol. lection of this day and of this prisoner would haunt him as a dismal spectre to his grave. May, he said, the spirit of all truth gaide you to an honest, just, and true verdict ! but I pray you to remember that no verdict will be either honest or just or true unlees it at once. satis. fies the conscientious scruples of the severest judgment, and yet leaves undisturbed and unvexed the tenderest con. sciencies among you. A burst of applause followed the conclusion of the learned (onunsels speech. The LonD JluSmE CLEPx then charged the jury. He said that the crime of murder by poisoning was one almost always secretly committed, and two cases only, he believed, had been known in this country in which any one had seen the admixture or the administration of the poison. It was a crime which generally must be proved by circumstantial evidence alone, but they nmust on the other hand take care tlat the cixocumstantial evidence was such as excluded the possibility either of innocence on the one hand,, or o unexplained mystery on the other, and they mnst not allow any defect in the evidence to be supplied by suspicion, still less by presumptions arising from any prohabiEties in the. case. They must be satisfied that the parties were together when the poison was said to be administered. tEhey maust be satisfied that there was a purpose to adminisAer poison. and that the accused had the poison In her possession; and, further, that it was administered oxnOe particular occ3sion and in the circumstances set forth-in the indictment. It was unnecessary for the prisoner's -comsel so solemnly to abjure them not to quench a dovb- i31 qm)er to Hrrive at * verdict of guilty,, kor hz. jra3suze that if the result of their deliboeratiors tRhogl'be to pronounce a vesdict of gaQl*, it~ would- maly ibe'wrung from thesu by' the most powerful *nd conclsie evidence. Though they migh aot. be- satisied wit& any of the theories propounded in eialf of t e -prisoner, though they might not bo inclined. to adopt. any. of .thoso otion as to the deceased tak1n, laudausm twice In tbe course of the journey, as to his bringin the habit of taling arEenic, or as to her usiag it as a cosineth, though AU1 tEese 3natters miglit fail ii hef de.- fence, yet the case for the prosecution might still be radilcally defective on the evidence. His Lordiship then went i Into theevidence, eomimenting on it as he proceeded. Hi zeferred to the fact that the decstsed had his first illness sopme days at least before the prisoner was proved to possess .py arsenic, and said it would not do to infer from her havy '.ignpurchased arsenic afterwards that she had itL before. rhat wouldbea terlous and violent presumption against tho prisoner indeed. In reference to lIes; Jenlcin's evidence, he referred to L'Angelier'- remark to the latter that " It -was the letter you sent me ,that brought me home." by which the suppostion as to his having come to see Mr. Mitchell was excluded. In regard to the deceased's second illness of the 22d of February,'he said that |if there was no proof (and they would see vwhat light the correspondence threw on that subject by and by) that the prisoner had the opportunity of administering arsenic, there 'was much force in the remark that the foundations of this case were shaken. His Loraship then ieznirked oD I LAngelier's repeating, even in his. last illness, that it was .bile, was of importance as showing whether or not he had any auscion of having received -anything to injure ji. ordship next adverted to the letter the -'deceased received at the Bridge of Allan, !which j*aid; "Come, beloved, and clasp me to .your heart," -. plainly implying that the former and missing letter 'made irrangements for an interview witbin the house. As to whether the deceased had gone to seek?the prisoner on the Sunday night, they would, perhaps, think j the probability was that he had done so. Whether he suc- ceeded'in finding her was another question. . Suppose that letter brought him to Glasgow, were they in a condition to s&y they'were satisfied in their consciences, as an inevitable .an&d justresuxltfrom-the evidence in the case, that they really met that night.? That was-the real point inthe case. Thatthey might have astrong moralsaspicioninthematterthat they might believe he was well able, after all their clan. destine correspondence, to obtain the means of an interview .-that a she bhad com plained of his not coming on the Thurs. day, she "waited and waited" for him not only, on the Saturday but on the Sundayevening-that might be iaLvery true. Probablytheyallthoughteo;but they weretrying a case of whichthe evidence must be satisfactory, complete, and distinct. A. jury might often safely infer certam cots from correspondence; they might safely infer that mee6iugs appointed to take place did take place, but it Ewvas forthem to say here whether, it not having been proved that he was In the house that night by any one, they could hlId that that link in the chain vas supplied by just and satisfactor3 inference. If they merely felt in their ownminds a strong suspiaion, or that the whole probabilities of the case were in favour of it, it was not enough, for if that was aU they could derivc from inference in that matter, then a link remained still wanting; the catastrophe and its alleged cause were not found together. IHis Lordship proceeded to zead further portions 'of the evidence, remarking, that whether or uot thi roseentor's case had been made out, the sere eindfeweeothe most unsatisfactory hind; but they could not from that supply any defect, if defect there existed, inthe prosecutor's proof. HIis Losmsnsrhad gone nearly half through the parole etd9en,e wkhen the court adjoured till the next morning THE VERDICT. (BY EECrIC TrELEOIAPIL) NNTH D&Y.-TiURSDAY. The intense interest manifested during the whole of the eight days this extraordinary trial has lasted was greater than ever this morning. Crowds of people outside the court who had not been successful in obtaining admission were trying every means in their power to gain an entrance into the court, and thepolice had the greateat difficulty in keeping a space clear for those ,'ho were personally engaged in thetrial. As early as 7 o'clock this moring Parliamentsquare was densely crowded, and as the hour of opening the court approached the crowd increasOd to such an extent that it was difricult to reach the top of the High-street. The court opened at 10 o'clock, but for some time previous that portion not appropriated to the public presented an extraordinary appearance. The jury entered the court shortly before 10 o'clock, and "upon their I ordraps a rival the prisonerwas placed in the dock. Her appearance was much the same as it was at the commencement of the trial. There was, how'ever, a slight shade of sadness in her expression, but no trace of that anxiety and deep mental suffering to be expected in a woman charged with such a dreadful cerme and with her life in such imminent danger. :During the continuance of the summing up to day, notwithstanding the strong remarks of the Lord Advocate with reference to the damaging points in 'the evidence against the prisoner, she presented that coolness and indifference she has aU alonjg exhibited in a most remarkable and extraordinary manner. The Lord Justice Clerk, in a very audible voice, commenced his summing up, and, having called to the recollection of the jury the point at which the Court adjourned last, proceeded to read and conment upon the whole of the evidence adduced botb on the part of the Crown and for the defence. He, In conclusion, earnestly impressed on the jury the importance of their fully considering all they had heard, and said that the case now only awaited their 'verdict. 'Unless they thought that clear convictioc was brought to their minds it would be their duty to acquit her. They were not to proceed upon suspicion, or even strong suspicion, but there must be strong conviction in their minds; anid if there was any reasonable doubt it was their duty to give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt; but if they came to that clear conclusion of her -guilt they were not to allow any suggestion made for the defence to deter them from doing their duty. The learned judge, having reminded the jury of the oath they had taken, concluded by beseeching an All-wise and All-seeing Providence to direct them to a right verdict. The jury then retired to their room The appearance of the court at this particular moment it is impossible to describe, many of the spectators being moved to tears by the impressive and earnest address of the learned judge. In Scotland when a jury have agreed upon their verdict a small bell is rung. Upon this signal being given the most breathless silence prevailed, and in a short time afterwards the jury reappeared in court. when The Clerk of the Court, addressing the jury, said -5C Gentlemen, have yotu agreed to yonr verdict ?" The Foreman, in a firm tone-" We have." The Clerk of the Court.-How say you, gentlemen; do you find the prisoner guilty, or not guilty ? The Foreman.-We find the prisoner " NOT -GUILTY" on the first count, And "NOT PROVEN" on the second and third. A loud and long continued burst of applause followed the announcement of the verdict, but waC -immediately suppremsed. - During the awful moments between the return of the jury into court and the giving of their verdict the prisoner betrayed not the least emotion, but on its deliery she gave a heavy sigh, which appeared to give her much relief. The excitement produced outside the court when 'the verdict became known was immense.
ROYAr ITALIAN OPERA. last night the long-promised Italian version of Fra Viavolo was produced, before a crowdeA audience, with the most complete success. As the performance did not terminate till nearly midnight It is impossible to describe it at such length as would be warranted by its interest and importanceAt present we must be content to say that the opera of MM. Scribe and Auber is placed upon the stage in such a manner as to claim unqualified approval; that the exquisitely fresh and beautiful music-thanks tothe fine orchestra and chores directed by Mr. Costa-is heard to unpre. cedentedadvantage; that most of the principal characters are admirably sustained; and that Signor Ronconi's Lord Roecburg (Lord Ailcash) is one of the most diverting and original impersonations ever witnessed. The cast includes the names of Madame Bosio (Zerlina), Mademoiselle Mari, Signers Gardoni (Fra Diavolo), NereBeraldi, Ronconi, Polo. lni,Zelger,.audTagliafiaco. Thedialegue hasbeen turnedinto accompanied recitative, and several new pieces have been added by M. Auber, of the merits of which we shall speak on a fature occasion. A tarantella is very felicitously introduced in the last act, at the festivalfor the ixtended nuptials of Franoesco andaZerlina, and this wvas danced by Mademoiselle Plunket and the rest with wonderful spirit, so as to present both a novel and appropriate feature. The entire performance was listened to with mequivocal satisfaction, and the principal singers were recallea at the termination of each of the three acts. Indeed, FraDiavoto, which had alreadydelighted thousands in a German and an English dress-to say nothing of its original costume-and which bad enjoyed for a quarter of a century a popularity Furpassed by that of no other comic opera, except the incomparable Barbiere of Rossini, may be said to have been once more naturalized.

AMERICA. SOUTHAMPON, JUrL 9. The United States' ma steamer Fulton, Captain J. A. Wotton, arrived in Cowes-roads this morniing, at 10 o'clock, with the mails and Advices from New York to the 27th ult., being three days later than those to hand previously. She left New- York at 12 o'clock at noon on the 27th, making the passage (mean time) in 11 days 1 hours and a-half. The Fulton has 26 passengers for England, and 120 for Havre, whence she proceeded: to-day, after disembarking her English mails, &c., for Southampton. On freight she brings $l53,162'for England, and $479,000 for France. On the 27th of June, 46 miles west of Sandy Eook, the Fulton passed a three-masted screw steamer, rteering to the westward, supposed to be the Jason, from Southampton; and the same day she passedi the ship Devonshire going into New York. b teIegrarhicdespatch, received at New Yorkjust before the Wuton sailedL says.- "The steamer Montreal was burnt yesterday near (uelbec.

A despatch from Boston, dated the 25th nit., says " The New Hampshiro LegislAturo to-day passed resolue tions denunciatory of the Dred Scott deision, aud in the Houso this afternoon the Negro Disability Clause was expunged from the Mitia Bill." General Cass was to leave Detroit for Washinoton on the evening of the 25th to resume his ofcial duties. 'The General had recently declined a complimentary dinner tendered him by his fellowcitizens at Detroit. The Republicans of Mssachusetts had met in State Convention, and nominated N. P. Banks and Oliver Warner as candidates for Governor and Lieutenant-Governor. The Republicans of Maine had also met in State Convention and nominated Lot M. Morrill, of Bangor, as their candidate for Governor. Two hundred and fifty United States' troops were eo leave New York on the 29th ult. for Utah, to join other troops sent from other sub-stations throughout the country, all of which would form three regiments, two of infantry and one of cavalry, numberng about 2,500 men. They are to rendezvous at Leavenworth, Kansas, where they will be placed -under the command of the new Governor of Utah. The DYew York Herald says, "The troops are generally new recruits, and are not very fine specimens of manly vigour ;" and the editor naively asks, " Woulditnotbe a good idea for the Government to send out an army of good-looking young bachelors, who would rid the Mormons of their superfluous wives, and then convert Utah into a civilized and populous community T' The sales of cotton at New York on the 26th were checked by the high views of holders, and were confined to about 500 or 600 bales, based upon middling uplands at 14gc., and New Orleans ditto, at 14gc. Flour was in fair *demand for the domeatic and export trade, without further change of moment in prices, while the market closed with less anixna. tion. Wheat was firmer, with sales of Souithern Indiana white at $1 90c.; choioe Canadian' ditto, at $1 94c.; Bllwaukie club, at $1 56c. Corn was alEo firmer, with sales of mixed Western at 90c. and 92c.; and Southern yellow, at 93c. Pork opened with small sales, at $21 25c. to $21 50c., and 1,000 thin sold, payable on Monday, at the latter figure. At the close there were no Eellers in largelots under $21 87Zc. Coffee was firn, with moderate sales. Sugars were sold to the extent of 325 hhds. Cuba muscovadoes in lots, a good part refining. There was more freight offering, aid among the engagements were 325 hhds. of augar to Liverpool, at 7s. 6d., and 1,000 ditto to iLondon, at 17s. 6d. To Liverpool grain and resn were also taken at 24d. in bulk for the former, and 6d. for the latter. The feeling and the movement of the stock-market on the 26th ult. were various-a decline being realized in some securities, an advance in others. Generally speaking the Western roads were not sustained. There was a decline of i- in Michigan Southern, but an advance of to in Cleveland and Toledo, a decline of J in btlinols Central, an improvement of i in Reading; a decline of to i in Erie, an improvement of i in New York Central; a decline of 1 per cent. in Milwaukie and Misissippi, and sO on throughout the lst according as this or that stockwas pressed for sale. A sale was noted of Illinois Central for cash at 126i, and Feller 30 days for 123being at the rate of S4 per cent. per month. New York Central, which rallied feebly on the previous day, was closely pressed by the bears, and each successive day brings more cash stock into the market. There was very little doing in the bond-market; a few smaU lots of Virginia Sixes were sold at 92i to 92i. At the second board the market was very weak, and most stocks closed at lower prices. New York Central Railroad fell off J per cent. ; Erie, i; Milwaukie and Mississippi, 3; La Croase and Milwaukie, 3; Illinois Central, 1; Michigan Southern, ,; ditto, preferzed, 1; Cleveland and Toledo, J. After the board Milwaukie and Mississippi was offered at 45 per cent. cash, without finding buyers. A large lot was offered at 40, seller 20 days, and no takers There were strong indications in the street of another panic among holders of railroad stocks. The complexion of the money-market was not at all satisfactory. The demand was more active, and the rates tended upward. (BY E,EcC MAND INTEBNATIoxAL TszoGr.AH) LIVERPOOL, JULY 9.

GuATNO.-KOORIA JaOORIA BAY ISLA#DSs. TO THEE EDITOR OF THE TiMES. Sir,-After an absence of some years I have just teturnecl from Austhnlia, and find that the subject of the deposits en the above ilands have become a matter of public Ina terest. As regards one of the islands, Jibleea, I can speak fronm perhaps greater experience than any one that has yet visited' that place, and therefore hasten to givo aU the information I possess, so as to put the aeair in lts'trae light. In the year 1852 r accompanied Captain Ord -on a voyage to the East Indies as chief officer of the Margaret. in November that year we made Kooria Mooria Bay, and Cap. tain Ord, after landing, having discovered there wFere de. posits of guano, suggested that I should romain ain the Island of Jibleea to explore it, and he would call for me on his return. I oonsented to do so, taking two siMp's apprentices for company, also being well armed and provlsioned. I do not remember the exast dates, but in the month of November I landed sud remained therep occasionaly anxious about my return, until the latter end of the February foUowing, when I took my departure in a bugalow, despatched by Captain Ord from Bombay. I remained at Bombay some two months while Captain Ond ws endeavouring to organize an expedition for the purpose of shipping the guano; but, finding he was not.likely to succeed, I returned to England in the Araminta, and after staying at home three months made a voyage in the shipPersia to Melbourne, where I remained until my returxz home in the Donald M'Kay about five weetks since. * Accidentally I saw a paragraph in The Timer-of the 2a inst. respecting these islauds, and it then ocourredto m- the information I possemed might be of some ivlne. The weather during the three months and three day3 I remained there was exceedingly. warm, and one or twoa showers of rain fell, but of so slight a nature that there was no appearance of wet a few seconds after they had fallen; the wind varied from north to east-north-east, generaly3 very light and in no case exceeding a breeze in which a vessel could ride with aUl security at an anchor., From half a mile to a mile the anchorage is eceedingij safe, the bottom being composed of gravel, with large stones; close in it would not be advisable for vessels to 'lie, but in all cases stages for loading can bo readily erected, ,and need' not exceed at the most 50 feet; inl many instances only 1G feet would be required, at some places the guano can be shot from therocks direct into the boats. The whole of my time ws occupied in exploring the island, and from the result of a mlnute exanination I am satisfied the quantity of guano there will ptovo vero large. A casul observer would pass unnoticed many spots (which sound quite hollow) where the deposits are to a considerable extent covered by a crust (which I am told is composed of phosphate of lime) of the depth of four to eight inches, which, in my opinion, is sufficient to protect the gansn below from any rain that falls there. On turning this crust over I found a deposit of dark browiZ guano, varying from three to six feet, all full of ammonia; under which there appeared a white deposit the nature of' which I do not know. Three plains-one about 500 yarda long by 200 to 300 yards wide, another 200 to 300 yards long. snd the same in breath, the third, near the beach about 400 yards long by 50 broad-were all covered with guanowhich appeared to me ot good quality. I also noticed that from some cause-the reason of whichl I cannot explain, whether the heat of the sun or not I don't know-but frequently about noon the stones, many four ta f.ve tons weight, and pieces of rock on the hilas -were split and scattered to the extent of some 50 yards by small ex* plosions, and the small pieoes so dispersed fell upon the plains of guano, which were covered by them, so as to resemble a macadamized road; but they do not exten4 materially below the surface. The hiUs also, as well as the plains, are eovered with deposits toa greater or a less extent; but, as I had only my utlass to sound, I could not tstimato the depth at morn than about four feet; but I have every reason tj believe it is considerabty deeper; in fact, it would not surprise me i£ the greater portion of these hiUs ar solid masses of guano. But I attach greater importance, as regards quality at east, to the deposits in the caves. These are very choice, being well protocted from alI weather; but here again, unless examined minutely, thesce eaves would be passed unnoticed. Ionly discovered them by Watching the birds; and it. may be well to name that theto birds resort ia innumnic rable quantities, being atAtcd'.by the abundance of fisl round the islands, and remainifigthereundisturbed. I explored at least 40 of these caves. I thinkthe number exceeded this, but I wish to be Within the fact; Many of them open out from one tothe other, and each vll contain large quantites, being so full that I Was eompelled to creep in on aS and Lknees. 1 have no doubt ibere willbo many snore, but without assistauce I could not explote further. The hatmmonia is very strongs and there are no stones mied with this. In conclusion, I have no doubt the other two idands have a corresponding quantity, as there were many birds there, but this is only suruce, and I wish to *peak only of what I saw,; and I am sure the result will b'ear out the reot I Ilam, Sir, your obedient servant. r.A, *TAXBflRy* I uvepoo11 Jil S.
