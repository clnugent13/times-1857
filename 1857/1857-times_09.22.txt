MONKY-MABETa,d CIT YNTELLIGBro.a. Monday Evening. The funds rernain without alteration, and the business transacted ir, altogether unimportant. Consolo for money again opened at 90k to 1. There was then a momentary depression to 90, but the market returned to its former point, and the fiial operations w v,ere at 90i to i for money, and 90o to i for the 14th of October. There was no excessive pressure for money eitber in theStock-Exchange or discountmarket. India Stock left off at 210 to 212; India Bonds, 23s. to 17s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 8sa. to 4s. discount. The foreign stock-market has shown greater activity, but generally the highest prices are not filly maintained. Buenos Ayres have been negotiated at 83j-; Danish Five per Cents, 101 and 101k; Ecuador New Consolidated, 13t,; ditto Provisional Lar,d Warrant, 3; Grenada New Active, 21i; ditto Deferred, 52; Peruvian Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 794 and 79; Portuguese, 45 i Spanish, for the account, 401; ditto Deferred, 25a; Swedish, 83; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 041; ditto Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 99 ; Venezuela Four-and-a-Quarter per Cents., 31, 36A, and 31 ; ditto One-and-a-HaLf er Cents. Deferred, 12 ; and Dutch Four per Cent. gertificates, 100. The corn-market was very heavy this morning, at a decline of between 3s. and 4s. from the rates of Monday last. The closing quaotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 20c. for money, and 67f. 10c. for the end of the month, showing in the latter case a fractional decline. The Bank of Prussia have again raised their rate of discount. On the 21st of last month they advanced it to 5i per cent., and it has now been pub up to 6 per cent. At Hamnburg also the rate has returned to 0 per cent. The advices from New York this week indicate a conticned subsidence of the panic. A number of failures are reported, but only three or four of any consequence. These consist of Bates, Griffin, and Livermore, and Tuttle, Cutting, and Co., two houses of fair standing in the produce trade; Coffin and Haydock, an old auction firm, and Saroni and Goodheim, clothiers. The latter is a Boston house, -with liabilities estimated at 100,0001. There had been no further bank difficulties, and if future accounts should not show a relapse the manner in which the principal establishments have passed through the crisis in the face of the attacks made upon them wil be creditable alike to the bankers and merchants. It was alleged that upon further investigation the affairs of the recently suspended Ohio Life and Trust Company seemed to present a better prospect than had been anticipated. The rate for the best paper still ranged from 12 to 18 per cent., and as the banks were compelled to maintain their late sudden contraction the stock-market had experienced a further reaction from its momentary rebound. Erie Railway was quoted 21i, Reading 50, Nzw York Central 72, Michigan Southern 23 to i, Panama, 83, and Illinois Central 96, the Bonds 88. The report of Captain Galton to the Board of Trade on the Railways of the IJnited Kingdom for 18506 has just been issued, and is a very clear and satisfactory document, calculated, on the -whole, to strengthen the hope that, with improved management, the recovery in the value of this description of property will be steady and continuous, although it must be slow. Notwithstanding that the preferential and loan capital constituted 43 per cent. of tho whole of the railway capital raised to the end of 18565, and that the interest payable on this, n-oing to the state of the money-market, was higher than during any former period, the percentage having beeu 5.08 againt an average of 4.72 for the preceding seven years, the average rate of dividend available for the ordinary sbare capital was 3.12 per cent., being equal to that of 1855, and considerably higher than the average of the preceding seven years, which was 2.59. In 1854, however, the rate was as high as 3.39. Of the total 308,775,8941. now embarked in railways, 77,359,4191. has been raised by loans, 57,057,1711. by preference shares, and 174,359,3041. by ordinary share capital. This represents an expenditure of 35,4591. per mile, the cost of the English lines having been 40,2881. per mile, of the Scotch 27,7501., and of the Irish 14,8081. The period of extravagant outlay, however, was prior to 1849, the average cost of lines constructed since that period having been only 9,5081. per mile. The worliing epenses Last year experienced an increase r of 1 per cent, in England, and a diminution of 2 per cent, in Scotland and Ireland, the average being 47 per cent. as compared with 48 per cent. in 1855. The development of the goods traflic has gone on upon a rapid ratio, and its pro. portion to the passenger traflic is now 53 to 47 per cent., whereas eight years ago it was only 44 to 56 per cent. The total of passengers conveyed in 1856 was 129,347,592, being an increase of 10,752,457 on the prenvious year; and the number conveyed per mile of railway open was 15,213 against 14,503 in 1855, the receipt* per mile Ibeing ,1'41. against 1,1641.. Only one traveller in 10G,168,449 has been killed, and onein458,370 injured, showing a degree of safety greater thaa inany I year since 1351. The general effects of the raising or lowering of fares are detailed and the result appears to be against the! policy of high charges. The length of lhre open for t-affic in the united kingdom on the 30th of June, 1856, was 8,506 miles, and the persons employed amounted to 10,117, or 12 per mile. There were also 963 miles in course of construction at that period, of which albout 208 wvere opened before the end of the year. The wvhole are double lines, excepting 2,511 miles. Between i4,000 and 5,000 miles authorized by Parliament remain to be constructed. The total will then be 13,173 miles-namely, 9,700 in England and WNales, 1,047 in Scotland, and 1,826 in Ireland. The number of Acts passed in the session of 1856 was 59, authorizing a length of line of 322 miles at a cost of 5,784,4261. Captain Galton refers to the delinquencies in conne-ion with the Great Northern linie, &-c., and calls the attention of the Board of Trade to the fact that shareholders will be continually liable to frauds of this nature " until a more carefuil system of audit, and one independent of thoFe directly concerned in the management of the railways, be generally adopted, and until a direct responsibility be placed on those to whom that managemient is coIIfided." In the general business of the port of London during the Past week there has been increased activitv. The total of ships reported inward was 294, sliowing an increase of 88 over the previous weekl. These included 2 with fruit, 6 with coffee, 30i with sugar, 74 with corn, &c., and 2 from Shanghlai, -with 18,234 packages of tea, and 979 bales of silk. The number of ships cleared outward was 120, including 22 in ballast, being the same as in the previous week. There are 57 vessels on the berth loading for the Australian colonies, being, 10 more than at the last account. Of those now loading 5 are for Adelaide, 3 for Geelong, 3 for Ilobart-town, 3 for Launceaton, 7 for New Zealand, 20 for Port Phillip, 1 for Portland-bay, 12 for Sydney, and 3 for Swan River. The following is from the East India Coal Company "sThe company have received by the last mail advices from their agents that they have made a contract with the Governmuent for 105,000 mands of coal, on account of which contract they have rece*ved 28,562r. They also state that the demand for coal is greatly inCreasing."
RAITI,HWAY AND MININfG SEA1RES. Monday Evening. The railway-market han been flat, andl a general indisposition to do much business ha3 prevailed. In many of the leading descriptions a decline has taken place, especially in London and North-Western, South-Western, Lancashire and Yorkshire, Sheffield, Midland, Soiuth-Eastern, and North-Eastern stocksy Canadian shares were also lower, Grand Trink receding ]l. A general improvement occurred iu French. In American, IUinois Central again declined. The only important variation in mines was an advance in East Bassett. Joint-stock banks show no alteration. In miscellaneous securities there was a recovery in Peel River Land, and a slight reduction in National Discount.
BA L WAY INTRLLIGENCE. NORTH BRITISl The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at EAdiaburgh on Friday; Mr. Hodgeon in the chair. The report, an abstract of which has lppeared in The rimt, was held as read, The OCAIRMIAS, in noVing its adc-ption, saia he thoughe it could not fail to be satisfactory to tho shareholders at large. Their rolling stock and permanent way were both in good wvorking erder; their traffic receipts had increased i inug the hall wear; their working expenses had intercst on their bonded debt was less than floating debt had to a great extent been paid offtand was in course of being paid off altogether; their dvidends were enlarged, and they anticipated a surplus capt. tal, after paying off all debts, amounting to more than 155,0U01. available for future purpose. These 'acts proved that their undertaking was once inore on a firm basis, and thbt they might now look forward to gradual and progressive Prosperity. At tho last balf-yearly meeting he mentioned circumstances in con. r exion with the mail services performed by this conmpany which proved that the unriv3lled pnctLuality of the North British Railway had been a source of satisfaction to the Postofflice and of profit to themselves. Tbey were then, and were still running on a sytem of premiums and penalties, the result of which wos that they were receiving about f 001. in premiums in addition to tho regular remuneration for carrying tlo mals. That system was, however, to be done away with, and a new agreement bad been entered into witha the Post-office for anamonnt of rent which would moro than compensate for the lows of the premiums; this agreement being terminable by either party on three yearse notice. Ee congratulated the North Bntish shareholders on the defea4 of the lawick and Carlisle Bill, as promoted by the Caledonian. That company bad threatened to reintroduee, the same measure with some amendments next sesion, but he predicted with confidenco its renewed de. feat, inusmuch as this coropany were prepared now, as they were not last year, to protect themselves by introducing a rival measure with superior advantages. It was, he thought, absolutely neoemary for their interosts that shey should promote this scheme, if they had no other reason for doisgEo than that a new route from the east to the west coast, from Doncaster to CarlWeo, 'would h3 opened in the course of a year or two, and which was under obligation to carry through traffic, whereby a large portion of the traffi originating in the east coast of Engv land would find its way to Edinburgh and other parts of Scotland through Carlisle. The Great Northern had intimated their Intention to take a portion of traffic in that direction, as they were entitled to do, and it was the duty of this comp3ny to see that their exercise of that rightdid not prejudice the interests of this line. Their Harick branch lad never been contemplated by its originators as merely a brauch line, bat its continuance south to Carlisle had all along been kept in view. The Caledonian could not comnPI= of aggression, as the traffic to be opened up by the awick and Carltsle line was not at present finding its way to them, while they wvould have every facility of access they requirod to the Canobie coalfields and the Longtown and Langholme district, it being the determination of the North British that the line, if given to them, should be free and open to all. He then adverted to the favour with which their shene was viewed by the LAncaster and Carsle the Glasgow and South-Western, the Port Carlisle, and the Silloth Railway Companies, the latter having agreed to sub. scribe 30,0001. to the scheme on the understanding that a connecting braneh of about three miles should be formed with them. tits concluded by recommending the shareholders of tho North British to take upa largeproportion of the vawick and Carlisle stock, and intimated that the deposits would be retured to the subseribors by this company in case of failure to psocue theo Act. Mr` S DOUGLASS seconded the motion for the adoption of the report, which was r,greed to. Dividends were then declared of 5 per cent, on the guaranteed and 2i per cent. per annum on the ordinary stock. The CHAIRnAuS then moved that the directors be empowered to enter into such arrangements with all parties nterested in the construetion of the North British and flawick and Carlisle Junction Railway as should best promote the carrying out of that scheme, and to mako such applications to Parliament as may be necessary. r. KrLOCIE seconded the motion, expresstng his belief that when the continuation line was made their Hawick branch, instead of paying only 161. to 201 per mile, would pay 501. ,as the line to Berwick was doing. Theresolution was unanitnonsly carred. The CnAniS.rY then moved a resolution to apply to Parliament for powvers to convert the Ldth and PortobeUo branch, now worked by her sea, into a locomotive line, and to ipropve theMunsselburg branch ,at the junction, which was also ngreed to. Trhe meeting then separated, SCOTTISH NORTH-EASTERN, The report of the directors of this company states that the receipts for the half-year ending July 31 amounted to 89,781. and the expenditure to 41,1951., leaving a balance of 45,59214 Of thIs sum the Aberdeen revenue account takes 7-10ths, or 31,914Z., and the Scottish Midland 3-lOths, or 13,6781. Deducting interes' on borrowed money, the rent payable to the Arbroath and Forfar Company, and makding up the defieiency of 9131. own lin last account, the balaDce available for dividend on Aberdeen capital stock for the half -year is 9,2291, leaving a surrplus of 9291. a£ter payment of the full dividend oa the 6 per cent, preference stock. The sum applicable as dividend on the Scottish Midland stock is 11,045t, out of which it Is proposed to pxy a dividend at the rate of 3i per cent. per annum, leavLng 261. to be carried to reserved account, w`iich now amounts to 4,95W The Midland revenue account has been debited with 5501 further to account of interest on the company's proportion of the cost of the general station at Perth, still unadjusted. Every item properly chargeable against revenue has been placed against the joint ravenue account, and in addition to 4051. charged on account of the cost of two engines building at the companty's workshops the directors have debited revenue with 1,0004, being a part of the price of the two new engines purchased during the half-yoar, Including tbese twosunis the locomotive expenses of the past half year are 1,9061 less than those for the corresponding period of last year, wvhile the cost of wrorking and repairing the carriage and waggon stock is also less by 4761. The increase of the revenue from passengers, as comnpared vwith the corresponding half-year. is :1774L. ad 9TW f- - - set horses, but there is a decrease on the sum received for malls of 9931. The goods traffic has suffered by tho increased rates imposod by the Enelsh companies, but notwithstanding the vithdrawal of a large portion of the traffic to and from London and other places, tho revenue on the 'whole has not actually decreased; and now that a year has elapsed since the alteration of the rates took place, there is good hope that the traffic will compare better from week to week with the same period of last year. The increase of revenue from goods and minerals less cartage, ac., has been 1,3101., but there has been a decrease on cattle of 8791., leaving only 43014 of net increase during the half-year. The falling off in the receipts as mileage for the use of the company's plant on foreign lines amounted to 1,319. The decreseo in the revenue from cattle traffic has been caused partly by the falling off in the number of beasts conveyed to London, but prinucially by the increased rate charged by the English companies for their conveyance by railway, and which has had the effect of divesting the traffic from the railways to the steaners. The directors have now made an arrangement which they hope will secure to the comDany a larger share of this traffic in future. The directors ave paid the 7,O000 subecription to the Perth, Almond Valley, and Methven Railway Company, and the line will be opened for trafflic early in the ensuing month. It will be worked by 1 this company under an equitable arrangement. The averace zate of interest paid on borrowed money during the haifyear has been 41. 13s.6d. per cent., as against 4L 15s. 2d. for the previons half-year, and the averago rate is being still further reduced. The rollirng stock obtained duxing the half-year consists of two goods engines, one first-class carriage, one luggage van, and seven timber waggons. A contract for 150 platform waggons to be delivered by the month of January next hazs been entered Into. The directors propose that in futuro years the dividend cn the 6 per cent. preference stock and tho other preference stocks, when entitled to receive it, be paid along with the dividend on the Scottish Midland stock, immediately after the hall-yearly meetings. The dividend on the 6 per cent. preference stock for the current half-year wlbe paidd at Martinmas as usual. The capital aecount shows that 1,323,9591. had been received on the Aberdeen capital stock, and 535,7751. on the Scottibh Midland capital stock, mnaking together 1,909,7341. The amonnt raised on loans and debenture stock amounted to 699,0.11. The company was authorized to raise 1,930,6&i. on shares, and 743,0001. on loan, together 2,673,6894 The expenditure on Aberdeen capital account to the 3Lst of July last amounted to 1,856,40SI., on Scottish midland capital aecount to 667,8991., and on joint account to 129.7591.; total, 2,654,0621. The revenue account showed that 89,738. had been received during the half-year ending the 31st of July, being at the rato of 556813d. per train mile, and the expenses 41,1951., or 27,473d. per train mile, leaving a balance of 45,5921. The balance against the Aberdeen revenue account, in respect of traffic and the 7 per cent, guaranteed dividend, amounts to 73,3031., up to the 30th of April Ilst. SELEIRK AND GALASEHE:LS. The shareholders of this line met on Wednesday; Mr. Roberts in the chair. The report stated that the expense of working the line had exceeded the estimate, and that while the estimated traffic was 3,00014 the actual amount was only 2,733b Tho increrse of the receipts, however, amounted to 9 per cent. in two nonths. It was agreed that application sbould be made to Parliament for a hill to raise 5,0001. of additional capitaL The report was adopted. A motion was made for the withdrawal of StLuday trains, which was lost by a majority of 21. INNERLEITHEN AND PEEBLES. The promoters of this project for a line down the Tweed from Peebles to Innerleithen, it appoars, have resolved, with the consent of the subscribers, to apply for an Act in the ensaing somion of Parliament. The directors of the Peebles and North British Railway havo offered to work the line. KIROSSSHIRE. The first general meeting of this company was held at Edinburgh on Friday, MIr. W. Dunlop presiding. Tne report stated that, though the capital was fixed at 53,00017., only about 24,000l. had yet been subscribed. The estimates for the construction of the main line from a point on the Dunfermline branch of the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee, near Lochgelly, to a lxint south of the town of Elnross, the length being six miles and seven furlongs, amouuted to 37,5921., and for the branch from the Orrwater to Kingeo,4, torminatUng In a jenction with the West of Fife Mineral Railway, the length being three miles and three furlongs, 15,9871. The report recommended that until the ca,pital should be more folly subscriobd, anu tho coalfieldsonthe branchlinebetter oponed up, the main line only should be at preset proceeded with, The Eginburgh, Perth, and Dnudee had agreed to work the linon eer.a t conditions wrbioh it was for this eeting to raufy, On the motion of the COn.Am bN thO zort was adopted, the working agreoment Muctioned, and . bo.4 of directors appointed.

LONDON. TUESDAY, SEPTEABER 22,1857. 'certain British inhabitants of Calcutta have addressed a Petition to Parliament founded on the present state of the Bengal Presidency. The Petition contains various representations as to the unlimted power of the Indian Government; the little that appears to have come of that power in this instance; the utter disorganization of the country; the loss of British supremacy; the ruin of trade; the absence of men, money, and credit; and the extreme miseries suffered, or still to be suffered, by the British population. In fact, the preamble of the Petition is a picture of India, and a very gloomy one. People usually, however, pass over a preamble quickly, especially when they perceive that it tells them no more than they know already. They glance over the narrative and argument, and ask what iis wanted. It may be that what is wanted is a clear impossibility, or exists already, only not in the very form desired; or, perhaps, it is a proposition of a decidedly foolish, inadequate, irrelevant, or injurious character. In that case the argument is only a reduxtio ad absuradum, and the proposed remedy being absurd the complaints are good for nothing. The Calcutta petitioners conclude with a prayer that Parliament will deprive the East India Coompany of the government of India, and substitute in the place of the Company's power the direct government of the QuamN, with an open Legislative Council. Such is the mainproposition, and it means a species of Parliament in Calcutta, openly discussing the affairs of India, preparing laws and canvassing measures, much as we do at home. As it is not every description of Parliament, certainly not one on the Westminster pattern, that would suit India, the petitioners are content that the one they ask for India shall be " suitable to the requirements of. " the country, and compatible with the British " supremacy." This argues, we think, a higher degree of resignation to the laws of human nature and a deeper sense of the difficulties of the problem than might have been anticipated. In two points, however, the petitioners are not prepared to abide by the decision of the proposed Parliament, and accordingly they annex to this legislative project what we should call "an instruction to the Committee." They aslk for QUEEN'S Courts, presided over by trained lawyers, and for English as the official Court language. It is not for us to measure the importance of these two requirements in an AngloIndian imagination, but there certainlly does seem a sort of batlos in concluding the sad story that now saddens every heart with a prayer for trained lawyers and the official use of the English language in the couts of law. What we miss in this document is the connexion between the premises and the conclusion. One does not see how the substitution of English for Persian or any other Oriental language, in any proceeding or document, would have tended to avert any of the evils described. Again, had the petitioners alleged that the natives were the victims of legal oppression, and had just cause, or even natural provocation to revolt, then it would be to the purpose to suggest the employment of better lawyers to preside over the Courts, instead of giving judicial situations to men of a general rather tban a peculiarly legal education. But the petitioners leave us to infer that the real sin of the mutiny is entirely on the side of the mutineers; that it is quite uinprovoked, and has only prospered through the excessive confidence of the Government and its reluctance to spend money on the increase of its army. So far from the argument, then, proving the necessity of either better lawyers or the use of the English language in legal proceedings, one is rather taken aback at the things being mentioned at all ; and a suspicion arises that we do not see the whole of the document, or that some powerful personages have been able to attach a "' rider" to the Petition as the condition of their support. We need not here disciss the value of these particular suggestions. It is better that a court of justice should be presided over by a lawyer, and it is better that a lawyer should be trained than not; and to an Englishman, no douabt, it is a considerable convenience to have a6l the business done in his own language, which he commonly understands much better than he does any other. But is this to the purpose ? Has the excessive use of Persian and Eindostanee, and afoolish familiarity withthe nativetongues, contributed to our errors in thepresent instance? Would our magistrates and innumerable emplo4gs have ascertained the existence or designs of the Sepoy conspiracy the sooner or better from using and knowing no language but their own? Would affairs have been better at this moment if the Judges had been more learned in the law; if they had been able to split a hair into quarters instead of halves I We don't see what the English language or the education of the lawyers au& judges has to do with the matter; aud the petitioners do not think it worth while to enlighten the English mind on this important point. The existing government of India is through a species of Board, entirely under the control of the CRowf, and little else than a department of State, which does -what can be done at this distance, while such matters as require immediate decision and arrangement are left to the Governor-General and CounciL Parliament has only just settled this plan, after considerable discussion, and certainly with no leaning to the Company. However, the fact is that at this moment the British Cabinet can do whatever it pleases, but has the valuable assistanc3 of informants and advisers with Indian experience. The anticipation and suppression of a mutiny, of course, are matters for the local Government, simply because it is on the spot, it knows what is going on, and the dangers are such as must be met instantly, if at all. To prove the utter impotence of the Government at home, of the Board of Control, or the India House, for the prevention or immediate suppression of the mutiny, it is enough to observe that news of the mutiny at Meerut and the capture of Delhi by the rebels reached this country within a few days of the massacre of Cawnpore. As, then, no alteration is called for in the home administration of Indian affairs, and any improvement must be in India, what are the particular measures proposed by the Calcutta petitioners? An open Legislative Council ; public instead of secret deliberations; probably a more numerous and various body. Such bodies we have in our colonies, where the colonists govern themselves, and where we can act upon the British principle of no taxation without representation, and other traditions of our law; but in India self-government is impossible and ridiculous. If it is intended by these gentlemen that the Legislative Council shall be elective, and as open in its constitution as in its debates, then of course, it will represent Mussulmans, Hindoos of all castes, Mahrattas, and a hundred lesser races and religions, all of whom wil have to discuss openly in the Senate questions which they wiU most probably be settling elsewhere more promptly and practically with the sword. The truth, however, is, that we hold India by military possession. The Governor-General's Council is a permanent council of war, in which are discussed, or ought to be discussed, the strength of defensive positions, possible dangers, the temper and strength of neighbours, allies, and dependents, the possible designs of traitors and foes, and the policy of the Government itself under these circumstances. Will any reasonable being say that these are matters for open discussion in the presence of the vast Indian population and a thousand intriguing pretenders? WiU anybody say that the delicate questions which have led to this mutiny would have received a safer handling had it been discussed in public, and reported in newspapers all over India? We don't think they would, and we are not surprised that these petitioners should guard and reserve the proposal of an open Council with the reaUy destructive qualification that it should be so framed as to be "suitable to the requirements of the country, and " compatible with the British supremacy."
The uncertainties and vicissitudes of war appear to meet with as complete illustration in the course of the Indian Mutinies as they could receive in the most regular and legitimate campaigns. We scarcely hear of a reverse before it is retrieved, or of a succeos before it is damped by some change of fortune. Almost as soon as General HAvEToc's triumphant advance had been announced we learnt his halt and his retreat, and the next day again brought us the intelligence that his march had been recommenced. The news of our loss in the ambuscade at Arrah was followed directly by the information that what the first expedition failed to effect had been accomplished by a second. Major EYRE, with only 200 men and three guns, moved upon Arrah from Buxar, defeated a force of 3,000 insurgents which attempted to stop his way, and succeeded in relieving the garrison. From Bombay we are hardly in possession of a satisfactory despatch when a report arrives that another instance of mutiny has occurred. It appears that a second revolt had broken out at Dharwar, some distance to the south of Kolapore, where the first symptoms of treason had been exhibited; and that application had been made to Bellary-a strong military station in the Madras Presidency-for assistance in suppressing the insurrection. Of the particular aspect or proportions which this outbreak had assumed we are not informed, but it is aflirmed that the Madras troops were thoroughly stanch, and that their effective co-operation could be depended upon. it is certainly somewhat remarkable that after the receipt of a mail comprising assurances from all quarters respecting the prospect of affairs in the Bombay Presidency we should so soon have reason to believe that the contagion had not died out with a singl3 example of disorder. We conceive, however, that the descriptions recently given of things in Bombay are substantially true, andv that the Mutinies in these parts do not represent any such organized disaffection as must long have been prevailing in Bengal. Some of the chief elements of mischief have little or no existenec in the Bombay Army. There is no recognition of caste, no pampered fanaticism setting the soldier above his work, and no vast body of troops in which a poisonous leaven can ferment. Hitherto the Bombay Sepoys have behaved with loyalty and courage, but they are Orientals still, and, what is more, they comprise a considerable number of Mabrattas. Assuming that the origin of these deplorable revolts is to be looked for in MIahomedan conspiracy, it is nevertheless probable enough that the archmiscreant NnNA SAIIIB may have communicated the impress of his private policy as well as his private barbarism to the plots of others. The Bombay Presidency, az our readers are aware, includes the principal seats of the old Mahratta Powver. It was at Sattara that the ltajah resided who represented the original dynasty of these Princes; and it was at Poonah that BAJEE RAo, the patron of NENA SAiB, kept his Court. If Nr.x~. SHniB had conceived any designs of re-establishing a Mahratta State, with himself at its head, it is to Bombay and the adjacent provinces of the MTadra3 Presidency that he would naturally turn. It is unreasonable to suppose that he could hava neglected this chance of working mischief, and it tells, in fact, rather for the fidelity of the Sepoys than otherwise that the results of his machinationi should be so few and so late. We may hope, without much presumption, that the chastisement of this villain,-though still short of its due proportions, -the summary rout of his band, and the destruction of his castle may not be without influence on the Mahrattas whom he has attempted to delude. Independently, however, of any evil which could be wrought by NENA SAHIB, it is impossible to shut our eyes to the effect which the example of revolt and the spectacle of anarchy may produce upon Oriental minds. We suppose the Bombay Sepoys are troops of at least average fidelity to their employers-in fact, the features of the case show as much; for if they had been prone to disaiEection or open readily to corruption, it is clear that we should have heard of their treason some time ago. They were, no doubt, well enough disposed to render their masters good military service, and, except for the solicitations of others and the inducements of a crisis like the present, would probably have remained faithful to their colours against any ordinary temptations. We have seen, in fact, that the fir3t mutiny-that of the 27th Native Infantry at Kolapore-involved only a portion of the regiment; that the loyal Sepoys acted against the mutineers, that the revolters were soon compelled to disperse themselves, and that they did not find much safety in flight. It is probable enough that the second example of revolt may be mitigated in its aspect by similar circumstances, but the epidemic has at last unfortunately manifested itself in the Presidency, though in a form less virulent than was seen in Bengal. There are no longer clean bills of health from Bombay. There is one circumstance, however, to which we now especially wish to bespeak attention, and that i the extraordinary effect produced by the arrival of even the snallest reinforcements of British troops. The opportune disembarcation of a single regiment-the 33d-at Bombay actually appears to have communicated an entirely new aspect to affairs. The European community gained I animmediate accessionof satisfaction andconfidence, and the despatch of a company or two in directions judiciously chosen would go far, it was thought, t to check any spirit of insurrection which might b be displayed. This fact is ample evidence of what timely succours, however small, may be expected to accomplish; and it is, indeed, one of the most remarkable features of this whole struggle that we go to work with numbers so disproportionately adapted to the general character of the scene. India contains upwards of 150,090,000 of people, and among them more than 200,000 men who have by our own instrumentality been disciplined and equipped for the purposes of war. It was one of our chief errors of policy that we never maintained a sufficient European force to keep this mass in order; but we are now plunging into what may be termed a hostile country with armies which, if numbers alone gave military strength, might expect to be swallowed up in a week or two after landing. Even at the head-quarters of our force -the Camp before Delhi-we had not at the latest dates above 2,500 British soldiers ; General lE.vALocK started to fight through a province in rebellion with less than 1,500; the arrival of about the same number at Calcutta set the capital of India rejoicing, and a battalion comprising, perhaps, 700 or 800 bayonets suffices for the I reassurance of Bombay. If 10,000 British troops were but united under some one capable General, there is probably nothing which they would not attempt or accomplish. But these considerations, if they are calculated to maintain our reputation and insure our success, ought to quicken and stimulate our effor!s in the despatch of reinforcements. At first sight it might seem reasonable enough to smile at any urgency in forwarding 500 men for the rescue or recovery of an immense Indian territory, but we see by actual experiment that 500 men may indeed achieve no less success. A detachment taken cut by a mail steamer may turn the scale at a critical moment, for in an open field a few companies of British troops appear capable of anytbing. We rejoice, therefore, to observe that arrangements have been made for turning to good purpose the carrying capacities of our mail ships, and that our forces in India are to receive small but regular accessions of strength through these means. The very knowledge that these reinforcements may be anticipated at stated times would control the spirit of revolt, and conduce most materially to the security of Government; and as Bombay is the nearest and most accessible port, as well as the smallest and most controllable Presidency, we trulst the arrival of a few detachments in succession to the 33d may repeat the admirable services -which that regiment appears to have rendered.
The War-office and the Horse Guards have need now of all their wits, and of the quickest use of them. The pressing question is no'. any new general and permanent military arrangement, but how to get the soldiers we want for India. We have already published various letters on this subject, and we are receiving numbers daily. The writers aU take one line-that of the " YoUNG ENariSH3rAN" whose letter appeared in our columns the other day. They ask how they are to get admission into the army now colecting for India. They are of a Tank which would not permit them to enlist as common soldiers, and they have neither means nor interest enougk to get commissions. They suggest the formation of volunteer corps, service for a limited period, and promotion from the ranks according to merit. Any fonn of service which would be consistent with their rank as gentlemen, and would give them a fair prospect of distinction, would suit them. They would be quite content with any kind of admission into the army which woould not socially degrade them. Our correspondents, we have no doubt, represent a large class. We have reason to believe that the Horse Guards is flooded with letters from young men offering their services, and anxious to have them accepted on these conditions. The spirit of the country is up, as, indeed, it ought to be. Everything has been done that could be done by an enemy to rouse it. We believe there are thousands of young men of the mriddle classes now in this country to whom it would be the -reatest pleasure to go out and fight these mutineers. We felt the importance of the Russian war as politicians, but this -war comes nearer home to us and enhlsts every natural feeling we have. In this state of the case it would be the greatest pity if some way or other was not found of making use of these uroffered services. We believe, as we have just said, that there is at this moment a prodigious amount of enthusiasm in the country, and the only question is by what channel it is to be brought into employment. The plan of volunteer corps is suggested, and we seo no strong reasons, for our part, against such an experiment. It is the very experiment which we made thle other day,-only applied in the case of foreigners, and made too late to be of any use. But whatever objections may be raised against this or that plan, some plan or other there should be for making use of the offered strength of the country, and the War Department wviU asiume great responsibility if it does not strike while the iron is hot. There may be some good reasons why we are called an unmilitary nation; but the term, even if true of the nation generally,-and it can be true in that sgeneral application only in a very limited sense, for the whole world allows that we fight very we4, when we do fight,-is at any rate not at aU true of one particular class, the class of young men of the upper or middle ranks, which the manly discipline of our good schools, public and private, is constantly sending out to commence the career of life. Here is a large class which can hardly be said to be altogether without military tastes-at least, if pugnacity is any test of such tastes. Everyb dy knows that there is the greatest difficulty in restraining the pugnacity of our schoolboys, and that they are very apt to convert a neighbourhood into an enemy's country by an artificial supposition or resolution of their own, in order solely that they may have an enemy to fight. The spirit even survives the school, and follows our young gentlemen to t.Xz. tTuiversity, where an occasional town and gown row recalls the memory of former days and keeps the flame alive. HlaLf-a-dozenor a dozen years even since school was left does not wholly Buppreas the pugnacious element, though it may give it a more manly, political, or national form. The letters we are now receiving show the existence of it, and show that it is still in good strong health and vigour, and capable of being turned to good account if the Horse Guards will only discover the proper way. Thess Indian rebels are the real enemies for our fight-loving youth, which their countrymen and neighbours at home only were by an artificial and technical arrangement, before the reality could be had. An Indian mutineer fills the gap into which the hostile imagination had only inserted an image before. Here is a true and authentio " blackguard," of which all the former ones were only feeble and conventional types. Now, we need not do what the tiresome arguer who supposes feeble objections made in order that he may show his intellectual strength in refuting them is accused of doing-" He first creates his " foes, and then he slays them." The foes are now real, true, and genuine. There is no doubt about them-no doubt that they are admirably fitted for being beaten, routed, and demolished in every possible way; that they fulfil the most insatiable demands of the most hostile fancy; that they are beyond all dispute the best enemies that could ba found. There is another feature of our class of young men. The spirit of adventure is not the same as pugnacity,-it is very different from it,-but it is at the same time a strong element in the military character. Now, this country undoubtedly produces a large class of adventurous young men, who throw themselves with great spirit into schemes of colonization, and into new undertakings which task courage and energy; but this class seldom finds its way into our army. " They com" mand," says our correspondent who describes JACE STEELn, "our merchantmen, they " make our railways, they conmtruct our en"gines, they emigrate to all our colonies and "countries where pluck, conduct, and ability can " pttsh their fortunes; but they do not enlist." This is very true. Everybody must have observed the high and manly qualities of this class,-their spirit, coolne.s, self-possession, modesty, attentiveness, industry, quickness of apprehension, good manners. They have aU the fundamental requisites for making good officers, and they have aUl the seeds of the character of a gentleman, which a very little experience and acquaintance with society would mature. But somehow or other the army seldom gets hold of these men, and never gets the full benefit of their services. They are carried by thousands every year into commerce, mechanics, and our great colonial spheres of labour and enterprise, 'Dut the whole stream passes by the army and very few join it. These are matters for the War Department and the Horse Guards to take into their consideration. They know the greatness of the present emergency,-that, however well recruiting may be going on now-and it is going on well-we want numbers, and that nothing but large numbers wml supply our reinforcements in India, and keep them up to the mark. This is not a time, then, for unnecessary offioial fastidiousness. Some way of drawing out the spirit of the nation should be devised. We know that there is the proper amount of military spirit if it can only be brought out, and if it is not brought out it will be the fault of those who did not knotv how to bring it out, or objected and criticized till any plan of doing so was too late.
COUBT CIRCULL BALMORAL, SmrT. 20. Her Majesty the Queen, accompanied by her Rtoyal Highness the Princess Helena, and attended by the Eon. Flora Macdonald, drove out yesterday. The Prince Consort enjoyed the sport of deerstalking. lis Royal Eighness the Prince Alfred, attended by Lieutenant Cowell, R.E., arrived at Bal.noral last night from Osborne. Despatches were received at the Colonial-office vesterday from the Governors of the North A merican provinces.
CRSI"rS HOSPITAZ. Yesterday being the Festival of St. Matthew, the annual orations were delivered, according to custom, by the senior scholars of Christ's Hospital, nsder the superintendence of Dr. Jacob, Upper Grammar Master, and MA C. J. Dolille, First French Master of the establishment. The prose orations, all on "the benefits of Royal Hospitals," were respectively delivered by Mr. S. W. Churchill in Latin, Mr. T. W. W. Smart im English, Mr. M. M. Ffinch in Greek, and Xr. W. E. S. Wilton in French. In these the pius memory of Edward VI was of comrse duly revered, whUe a little dexterous management brought the recent events in India within the compass of the theme. Then came a version of a speech om Shakspare's Rithard IL, in Greek lambics, by Mr. T. Mitchell, a translation of the " BLrial of Minnisink" into Latin Alcaics, by Mr. F. A. Hanbury; and another of the " Warrior Pilgrims" into Latin Elegiacs, by Mr. A. Tucker. The series concluded vit an English poem on " Memory" by Ur. S. W. Churchill, who had ready distinguished himself as a Latin orator in prose, and would likewise have distinguished himself in Latin Hexameters bad not his poem " Funis eloctricus" been onitted from consideratons of brevity. The hail was crowded In every part, and the lond applause that followed each oration Must have been most gratifying to the enthusiastic orators, and, raediately, to the preceptors, under whose snperintendencs so much talent had produced such satisfactory fruita.
TihB LA.T MuIRDER IN LEIoG WOODS, 'EAR BRISTOL.-It having becn pretty clearly ascertained that a pair of stays simUar to those worn by the deceased were purchased on the Saturday before the murder at the shop of M. Goodman, Stall-street, Bath, byaperson corresponding in dress, stature, and appearance with the deceased, who represented that she was livirng at Keynsham and Saliford, on the roed between Bath and Bristol, and that she was about tobernarried.andemigratetoAustralia, thepolice areactively exerting themselves in endeavouring to tracw out whether such a person has left the neighbourhood, and if so, whether she can be identified as the murdered woman. Yesterday morning Mr. Handeock, chief of the Bristol police, received a communication from the master of the union workhouse at Nottingham stating that a short time since a young woman named Cordelia Parkor w::s reeeived into the house, not as a pauper, but as suffering under mental aberration. She had at that time 71. in her possession, which she took with her on leaving tho house. After quitting she resided for a short poriod in the family of Mr. Renshaw, of No. 2, Lenton Sands, near Nottingham, in the capacity of under-governess. While there she received a ftrther sum of about 38. from the salo of some furniture. She left Mr. Renshaw's family and proceeded to Hul for the purpose of endeavouring to obtain employment as a teacher of music, failing -which she expressed her intention of going direct to Bristol. The master and matron of the union both state that the printed description of deceased exactly corresponds with the young woman in gestion, and the latter had an opportunity of seeing that all Cordeli Parker's linen, &c., was rnarked in a manner similar to that of the deceased. This information has been communicated to the chiefs of police at Nottingham and Hul, by whom further inquiries are being made. THE BOLER. Empixsoxo AT MAxsFST-Three of the unfortunate workpeoplo scalded by the explosion of a steam boiler belonging to Messrs. Johnson and Co., Bradford-road, Manchester, on Friday last, have since died at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Their names are John Cash, the engine-driver, Robert Fellows, and Joseph Hayes. Mr. Herford, coroner for Manchester, held an inquest on the bodies yesterduy. The first witness was the chief engineer of the works, who described the boiler, and said he was certain that at S o'clock on Friday morning tbere was Gin. to 8in. of water marked by the gauge, and that after the explosion he found the feed valve screwed down. The 6in. or 8in. of water might evaporate in three-quarters of an hour. The explosion took place an hour and three-quarters after that. Air. T. Forsyth, engineer, who had examined the boiler at the request of the coroner, was the next witness, and stated in effect that the boiler had burst through want of water and the plates of the boiler becoming red hot. He believed the boiler had been in good ordinary working order, with adequate fitting.%, and he accounted for the accident in this way-that a smail screw which fixed the valve of the feeding ap pratus to the screw handlo under the charge of Cash, the engine-driver, had gradually worlked itself ont, and hbd not been in its plce for a considerable time; that, being so, the valve had gradeaUly become unsrewred until at some time, probably vithin the lat hour and a quarter bafore the accident, it had be. come quite disaonnected and dropped into its seating. The consequence wouold h that, whatever the man in chare might do, he couldnot cause water to pass into the boiler. There was the clearest evidenoe that the flau had been red-hot over a considerable amount of surface. The admission of water upon the red-hot iron, causing the accident, he attributed to the fact that the 16 boilers on the premises, ooupled together, being at a higher level, after becoming overcharged, had llowed water to fall back through the eonnexion-pipe into the boilor that had burst, and so upon the red-hot iron pltea. 31r.

I TELEGRA-PHIC DESPATCHES i HOLLAND. OPENING OF TEE STATES GENERAL. I (Br XLCr0 AND MTERNATIONAL TXLZGRAyHr THE HAGUE, SiPr. 2L The States General assembled to-day for the session of 1857 and 1858, and the proceedings were opened as Usual by a speech frem His Majesty In person. His Majesty thanked the Chamber for their cordial co-operation in the formation and completion of the law relative to education. His Majesty informed the Chamber that his relations with foreign Powers remained upon a most peaceful and friendly footing; that the colonial possessions in the East and almost all porticns of the Dutch dominions were in a most satisfactory and peaceful condition; that the abalition of slavery in the West Indian colonies would again be brought under the attention of the Chamber ; that the balance of the Colonial credit for the current year was most satisfactory; that the country generally was in a most flourishing condition; that, although a very hot summer, preceded by a cold spring, had rendered feed for cattle scarce, the general result of the harvest was favourable; that the attention of the Government was especially directed to railway schemes, and that they had brought forward several proposals with regard to these undertakings; that it was the intention of the Government to favour private enterprises by all means ia their power, and, if necessary, even to render assistance in a pecnnihry way in the formnation of the capital; that the inrease of telegraphic communicationhadrenderelitnecssaryto open more offices aud construct new lines; and that among the financial laws to be introduced during the present seion the revision of the system of taxation would occupy a prominent place. His Majesty concluded by trusting that the pre. sent time of prosperity and peace might be used in a manner indicative of thankfulness to Almighty God for the great blessings vouchsafed to the country. His Majesty then declared the States General to be opened. SWEDEN AND NORWAY. We have reeeived the following telegram from Hamburg:- " Advices from Stockholm of the 17th inst. state that the Norwegian Storthing accepted without opposition the proposal to nominate the Crown Prince of Sweden Regent during the King's illness. " The Committee of the Swedish Parliament recommended the proposal to the Parliament with a majority of 18 votes against 5."

COMmmTVE KXA3MN'ATION8.-We are informed that arrangements are in progress for a competitive examination for commissions in the Royal Artillery aiid Royal Engineers, which will be held in January next, under similar conditions to those of the last examination. THE EDINBURmH CASTL Rocm.-The foUo,ving letter from Mr. Ruskin appears in the Mttne&s, dated "IDunbar, September 14, 1857: -As I was leaving Edinburgh this morning I beard a report which gave me noore concern than I can easily expresw, and very sulficiently poiUt the pleasure of my drive here.

SECOND EDITION. 1 THE TIMES-OFFICB, Titesday Morning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris corregpondent, dated yesterday (Monday), 6 p.m.:- The result of the Moldavian elections, now over, -i favourable to the union of the Principalities. This is by no means equivalent to saying that it is favourable to the wishes of what is known as the 7Unionist party, which makes a sine pTO non of the -Jnion under a foreign Prince. There are vnrious plans of union, each one of which has its supporters. 'The party that first got up the agitation on the subject placed at the head of their programme, as its chief condition, a foreign Prince to rule MoldoWallachia. A native Hospodar to govern the combined provinces could not meet their views; -concerning the rights of Turkey, and the degree to which they would bo i-'fringed upon and violated, at once or before long, by the adoption of their plan, they troubled tbemselves little. If the accounts that reach us from Moldavia be correct the return of a majority of deputies favourable to the union merely transfers the contest from the electoral colleges to the hall of the Divan, since, in the latter place, the Unionists will split into parties widely differing in their demands, and the degree of union 'will be a cause of discord. Supposing that which is -doubtful, namely, that the result of the deliberations of both Divans be favourable to the installation of a foreign prince at the head of a Rouman nation, this desire, it must be remembered, does not bind, although it is to be taken into considerationi by, the Paris Conference, with which the report of the Commission now in the Principalities -will doubtless have at least eqaal weight. It is unnecessary to reopen an argument that has been so often gone into as that * concerning the union of the provinces, considered both with respect to their own future 'welfare and advantage, and to its probable consequences to Europe. The question before us at present is merely that of the Moldavian elections, and that these should have returned so large a majority in favour of any kind of union, as is represented by the telegraph, is sufficient to excite surprise-to say nothing of a suspicion that, if Turkish influeace has this time been compelled to keep aloof, that of Russia may not have been so carefiully guarded against. We shall not, however, have long to wait for fuUer information than the meagre transmissions of the wires. The plan of the Emperor's German excursion ha3 undergone some slight modifications. He leaves on -the afternoon of the 23d iustead of the morning of the 24th; sleeps the first night at Lun6ville, and, it is conjectured, wiU take the opportunity of seeing I the large body of cavalry stationed there; proceeds on the 24th to Strasburg, where he will receive tho authorities, but without much ceremony or fuss, and, on the 25th, will go on to Stuttgard without further halt. The French Government has received despatches announcing that the Emperor of Morocco, who has been for some time unwell, has regulated his succession, and has appointed his son, who is Governor of the province of Tafilat, to be his heir. This young man is said to have very warlike ideas, and to differ essentially from his father's policy. It was mentioned the other day that the Emperor Nl apoleon had received an autograph letter from the Bey of Tanis. Letters from that place now announce that the Bey, in order to secure himself in the possession of his dominions, has asked the protection of France, I understand that they are working, at the Ministry of the Interior, at a project for the conversion into Goverlnient securities at 4 per cent. of nll the property of the hospitals and charitable committees (b"rcaa.x de ienufaisance), estimated at [,OOO,OOO),0oOf. The gunboat Fusee has turned up at Hongkong, but the corvette Durance is still missing. News has come of the death of a Prince of Warteniberg, a cousin of the Kirig's, but it is not supposed that this wiU make a difference as regards the approachiug visit of the Emperors to Stuttgard. The I)1etals addresses the following scornful reproof to that insignificant minority of the Paris journals vhich exults, more or less openly, at the recent deplorable events in India; and which at no time loses an opporttuity ofjjtestifying its hatred of England:- " We have been so indiscreet as to inquire of the journals which appear to found so many hopes on the events in India, what would, in their opinion, bo the best manner to teke advantage ofthe latter. e havenot asyet receivedcany replyworthy the attention of the public. The U,tivcrshas pr.cducedits plan, whiclh, it is known, consists in reconquering India for the English, wiho would give up their Meditorrarean possessions as 'he price of this asistarce. Ths Union has replied that, since it has been caUed upon t., explain, it prefers remaining silent, This represents the opinions held by that journal on Indian affairs. The Gazette de F,ranec i ay claim tho merit of having triumphed over its sivals, and of having discovered the best plans of drawing prolit from the Indian insurrection; this is, to irvite the Eimperor of Russia to invade India, and to cat aside all chivalrous sentiments, in order not to lose so capital an opportunity. This heroic manner of threaten. isg England would inspire jealousy in Mi. de Eourceaugnac, who, ia the play, exclaims so baldly, while pointing to Sbrigani, ' WVhoevir insults me will have to ronder account to that gentleman !' But none of the above jour. naLs puhl ih their secret thoughts on this matter. Thoy are well aware that, after all, the only way to distract the attention of Englanid from India would be to recall all her attention and strength to the affairs of Europe, and particularly of France. At heart, this vio lert lueas,uro would not be repugnant to their idea; and these g.eat defenders of morality and of the riglhts of na. tions would --nfirm the anprehensions of the Mlorning Ad. V-erttscr this veiy day, were it in their powerf Dut,i, 1s n 1,. convenient to confide these ideas to the public, and, rather than express them, appeals are addressed to ald the saints, to cholera, and finally to the Ewperor of Russia, to prevenit the Engli,h from reconquering India." The wcather in Paris continues magnificent; asummuer is prolonged throuoh September. Nobody remnemabers such a long period of fiie weather here atshas been enjoyed in 1857, and the present month particularly contrast:, with the corresponding one of last year, the greater part of which was cold, wet, aend wintry. The sun rises and sets, day after day, in a cloudless sky, and the evenings have been so 'warm that it has been pleasant, not only for I'arisians (who are particularly hardy in that reapect) but for foreigners, to sit in the open air until a late hour of the night. Galigneani says- - eung chestnut trees in the Luxembourg, in the 'Tuileries, and most other public gardens, are, in consequence of the mildness of the weatber, overed with flowers, as in spring; and these flowers produce a singular effect by the side of the fruit. In the Luxembourg all the trees of the avenue are in flower, though all are not equally well ex- posed to the sun. In the commune of Gentill there is a field of wheat which, though only recently reaped, is now as ;green as in January iu a favourable season. This is caused -by the grain which fell in the reaping having germinated" Within the last three or four days the tempera. -Aune has become sensibly fresher; but it is only aince then that we feel we are getting into autumn, and as yet there is no symptom of a breaking up of the fine weather. Paris, however, still continues deserted by the classes that most contribute to its -brilliancy; on the other hand it is fuller than ever -of foreigners, and erpecially of English. The -heatres, although favoured by the cooler weather, have not yet begun to revive from their summer ,dulness, or to tempt the public with new pieces. 'The only novelty in the dramatic world is the appearance of Signor Salvini, who, highly spoken of by many of the critics on his first appearance in Voltaire's tragedy of Zflse, seems to have esta. blished himself in public favour, and in the opinion of all, as a great actor, by his performance of an Italian version of Othello. In the programme of the Italian Opera, which is to open on the 1st of October, figures, besides the names of a number of old favourites, that of Signor Giuglini. This, as I understand, will have to be erased in future announcements. The management was in treaty vwith Giuglni; it was even believed that he was engaged; and the musical public of Paris looked forward with eager interest to hearing a singer who had aroused such enthusiasm and con. quered such celebrity in London. But, for this sea. son at least, Paris is doomed to disappointment, for the much-desired tenor has declined the engagement. At the Francais, the Opera Comique, and the other principal theatres, they are playing old pieces. M. Octave Feuillet's drama of Dalila is at its 101st representation at the Vaudeville. From Madrid we learn that Madame Ristori, who is engaged for a series of performances at the theatre of the Zarzuela, has been received with the same enthusiasm that she has excited wherever she has appeared. Among the arrivals at Paris are to be noted those of the Duke and Duchess of Alba, of m. de la Tour d'Auvergne, late French Minister at the Court of Tuscany, and of General Buhler, a Frenchman by origin, General in the Persian service, and who commanded the engineers at the siege of Herat. The last named is on leave of absence. A letter from the camp of Chalons, dated last night, says:- " This being the first Sunday since the opening of the branch line from Cbalons to the present residence of His Majesty, the camp presented an unusually animated scene, thousands having come to witness the imposing spectaole of the celebration of mass in presence of all the various regiments. vhat vwith the troops assembled before the altar and the multitude of visitor3, the extensive ground was one complete mass of living beings. The commencement of the religious ceremony was fixed for 9 o'clock, by which time the Emperor had taken his place opposite the altar. Mass was celebrated by Mgr. Menjaud, Bishop of Nancy, first chaplain. to the Emperor. The troops, who were in full uniform, were ranged round the altar-the cavalry were on horseback, and the artillery at their gUns. The spectacle was a magnificent one. After Divine ecrvice the Imperial Guard filed off In presence of the Emperor and of the Duke of Cambridge. A great number of visitors from Paris were present. At night the camp was iPuminated by large bonfires at different points, and a grand display of fireworks took place. Goddard was to have again ascended, but, unfortunately, the b.lloon, which had been filed with gas at Chhlons, burst while being conveyed to the camp." l'he following private telegraphic despateh has been received "JASSY, Ssrr. 19. "The clas3 of smail landowners has elected nine deputiet who are unionists, two who are Anti-Unionists, and three who are doubtful. The class of owners of real property in towns, inembers of liberal professlons and traders, have elected 19 Unionists and one Anti-Unionist. Of the four deputies elected for the capital three are Unionists, and the two for Galatz are the same. Perfect order has prevailed during the elections." Every branch of trade in Paris is at present in full activity. Foreign commission agents have commenced their purchases, and orders are arriving from almost every country in Europe, as wel as fi om the Brazils and other parts of South America. Many orders have likewise been received from the provinces. The deficient harvests during the last three years and the Russian war restrained purchases in every direction, and there are now numerous deficiencies to be supplied both at home and abroad. Mercantile transactions would be still more animated in Paris were it not for the exorbitant price of the raw material used in manufactures, which forces the manufaoturers to make a proportional ad vance in the price of their produce. Another impediment to be deplored is, that there is a vast capital invested by commercial men in railway shares, which cannot now be realised except at a serious loss. Almost aU the millowners in the provinces are now working fuU time. Numerous commission agents have arrived at Rouen, Mulhouse, Roubaix, Turcoing, Amiens, and Reims. The manuf.acturers of Lyons are kept going chiefly by orders from Paris for expensive silks and velvets. The ailk mnarkets in the departments of the Drome and the Ardeche are dull, there being few buyers, and prices are merely nominal. Many mills having been more or less seriously damaged by the late inundations, the owners have been forced to suspend business. One description of China silk has fallen at Lyons from 94f. to 76f. the kilogramme. There were 69 bales sold at Marseilles last week at prices varying from 28f. to 93f. There has been a rise on beetroot sugar both in Paris and Lille. Good quality is quoted at Lille at 83f. and 84f. There were 2,500 casks of Bourbon sugar sold at Marseilles for delivery at 73f. The price of tallow in the Paris mrrket is unchanged. It is quoted at X 7f. 50c., but as the stock is low a rise is shortly expected. It was difficult to effect sales at the Paris flour iwarket on Friday, there being so many offers for delivery and for time. One sale was effccted of a small lot of flour from the Beauce, for bakerb' use at 58f. th3 sack of 157 kilogrammes. Fleur from Etampes vas offered at 56f. for immediate delivery, and for 54f. in the month of November. The stock ia the market stores has increased to 17,953 quintals. Wheat was likewise much offered in the Paris market, but there were few buyers. The millers insisted on a further reduction of price, and they succeeded in purchasing Lorraine wheat, for delivery in October, at 32f. the 120 k-ilogrdmmes, which is equivalent to 21f. the hectolitre. Some samples of Burgundy wheat were sold for delivery at 33f. for red wheat of Dijon, and 33f. o0c. for ChAlons wheat. The accoUnts from the departments announce a fall in all the corn markets. The farmers, being now convinced of the abundance of tbe haivest, are detormined to bring their corn to ! market. Thesupply ssconsequenuy every whereplen- tiful. Flour of the first quality has fallen rapidly at Nantes from 63f. to 58f. the sack of 159 kilogrammes, aud at rennes from 40f. to 33f. the sack of 100 kilogrammos. The price of wine is declining at Bercy, particularly for ordinary quality. The arrivals from Orleans and Bordeaux by railway are consider. able, and the cellars at Bercy were never better stocked than at present. Business is becoming more limited at Bordeaux according as the vintage approaches, the holders of stock not being willing to lower their demands asnd buyers not being disposed to give high prices. The vineyards in the Bordelais are more stocked with grapes than for several years past, and, though the oidiunm has caused some damage, it is the less felt as the late rains have greatly increased the size of the grapes. It is expected that the quality of the wine will be very superior. There has been a greater fall in the price of wine in the department of the Var in consequence of the quautity received from Italy. Hailstorms have caused some injury in the Gard, particularly at Roquemaure. What wine there is, however, is of very excellent quality. There is little doing in brandies. Beetroot spirit is quiet In Pawi, at 107f., and Lanaguedoc spirits of wine is offered at 200f. the hectolitre.

Not long since mention was made in my correspondence of a prevalent report that a meeting was to take place between the Emperors of Austria and Russia, and positive information has now reached me that steps were not long since taken for bringing about an interview between them. The person who mediated was a member of the Royal Family of Wurtemberg, and for a time it was believed that his endeavours to effect a reconciliation between the two potentates would be successful, but eventually it was found that the Court of Russia could not resolve to let by-gones be by-gones. The foregoing information was acquired at a German source, but that which is about to follow was received from a person who is on extremely intimate terms with the Russians residing in thia city. When Baron Budberg, a short time since, returned here so suddenly from Warsaw, he was in such a violent hurry to see Count Buol, that he drove direct from the railway station to the Foreign-office. My i'i. formant did not say that the Russian diplomatist had been commissioned to make arxangements for a meeting between the Czar and the Emperor Francis Joseph, but he gave me to understand that an annaherung (approximation) between the Rusrian and Austrian Courts was by no means unlikely. The Emperor Napoleon is endeavouring to establish a good understanding between aU the great Powers, in order that they may be able to reduce their enormous standing armies, but he wil probably find Austria less docile than either Russia or Prussia. The reduction of the army would be a very great relief to Austria, but she is jealous of the continually increasing influence of the Emperor of the French, and unwilling to recognize his claim to be considered the director of the affairs of Europe. A reconciliation between Russia and Austria is more likely to be brought about by Prussia, or by some other German Power, than by France. There will be great festivities at Stuttgard while the two Emperors are there, but as yet little more is settled than that Balfe's opera, the Bohemian Girl, is to be given on the 27th inst. Fourteen battalions of the line, 18 squadrons of cavalry, 40 guns, and sundry detachments of Chasseurs and pioneers will parade before the King's iUustrious guests, among whom will be the King of Bavaria, the Grand Duke of Baden, and several other German Sovereigns. It has re peatedly been stated iu the Germau papers that Barons Bourqueney and Budberg-the French and Russian Ministers at this Court-will be at Stuttgard on the 27th inst., but up to the present mo6' ment they have not received any instructions on the subject. Count Buol is better, but it is related that h;s physicians insist on his going to Carlsbad for two or three weeks. Slight mention has already been made of a quarrel between Count Hunyady, a major of hussars, and the Mayor of Hiltteldorf, a small place near Vienna, and it is necessary to return to the subject, as the affair was far more serious than is generally suppoEed. The Mayor of HiAtteldorf received notice 'that he was to provide quarters for 300 Hussars, and he did so. At the appointed hour the Major airived, but, as he brought with him 500 instead of 300 men, the accommodation provided was naturally instfficient. Instead of politely requesting the Mayor to find quarters for the additional 200 men, the Mlajor began to curse and swear at and even to menace him. The latter, a man of spirit, told the military bully that he seemed to forget that he was bound to treat the civil authorities with respect. On hearing this, the officer declared that if the Mayor said another word he would "give him 25" (blows). The Mayor retorted, and the consequence was that be was placed with his face downwards on a bench, and 25 blows inflicted on that part of his body which begins where the spine ends. As soon as the punishment was inflicted the poor Mayor had himself transported to the house of the nearest judge iu criminal matters and demanded satisfaction. An attempt was made by an influential military personage to hush up the affair, but it came to the knowledge of the highest authorities, and Major Count Hunyady was charged with " abuse oF official power" (miss?n'anch der amksgewalt), tried by a court-martial, cashiered, and condemued to two years' imprisonment in a fortress. The "N aval Academy," which iz an imniense establishment, has just been completed at Fiume, the only port on the Croatian coast. The building, which is in the form of a horseshoe, is 318 feet long and 70 feet high. It contains 198 apartments, 15 of which are large saloons, or rather halls. The facade of the edifice, which is entirely of stone, is said to be remarkably handsome. Yesterday the grand cavalry manceuvres began at Perendorf, in the presence of the Emperor, who was accompanied by a very large suite. Among the distinguished foreigners present were the Duke of Mecklenburg and Prince Charles of Bavaria. The Empress and the Archduchess Elizabeth witnessed the manceuvre from their carriage, and then drove round the camp, which is on a very grand scale. After having taken a late dinner, the Court returned to the Imperial castle at Laxenburg. The camp will not be raised until the end of the month. M. Ladislaus Magyar, the Hungarian traveller in Southern Africa, has sent some particulars of his various journeys to his father, who resides at Theresiopel, in the Banet. Al. Magyar has explored tliu cteuUritz wawerd by eh0 river Congo, and will publish a map of them, which he, with the assistance of some Portuguese engineers, is now preparing. The Hungarian, who is in the service of Portugal, received from the Government of that country the commission of a major, on his promising that an account of his travels should be published in the Portuguese language. The letters received by his father are dated Yak-Quilem, kingdom of Kalunder (40 4' south latitude, and 23° 43' east longitude), Central Ohila (160 south lat., and 150 20' east long.), and Ambriz (60 45' south lat., and 12 east long.) The countries on the Zaire or Congo river were explored in 1848, but the letters describing them were not written untl 1851 and 1853. The subjoined extracts from thePesth Lloyd ,will prove to you that my accounts of the monetary and commercial crisis have not been exaggerated:- " There are rumours here of several failures, and among others of the great cotton-printing establishment of Glogon and Sons. The mysterious disappearance of the chief of the firm led to the suspension of its payments. The want of confidence iu the mercantile world is increasing, and it is a positive fact that several most respectable houses are necessitated to make the greatest efforts in order to meet their obligations." Baron Braek is said to have been in better spirits yesterday, but a day or two since he was extremely dejected, and " seemed quite at a loss to know what measures to take." Above a hundred Austrian officers have offered to take service in the English army in India. The news from India is literally devoured by the Austrian officers, but the last tidings have produced a very disagreeable impression on them. They begin to fear that the little bands of heroes vffl be aufgeriebem (aestroyed) in detail before reinforcements can reach them. Rosza Sando;, the famous bandit and guerilla chief, has been. removed from Szegedin to Buda, Sih,ore h%~6+ iitried by the civil authorities. As there is no proof that Roeza has ever taken the life of any one, capital punishment will hardly be Inflicted on him. The telegraphic news of the 12th, frora Constan. tinople, are as follows -Vaffif Pasha is Grand Master of the Artillery, instead of Fethi Achmed Pasha. Selim PaBha is Commander of the Imperial Guard. It is said that the Sirdar Omar Pasha is to be Stadtholder-General of Bagdad. MM. de Thouvenel and Boutenieff have had an audience of the Sultan, who expressed his satisfaction that the diplomatic relations had been renewed. General Durando is unwell. The English Minister is on good terms with the Persian Government, but the news of the evacuation of Herat requires confirmation. ITALY. A letter from Turin of the 17th says "1 The autumn manuetyres commenced yeMerday. The troops consisted of four regiments of Infantry, two of Rifle. men, a reglment of Light Cavalry, sad two mounted bAtteries, and all the movements were well executed. The weather was superb. General Sonnaz, at the head of the first militsa division, commanded. The manceuvres are to be repeated twice a week to the end of September, and next month there are to be sham fights in the neighbourhood of Turin xand Genoa." Ihe King of the Belgians arrived at Como on the 13th, and on the following day proceeded to his villa on the lake. SPAIN. Royal decrees in the Madrid Gazette of the 17th dissolve the Royal Council of Public Instruction, reorganize it in accordance with the existing law, and appoint AL Martinez de la Rosa President of the new Council. Another Royal decree makes the Patriarch of the Indies a Knight of the First Class of the Order of Charity, for his aervies as President of the Charitable Junta of Galicia.

AMERICA. (BY ELECTRlIC TELEGRA.PH.) SOUTHAMPTON, TUESDAY MORINZG. The Vanderbilt, steamer, Captain Higgins, has arrived at Cowes with advices from New York to the 12th inst., $1,272,200 in specie, and 180 pasEengera for Southampton and Havre. The Vanderbilt passed the Baltic on the 13th, in lat. 40.24, long. 68.47. The convention with New Granada was signed at Washington on the 10th. The Tehuantepec question has been settled at Mexico by the annulment of both the Garay and Sloo grants. The municipal election at Leavenworth, Kansas, resulted in the election of the Free State ticket by 260 majority. Several other failures were announced on the New York Stock Exchange. The most important was the suspension of Messrs. Willam J. Bell and Co., bankers, whose assets, however, were said to largely I exceed their liabilities, and they confidently expected soon to resume payment. The New York Stock-market on the 11th inst. was slightly better at the first board. The amount of business transacted was not so large as usual, and in some stocks the operations were principally on time-buyers' option. New York Central Railroad advanced J per cent.; Erie, i; Reading, 14 ; Michigan Southern Old, j; ditto Preferred, 1. American Excbange Bank declined 3 per cent.; Metropolitar, 1; Delaware and Hudson, A; Ilinois Central, 2; Cleveland, Columbus, and Cinc:natti, 2; Chicago and Burlington, 5. The decline in Bank Stocks continued, with daily increasing sales. There was a sale of Erie Convertible, 1871, at 43i to 44 per cent. (a fewdays previous these bonds were selling freelyat 60 per cent.); La Crosse and Milwaukie, and Grand Bonds, sold at 35 per cent. ; at the second board the market was lower, and closed very weak. A very smaU amount of business was transacted.

The sales of cotton embraced about 700 bales, based upon rmiddling uplands, at 15ic. The receipts and stock of common grades of flour were light, and prices steady at the previous day's quo. tations; extra grades were less buoyant, without material change in quotations. Wheat was in good supply and lower; a good deal of the new arrived out of order and sold at low figures; sound closed at lower prices. Corn sold to a fair extent at 70c. to 71Ic. for western. Mixed pork was firmly held, with moderate sales of mess at $25 75c. to $26. and of prime at $21 25c. to $21 40c. Sugars were quite steady, while prices were unchanged. The sales embraced about 1,100 hhds. Cuba Muscovado, including a portion for refining. Coffee was in fair request, with sales of about 1,530 bags of Rio at 1 ilc. to 11lc. Freights continued steady at the late advance, and to Liverpool about 30,000 bushels of wheat were engaged at 54d. in bulk and Gd. in ships'bags. Considerable lots of sugars were also engaged to London and Liverpool, and 300 hhds. to Bremen.

Let every volunteer pass a simple examination and proeuce certificates as to gentlemanly conduct, &c., and I a*m certain that after events would show that there were a peLt Lnumber of " Jack Steels" in the corps. I enclose my card, and beg to remain, Your obedient servrant Al%'ATRlz.T?- VnTTXT"- W Sept. 19. TO TaE EDITOR OF TEEE TIlMES. Sir,-In the present exigency, when every Indian mail brings news still more alarming than the ket, it becomes daily more apparent that large reinforcements are stiU required in India. It is equally plain that England herself cannot be left without adequate means of defence. Hence our great, our imperative want is men, for men soon boecome soldiers. Lord Palmerston ought to take the responsibilty of raising every possible soldier, trusting to the pablic opinion of tho COUntry to support him against the carping criticism of his olitical opponents, who will be only too happy to accuse of mantaining military establishments unnecessarily high in case it shall turn out, happUy, that we have a battaUon or t60 to spare, Ahove all things, let us, if possible, be on the safe side. Under these views I trast your powerful voice may advocate some a' least of the foUowing measures, aU of which appear to me to bo advisable:- t. Lower the standard for the infantry to 5ft. 4in., attaching some conditions as to girth round the chest, conformation, and total weight of the man. The Enfield rifle is lighter and altogether a much more handy weapon than the old musket, or "Brown Bess." The rifle is as forrsidable in the hands of a well-built little man as in those of the grenadier. Numbers of French soldiers are not more than oft. 4in. English, and yet are most efficient as foot soldiers. 2. Raise the bounty at once from a free kit and 21. in cpsh to a free kit and 51. in cash. Daring the great war against France sill higher bounties were given. 3. Improve the Day of the sergeants and corporals. Give the soldier more to look forward to in the ranks. On no system can many hope to obtain a commission; aU may aspire to be non-commissioned officers. 4. CaU out and embody permanently all the Militia of the three kingdoms, filling the ranks without delay by ballot, as in the great Frenoh war. This measure would at once give a domestic army to defend the united kingdom, It would free every regular infantry soldier now at home; *for instance, 4,000 or .5,000 men of the Foot Guards could be sent to India. The Goards fought in N orth Amorica, in Egypt, and iu the Crimea, why shonld not such first-rate soldiers fight in IndiaX? Let uns remember thatit is only by fighting that Iadia can be saved, and England maintain her high position amongnations. 5. The men of the Militia so raised should, as inthe French war, be encouraged by bounties to volunteer into the Line. 6. The Artillery, Engineers, and Cavalry should be gadually augmented by tho amount of those arms sent to 7. There is no reason why 3,000 more ArtiUery and 500 or 600 Engineers should not be sent at once. The Militia Artillery would in acme measure supply the place of the first corps. 8. Encourage the Canadians to raise colonial regiments for their own defence. Accept their services for lndia if offered. The same at the Cape and AustraUia. Leave only one battalion of the regulars at Qaebec, and one at Cape Town. Let the Cane colonists fight the Caffres in their own way. 9. If the'ranks of the Militia be not immediately flUed by ballot, it will be necessary to resort to the unpopular experiment of raising German and Swiss mercenaries; for men we must have at whatever coet. I am. Sir. vonrs Sn. ONE WHO HAS SRRVRD 40 YEA PS Sept. 19. TO TEIE EDITOR OF TECH TIMES. Sir,-The following facts will corroborate " A Young Englishman's" opinion that the volunteer spirit is abundant in England, and only requires to bo permitted to show itself in order to do so in an effective way. A few years ago, before the present Emperor of the French had given us reason to believe in his prudence, there prevailed a not unnatural fear of what might be the result of his sudden accession to unlimited power, and this fear was shared by our Government of the time, as was proved by certain steps taken by them. Under these circumstances I asked a few of my friends to join with ime in the formation of a rifle corps, and, in a letter which you did me the honour to print, I mentioned the faot tbat 18 or 19 out of the first 20 young men to whom I proposed the plaa immediately joined in ic The result was that in a few day:s about 300 gentlemen sent in their names. We then asked the sanction of the Government to the enrolment of a volunteer ride corps of 1,000 gentlemen-for it was evident we should SOOn hAve attained that number-eaolb of whom would be prepa,ed to expend his IOL or 121, on a regulation mini6 rifle and a suitable auuifon.

I have been trying since the outbreak of the mutiny in India to obtain some employmnent the,re, to compass which I wrote to the Hon. Board of Director, offering my services. A reply was received after a short delay civilly declining .hem. Now, I know not how to set aboat serving my country and avenging the foul murders of innocent women and children. I have no influence to enable me to obtain a commission, and through lack of means cannot purchase one ; for the last reason I am unable to pay my passage to India, trusting on my arrival there to find red tape and routine partilly abolished, and to find something to do. I do not feel Inclined to enlist In the ranks, and after several years' hard Eervice be promoted to the hlgh dignity of sergeant-major. My education has been that of a gentleman, and I hope my manners are the same. To quote the words of your correspondent, I am one of those hundreds " who are willing to place themselves at the disposal of the Government, without bounty beforehand, or the promise of a gratiflication afterwards, if it will only give us plenty of active service and a fair chance of distinguishing ourselves, and promotion according to merit." Can you or any of your readers inform these young Englishmen the way to honour ELj fame ? Iam. Sir. vonr naAiAn+. .- A TRUE BRITON. London, Sept. 19. TO THE EDITOR OF TEM TIMES. Sir,-In your impression of to-day I read with mach pleasure the letter signed " A Young Englishman." I, too, am certain many hundreds would gladly join at the first intimation of the embodiment of a company of volunteers, composed of such a class that they, after some examination and inquiry into their antecedents, may be deemed eligibie to serve in it. In the event of such a warraut beiug issued, I will answer that in less than a month the Government will have as stanch, effective, and soldier-like a body of men as any in the service, all anxious to distinguish themselves and revenge the wholesale murder of their countrymen. Let it le officered by the election of the company themselves to a certain rank, and it wil not be worse disciplined because the officers are the favourites of the men. Not one battalion cnly, but a dozen might be raised throughout the kingdom in this way. Letters sent to the War-office are of no avail if offering eervice. I myself received an answer this morning to the effect that the Government had no use for my services, and I am only one of a legion who receive the same answer through want of inflnence at the Horse Guards.

The class I allude to are young men in the middle ranks of life, of good education, but with means and desires falling short of those required for spending a lifetime in the army, of good bodily strength, and eager to serve their country in a time of trial.

ASCZNTS OF THE GRA4iyNEIR AND GRAND COMBIN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I wish to call the attention of the numerous gentle. men engaged every year in investigating the physical geograpby of Switzerland to the group of five snow monutains lying north.east of the Great St. Bernard, between the val de Bagnes and the Val d'Eutremont, and which are at pre. tent so little known that even the otherwise excellent map of G. Studer gives but the Jaintest approximation to their true relations. The highest mountain of the group is X most conspicuous and beautiful object In the views from the Dent dn Mlidi, Mont Velan, the Col de la Seigne, and I believe also from Mont Blanc. It is generally but erroneously described as the Grand Combin, a name really belongimg to quite a subordinate summit; the inhabitants of the Valley of Ollomont call it " La Grande Chermontane," and those of the Val de Bagues the " Graireneire," by which name I shall hereafter designate it, Its probable height (Ziegler-" Samnmalng der absoluten uIohen der Scheaiz" p. 131) is 4,308 metres, or 14,130 English feet, and the guides throughout Switzerland bAve hitherto declared it quite inaccessible, as they always do mountains of which they have not made the ascent. The only way yet known of penetrating into the heart of this region is by the gLader of Corbusibre, a long and narrow stream of ice flowing due north, nearly paraUel to the Val de Bagnes, into which the alacier torrent discharges itself just above Lourtier. Its upper or southern portion is a large snow basin connected with the glacier of Mont Darand by an undescribed col, about 10,000 feet high, which I propose to caU the Col de Corbassibre. In ascending the glacier its channel is bounded on the right or western side, first by the Pic de Scry, a pyramidal rolcy mass, Without snow, and then by tho carious rocks of the Avoulons and the Follats. Behind and above these latter rises the Petit Combin, and the chain is term inated on the south by the Grand Combin, which falls steeply down to the snow basin of Corbassibrc. Further south are two roch:y bays, the first of which runas out from the east of the Grand Combin, while the second extends by a line of low peaks to the Col de Corbasmi6re, and probably contains a passge to St. Pierre. On the east of the glacier we have first the Bec de Corbassicre, and then a long ridge of rock extending to a singalar semicircular opening just opposite the Grand Combin, called the Passage de Graffcneire. The Graftineire itrell forms the western sde of the basin from the passage to the CoL The glacier of Corbassicro is divided Into an upper and a lower level by a cliff which runs across the channel from the Avoulons. The western end only of the cliff is covered ,with a fall of icy spires; the glacier has retreated from the eastern end and left its surface bare and polished. The upper level has, in fAct, long been shrinking; outside the present eastern " moraiae " are two older ones parallel to it/ but the outer of the two has been broken through in many places by recent falls from the rocks above. A torrent issues from the glacier ou the upper level, and, after falling down the cliff re-enters it by a cave, which at the same time engaulfs the whole of the " moraine," a peculiarity of which I know no other instance. I spent several days among the Montagnes de Bagnes ia August, 1S56, and ascended the Grand Combin in mistake for the Graff6neire, but I shall not describe this ascent as one of the objects of my letter is to deter other travellers from repeating the blunder. This year I revisited Switzerland, and heard at Sion that two chasseurs of Sourtier - MIunrice Felley and Juvence Bruobey-had succeeded in climbing the Graffnere I therefore reluctautly parted from my companions of the Finster-air-horn, and on Monday, the 16th ult., crosseuifrom the Rhone Valley to Chablais over the Colde Verbier, taking with me as guide Auguste Simond, of Chamsoanim. I received a hearty welcome and every possible assistance from hL Pierre Perrodin, the landl,rd of the rough but most comfortable inn at C hablais, and at 12 o'clock on Tuesday, accompanied by Sitnond, the two chasseurs, and a mule carrying provisions, started for Corbasaiise. Our pl,an -was to sleep as high as poedble, get on the summit early on Wednesday morning, cross the CoL and deseend on the other side, if possible, to Ollomond, or failing that to Chermontano. We ascended the Val de Bagnes, crossed the Dransejust above Granges Neaves, and then struck up the mountain pastures on the left of the glacier of CorbassidreWe soon reached the ch§lets, vwhich in consequence of recent falls of snow had been brought much lowver down the mountain; hero we secured two pa!ls of milk, and carried them two honrs higher up to our sleeping quartets, an old ch6let just at the base of the cliff in the glacier, where we arrived at 5 o'clook. We started by lantern light at 3 a.m. on Wednesday, mounted the cliff, and walked along the top of the old " morain ;" arrived at its ex tremity we continued for somne distanee along the rocks, instead of crossing the glacier as last year to the foot of the Combin. The morning was very fine, and the view of the Combin with its exquisite peak, and of the Graffeneire, covered from top to bottomn with snow, which hung In many places on the mountain side in threatening hummocky masses, seemed to me scarcely surpassed by the scenery of Monte Rosa. We soon took to the " n6u,," and perceived at once the task that lay before us. It was covered, and, as it turned out, the whele mountain also, with fresh snow, nowhere less than 18 inobes deep. We toiled through this for some hours, and it was not tiUl 9.20 that we reached a point at the foot of the mountain, about an hour distant from the CoL Here Bruchey, who had told me he was " chasseur dc ch4mois par passion,' expressed his inability to prooeed further, and leaving him injunctions to examinetL_ .ol the reat of our party comrmenced the ascent of the mountain. The snow got worse at every step, F elley constantly lagged in the rear, and bad it not been for the courage and energy of Simond I never should have made the ascent. The mountain is terminated by two peaks lying north and south; we climbed the northern and arrived at Its summit about half-past 2. On the side of the Val de Bagnes cliffs of frightful stcepp nss stretohed dow;n from our standing plaoo to the foot of the Tour de Boussine. The weather had unfortunately entirely changed' and excepting the mountains close to us, we saw nothing but a vast sea of clouds with the snowy head of Mont Blanc rising from the midst. From the position of the Graff%neir. standing asit does midway between Mont BlancandMonte Rosa, from its dominating all the peaks immediately surrounding it; and from the description the chasseurs gave of their first ascent) the view in fi ne weather must be one of tha most remarkable in Switzerland. The southern peak ap. peared to me slightly the higher. It could have beemo mounted without difficulty, but we had no time to attempt it; we descended rapidly and reached tbe bottom at 5. Bruchey gave an unfavourable report of the Col, but had it heen otherwise it would have been madness to ente upon an unknown glacier at so late an hour. We reluctantly retraced our steps, arrived at the chMlet at 9.30, and walked to Chablxis to breakfast the next morning. I regret to add that Simond so much over-exerted himself that he was ill for several days, and was by no means recoverod when I left Switzerland. With the snow in good order and the weather fine the ascent might be made with no difficulty and little danger, and the inn easily regained the seoand night. For the thorough clearing up of the geography it would be neoes. sary to ascend the glacier of Mont Darand, and try to cross the Col on to that uf Corbassidre. Expeditions with a similar object should be undertaken from the valley of Ollomont and from St. Piorre. I trust I may be the means of in. ducing Alpine travellers to make theso excursions and to explore still further the noble seerery of the Montagnes da Bagnes.

THE INDIAN MUTINIES. The following is a translation of a proolamation poet~d up by Nena Sahib at Cawnpore:- "A traveller just arrived in Cawnpore from Calcutta states that in the first instanoe a council was held to take into consideration the means to be sdopted to do away with the religion of the Mlahomedans And lindoos by the distribution of cartridges. The council came to this resolution, that, as this matter was one of religion, ioe services of seven or eight thousand European zoldiers would be neessary, as 50,000 Hindoetanees would have to be destroyed, and then the whole of the people of Hindostan would becoma Christians. A petition with the substance of this resolution was sent to the Queen Victoria, and it was approved. A council was then held a second time, in which English merchants took a part, and it was decided that, in order that no evil should arise from matiny, large reinforcements shlould be sent for. When the despatch was received and read in England thousands of European soldiers were embarked on ships as speedily as possible and sent off to Hindoetan. The news of their being despatchod reached Calcutta. The English authorities there ordered the issue of the cartridges, for the red intention was to Christinize the army first, and this being effected the conversion of th 3 people would speedily follow. Pigs' and cows' fat wa% mixed up with the cartridges; this became known through one of the Bengalese who was employed in the cartridge. maldng establishment. Of those through whose means this was divlged one was killed and the rest imprisoned. While in this country these eounsels were being adopted. In England the Vakeel of the Sultan of Roum sent news to the Sultan that thousands of European soldiers were bing sent for the purpose of mpking Christians of all the people of Hindostan. Upon this Sultn issued a firman to the King of Egypt to this eSect:- You must deceive the Queen Victoria, for this is not a time for friendship, for my Vakeel writes that thousands of European soldiers have been despatched for the purpose of Making Christians the army and people of Hindoetan, In this manner, then, this must be checked. If I should be remiss, then how can I show my fac to God; and one day this may come upon me also, for if the English make Christians of all lin Hindostan they vill then fix their desgs upon my country.' When the firman reached the King of Egypt he prepared and arranged his troops, before tho arrival of the English army at Alexandria, for this is the route to India. The instant the English amy arrived the King of Egypt opened guns upon them from all sides, -ad destroyed And sunk their ehips, and not a single soldier escaped. The English in Calcutta, after the Issue of the order for the cartridges, and when the mutiny had become great, were in expectation of the arrival of the army from London; but the Great God In bis omnipotence had before. hund put an end to tbis. When the news of the destruction of the army of London became known, then the Governor. General was plunged In grief and sorrow and beat his head. "Printed by order of the Peishwar Bahadour." THE GARRISON OF FUTTYGHUR. The following is an extract of a letter containing, we fear, a too weUl authenticated account of the fate of the garrison at Futtyghur:- " August 6. "I fear there is little doubt that the garrison of Futty. ghur have been murdered by that fiend Nena 8ahib. I hear the deposition of a servant has arrived here, stating that after a struggle of nine days the small band was overcome, that the Nawab of Furrmokabad furnished them with boats, and thatthey were aU kied by Nena in cold blood after pas3ing Bithoor. Of the 10th Native Infantry this includes, I believe, Brigadier and Mrs. Smith, Munro, Phillott, PhUli. more. Fitzgerald and vwife, Simpson, Swetenham, Hender. son, Eckford, Dr. Eeatheote and family; then there were the Rev. Mr. Fisher and wife, hJr. and Mrs. Lowis, Major and Mrs. Robertson. Tucker, the clothing agent, was shot throtugh the head when looking through a loophole. " I have just seen the servant's deposition taken at Ghazeepore. It appears that the fugitives moored thelr boats near Cawnpore, thelr boatmen ran away, the gentlemen gave the villagers money to induce them to get more men, instead of which they told Nena, who sent convey. ances for them, confined them in the Assembly-rooms, and when Brigadier-General Eavelck beat his troops and took his gus he had the whole party butchered. " He is reported to have said he could now die happy, a, he had kiUled 1,000 ' Ferlnghees,' and I fancy he has cora pleted about that number, including the Christians at Cawn. pore and the Futtyghur refugees (in all about 150, inoludlug those who fled early in Tune). " A deserter of the 10th Native Infantry, a Sepoy, was seized at Ghazeepore, riding Swetenham's horse. Be said that Captain Bigne31 was with a Zemindar in Oude, so I suppose he is the only survving officer of those with the regiment. Ensgn Byrne, who went with Captain Bignell, has not since been heard of. Mr. Lindsay died from exposure at Cawupore. Irwin and family have not been heard of since leaving the Gwalior Contingent. Coke and Raid are doing good service with their corps before Delhl, Thompson is a mounted volunteer with Blavelock. Law and WiUows are in the hiUs; Martineau at Delhi or Umballa. " N.B-Brevet-CaptainLawis since reported hilled before Delhi." DELHI. The following are copies of communications received from a lieutenant of Bengal Engineers by various friends. Though accounts of a considerably later date have been published, they are stiLl not without interest:- " Camp, Delhi Cantonments, July 7. "You wiLl see that we are stiU before Delhi; that we aro not in it is not our fault. I wil not say that we shall not be in Delhi b3fore long, but as there is no saying into whose hands letters may fall it is well to be sUent on these Points. Our present occupation seems t, be driving the enemy back whenever he shows himself, which to do him justice is not seldom, though not so frequently as when we first came here. The Bareilly rascals had the impudence to come round to our rear a fevw days ago, and our onlyregret is that one of them ever got back. I was out with the force sent against them, and cannot say that Ifelt much pity for the redcoated villain8with"' 68,"" '18," and " 28" on their buttons. Mercy seems to have fed from us for ever, and if ever there was such a thing as war to the knife we certainly have it here. The Sepoys stand well to their guns, and work them fully as well as ourselves, which is little to be wondered at when you think of the pains we have taken to teach them gunnery. The astonishing thing is to see how different the story becomes when I'andy (camp name for the enemy after 'Mungul Pandy,' the first mutineer hanged) sees a bayoneS pointed at him. We have aU read and heard much of 'the British cheer,' but its effect must be se en to be appreciated, I never saw it better than at Badli-ka-Serai. Pandy's gun 3 were all in position, and a beautiful positionit was; everygun was in fnU play, and our advance column, under Brigadier Grant, with which I was, had got round Pandy's flank to his rear. Nothing was to be heard but heavy guns and the rattle of musketry, in the very teeth of which Her Majesty's 75th and 1st Europeans wero marching up as if on parade, 'when that British cheer saluted our ears. It was like magic. Every gun except or- own was silent immediately, thougb certainly not for very long. Even musketry seemed almost to have ceased, and we knew that the bayonet was doing its work on all who waited for it. It was some little time beforc the enemy's guns opened again, and when they did I can assure you they did not forgive the advance column for out-man,euvring them. I had not up tiU this time paid much heed to the shot flying all around me, for, galoping along at full speed with horse artiUery and cavalry thunder. ing after you is some small excitement to a 'gr4ffl' and as I was the guide to the column I felt somewhat interested in taking up our position quickly. But it is a very difrereut story standing quietly under heavy fire for the first time, with nothing to do but to look on. I quite envied the gunners who were so hard at work, for it is no small satifaction working to such good purpose, and I cAnnot say that I felt my heazt breaking at the sight of these rascals getting their deserts. This is war in its very worst phase, for generosity towards an enemy seems tc f .2ter into no one's mind. If anyone owes these Sepoys a grudge I think I have some claim to one but I must say that I cannot bring myself to put my sword through a wounded Sepoy. I cannot say that I grievo much when I see it done, as it invariably is; but grieve or not, as you please, he is a clever man who can keep back a European from driving his bayonet through a Sepoy, even if in the agonies of death. The hardest fighting goes on at the right of our position. Our batteries are at this point, and Pandy's whole efforts seem concentrated on it. Be has good cover from the Lahore-gate of Delhi up to the very foot of the hilh on which our batteries are. This cover consists of houses, walled gardens, and large enclo. sores with high walls loopholed at the top. They have made a good many attempts to erect counter batteries in these enclosures, and generally pay the penalty. They were hard at work at one of these batteries the other day, and like Idiots had blooked up every entrance but one. Twenty of our riflemen rushed in at this door, where, upaon Pandy fled like a flock of sheep Into a corner, and commenced firing indiscriminately at the riflemen, but being too much flurried did little damage. On the approach of the bayonet they had the barefacedness to beg for mnercy. They might as well have begged for mercy of a Shylook, for in another moment 40 of them were lying pierced with bayonets. We have Sepoys hanged in our camp every ev eDnng, which I have no doubt will astonish some of the people at home. I think I hear a faint wail from Exeter-hall and the usual talk of European brutaity and torture on the mild Eindoo Sepoy. If you hear any such sentiments by all meoan ship off their propounder to this country at once. Let him see one-half of what we have seen, and compare our brutality with theirs, then send him home again, and I think you will find him pretty quiet on the subject for the rest of his life. Thank goodness they seldom get hold of any of our wounded, but woe betide the unfortunate when they do. I myself had a narrow escape a few mornings ago. I had received orders to pro. pare a survey of the ground as close up to the walls as posdble, and for this purpose had crept up not very far from them to 'Ludlow Castle,' where poor Mr. Simon Fraser lived. I had finished my pacing and taken my angles, and was looking round me at the desolation when I heard an explosion behind me, and instantly saw the ground ploughed up either with canister shot or shrapneL I took the hint and walked off leisurely, little dreaming of the truth. I even repaced a distane I was not sura of. I was just outside the gate of Sir T. Metcalfe's grounds when I heard a horseman galloping about inside them. As I was a good deal in adrance of our pickets, and not very sure of my friend on horseback, I crapt behind a bush, and never felt more thankful for a revolver I had borrowed for the occasion. The horseman, after prancing backwards and forwards for some time out of xly sight, maoved off, and on my return to cXnp, to the ustonishment of everybody, I learned what an escape I hd had. " Pandy had seen me from the walls, and had tken the trouble to send out 50 horsemen (rather hard, 50 to 1 !) to catch me. The horsemen had been seen from our rlght battery, who know of my whereabouts, and immediately sent word to our centre battery, which opened fire on the cavalry and savedme, onlyone of the ruffians having had the pluck to continue the search." THE MUTINY AT SEALCOTE. The following is from an officer in the civil servce "Sealoote, July 23. "Here I am, all safe, and esoaped from that hot, drty hole, the fort, residing once again in cantomnents, in the married barracks of Her Majestys 52d Light Infantry, who lately marched from here. In my last letter I did not tell you half the story of the mutiny, and I shall not attempt to give you much more than what immediately concerned myself. It broke out by some of the cavalry riding into the infantry's lines about 4.30 a.m., and telling them there was to be a disturbance, and they had better get ready. They then flew to their bells of arms, and ceommenced firing volleys at the officers as they rode down to ace what the row was. Some officers whom they disliked they pursued, but they must have fired intentionally over the heads of most of them, or none could have escaped. The cavalry were much more murderous. The ringleaders among them ptmmoed every European they saw, even up to the walls of the fort, where Captain Bishop, one of the infantry officers, was pistoUed by a trooper. They also kiled several natives sgainst whom they had a spite. The escapes that people had to relate are past romance. Captain Saunders, Dr. Butler, and Dr. Garrad, with 13 of their children and their wives, lay hid in a coalhole a few feet square from 5 a.m. tiU 6 p.m. This hole was one of three adjoining outhouses, two of which the murderers broke open as they went about the compound lookiug for them. They had to gag their children to prevent noise. The heat nearly killed them, and we all gave them up till they came down to the fort In the evening. The troopers asking where they were, one man who peeped in at the keyhole they shot with a revolver through the head. A gun had been left in the station to fire at various times; thls these wretches got hold of and mounted on a carriage drawn by 16 buUooks, and coolly fired it at 12 o'clock just as if nothing had happened. When the row began the Grenadler company took their captain (Caulfield) and the colonel of the regiment (Farquharson) and pushed them into one of their native huts and stood guard over the door, talking to them and promisdng to protect them and take them to the fort in the evening. After some time nearly the whole regiment got about them and asked them to lead them, promising them respectively 2,000 and 1,000 rupees per month, promising to march to pleasant stations, and to go to the hlls every hot weather. This one fact ought to be enough for those who lay the blame of these affairs on the officers ; no one does out here. The cause is to be found in the annexation of Oude, which set all the high Mussulman families bitterly against us, in certain small grievances about penslons, the introduction of Goorkhas and Sikhs, &c., into our regiments, and the general .ntipathy which exists more or less among the higher orders to a white face. "I will now detail what we saw and did in the fort We mustered a pretty large number of Europeans, loads of ladies and children. For aid we had some of our foot police corps and 300 new Sikh levies. We thrw up an earthwork on the approach to the gate to prevent its being blown open by the guns, served out muskets and ammunition, and manned the bastions-no time to eat, and a burning sun over us. We then awaited anything they might please to do. Presently we saw detachments of infantry and cavalry release 350 ruffians from the gaol, who immediately set to work plundering and murdering, commencing their work by setting fire to our beautiful cutcherry, which is destroyed with all the valuable documents there were in it. Then they plundered our treasury there of 14,000r., the police guards in both places tacitly joining them. The native commanders of both the horse and foot had been talked over. The troops then divided out 35,000r. whioh had been committed to them to keep, then burnt down the market-place and town, blew up two large magazines (these explosions were among the finest sights I ever witnessed), and finally set to work plunderlng the houses. About 4 p.m., instead of attackdng us, they got all the horses, buggies, and carriages they could find, and put their plunder into them, and moved slowly off, marching about nine miles that night towards the Ravee rlver. We kept watch aU night, being told off to each bastion. I was not the least affected by the sleeping In the op3n air and watch beyond a little cold; indeed, the relief of having the thing over, and the removal of tho sus. pence, made me feel wonderfaUy well. When the troops went viUlagers poured by thousands into cantonments, and destroyed or plundered everything. Every one, from highest to lowest, has lost his al, or nearly so. The damage done to this beautiful station is inoonceivable. Next day a party of our levies marched up and bayonetted and shot 14 or 15 on the spot, and drove the rest out. The mischief, however, had been done. We did not relax our guarding measures, as they might return at any moment, and 200 men from the Jhelum district were known to have escaped. They are now imprisoned-caught by Gholab Singh's pcople in Cashmere. "He thus far seems to stand wvith us. Our foot police stood by us aU through the affair, except the wretch in command of them. The mounted police all went bad, and instead of aiding to escort us to the fort helped to plunder, and did not strike a blow. The mutiny took place on the 9th. On the 11th came commissioners from Lahore, Captain Lawrence, brother of Sir John, and one more. They nvestigated the affair, and hung the head man of the gaol and the commardera of the foot and horse police. I had no taste for an execution, so I did not go to see it. It was a very ticklish affair. as we were hanging Sikhs when we had only Sikh levies about us. The ropes broke, and the guard was ordered to shoot the half lifeless bodies; then folowed three or four voleys of musketry. Those not looking on tohught that it was 'all up,' and that the guard had turned upon us. I never felt so alarmed all through the affair. Of course it was all explained when we heard the fact. Lots of servants who went away with the mnutineers have been punished. In one day we had to flog 125 men-40 lashes each. We have some to hang every day-from one to six in number. A party of our levies havo gone out, and are get. ting the 600 prisoners from Gholab Singh's territory, and shooting or flogging them on the spot, as the case may be, I shall be very glad when al this shooting and hag- ing is over; it sets poople's minds moe ore lesa against us, and keeps us all in a state of excitement. We have now left the fort, and are all in one barrack with our levies round us. Yesterday we had two natives shot most mysteriously close by us; they were bringing in some plundered property in a cart. We cannot disoover how it was done, though we all turned out armed to look for the men who fired the shot. We did not know if it was not the beginning of a general rlsing. The Sikhs have behaved well hitherto, but I assure you the treachery, ingratitude, and cold-blooded cruelty we have witnes3ed and seen every day have more or less unrettled the minds of all, and made us mistrust everybody with a black face. If we are preserved through all this I dare say I sball have benefited by it, and seen a good deal of human nature which may be of use afterwards, Such experience, however, has beendearlypurchased. ' July 25. "The hanging and flogging still go on. Yesterday 120 servants of people in the station, who had bolted wlth the mutineers, came in under a guard. Our new levy now re ceiving the prisoners from Cashmere shot 78 the day before yesterday, and are keeping the native officers to be shot in here, to make an impresion. We have a hard day's work before us again to-day. for another batch have come in | They are nearly all 'down-easters,' as we In the Punjab call them-i. e., men of the North-West Provinces. These the Sikhs hate, and cordially approve our severe measures. We are all in good spiritsg messIng together in little parties, and loolding for the fal of Delhi. This, however, seems more distaub day by day. Rain now fails about every two days, and wll1 so oontinue to the end of September. It gets very hot just before the showers.

Let us only hear that Delhi has fallen, and I think we should have littis cause to fear." THE DISASTER AT ARRAH. P^Atna, July 31. "I thank God that I am alive and wllU and able to write to you once more. I havo been in great danger, and never expected to reach this place live again, but God has bean most merciful to me. A I dare ay you would like to hear the whole storyw I ll begin at the begining. About a week ago, as we have long anticipated, the three native regiments at Dinaporemutinied. The General, an old man In his second childhood, managed the whole affair verjg badly, or rather did nothing at all. No one knew who wa in commanud of the Europems, no one knew whom t, look to for orders, the General was not to be found, and the consequence was that the three regiments managed to get clear off with their arms and am. munition, and almost without loing a single man The General was advised and asked to seud men after them. but this he altogether declined to do, and determined tX keep every European in Dinapore, to take good care of him. self. A day or so after the mutineers left we heard ths they had gone to Arrah, where they were attacking poo Wake and party, condsting of about 12 or S3 Europeanu aud 50 Sikhs. Wake had strongly fortified a puckha house, and laid In lets of ammunition and food. Directly we heard of this, and that they were holding out well, Mr. - wrote to the General to send out aid to them. At first he refused, but after recelving a strong letter from Mr. -he con. sented, and sent off 200 Europeans in a steamer. The next day we heard that the steamer had stuck in the river, and that the General had sent orders to recal them. Of couTse, as Englishmen, we were In a great rage at this,-leaving a number of poor fellows to itheir fate; so off- and I started at 12 o'clock at night on Tuesday last to pitch into the old muff. When we got to Dinapore we found that he had been made to change his mind, and had consented to send anothersteameroff, which luckily happenedjustto have come in. In this started 150 Europeans and 50 Sikhs ; we altogether made up a forces of 400 men. As Wake Is one of the greatest friends I have got, I determined to give him a hand it I could, and so volunteered with seven other fellows, five of whom are dead. Well, I was up all that Tuesday night, and at daylight on Wednesday off we started. Wo reached he nearest point to Arrah, on the banks of the Ganges, at about 2 o'dock, and were beginning to get dinner ready (so as to start with a good feed, as we could not expect to get anything on the road) when we heard our advanced guard firing. We immediately all fell In, and went off to tha place, about two nliles off, where we found them dravn up before a large nullah (river) about 200 yards wlde, firing away at some Sepoys on the other side. The Sepoys, when they saw us coming, ran away; and then, as we had got so far, we thought we might as well go on. After a deiay of two or three hours in getting boats and crossing over it was nearly 7 o'clock before we got well off. From the villagers we heard that Wake was sti all right and holding out, which was conftrmei by the firing we heard in the direction of AnrAh of big guns. It was a beautiful moonlight night, the road ak very bad one (a kutcha one in the rains), and wooded country on both sides of us. We did not see a soul on the road, though we passed through several villages, until we came to within five miles of ArrAh, where we sw a party of horsemen ahead of us, who galloped off before we got within shot. About 11 o'Clock the moon went down ; however, as we did not expect that the mutineers would face us, we still went on til we came within abut a mile of the fortified house. We were passing a thick black mango grove to our right, when all of a sudden, without any warning, the whole place was lighted up by a tremendous volley poured into us at about 30 or 40 yards distance. It is Impossible to say how many men fired into us,-some say 500, some 1,500 The next thing I remember was finding myself alone, lying in the middle of the road, with acrack on the head, and my hat gone. I sappose I must have been stunned for a minute. When I recovered there were several men lying by me, but not a living Eoul could I see. There were lots to hear, though, for the bullets from right to left were whistling over my hed. I was just thinking where our men could be, and which way I should run, when I saw the Sepoys advancing out of the grove with their bayonets within a dozen yards of me. I fired my double barrel right and left into them and then ran towardg our men, whom I could hear shouting on the left, under a tremendous fire from both pades. Everything now was in a mosS dreadful confusion; the men were all scattered in groups of fifties and twenties, firing in every direction, and, I fear, killing each other. At last a Captain Jones, a very fine fellow-our commander was never seen again afer the first volley-got hold of a bugler and got the men tegether in a sort of hollow place, a half-filled pond. There we all ay down in a Equare. I was in the middle, with the doctor, helping him to tie up the wounds of the poor fellows, and bringing them water. The firing was all this time going on The enemy could see us, as we were all dressed in whiter while they were nearly naked, aud behind trees 'and wahls However, the rmen fired about at random. At last the poo doctor was knocked over, badly wounded. It was dreadfai to hear the poor wounded fellows asldng for help. " I shall never forget that night as long as I live. We held a consultation, and determined to retreat, as the enemy was at least 3,000 or 4,000 strong, and had, besides, several cannon. Directly morning dawned we formed order, and began our retreat. The whole distance, 16 miles, we walked under a most tremendous fire; the ditches, the jumgles, the houses, and, in fact, every place of cover along the road was lined with Sepoys. We kept up a fire as we went along, but what could we do ? We could see no enemy, only puffs of smoke. We tried to charge, but there was nobody to charge; on all sides they fixed into us, and were scattered all over the country in groups of tens and twenties. Dozens of poor fellows were knocked over within a yard of me on my right and left, but, thauk God, I escaped in the most wonderful way. The last five miles cf the road I carried a poor wounded fellow, who begged me not to leave hlm, and though we had had nothing to eat for more than 24 hours, and I had had no sleep for two nights, I never felt so strong in my life, and I stepped out with the man as if he had been a feather, though he was as big as myself. Poor fellow! the men, most of them more or less wounded, were leaving him behind, and the cowardly Sepoys, who never cama within 200 yards of us, were running up to murder him. I got the poor fellow safe over the nullab; I swam out and got a boat, put him in, and went over with a lot of others. The poor fellow thanked me with tears in his eyes. At the crossing of the nullah we lost a great many men; they thre v away their muskets to pull the boats and to swim over, and were shot down like sheep. " I never before knew the horrors of war, and what I have gone through I hope will make a lasting impression orL my mind, and make me think more of God and Hlis gre.t goodness to me. I am sure God spared me because He knew Iwas not fit to die; and I pray God that He will prepare me, for we can truly say we know not what a day may bring forth. I had several extraordinary escapes, one bullet went between my legs as I was walking and broke a man's leg in front of me; another bullet hit me on the back of the head, knooldngme down buthardlybreakingthe skin. Everything here is quiet as yet, but people are in a great panim. I cannot say thab I am. Out of the 400 fine fellows that started for Arrah, nearly 200 were kiled, and of the re. mainder I do not thlnk more than 50 to 80 were not wounded; out of seven volunteers five were knocked over, four kiled and one wounded. This has been the most disastrous affair that has happened out here. I hope, however, we may soon get some more troops again from Cal. cutta, and get back our name. I cry to think of the way we were beaten and of the number of poor feUows who were kiUed. I will send this letter at once, for perhaps the dak may be stopped, and I may not be able to send a letter u a day or two. I will vite again if I can, but do not be alarmed if I do not. The crack on niy head hardly broke the skin, and is nothing; the bullet hit me sideways, and the folds of cloth I had round my hat saved me. August 1. "I havo just hoard that about 30 men came in last night who got separated from us in the dark, and wandered to the river, where they got offin a native boat. The authentic re. turn I have just seen; 150 men killed, the rest woundel, except about 50 men who escaped untouched. I suppose Ruch a disastrous afir was never heard of before in Indiamost dreadful mismanagement throughout. Of course we did not relieve poor Wake and his garrison.

The following letter is from Lieutenant Robertson, of the 7th Bengal Native Infantry:- " Dinapore, August L "I write in great haste to save the maiL The three Xative Infantry regiments here mutinled on the 25th of last month; between 2 and 3 o'clock p.m. of that day they broke Into an open tate of mutiny, firing at their offioers and at every European who appeared. The guns and Europeans (10th Queen's) were immediately brought to bear upon them, butimmediately the fire opened he rascals made off. We burnt down some villages and the native bazaar. Many of us had narrow scapes, but not an officer was tonched; many bullets fell close to where I and some others were standing. We have had several expeditions after them since then. A steamer was sent up to cut them off from Arrah (a station 24 inles from this whither they had gone to). I went in It, but we didi not come across them. A body of the 10th, with some volunteers (myself among the number) went out next morning, but wMth equal bad luck. I have now the worst news to give you, the account of a serious defeat which we have recei'ved, thus-on the evening of the 29th a body of Euro. peans, consisting of detachmenta of the Queen's 10th and 37th. Regiments, and a number of volunteers, stared by steamer to within 14 miles of Arrab, when they disembarked and marched on Arrah. When within a mile of the station they were attacked (12 at night) by the mutineers in force, compelled to retreat with the loss of nearly all their' offlcers And half of the men to the steamer, which they.

" We are in a very awkward position here, intrenching ourselves, and anxiously looking out for reinforcements. All the Europeans have come in from the surrounding stations, and the place is actually crammed. The women and children are just starting for Calcutta by steamer. You cannot imagine the excitement and confusion prevailing. " Troops have been sent to Patna, and we only have 203 Europeans of the 10th for the protection of the station. " The 90th (Queen's) is expected from Calcutta in a few days, and as soon as they come we shall be safe enough. Things have been dreadfully mismanaged here, and if we don't look out we shall lose the country; but we must hope for the best. " P.S. As soon as the Europeans come up from Calcutta we shal be all right. The 12th Irregular Cavaiy 1have mutinied in Tirhoot, and killed their commanding officer, Major Holmes, his wife, and the doctor."

AGRA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.

POSTAL CO CATION B=wrEW GIcAT BRITAL-T AN-D BELG1TJrL-An important 2nodification of the postal relations between the united kingdom and Belgium wil come into effect on the 1st proximo. Eitherto the postage charge on letters has been 6d.for onenot exceeding a quarter of an ounce, and 8d. for one not exceeding half an ounce. Prepayment was optional, but on and after the 1st of Oetober the letter rate up to half an ounce will be 4d. Unless, however, there be prepayment, the postage will be double. At the present time the transmission of printed matter oth.r than newspapers between the two countries is almost impracticable in consequence of its being charged at the letter rate, but from the 1st of next month printed matter as well as newspapers are to be conveyed between each country on a prepayment of Id. per package not exceoding 60 grammes, which is equivalent to one ounce and twothirds. This about doubles the present postal charge upon newspapers received in this country, and imposes a new, and in the case of the large papers a very heavy postal tax upon all those sent out from Great Britain, masmuch as since the Newspaper Stamp Act of 1805 all newspapers sent hence to Belgium are exempt eitber from the impressed or the penny postage stamps. SUICIDF. AND INCEND BISM.is .-An act of self. destruction, accompanied by three atsrnpts to dotroy v rectory-house by fire, took place in the village of Bradford Peverell, about two miles from Dorchester, on Saturday last. Just before 6 o'clock that morning the deceased, named William Howe, and serving-man to the [1ev. Blackstor,e Williams, Rector of Bradford Poverell, snd high sheriff's chaplain, was heard to go up to his room by one of the servants, and shortly afterwards she remarked a sia. gular smell of smoke. On descending she found the lower part of the reory and the staircase were on fire, and at once communicated with her master. The Rev. Mr. Williams immediately ran to the nursery and saved his children, and the household was almost instantly astir. It was observed, however, that Howe was not about, and Mr. Williams thereupon went to his room, and after getting no reply to repeated calls the rev. gentleman entered deceased's bed-room, and found the unfortunate man lying motionless on the floor, with his face do wnwards, and a dis. charged gun beneath him. He called to a man named Bartlett to assist Howe, and then went to rescuo Ms. Williams, who, owing to the heat of the staircase and the smoke, was hardly able to effect an escape. Mr. Williams then returned to deceased's room, and found him attempting to cut his throat with a razor, and the rev. gentleman managed to get possessien of the razor and to throw it away when Howe feU upon the floor as if dead. It was found that by means of heaps of candle-ends, straw, empty casks, and portions of wall being bared to the lath, preparations which must have occupied hours for their consummation, the house was in a most dangerous condition. However, the Rev, Mr. Williams made his way again to deceased's room when he found the man on his feet hacking at his throat with another razor, the existence of which was unknown to the rev. gentleman, and the man bleeding profusely, almost immediately after expiring. No causa for the committal of these deeds has been assigned. Howe always bore a good character for honesty and attention to his duties, and up to bedtime the previous night had, as usual, waited upon his master. The appearance of deceased's bed, however, the clothes of which were undisturbed, showed that he had not been to bed all night, and he was dressed as on the preceding evening. Although no report of firearms was heard by any of the inmates of the rectory it is beUeved death ensued from bullets whichhad penetrated the body. The unfortunate man, at his own request, was just on the point of leaving Mr. Williams's service, whence he intended to enter the police foroe at Bristol, and afterwards to get marrled. An inquest was held the same day before the dis. trict coroner, Mr. Giles Symonds, and the jury returned a verdict of "F Felo de se." The body was interred at mid,. IPightI
TRE UNITED STATES. (TRow ov3 owN 0ORRoBMDK1M.1 NEW YORK, Srr.8, 1857. The cool nights and moderate days are driving people from the watering-places, and town once more begins to look gay. The inertia of thu zummer still hangs over everythlng, yielding little matter of interest ;I but, if town fills up for the next ten days as rapidly as it has during the past ten, we may, in the language of almanac makers, " look out for something squally" before long. With unsettled troubles in Central America, a quarrel almost brought to a head with Venezuela a periodical batch of "c laims" against Mexico, and an increasing quarrel between North and South about Kansas, the Prerident will soon have his Bands flMl, while the general want of confidence in tbe financial world will continue to keep the troubled waters very muddy in those quarters. The only circumstance that seems to afford no discontent and promise no trouble is the great crop of the West, which is now either insured or actually harvested. Daring theweek the President has in advance put forth his manifesto as to Kansas. Several well-intentionod persons in Connecticut wrote him a letter, telling him in a polite way that he was very naughty for allowing Governor Walker to use the troops to put down the Lawrence paper rebellion, and arraigning other acts of his adminiitration. The President thought it ncessay to meet this arraignment of his administration, and replied in a letter which has attracted a great deal of attention in political circles. He says that he found the present territorial laws in force 'when he entered on the duties of his office-created by a body recognized by his predecessor and by Congress, and enforced by the preceding Administrtion. There were no other laws then exlsting in the territory, and no opposition to these laws, except from persons declared to be in rebellion. He then argues that he was bound-that no other course was open to him but to recognize these laws as the starting point for all changes in the government of the territory- that, adoptin them as a basis, on them he would build up, or lend the federal aid to build up, a just system, impartial to both parties, which should permit the public wfll to have free expression, and that expression to become law, The expresion so obtained shall, he declares, be enforced. The constitution that may be framed sball be submitted for ratification by the voters insenbed under the territorial law, and when ratified will be the only fundamental law recognized by the Central Government. The position of the Administration being thus explicitly defined In advance, the Opposition have the political advantage of picking it to pieces before Congrem come together-such as that advantage is. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has been engaged for some time past in the negotiations for terminating the difficulties with the State of Panama, or rather with the Republic of New Granada. A negotiation with a Spaniard is proverbially long. Add to the Castillian blood a tincture of the Indian, with an occasional dash of -he Negro, and matters are not shortened much. The negotiations still linger, I think, notwithstanding what is said in some of the morning journals to the contrary ; though with a prospect that on some of the points in dispute they will be brought to a speedy and amicable termination. As to others, however, that have more of a political bearing than the amount of damages to be paid to this or that injured passenger, I question whether the Cabinet will feel disposed to take the responsibility of settling them before the meeting of Congress, if, indeed, they are ever entirely settled. The troubles with Venezuela are also growing more complicated. A company of speculators 'was formed for the shipment of guano from a derelict island, discovered and taken possession of by Americans sailing under the flag of the United St-ates. The republic of Venezuela claimed jurisdiction of this island, ousted the company, and sold the exclusive right to take the guano to another company. The interference of the United States has been invoked on behalf of the first company. A statute has been enacted by Congress recognizxna the principle of jurisdiction over such derelict islands discovered by the merchant service, and a great deal of correspondence has taken place between the representatives of the two Governments concerning the claim. Pending the discsion M!r. Eames, the American Minister to Venezuela, has visited Washington, and now returns with fresh instructions more definite than thote under which he has hitherto acted. We had this week a taste of what the Atlantic telegraph may be. The Arago's news was caught at Cape flace by a fishing smack, and sent on to New York over the wires two days in advance of her arrival here. This is the first time that this thing has been accomplished here; nor can it be counted upon often. It is only during a part of the year that tlke vessels approach near enough to Cape Race to make it practicable, and even then almost constant fogs that hang around that point would make the thing impraeticable. To-day has again been a low price day in the stock-market. The bank lines are, unaccountably to me, regarded unfavourably in " the street." The official averages show the following changes on those of last week:- Decrease In loans sad discounts ... $4,367,454 InCreaso in specie ... ... 986,589 Decr}e in undrawn deposits ... 3,600,693 The decrease in loans is made larger than it would otherwise have been by about $1,100,000 by the failure of a small bank, yet, even with this allowance, the curtailment amounts to between M6,000M000 and $7,000,000 in a fortnight, with a panic prevailing. The withdra-wal of the deposits seems to have partly supplied the deficiency with the public. The increase in specie is less than was anticipated, none having gone out during the week, and nearly $2,000,000 having been received from California and the Havannab. A few provision houses have gone down since my last letter, but with that exception I do not learn that the existing rates for money and want of confidence have done serious damage. All persons interested in railways are looking for the action of the shareholders of Michigan Southern, which has been called to elect a new board of directors. There is much feeling on the subject. The subscriptions for the new fourth mortgage of the Erie progress slowly. Holders of convertibles here are waiting the action on the other side. The banks came forward last week to the relief of the company to the amount of $600, 000, for which the new bonds are pledged as collateral security. The new move of the Illinois Central Company has been sharply criticised bypersons interested in the shares. I was surprised to see it so sharply noticed in Conservative quarters. I thought it only an act of justice to the bondholders, by whose capital the road was principally constructed, to increase the share capital. The tendency in American railway construction is tho other rway,.-.o e.rddlo ff suno,U 0iinxo ec.pi~il rr a heavy bonded capital, that eventually crushes it. MIr.

ANEsTHTrIc SuBsTAiCES.-Our readers may recollect that a few months ago amylene was recommended as preferable to ether and chloroform in producing stupefaction or anzesthesia, on the special ground that its employ-ment was unattended with danger to the patient, or nearly so. ME Foucher and Bonnet have, however, in a recent communication, addressed to the Academy of Sciences, recorded facts leading to quite a contrary result. In 12experiments performed on rabbits they have ascertained that the antesthetic effect of amyzene is produced within three and six minutes after its application. Before stupefaction Is pro. duced the aDimal utters piercing cries and throws its head backwards; its breathing is accelerated, the globe of the eye is strongly injected and moves convulsively; a tracheal hoaereness always accomp.aying the above symptoms. The period of insensibility does not last long if the application of amylenebe not continued; in the contrary case, however, a complete collapse takes place; the animal, stretched out without motion, obeys every impulse of the hand, and re. aemblesa flabby mass in which breathingishardly perceptible. This state may last 20 minutes without causing death. The blood drawn from the arteries during this period still preservea its usual colour. Animals subjected to the action of amylene for a certain length of time continue after the operation in a state of stcpor and imbecility, which sometimes lasts seven or eight hours; but in none of the cases observed by the authors of the oommunication has death foliowed the application of amylone. The conclusions resulting from their experiments are as follow :-1. Sulphuric ether, chloroform, and amylene are, of all volatile substances experimented on, the only ones that produce anaesthegia. 2. Amyleno does not produce stupefaction unless the quiautity of iir with which It is diluted be very small; but then it acts upon the animal economy, and especially upon the respiratory organs in a manner which may produce damgerous effects. 3. Chloroform has all the advantages of amylene, without the evils which acoompany the use of the latter. 4. None of the substances above-mentioned produce anteethesla, whether local or general, when applied to any peculiar part of the body by injection under the skin.-fUaignani's 3fcssenger Cnysr.r, PATLACe.-OxE Sftn mG DAY MonI day, Sept. 2L-Admisdons on payment, 6,403; 3dtto, by Lason tiokotz, 334; tobl vidtora5 6,73T.
TEg FBENCH FOREIGN LEGIO2. In considering the formation of a Foreign Legloea. it may be interesting to pre the follow,ng Bketch 4 f the French Foreigt =-.I, held so highly IiJ* sOteem by that nation "In 1815, immedIately after tho Restoration, numbers of Italians who had sersed under Napoleon found their way to Fhnce In order to enrol themselves in the French army They were formed into a corps, the organization of which Ws intrustod to an offioer named Hohenlohe, from whom the corps took the name under which it served in the occu. paticn of the M1orea. " After the revolution of July, 1850, this oorps ,which ha become reduced in numbers, waa by Louis PhDippe incor. porated in the French army as the 21st Regiment of Light Infantry (now the 96th Regiment of the Line). I" In 1831 it was thought desirable to raise anotherforeign corps for the purpose of being sentto Algeria. It was composed of many battalions of various nations, among other there was a Belgian and likewise Gernan and Italian IAt. talions. This formation, however, was not found successful, and therefore from time to time as reinforoementa of recruits arrived from Frano the arious nattons were gradual intermixed. Yet this was not thoroughly effectie mtil 1839. At the engagement of the Pont de 1A Machta one of these bhttalions was cut to pieces by the enemy, owing, it is sad, to a bad -prs-t which extsted in one of the battsltons. I n 1835 these troops were given over to Queen ChrltlnA of Spain, to fight aginst Don Carlos. They served under Generals Bernell and Conrad, and after the death of the latter they were oommanded by Colonel Ferrari, a Neapolitan, who had served many years in the Napoleontim army. Durlng this civil war in the Penins they pe. formed many glant deeds, and Itis very worthy of remark that during a period of 18 months, during which they received neither pay nor rations, not the sllghte&t per. ception of discontent prevailed. " In the year 1838 these foreign battelions, afer having suffered extremely, were reduced in all to about 400 or 500 men; these were ordered to cross the Pyrenese to Pau and Perpignan, where they then became the nuclei for the formation of two regiments of three battalions each. On this new formation it was deemod adviable to entirely amalgas mate the men of the different nations about to compose the force. Two-thirdsat leat of the officers were to b French. men, and a certain portion of the non-oommisioned offioers were, on the commencement of the organization, likewise to be Frenchmen. The corps was again destined to serve in Algeria, where previously it had rendered such great services, and in 1839 it proceeded there. It distinguished itself during the second expedition to Constantine, at the storming of which place it behaved admirably. It was on this occasion that St. Arnaud was promoted to the rank of Captain, and was decorated, and remarked that he owed both to the bravery of these foreign soldiers. This force took a part in nearly every engagement in the Algerian campaign. In 1849, at the storming of Zaatcha, Its flank companies, under the command of 3Meyer, a Swiss, sin. gularly distinguished themselves in leading the forlorn hope. " In 1852 the 1st regLment was prased in a general order for its very admirable conduct at rOuadE3ss, under General Montauban. "In Algeria, where all public works and roads are made by the troops, the Engineers' officers always solicit working parties from the Foreign Leon, on accont of their wfliingnem and disposition. "a rshal Pelissier, when commanding in Algerla, placed mere dependence in tho Foreign Legion than in Any other troops under his command. In 1854 the corps was sent to the Crimea. The charge made by it at the Alma, and its very heroio behavionr at the taking of the Mamelon, together with its remarkable patience nd endurance during the entire winter of 1854, caused its fame to become more established than before. On the 10th of May, 1856, Napoleon III. offered naturalization to all serving in it. Those who accepted were transferred to the regiments they selected in the regular force, while the remainder formed a nucleus for its present formation, v,hich took place in 1856, and pro, ceeded once more to occopy Algeria. Its force is about 6,300, and it is composed in round numbers of the following nations, intermixed and divided into battalions:- Germans ... ... ... ... 1,000 Swiss ... ... . 2,500 Italans ... ... ... ... 600 Spaniards ... ... .. ... 700 Dutch ... ... .. . 300 Belgians ... ... ... ... 1,200 Total ... ... 6,300 "It is now serving under Marshal Randon, and only very lately since its new formation has added to his former glories. After a forced march the French foroes arrived at the place they were to attack in such an exhausted state that the Zouaves refused to attack, on which the flank companies of the Foreign Legion at onoe volunteerod to carry the works under a very sharp fire, which they did. "Subjoined are the names of a few general officers who have risen to eminence of late, and who served in the French Foreign Legion:- " Marshal St. Arnaud.-Entered the service in the Foreign Legion as lieutenant from half-pay, and did not leave it until he attained the rank of major. " General M'dMahon.-Commanded the 2d Regiment of tha Foreign Legion. " General Bedeau.-Commanded the 1st Regiment of the Foreign Legion. "General Neumayer.-Ditto. "General Carbuccia, who died in the Crimea, served many years in the Foreign Legion. "G GeneralBamaine, who commanded the French and English troops at the expedition to Klnburn, 1855, and was after. wards Governor of Sebostopol, enlisted as a private in the Foreign Legion in 1831, and rose regularly in that corps until he arrived in the Crimea in command of its 1st Regiment, vhen he was given the command of the entire Foreign Brigade. "General Mellinet.-NTow commanding the French Imperial Guards; served for seven years in the Foreign Legion. " General Vinoy.-Commands one of the Brigade of tho Gardo Imp6riale, and served many years in the Foreign Legion. "General Changarnier.-Served as captain and major in the Foreign Legion. " General Charras.-Served as major and lieutenant-colonel in the Foreign Legion."
THE VICTORIA R}IFLES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Will you kindly permit me, through the medium of your columns, to correct an impression which is gaining ground, that the " Victoria Bidles," a Middleses volunteer corps, is simply a club of gentlemen, not sanctioned by Government ? Such an impression to a great extent frustrates the exertions of thoso who are endeavouring to raise the corps to its full complement. I therefore wish to stata in contradiction, that the " Victoria RdIle Corps" is enrolled under the direct sanction of Her Majesty, with tbe approval also of Lord Palmerston. The corps is governed by the Volunteer Act, is entirely self-supporting, and is, I believe, tho orly volunteer rifle corps, excepting the South Devon, whose officers' names appear in the Army Lis. Ten of its members havo rnAA -1 - Ii-tu n varioub asileta regiments, one was gazetted direct froa its ranks as Paymaster in the German Legion, and two are now fighting in India as officers in Her Majesty's 60th Rifles.

TO TH.3 EDITOB OF THE TIMfES. Slr,-I read with considerable interest and satisfaction a letter signed "P." in Ths Times of Friday, on the subject of the present lameutable revo't in India. I concur generally in the opiihi .nmi ex-! pressed by the writer, and I would not have asked for a small space in your valuable columnfs htit for a curious oversight in the letter oE "; P.," not to have been anticipated from onevvho manifests coinsiderable knowvledgeof Indian affairsand native cbara.t *r. Iam glad, however, that the circumstance gives iue the opportunity of recalling public attention to facts and words of deep Import of the date of half a century gone by-facts and words which unhappily proved abortive in teaching a lesson for the future. in his concluding paragraph " P." says- ' The present revolt is s,ui generis. There Is nothing like it in history to furnish a beacon to guide us out of the dffloulty, because there never was a State which rested for support upon such an army " So says " P.," but what says the Annio. d, Register for 1806, and Mr. WlUberforce in 1813? Before quotation, however, I may premise that the Madras army at that time w-s commanded by Genet al Craddock, a martinet, utterly ignorant of the religious prejudices and feelings of the natives of India. To smarten the appearance of the Madras troops he ordered the Ilindoo Sepoys to remove from their foreheads the tilluck, or small wafer-like patch of paint, which they put daily on their foreheads to distinguish their caste; and generally the whole of the Sepoys, Hindoos, and Mahormedans were ordered to shave off their whiskers, and to wear a new cap which had some distant resemblance to a Christian's hat. A burst of indignation ross throughout the army, and multinous indications took place at several stations, but at one place only did it come to revolt and massacre. The fortress of Vellore, where the sons of Tippoo Sultan were kept prisoners, was gsrrisoned by four companies of the Royal 69th and by two regiments of Sepoys. At 2 o'clock in the morning of the 10th of July, 1806, the Sepoys massacred 109 of the sleeping Europeans, together with their owrn officers. The example would no doubt have been followed elsewhere but for the promptitude of Gillespie in utterly cutting up the mutineers. How bloodshed was prevented at Hyderabad can best be shown In the worda of Mr. Wilberforce, in his place in the House of Commons in 3813, for which I am indebted to some unknown correspondent:- " In the case of the mutiny at Vellore coercive measures of the most aggravating description had been resorted to. In one instanoe a native regiment was broke; 19 individuals wroe tried, nd two were sentenced to receive 900 lashes each on their bare backs, and all this because they would not submit to the orders prohibiting them from wearing the distinctive marks of their caste while on duty, and requiring them to shave their whiscers and exchange their turbans for caps There was, therefore, no occasion to resort to the bypothesis of missionary attempts in order to explati the causes of this mutiny. The causes were sufficiently obvious. It would be recollected that even Peter the Great, who could do almost anything with his subjects, had reason to repent of having touched the beards of the Muscovites. The dis. turbances at H derabad equally proved what was the true nature of the eviL Here there were lO,OOOtroops who were| ordered toshave their whiskers. Thiscaused a strongsens%tion among them. They refused to comply with the order, nor could the commander find one native corps to stand by him, and at length he wlsely revoked the obnoxious order on his own responsibility. This at once allayed the tumul%, and the troops instantly rAturnod to their duty. AlU this tine the adherents of TiPpoo Sultan's family did all they could to increase the irritation of the troops. It therefore seemed hard that the missionaries, whose conduct had untformly been so prudent, should be charged with being the cause of these disturbances." So said Mr. Wilberforce, and we have only to substitute greased cartridges for the tilluck, or forehead mark, and the adherents of the Kings of Delhi and Oude for those of Tippoo Sultan, and we have an absolute parallelism between the mutinies of 1806 and 1857. The Annual Register for 1806 concludes its commenta upon the Vellore mutiny with these words, page 254:- * Such is the jealouwy of the natives, both nogsulmans and Gentoos, on the.subject of religion, that it requiros little spirit of prophecy to foresee that, unless cheeked in time (interference -with religion is alluded to), it will lead to the subversionf orr Indian Empire, and the nassacre of our countrymen disperged over that distant land." Alas! these terrible and prophetic words were wvritten o1 years ago, and we shudderinreflecting that a disregard or oblivion of their importance has involved half the families of England 'in anguish, despair, and mourning.

now TO FILL THE_ BRKS OF OUP A1,r TO TIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Allow me to add my testimony to that of " A Fiold Officer of Milittia" whose letter I haveread in your columns of this morning, as to the number of men easiy obtainable from the Militia by taking with them a larger proportion of officers. The regiment to which I belong, during the late war, volunteered almost to a man for service in the Crimea, if allowed to go in a body (for this we received the thanks of Government) ; yet, in spite of all due encouragement, the number of men furnished by us at the periodical visits of the recruiting officers of tho Line was inconsiderable. Why was this ? The men had become attached to their own officers ; their home was in their own regiment, not this or that regiment of the Line. The first object Is to obtain men ; but, Sir, I think something Is also dub to their officors, who are not content merely ro drill men for tbe Line.

She was 120 days out from Liverpool; 14 children and four adults died on the pasge, and one man immediately before landing.

THE OLD BEVGAL ARMY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,.-In The Timen of Saturday, the 12th of September last, there is a republication of a pamphlet by General Jacob, of the Bombay army, who has distinguished himself on several occasions as an able commander of a body of Irregular horse. I think that he was labouring under a mistake when he supposed himself well acquainted with the Bengal army, and, indeed, his pamphlet shows that he was strongly prejudiced against that force. General Jacob avoids naming any particular regiment; but in the 6th, 7th, and 8th paragraphs he dwells on the supposed evils of enlisting high caste Sepoys, the bad system of promotion, and the entire absence of proper discipline throughout the native part of the Bengal army. I served 24 years in the Bengal army without any intermission, and, in order to avoid nmeeting his unsupported assertions by a simple denial of his statements, I will refer to what I have personally ob. served in two native regiments as a most convincing proof that the Bengal army could not have been in the state ho describes. I confine myself to 'what came under my own immediate observation, though I have every reason to be. lieve that many other regiments were equally efficient, and I hope to prove that high caste has no necessary connexion with breach of discipline or neglect of the regulations of the Bengal army, but that when properly commanded, and with a suffioient number of aotive, zealous European officers, the Sepoy regiments were equal indiscipline and efficiency to any troops in the world. When Lord Wellesley sent a small army under Sir David Baird to reinforce the British troops In Egypt, a regiment of native volunteers from the Bengal army was formed near Calcutta, and two European officers were appointed to each company. After a very long voyage this regiment arrived at Jeddah, near Mecca, in the Red Sea, where the men were told that they would be detatined some time in order to replenish their stock of water. They were, however, so anxious to be engaged with the French army that they strongly urged a request to be put on half allowance of water, and to be permitted to proceed at once against the enemy. This pleaeed Sir David Baird, and he complied with their wishes. The little army landed at Kosseir, where water was very scarce, as the French had destroyed the wells. A considerable number of small wells bad to be dug l athe sand, and the labour was so irksome to the Europemn soldiers that the General, to encourage them, ordered working money to be issued to each regiment. When this allowance was offered to the Bengal Sepoys they said they were ready to execute ^ny work required of them by the General, but that the money payment would lower them to a level with hired labourers and they sent it back. Sir David Baird was much struck vith this elevated feeling. He requested to know what recompense they would prefer; and they replied that to be allowed always to take hlis own guard of headquarters would be a distinction that would fully remunerate them for any labour they could perform. During the arduous march through the Desert to Eenneh, on the Nile, while the offioers of European regiments had some difficulty in getting one tent pitched for themselves, the moment the Bengal Sepoys had pitched their own tents and were allowed to help their officers, each company contended which of them should first raise those of their own offliers, and thus the whole regiment was under canvass in an almost incredibly short time, and this was done daUy for nearly a week. When the Grand Army had field days near Alexandria it was usual for some regiment, selected for its steadiness under arms and skilful handling, to be named as a guide for the others in particular manceuvres, and so often was this honour conferred on the Bengal reglment that they becamo known by the nickname of "The Leadfing Corps." Indeed, so skilful had the regiment become that when the late Sir Samuel Auchmuty, then adjutant-general of the army, was ordered to inspect it, after puttiog it tl,rough some difficult mancouvres over very rough ground, he suddenly stopped, and said it was not necessary to do more, as he had never seen a more perfectly disciplined regiment. So far were they from refusing to work, that when the attempt was made to remove to England one of the obelisks known as Cleopatraes Needles the B.ngal regiment every week took its share in the work of forming a causeway to the sea. At that time tha Mamelukes were offering large bounties to our soldiers to join them, and this occasioned many desertions among the Europeans. Sir David Baird told the Bengal regiment that he had so much confidence intheir loyalty that he would put them on duty at all the outposts to stop this evil, and during the whole campaign not a man of them quitted his colours. This regiment, like all other Bengal corps of the Line, was c-omposed of Mahomedans and high caste Hindoos, ',ithout one of a lower order, and yet what corps ever went through more trials with mote credit to itself ? In the same army there were two Bombay regiments, the 2d battalions of the 1st and 7th Sepoys. They had been on board transports a much shorter time thanthose from BengaL They were generally low caste natives. They were seen to eat cattle that had died on the road, and their habits were very dirty. They landed at Kosseir in a very sickly state, and their physical strength was so low that it was deemed inexpedient to expose them to the arduous march across the Desert, and they remained some time in charge of Kosseir, without ever reaching Alexandria. I will now mention another Bengal native regiment, the 2d Battalion, 13th Regiment. Their commander, Sir Gabriel Martindale, was a man who delighted in his regi. ment. He was always present, and toek a particular pleasure in drilling the recruits himself. He invariably seleoted for promotion the soldiers who showed most activity and intelligence as drill instructors. The sergeants who were too old for active duties were invalided. Some who had done good service were rewarded with commissions, and all the native officers were always treated with respeot and klndness. Whenever they waited on the colonel they wero offered chairs, an attention they par. ticularly valued, and every month there was a kind of levee, which they liked to attend. No regiment could have been in a higher state of discpline and efficiency. Whon ordered on escort duties, which frequently occurred, they were re. quired to march 20 miles a-day with their full complement of bal eArtridges. When the protected provinces, near the Sutlej, were first occupied by ouir troops this regiment had a long march of many days from Muttra to Kurnaul, and on arriving at the latter place they were taken to a large wood, where they were told to encamp, aud in order to do this they had to cut down the trees and level the ground. Not a murmur was heard, nor any objection made. They went cheerfully to work, although so wild was the spot that 20 snakes were killed on the li#tle plot of ground allotted to my own tent. I think the foregoing shows that General Jacob did not know the Benal army. He also alleges that the native cavalry are composed of men of such high caste that they wil not groom their own horses. No person acquainted with the subject could have fallen into such a gross mistake. General Jacob ought to have known that the horses are highly bred and entire, and so inclined to fight that no trooper can lead a spare horse, as is done in Europe. The Government, thereforo, allow in every European regiment of cavalry one greom to two horses, and in'the native cavalry one for every three horses, to take care of the hoses of men in hospital, on guard, Or on leave of absence, but they have nothing to do with the horses of men present under arms. When the men dis. mount the horses are secured by fastening two long ropes from their hind legs to a large peg or picket behind, and +, M. .0 h-MA fMnl tLhbA6 haAdR to two nickat, in, t o-. In this position they are at liberty to lie down, but cannot turn round to fight or kick their neighbours. These pegs and ropes, on. a line of march, are carried by the grass. cutters, who supply the horses with fresh grass instead of hay. The regimentmentionedbyGeneralJacob was evidentlywait. ing for the arrival of the ropes and pegs, aud not, as he sup. posed, for the grooms to clean their horses. So far is this from being the practice, that in most cavalry reginents the European officers are not allowed to leave the stables or pickets until the feet of each horse have been examined to see that no nails are wanting nor any injury received. It is true that regiments badly commanded have mutiniedl but this does not occur in native regiments alone, and I .ould name mnore than one of Her Majesty's regiments which have dono the same. I was myself called upon to act against one regiment in Calcutta, which, after releasing met from the main guard prison, had fired some shots into its offices quarter. But these cases are exceptional, and do not affect the whole army. It is singular how often the several castes of EHindoos are confounded with those of Brahmins or priests. The latter make very sloveniy, bad soldiers, and there are but a few in each company, though It would be better to have none. But the Rajpoots, and RIohillas, with other high castes, are soldiers by profession, and have long been distinguished by their gallantry and soldier-lke qualities. They only require to be treated with great firmness, blended with kindness, and it is a great mistake to suppose that their high caste unfits them for soldiers. g Another prevailing mistake is to suppose that the Company's artillery is composed of natives, whereas, 'with the exception of a few companies, the whole is English, while in the Horse Artillery the drivers alone are natives. Hitherto the Bengal army has been recruited chiefly from Oude; but since we have acquired the Punjab, the banks of the Indus, and the mountain range inhabited by the Goorkhas, iGwin be very easy to obtan good soldiers from those districts. But it will be useless to look for well-dis. .iplined regiments unlesi they are properly commanded;' and that whenevery oompany has good officers, they are no longer taken away not only to fill staff situations but also for the formation of irregular corps, and diplomatic cr civil stationp. It does not yet appear to be well understd, efen in India, what has caused the late horrible conduot of the Bengal army. Hindoos, Mahomedans, and men fromn the Punjab have >U combined in the moat cruel and disgraceful oonduct-the Irregular corps, as well at the regulars. Hitherto, the large mass of the popu. lation have ahown how sensible they aro of the Eolid advantages they derive from British rule, and they are standing witnesses of the justice of our Govern, 3nent. Sir Thomas Munro many years ago predicted that a free native press would so work upon the feeling of the Sepoys that they would sooner or later emancipate themselves from all restraint, and we have now deplorable proofs of his Intimate knowledge of the charaoter of the men. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, P. PHIPPS, Colonel, Bengal Arniy. I
WATEB A1WD COOKING INTRAHSPOFW& TO THE EDITOR OF TiE TIMES. Sir,-In The Times of Wednesday, the 16th of July, is an extract from thWMel.bourne drgus, giving an account of a. hearing at the Williamstown Police-court resulting In a fine of 2331. g. 6d., or, in default of payment, three months' Imprisonment, im-posed on the master of the ship War Spirit, from Liverpool, for not having a sufficient supply of water on board his ship to allow of his issuing the daily quantity required by the Passengers' Act-viz., three quarts of pure water to each passenger, exclusive of that used for cooking purposes. The defence was "that the casks had leaked, and that the passengers were recessarily put on Ehort allowance on the o9th day of the voyage, and that In doing this the captain had exercised a sound discretionr; also that he condensed salt water to the amount of D0 gallons a-day, which the passengers might have used, but disliked it, as tasting of salt and lead, and would not use it, although It had been pronounced by the doctor to be wholesome." This decision may be very useful to the puble, but It also raises a very important question as to the comfort of our troops going out in the noble merchant skips which the Hon. East India Company have hired for them upon the consent of Government to allow the Admiralty to refuse to carry British troops-this, by the way, after the Royal Albert for England and the Napoleon for France were employed to carry each 1,000 men to Balaklava in 18S. I have been assured by a captain of a fine screw steamer that,after leaving the Chaunel,water enough was distiled on board his vessel to supply the whole ship's company during her voyage to the Cape, and thls was used, whilo that in th casks remained untouched; and that In a smilar ship the apparatus for condensing sea water was wholly neglected, It can be fitted at smanl cost to sallingvessels or to screw or paddle steamers, the product of course being in proportion to the fire used, but in aU cases it may be considerable. Sir Edward Parry once told me, on the fitting of the Ajax and Blenheim blockships with screw propellers, that th diminution of the capadity to carry water in those ships, by reason of the space occupied by the engines, would be counterbalanced by the facility of condensing water. Now, referring to the case cited, Imust add that it is one thing to condense water, another to make it drinkable. As in the process of condensing or distillation the water is robbed of its oxygen, it becomes necessary to aerate it, and this may be effected by the very simple proce3s of passing it two or three times through a cask pierced with sm&aL holes or a coarse seive, care being taken that while it Is running it is exposed to the free action of the air. The importance of additional water on a long voyage across the line to our soldiers is very great. Is mere negligence to deprive them of it; or is the commanding officer of the troops to be blameless if he omit to instruct his men how to prepare the water when it ha been served out to them? I am here reminded of the gross neglect of cookery by soldiers which I have seen on board trausports. Soldiers know nothing about preparing salt beef or pork In a esip' galley. They have a separate kitchen, and ore not in' structed by the sailors. I once saw 300 men endeavouring to eat the hardest possible salt meat and dumplings on board the-, in the Black Sea. The soldier's friend was on board and asked ML Soyer to suggest a remedy, and the next day both were excellent; the difference aose from the senior sergeant having had the beef in the boiler one hour the first day and eight the eecond. There were half a dozen officers on board, but it was not etiquette for them to Interfere with their men's dinner. The salt meat for the army is contracted for (as for the navy) to remain ser. viceable for three years, and before it can be made into nutritious and wholsome meat for cooking it has to be washed, soaked, or parboiled (and if it goes through all these processes the better). 'Unless the superfluous salt is thus got rid of our soldiers cannot arrive in health in India, even though they have the advantage on ship-board of thaSt lemon-juice which was denied them in the Crimea, becawe it had gone into the stores of the Medical Department in. stead of those of the Commissariat. One simple method of getting rid of the salt is to place the beef lightly In an empty cask, the bottom of which has been bored full of small holes, and then to allow sea water continuosly baled or pumped into it for 'some hours to percolate through the cask. When this is done by sailora the cask is lashed in the chains or rigging, so as to keep the the decks olean. IL Soyer, in his admirable book just published by Rout. ledge, called Saye's Culinary Campaign, has given reoeipt of the greatest value for cooking salt meat, which no troop. ship should sail without. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. IL B. Sept. 21.
ANOTHER JAOK STEELE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-There are more "Jaok Steeles" in the British army than perhaps the country wots of. You have quoted the instance of two in the Infantry; I hope yoa will not refuse to chronicle one of the Artillery. It is that of the present Quartermaster of the 2d battalion of that corps. I need not designate him by name, lest, like all such men, he should not be pleased at It. He was the sergeant-major of G field battery attached to the Second Division, and landed with It In the Crimea. He was zealous and intelligent, and an example to every one in the performance of his duty. At the Battle of Inkermann a portlion of the battery to which he was attached, for a moment deserted by the in. fantry, fell into the hands of the enemy. The ArtUlery "Jack Steele," the Quattermaster I speak of, aided by a gunner, with that courage so often characteristic of the British soldier, and which seems to set all odds of numbers at defiance, stood his ground. He got his back to a wheel and defended himsdlf as well as he could with his short sword. He was bayonetted in no less than12 places The gunner, whose name (it may cause a glow of pride in some cottage or home in Englznd to mention It) was James Taylor, was kIlled-at least he died of his wounds next day. The Ruswins for some unrocount. able reason did not fire, but they used their bayonets freely on the two Englishmen both -while they resisted and when, from the effects of their wounds, they felL They were soon driven back, I believe, by a portion of the 88th Regiment, and the guns recovered. The sergeant-major was taken Into camp and his wounds attended to. One in the breast, from his dificulty of breathing, was supposed to have penetrated the lung. He was sent to Soutari, and, recovering sufficiently, he, at his-own request, rejoined his battery in Ahe Crimea, and he was, though a good deal debilitated, the same active, attentlve unun-,viuul oned oMoer ho had always been. He continued in this position until, for his merits and his services, he was promoted to a commission in the land Transport Corps. He remained in the Crimea with this part of the service until the war was over. He won the respect and esteem of all under whom he served In the Artillery, and I believe he did the same in the arduous duties he had to perform in the newly-raised Land Trans. port Corps. When peace came the latter was reorgaalzed (we are always reorganizing everything now-a-days) and became the Military Train. The Artillery sergeant-major, who had risen to the rank of captain, was offered, with the liberality and good faith which distinguished the end of the war, an inferior position under the new rruangement or a half-pay of 6a. a-day. He very properly accepted the latter, nd an excellent soldier in the prime of life was worse than lost to the service. It is almost equally the same in his present position. He is, as a quartermaster of a battalion, con. demned to be statdoned all his life at Woolwich, andnever to rise higher. He is decorated with a well-earned Victorih Cross, but his military career is at an end. If he has any ambitious aspirations, any desire to do more than he has done-and his decoration at the hands of his Queen, withl the notice he has met with for his valour, makes It likely that it is so-he must be content to merge them in that sickly desigfiton, more sickly now than ever to such men as he in the present circumstances of England, a " Wool. wich soldier." It is a hard case that some hope of a worthier and better fate is not beforo him. Is It, may I ask, impossible to open it ? He has qualities besides the highest courage, or no one would seek it for him. If you notice his case, perhaps Eomething may be done. These men never grumble, never attend levees, never disturb official ease in any way. The desire to do their duty is their first and only consideration. They will, I thinkr, be grateful to the liberality of The lTimes to permit to be said for them what their modSesty will never allovv them to say for themselves. If they can be benefited, and ours must be a bad sysem indeedl if they cannot, the service will receive an impulse which will circulate a healthy tone to its very exctremaijes, If we have no room for such men, lt u crowd 1 and t to make it.

AN ADVNTB IN M ALS .-Genoa, S6pt. 14.- "Andnow I must tell you how it was quite on the cards that you might never have seen me again, except in the Convent Morgue which would hAve been a dull thing. I got to Orsleres about 3; and as I could not stop in that miserable place, although I knew It was late, I got a mule, vwith a mam, to start at once for the convent. The weather was coming on queer, but nothing out of the way, so I went on, leaving Favret to foUow with my luggage on his mule, amd the man You inow I ao well up in the locaty. At St. Pierre the rain began, and a was so cold with riding that I pulled up at the canteen (the last habitation up the pan) and got somebrandy; and while Iwasthere themancameno, leaving Favret behind to get some dinner and rest his mule, which had come with us all the way from the TUte Noire ihat day. The man, the mule, and l left the cantcen about balIf-past 6, and dark and dreary enough the route looked. About half-pat 7 we arrived at the first deadhouse-not the Morgue, but the refuge-and then a storm came on such as I had never before witnesed. It now got pitch dark, hut the lightning was so incessant that we traced the way between us pretty well until in another half hour, above the Pont d'Hudri, a dense fog came on, with a cutting sleet, and the rain came down as if in one rheet. The mule got frightened and turned round, but we got 'her head to wind' again, until in mnother quarter of anl hour we got on a sheet of snow, and neither the man nor I could me out the track, and the water was raging and lashing and roaring apparently on every side of us, but we could wee nothing except in the refraction of the light from the snow. The mnan was a famous fellow. He said, ' We cm't stop here, and we can't go on, but, if you will mind the mule, I will try and get to the convent.' This was a dreary alternative, but I stuok my biton in the snow tied the mule to it, and then got in her shelter, as he cruncAed over a few feet of snow on his way, and then I heardhim no more. I did not mind for the first ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, but I soon got fearfully cold, and Idid not dare move, not knowing what was on either aide of me; and when half an hour had passed and I was stillihere I certainly thought it was a bad business. I shouted as loud as I could, but my voice was nothin in the winad and you can understand, in a situation like that what horrible things came into my mind; and I thought it would be so hard for me to be lot there who knew every stone almost on the pass. I had been wet through one hour before, but that was nothing; but there wa a sack of corn on the mule, and I was just going to cut this down and open it to put over me when I thought I heard the dogs. I listened In agony for five minutes, but the wind came roaring on again, and I was all but done ea I saw a light dancing up above and before me. This came on, and I gave a shout, which was answered, and in a few minutes more the man reached me. We now found we were off the track, but we soon got on it again, and the reulsion of feeling was so great that how the rest of the 'ay was accomplished up to the convent I don't know. They were all in great excitement there. Meillen was out and met me at the door. They did not know it was I only that there was a travellerin danger; and when i staggereddripping, and frozen and chattering into the room, who shoul be there but-, of the Garrick, and young - ? But X could not say much to any of them, so Heillen took me into a hot air room and dried me, and found me some fresh things, and after a time some life gotinto me; but I could not eat any supper. I did not make a to do about it, but I was very grateful when I got to bed. I should add that I sent the man and the 'marronler' to look after Venanoe, and they found him an hour afterwards in the ame lock, at the same place. It was cheerful to hear that the snow where we had lost the route, was that of an avalanche of ast year, which came down from Mont Mort and killed two men. I saw them next morning In the Morgue, and winced as I looked at them. The poor fellows were found close together. I also heard afterwards that this storm (Thursday night, September 9, was one of the wildest known for yeas Above Verrex, in the valley of Aosta, the water broke and carried away a village, or raoher hamlet, at the time I was on the mountain, so the diligence couldn't go from Aosea to Turin, and we were the first who crossed on Saturday, with men to carry r uge.

MIDDLESEX SESWjoyS.ON fda, S&pt. 2L The September General Sesdons of the Peace for the County of Middleser commenoedl this morning at ClerkenweU before Mr. CRIAsY and a bench of mrgistrates There were the n:mes of 72 prisoners in the calendar, 60 charged with felony, and 12 withmsdemeanour. Mir. Cnx.asY delivered the charge to the grand jury, And told them that the duty of doing so had devolved upon him in consequenoe of an attaok of illeess from which the Asist. Ant-Judge was suffering. James Taylor, 42, a respectable-looking naan, was indicted for having feloniously embezzled three sums of money which he had receved on account of Jamnes lAver, his master. Mr. Metcalfe appeared for the prosecution, instructed by Mr. Wontuer. A brief for the defence was handed to Mr. Sleigh after the trial had commenced. The prosecutor was an emery paper manufhcturer, ironInon^er, &cw, inrrug on business under the name of ILver (I SI, inaBuxton-street, iffle-end, and the prisoner was his ravlle, hvin in that capacity to collect orders and receive money, his duty being to account for the et Ltter to the proseoutor the first time he saw him after the receipt,generally every dy The payment of the three sums mentioned in the indctment to the prisoner was proved, and the prosecutor stated that he had not accounted to him for them inone nstncethe sum paid to the prisoner was 31. 9s. He accounted in his book for 21 9s., having, it ws alleged, embezzled the difference Finding this to be the case the prosecutor took advice, acting upon which he ave the prisoner into custody, when the latter acknowledge&the irregularities in his accounts, bat claimed the amount of the deficienoy, and even more, as due to him for commission upoa sales he had effected, and said it was merely a matter of account betwee him and Mr. lAver. The prisoner had a salary of 25s. per week and a certain rate of oommsion upon sles on acount Of which he received 15., per week, the baance being struck when the books were made up. The prosecutor stated that the prisoner had not the least authority to detin money he a received on acoount of commission In the course of cross-eminaton .the prosecutor sid thoe prsonek had been in his service ie tecember lst, and snoe the 1st of March he had brought him business to the amount of 902. 12s. 7d., but of thAt about 300. were bad debts, and the prisoner had even sold goods to the acoount of a person who was an insolvent petitioner, and in prison. On the commission being blabnoed it was found that the sum of 31. 12s. was due to the prisoner, but It was subject to deductions for returned goods and bad debts. The prisoner had made incorrect statements of the amounts beh reeiredfromtheustomers. Hehadneveroomplained that money which he hadyaid over had not been entered in the books, if the deductions to which the balance of conminion was liable were made, the prisoner would then have received more than he was entitled to. Mr. SLEIGo in his address to the jury urged that upon such evidence the pr,soner asuely couid not be convicted of feloniously approprLating the money. If he had kept It back under any Idea ofright, or claim of right, however absurd or frivolous such Idea might be, he was not guilt7 of the charge as framed in this indictment. It"s* question of account, and upon the prosecator's own shownog there was a balance due to the prisoner, although it was maid that the amount was subj to deductions The accounts had not been strictl regularperhaps, but there had been no felonious approprlon on the part of the prisoner. Mr. CicAsy summed up, sad The juy, after a short consultation, returned a verdict of Not Guiuy. The prisoner was then indicted for embezzling three other sums--viz., 17s. 9d., 11. Os. Ed., and 11. 9s. 2d., recelved on acocount of hiz master. 3Mr. 4r=oLF,R said, it asn not for him to comment upon a verdict given by a jury - if they had come to the concluSion that the prisoner had not acted feloniously he was of course enttled to an acquittal Bnt in this cae he should submit that the question of commission had nothing wbatever to do with the matter. The defendant, he should prove, receSived specifio sums of money on his master's sooount; it was his dut to pay over and duly account for the sums he so received. But, instead of doing so, he entered in the books less sums than he received, keeping the difference for himself, and making no claimn for commision, for he wa receiving 15s. per week on that account, and had actually been overpadd when the deductions for his bad debts had been made. Evidence was then given of the payment of the sums to the prisoner. A som of 11. Uls. 6d. was entered as 13a 9d. -the others were not accounted for. Mr. SLP.air, in a few words, said this case disclosed precisely the same state of facts as the last, and he thought the jury wonld not stultify themselves by finding the prisoner guilty in one case and acquitting him in another, the evideuce being exactly the same in each. Mr. CRB.ASy having summed up, the jury found the prisoner ZNot Guilty, and he was discharged. Aaron Winter 36 was indicted for 1raudalently obinIng, by means ol falsepretences, 101b; of tobacco, with Intent to defraud. Mr. Payne appeared for the prosecution. The prisoner was not defend It appeared that Mfr. Westbrook-, proprietor of the PoulXerers' Arms Tavern, Freeman's-court, Cheapside, had a standing order at Messrs. dIbert's, tobaccomanufacturers, Wlntechapel, so that when tobacco was sent for on Mr. Westbrooek's account it was understood what qantty and qualities wer required. By some means teo prisoner became aequainted with this, and he went to Messrs. Robert*s and ed for Mr. Westbrook's order, and a parcel of blb. of tobacco was delivered to him in the usual way. He -went a second time and obtained a second parcel. The fraud was subsequently die.overed, and information given to the police, and the prisoner wa3 apprehended by a city constable. He denied at first that he was the person but at tho station he said he had heard that Mr. Westbrook's waiters were suspected, so in justice to them he would acknowledgethat he wasthe manwhofetchedthe tobacco, and said further that none of the waiters knew anything about it, The ptincipal barmaid at the Poulterers' Arms proved that the prisoner had no authority to go to Messs. Roberts for tobacco in Mr. Wtsbrook's name. She was the only person who had authority co send for it, and she certainly never sent the prisoner. The prisoner said Mr. Westbrook himself sent him for the tobacco during the barmaid's absence in the country, and, although the latter denjed that she had been in the country he persisted that she was away to his knowledge for a fortnight. Before he made this statement he elicited that Mr. WYestbrook ws not in attendance. The jury found him uilty, and four previous convictions for felony were proved against him. He had been sentenced to transportration, and had reoeived a ticket of *Mr. Csm.&s entenced him to be kept in penal servitude for seven years. James East, 35, pleaded "Guilty" to en indictment charging him with obtatning byfalse pretences, from Henry InsOn, 27 trusses of hay, of the valuo of 31. 5s., with intent to defrauad. The police stated that there were several cases against the prisoner of defrauding farmers of hay and keeping the procseds. He came from Uxbridge. Sentenced to six months' hard labour. John Mac}, 17, was indicted for stealing a coat, the property of John Shields Thompson, his master, and Frances ±'rcnderville, 30, was indicted for feloniously receiving the samle. Mr. F. H. Lewis prosecuted. The prisoner Mack was errand-lad in the service of the prosecutor, a tailor in Holborn, who having reason to suspect that he was being robbed employed Tyler, an officer of the G divion, to watch. He saw Mack beckon PrendervlUe to the shop-door, and hand her a coat with which she went away, but he stopped her and took her into custody. She denied having the coat, but it was found in her apron. The prosecutor had lost a good deal of property, no doubt in the same way. The prisoners were found Gu;it. Mlck wa sentenced to six and P'renderville to 12 months' hard labour. John Thomas, 22, dock labourer, and James Doyle, 22, sere indicted for stealing a watch, the nroperty of John Tobus, from his prson, They pleaded; Guilty." Doyle was an old offender, having been sentenced to a yes hard labour on two occasons. Thomas wps not knowen. The COURT sentenced Doyle to four years' penal servitude, and Thomas to six months' hard labour.

CALIFORNIA, (FROM OUR OWN COMMONDENT.) SAN FRGACIsco; AG. 4. - Politics are at pretent the all-engroeibg l)'ecw or interest with the majority of the people, jr viet ef the general elections to come off ill eptember. I It is gratifying to have to state tb .'6 the different io litical conventions convened for arranging the e?eetion campaign approve the payment of the State debt, resolutions to this effect having been passed by all of them, I am bound to umy, however, that there is a strong under-current of private feeling agaiut this just and laudable sentiment. The Treasury of the State has never been in so healthy a condition as a.t present. The public clais atre inow paid in cash, wd the whole financial business is conducted on a sh basis. The Stamp Act produces a vonsiderable amount of revenue, ond, what is a new feabare, it is accounted for. Formerly large portions of the State revenue never reached the Treasury, aad much of what did was -stolen In San Francisco, the " Reform" party, 'which is tomposed vf persons friendly to the late Vigilance Committee, has nowdinated a "ticket" of men suipposed to be the best qualilied for municipal offlicee on the ground of honesty and economy, without regard to politictl creed, which is likely to b 'uc-- cessfid. This is " a consummation devortly to be wvished," for never wras an unfortxnate city Bo muismansaged. 'er once splendid property has been frittered awey by rogues and fools. She is withouat *money and in bad credit, and deeply in debt, al'though the taxes are enormous. Nothing that you 1now of in England ecuals the amount of taxes in this country; nor would t1he English people endure the arbitrary legal madhineryby which taxes are imposed ard levied in Califomnia. So much for freedom and independenoe:! In the last fortnight several fres have taken place in various parts of the State. For instance, Mlichigan Bluffs, in Placer county, was totally annihilated; loss,'$162,000. St. Louis, a mining *town in Sierra .county, was obliterated by the devastating element; not a house left standing; loss, '$200,000. In Shasta a fire destroyed buildings 'valued at $10,-400. In Grass Valley a similar ca'lasnity caused a IOES of $25)00, and at Mokelumnehill, of $5,000; and at Sacramento of a like sum *vf $5,000, besides a nusnberof other smaller fres. -Sach are somne of the short bnt significant para*graphs culed from the interior papers. A joint-stock cormpany, composed of 50 Germans, has just been formed for imnprov g the culture of the vine in the southern portion of California.; 1,000 acres of suitable land has been purchased by the -company at Los Angelos, which iB divided into 50 farmns of 20 acres each, and which are to be brought into oultivation with all possible speed. This undertaking promises well. Such is the fertility of the soil and the adaptability of the climate of Los Angelos that an acre of vineyard yields 1,500 gallons of wine. A lead or vein of alum earth was discovered the other day iu Calaveras county. It is said to contain S0 per cent. of pure alum, and is considered valuable. A still more important fact has lately been demonstrated-namely, the adaptability of the soil and climate of California to the growth of the cotton plant. Several samples raised at a place called 'Grizzly Flat, in Placer county, are readv for exhibition at an industrial fair to be held next month at Stockton. For the last few years great attention has been paid to the breeding of sheep in California. The sheep of the old stock was a small coarse coated breed, of little value for flesh or wool. Of late several importations of Leicesters, Southdowns, and Merios have arrived from Australia and Puget Sound, as well to cross with the native ikeep as to breed a pure stock from. Both attempts have been so far successful. The mutton has improved greatly in size and flavour, and the quality of the wool of the crosased breeds has so improved as to induce well-grounded hopes that this wil soon become a wool-exporting country to a large extent. The increase is, 1 believe, unequalled. Three lambs at a birth are common, and two usuaL The dropping of only one is an exceptIon. There was a sale at auction a few days ago of 50 merinos brought from Australia, the result of which will, Y doubt not, interest many of your readers. Here It is,- " The first lot put up, consisting of 20 cwes and one ram, was knocked down at $31 per hcad. After this 10 lots of the same numnber were put up and brought $24 60O. to $20 5Oc. per head. Six ewes, singly, brought $28 to $,21 per head, and two rams $75 and $85 each. The result hardly seemed to meet the expectations that were indulged prior to the sale." Prior lots from Australia brought higher prices. These prices are not very remunerative to the shipper. Business.-During the fortnight we have had 20 arrivals of merchant ships, all heavily laden with merchandise, except one whaler in from a cruise. These arrivals have increased stocks considerably; but the demand has improved somewhat, and there has been more activity in the market of late. Tea continues to advance ; but the most notable advance has been in the price of opium, and from rather a singular cause. The consumption is confined to the Chinese, who use the opium for smoking. Hitherto it was admitted without scruple, but the other day one of the Custom-house inspectors announced that he had discovered that by law opium could only be introduced as a drug, which must contain a certain percentage of morphine (0 per cent., I believe), and that as the opium prepared for smoking had but 2 per cent of morphine, it was inadmissible. Prior to the promulgation of this discovery all the opium in the market had been bought up by three persons, of whom the 'cute inspector is said to be one, and, in consequence, it has run up from $5 and $8 to $16 the tael. There is a large quantity on board ship which cannot be landed, but which must be exported or in a given time destroyed, and if the inspector's interpretation of the law be sustained the price will go up prodigiously, for the Chinese cannot go without it. The consumption is about 30,000 taels a month in California. The crops are harvested, the grain is of good quality and in good condilion, and the yield is more abundant than was anticipated. The produce market is unprecedentedly active at high rates. This great activity in grain is caused by the exhaustion of the old stocks, which have been cleared away for exportation. Although there is a demand for exportation, the interior traders take all the grain tbat comes in at advancing rates. In short, the market for domestic produce was never in so healthy a state. From all parts of the mining regions the accounts are favourable, and as much gold is being taken out as ever before. Dturing tbe first week of the last fortnight the receipts of dust in San Francisco were small, but last week there was a great flow, sufficient to supply the demand for bars. These are at 880 par. From Mexico $400,000 in silver arrived by last mail steamer, most of which is to be trarshipped to China. About $45,000 of the lot which was sold here brought 15 per cent. premium. Money abundant, and Interest falling.

From Washington Territory we learn that Her Majesty's steamer Satellite, 21 guns, and the United States' steamer Active. had arrived in Steilacoom Harbour on the 4th 'of July, both vessels under orders from their respective Governments for the service of adjusting the North-Western boundary dispute. A curious case occurred in the mines the other day illustrative of the existence of slavery in China, which is thus reported:- "ABDnUcION CAsEX-Drytownwasbesieged for two days by Chinamen, witnesses and friends in a case of abduction. The Ledger says:-' The abducted party had been brought to this country by a woman as a slave for any pur. pose, and borrowed $400 of the defendant to purchase her freedom, giving him a w,rritteu mortgage of herself to secure the payment of the money. Thepapers vwere duly produced, and the interpreter stated that they were good and lawful in China. The defendant had only endeavoured to enforce his lien.'"' The American Consul at Mazatlan had been imprisoned a short time ago by one of the judges in consequence of a dispute about a vessel, but the prompt action of the other consuls procured his speedy release. This unlucky occurrence, added to charges of murder of American citizens brought against the authorities of Sonora at the time of the riots of the Filibusters under Crabb, is likely to end in another brush between the two countries, which will " eventuate " in further acquisitions of territory in furtherance of the creed of "manifest destiny." The export of gold from San Francisco in July to all parts was $4,110,263 12c. The exports of the six months prior to July were $23,638,990 49c., making the total exported in the present year $27,749,253 61c., as manifested. To this amount I think $1,000,000 may be added as having been taken by private hands and by merchant ships without bemng manifested, to arive at the gross amount which left the countly. I The value of merchandise exported last month was $257,066, which shows a falling off from the corresponding month of last year of about $154,000. This decrease will probably be made up this month, as there are orders for the shipment of grain to Australia not yet executed. It wiUl help to show the course of trade to state the countries to which these exports went. The gold went to New York (by far the greater portion), England, Australia, Panama, China, Chili, and Batavia. The merchandise was sbiptd to Mexico, China, Chili, Australia, the Sandwich Islands, Peru, andVancouver's Asland The 1 alue of merchandise entered in July for duty at the Custom-house was $587,817; ditto, for warehousing, $217,207. Withdrawn for consumption, $380,161; ditto, for export, $38,430. Duties reeeived, $200,106.

SIR WILLIAM HENRY DiijoN, KT,, K.O.H., VIcEADMIAL OF TIM RED.-Thisdistingtusbed officer was the son of Sir John Talbot Dillon, a baron of the Holy Roman empire, and author of Trscvels in Spain and other works. Paternally he was descende i from Logon Delome, or the Valiant, third son of ONeill, Monarch of Ireland, and through female descent from the house of Wingfield, being great grandson of Sir Mervyn Wingfield, and the senior clirnant to the barony of Scales. Sir W. H. Dillon entered the navy at a very early period of life, and comrnenced his career on board the Alcide, 74, commanded by Sir Andrew Snape Douglas. He was midshipman on board the Thetis, and in 1793 served with Captain Gambier in the Defenco, 74, where he was stunned by a splinter in Lord Howe's celebrated action on June 1, 1794. He accompanied Captain Gambier in the Prince George, 9g, and as senior midshipman was in Lord Brid port's action with the French fleet off Ile de Groix, June 23, 1795. He then served in the Glory, 9S, and in the Thnnderer, 74, under Rear-Admiral Sir ugh Christian, and was at the reduction of St. Lucio in May, 1796, c-arrying a flag of truce to take possession of Pigeon Island. Be became acting lieutenant of the Arsadne, 20 guns, Captain R. L. Ball, whence he was remnoved to the Amiable, 32, Captains Mainwaring and Lobb, and was frequently engaged with the enemy's batteries. In 1798 he was in the Glenmore, 36, Captain Duff, and co-operated with the army at Wexford durSn the Irish Rebe)lion, where he succeeded In arresting the lrith rebel chief, Skallion. He afterwards served en the Jamaica station, assisted in the capture of the corvette El Gal o, In sight of a Spanish line-of battle ship and frigate, and aTo in the taking of La Diligente, a French national brig, the Lanzanotta, a Spanish armed packet, and several privateers, of which he had the cbar8e. In 1801he was pre-sent at the deStruction of the British frigate Maleager, which had grounded in the Gulf of Mexico,and he effected an exchange of a part of the crew who had been takeon prisoners. As senior lieutenant of the Africaine, with a flag of truce from Lord Keith to the Dutch oommodore, Valterbach, at Heiveotsluys, he was in 1803 made most unjustifiably a prisoner, handed over to the French, and detained In captivity until Septemaber, 1807. The following year (having been made commandor in 1805) he assumed charge on the Leith station of an old worn-out sloop, the Childers, carrying only 14 121b. carronades and G5 men, in which, on the coast of Norway, he gallantly engaged and ultimately drove off, after an action with intervals of upwards of seven hours duration, a Danish man-of-war brig of 60 guns and 200 men, ln this service he was severely wounded, and bin meritorious conduct was aCeknowledged by, tho Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's by th- )resent of a sword valued at 100 guineas.

IRELAND. (nomora OwN I VUBWINI, MONDAY MoRIUG. TIM DISARMA BENT AT BZ1LFLST. It appears from the Belfast, Mercury of Saturday that the first day (Friday) on which the proclamr tion took effect very little of the armament of Sanday-row or Pound-street belligerents rerine in town when the morning's sun rose. lained, " Country cousins wore in great request OD ' a good many time-honoured old pieces,1 -a v fneeday, and new Brunnagems, were carried over the X somdear banded for safe keening Snto the the boundray, scribed dwellers in thie rural hellds of 'sthenpromaxim has been adopted Sn ', few inces, and the obnoxious weapons have u,Q nicely wapped up in oiled flannel as a cerement, and 'nried in a grave, there to await the time when the r e.oval of the han just impoeed will give an opportuity 'or their exhumatiou. In the meantime the people ot Ballymarre;tt are exerting themselves to escape Wrcgn the consequences of the proclamation. They intend to forward a memorial to the Lord-Lieutenant, by a deputatton, praying exemption from the proclamation and fromi the expenses attending the suppression of the riots, In which they didnot participate." Of the military preparations to preserve the peace another local journal (the WMig) thus reports - " More troops (of the 30th Regiment) poured in yesterday evening. Belfast is rapidly becoming a camDp The reinforcement of the constabulary is also considerabie. In short, the steed being clearly away the arrangements to look the door are of the most unexceptionable character. Had all this vigour been displayed a fortnight ago there would have been no necessity for the degradation to which the proclamation has subjected Belfast However, the consolidated fund is to pay, no doubt, and why should wre object to these supererogatory but amusing precautions? Perhaps, it is a pity such a mass of fine soldiery and constabulary should he lost to India, but when Delhi is taken and Beugal is paCified it Is very likely they will all be hurried Under the head of "Blunder in the Proclamation," the Whig has the following statement * " Government was under the impression that it had ' proclaimed' Belfast. This turns out to be a complete mistake. The proclamation mentions Shankhill and Ballymacarrett. The lord-Lieutenant declares that ' the Peace Preservation Act shall apply to, and be in force in and for the pariah of ShankhiU, in the barony of UJpper Belfast and county of Antrim, and the towniand of Ballymacarrett, in the barony of Lower Castlereagh, in the county of Down.' That is all; within those distriets arms must be given up, ae. But the borough of Belfast, in Its extended boundary includes, another townland in Down-viz., Ballynafeigh. Thus, persons indisposed to give up arms have only to place their guns or other murderous weapons with friends in Ballynafeigh, to be safe from all penalties, and et to hold the means of riot at their disposaL WeA is Jsaltynafeigh to become a magazine, or w'the Lord-Lieutenant amend his proclamation? It is easy to understand how the blunder arose. The Lord-Lieutenant's lawyers looked to the old boundary, and forgot the new arrangements of 1853. Such an incident indicates the way business is done in that masterly institution." The subjoined latest account from Belfast appears in Sausnders of this morning:- "Belfast, Sunday Eveuing.-Proclamations are not ot such immediate effect in queLing populir tumults as they are minacious in the context. The state of the town at presentis as disturbed in appearance asonlast Sunday,before the idea of the Lord-Lieutenant's proclamation was even entertained. Lsst night the firing of shots was continuous, and in the vicinity of Antrim-road there was heard, about 12 o'clock, regular platoon firing, which, as some of the constabulary disebarge thelrmuskets, musthave beenfromparties of the Pound Loaning guerillas pract!sing by moonlight. To-day the quays are paraded by 400 constabulary under arms, commanded by County-Inspector Williams. Up to the time I write (3 o'clock) there has been no disturbance, and no person has risen to preach to the crowds that are paing along the quays, as usual, every Sunday. Along with County-Inspector Williams the following subinspectors, with parties of their men, are with the force on the quays :-Sub-Inspector Bindon, Belfast; Armstrong, Newry; Newland, from the dep6t, Phcenix Park, with 50 men; Despard, Newtownards; Cuorry, Meath, with 50 men. The vicinity of Albert-crescent, which was so often made a battle-ground of party during the recent riots, wore to- dav a very formidable aspect. From 60 to 100 constables, with loaded mnuskets in their hands, are placed on the Sandy-row side of the boundary, where the shade is most inviting. Subinspectors ReUy, Darcy, and Fulton are in command. We had also a large accesson to the troops in garrison on Friday evening - Colonel Mauleverer and 400 men of the gallant 30th arrived Lete that evening. I cannot say that there is no reason to apprehend a breach of the peace; the people's passions are aroused on both sides, and should they come into collision, irritated as they are by the revelationsin many cases unexpected-which the Government commission has brought forth, unquestionably blood will be spilt. To-morrow x. Tracy, 11L, holds a court in the County Court-house for granting licenses to carry arms, and I understand that he will be very chary in giving licenses to persons who in other periods would be allowed to have firearms without even a shadow of suspicion. The fear is that respectable people who are of timid dispositions -maybe frihtened into lending their arsm to those who wiUl -make abad use of them. Disturbances are apprehended in Lurgan, and Eioad-constable I'Carvon and 12 men are now leaving Belfast for that town, {norder to preserve the peace should an occasion for their interference arise." THE IRS SEPOYS. The Clonmd C(hroni&c says that the town of Carrick-on-Suir has again been selected as a site for a further manifestation of individual disaffection. On Sunday morning a placard, attractivelydisplayed, and written in a bold legible hand, was posted on the chapel gates, setting before the Militia of Ireland "the glorious example of the Sepoys." "We call upon you," say those cowardly incendiaries, "to know whether you will become food for powder in India, or rather whether you will not imitate the example of the Sepoys, and burst asunderthe chains of slaveryin which you have been so long bound? Now is the time to avenge all your wrongs on the head of the accursed Saxon. Follow, then, the glorious example of the Sepoys, and unfurl the green flag on your national hills." If the concoctors of these atrocious documents could be laid hands upon, and a sound whipping at a cart's tail administered by the "proper authority," the operation would, no doubt, have its due effect upon the enthusiasts who are at present writing up the Sepoy cause in two or three Irish journals. Apropos of the Irish Yilitia the Waterford = ail (a Conservative journal) says :- "The Waterford ArtiUery assemble at the barracks hero on the 1st of October, and we are told that its being caUed out was entirely in compliment to the citizens The Tipperary, which mustered much stronger, was on the list, and its claims were set aside to make way for ours, as his Rxcellency the Lord-Lieutenant wished to show his sense of the manner in which he was recelved while in this city at the agricultural show. We were rather surprised at hearing that several Roman Catholic clergymen of the county Tipperary felt hurt at the Tipperary boys not being caUed out. They say that both the regiments of the county Down were emboded, and neither of those of the county Tipperary. Why should the Down Protestants gtf a preference over the Tipperary Catholics 7 This feeling is quite at variance with the Sepoy articles of the Z~iionu and with the strange placards at Carr-ck, and shows that lrishmen, whether lag or clerical, would wish to be treated as if they hadi the confidence of their Qaeen."
STATE: BEDSTEADS FOR THE B&Yptux GovBmwMENT.-A magnificent electro-silver state bedstead, manu. factured by Messrs. Charles Williams and Co. (late Catch. pole and wiluiams), of 223, Oxford-street, is now ona view at Willls's Rooms, King-street, St. James's. The bedstead is one of six which were ordered by the late Viceroy Abbas Pasha, in contemplation of the marriage of his son to the daughter of the late SultaofEgyt. Three of the bedsteads are stationay n h te the inoveable, or, as they are caled, camp bedsteads, which admit of being taken to pieces and deposated in a case of ver small dimensions. The design has no pretensions to oginalit, r. W iams admitting with very creditable candour that he derived the idea from the celebrated carved woeden bedstead by a Belgian artisan, which was so much admired in the Exhi- ition of 1,i51. The dimensions of the bedstead are as follows:-The height 13ft., the length ft. 6in., and the width Sft. i the smaUnessin the latterrespect wasexplainedbyMr. Wiliams saying that in the East it is not customary to sleep two in a bed. The head of the bedstead is composed of eNegant polished pierced work out of the solid metal and is surmounted by a rioh Italian foliage. The foot banti. fuUy harmonizes in character with the bead, and is enriched on the outer side by a large arabesque shell in bold relief, The sides are composed of rich Italian scroll-work, the open work being shown uphy crimson velvet lining. The base consists of highly'-polished Guiloche ornament, and the entire work is surmounted by an elegant arched canopy, supported by four light, briUiantly polished pllars. The whole presents a very beautiful piece of fairy- e workmanship, and reflects great credit on the ingenuity and taste of the artist. The traveling bedsteads vary int some respects in their design, but these are not yet completed. we understand that the price of the whole of the articles will not be less than 10,0001. Hugh Thurban, an agent of the Egyptian Government, has, with his family, ispected the workc, and has expressed himself much grati. fied at the excellent manner in which it has been executed. Messrs. Williams and Co. have long been honoured by the orders of the Egyptian Government, and some sew years ago executed for the late Pasha four magnificent silver electro-pated candelabra 18 feet in height, with 24 lights each. was observablo that throughout the whole of the design for this splendid piece of art there was not a single allegorical figure or heraldic device introduced. This reminds us that many years ago, when a splendid service of porcelain was specially manufactured for the then Viceroy of Egypt, the artist having embellished his work by various mythelugical subjects, the whole service was rejected and returned upon the hands of the maker. Mr. Williams, on this matter being pointed out to him, said he had been -aformed by high authority that aUlsuch embellishments were contrary to the " custom" of the Evyptians.

DAniel Wilson, the vicar, took the chair. Amon thoe present were the Rev. J. Harableton, the Rev. H. Venn, the Rev. 3Mr. Child, Mr. Layton, the church. wardens, Mr. Thomas Vousley, and a number of other clergymen and gentlemen of etanding in the parish. The CHaAntAS aid they were met under very sad and affecting circumstances, and he believed it was wished to gtve as much as possible a devotional tone to the proceedings. The meeting would therefore ba opened and closed by prayer on behalf of the snfferers, in sympathy with whom they were assembled. It was unneoesary for him to duate at any length upon the fearful occurrences which had taken plce in connexion with the mutinies, as every one must be well acquainted with them. He, however, read the foUowing extract from A letter from the Bishop of Calcatta, dated the 10th of August:- At 6 p.m, on Batrdey, who asould arrive but Lird Elgin, hastenng baok from Obina. and bringing with him 1,500 t oops.

He also read extracts from various other letters, giving a fearful picture of the sufferings of our countrypeo le in India. He thought these would be sufficient to touc= the feelings of his hearers. He had sdncere pleasure in announcing-what, he believed, was not generally known-that Her Majesty had resolved immediately to have a day appointed for publc humiliation and prayer, which would be a source of gratitude to many at the present moment. In concluaion h he exhorted his hearers to co-operate in the objects of the meeting to the utmost of their tower. The Rev. Mr. VrNw moved the folrowing resolutlion - " That this meeting, while humbly aeknowledging the mighty hand ot God stretched out in hetening judgments over Britiah India, dedres to expres Its deep sympathy withthe nwmerous safferers who have been left totaly desttute through the barbarous and Inhuman conduct of the mutineem" General ANxeAcDmt seconded the motion, and it was carred umnsimQously. The Rev. J.

The Rev. W. cAOKEN= eeconded the resolution, which was also unanimously carried. A collection having been made, and most liberallv respoxided to, a prayer was offered up, and the usual vate of thanks to the chairman brought the proceedings to a close. LIVERPOOL. Since the meeting of yesterday week the sum of 5,0001. has been raised towards the relief of the sufferers by the Indian mutiny. SEFII LD. At a meeting of the Sheffield Town-council yesterday Mr. Councillor HARvzY moved that the Mayor be requested to convene a public meeting of the people of Sheffield, for the purpose of inaugurating a subecription in aid of the fund for the relief of our suffering fellow-countrymen in India. He was sure that for such an object every Englishman would give according to his means. Mr. Councillor BROADBnnT seconded the motion. He was sure the people of Sheffield would come forward upon this important occasion and give liberally in aid of the fund, as, to their credit, other towns had done. Sheffield gave a large sum to the Patriotic Fund raised during the Crimean war, and they were now equally anxious to assist in affording support to the unfortunate sufferers in India. Mlr. Councillor S~nr thought sufflcient had already been raised to relieve the pressing w ants of the sufferers, and that Government should comnpensate the sufferers for their losses. Alderman DuNiN said he would not attempt to describe the feeling of the conntry upon the subject of the atrocities perpetrated in India, but there seemed to be an irresistible esire in all parts of the country to meet and talk over those horrors and atrocities. He was sure that feeling was ripe in Sheffield, and regretted that an opporbunity had not sooner been afforded to his townsmen of glving expression to theirfeelings on the subject. Our suffering countrymen inIndia, struggling yaginst fearful odds, and having lost nearly everything they had, would be elevated and enabled to bear up *gairstthe tide that s threatening to overwhelm them when they heard that there was a response in England. A fter some further discussion the motion was agreed to, BRADFORD. In compliance with a numerously signed requisition a public meeting, convened by the Mayor (Mr. H. Brown), was held in the Exchange-room;s Bradford, yesterday, to give practical shape to their sympathies for the sufferers from the mutiny in Indi by COmlmenCing a subscription for The MAYo%, who presided, in opening the proceedings, said the meeting was one of very great importance, and, afterslludingto the sufferings casdto so many of ourfelow countrymen and countrywomenin India by the Sepoy rebel- lion, trusted that the public would show by their subscriptions how deeply they sympathized with the survivors. Bradford, he hoped, would, as in former times, do its duty In trying to soften down the misery of those who had been er feav of dear friends,-in some cases, indeed, of whole Mr . W. WiCn mi, M.P., moved the first resolution. He was not prepared to say that all had been done, either by the Government at home or by the Indian GoTernment, to prevent the rebellion which had burst forth and the shameful atrocities which had been committed, but he fully expected that a searching scrutiny into the cLauses would in due time be made elsewhere. '(Hear.) He would not trouble them with any detail of the manner in which so many men, women, and children had been cruelly massacred, as they were all weU acquainted with that. The object of the meeting was one of sympathy, and sympathy of a practical character. Those who had faUen were now beyond the reach of their aid; but with the survivors, who amidst such sufferings had lost their all, they oould sympathize. The hon. gentleman then proposed the following resolution:- "That this meeting would deeply sYmpaihire with those who, in consequence of the mutiny In the Indian ,rmy. have so unexpeewedly nd calamitously been caUed to endure privatouna end hardships' Oces and wrngs of the most painu characeer. and would express its mouful cmndolecoe with the relatives and friends of all whose lItes have been sarrifdeed in thts fier contest, the records of which, while arkened by the shainaful strocities and rulanly and Irnominionx arbarity on the part of the rebels, wil be rendered illustrious on the Art of our suffering and slaughtered fellow countrymen, by 'he most eroltseats and endurance, andxthe nobles' spirit of p3triotic niartyr The Rev. Dr. BTNE-rT (Vicar) seconded the resolution, Which was unanimously carriod. It was then resolved that a subgcription should be entered into, and a committeo was appointed to carry the proposition into effect. The follong subscriptions were announced :-The fayor, 21.; Mr. H. W. W. Wlckham, 21l- *rAL W. Thompson, 2It. John Rand and Sons. -hlMr S. Laycock, 21U; MIr. W. SE. Forster, 211.; Titus Salt and Sons, 1001.; Mllligan, Forbes, and Co., 1004 S _Y . A meeting of the inhabitants of Selby and the neighbourhood was held on Saturday last in the public room of that town, under the presidency of Lord Londesborough, who, in introducing the business, made some pertinent observations relative to the atrocities which had been perpetrated upon our feUow countrymen and countrywomen in India, stating that if he had been younger nothing would have prevented him from volunteerin- to avenge the cruel mur- ers which had been committed, and as It was he would make every personal pecuniary sacrifice to assist in relieving the wants and necessities of those who are sufferIngIn India. Resolutions were then unanimouslypassed, and it seemed to be the desire of the meeting that nothing should be left undone by the Government in order to place our rule in India for the fature on the most substantial ootlng, and to punish those who had been guilty of the atrocities which had been made knowin to the public. Liberal subscriptions were announced from Lord and Lady Londesborengh, the Hon. Mfr. D8enson, MLP., and other gentlemen. A vote of thanks was passed to Lord Londesborough amid loud cheers. TORQUAY. In addition to the 1404 forwarded to the Lord Mayor from this town, as announeed in e Tirne.q. A further srn of 1001. has been sent to Londont. DEVONSHIRE.

Lord Potmr, ord Courtenay, Sir J. T. B. Duckwvorth, Mr. J, W.

SUBSCRn'POrN FROM MADRAS SzPOYs.-A letter from Coimbatore mentions the remarkable fact of a detachment of the 21st Regiment of Madras Native Infantry havng subscribed towards the fund for the relief of the safferer3 from the mutinies of the Sepoys of the Bengal army. The following communication was sent by Aieutenant Farrer, commanding a detachment of that regiment, dated Coimbatore,July29, to Messrs. ArbuthnotaudCo.,Madras.- Ihavethe honour of forwarding herewith 56r. 3a., being the amout subscribed by the detachment of the 21st Regiment Madras Native Infantry, now stationed at Coimbatore, in aid of the funds at present being raised towards the assistance of loyal subjects of the Crown and Company, or their families and orphans, &c., who have been or are sufferems owing to the recent events in the North-west pro. vYnces. This sum remitted is a voluntary subscription, and every fraction of the same a spontaneous offering, produced upon learning a few days ago that funds were being raised for that object. Those who have come forward to contribute their mites have been actuated therein by two motives-the one of-sympathy for the distressed, the other of horror at eaiTocious acts of those traitorous and treasonable monsters who have so fouly disgraced the name of Sepoy in the Bengal army. I am not, with the exception of one instance, even aware of the amount of individual sum subscribed by the detachment under my command." It appears that the military datachment at Coimbatore con- sists of but one European officer, two native officers, twoI drummers, one fifer, 15 non-commissioned officers, and 100 Sepoys. The pay of the Sepoy there is from sventonine rupees per month, aceordin& to his number of years of selvice.

His words were with difficulty audible, and a tame rendering of one of the moet stormy of characters might not unreasonablyhave been anticipated. Still the careful correctness of his reading and the ease of his manner showed that he had ta'cen no vulgar view of the gigantic usurer; and when it is recollected how much Sir Giles has to do in the fifth act, he will always be pardoned for reserving his moral and physical energies as much as possible in the first two. In the interview with Lord Lovell, when he offers to reward at any ex- ense of purse or conscience the bounty that would ennoble is da ughter and make her "right honourable," he began to showa degree of force which, contrated with his beginnings was not a lIttlo remarkable, while he judiciously blendeu a tuft-hunting respect for the "lord" with the evident surgings of gratified amabition. Tho applause that followed this scene was spontaneous. and genuine. Here was evidently au actor who had thought over the peculiarities he had to portray, and who had resolved to execute his oonceptions to the best of his ability. the great pusionate act with which the piece concludese and which by the dint of accumulated mishaps elevates a bad man into a hero who can command the symoathof his spectators, was most conscientiously =en ered That physical force that can carry along an audience like the action of a whirlwind was certainly not to be found in Mr. Roberts; but, while his foaming mouth bore witness to his own sense of rage, his management of the situation throughout showed that he ws perfectly alive to all the points of passion. So obviously was he master of the business of the scene that perhaps his head wasalittle too oonspicuous above the torrent of his heart, but this very poculiarity checked the perpetration of much unmeaning rant. Oa the other hand, Mr. RLoberts certainly made the most of the groans that follow the collapse of the defeated sinner, and showed that if his last exit Is to be deemed a death, he diea very hard indeed At the fall of the curtain he had the honour of a separate call, and we may say that the guerdon was fairly mernted. The reapnpearace of Mr. Belton last night gave an additional mterest to the performance. Actors of goodlooking spirited young men are by no means over abundant at the present day, and Mr. Belton, who a few yearr ago dia. tinguished himself in that line on the boards of tho prin. cipa London theatres, and has since played with considerable sucoess in the UJnited States, is a welcome apparition. He acted the character of Welborn writh a great deal of spirit and Intelligence, looking gallant in spite of his rags, as if to demonstrate that the fineness of the bird does not alwrays dependo the finees fte feathers.
LYCEUM THEATRE. Miss Louisa Pyne and Mr. W. Harrison have set on foot a new enterprise, the aim of which is to establish English opera on a permanent basis at the Lyceum Theatre. Since these well-known singers left England for the United States more than one attempt has been made professing a similau object-but without success. The reason was obvious. The idea of completeness was altogether overlooked, and in the absence of completeness no such undertaking can possibly answer in the present day. Mis Pyne and her assocate appear to have taken this into aocount, if we may judge from the first performance lst night, when Aaber's delightful opera, Lcs Diamans de la Couronne was given, according to the English version, in such a manner as to merit almost unqualified approval. An orchestra wanting only one or two more violoncellos and basses to be perfect, and a chorus of equal efficiency under the direction of Mr. Alfred Mellon, whose repuatiion as a conductor stands so high as to have gained him the title of "the English Costa," were provided for the occasion, and afforded assurane at the outset that excellence was not to be confined to the principal singers. The rest was to match, since, though with two exceptions, the representatives of the dramatspersowe had no claim to be ranked as "famoug," they were aU competent, andso well up in the words, music, and business of the scene that the result was in aU respects satisfactory. There was not a hltch from beglnning to end, and the beautiful melodies of the king of French composers were eard to the best advantsge. A mere genuine sucoess was never obtainso, one more independently earned and amply Miss Louisa Pyne quitted this country a singer of high promise, and has returned with that promise more than ed. Nothing, indeed, neater and more finished in its way can well be imagined. Her Catarina, as a histrionic grtrayal, is not to be compared to the Catarina of the abels, Duprez, and Chartons of the Parisian stage; but it is no little to say of an English singer that her execution of Auber's music-especially in the brilliant passagesIsurpassesfor grace, ease, and fluency that of any one of those justly celebrated artists. In rendering this tribute to Miss Pyne we give her what is her due, and nothing in exess Her voice is fresh and unimpaired (which shows that her method has been legitimate, and her vocalization no less surprising for its facility than for the command of style which it invariably exhibits, and which enables her to finish the most elaborate cadences and round off the largest phrases in a way that entirely satisfies the most critical ear. Without entering into further detai, we may single out the duet with Diana, and the &rand air with variations (in French " Je veux bnser mes chaines") of the second act-where Catarina unexpectedly appears in the drawingroom of the Count ds Campo Mayor-as examples of vocal proficiency not to be excelled. In these and indeed throughout the opera, Miss Pyne raised the audience to enthusiasm, convincing aU who were able to form an opinlon that the English stage possessed a singer of the very highest accomplishments. If her talent is of the plastio nature, and can lend itself as readily to the interpretation of other styles (of which her emphatic and forcible delivery of a verse in the national anthem later in the evening encourages the hope), we shall have rained a prize. There is only one reproach to address to Mmss Pyne, and that in some measure calls her judgment into question. Instead of the originalalrofCataring(ActIIL)she presented a song called " The Skylark," composed, we believe, by fr. Benedict for Senny Lind;- while at the end of the opera she did even worse violence to the composer's design, by introducing Rode's air with variations, just after ex. Ining the enigma of the diamonds to her lover Don Henrique. Anything more antagonistic to the style of Anber's music than this Antiquated piece of "sol-fa-ing" could hardly be found, and falser than the crown jewels themselves was the taste involved in such an innovation. It mattered little to real lovers of music (whose applause should be coveted by such Artists as 5iss Pyne) howc these interpolations were sung, or how they gratified the unreflecting cro,wd. It is enough that they were ridicnlrusly out of place, and that such liberties should raver be taken with works of genius. Mr. W. Harrison acts the part of Don Hourique with infinitely more point and natural expression than of old, and sings the muslo much in the same manner. He, too, regaled the audience with a choice ballad on the music-shop pattern, that jostled unpleasantly against the we -sustained plan of Auber's score, the admirable unity of which could not but suffer from such common-place intrusions. Mr. Harrison was received with all the honounrs usually lavished on an acknowledged public favourite. For the subordinate parts we have nothing but praise. Miss Susan Pyne, as Diana, was a thoroughly efficient second to her talented sister, and in the duet of the ball scene fairly merited a share of the plaudits so lavishly bestowed. Mr. Hamilton Braham's Rebolledo chief of the coiners), -Mr. St. Albyn's Don Sebastian, and Mr. G. Honey's Campo Mayor, were all good, and the more entitled to eulogy from the fact that the iniportant parts assigned to these personages in the concerted music were without exception well executed. The finales to the first and second acts were most effectively given ; while the delicious quintet in F, In the lAst scene, exhibited the musical qualificationw of all concerned in a highly favourable light. The whole performance created satisfaction withon' aUoy, and the applauns was hearty ard incessant. After the opera the national anthem was sung by the entire company -Madame Caradori and Mr. Weiss (in addition to Miss Louise Pyne, to whoee share in the loyal hymnn allusion has been made) taking the solo verses. The entertainments con. eluded with the farce of t -Rough Diao .ndi Meyerbeser's Hugucnots is announced for to-night.
BmKzxnzADx, Sept. 20.-The portlon of the Mediterrnean Extension Telegaph Company's cable already completed, consisting of 6S28 miles, was tested on f hy M~. yr. V. pl or io ph 5i..oo,r, an la. Andrews, superintendent to the Mediterranean Company. The testing of the entire length of the cable was most satlsfactory. With only two cells of a small sand battery a distinct signal was obtained, and with four cells uninterrupted telegraphic communication was maintained, and messages were transmitted by means of the single needle instrument throughout the entire length; thus demonstrating the perfect electrlcal integrity of the conducting wire. The new line will connect Cagliari with Malta and Corfu, and the entire length to be manufactured will consist of nearly 1,000 miles. The Mess. Newall, by whom the cable is being made, expect to finish the work by the middle of October, and the whole line will be submerged by the end of that month. The cable consists of a single oonducting wire with an onter protective sheath of iron wimre; but the outer wires, unlike those of the Atlantic Company's cable, are not subdivided into a number of small filaments, but each strand is a solid mass and distinct in itself. The greatest caution has been exercised at each stage of the manufacture. The gutta percha wire, consisting of two distinct coverlngs, has been supplied by the Gutta Percha Company, and every portion has been delivered to the Messrs. Newall in a psrfect state and free from all blemish; but the Messrs. Newall have subjected every portion so delivered to further and severe testing in water under hydraulic pressure, so that no possible means have been left untried by them to turn out a really perfect cable. We understnd that the Messrs. Newall have undertaken to lay down the cable throughout the entire Ingth, and to maintain it in working order for a certain specified time and for a given sum of noney, and if they should fail in doing this the loss will be theirs, the CompanD by the terms of their agreement, being protected from all harm. We therefore entertain no fear but that our important military stations in the Mediterranean will be within a few minutes' call from the mother country in the course of next month, [Advertisement.]-."

CREMOAUR WED-V, i The ermination of the Ciumorne ibmon with the een1 week may be regarded ae a sort of offiial declrtion on the. part ofthe more lively portion of the London publie tbat hummer is fairly orer. People pas down to Creore by multitudes is long as the stete of the weather renders th&e migration poesible; the heat that makte theatre inuferablo" Invites to the out-door enjoyments of the agndJ from Whituntido to tbo end of Septembe tere% now plaoe of amusement more popular. Circmst;ances have given the proprietor all the advantages of a monopoly, Vauxhall, after several spumodle. flickering, hus farly faded out, nor even if It were re-- opened by an enterpridng speculator would it prove a eompetitor equslto Crem8orne. The older gardens, planted with. dark arenuee, that shut out the light of day, are arranged fornight amusements only, and derive their sole brightnessfrom. aticial means of IlluminatIon; whereas Cremorne, with.- its broad lawns, its picturesque points of view, Its fount,int and itb statues, affords a moat agreeable lounge fn theafternoon, without sacrificing any of ita qualifications forbeco2ring a land of lamps after nightfalL The SurreyGardens, notwithsbanding the excellence of the now fusioball, and the advantag;a of a lake that afforded an opportunity for the display ol a peculiar description of fireworks not to be found elsewhere, have not met patronage enough to. become a permanent establishmente; nossi,bly because a. situation ' over the water" counterbalances all the good, that can be effected by any amonnt of taste and enterprise. Moreover,the Surrey Gardens from the first beginning, whenm they made their appeance as a zoological inAitution were addressed to a graver class than Cremorne, aunl even if they had flourished they could scarcely have, rivalUed it in the estimation of the moet numerous patrong of out-door amusements. There are, indeed, varions public-. gardens In the different outskirts of tie metropolis, and, If report may be trusted, many of them arc ably and respet-. ably conducted; but these enjoy a locul rather than a.- general celebrity, and do not even attempt a oompetition. with the large gardens of Chelsea. Cremorne is the onlr place of outdoor gaiety that is recognized all over London, and frequented alke by high and humble. Gardens known: to all Paris are numerous,-there is but one Cremorne. Fsr from making an undue use of the monopoly that circuimstances have thrust upon him, Mr. Simpson has manzge& his property with as much zeal for the amusement of the publ'o as if a whole legion of oompetitors were arrayet .gainsthim. Every seasonthegardenisembellishedwithsome new ornament, and enlivened with some new description of entertainment. Thero is an equestrian yrcus; there is a theatre for the performance of ballets; there is a marionette - theatre; there s a cosmorama; there re opportunitles for the practtoe of marksmanship in all it5 formg, from rifleshooting and American bowls down to "ringing the bnllm and the slaughter of kin stags with a pop-gun; and finally there are reireshment rooms, which, notwitbstann the natural tendency of man to be sensitive as to allthat regards his palate, havo never, we believe, awakened a grumble. In short, it is hard to saT what Cremorne doe. not present in the shape of open-air recreation The amusement-seekers of London will, under there circumstances, regret to learn that a cloud is at present hanging over the forhmes of Cremorne. I o many of our more joyous readers the Chelsea Elysiumn wm appear such a ventable eeat of delight that they will be totally unable to understand that a different view is taken of the matter by the Chelsea vestry Puzzling indeed' to the multitude that go rattling down to Cremorne in brougham, cab, and carriage will be the explanation that rents are lowered by immediate vicinity to the Gardens. ' Who would not pay double rent to live next door toCremorne, and compensate for the outlay by the saving of coach hire ?" so will argue rmany a wearer of a downy moustache; but his argument wllU not convinco the small portioR of the Chelsea vestrymen who are now invading the privileges of Cremorne, At present the assault merely takes the form of an "early cloeir movement," and the licensing magistrates aretoie requested to shut up Mr. Simpson by half-past 11 o'dock. " 1 to bed and early to rise" is, no doubt, a wholesome motto for those who can adopt it; but its cogency is slight in the eyes of policemen, opera-dancers, West-end oyster-shop proprietors, manufacturers of fireworks, and many other persons of virtuons professions, to whom we may add in a body the amateurs, reputable and disreputable, who cultivatc, the worship of Terpsichore. We are not aware that there is any Greek myth setting forthsome mystic arrangement between Kronosand the most ppular of muses in order to account for tho eonnexion etween dancing and late hours, but certan it is that from. the days when Horace could say- " Jam Cytherea choros ducit Vensus, imminente Luna," down to the present sober time dancers of everyclass, whether they fre9uent the lax casino or exhibit their predilections at the qmet little family ball of a puritanical suburb, seem all to make their conduct a practical expression of that individual liberty which is so often shouted forth in the chorus, "We won't go home till morning " In all robability the cloud will pass over; but if it should brea over Cremorne, and the monster platform and the supper-room become solemn deserts at half-past 11, then will the now joyous multitude that flows through the avenues of Chelsea wend sorrowvfully home at early midnight, asking why 'the mirth of the metropolis is thus brought to an early close. In what form did the angry gods manifest themselves who. dashed away the lam?s from the Temple of the Muses an i the races7 And Cho, tmuse of history, will reply,-Im the form of 18 vestrymen.
THE MAIL STEAMASHIPS. TO THE EDITORI OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Very soon after the Busdan war broke out, and when the necessity was made quite clear to the country that our small army in the Crimea required large reinforcements, and that with all despatch, I ventured to address Sir James Graham, and to remind him that, by contract, tho whole steam fleets of the Royal West India Mlail as well s the Cunard Companies vere at his command. Sir James replied courteously, encouraging me to correspond, and I furnished him with a list of paddle and screw steam ships, the greater portion of which the Admiralty at once chartered. I was a spectator this week of a field day in the Phanix Park here, and conld not but desire that the splendid troops of every arm in Her Majesty's service that were that day inspected were at oneo put on board the Persia (which can cross an ocean in nine days), the Arabia, and the Ia Plata, and that, leaving smaller and slower vessels to carry the mail bags for a time, these swift and powerful steamers were ,owv carrying salvation to our oonutrymen, their wives and, children, in India. It is strange that our Government, with so much in their power, should still, in the face of this emergenoc in India, not put in operation the aforementioned clause m the oonracts between the Admiralty, the Cuuard Company, and the other mail comparies There are also the New York, the Edinburgh, and tho Glasgow, large screw steamships, running between Clyde and New York, and belonging to Messrs Tod and 'Gregor, of Glasgow, that did good service in the Rassian war, amt which surely could be chartered at a reasonable amounts. There are, besides, the Kangaroo and tho City of Baltimore, of a similar class, belonging to 3messrs Richardson. of Liverpool, who have already given the City of Manchester to this ssrvice. Let neither time be lost nor expense spared in this crisis, the magnitude of which is now painfully disclosed. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. n i.r ATQ= 24, Arran Quay, Dublin, Sept. 19.

TRiAL TiTP oF THs AunRASI .--SorTEAvPTON, Monday.-The new screw steamer Australalan, recently built on the Clyde for the Australian mail line, went out for a trial trip to-day, with a lrge party of scienti6c gentlemen on board.

Portsmonth, Admiralty Surveors; Captain Ramsay, Admlralty Superintendent of Mil-packets at Southampton; Lieutenant O'RelUy, deputy ditto; Mr. Lock, manager of the European and Australian Compsny - ;Ir.

Ritchie, the superintending engineqr: If - bnperfLding engmeer at ,t. Thomas s: Captain Strmtt, the oompany's examiner, &c. The Australaslan steamed out of the docks about 11 o'clock, a large number of syeCtstors being assembled to witness her departure, and proceeded rapidly down the Southampton water and the Solent to Stoke's Bay, where her speed was tested by the measured mile. She, passed Calshot Castle, about seven miles, in a few seconds over balf an hour from the time of leaving the dockls. At the measured nile four trials were made, with the foRowing results, the first and third mile being with the tide, and the other two against:-No. 1, in 4 minutes 7 seconds, equal to 14575 miles per hour; 44 revolutlons. No. 2, in 5 minutes 2 seconds, equal: to ,921 miles per hour; 45 revolutions. No. 3, in 4. minutes 15 seconds, equal to 14-118 miles per hour- 44revolutions. No. 4, in 4 minutes 52 seconds, equai to, 12-329 miles per hour; 44 revolutions. Averag upee& 13325 miles per hour;* ship drawing 21 feet of water, and& about L200 tons weight on board. The results were considered highly satisfactory, and give good promise of what: this noble vesselvwill be able to do. After the trial the, steamer proceeded down the Solent towards the Needles, and' the party on board adjourned to the spacious saloon, wherethey patook of a cold, coUlation of the most r6cdierchb character. the Austraasian returned into the river, and the party wero landed in the docks a few minutes after 5- o'clock. Tho weather was beautifully fine, and all on board greatly enjoyed the trip. Having already given a full description of the arrangements of this magnifoent steamship, It is needless to say more than that her splendid fittings and.' I powerful machinery excited the admiration of every viditor. In taking a survey of the vessel wre penetrated into>. the boiler room, which of itself is a perfeot cmriosity, having a range of 15 furnaces on either aide of a long avenue, giving one the strongest possible evidence of the power brougnt to bear in the propulsion of this fine specimen of the shipbuilder's art.
