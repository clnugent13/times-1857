I T:HE NBW LAW OF PROBATE.* Itis generally supposed that the new Probate Act will come into operation on the 1st of January next. Although the order in Council, which must precede by one month the day on which the Act is to become the law of the land, has not yet been Issued, still It is understood in well-informed quarters that its operation will not be delayed beyond that day. The Court of Probate and the privilege of proving wills and obtaining admitistration will then be no more confined to a section of the legal profession, but It will be competent to every one whose name is on the rol of attorneys or solicitors, as weU as those who retain the more classical designation of proctors, to undertake the conduct of all business connected with the probate of wills or grants of administr&tion; nay, each individual executor or next of kin may do all that is required in the matter without profesional aid, subject to such checks agatnst fraud and the observance of such formalities as may be prescribed by the rules and orders of the Judge of the Court of Probate. How far the old adage denoancing the wisdom of so doing will prevail to prevent such a step must be left to the discretion of the parties themselves. The publication beforeus, then, comes at an opportune moment. It is not every onewho furnishes himself with a copy of the statutes passed in each session; stiUl les is the wish universal to dive into their mysteries or to endeavour to unravel the intricacies of legislative language. The Act before us, passed as it was hastily at the end of the session, and dealing with a subject which Parliament had for nearly a quarter of a century in vain endeavoured to alter, and with strong prejudices to encounter and conflicting interests to reconcile, bears, indeed, evidence of haste and want of due consideration; still the improvements it has introduced, and its abolition of an authority so long denounced as incompatible with the feelings or habits of the age-viz., " the dominion of the church over the effects of the dead," must reconcile us to its imperfections. The chief object of the author appears to have been to classify the sectionsunder the subject-matter to which they relate, and to point out the most important changes which the statute has introduced-for example, the establishment of district registries throughout the country in!which probate or administrationp may be had without resort to the central court in London, save in cases of controversy; the power of the County Court to adjudicate in certain cases, extending probate to wills of real estate; and the appointment of official administrators by the Court. These are the prominent features of the Aot, and as such they are ably explained and commented upon by Dr. Waddilove. The practice of the court can only be shown by the rules and orders of the judge. They have not yet made their appearance, but it wiUl be seen by the author's preface that, when issued, they wil be published uniformly with this treatise. * 27 Act to Amend the Law retating to Probates and LeUters of Adrnini.strati,)n in Eng7and (20th and 21st Victeria, cap. 77), ith a Rteriew and Classification of the Scotions, showing7 lhe Changes introduced in matters of Pro. e and Administration, by Alfred Waddilove, D.O.S. , Advocate In Docters'-co,nmons, and of the Inner Temple, Barriser-at-li.a.

A STRsoAx STo}Ry.-The New York papers report a very extraordinary and painful affair which has lately become public there. Some time ago a Mrs. Woodman, wife of a wealthy New Orleans merchant, while on a visit to Paris, became acquainted with an American adventurer, one of the New York fashionables, named Gardner Fmrness, aud the acquaintance was assiduously prosecuted by him both on the continent and after the return of the parties to America. Mr. Furness, it seems, not satisfied with seducing the wife, was desirous of replenishing his purse at the expense of the unsuspecting hasband. With infernal cruelty and perseverauce he succeeded in gaining perfect mastery over tho actons and very thoughts of his unhappy victim, vwho found herself compeled to saorifice her jewels and the liboral sutms allowed her by her husband, absent in the South, without at all satisfying the rapacious greed of her persecutor. She fled to her friends inthe South. but threats of an exposure induced her to return to lNew York and to her paramour. Shortly after her return, however, the long. dreaded d4nofincnt occurred. The injured husband returning unexpectedly to his room in the New York Hotel, discovered Furness there in company with his wife. The heartless deceiver made a very ridiculous exit, and the matter afforded subject for the usual gossp. Bat Mr. Woodman being called to New Orleans on business, an d desirous of putting a constraint upon his misguided, weak-minded wife, placed her in a private lunatic asylum In Flushing, where she was detained untiLI a few days ago. A petition was presented to Judgo Roosevelt as the basis for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, requiring the proprietor of the lunatic asynlm to produce the lady in court. This petition was promoted on behalf of Mr Woodman by Furness, her paramour. The counsel on the other side, who opposed the petition on behalf of the proprietor of the asylum, produced the affidavits of Dra Barstow and bterrich, stating Mrs. Woodman to have been placed In the asylum by her husband in consequence of her being in an excited and wandering state of mind, and furthermore testifying to the uniform kindness with which she had been treated during her confinement in thatplace. A communication was also read from Mrs. Woo=an asking a stay of proceedings In the case untiL the arrival of her father or brother from New Orleans. The counsel for the petitioner, In answer to the above-mentioned affidavits, read letters from Mrs. Woodman to Mr. Furnss, written during her confinement in the asylum, earnestly imploring hlm to help her to get out, and complaining that she was kept there in pri gon by her husband as a punishment, or, as she said, "for his revenge." She addressed Furness in these letters in the most endearing terms of blandishment, and expressed a desperate affection for him, entreating "Babie,"ac she wantonly called him, to contdve the means of her release from theasylum,where she declared herself to be utterly miserable. She said, "You cannot imagine what an awful place this is; the outside is quite elegant, but that is alL Do not forgake me; at once do something for me if you can; but be careful and never let any one know I have written to you until I am out. If Icried it would give them pleasure, as all the maniacs scream and cry. I hate them so much I would not look sad to save them from where they ought to be-the d-l." The unhappy woman, if she wrote these letters, earnestly protested that she was not deranged, or "crazy," and claimed, If she were really so, to be p laced in a public Institutlon, where a proper medical certificate of her insanity would be required. These letters, when produced in court, excited a great deal of compassion for her. The ease was adjourned, and at the next hearing the counsel for the proprietor of the asylum tendered In evidence an affldavit sworn to by Mrs. Woodman on the 1st of September lat, in which she gave the history of the persecutions she had endured from Furrness after her roturn to America in 1855, and down to last August. She stated that he had folowed her fromNewv York to New Orleans, extorting money from her, taking away her jewels, and compelling her to sell her embroldery and dresses to supply his demands, under pain of being exposed by him, and being disgraced and discarded by her husband. The following is a specimen:-" He caUed on me repeatedly for more money, and upon my refusing t-X lye it him he threatened to show to Mr. Woodman the letters which I had written him, and also a portrait of me which he bad. He told me the letters which I had written him would cause Mr. Woodman to discard me, and that he (Mr. Furness) would disgrace and ruin me unless I let him have aU the money I could get. I had during that period an alowance from my husband of $100 per month, aU of which I gave Mr. Furness; he called on me for money to pay blis board bill, which he said was abont $280. I had no money and told him so, upon which he not only threatened me but actuaUy beat me with violence, broke open my wardrobe, and took away myjewelry and valuable laces." He frequently boat her, and on one occa-ion almost strangled her in her own room. " During the last interview," she said, ' Furness urged me to get ihe money by making out false bills and getting the money from Mr. Woodman, or by taking jewelry, Also he insisted that he know my father had giveni me $2,500 to buy diamonds or silver, and he was determined to have it. When he found he could not get money he used violence, as I have stated. He said, ' Your husband and your brother are cominghere; there'll bo a fuss; and I mean to rmin you first, and put you in the gutter, where I shall be. I hate you, and hate aU your family, because you won't behave to me as you should." He wrote to her letters of the most insolent kind, alternating, however, with high-flown professions of his love. By thWs sort of treatment the seducer had succeeded, for two yesrs, in obtaining fromt his victim very considerable sums, and indulged In every luxury at her expense. The' case having ibeen again ad3ourned, was suddenly brought to a conclusio n, wrhen the counsel for the proprietor of the asylum pproduced the two following letters from Mrs. Woo'man, which he read to the Court. The first was addressed to the judge, the Hon. James J. Roosevelt:-" I wish the proceedings before you commenced by M-r. Furness in relaton to me to be discontinued and ended. I am notIn any way restrained of my liberty. Beingentirely free, I intend to retire at once to the home of my parents in Mississippi, v,ith my brother, C. L, Tomas, who is now present.-CARjOLTm-E WOOnasx.S Nov. 3, 1857." The second was the following:-" Since being an inmate of Sanford-hall I have been treated by the general and doctor with great kindness, and also by every one connected with the house.-C.ROLrNE WOODMAN. Nov. 4, 1857." The reading of these document5 producei a sensation in court which can be better imagined than described, and the Court and all concerned in the case seemed immensely relioved, The writ of habeas corpus was then discharged, and the Court adjourned, the affair being over. PcIrKiLLmN( UNDER CHLOROFOR1.-One day last week a patient in the Kendal vorkhouse had to undergo a painful surgical process, for the performance of which the application of chloroform was judged needful by the operator. It happened to be the pig-killing day, of which the indication was loudly apparent, when it occurred to the worthy practitioner to sugge4t the sameopiate to the doomed grunter. The hint was actel n pon, the soonge applied to the animal's nostrils, and In a moment he was as quiet as a lamb. Ina this unsuspecting condition the poor victim had the knife applied to his throat, and with a resullt every way as satistactory and complets as under the old and accredlted mode of slaughter.-CcvlisPe Eraminea'.

THE POOR LAW. TO TEHE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-A- some misunderstanding appears to be generally prevalent respecting the order of the Poor Law Board4 regulating the administration of relief to the labouring clases in the manufacturing and other popiuous pl5ces, Y forward a copy of the general order, dated the 14th of December, 1852, which contains their regulations on thb subject. it will be seen that this order, isned to about 90* unions and 15 parishes, including among others the Prestore Union, does not prohibit the granting of outdoor relief t% the ablebodied poor, nor require th6t they should sll b% relieved in the workhouse; but it provides that where able, bodied male persons are relieved out of the workbousX they shaU be set to work and be kept employed while 1m receipt of relief. Exceptions are e3htblished which meet many cases arising in such emergencies as at present, and am additional article gives a much larger latitude to boards Oc gnardians in the execution of the order, subject to intervenL tion on the part of the Poor law Board, should they find 1 necessary to interfere. I am, Sir, your obedient servan: W. G. LUIJEY. Gwydir-house, Nov. 26.

HERVEY IARRIS GREATHED.- Hervey Harrls Greathed, born August 31, 1S17, was secondr son of Mr. Edward Greathed, of Uddens-house, Dorset,, and of Mary Elizabeth, daughter of the late Sir Ricbard. Carr Glyn, and was marrled on the 12th of December, 1S44, to Eliza Frances, daughter of Mr. T. J. Turner, B.C.S. Mr. Greathed commenced his career In India in 1S36, ant after fUling vadous official situations In the Puuj%b; Rajpootana, and at Meerut, was appointed Commaissioner oi Delhi, in succession to Mfr. Fraser, who was massacred at the commencement of the revolt. In this capacity he acc companied the troops commanded by Sir Archdale WIhsoz on their march from Meerut to Delhi, was present at the battle of Gazeoodeennuggur on the Hindon, and was with tha camp before Delhi throughout the siege. In his early days ha had been offically connected with the Sikh chieftains vwhQi occupy the territory in the rear of our besieging army., Thus, while his perfect acqualntance with them uand thoir resources greatly contributed to securo cordial co-operatiort from that important quarter, he made also every snitablcx arraugement calculated to call forth those exertions li zealous officers which have preserved in so much securt the fertile districts on the other or the east side of the river Jumna, forming the Merut division lately under his chlej civil charge. During our arduous struggle before the walls of Delhi his tone was uniformly encouraging. All the authorities near and distant, were reassured by his me esa and despatches, the language of which clearly indlcatedXhC certain progress of the British arms towards a glorious suca cess In 'm were combined the qualities of a sounti judgment, truth, great abilities, and a thorough manl% character. His remarkable strength and stature gava promise that hi constitution would continue to reslst the ordinary eTfects of the performLance of laborioue duties In a tropical climate, but it succumbed, as in the casa of others on the same heights of Delhi, to a sudden attack oE diseaso, aggravated by anxiety of mind during the progress of the assault on the city. This excellent public servant hacT two brothers also present at the siege. One of these, bdlong4 ing to that distinguished band of engineers, has been carrioa' wounded to the mountains. The other has gone in com* mand of the strong column -whicb, after the capture of! Delhi, -was sent in pursuit of the rebels down the line of thc river Jumna.

PROSECiTION OF THE PRIESTS. The Freeman's Journal throws out a delieate feeler, which, it is to be presumed, will not escape -the attention of the sympathizers of Mr. Conway. It appears that the rev. gentleman has had several -communlcations in reference to pecuniary assistance -towards defraying theheavy expenditurerequisite for :lia defence. Mr. Conway, however, has deelined personally receiving any subsciptions whatever-a course which elicits the marked approbation of the Dublin organ.

Doyle"which -was argued darlng the present term, was fixed for Judgment yesterday in the Court of Comiion Pleas. The decision of the Court being adverse to the plaintiff the creditors of the bank will be losers to the extent of several thousands of pounds. Mhe facts are thus briefly recapitulated by the Lord ICbief Justice:- " The question raised wa a most important one; the 4ourt.had, however, been enabled to arrive at a unanimous llecision upon it. The case came before them upon - demurrer taken by the plaintiff to one of the defences filed by the defendant, sad the facts relied -esn were shortly these:-It appred that the plainflff in the suit was Mr. George M`Dowell, the official manager of the Tipperary Joint-Stock Bank, and slefendant was a poor farmer in the county of Tipperary 2aaed Doyle; andctheformerhad brought his actionragainst the latter to recover the Bum of 81., the amount of a promilssory Dote which was overdue, and by which the defendant prouised to pay Mr. James Sadleir the amount when due. lThe defence filed was to theeffect that the promissory note in euestion was never endorsed, and that it was made payable to 'Ir.JamesSadleir or order, and did not show that Air. Sadleir Leld any official situation in connexton with the Tipperary 33ank, and that therefore the plaintiff, as official manager, was not entitled to sue upon foot of it. Tothis defence Mr. IM'Dowell had filed a demurrer, and raised an Important -question as to whether the defendant, by his note made payasble to Mr. Sadleir, was not liable in an action at his suit, 4s Mr. Sadleir was the manager of the bank when the note was passed. It was argued that when a contract was made with an agent for a principal, the principalmight intervene nmd maintain an action for his own benefit; but no case was *-mied to show that in a negotiable instrument, payable to A A. B, or order,' that anybody but 'A. B.' could 3maintain an action. The opinion of the Court was that the right to be was only vested in the party to whom the note was rayable, and that, consequently, the official manager could amot maintain bis action. Such beingl the opinion of the Court, the order would be to overrule the demurrer, with Vests."1 THE LATE TEA FRAUDS. The Belfast Mercury of yesterday contains the Mubjoined statement:- "M Mr. Andrew Harbison, who, it will be recollected, was nccused, along with Mr. Henley, of aiding and assisting -John James Moore In his frauds upon the Customs, was ,yestes day liberated from custody in the County of Antrim rison, to which he was committed, in default of bail, after he investigationin the Town-hallonthel4thofOctoberlast.

RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE. LANCASHIRE AND YORMSHERE AND EAST LANCASHIRE. Yesterday, at a meeting of the Preston town-council, Mr. Alderman Catterall said, there was no doubt that if the companies got tbeir Act of amalgamation they would have it in their power, up to the maxrimum tolls, to charge whatever they pleased for carriage between Preston and Manchester and other places on their lines. It seemed to him that when two large companies such as they were had hitherto been to a certain extent opposed to each other, and that by reason of that opposition and competltion the pablic had had an advantage, it behoved the public, when that competition was about to cease, to combine for the protection of their own interests. (Hear, hear.) This was not a question solely affecting the corporation; it affected the tradesmen of the town and neighbourhood in a very large degree, and also the people of other towns and nelghbourhoods through which these railways ran. The tradesmen of the town should take an active part in the matter, and appoint a committee to watch the progress of the Bill. If they did not do so, when the amelgamnation Bill had passed, they would find themselves entirely in the bands of one great railway company. (Eear, hear.) He then gave notice that at the next meeting he would move for the appointment of a committee. WATERFORD AND EILKENNY. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yes. terday at the London Tavern, Mr. 0. R. Colman in the chair. Mr. Parker, the secretary, read the report, an abstract of which has appeared in The Times. The CissArmAN, in moving the adoption of the report, said he would congratulate them on the increase of the revenue of the company were it not for the difficulty as to what should be done with respect to the demand of the Public Works Loan Commin oners. In the report the directors had fuUy explained the position of the company with respect to the loan and debenture debt. Some correspondence had taken place between the company and the Loan Commissioners, w'th a view to a practicable arrangement, under the circumstances, but without effect. He then read a letter from the Earl of Bessborough, the chairmau of the company, apologizing for his absence on that occasion, but stating that he was quite satisfied to bear his share of any blame that might attach to the directors for not meeting the requirements of the Loan Commissioners. He thought the directors were not to blame for the present position of the company, and that in the existing state of the money-market it was scarcely poscible for the Loan Commissioners to take such extreme measures as they had intimuated-nimely, that of seizing and selling the line by public auction. He hoped the representations oi the directors and the circumstances in which the company was placed would have some weight with them. Mfr. Powwa, a direotor, said that nothing of a private nature had prevented the Earl of Bessborough taking the chair on that occasion. He was now engaged in Dnblin In the performance of his duty as trustee for the creditors in the matter of the Tipperary Bank; being a very large creditor he wrs recently appointed to represent them, and to act with the official manager in winding up the affairs. Mr. ROPER objected to the proposition of the Loan Comms oners for taking the whole of the net receipts of the line, leaving the debenture holders without their interest. He thought nothing could be more fatal than that course, as it would deprive the company of the only meaus they possessed of transferring the debt from the Loan Commissioners to debenture holders. The traffic on the line was increasing, and he thought when it was further developed a very lrge inoreae in their receipts would be the result. Were it not for the state of the money-market and the high rate of interest, he thought there would be no difficulty in raising the 100,0001. to pay off the sum borrowed from the Loan Commissioners, particularly as the company had expended above half-a-million on their railway and works. He thought a deputation from the directors should have explained these matters ho the commissioners. The CssArsm9wx said, the comm issioners had refused to ese the directors or any deputation. They had waited on Mr. Wilson, the Secretary of the Treasury, but he declined to interfere in the matter. 1&. PARKER then read the correspondencethat had taken place between the company and the commissioners, from which it appeared that the company had paid interest on the loan up to a recent date, and had also repaid 21,0001. of the principal to the commnissioners. The company were willing to appropriate the whole of the net receipts to paying off the principal and interest of the commissionera' loan, with the exception of about 1,600. s-year-the amount of interest oa the company's debentures-and, as the traffic was increasing, the sum available for the commissioners' loan would likewise increase in amount in each succeeding year. The commis- ioners required the whole anmount of the net receipts and quarterly accounts, and that the company should hand over the balance every three months. It was explainod t* the commissioners that 100 personx held the debeantres of the copany, and that the withholding of the interest on the debentures when due would seriously affct the credit of the coniPany, and render it impossible for them to raise any snore money. The C1IAiRmLt remarked that the utmost they could do with the commiissioners was to have the proceedings fetayed Unltil af ter tlhe pre-Sent ;.neeting. In reply to questions, he stated that the average rate of interest paid on their debentures was 5.1 per cent. They wanted 9,OOO1. for the Loan Comnmissioners, 3,0007. to pay a loan from their bankers, -who were pressing, and also money to meet debentures fallin u,altogether about 20,0001. would enabete og onutlthe end of next year. They had uneihausted borrowing povwers to th exetof 15,0001. Mr. Rreairsoyobjetedt the directors receiving anythig fr rmunraton while the company was In difficulies an sugesedthat 20,0001. should be raised by the Mr. ELAI~~gycomplained of the large expenditurao capial rom imeto time, and suggested that the Loa Commssioers houd have their way by taking the whole of he et ecepts and until things improved he advisedl tecompany t raiethe 1,600. sa-year for the Interest on deentures, either by issuing debentures to that amount, or bysome other maeans. If they would only transfer theo management to Ireland, he had no doubt they would be able to raise in the district all the money they required at romething like 4per cent, Their receipts h&d nearly doubled sinoe 1854, and it they could get their line extended about 40 miles towards Ballinasoe, they would then have a remaunerative traffic over their line to Waterford. M1r. RADCLI-FS.E explainted that the Earl of Beiborough, the chairman, and direcetors, had exerted themselves in every way to place the company in a good position. Af ter a long and noisy discussion, the report andl tate Imentof accounts were adopted. SZ On the motion of Mr. RoPri, seconded by Mr. Sw.AY, a reGolution was carried to the effeot that It was undes1rnb!e to adopt the proposition of the lcommissoners, as It would prevenit the transfer of the loanu to other parties, and that a deputation from the directors he requested to represent the mnatter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, 'with a view to obtain some better arrangement. Mr. AiDAIes proposed, that a com-mittee of five preference shareholders and two original shareholders be appointed to confer with the directors and assist them to carry outt such measues as mliiht be deemd no5a with power to call a meeting as ear aposble. The motion wAs adopted, the committee appointed, and the meeting separated. BELFAST AND BALLYMENA. The report of the directors of this company states that the receipts show a fair increase over the prevlous halfyear; buLt as the extension to Cookstown has not been 12 months opened for traffic, no comparIson can he drawn between the past and any corresponaing half of former years. The tota receipts for traffic during the past six months, ending the 3Slt of October, amouanted to 33,8011., includling 18,3751. for passengers; and 13, 9187. for goods. The workdin expenses, have decreased, and the rolling stock is in god workingorder. Therenewal of the prmanent way has been extenisively carried on during the hafy ear, and has entailed a heavy expenditure out of the reserved fund. The directors recommend that 4,0761. be placed to the credit of that account, making the total at this date 10,0001.

STATE OF TRLDE. BRADFORD, Nov. 26. There has been a fair attendance at our maarket to.day, but trade Is still inanimate. The feel of doubt and apprehenslona caused by the monetary crisi Is in a gre&at neasure gone. Still there is left behind a certain kindct of gloom which it Is difficult to cast off, and particularly after the failures thot have occurred within the last few days. The suspension of the Northumberland and DPrham Bank has assisted to prolong this state of feeling; and the failures at Hamburg, though they may not affect this market in anv direct way, have had a similar influence. Tho sales that have taken place to-day in wools, worsted yarns, and pieces bave been altogether trifling in extent, as only those who are under the necessity of selling consent to accept the lower prices that purchasers offer. All round Bradford sbort-tiue working is going on, and spinners and manufacturers who have been rzunning their machinery four days a-week are now reducing their production still further. Pauperism Is gradually inereasing in this district. From the returns of the Bradford Board of Guardians it appears that on the 15th of October last there were 2,466 paupers on the books, including 357 in the workhouse. On he 2th inst. the total number of paLupers on the books was 3,113, including 578 indoor. There was an increase of 176 in the number of persons relieved in the week ending he 1th iDst., as COmpared ith the corresponding aeek of last year. The manufaceturlng population in the neighbourhood of lKeighicy are suflering from the great depression intrade. The wiorsted factories there are running SOme of themn four, and others only three. days a-week,
&USPEArSION of the NORTH UMBERLAND andt DURHiAM DISTRICT BANK. N., NBWCASTLE.ON-TYNE,. THunsnDAr FORZKOON. itsubrmanc asna IjurIsam listrict Bank in this town, With its branches in Shields, Sunderland, and the other towns, as announced to you by telegraph, closed its doors this morning. Tho followving notice was posted up on the doors of the branches at 10 o'clock -nhe Dbitrlet Bank sezrete to announce that It has received order' from the head offlce tD clowe its doors. "Deposits and credit accuDnt wll be faUy paid, wlthas It'tle de ay as possible. A meeting of the shareholders will be lnnendateJy The excitement in the district is fearful, as thebankis con. nected with collieries, ironworks, iron shipbuUdingconcorns and other large works. That some of those concerns must stop immediately appears to be inevitable. At thismoment It is impossible to conjectture what will bo the result of the stoppage to theshareholders and depositors. The depositors appear to be safe, as the proprietary is wealthy; but it is no secret that the bank has made large advances to speculative concerns in the district. The branches of the bank are at Sanderland, Alnwick, Worth and South Shields, Berwick, Hexhpm, Morpeth, and Darham. The trade of the whole of those towns will be fearfuly embarrassed by the stoppage, as the principal shipowners and agriculturists kept their aceounts with the branches, and manutfacturers and colliery owners drew the wages for their workmen, and transacted the principal part of their business there. In fact, the " District" has been the leading bank in the northern division of Darham and the entire county of Northumberland since the Union and North of England Banks stopped In 1847. Great efforts are being made to prevent a pani and a run upon the other banks, and so far they have to a large extent succeeded. The other banks of the town and nelghbourhood seem sound and confident, and the "District" has closed its doors without any ran having taken place upon either it or any of the other banks. With respect to the state of affairs here, the lVorthezre Express says - "Itis true that the Northumbeslaud anD Darham Dlitrlt Bank ha suspendedp ayment without auy srn being ma3e upou it. We are not in the confidenoe of its director,, and do not know what has pre cipitated the cridsi; but It is quite possible that Its stoppage, without any publio premsure, nay faclitate a settlement of its affairs.

They at leut re not overwhelmol by a sene of their lIabItle ; and we think we ooul I mention a few names among Its shareholders that would anywhere, in these nortbern counties, be regarded as a s afficient guarantee that de . posltors would not lose a penny, and that under the mogt nufaroturabe Ciroumst noes all that they will Srufer wil be a temporary Inoanyeience. "Wears assured, on the most reliable authority, that the otbhe banks in the town and dlstrict are tborougaly sound. With almost inexhaustible mineral wealth and the coal trade thriving there is no part of tbe country that abould bs loss affetted by the dearness and carctty of money than the North of England; and there could be no great:r madnem than. by any want of confluenoe and care, to bring our property in mines into themarket at a time when property of every claw is Iso deDreciated in value; aud thus threw thousands out ot work during the Inclemency of tbe winter, Every merobant and every mechardc in the North of England should feel thst they have a commnon interestr to the utmost of their power. ln preventinsa reul t that wonld be frausht with such dizater to all. It is by a commaon undeestandIng, a mutnal forbearance and confidonce, that such a calamilty can be averteLd We hope we shall not be deceived in this event. The cool. ners, energy, and manly tact of Northumbrians have borne them successfuUy through many a straggle, and these qualities will not faill them now." The folloving advertisement Is published iu the papers this morning:- "NoIrTnu-NmritLAnD ASD DusiAm Dmreor BAN.? " In order to meet the commercial requirements of this town and nelghbourhoDd, consequent UpOR the suspension of the above establih. ment, arrangements are now being made by some of its shsreholders for the formation of a private bank, whioh will be announced wIthout delay. '" Newcastle-on'Tjyne, Nov. 25. The fact that Barclay and Co., the London arents of the District Bank, had refused payment of Its draughts, was known In Newcastle last night, and the closing of Its doors was not quite unexpected this morning In commercial circles. The other banks in the neighbonrhood were less taken by sur. prise, aud were more prepared to meet the storm that has broken over our heads by the knowledge of this circumstance. The prospects of the working classes In the district are very gloomy for the winter, as thousands of them must be irumediately paid off. THE NEWCASTLE BANKS, (BY ELECTRIC AND IN'TRNATIONAL TELEGRAPH.) NEWCASTLE, TZauSIAY NIGHT. Bank hours are over to-day without any absolute run upon either the Union or Lambton's banks in this tows4, or upon the branches of the Union or the National Provinclal Bank In Shields or Sunderland. Though every ono appears stupefied by the stoppage of the District Bank this morning, there is no panic. The other banks are considered to be quite safe. The stoppage of the District Bank Is likely to prove the worst calamity that has beenx known in this distriet. The absolute loss, it is conjectured by well-itformed persons, will exceed 1,000,0001 The directors and leading shareholders have been sltting with closed doors all day. Nothing has transpired. The meeting of shareholders takes place in a day or two. The Branch Bank of England in this town undertakes to assist Carr, Palmer, Jautt, Bowes and Co., Marley.hill Collieries, Nicholas Wood, Black Boy Colleries, and other coalowners and large manufacturers doing buslness with the District Bank, so that some thousands of workmen will be paid their wages on Saturday, and they will remain employed. Mr. Hodgson, from the Bank of England, is coming down to see what can be done to relieve trade.

FATAL ST-EAUSHIP COLLTSION OFF ERITH.-Yesterday Mr. W. Baker held a long inquiry at the Town of Ramegate, Wapping, on the body of George Granger, a seaman on board tte collier brig Welthen, of Whitby, who, with another of the crew, was drowned by their vessel being run Into off Ejith by the European and American Steam Company's powerful steamship Argo. Mr. Charnock, the barrister, appeared for Captain Benson, the commander of the Barrow, barrlster, for the pUot; and Mr. Waites for the relatives of the deceased. A vast bodly of evidence was taken, but the following are the main facts:On the afternoon of the 7th inst. the Welthen was off Erith driftlng up the river with the tide; there was no wind, and she even had not helm command. The Argo, a powerful ship of upwards of 2,000 tons burden, was observed coming down the river right in the direction of the brig. The crew of the latter hailed her, but it was said that no notice was taken of their cries, and five of the hands, seeing that a col. lision rwas inevitable, got into a boat which was hanging at the stern. The steamer struck the brig on the port side and carried away the main rigglng, quarter, and stern, and then passed over the boat, the painter of which the men had been unable to get clear, and drowned two of the poor fellows. The survivors were pliked up by a Coastguard boatman at Erith. It was averred that had there been a proper look-out on board the steamer, and had she been navigated more in midchannel, the collision would not have ha pened. For the steamer it was stated that there ad been a proper look-out, that she was navigated with all care and attention, and that the collision arose from a strong current of the tide acting upon the s teamer's bow and running her head off towards the brig. The jury, after some delberation, returned a verdict of accidental death, "but they could not separate without declaring a strong sense of the want of sficient look-out, care, and attention on the part of the person in charge and management of the steamer before and after the accident took place." They also expressed their commendation of the conduct of the Coastguard boatmnan in saviim life oii the occasdon. The other body has since been p10ckea up at Erith,

LONDON, FBIDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1857. Never was there a contest in which the victors owed so little to what is called " luck" as that which seems now to be drawing to a close in India. Everywhere the governing race was surprised, outwitted, and reduced to the most terrible straits. Everywhere fortune seemed to go against them,-the fortune of position, of opportunity, and of season. The largest cities, in which were concentrated the strongest forces of Sepoys, fell into the hands of the enemy; Delhi, Agra, Lucknow, and Cawnpore seemed irretrievably lost. The time was one when the British force in India was unprecedentedly small, since within a few years kingdom after kingdom had been annexed without any corresponding increase of European troops. Then the mutiny broke out in the early summer, when the natives of a temnperate climate are least able to bear exertion, and a long march or a hard day's fighting may be expected to lay up nearly every man in hospital. Our countrymen seem, in fact, to have been placed by fortune under every possible disadvantage, and to have plucked safety and victory out of danger only by the exercise of the highest faculties necessary to war. Perhaps the most surprising fact connected with this great history is that success has been won -without the slightest aid from home. When Delhi was stormed, and the Residency at Lucknow relieved, more than 40,000 men were tossing on the ocean, but not one had reached the scene of war. In every kind of steam or sailing vessel which could be adapted to the conveyance of troops, the forces of England had been shipped off batch by batch during tbree long months, but even the swiftest sailer had hardly arrived in the Hooghly before the fate of the war had been decided. Now, though we have in this case happily fallen on our feet, and though the British name will even receive a higher lustre from the scantiness of the numbers who have won the battle, yet it is not unimportant to point out the fault that has been committed in sending reinforcements by such Blow and antiquated machines as the ordinary class of sailing ships. By the last mail we have intelligence that a number of vessels containing about 5,000 men had arrived at various ports of our Indian possessions up to the 22d of Octo ber. It is to the difference in the length of these passages that we would call attention. It may, however, be remarked that all the sailing vessels have made passages far more tedious than the average, and that winds and waves seem also to have been in a conspiracy with our enemies. We even hear of calms on the Line lasting for nearly four weeks. There had arrived, however, at Calcutta 'when the mail left the steamships Thebes, Golden Fleece, and Caledonian. The Thebes sailed July 31, the Golden Fleece August 8, the Caledonian July 26. Thus all these steamers had accomplished the voyage under three months, and the Golden Fleece, one of the largest and finest vessels afloat, had arrived in about two months and a half. The mail steamer passed the ships Areta and Bucephalus, the former of which left England as early as the 18th of June, while the other sailed on the 1st of July. Thus the Golden Fleece, which sailed more than seven zweeks after the Areta, arrived at Calcutta beforo her, beating the Bucephalus also by more than five weeks. Now, the event has been fortunate, but if it had been otherwise what would the world have thought of an arrangement which produced so intolerable a delay? Seven weeks I What might not have been done in that time ? The mines under Lucknow might have been finished, and HAvELocxmight have come too late for the rescue ; the Punjab or the Bombay Presidency nmight have broken into revolt through a belief that the English succours that were so long talked about had no existence. In fact, the whole fortune of the war, and perhaps the destiny of India, might have been changed by the negkct to use the most familiar application of science at the clitical hour. At Madras were the Carthage and United Kingdom steamers, the former of which left England on the 1st of August, and the latter on the 4th of the same month. At the latest dates no sailing vessel had reached Madras. At Galle there had arrived on the 23d of Oetober the steamship Australian, which left England on the 15th of August, and had therefore made the passage in 69 days; on the 25th the Candia arrived In 71 days, while only two or three sailing vessels from among those earliest despatched had made their appearance. On the whole, it may be said that the average difference between the passages of the sailing vessels and the steamers will probably be found considerably to exceed a month. Of course, in this estimate we do not include large clippers like the Lightning and the James Baines, which were taken up at a later period, but only the ordinary sailing craft in which the troops were despatched during June and the early part of July. Now, there can be no doubt that the whole of the troops might have been sent in stcamers without any sacrifice to the country. The great impulse which the building of screw steamers had received would have enabled the Government at any time to command the services of a dozen or more first-class vessels. The owners are always wiUing to lend if the Government will hire. Nor can we believe that the additional expense ought to weigh for a moment in the choice. In fact, it is doubtful if steam transport is not in reality cheaper than by the ordinary sailing vessels. The passage is shorter, and the ship may be returned to its owners within a less time. The loss of the soldier's services by a long voyage must also be taken into account, and the chance of sickness induced by protracted confinement on board. Viewed even as a matter of money, we may say that the prompt arrival of troops is necessarily the first consideration. But here the emergency was most pressing, and yet in defiance of remonstrance troops were sent in ships which have lost seven weeks on the voyage. If we are rightly informed, the QUBEN'S Government has not been primarily to biame in this affair. The East India Directors have been the partisans of that method of marine locomotion which beat accords with their antique traditions. In fact, the first batch of troops was sent out upon the requisition of the Company, the Government being only concerned so far that it furnished the men. A certain number of troops were made over to the Company, which transported them in its own manner. It was only when the danger became extreme that the Directors were prevailed upon to take up the best vessels and to send out the men with the utmost despatch. Of course, the reasoning of the Dircctors and their partisans has been that India belongs to the Company, and that all which the Government should do in to supply at a fair remuneration men todefendit. But the country can no longer submit to such fictions. The double Government, which is the type of obstruction aud, circumlocution, has had its day, and must now give way to something better suited to the present time and to actual -wants. We are happy to say that as soon as Parliament meets for the despatch of general business the total abolition of. the Company's Government will be proposed by Ministers. India will be brought immediately under the control of the Cxowx and Parliament, with such a machinery of administration as shall te thought conducive to its welfare. The greatest dependency of the enrpire will receive the benefits cf direct Parliamentary supervision and direct Ministerial responsibility. TInder such a system wue cannot doubt that the nation which has conquered and reconquered India will soon urge it onward with new force in the path of improvement.
There are few more universal or more legitimate feelings in the English mind than a contemptuous antipathy to the King of NAMLES. Most of us would privately rejoice in a legitimate opportunity for punishing wrongs and cruelties, which are not the less irritating because we have hitherto been unable to find any plausible pretext for making the quarrel our own. When some hairbrained conspirators lately landed on the Neapolitan coast from a Sardinian steamer which they had forcibly seized, the tidings that two English engineers were imprisoned as belonging to the crew of the vessel were received with a k;nd of satisfaction. It was cercain that in that happy region justice would be delayed; it was highly probable that it would be ultimately perverted, nor could there be any doubt that Neapolitan officials would rejoice in the opportunity of persecuting English subjects, asif theywerecountrymen of their own. Out of this state oF circumstances it was not impossible that a ground might be laid for a forcible interference; but those who are already demanding the intervention of Lord LyoN-s to cut the knot have not sufficiently considered whether there has been a violation of international right. It seemed at least probable that the Neapolitan Government would endeavour to keep within the strict letter of the law. An act of violence on the part of England would perhaps not be altogether unwelcome ; but the IKTNG and his advisers must know that against a legal exercise of superior force no European Power would aid them, even by an expression of sympathy. Lord PALAMERSTON'S famous boast of the CYirs I?orntanus has greatly added to his popularity; but if he had been one of the eminently cautious class of Ministers he would have foreseen that the phrase 'was likely often to bring bim into trouble. The alltusion, although sufficiently appropriate for rhetorical purposes, was not literally accurate. The Roman recognized no world beyond that in which he was everywhere at home. Even the proscribed fugitive on the Inhospitable shores of Pontus felt himuself a prisoner, and not an exile. In the instance of the appeal to the dignity of the Inperial franchise which is most p pularly known ST. ?AiL was resisting the violence of a Roman soldier in a provincial garrison. The British Empire offers at least equal security to its subjects over a larger portion of the earth's surface, but it has nevertheless limits and recognized equals. Even the Roman citizern would haTe claimeed immnunity in vain if he had wandered into the dominions of PHRAATEs or taken service under AmNirus. The law of nations, a code of entirely modern growth, takes the place of municipal right for all residents in a foreign land. The Civis Romanus has, in truth, no privileges in strange countries except those which equally attach to the citizen of San Marino or to the subject of Modena. Lord PAL srsTow probably meant to assert that the power of England would be put forward to vindicate, wherever Englishmer were concerned, a strict observance of the law of nations. He must blame his own eloquence if he is sometimes expectod to guarantee to his countrymen an exceptional position in all parts of the world. The nation which of all others is most prone to wander abroad in search of fortune ought to comprehend the impossibility that every adventurer should carry about his person the securities of the English constitution. By the comity of nations Ambassadors are entitled to consider their Residencies as a part of their native country; but it would be quite impracticable to confer on Leicester-square the police, the octroi, and the other privileges to whieh its denizens are accustomed at home. On the other hand, an English artisan in a foreign country must submit to the laws to which he voluntarily makes himself amenable. If he has coloured blood in his veins he must bear with exclusiveness in America. In Italy, even if the sbirro fails to mark him for his peculiar prey, he will have to share the disabilities and oppressions which are familiar to the subjects of a despotism. There is every reason to believe that the engineers of the Cagliari, as well as their foreign shipmates, were entirely innocent. The conspirators, it is said, threatened them with instant death if they refused to work the engines; and insurgents, with their lives in their hands, are of aU others the moat lkely to carry out a similar threat. Neverthleless, it is absurd to deny that the Neapolitan authorities were in the first instance justified ir arresting the ship's company. The burden of proving their innocence lay on the sailors who were found in immediate co-operation with the would-be invaders. All the prisoners, whether natives or foreigners, were equally liable to detention until they bhould be discharged in due course of law. It was an unfortunate incident in their condition that they were in the interval necessarily subject to the abominable system which prevails inNeapolitan prisons of detention. But until some exceptional or obviously illegal act of severity was inflicted on the English prisoners the Government could have no actual right of remonstrance; and auy appeal to the couxtesy or good feeling of the authorities would, of course, be thrown away. It is not necessary to protest against the contingency of atrocious acts, such as the examination by torture, which is so common in the prisons of Naples. These cruelties are direct violations even of Neapolitan law; and if they were inflicted on an English subject redress might be demanded at the caunon's mouth for so demonstrable and manifest a wrong. The law of nations secures to a foreigner the same measure of justice which is under the municipal law awarded to a native. The " citizen of "I llome" may appeal to the Senate and the People when he has suffered wrong ; but it is no injustice that he should be dealt with according to the laws of the country where he has voluntarily taken up his abode. If, as in the present singular case, he avers that he entered the country under compulsion, the local courts can alone try the validity of his plea. No further privilege can be reasonably claimed in dealing with any civilized State. The Turks, indeed, have recognized the wide difference of their institutions by allowing English functionaries to administer exclusive jurisdiction over their countrymen; but the law of Naples is almost identical with that of France, affording, as it claims to have presumed, sufficient security to those who place themselves within reach of its operation. The only points in the law of nations which can arise in the present dispute turn entirely on the terms of the Neapolitan Code, and on the fairness with which it may be administered. There is no doubt that in several respects the imprisoned engineers have been exposed to harsh, if not to illegal treatment. It seems that the authorities have withheld the permission ordinarily granted to prisoners of receiving visits in the interval between the completion of the preliminary examination and the actual trial. The Assistant-Consul, acting under the immediate direction of the Foreign-office, has been refused an interview with the prisoners; and the opportunity of offering a discourtesy to the English Government has doubtless causcd much enjoyment at Caserta. The trial itself is vexatiously postponed; and it seems that in the opinion of Neapolitan lawyers certain provisions of the law have been actually violated. The strong language used at Newcastle by the townsmen of one of the sufferers is creditable to their feelings, but a Foreign Minister is not at liberty to be guided by mere sympathy, nor can he act on any but authenticated statements. It can scarcely be true that prisoners detained for trial have been subjected to the penal infliction known as the carcere duro. Such an act on the part of the Neapolitan authorities would relieve the English Government from many necessary though unpopular scruples. It is bad enough that our countrymen should be, under any circumstances, subjected to the power of the vile oppressors and satellites who have willingly obeyed the command of their master in torturing for years the best and noblest of his subjects; but any act of demonstrated cruelty exceeding the licence allowed by the law would legitimately call down vengeance, which might in its consequences extend beyond the redress of the imme-diate wrong.
Telegraphic cornmunications from India are affected in their details by an obscurity which is neither unnatural nor surprising. The nomenclature of Indian topography is embarrassing enough at the best, but the difficulties it creates are doubled by the fact that no uniform rule of spelling has ever been adopted. Every writer follows his own conceptions in adapting the British vernacular to the Asiatic alphabets, and the difference in the results is occasionally so great that w7ords of a dozen letters miay be found expressed ia forms which have only two letters in common. To the perplexities thus produced must be added that arising from the constant repetitions of the same names all over the country, and even within the same province. Thus, there are at least three Futtehpores within easy d3istance of Cawnpore, and there are two Hyderabads-each a capital of an importa,nt cTstrict-besides others of less renown. Circumstances like theEe are, of course, calculated to cause confusion in raessages transmitted through a chain of telegraphic lines, but, though some minor particulars are left uncertain on the present occasion, the broad facts of the intelligence conveyed are happily too plain to be mistaken. It no longer adimits of a doubt that our arms are triumphant at all points, that reinforcements have already arrived in strength amply sufflcient to preserve the ascendancy acqluired, and tltat the general condition of Indian affairs is encouraging in the extreme. The information now brought vill be most readily simplified by observing in succession the principal movements of the mutineers. It seems as if we may now almost dismiss from our consideration that main body of insurgents which but recently reprersented the strength of the rebellion. The garrison of Delhi, as an organized military force, appears pretty well accounted for. Over and above the losses sustained during the siege and the six days' conflict which attended the storm aud capture of the city, they have since been three times brought to action, and defeated on each occasion with great slaughter. They were first overtaken by General GREATHED at Bolundshuhur, then again by the same energetic commander at Allyghur, and, finaly, they were surprised at Seorajpore, in the immediate vicinity of Bithoor, being still 3,000 or 4,000 strong, by a smaU column from Cawnpore, and utterly routed. That parties of the Delhi force may stiU be keeping the field is probable enough, and we learn, indeed, that Brigadier SHOWxnS is on the heels of Bome of them; but it is not in reason to suppose that they can retain much spirit or cohesion after such repeated disasters. A second, and by no means inconsiderable body of revolters, was formed by the mutinous Contingents of SCINDT.Ai at Gwalior and of HOLXAn at Indore. According to the accounts of the last mail the Indore troops had taken post at Dholpore, while the Gwalior men had been " dispersed" by the active and serviceable intervention of SciNDrAH. We are now told, however, that the troops which composed the latter force are still in the field, and that they are marching upon Cawnpore by way of Jhansi. As Jhansi is nearly due south of Gwalior, and Cawnpore nearly due East, this would represent a very circuitous course, but it is possible that the mutineers had been driven to some distance from Gwalior by SCrNDiA's more faithful levies, and we observed last week that they were by no means unlikely, even after their reported dispersion, to preserve organization sufficient to bring them on the scene again. It is added that a Maharajah-with a title not at present aseertainable-has been murdered by his own people, which may possibly point to some unexpected success obtained by these double traitors to the supreme Government of India and their own imumed;ate Prince. ScINDrAH's position, however, by the previous accounts was so strong that we may reasonably hope no such fate has attended his exemplary loyalty, while we are not without a belief that the rebels in question have already received signal chastisement. The third of General GBEATHrE's victories-that at Agra-was obtained over a body of mutineers obviously distinct from those previously routed at Bolundshuhur and Allyghur, and it is most probable that they represented either the main force or a considerable division of the Mahratta Contingents. This series of victories would thus have disposed of the principal rebel forces, with the exception of the insurgents in Oude. In that province it is evident that the revolters, notwithstanding their repeated losses, are still mustering in great strength, though they appear to have contracted the circle of their operations, and to have drawn together in the vicinity of Luckno r. Until the recent successes of rAvrLocx and OurTiA3r every step of the 50 miles between Cawnpore and the last-mentioned capital was contested by masses of mutineers, but we now learn that the communication from Cawnpore is open up to a place, of which the orthography is not yet very distinct, within four miles of Liucknow, and at this spot Sir JAnES OUTBASI has recommended the establishment and organization of a strong force. Of the safety of the heroic garrison of Lucknow we may now, we rejoice to think, feel confidently assured. Though the enemy still occupied the district in cons!derable strength they had clearly been driven to adopt a defensive instead of an aggressive attitude, for we are told that they were intrenching themselves, and we hear of no attacks upon our own positions. Moreover, a convoy of provisions had safely arrived, though escorted by only 250 men, and, what should be decisive of the question, UIIvELocx was in command and GREATnnD close at hand. Under HAvxLoc: alone were 3,000 British soldiers; GREATHEDi within six days of the date of the despatch would bring up 4,000 more, and the combined force under two such Generals would be sufficient to sweep the country from end to end. Irrespectively, however, of these gratifying conclusions, the whole tenour of the present despatchcs is calculated to inspire us with the utmost satisfaction at the progress of affairs. Our arms are successful in every direction ; every Commander, -whether WmsoX or E[AvELoci, or OUTRAx or GBEATUED, does his work to a marvel; every division of troops marches with an alacrity and decision which would be admirable even on home L service; and though the scene of action is Rindostan, where it used to be thought that Europeans were crippled by the exigencies of the climate, our columns seem to move without even the ordinary impediments of war. We hear of no commissariat difficulties, no " requisitions," no embarrassments of system, no complications of ioutine, such as our Crimean experience made us Eo sadlv familiar with. The work is incessant, and the numbers are small, but everything is done promptly, dexterously, and triumphantly. It is only natural, though it is a highly important consequence of these successes, that the suspended functions of the Indian administration, and especially the collection of its dues, should now be brought again into action. The revenue, we are told, was coming in "very rapidly," and loyalty, notwithstanding a continuance of small local defections, " was the order of the day." The restoration of confidence in our supremacy, which caunot now be long delayed, and which will probably be attended with more implicit faith on the part of the population than prevailed even before, wiU have the effect of drawing hoards of specie from their concealment, and greatly facilitating any loans which the Government may desire to contract. Though India is not, in the modern sense of the term, an opulent country, there is abundance of capital in native hands, and prudence will suggest to so inteUllgent a people that these accumula- tions will be safer in the custody of an invincible Government than in dwellings which may still for some time be at the mercyof any marauding gang. The work of occupation, indeed, and of pacification, complete enough to re-establish universal security, may probably yet consume much time and engage even otrrapidly increasing forces; but this monstrous mautiny has now been fairly crushed-and crushed, let it never be forgotten, by the yet unaided resources of India and the adjacent colonies.
We cannot wonder at the mythical histories of the dark ages when we read the reports which circulate in this age of activity and instruction. The eleven thousand virgins of Cologne and the Theban Legion of ST. MauxricE are narratives far exceeded in richness of invention by some which the continental press are putting forth regarding the levies supposed to be made in France and Gelmany for the British service in India. A follower of NIEBBuR or GROTE might advan- tageously exercise his faculties in tracing to its origin such an elaborate fiction as that which the cozrrier du Bas RILin has just given to the world. Not among the Faits divers, not with the vague heading, On ecrt de L)2dres, but distinctly and of its owyn authority, the Strasburg print gives us the following circumstantial intelligence:-" The English Government has resolved " to raise a foreign legion for the East " Indies. One of the principal recruiting offices " is to be established at Strasburg on the 1st of " December, under the orders of Colonel HUDSON, " assisted by Major CAFE, Capbain WmxntsoN " (Paymaster), &c." Such has been the effect of this and some similar announcements that applications have been made both in Marseilles and Paris by Frenchmen who were willing to join in the enterprise of reconquering India for the English. If the paragraph was meant as a hoax it has been perfectly successful; if it was made sincerely and with a belief in its trtth, it only shows with how little of political knowledge, with how little of common intelligence, a continental journal may be conducted. Even the IndependaneeBelae, which passes for being well-informed, and is the chief organ of publicity in a European capital, has joined in propagating the absurd delusion, and, with an amusing affectation of precision, explains that recruits are at the present time regularly forwarded to London, instead of being sent to India direct by Marseilles, as some other equally veracious journal had represented. Not for the satisfaction of our own countrymen, but to prevent any of the continental youth from wasting their time and labour, we may at once declare that the whole story about the raising of a foreign legion for India is devoid of foundation. There is not, and there never has been, any intention of asking the assistance of foreigners in the struggle. India has been conquered by English soldiers, and recent events have proved that it can be retained by the same means. When this country can no longer rely on its owvn children for the defence of its possessions it will be time to cut the links which bind each dependency to us, and once more to stand alone, as in the days of the PLANTAGENFTS. We would not, however, be Supposed to speak with any scorn of the assistarce of such foreign levies as have served under our flag in former wars. England is a country where ever accumulating wealth and ever increasing commerce make labour dear, and implant in the minds of the people an ambition to rise by industrial pursuits. The army is supplied wholly by volunteers, and the State can only count on those whom a natural spirit of enterprise urges to take service. Military life also is with lis very different from what it is in continental countries. The British soldier, instead of spending his whole term of service in some inland garrison, Is hurried off from his native soil to regions where he has to uudergo every privation, every extreme of heat and cold, and to combat every kind of cruel and perfidious enemy. HIe is to-day on the Caffre frontier of South Africa, to-morrow he may be ordered to Rangoon, where the Burmese may be sending firerafts down the river, to Hongkong, where the Chinese may have slaughtered a brig's crew, to New Zealand, where some successor of Huin [may defy us from his Pah. The news that an Indian Emperor had been enthroned at Delhi, and 100,000 men were in arms against the Government, differed only by its magnitude from what our English soldiers may any day be prepared to hear. It follows, therefore, that with a prosperous country, requiring continvous supplies of labour, with a voluntary enlistment, and a most hazardous and wearing service, England may at some conjunctures find herself short of men. This may happen -when she is suddenly engaged in a great European war. In such cases our countrymen have been ready to accept the services of brave men whose countries have been in alliance with us, and whose instincts prompted them to fight against the same enemywith whom we were at war. Thus in the great contest against NAPoLEOx we had Brunswickers and Portuguese and Sicilians raised by the British Government, and fighting under the command of British Generals. In the late war against Russia we had German, Swiss, Italian, and Polish Legions, all composed of volunteers and officered by their own countrymen. Only the conclusion of the war prevented these troops being brought into active service and showing what their spirit and discipline could accomplish. Besides these, there were 20,000 men of the Turkish Contingeut, conspicuous among the coinmanders of which was that General NRILL who has just ended his honourable career. But one principle has governed all these levies of foreign troops. They have been engaged for European war, to fight as we considered in the general interest of Europe, and in obedience to feelings which they shared in common with ourselves. The legions raised in 1854 were not merely mercenaries. They were made up of the subjects of States actually at war with the CZAR, of fugitives from provinces which he had conquered, and which still desired their independence, or of men whose patriotic feelings impelled them, in spite of the neutrality of their Sovereigns, to take up arms against the Power which threatened Europe. Very different would be any enlistment for Indian service. The British people would never offer such proposals as these French and Belgian newspapers have invented. In this servile war we are quite strong enough to manage our own affairs, nor if we conceived the notion of importincg foreign soldiers into India would history give usmuch encouragement. SURAJrM DowLA and TipPoo SAIB in former days and RUNJEET SINton in ours tried the experiment, and there is little to encourage us in the example. This country can fight its own battles in Its own possessions, and if it has ever caUled for foreign aid it has been as a supplement, and not as a substitute, to native arms and courage.

AAMERIcA.. (BY ELEUElIC AND N T.LEGRA,L ) SODT1AMPFTON, FRIDAY MOileoa. The lUnited States' steamer Aragoo Captain lAnes, has arrived off Cowez with New Vfnrk advice to the 14th inst. The Arabia, from Liverpool, arrived out on the 13th. A despatch from Washington of the 13th announces that despatches had that day been received by the State Department from Chief Justice Echols, of Utah, dated at " Camp on Sweet Vi ater, 21 mlleg east of South Pass, October the 13th, 1857." Judge Echols says,- "An express has just arrived from Green River, and reports that on the night of the 5th of October a train ot 26 waggons was captured bY the Mormons 25 miles from the Pacific spring. At the same time two other trains were taken near Green River, in all 78 waggons and loading. The Mormons said they had700 men there,and 1,500 more at SaltLake City. Colonel Alexander is encamped at Hams Fort, 30 miles in advance of the front train which is destroyed. He sent Captain Marcy with 400 men back to Green River, to enable the teamsters to coUect their cattle. The Mormone kiUed no one, for the reason that no resistance was made. Colonel Smith vdll collect the trains on this side, and escort them forward. One train is now before us and two behind. We are iu good sp'irts, and that is a great help to all. The Mormons wiU likely at. tack us in a day or two, and may rue their impu. deuce. We have 47 men in this command, bnt Colonel Smith is a host within himself. We have deter, mined, if attacked, to use the rifles in the lines. We shall most likely take the route on Bear River for Salt Lake City. The want of forage for our mules is the greatest hindrance, but we wil go on if we have to walk and carry our provisions." The above despatch, showing the first overt act of the Mormon treason, was immediately laid before the President of the United States, who summoned the membern of the Cabinet for consultation ipon its contentn. The intelligence was considered in Cabinetmeeting in the afternoon, but no definite action was determined on. The Secretary of War thinks it would be hopeless to send reinforcements or supplies so late in the season as this. Despatches are anxiously looked for from Colonel Johnson, who is in command of the army for Utah. The Government officers do not fully credit the report received from Judge Echols. Financial matters at lNew York atim showed sym. ptoms of progressive improverment. The Herald of the 14th, in it5 review of the previous day's money-market, says,- "The arrival of the steamship Arabia at this port from Liverpool, with seven days' later advices, at an early honr this morning gave quite an impetus to the stosk-market, The movement was unusnally active, and in almost every instance an important improvement was realized, The bulls appear to be in fine feather jist now, but we fear they will not realize much of the advance In market value. Small holders of stocks outside the streets may take advan. tage of their inflation and sell their suppUes, but the large holders in the streets cannot do this. They being the regulators of the market must hold on and buy more to sustain prices, and in this way they are likely to get fiPled up with stocks a" high prices. At preu:nt, however, thing^ look bright for the bulls, and they operate vith a great deal of spirit.

All the Western Railroad stocks were in demand to-day at the im. provement In market value, and the aggregate opera. tlons were equal to almost any day during the prevalence of a speculative excitement In the street, The great difficulty is the absence of outsiders. The ' bulls of the Stock-Exchange have the entiro load to carry, and prices have become so inflated that the burden is already oppressive. Notwithstanding the abundance of money, at the second Board a further advance was realized, and the market closed firm at our quotations.

There w;as considerable arti. vlty this afternoon in railroad siecks, and the operations on time comprDse but a very few lots. It is a most extraordinary feature of the market that so large a portion of the transactions is for cash. This shows great abundance of money, and it also shows that very few outsiders are among the operators. "The notes of the Manufacturers' Bank at Manchester, Connecticut, were thrown out to-day by the Metropolitan Bank." The working men's demonstrations at New York were dwindling away to nothing, and the majority of those assembled seemed to attend merely for the purpose of enjoying the fun created by the eccentricities of Madame Ranke. The Collins steamship Adriatic went to sea on the 13th on a trial trip. A gentleman who was on board of her 12 hours reports her performance as exceedingly satisfactory. She was positively to leave for Liverpool on the 21st inst, The steamer Isabel had arrived at Charleston with advices from Havannah to the 10th, but they contained no news of iaterest. Emphatic instructions had been sent south from Washington, with a view, if possible, to intercept General AValker and his party. The Navy Department expresses a confidence that the Filibusters will be intercepted. Accounts from Kansas state that Messrs. Moore, Calhoun, and others propose to submit to the people of the territory a sort of double-headed constitution, one with and one without slavery. Other accounts state that the Pro-Slavery clause, which received only four dissentient votes, would alone be submitted for ratification, so that no chance would be given to reject the constitution. It was expected the Convention would adjourn on the 7th inst. The news received by the Arabia had the effe^t of checking sales of cotton; the light stock, however, induced holders not to press sales, and in one case for a respectable time a buyer offered to take it at a half cent decline, which was refused; the moderate receipts and light stock of breadstuffs also tended to prevent a decline to correspond with a depression of prices in LiverpooL Flour, with moderate sales, closed at a decline of about 5c. to 10c. per barrel, and common and mcdium grades of wheat also fell off 2c. to 3c. per bushel, while prime was scarce and [sales limited.

TIIE INDIAN MUTINIES. _- THE CAPTURE OF DELHI. Tie toltowing letter is from an officer in the Glst who commanded the party wvhich took the Palace, and afterwards had the custody of the old King. It shows what spirit animated every soldier engaged In the siege, and what atrocities were committed by the enemy even during the final struggle, justifying every act of our soldiery which otherwise might have had the look of cruelty:- " Ajmere Gate, Delhi, Sept. 26. "My dear Father,-I confess I have been somewhat remiss in my correspondence of late, but until the last two or three days I have been so knocked about that I have, In truth, hardly had a moment to myself. At last, after having been hard at it for nearly four months, wo have taken this accursed place. I must try and give you a sketch of our operations. The wing to which I belonged lef t Ferozepore on the 25th of July, and arrived here on the 14th of Augast. You may fancy how hot it was in tents-the wonder was we didn't all die from it. We made forced marches so as to join the army as quickly as possible. Until the arrival of our siege train of hcavy guns and mortars we could do nothing beyond keeping up a cannonade from such guns as we had in battery, to which the enemy replied, flowever on the 7th inst. the long looked-for train arrived in camp and we at once commenced the offensive by throwing up our first battery on the right, at a distance of some 400 yards from the Moree bastion. A line of batteries was gradually established by night from the right battery towards our left, and by the 10th were all in fuD play, keeping up a terrific cannonade, to which, however, the enemy replied withvigour. However, such was the fire concentrated on the Cashmere bastion that the guns on it were smashed to atoms and the enemy unable to reply. One of the most unpleasant nights I ever passed was on the 9th, when I commanded a working party throwing up a sandbag battery, about 280 yards from the Cashmere and Church batteries of the enemy. The blaguards kept us constantly on the cjui vive with a fire of shels, round shot, and grape, and as we were in an open plain or field, and the guns so close, we were at times obliged to discontinue work and lie flat on our faces and no let the grape pass over us; the darkness favoured us very much, but a party of our regiment who relieved us at daybreak on the 10th, were driven from the place, losing five men. On the 13th it was pretty we]l known in camp that we were to assault the city on the following morning, and we were all anxiety, wonderng how it was to be done. True enough, at 2 in the morning of the 14th we paraded, and at 3 mnarched down to the assault. There were two breaches, and we went at the left one between the Cashmere and Water bastions; the ditch was about 30 feet deep and 50 bread. As we neared the walls we caught it from grape, rockets, and musketry, the air being literally alivo with bullets of all sizes. On we rushed arnd quickly descended the ditch, and, rearing our scaling ladders against the scsrp of the wall, away we went. We soon forced an entrance into the place, and then a most terrible strugglo ensued. We had to charge up narrow streets and lanes swept by guns firing double charges of grape. And here it was our losses for the most part occurred. I may as well at once say I hear about 65 officers and 1,200 mnen were put hors de combat. I have been in a good deal of rough and terrible work myself, but I was never in my liFe under such a fire of grape as these rascals kept up. We fought tiUl dark, some 15 hours, and by that time had reached the Cabul gate. From the 15th to the 19th we were at it every day, On the 16th our regi. ment stormed the magazine, and on the 20th I commanded the storming party which took the Ring's Palace. We dilled about 235 inside, and somue escaped over the waDs and across the river. The gate bsing closed the engineer atta^-hed a bag of powder to it, and on its exploding we rushed in, polishing off every Sepoy we met. In a quarter of an hour we had possession of the place. In the meantime another party went and took the fort of Selimghur, and the same night pickets were pushed forward in all directions, and by midnight the whole city was in our posseasion. Thus, at last, with the help of the Almighty, we have takea this blaguard place, where so many fearful deeds were committed. The King has been caught, and his two sons slain; also his grandson, Aboo Bakkur. Their bodies, nalked and full of bullet holes, were cast in the Chandnl Chouk (the swell Regent-street of Delhi) before the police-station, and were visited by hundreds' myself included. Two of these accursed princes vie' lated our women, and then had them cut up in pleces. They m, r1l be bound, in a warmer place than India just now, and one too where punkas and tatties are not available. I was on guard over the King and his-wives and coenoubies on the 24th and 25th, and was obllged to be much on the alert to prevent rescue or attempts at escape. I was ordered to shoot him if things came to the last extremity. Yesterday I handed him over to a guard of 60th Rflies, being precious ga to be relieved of so responsiDle a position. We daUy find hidden 3n the houses Sepoys who were unable to escape from slokness or woumds; these are all put to death on the spot; on the 24th I caught a fine tal sowar or troper of o-me light cavalry regiment, dragged him out into tie Ftreet and shot him dead. No mercy can be shown to them. Wo don't forget, and won't forget, the masacres of women and children, and we i,ll every Sepoy we catch. The city is quite deserted, and all the citizens have fled. It Is curious to tee a large place llke this without a soul In it. We have plundered al the shops and aU the valnables are being collected and sold for prize. Our vengeance Cannot be appeased, for we found several of our men who had been merely wounded on the 14th in the assault, and overlooked by us, lying dead minus their heads, and fearx fully gashed with sabre cuts; and so we spare no one. Every Sepoy we catch, ' Shoot him' is the word. I'm sorry to say our regiment has suffered much, and we have buried four officers and upwards of 200 men since it left Ferozepore. Our less from the 14th to the 20th of September was four officers wounded and 81 men killed and wounded, out of less than 350-a pretty good test of the fire we were under, our loss being one-fourth. There are aso seven or eight men missing, and who, I believe, we must put down as slain. We have buried aboutl20 from cholera; and now the whole regiment nmnsters about 550, of whom some 200 are In hos. pital, sick and wounded and convalescent-a nice cutting up, Indeed ! As for me, I have, by God's blessing, preserved my health and spirits wonderfully well, taking into consideration the heat and hardships to which I have been exposed. How truly fortunate I have been again to escape death In this campaign up to the present moment, and how grateful we ought all to be to a merciful Providence for having thus shielded me from EU harm ! A force8th and 75th Foot, 9th Lancers, and 2d Punjab Corps, and 18 light guns, have gone to Allyghur to pursue theflyingSepoqs. Nonewsof ourrelnforcements. When 11 is over the English regiments will, I suppose, make their appearance. The country is still in a fearful state, and Onde and Rohilcund will have to be overruun with troop5 before we can hope to tranquilize it. I bolieve we shall remain here for the present at least, and I am in great hopes we shall be sent back to our old quarters to rest our weary bones for a while." The following are extracts from the letters of an olficer at Delhi:- "Camp, Delhi, Sept. 13. "I was 24 hours on duty in the trenches behind Brind's Battery. It was an extraordinary sight. The enemy came out twice to attack us the night I was there. No one can have an idea of such a scene but one who has been under fire. The roar of cannon, the whistling of buUets, grape, &c., overhead Is at first uncomfortable, but you soon get accustomed to this. The coohless of English soldiers is certainly extraordinary; they regard tho whizz of a cannon. ball as little as a schoolboy does a snowball. Poor fellows, they have had very hard work since the 9th; day and night they have been engaged, yet you never hear them grumble, except when the grog is delayed. The days are very warm, yet the excitement keeps them up, and few have been admitted with coup de soleil. " It is a curious tbing -what a temperate man can undergo in this country. I have been exposed to the sun at all hours, and in the trenches the whole 12, without any covering; yet I never felt any bad offects. We all take quinine as a preventive of fever, and certainly those who take it regularly escape the attack, or merely have It of an ephemeral type. We had a great loss yesterday in Captain Fagan, of the Artillery, killed In the batteries by a musket-shot through the head. Poor man, he had been more under fire than any other man, and has been always on duty since he came here. He has left a widow and seven children to lament his loss. Such is war,-a man is kiUed, he is lamented for a day by his friends; other things come in, and only a passing thought is turned to the departed frlend. In fact, it is neceEsary; we could never get on it we were continually brooding over our losses. " Delhi, Sept. 23, " Delhi is in our possession. It was taken by assault on the 14th. It wasan extraordinary scene. At 2 a.m. the camp was aroused by the welcomoe intelligence that the storming was to take place at sunrise. The troops were marched down by the light of a crescent moon to the rear of the advanced batteries. For two hours they waited there, until the right attack on a suburb outside the walls called Kisbengunge wasnmade. This, however, proved unsuccessfuL The Cashmere troops ran,and our loss was severe. The principalattackwas now proceeded with; the Cashmere gate was blown open in the most gallant manner by the Engineers, and our troops marched in. The scaling parties on the right and left took the walls, but with great loss. Pandy was -perfectly unconscious of our movements until the columns rushed forward; the ramparts were now cleared, and the guns turned on the rebel city. Our troops advancedin different directions, and weresucceeding botter than expected, when several stores of bser, champagne, and brandy, placed there by Pandy (be knowiDg too well the character of the British soldier), were fallen in with, and some of the European troops became a drunken rabble. We were driven back some distance, whore we made a stand. Guns were now brought up with mortars, and the firing became incessant against the Maga zine, the first stronghold. Our troops fought well and took a great many guns. Every street had its one or two pieces, whlch pouzed grape into our advancing columns, and could only be captured by the bayonet. General Nicholson re. ceived a mortal wvound while cheering on the men h a second charge at a gun. " On the 21st I rode down to see the Palace; the wal and entrance are the finest part. The interior is dlrty, filthy, and in great disorder, Pandy having revelied in its cool arch. ways. The hall of justice and the ktng's throne are entirely built of white inarble; the latter is inlaid with stones and mosaics. I went all over the state apartments and the harem. The latter is a curious place, and had a remarkable appearance; its floor covered with guitars, bangles, &c., and redolent of sandal wood. The fair daughters of Cashmere had their swing iu the centre of the room. They had left in a great hurry; dresses, siks, slippers, were lying on al sides. " On leaving the Palace I met a doolie, surrounded by some cavalry and a few natives on foot. Its inmate was a thin-faced, auxious.looking old man. This was the new King of Ilindostan, the descendant of the Great Moguls, entering his Palace in the hands of Iis enemies. He was captured sonie dis'ance from the city. Being 85 years of age, his life is t, be spared. He wlU be kept a close pri. soner for life. "Sept. 26. "We are left behind in a camp strewn with dead anlmals in all directions, and with all the filth of three months' eocampment. Within 100 yards of my tent is the churchyard, a very small space, but containing the remains of rearly 1,000 men. The graves are like molehiUs, as close together as they can pack, and on digging a new one the stench that issues is revolting, and the wonder is that a plague has not broken out and taken us all offwhile we are exposed to these things, the sick included. " We have about 4,000 sick and wounded at present. It will rapidly decrease now, I trust, the weather becoming much cooler. Cholera is still oarrying off individuals here and there. It has never entirely left us since June. It Is extraordinary the stillness now, It is, in trath, unpleasant. For three months, day and night, the cannon have been firing; now a musket shot is rarely heard. Do not suppose that I like the noise in preference to the quietness. I do not wish ever to see or hear another gun fired in action. War is certainly an awful scourge, and when these rebels are out up I hope India may long have peace. Our camp is swarming at present with old men, women, and children, without food or money. They have lost everything, and are obliged to be fed by our commissariat. A famine wiU be raging this season aU through this part of India. No fields have been cultivated, no money circulated, so starvation mnst stare them In the face. If it fell upon the Googurs chlefly no one would regret it, as they have committed more mischief than any other tect, but the innocent will also suffer." AN INDIAN MARCH. The follovwing is from an officer serving in lIer Majesty's 53d Regiraent :- C ' Oamp, Duruada, Sept. 24 "We left Hazareebagh on the morning of the 18th, marching 14 miles over a hill country covered with the tbickest junigle, occasionally opening, however, to allow of a little cultivation. The mere walking the 14 mniles -was nothing, buit it was tedious wvork waiting for the guns to pass over every little obstacle, suoh as nullahs, of which there were many. We were favoured by an eclipse for nearly two hours, which kept the greater portion of the effects of the sun from off our heads. "I When we got to our ground we heard that the wretched Santbals had been destroying property and looting villages in the neighbourhood. They are a miserable race, and little better than monkeys, and I believe are very well-disposed if not worked on by scheming blaguards. I saw their weapons, whioh were taken out of some village, con eisting of a bamboo bow and arrow, the string also made of the same material, I believe they are very good shots at 50 or G0yards-perhaps as good as our men are at 200 or 300 yards with the Enfield rifle. " On the 19th we started for another march of 14 miles, intending to cross a broad and rapid river, the Damooda, but just before reaching it it was reported to Major English unfordable for troops, so we halted on the right bank and just short of the river. Having heard that elephants could cross Major English determined upon sending an advance guard across that afternoon, after the men had had their breakfasts, under my command, half the party being orm. posed of the 53d and the remainder the 27th Madras Native Infantry. The two guns followed us on elephants, and, as the bullocks had to swim across, my men had to pull the guns up the opposite bank-a steep bit of 200 yards-to the encamping ground. It carat on to rain just as we corm menced work, about 5 o'clock, whioh quite uplet the Madrassees, so that we had all the work, whiWh took us till past 8 o'clock. However, the men worked cheerfully enough; the difficulty was that the ground was up to the knees in mud, and we had no hold for our feet, which kept slipping, and therefore no purchase to pull on the drag-ropes. The river was about 400 or 500 feet wide, and at the elephantW' ferd abort 7ft. or 81t. deep; Though there was a way across that a man could have gone, but so zigzag that it would have been Impossible to pass Infantry, not to mention its being nearly U.p to the shoulder. The next morning the remainder of the force passed over, and In the evening Major E-- asked if I would volunteer to clear the pass in our front with 50 men, to which I of course assented. In our front there was a very severe ghaut (they caU it), which the mutineers in their retreat had blocked up with trees and other obstacles, besides cutting breastworks At all the most favourable point8 straight across the road, making it Impassable for artillery and cavalry, so that I expected we should have hard work to do, but at night the engineer officer wrote to say that most unexpectedly he had obtained the assistance of 150 Coolies, and that with them he had been able to clear the road sufficiently to admit the troops through. Notwithstanding the road being clear, the major sent me on the following morning early with the 50 volunteers to pitch the tents at the next encamping ground at the top of the ghaut, as aLso to prepare the dinners, telling off the main body as a fatigue party to drag the guns up, so that the volunteers for once got the easiest part of the business. The pass was a very severe one, and the engineer officers must have had hard work the day before, if one could judge by the piles of trunks of trees on the side of the road, The positions for the breastworks were beautifully chosen There were two on the very steep part, one completely commanding the other, and if the attacking party had sueceeded in driving the enemy from them, on reaching the top blown and exhausted a sudden short turn of the road would have exposed the stormers to another fire from ano' ther breastwork within 20 yards. Why they did not make a stand of it there puzzles every one, as they might have defended the pass against an army. Probably we were so long incoming they got out of provisions as on either side of the road there was nothing but the densest jungle of bamboo, and with the exception of this place, 25 miles from the pass, no place behind them to obtain supplies. On reaching the top of the hill, some seven miles from the ziver, we found a nice encamping ground. " The ejected civilians from Durundahad come on ahead and offered our small party breakfast, which we gLadly ac. cepted. While waiting until it was ready the chief com. missioner got an electric telegraph deapatoh from the Governor-General, ordering the whole of the 53d party under Major EDglish back again to the Main Trunk-road. You never saw anything lke the long faces they all had at this announcement, as the commissioner had just had in. telligence on which he thought he could rely, that the mutineers were still kept at bay by the party at the pas, through which they must get through to effect their escape from us, and they did not think that 250 Madras Sepoys with two guns would be sufficient to attack 850 desperate men caught Ina trap; moreover, the retirement of the Europeans would run like wildfire through the district, aud I heard them all say they would not auswer for what might happen. However, nothing could be decided until Major English arrived with the main body. "About 1 o'clock they arrived, all the men thoroughly done up with the work they had had, as the buUocks had to be taken out in several places, and nothing but men attached to the guns. One was heard to make rather a good remark. "I thought," saidhe, "Iwas an Irshman, but I am thinking I am nothing but an artillery bullock." Dlrectly Major English arrived the commissioner was at him, saying that he considered the safety of the province at stake If we were to go back at that moment. He also wrote him a letter taking off nearly all the responsibility from the Major's shoulders. It was long before he would disobey a positive order, but he at last determined upon pushing on, but by forced marches, into Duruda, and, if the cormissioner could not provide us with positive information as to the mutineers, to come back as fast as he had gone. Accordingly, the following morning (Tuesday,the 22d) we commenced our march for this place (Durunda), 21 miles, but it was soon apparent that the artillery bullocks were not able to keep up, and that they would never get in here that night, so we pushed on, leaving the guns to the care of the wing of the Madras Regiment. This was certainly ono of the most enjoyable marches I ever experlenced-the country was lovely, and the climate, being a cloudy day, really delicious. We halted for a couple of hours to cook some grub, and went on in the afternoon, arriving here about 6 p.m. Since the outbreak no Euro. pean has been here, and it was really distressing to see the destractlon and havoc the scoundrels have committed; every house they were' able to burn has been burnt; the stone houses' alone are left, but with everything inside destroyed; not awindow unbroken in the station. The church, a very pretty one, they made a target of, and one cannon.baU has gone through the tower and the organ inside. I was quite astonished to see what a nice place this must have been to be quartered In. A nice climate nearly all the year round, good shooting, boating, bathing, besides a capital soil for agrdens-faucy these blaguards turning the elephan,ts and bullocks iuto aU the gardens, and all the choice plants and trees that have taken years to look after destroyed in this wanton way. " Considering what a nice station it was it is quite extraordinary we never heard of it before. Yesterday we halted, and in the evening, to our disgust, Intelligence arrived that the mutineers had managed to escape through the pass, so that we had had aU the work for nothing; though Iam not sony -we came here as it has enabled me to see a beautiful part of the country that I had never heard of before. We are very comfortably put up in the only house that the enemy have not destroyed, belonging to the acting commissioner, and close to the church. The men are in the infirmary establishment, which, strange to say, has not been burnt down, but the ground was white with the leaves of books strewed about and torn, principally Bibles translated into Hindustani. Yesterday the work of retribution com. menced, and I was in charge of a party who hanged the first man for mutiny. I was told to look for the acting commissioner in the bazaar, and after marching our party aU over the place he told me he had nothing to say to it, so I ordered the prisoner to be hanged on the spot, on the first tree In the high road. A person suddenly coming from peaceful England would have thought it a curious sight to see our small guard in the twilight trying to get the handcuffs off the wretched prisoner, the men all anxious to get away so as to avoid the heavy thunderstorm coming up, at the same time eager to see the sentence of the court-martial carried into effect, the hangman upon the tree hardly discernible, the whole surrounded by thousands of natives looking on. We marched back about fivemilesan hour, but had a heavy ducking. " All the residents are very much disgusted at our going back, as the moral effect of our arrival must be great, the natives here having as much idea of an European soldier as they'have of a whale, never having seen either; and the fact of their being put as prisoners under anuEuropean guard frightens them more than a thousand deaths." " Chuttra, 48 miles due west of Hazareebagh, Oct. 3. "We marched from Durunda back again to Hazareebagh, and thence to this place, in consequence of a report that the mutlneers, 700 strong, with four guns, were on the point of plundering it. owever, we arrived too late to prevent the looting, as on the first evening-we heard they were encamped on the other side of theotown from us, and had already plundered and were plundering. "IWe were then six miles off, and as our force was only rkade up by 180 of the 53d and 120 Sikhs, we proceeded cautiously yesterday morning towards the enemy's camp, just sxirting tue town, and leaving It to the right, and, afterclearing it and halting for a short time to look about us as in the direction of the enemy the hill on the opposite side was so studded with trees and roocks we could not clearly make them out. At last the order was given to advance, and 50 skirmishers under my command immediately went straight through the rice fields between the two hills, and steadily advanced to the opposite side. "We found, muoh to our surprise, that we were at once under a very heavy fire of grape from the guns at the top of the hill, but fortunately it was rather too high to do us nuch harm. We thus proceeded from tree to treo and rock to rock until we could plainly see the enemy's skirmishers and artillerymen worling at the guns, and then continued potting at them until the support came up, when we made a rush at the firsttwo guns and caDtured them. After this the men wero much blown, and could not advance quickly, so they commenced firing again; but unfortunately this time we had one gun in our fiont and one on our left; and in taking protection behind the trees from the gunx in front we were still exposed to a heavy fire of grape from the gun on our left. This was the critical part of the action, and it was here we lost most of our men, as besides the two guns we had skirmishers of the enemy all around us. at last, after a quarter of an hour, which appeared to us to be two hours, the officers all went to the front and proposed to the men to charge and with a dash and a cheer we all rushed past the thbR gun and bringing our right shoulder forward stormed the fourth and last gun. At this the enemy lost heart, and after a few straggling shots retired altogether into the jungle, leavlng us in possession of the field, together with all their camp equipage, four guns, 24 carbloads of ammunition, two colours, horses, ponies, and bullocks. Our loss out of 180 men was 45 killed and wounded, but thanks to Almighty God neither I nor any of the ofmicers were wounded. got a graze in the elbow which tore my jacket open, and another shot through my pouch and belt, the tin inside turning the direction of the ullet and probably saving my life.

MONBY-MARKBT aTn CITY INTLLIGBENOE. I~~~ _ Thirsday Eveiaing. The funds have experienced to-day a further finprovement of a-half per cent., and the market has been more buoyant than at any period for several weeks past. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 90 to i, were first quoted 90i to J. From this they advanced to 90j to J, at which they remained until near the clo of bursiness, when an announcement of a reduction of one per cent. in the rate of discouRt of the Bank of France was followed by several speculative purchases and a further movement to 90k to J, from which there was no reaction. For the 7th of D)ecember the last price was 90 to i. After regular hours there was Again a rise of an eighth. The next account is fixed for the 8th of January, and transactions for that period took place at 91i, or 90 ex dividend. Bank Stock closed at 214 to 216 ; Reduced, 899 to 9 ; and New Three per Cents., 89i to i. In India Stock there was a recovery of 2 per cento, owing to the favourable news just received, and the final quotation was 216 to 218. India Bonds left off at 40s. to 30s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 7s. to 3s. discount. In the Stock-Exchange to-day there was no inquiry for money, and loans on Government securities were freely offered at 5 per cent. At the Bank there was a full, but not an increased demand, I and in the discount-market the return of a better feeling is evidenced by the greater ease with which paper beyond three months' date can be negotiated. In foreign stocks Turkish was principaly in demad, and closed at a further advance. The market generally showed increased firmness. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 99i; Portuguese, 43k and 43; ditto, 1856, 44; Russian Five per Cents., 105; ditto, Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 95i; Sardinian, 88j and 89; Spanlsh, 401; ditto, New Deferred, 25; for the account, 25k; Turkish Six per Cents., 88, 87k, and 88i; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 98 and 9If'; Dutch Two-and-a-Ealf per Cents., 63i; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 96j. The final quotaticn3 of tl'e French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 40c. for money and G7f. 30c. for the end of the month, showing a further advance of a quarter per cent. Gold in moderate quantities continues to flow into the Bank. About 30,0001. was taken there today, of which more than half was French and Russian. A further amount of about 200,0001. in gold is now on its way from St. Petersburg. The arrival has been telegraphed of the Australian mail steamer Simla at Suez with 299,3381. in gold, which together with her mails will be brought by the Tamar, expected at Southampton about the 9th or 10th of December. The mails of the previous steamer, the Emou, which were detained from the grounding of the vessel, were taken from her, it appears, by the Madras on the 18th inst., and wll arrive, with the Indian letters i4 MarseiUles, on the 28th or 29th. The Northumberland and Durham District Bank have not made the slightest comraunication to-day to their London agents. Up to yesterday afternoon the diahonour of their draughts here doex not seem to have been generally known at Newcastle, and the offices of the bank are understood to have been kept open as usual. The idea of any possible restoration of the concern seems to be considered whoUy out of the question, and the prevalent opinion as to the state of affairs that wil be disclosed whenever a thorough itnvestigation is made is very discouraging. Apparently, however, no doubt need be entertained as to the ultimate liquidation of all claims, many wealthy persons being included in the proprietary. Still, it seems that out of the total number of about 400 no less than 112 are unmarried women and widows. Like the Western of Scotland, the bank had been in difficulties before, and had received large aid from the Bank of Eng. land in 1847. The rates of the Bank of France, which were raised on the 11th iust. from 7i per cent. to 8, 9, and 10 per cent., according to the period of maturity, havo to-day been put back one per cent. For the future, therefore, they will be 7 per cent. for bills not having more than 30 days to rum, 8 per cent. for those under 60 days, and 9 per cent. for those between 60 and 90 days. Ever since the advance from 7k per cent. the applications, it is understood, have greatly diminished, and the buUion, which has lately taken a favourabl- turn, continues to augment. Hence, although the step appears rather premature, a hope may be entertained that it wiU not lead to a renewal of difficulty. A meeting of creditors of Messrs. J. and A. Dennistoun and Co., of Glasgow, with branch houses at London, Liverpool, New York, and New Orleans, whose suspension was announced on the 7th inst., was held to-day, when the folowing statement of affairs was submitted by Mr. Coleman, the accountant:- BALCxcE STATE3'T OF AJFAiRS TO 1OEN`BER 7, 1857.

The debts and property in America may be thus classiiied :-695,0001. Is represented mostly by goods and bills receivable of customers, 325,2001. consists of other bills receivable, 140,0001. guaranteed securities, 151,0001. open accounts, and the remainder is composed of railway bonds, mortgages, and various securities of that character, but of the best description. The house of Dennistoun and Co., of Austraia, being a distnct firm, the creditors in connexion with that busiuess will be in a somewhat better position than the ordinary creditors, aa the returns from Australia will accrue more quickly than the proceeds to be expected from the realization of the A!merican assets. Messrs. Dennistoun, as large shareholders in the Liverpool Borough Bank, are necessarily subject to a heavy lIability on acmount of the failure of that institution; but it is believed not only that the 51. call already made will be sufficient to clear off all claims, but that there is every probability this sum will be returned All the transactions of the firm have been on a sound and legitimate basis, and no discreditable act can in any way be imputed to them. Mr. Murray, their London solicitor,thenmade the following proposition on the part of Messrs. Dennistoun-namely,that the creditors of the houses in Great Britain and the United States be paid in six instalments-viz., 3s. in the pound on or before the 30th of January, 1858, 2s. on the 31st of July, 3s. on the 31st of December, 4s. on the 30th of June, 1859, 4s. on the 31at of December. and 4s. on the 30th of June, 1860, with five per cent. lnterest on each instalment; and that the creditors through the Australian house should receive 6s. 8d. in the pound on the 30th of January, 1858, 3s. 4d. on the 30th of June, 5s. on the 31st of January, 1859, and 5s. on the 31st of July, also with interest at the rate of five per cent. In answer to a question Mr. Murray stated that when the first payment is made, promissory notes for the remaining instalments will De given and the proselit aeeeptanees ftneelled. He hoped the proposal would be accepted, as such a course would prove of the greatest assistance, both morally and legally, in the realization of the assets and the enforcement of the claims in America. It was further stated that the accounts from the United States were encouraging, and that a possibility exists of the instalments being paid before the dates fixed, although, on considering the whole circumn stances of the case, Messrs. Dennistoun could not feel certain of being able to carry out better terms. After a short discussion a resolution accepting the proposition was passed unanimously. A meeting was held this n g of the creditors of Messrs. Edwards and Mattfiie, who failed on the 17th inst., with large engagements in the colonial produce trade, but there appears to be a desire to conceal the facts of the ease, and no particulars have been obtained. It is said, however, that a resolution was adopted to wind up under inspection. At the time of suspension the liabilities of the firm were rumoured to amount to 300,0001. or 400,0001., and they were alleged to have obtained large advances on warrants. There have been no further failures in London to-day, and efforts are still being made to resuscitate one or two of the houEes connected with the trade of the north of Europe which have lately suspended. The advices from Hamburg mention the following failures :-Mr. B. Roosen, jun., Messrs. Muller and Kessler, Mr. J. Muller, Mr. Geb. utaben, and Messrs. E. Thiel and Co. Some measures just adopted, however, by the leading mercantile houses had greatly assisted in restoring confidence. The annexed letter, dated the day before yesterday, gives the particulars:- " Within the last few days we have approached a panic that threaaened to bring all mercantile afairs to a stand. The accounts from your side and America and the immense stocks of colonial produce that cannot at present be moved had so mauch depressed the public mind that rumour attacked the best names, and general distrust showed itself. There were ample means here, bnt they were hoarded. In fact, no one would discount any more at any rate, or upon any firm. Everybody felt that something must be done, and promptly, too. Fortunately, the right mneasure was ado pted, and succeeded completely-beyond expectatlon. At half-past I o'clock yesterday, when our Exchange-which is always attended by all mercantile men-was most crowded, a short speech was delivered from the gallery, according to a plan concerted in the forenoon, but not divulged, by a few patriotic and Influential men. The people were exhorted to unite and ehowthe world that the Haniburgh Exchange was strong enough to help itself in this dreadfil calamity, while abroad its general ruin might ke feared. It was propcsed that a subscription should be opened on the spot for a guarantee fund for sound mercantile bills of a minismum amount of ten millions marks banco (S00,OC01.), with 10 per cent. cash paid in directly, under the superintendence of a committee of 13 merchants, constituted on the epot. The proposal was greatly cheered, and it being stated as most desirable that directly af ter 'Change the completion of the sumn required should be telegraphed to London Berlin, Stockholm, &o., everybody considered it a point of honourto be amongthe first to subscribe. Tables were puttin the E;xchange and upstairs, and a dozen subscription sheets were laid out, and rapidly covered with signaturcs for sunas from 801. to S0,0001. The number and variety is very great. Within the hour It was proclaimed that great progrers was made, and before 4 o'clock upwards of eleven milions (859,0001.) were summed up with the 10 per cent. (85,COOl.) ready cash secured, so that the committee might begin their operations to-day. It was a bold aud extraordinary measure; it might interest you to read of it. All countenances brightened up, aud confidence revivcd. Although a good many failures may still become inevitable, the stability of our mercantile community will on the whole be maintained, and after these storms are exhausted we shall have a sound trade. " P.S. After 'Change.-The subscription amounts to-day to about 1,CC0,0001." The following circular annoumces another dividend on the estate of Messrs. Reid, Irving, and Co., who failed during the crisis of 1847:- " 2, Gresham-place, London, Nov. 23. "In our circular of the 14th May last, announcing the payment of a fifth dividend from our estate, we ventured to express the hope that we should be able soon to make more considerable dividends. It is gratifying to us to follow up that opinion by now declaring, with the sanction of our inspectors, a further dividend of Is. in the pound, payable at the above addrers on and from the 30th inst., between the hours of 11 and 2 o'clock. "Creditors holding securities must at the same time present them for endorsement, as no dividends can be paid on bills of exchange without production of the accepted sets, " The funds from which we are enabled to make the above payment are derived from the Maurltius, with a small remittance from Cubba. It has been necessary to retain in hand a reserve of funds, to meet the defence of the suit before the Privy Council (referred to in our last circular) and contingencies connected therewith; but we have every reason to expect that the decision in that case will be confirmatoryof thejudgment in the Mauritius, and will thereby remove every obstacle to the distribution of further dividends. "We are, &c., "REID, IRVING, AND Co." On the day of the stoppage of the Liverpool Borough Bank several respectable firms had their credit damaged by their acceptances being protested, owing to the London agents of the bank having refused payment, although the funds to meet them had actuaUy been paid into the bank in due course. One case is especialy complained of, that of Mr. George B. Kerford, who had an acceptance noted in London at the very time when the Borough Bank had debited him in his passbook for the payment of it. The biU upon its return was, of course, met forthwith by the acceptor; but, as any irregularity at the London clearing-house is noticed and registered by the various bankers, unless explained at the time, the annoyance from such a circumstance is not easily remedied. Some months back it was mentioned that a new process for bread making, patented by Dr. Dauglish, which was alleged to effect great results, by preventing the chymical changes and waste inseparable from the process of fermentation, was about to be tested in the large establishment of Messrs. Carr and Co., at Carlisle. It is now affirmed that the method has been brought into perfectly satisfactory working, and that it will forthwith be introduced. According to the representations made, and which most probably wil soon be extensively verified, or dlsproved, the following are the advanta es to be obtained :-1. There is a saving of the whole of the waste caused by fermentation, which averages fuUy 10 per cent. Thus 10 per cent. more bread ls made out of a sack of flour than by the old process. 2. The process, instead of occupying 8 to 10 hours, is completed in half an hour. 3. The cost of machinery and gas is less than that of yeast used in the old process. 4. The dough requires scarcely any handling to form it into loaves. 5. The bread Is absolutely pure. It is simply flour, water, and sat. Finally, should the whole of the bread in the kingdom be thus made, a saving would be effected of anl amount equal to our entire importations of foreign wheat. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day the examina- tion of the directors of the Royal British Bank wag further adjourned to the 5th of March. The trial of the directors, as now arranged to commence the first week in February, will, it is suppoaed, by that time be concluded, The prospect of the shateholders being able to cazry out the compromise with creditors by raising the sum necessary to pay 69. 6d. in the pound, in addition to the lOs. in the pound expected from the estate, was said to have become more favourable.
MILITARY AND NAV VAL INTELLIGENCE. The folloring chrnges have been made in the disposition of the various dep6ts of the Indian regiments at Chatham garrison :-The 19th dep6t, under the command of Captain L. D. El. Currie, from the huts at Prince Henry'o Bastion: to St. Mary's Barracks; the companies of the 64th Reglment, under the command of BrevetlMajor W. J. Chads, from Brompton Barracks to the huts; the 90th Light Infantry depot, from Chatham Barraoks to Brompton Barracks, In order to enable the authorities to provide barrack accommodatlon for the numerous reoruits who ao daily joinig thv va5do6 Indian battalions at Chatham. The CalypEo, 18, was commissioned at Chatham yesterday by Captain Prederick Bymg Montresor (1851). An evening class hs been established at Brompton Barracks, Chatham, for the instruction of the non-commissioned officers of the PRoyal Engineers in military drawing and fortification. The cass. wblch is under the superin. tendence of Sergeant-Major J. Jones, R.E., numbers about 50 members. The Persian, 12-gun sloop, Commander John H. Chads, is ready at Sheerness for her compasses to be adjusted. The lferon, 12-gun sloop, from Chatham, completed the adjustment of her compasses yesterday. She is to be in. spected tday* her crewr vrill he paid their advance on the following day, and her present or.des are to leave Sheerness on hIonday next for Portsmouth, there to await her final saiing orders,
UZ?EAIPLOYED OFBBATIVyS IN L£ACZASHIP. Captain Palin, the chief constable of Manchester, haS caused a return to bo made showing the state of employment among the operative classes in the city of Mancheater up to Wednesday, in the form usually adopted in times of great depression of trade and distress among the workpeople. By this return it appears that out of 87 cotton millB in Manchester, employing 24,294 workpeople, only 30 mis, employing 10,273 persons, are in fuU work at the present tiue. Of the remainder, 25 mills and 8,439 o le are working short time, and 12 rnills with O,O2 hands are totally unemployed. Of the 15 silk W ils in the town none are fuly employed; but two of them bave coased to run, throwing out of work 1,780 operatives, while at the others 2,853 workpeople are reduced to short time and reduced wages. In the 18 smaUlware mills only 364 persons are working fuU time, while 2,616 are workinz short time, and 320 persons have been wholly thrown out of employ. Taking a total of 233 mills prlntworks, dyeworks, machinisW shops, and foundries, 73, with 16,861 operatives, only are in full employ, while 18,136 persons belongnag to them are on short tlme, and 10,394 are totaUy unemployed. So far the return; but 10,394 persons destitute of employ, and 18,136 reduced to half a oaf, by no means gives the flU measure of distressexisting in Manchester through the present unfortunate depression of trade aiising out of the monetary crisis There are in addition many thousands of fustian cutters and their familiesat aU times only one remove from pauperism-and handloom weavers, mostly working at home or for small masters whose shops are not included in Captain Palin's return, entirely thrown out of employ. There ara no means of estimating accurately the numbers of tbese, but they are very great, and from an unfortunate habit of the fustiar cutters and handloom weavers of bringing up their whole families to the trade the destitution among these people is more complete than among the mill hands. They work together in families, and when work fails they are aU out togetier * but the same family of mill operatives are employed often in different mills, and thus, while one portion are thrown ouxt of work, another may be employed in a mil that has not stopped, or has only partially stopped. Thus, the destitution among the fustian cutters and handloom weavers sooner makes itself felt at the workaouse. Both the workhouses in the township of Manchester are full, and the outdoor relief last week was increased by 501., and this week by 90Z. additionaL The lncrease of cases in the books of the relieving officers last week would be about 500, and as these cases mostly include whole familles (a large proportion of them being fustian cutters), the increase in persons applyiug for relief may be put down at about 2'000. As the township of Manchester is only that portion of the city between the rivers Irk and Irwell on one side, and the river Medlock on the other, this estimate of increasing paupwrism only appl:es to about a third of the population * the remainder, inclnding the larger population of HKufme and Chorlton, sending its poor for relief to a separate union. The populous borough of Salford has also a separate workhouse and board of guardians, and aU that can be said of these is that pauperism and distress in them are rapidly increasing in them, if not in the same ratio as in the township of Manchester. The following is the result of inquiries into the state of trade and of the working population wibhin the distriot extending in one direction from Bluepitsthrough Rochdale towards Bacup, a length of seven miles ; and in the other (including Oldham Road) to Littleborough-an area seven miles by yve. In that area there are 96 mills, as to which information has been gained, and at which 19,125 hands are employed ordinarily. Of the 96 there are six with 1,42' hands entirely stopped, two of them being in Rochdale. Running four days a-week, and employing 5,379 hards-, there are 28 mills in Rochdale ; two raniting four days and a-half, employing 320 hands; seven running three days, employing 1,316 hands t and two running five days, emploing 920 hands. In Roc'dale there are 7,835 persons workIng short time; and in the district, 7,215; giving a tota ofr 15,050, exclusive of the 1,427 altogether neBmployed. There is very little difference in the time worked by the cotton and woollen mills; but the general opinion of employers in the cotton trade is that, except a very great change takes place, they will be compelled entirely to close. The few who are working full time are simply workine up cotton on hand, or completing old orders. Several mills that up t last Monday worked full time are beginning this week to run four days only. The machinists are suffering as much as other branches of trade, for, in some cases, the hands have been reduced nearly one half, and those at work are so for an average of 3A days only. Three of these firms had been running over hours before the panic ; and so preosing had bcen the demands upon them that they had made accommodation for 1,500 fresh hands. One firm states --" We calculate that to keep our mill standing for one week is a dead loss of 701. ; and the universal feeling of the mill. owners is to work as nearly the ordinary time as is at all possible." It is not necessary to add that there is a good deal of distress among the operatives, and that largely increased relief lists are feared by the relieving officers. In the borough of Stockport (situate partly in Cheshire and partly in Lancashire) there are about 49 mills and 'workshops, employing about 17,000 people, and of these 35 are either stopped or working short time, and the pressure for relief at the workhouse has much increased. The distress is beginning to tell rather heavily upon the shopkeepers, and also upon the parochial funds. At the weekly meeting of the guardians the number of paupers in the workhouse was reported to be larger than for some years past, there being 439 (193 males and 246 females), or an ircrease of seven over the previous week, and of 64over the corresponding week last year. At Oldhain the majority of the largest factories in the fown, and the ironworks of Messrs. Platt and Asa and Eli lees still continue running short time, In addition to which large numbers of hands in the latter estabhshments have been altogether suspended; so that the working classes are beginning to safler severely. In Middleton and Tonge thore is also a eat de21 of suffering among the operative classes, particLly the silk weavers, who constitute the bulk of the population of these townships, in conseouence of the complete stagnation in the silk trade. The Oldham board of guardians have passed the following resolution *- "That considering the greatditres which now preval, 1n several d1dricts In this union, owing to the master cotton-spinners, manurestusre, and sUk manufacturers being obliged to work their mUla ahort tisne, it has become the imperative duty ot the guardiams ef tb's unlou to meet the demandsme ne)upon tbemraby tbe operatives In ccnsequeunce of such ehort time in the most effeclual way In their power; and that this board do samre to relieve siteuch cases Is te odinry wy wthot renisng laourtest in return for such relef,it etr l~oo,Ibl fo th gurdins,nder present circom. etanres, to apply such test; and that the Peor Law Poard be respect. fuilb requested to permit such relief to be amin'ster under the discetin o th gurdin, or apsuod f treemouhs.shold the statde of the trade during thiat taime rOematin nIts reeutdeprecsed At Ashton, Bury, Baoup, Barnsley, Bolton, Blackburn, Bnrnley, Chorley, Accrinuton, Colne, Wigan-all places having large populations in the same county-there are numbers thrown out of employment or only on half work, and the distress bears full propotiSon to that in Manchester. PRESTON. Yesterday (Thursday) Messrs. Lawsonl and Shawe, maanu- facturers, commenced running fulltime. They employ a considerable number of hands. Beyond ethis circumstance there is no change In the position of things since the last notie on the sbject appeared in ate 7'tmn, At Ribeohester, ao few lndes from Preston, there is considerable d3stre amOng the hanldloom weavers, but there Is a probability of their obtaining more remunerative employment than their own calling at the Corpoantion Waterworks, in that neghbourhood, acontract for which, aisounting to nearly 8,01. isinthehands of Mr. T.

The resident representatives of the Powers who migned the Treaty of Paris are to meet to-morrow at the Foreign-office, to exchange the ratifications of the treaty relative to the boundaries of Bessarabla. It is sald that the proposal made by the French Government to refer the question of Eolsten to the Paris Conference has not succeeded; the German Powers, with Austria and Pruwia at their head, have declared that it is for the decisoon of the Llermanlc Confederation exclusively. The last accounts from Mexico state that the situation of that country is such, that the French Uharg6 d'Affaires has requested the French Admiral on the station to send some ships of war to the Gulf of Mexico for the protection of French subjects. Several journals have announced that a change of Ministry at Constantinople is irnminent. The in. formation received in official quarters does not, I am assured, confirm this statement, On the contrary, it describes the Ministry as united and firm ; and that, however they may differ on other points, they are all opposed to the union of the Danubian Provinces. A private letter from Milan of the 22d inst. Inforns us that a report lately circulated, relative to the suspension of payment by more than a hundred banking-houses in the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, has been peremptorily contradicted by the official Gazette. lThe financial situation of Milan Is said to be excellent as compared with that of other cities, and, although the stoppage of a house in Ijondon has injured several Italian firms, and one in particular, which is said to have lost a large amount by the London house, stil their balanceaheet shows a considerable nurpluss and, even should they be compelled to suspend payment, their creditors wiU be paid in full. It appears that in consequence of informnation given by Cardinal AntonellU to the French Minister at Rome, some Italians who some time since arrived in Paris have been arrested, no doubt on the :same charge as before, that of conspiracy against the :Emperor. If this really be the case, I may venture to affirm that their passporta, with all due deforence to M. Henri Cauvain, of the ConstitutioreZ, wiU be found perfectly ens r6gle. There seems to be as abundant a supply of these people as of the Savoyard climbing boys; the latter are the ramosteu,-s of chimneys, the others the rarwo7eus of the Throne. A telegram received from Nantes announces that M. Daubigny, the Govexrnment candidate, has obtained 18,000 votes for the department of the Sarthe. Jules Favre, the Republican candidate, polled only 4,000 votes. The ,pectateur speaks as follows of the appointment of M. Chaix d'Est-Ange to the post of Procureur-General to the Imperial Court of Paris :- "M.i Chaim d'Est-Ange's nomination has been hailed at the Palals with the greatestsatisfaction. This distinguished man was oalled to the bar at a very early age, and speediy acquired for himself a brilliant position. He waz equaUy esteemed and beloved both by the Bar and the Bench. It was a pleasure to the judges to try any oause in which he was engaged. He was never hampered by any party engagements, and whUe standing aloof from political struggles he remained consbantly faithful to ideas of order, and knew how, under all circumstances, to maintain the independence necessary to his noble profession. We cannot Sorget that on two or three occasions, when the AssemhlMe ifationale was prosecuted, it found in M. Chaix d'Est-Ange a zealous and eloquent defender, and, although he did not share our political opinions, we could always confi. dently intrust our cause to him. It is not for us either te pralse or blame the acts of the Government, but we have sIncere pleasure in recording the way in which this appointmeat has been received by the public." The Gazette des Tribunauw, thus expresses itself on the came subject:- "We have no need to say with what sAtisfaction and sympathy this nomination has been received by the Judges and the Bar. But, while applauding the nomination, the Bar, we are certain, will feel profound regret at seeing a man who, for many years was one of its most brilliant llustrations, and whose name will remain as one of its most glorious souvcnio,s, leave its ranks" The Three per Cents. closed to-day at 67f. 15c. for the end of the month, and the Four-and-aEalf per Cents. at 90f. 50c.; Orleans RaRlwayshares, 1,280f.; Great Northern, 877f. 50c.; Strasburg, 632f. 60c.; Paris to Lyons and the Mediterranean, 821f. 25c.; Western of France, 632f. 50c.; Bordeaux and Cette, 525f.; Great Central of France, 601f. 26c.; Lyons aud Geneva, 596f. 25c.; Bank of Cr6dit Mobilier, 753f. 75c.; Austrlan Railways, 656f. 25c.; Roman Railways, 490f.; Russian Railways, 490f.

PRUSSIA. (FROM OUR OWN CORnE8POXnDr?T.) BERLIN, Nov. 24. The severe cold that has set in here so suddenly seems to have produced another change in the Royal plans, for yesterday the King and Queen removed from Potsdam to Charlottenburg witho-at taking up their usual residence In the Stadtschloss in Potsdam at all, or waiting at Sans-Souci for the first fall of snow, as the King had so lately decided. The removal took place by land, and along the country roads that have lately been repaired for the occasion. We have no news at present how the King bore the long drive, but as for some time past his daily drives have been gradually lengthened, and his strength has been regularly inereasmg of late, we have every ground for assuming that " no news is good news." The Prince and Princess of Prussia have had severe colds since they took up their residence here in Berlin; and, In fact, it is rather difficult to find any family in which the majority of its members is not affected in some way with colds, sore throat#, or catarrh. The Military Board of the Federal Diet has appointed a special committee to inquire into the causes of the late catastrophe at Mayence,-the explosion of the powder magazine, by which so many 31ves have been sacrificed and so much property destroyed. What little has been learnt as yet shows that on the day of the explosion no work had been done at the magazine in question, although some days previously 500 cwt. of the whole amount of 700 cwt. had been removed from the spot. Further, the Austrian non-eommissioned officer who had charge of the place had fetohed away the keys from the dwelling of his commandIng officer, unknown to the latter; neither the non-comamissioned officer nor the keys are now to be found. The interpretation put on this fact by general assumption in Mayence X, that this man, who was also a flreworkmaker, had been in the habit of purloinlng powder from the magaine, and using or selling it for his own nurno%eq - and, now that the stock was being removed, feeling himself on the brink of detection from the inevitable discovery of the deficiency, to render this im. possible, he had preferred to blow up all that renianed. According to anotherverston,theman,havng already been punished on several occasions, was determnined to take revenge on his commanding officer, and chose the moment for the explosion when the whole corps of officers was to have been assembled In the close vicinity of the magazine at a trial of gyrnastics; this latter had, however been suddenly postponed from some slight anA accidental circumstances which had not come to the knowledge of the cunprit. Mayence is situate in the territory of the Grand Duke of Hesse Darmstadt, but the fortress is one of those federal fortresses the garrison and Governor of which are always Prus3ian or Austran, so that when the Governor is of one s,tate the garrison is of another. At the present moment the garrison is A ustrian, but the Governor is the Prince of Prussia, and his deputy is General -son Bonln. No Prussian miltary were at this time In any way connected with the stock of ammunition In the fortress, and the powder that has been exploded was of that sort used for heavy ordnance, and which is least of all liable to self-combustion. According to Feleral Resolutions the Prussians have the engineering and the Autrians the artlllerydepartment at Mayence, EIMRG. (FBOY R OWN COBR!SPONDcNT.) M i aAMBURG, Nov. 24. Mercantile operatlons generally are almost entirely nominal, and may even be waid to be likely to continue so for some time longer, notwithstanding the great efforts wbich are being made through the whole of the conmmercial conmmunity to keep up public confidence. It is the fir. determinatioa of the higher classes of this community to support the ar,ient reputation of the place by every aiallaole mn,ans. As a further step towards this end, it is with much pleasure r have to mention the formation yesterday of an association of the pincipil leading men of the city, under the denomination of the " Guarantee Discount Asociation Of 1857," for the purpose of guaranteeing the payment of loans made to persons to meet their engagements, and for the payment of any sales of goods, &a., that may be found needftl for the maintenance of credit umder the pressure of existing circumstances, and the total want of mercantile confidence under which all classes are suffering; for rarely has a state of things been experienced in this city such as has been the case for the last few days. The announcement of the intention to form the association in question was made early yesterday morning, and parties were invited to come forward to support public confidence. By 4 o'clock no less than 11,000,000 of marks banco had beqn subscribed, and further sums will no doubt be added. to the fund, of which 10 per cent. has to be paid on account this day; and it is expected that by suh a measure general confidence may immedlately be partially restored All bills and notes for payment ll merely be stamped by the conomittee of the association, and consequently gua- ranteed to the amount of the fund subscribed, which. is the purpose of the measure, as all such bills ad. promissory notes having such a stamp upon them will pass current under such a general public guarantee. All this has been accomplished wt4out the necessity of eoming down with any larger amount than 10 per cent, of the capital subecrbe4.. The affairs of the house of Messrs. Ullberg and Kramer are reported here to have been satisfactorily arranged through the medium of the support giveu by the Government of Sweden to the amount of one million of specie; and the banling-house of L. Solomon Heine, of this city, by the advance of oine million of maris banco. The firm will consequently be enabled to resume its payments as usual, and much evil will thus be avoided to the extensle trading operations in the North. The house of P. A. Millberg here Is reported to have stopped payment yesterday; but it is of secondary consideration, and the amount not large. It is said also that a bill and stock broker decampjd. yesterday after supplying himself with a considerable sum of ready money intrusted to his honour by some persons here. It is supposed he has proceeded to London. A young and handsome English lady, named. Denman, threw herself out of the window of the third storySof Strut's hotel on Sunday afternoon last, and was killed on the spot. She had arrived tbere from a family of high respectability in Mecklenburg, in which she had been a governess. She had dined in her own room a short time previous to committing the rash act, and had written a couple of letters, which she hadprepared for the post, which were found upon the table, and taken possession of by the pollie authorities with her other effects. She possessed a very handsome stock of wearing apparel, together with some trinkets. ITALY.. (FRmox ova owl CoinsuEPoxnmaT.) TURIN, Nov. 23. The degree of influence, corruption, and intimidation That may have been employed by political parties in a general election cannot possibly beascertained by the personal observation of an individual even in his own country, and still less In a foreign land. All that a single observer can do Is. to listen to all parties, consider probabilities, weigh the character and tendencies of the candidates and their chief backers, of voters and their elected, and then, combining with those elements of an opinion such indications as he may himself have noted, take impartiality for his guide, and form the best judgment in his power. And this Is what I have sought to do with respect to the Sardinian elections of 1857, which have returned to the Chamber, according to the most trustworthy computations, deputies belonging to the retrograde party to the extent of nearly or quite onethird of the whole number. In the remaining twothirds may be found a very few democrats, some of whom would, perhaps, be capable of combining with the Right of the Chamber to harass or defeat the Government of Count Cavour. In view of these results, so much less favourable to the present Ministry than was the composition of the last Chamber, the question arises whether that of the present Parliament fairly represents the opinion of the country. The clerical party exultingly declares that it does, that the nation has seen its error, and has gladly retraced its steps to a safer standing. The Liberals, on their part, scoff at this idea, and denounce themselves and their adversaries -themselves for apathy and want of union, their opponents for culpable practices. Without adopting to the ful extent the assertions of either party, we may allow a certain weight to those of each; only I should be disposed to put those of the olericals into other words. Instead of saying that the mass of the nation repents and abjures its errors, I should say that a large portion of the electors, the poorest and most ignorant, have been worked upon and led astray by false representations, and that, while some have ylelded to positive intimidation, others have really been brought to believe that the arrival at power of the retrograde party would be highly beneficial to them, would lighten the taxes, and be in all respects a happy event for the country. General della Marmora's army, excellent as it is, can hardly be said to be so well oreanized a body as that of the churchmen in Sardinia, and it Is easy to understand the immense effect of the good organization of a party before and during a general election. It is to be observed that although, as soon as the result of the first elections was known, the Liberals flew to arms, and rushed to the rescue, beating their breasts, and exclaiming " Mea culpa," this tardy revival of zeal, although it may have prevented greater mischief-and although it certainly secured two or three triumphs, such as the return of Signor Lanza and the advocate Brofferio, which otherwise would hardly have been achieved-did not diminish the ratio of gain obtained by the Opposition on the first day. It was evidently too late; two days were insufficient time wherein to undo the effects of months of priestly skill and exertion. Many electors may have been deluded, and it may be posdible to enlighten them, and to make them see that by voting against the present Government they were untrue to their true interests and to those of their King, but of this they could not be convinced in a day. More time is needed to dissipate the moral darkness that surrounds them. The priests do their work well, spare no pains, and use something stronger than a cobweb to bind those whom tney begune. It is yet too early for the law regulating education to have had muoh effect; years must elapse before it produces an important change among the lower classes, and In the meantime it behoves the Liberal party to be united and active. I think they have had in these elections a lesson they will not forget. They have been rudely roused from their unsafe slumber ; sharply reminded of the dangers of internal dissension when an active and vigilant foe Is at your gates-nay, in your house and on your very hearthstone. Although there are certainly many reasonE for disbelieving that the Chamber just returned doea fairly represent the feelings and good sense of the country, it is by no means surprising that the party which has so greatly mended its position 1hould maintain that it does, and should point to various apparent proofs of this. The Amwnia, in an article entitled "The Head of the Parlla mentary Right," exultingly compares the elections of Count della Margherita with those of the four Mliusters who, not being Senators, had to present themselves to the electors. Della Margherita was chosen in four places, while Rattazzi and Lanza had to go to second elections. Della Marmora was unseated in his old college, although chosen in another, and, although Cavour was returned In Turn by an immnense majority, only think, says the priestly paper, of all the means he commanded to obtain such a result. Count Cavour can afford to despise such base insinuations, which nobody heeds. As regardsSignori Rattazzi and Lanza, their personalunpopularity, shown by the results of the first elections cannot fairly be taken to indicate a change in the political feelings of the electors, who at the second baHlot returned them by large majorities. Count delia Marmora was certainly rejected at Pancalierl, the inhabitants of which place, by preferring to him a retrograde named AsInari (Ang1icr¶, a leader of asses), have drawn upon theniselves the ridicule and sarcasm of all the pap, and have earned a nickname that will long adhere to them., Apropos of that election, the papers pubiikh a letter written on the 16th inst. by Dolla, Marmora to the President of the Electoral College 9f Biella, which had elected. him, and which has thle credit of saving Piedmont from the disgrace of ingratittude to one of her most distinguished sons. Della Marmora wrote, thanking the College for having returned him, but added that he feared he must decline the teat, as he would doubtless be elected for Pancalie4l, and could not refuse to sit for the place which had always honoured him with its confidence since the very commencement of his Parlamentary career. The letter written, but not sent, the General hears a report that he is rejected at Pancalierl. Most people would have postponed replying, or, asthe Unione, when producing the letter, justly remarks, would have torn it and penned a.nother. lut Della Marmora, with characteoistic simplicity and' straightforwardness, merely adda a postacript saying tnat he has just heard 'he is not elected for Pancalieri, and in that case will be happy to sit-for Biella. The Armonia, in the leader referred to above, proclaims Count della Margherita the head of the - Parliamentary Right and ofthe Conservative party, and declares him the moet popular man in the' country. I do not think the country will confim thatjudgment. Arrayedin acompactphalanx, says' the clerical journal in conclusion, the Conservative \ party wil present itself to the Government and the, Chamber, and offer peace or war. "We have' essayed our strength, we have counted our menin this first experiment, and we say to you, ' Either govern with us, or we willgovern without you."' These are rather loud words, and it is to be feared there may be disappointments In reserve for those who speak them.
LOAD CLABREDON 0N ME SLAYE TRAD. .; On Tuesday, the 24th Inst., a deputation waited upon the Earl of Clarendon, at the Foreign-office, for the purpose of presenting a memorial from the committee of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, against the immigration; slave trade, now being cairlea on by the Freneh, fron.-the. westcoast of Africa, It was composed of the following gentlemen :-The Hon. A. innard, hLP., essrs. .K. Hanbury, M.P., Charles Buxton, IP., C. Gilpin, M.P., aptain Wilmot, BN,, Ca ptab Coote, RN.:; the Revs. J. Sherman, Blackheath; J H. Hinton, W Owen, H. Riohard, P.

Wiffin, Woburn; James Cropper, Kendal; E. A. Crouch, Liskeard; John BarowL, Lancaster; W. Dendy i Jamaica; William Pobson,. Stockton; Dr. W. Shaw, and L. A. Chamerovzow, The memorial called the Earl of Clarendon's attention to the address presonted by a deputation from the society to Viscount Palmerston In July last, on the occasion of. the attempt made by the WestIndia body to obtain the sanction of the Government to a general scheme of imnigation from the coast of Africa, and dwelt upon the evils which-as had been predicted-had resulted from the adoption of the schemo by the French Government, through e agency of the Messrs. Regis and Co., of Marseilles. It statod, on the authority of Mr. Consul Campbell, at Lagos, that the Portuguese and the Spaniards had greatly stimulated the trade m slaves, for they Wad outbidden the French in their demands for so-called immlgants, and shipped large numbers of negroes; and, as one consequence of this demand for men instead of commodities the native chiefs were abandoning thelr legitimate commerce to turn their attention again to slavedealing. Quotations were added from the letters of the Rev. H. Townsend, church nissionary at Abbeokuta, and from the Sierra Leone Advertiser, giving special instances of the Injurious operation of the new scheme an1i denouncing it as open slavetrading. The memoriai concluded by expressing a hope that the Governmentwould adopt the promptest means of putting an end to a new traffic In human beings -which, If not checked at once, was likely soon to assume illimitable proportionv, with results as dis. strous as any . that have attend,ed the prosecution of the slave trade itself. The Earl of CLAREbDox expressed the gratification It afforded him to reoive so large and influential a deputation, which he could see, from the list of names handed in, embraced delegates from all parts of the country, Qad might therefore be regarded as an evidencz of the deep and general interest that was felt in the question which the memorial brought under his notice. Such s. deputation was very encouraglngto the Govemment, which he necd scaroely observe was in possesdon of the fuDest information on the subject of this "new system" of obtaining labour-one he did not hesitate to designate as the slave trade unmitigated and undisguised. The whole question, however, had been submitted to the consideration of the French Government, which he believed had not forseen that the result of attempts to obtain inmigrants from Africa would be the revival of the slave trade; and he felt sure nothing was further from the wishes or the thought of the Emperor of the French than to re. open this execrated trafric, in opposition to tho polcy of the leading ivilized Powers, and to the well known national sentiment of this country. The evils could scarcely be exaggerated that must arise from the checking of the legitimate commerce which in many parts of the African coast had totally superseded the trade in slaves, and In others was rapidly extinguishing it. This was a point which bore intimately on 'he commercial interests of this country, and to the Importance of which the Govern. ment was fully alive. The deputation would be encouraged to hear that the attempts of the French agent to obtatn immigrants had been so unsuccessful that he (Lord Claren. don) thought he might venture to say, even on this acoonnt, the speoulation would be abandoned, at least for the pre. sent, and no effort should be spared by the Government to prevent the renewal of a traffc hetwena which and the slave trade there was no appreciable diUference. He asured the deputation of his cordial sympathy w ith the objects of the Anti-Slavery Society, and his concurrence in the sentiments set forth in the memorial.
BEFOBMATO1UES. TO THE EDITOR OF TIHE TIMES. Sir,-A letter appears in your columns of Tuesdayheaded, "Smith-street Reformatory," and contaiing apparently very strong charges against that establishment, RedhtiD, and reformatories and prisons in general. I am not unused to meeting with gentlemen who declaim learnedly in this style, though, happily, the number Is fast diminishing ; but it curiously happens that in answer to my first question, " What experience have you had in prisons and reforma. torles i"-when I get an answer at all, which without uacourteous pressing I seldom can do-it appears that the gentleman has read some blue-books on prison statistics, or spent an hour at Redhill, seen the boys (through his own strongly-tinted spectacles) at dinner or play, and then returned to London with a f ll conviction thathe knew "all about it." Now, Sir, were I to spend. an hour in walking through a merchant's counting and warehouses, watch carefully for five minutes a clerk copying a letter and a cooper paoking a eask, and provide myself with the most accurate statistic as to the height of the stools and desks, and from these data were to write elaborate strictures on the prospects of trade and its effect on the civilization of the human rae dobn'at yiou think people might say that I did not know "aCl'l Mr. " I. H. E." much marvels that Dorsetshire labourers do not become thieves in order to get into prison. The reason probably is that eitherj they or some of their aequaintance have been there (an advatage, tprobably, not enjoyed by MIr. ". HE. E."), and it is not so pleasant in practice as in Mr. "IL H. E's" theory. But it that gentleman is fond of difficult problems, the following may interest him. I happen to have a reformatory ln Glocestershire. The boys are well fed and apparently and really happy. I have for some years received every boy, on his second conviction, that the magistrates of the county thought fit to Bend me--i. e., nearly every one. Surely, according to Mr. 111 H. EV's theory, the inevitable consequence must have been that we should have had a general scramble among all the boys of the county, for who could be maost criminaL. Yet, most perversely, the number of applicants has so faUen off, that my school would have died out for lack of boys had not the Brlstol magistrates kindly given me the piok of theirs. In Cheltenham, for some years, the average number of convictions of boys ander 16 amounted to nearly 50 ; this last year it was 14. In 12 months we have had but four second convictions in the whole county., Will Mr. " I. E." tell me how to account for this-.on his view t If, indeed, it should lead him to endeavour to master the subject in the way in which alone it can be really under. stood-vIz., by spending some days at the very least in examining the routine and detais of a reformatory, and that, if possible, with an unprejudiced eye-I think he would find the solution of the problem tolerably esr and I am quite sure that he would then in the most gentlemanlike manner write to you and confess that he had written in error, arising solely from his entire ignorance of the sabject, T --*; Rir --aw leA-X-4. -As_ T.-].

THE GOLDEN FLEECE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Permit us to correct an unintentional error in your impression of to-day respecting the departure of the steam. ship Golden Fleece, which is mentioned as having sailed on the 6th of August. She leftSpithead at 4p.m. on the 8th, and made the run to GaUe (Ceylon) In a few hours under 60 days. This alteration is very important. Great interest is attached to the reapective performances of this ship and the great clippers which saUed for India with troops. The Golden Fleece, James Baines, and Champion of the Seas left Spithead on the same day, the first-named vessel getting. under way fonr hours after her sailing competitors both of wFhich she has thoroughly beaten in the long race to India, neither of them having yet been reported.

":Ms was a6 petition for the prolongation of £, patent granted to Mr. Empson in JTanuary, 1844, for an improve. mnent in the manufacture of linen buttons. The rotmnd upon which the extension of time was sought was, thatthe cetitioner had been com.npelled in consequenoe of losses icurred by leagal proceedings to make over the patent to another person, and to pay him for a license to use It, and had therefore not received since the granting of the -patont more than 6,4931. This ~sum, it was contended, was less than the ordinary profits of the trade in which the peti. tioner was engaged, and was not a fair remuneration for the Ingenuity he had displayed in, the livention. MNr. Eindmarch appeared for the petitioner ; Mr. Welhby watched the case on the part of the Crown. Mr. P xBnrow IisGr said that assaming .everything alleged in the petition to be true, tioir Lordsip. were ot opinon that there was not tbe least pretence for granting any extension of the patent.

It appeared from the opening statement of Mr. Atherton that the Staleybridge Com. missloners were 21 in number, And the whole of them went out of office annnally, but were eligble to be re-elected. The commissioners chosen in May, 1855, appointed the plaintiff to be their clerk, and'this appointment was renewed by the commissioners chosen in May, 1856; but in May, 1857, he was removed by the commissioners who were then chosen. After the election in 1855 objections were taken to the validity of the election of the commissioners, and proceedings were taken in this court by maldamus to have a new election, which, in fact, toolkp]ce in July, 1855. A soctiny took place, and the commissioners ratified the pla't's appointment. The plaintiff, had done the business, -for which he now sought to recover, between May, 1855, and May, 1857, and he brought his action against the present clerk to the coimissioners. Lord CAMPB3uLLI-Treating the commissloners as a continuing body-as a quag corporation. Mr. ATEOiTON said there was a section in the local Act which enabled parties to sue the clerk. Mr. WxrsBy here said he did not think there would be any dispute as to the facts. He admitted the facts as opened, and said three questions would be raised; first whether the plaintiff could maintain any action at all, upon the ground that, as the expenses were all charged upon the rates, a mankamus was the proper remedy; secondly, whether the present. commisioners were liable to be sued, as they were not a continuing body; and. thirdly, whether the duties in respect of-which the plaintiff's claim was made wore not covered by his salary? Lord CrmIPBELL said he had taken a note of the facts, and he would reserve those three questions of law for the opinion of the Court. The bill, if necessary, might after wards be referred to the Master. Verdict for the plaintlf subject to the opinion of the Court on the points of law. TAYOR V. WAGsTAFF. MTr. Edwin James, QC., Mr. Petersdorff, and Mr. Cook Evans appeared for the plaintiff; and MIr. Skinner, Q,C, and Mr. Fry for the defendant. The plaintiff, S. G. Taylor, was a house agent, at No. 3 Grosvenor-street, Bond-street. and he sied the defendsnt W. R. Wagstaff, a medical man, of No. 38, Cannon-street, to recover the sum of 801, as agency charges for selling a lease and furniture belonging to the defendant at No. 20, Grosvenor-street. It appeared from the plaintiff's statement that on more than one occasion he had been employed by the defendant to let the house in question, which the plaintiff had succeeded in doing, and received payment for his services. The plaintiff had made an Inventory of aU the far. niture, and, as the tenant was about to leave the house, the plaintiff was instructed by the defendant in the early part of the year to find a purchaser for the lease and furniture. The plaintiff fixed the price at 1,4001. On the 26th of May a Mr. Wordsworth, a surgeon of Finabury-square, applied to the plaintiff for a houso, and the plaintiff gave him the particulars of No. 20, Grosvenor-street, and showed him over it, intimating that probably tho defendant would take 1,2501. Mr. Wordsworth took away the inventory and in a short time returned'it to the plaintiff, saying that he should not give mor than 1,0001., but that he wished first to get rid of his own house. The plaintiff gave Mr. Wordsworth the defendant's address in Cannon-streot, and advised him that, as they were both medical men, he had better call upon the defendant and endeavour to arrange the matter. It appeared that MLr. Wordsworth had applied to another agent-Mr. Debenham-to seU his (hr. Wordsworth's) house, and through Mr. Debenham he made an offer to the defendant to purchase the lease and furniture in Grosvenorstreet for 1,0001. This offer was accepted, and an agreement was concluded which purported to have been signed on the 10th of July. In the meantime the plaintiff had heard of the negotiation, and on the 8th of July he called on the defendant and warned him that If he concluded the sale with Mr. Wordsworth through Mr. Debenham he (the plaintiff) would stiU look to the defendant for his commission, as Mr. Wordsworth had obtained his information respecting the property at hlis (the plaintiff's) office. The defendant however, concluded the agreement with Mr. Wordsworth, and on the 10th of July wrote to the plaintiff to send him the inventory, as he had particular use for it. The plaintiff then sent in his bill, but the defendant refused to pay any thing. The present action was then brought, and the plaintiff now relied not only on the general custom in the trade, which the witnesses said entitled the plaintiffto his commisson, but also on the special terms upon which he alleged the defendant had contracted, as shown in the plaintffPs card, which contained the foUowing clause:-" The commission is chargeable to the vendor, and will be inourred If the treaty should not be concluded by S. G. Taylor, provided the property Is disposed of through information obtained at his offices." The defence was that the negotiation with the plaintiff had been entirely broken off, and that when Mr. Wordsworth was with Mr. Debenham respecting the sale of his (Wordsworth's) house, Mr. Debenham had introduced the house in Grosvenor-street to his notice, andathat, upon that, he (Wordsworth) employed Debenham to offer the defendant 1,0001., which offer was accepted. The defendant was called, and said he knew nothing of Mr. Wordsworth until after the agreement was signed; he admitted the plaintiff had wvarned him that he should look to him for his commisdion, but he thought that that was ater, and not before, the 10th of July, wvhen the a_rcement was signed. It was al8o contended that the plaintIfhad neglected his duty in not communnicating to the defendant the name of Mr. Wordsworth. Lord CAMPBELL said he thought the custom allegedwa clearly proved, and, in part, was admitted|; and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, unless the jury should be of opinion that he had failed in his duty. The jury found for the plaintiff-Damnages, 251. lOs. \VILLIASCS V. BOODLE. Mr. Whateley, Q.C., and Mr. W. H. Cooke appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. Powell for the defendant. This was an action for a malidous prosecution, which was not concluded when the Court adjourned. We therefore defer our report.

Wood wore counsei for the plainhffs; Mr. Serjeant Thomas appeared for the de. fondlant. This was an action brought by a husband and wife against a cayman for carelessly driving over the wi,e. The male plaintiff Is a labourer at the docls, and his wife is a shoebinder. She was crossing High-street, Whitechapel, at 10 o'clock at night, on the 2d of April last, and the defendant, who was seen driving a cart along the street at full gallop, drove it against her. She was knocked down, and the cart wvent over her, and upon being taken to the London Hospital it was found that four of her ribs had been broken on one side and five on the other, and that her shoulder was dislocated. The defendant never stopped, but drove off after the accident; and it was now necessary for the plaintiffs to call several witnesses to prove that the defendant was the man. At the close of the plaintiffs' case, the learned counsel for the defendant announced that he did not intend to call any witnesses. The Lord Cmxv JumSTCE, in summing up, told the jury hat a good deal of time had been wastedin endeavouring to prove thatthe defendant was not the person who caused e inJurles; and it wvas nO extenuation of his conduct that he~did not now dare to go into the w;itne3s-box. A juryinan then inquired what was the condition in life oE the defendant ? It appeared that he was a carman, carrying on 0 Small business with his mother, and keeping two or three horses, In Hunt-street, WhitechaepL The jur7 then found their verdict for the plaintiffisDamages, 251.

COURT OF EXCHEQUER. TnuRDnAVT Nat 9M ,Stings at KiL .Prias, bfo7c Mr. B73aron BBRAMWL.) hese sittings commenced to-day with an entry of 68 causes, of which four only are marked for trial by special juries. In addition to tho above there are two revenue causes. OORNXLL V. HlUDSON. Mr. Gibbons was counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Hsi* and Mr. Hannen appeared for the defendant. This was an action In which the plaintiff sought to recover damages from the defendant, who in the keeper of the Queen's Prison, for illegally, maliciously, and unlawfully depriving him of oertain goods and chattels whioh were aritiles necessary for his use as a prisoner, and also for improperly and oppressively refusing to allow the plaintiff to enter the prison after his discharge. The detendant pleaded "Not guilty," leave and license, and a justification of his conduct under the rales and regalations for tho go. vernment of the prison. The plaintiff is or was a "War. wickshire welldigger," ag his learned counsel described hin, and in 18-13 fell into litigation with the authorities of his parish, against whom he brought an action for Illegally distrainig his goods for poor-rates. That action resaulted in a verdict for the defendants, and the plaintiff was cast into Whitecroesstreet Prison for the oosts. From that plaoethe plaintiff caused himself to be removed to the Queen's Prison, an establishment of a much more agreeable character. The plaintiff was first placed in the second class, where he, as uual, received an allowance from the county of 5s. per week for six months, and then one of 3s. 6d.; but when that allowance was discontinued he was removed into the third claes. In both classes he undertook the discharge of certain menial offices for other prisoners, for which he was either paid in coin or by presents of furniture, wearing apparel, or anything else which the donor had no further use for when he quitted the prison. The plaintiff had thus amased a tolerably comprehensive store of goods, and his. Erst oomplaint was that all this property was tyrannically taken from him when he was removed to the third class in 1853, and was now detained by order of the defendant. As to the second cause of complaint, he alleged that after he had obtained his discharge, in 1857, he repaired to the prison for the purpose of collecting his debts, but was improperly refused admission by order of the defendant, though, as one of the public, he conceived he had a rlght to go in if he so pleased, the prison being as open to the public as this court itself was, subject to good conduct on the part of all who entered its walls. Such is the substance of the plaintiff's evidence in chief. On crbosexamination he admitted that he had brought a second action against Mr. Hudson, and another against Mr. Justice Wightman, for having maliciously allowed the defendant in that case to plead the Statute of Limitations, and had actualysucceeded inthrowingintothe Royal carriage apetition to the Queen for redress against his attorney for not appearing in court at Warwick in 1843 I-an act of occentricity which led to no other result, as we understood, than that its author was confined for a short time, till his real and inofensive character could be ascertained. Mr. AnSTY, in addressing the juny, stated that the defendant had for many years discharged the duties of his onerous office with credit to himself and advantage to the public, as well as to the entire satisfaction of the Secretary of State. The present action was an illustration of the difficulties attached to the performance of those duties, and he trusted that the jury would by their verdict protect the defendant from that which was a most unfounded claim. The learned gentleman then went into a long statement of facts connected with the plaintiff and the proceedings which led to this action, and in support of that statement caUed Mr. Charles Colwell, the head turnkey of the prison, 'who proved what the plaintiff called his goods and chattels was for the most part bones, rags, rubbish, and odds and ends which he had picked up from the dustbins and among the yards of the prison, which had become so offensive as to be dangerous to the health of all the prisoners. In consequence of an infraction of the rules touching beer, repeated after caution, the plaintiff was consigned to the strong-room, and afterwards removed to other rooms into which he was not allowed to take all the filth above alluded to, but only such portions as were fit and proper for use, and was requested to send the rest away. The plaintiff, however, said he wo-dd have " all or nothing, " and the officers made the selection in question, giving him such things as were necessary, reserving other articles for the plaintiff heroafter, and burning the residue which had been condemned by the surgeon as provocative of cholera. After this Mr. Hudson through his active interference procured a grant of money for the plaintiff from a charity in the hands of the Goldsmiths' Company, and by these means the plaintiff was set at liberty. On the day after his discharge he called at the prison and was told he might have all his goods if ho would go to the room where they were, and take them away, but this he refused to do, saying, as he had done before, that as the defendant had taken them away In the first instance he ought to restore them; but It was distinetly sworn that he never hinted at any desire o enter for the purpose of seeing any prisoner or collecting his debts, if any existed. Beyond this occasion the plaintiff never'sought to enter the prison, and the good's, such as they -were, Were now at his disposal. The Jury, as soon as these facts had been deposed to, turned round an, af ter a short deliberation, said!they were quite satisfied, and that in their opinion the action was one which ought not to have been brouht. Mr. Baron BRAMWELL.-I quite agree with you, gentlemen. The plaintiff seems to be a man who considers that all the world is leagued in a conspiracy against him. He be_ins with the parish officers and goes up to my brother Wightman, and I dare say he won't stop there. This is clearly an action which ought not to have been brought ; for, so far from the defendant oppressing the plaintiff, It seems that he treated him as tenderly as though he had bean the most deserving of men ; and, as to the subject-matter of the second count, rhe plaintiffs account of what took place was utterly contradicted by a most unexceptionable witness. There must be a verdict for the defendant. Verdict for the defendant.1

The CoURT stated that they hoped to give judgment on 3onday in the cases of " Muggletone v. Barnett," "M harriage v. The Eastern Counties Railway," and "Colin v. Wright." LAING V. WHALEY AND ANOTH . rrom the speeial case it appeared that the plaintiffs in error, now the defendants, were poseessed of certain coal mines, and had been in the hahit of using water from a cut from the Leeds and Liverpool Canal for the works of their mine, but the now plaintiff erected some chymical works and poured such quantities of xauriatic acld into the canal that the water was so Impregnated with it that it became noxious and injurious, so that the now defendants could not use such water us they had before done. The present defendants then brought their action against the plaintiff to recover damages for the injury they had sustained. An arrangement had been come to that the question should be left to a gentleman of the bar to say whether any and whatdamage had been su9tained, and that the questions of law should be turned into a special case. The bar rister had fonnd a verdict in favour of the then plaintiffE. The technical questions in the special case now came on for argument. Mr. Anderton appeared for the present plaintiff, and Mr. Mtlward for the defendants. The COUrLT took time for consideration.
COUBT OF BAfKRUPTUY, Bm gLaVstrcd, NQov. 26. Ll RE THE ROYAL BRITISH RANT. (Before. Mr. C&mmLs.ion-r TTnTiznvn Mr. LUNjAT1ER-In tho matter of the Royal British Bank your Houour was pleased to appoint to.day for the purpose of the directors -who havo been called upon to file the balance-sheet and accounts of the bank passing their last examinatior. In consequence of an intimation from the Court on another occadon, and also from the anxious desire which the assignees have that the gentlemen who are to be put on their trial with reference to the affairs of the Boyal British Bank should have the moat ample opporta. nity of preparing their defonce, aud that nothing that transpires at tho instance of the assignees should by any possibility prejudice the case, it has been considered better to abstain from that discussion of the balance-sheet which otherwise would have been entered into. Your Honour may probably be aware that on the application of Mr. Cameron and Mr. Stapylton the trials that were appointed to take place at the sittings after the present term have been postponed tlll the sittings after Hilary term, and no doubt those trlals will be specially appointed, and will commence in the first week of the rmonth of February. I repeatlthat the object has been to give every opportunity to the defendants of preparing their case for trlal, and the assignees are also most anxious that every opportunity shbuld be given to them of gettlng up their case in the best possible manner. It would be no satisfaction to the assignees, It would be no satisfaction to the Crown, and It certainly would be no satisfaction to myself or to the public, if the trials were to take place without every opportunity being afforded to the defendants of answering the charge that is made against them. Under these circumstances it has seemed to the assignees better that this Sitting should be adjourned. They are upon that subject entirely in the hands of the Court, They feel it is not a case in which they could permit the last examination to pass stzb sientio. Thoy also find thait the balance-shoets which have been filed require very considerable altera. tion, that they are open to objection, and that amendments wiU be required. We shall be able to givo tho directors who have filed these balance-sheets notice of the ;particular ground of objection. It seems, therefore, that it would be better, under these circumstances, that the last examination should beadjourned until a period alter that when it may be expected the trials will terminate. If they are to commence in the fint week in February Lord Campbell intimated that there would be a month open for the trials. I do not think his Lordship is very far out in the computation of time necesary for the purpose, unless, indeed, previously, as has been hinted, some arrangement could be made with reference to the accounts and other matters which will save the time of the Court. Under these circumstances, I should think that some early day in March would be better than au earlier period, and that it would be fairer te the parties, and nore likely to attain thi3 ends of justice if this sitting were to pos without further comnment, and the examiltion were adjourned until about the 5th of March. Ido not know tbat that will be objeted to by any of the parties who arze here, and who are well and ably represonted '. aet Mr. 5sn ED.- On the part of Mr. Stapylton weareW quite wlling to assent to the adjournment. We believe that the account we have rendered is a proper account. Whatever objectionh it my be open to we shall bear hereafter, and then we shall have the opportunit7 ofi am=endin it if secesarY. I will zolY say, as this subec'tt has there is one other atter oin the part of Mr. Sta*ylton which I wish to xsention -namely we wein desirous tha bet nofh dela enoudantsi n an ely weare nIo daesirfous tato eno ndey sall them th)pace in availin,, ourselves of the opportunities which the assignees hatve expressed their anxions desire that we should nave. Access to the books Is, we think, indispensably necesary to the inveboig, tion of this case. I am quite awaxe that thes documentg have been mainlyin theandsof the Crownfortheprepa ration of the trial, butthe time has now come whpnIt ig essential for the defence of these gentlemen that they should have an opportunitY of inspecting those documents and I should k, with your Honour'l prmission, that some arrangement mday be made under wthi we shall have full access to these documents, Mir. Ld iTzn.-I sm quite ready, on the paot of the assignees, to assent to any arrangement that wiil fracilitate the object of the defendants. I can only say I have a thord to each and all of them the fullest posible opportuni Of access to the hooks. I have told them that from 9ncoock in the morning until 6, or even to a later hour in the evein ing, if they pleaye, they maY on rny and every day of the week (Sunday, of cour6e, excepted) have access to the booka, I believe the only quettion which M. Frethabsela would desire now to introduce is one as to which observatioen has been made in his affidavit. He says he thinks it necessary for the defence of hif client that for several weeks together he, with profesndonal asstancoe, should have the opportunity of Inspectinh the books and collecting all the documents together wito y r vision and without control. Now, to that I cannot yield, for this obvious reason, and one I think which Mr. Fresh. field will readily as,ent to, that some of the material matters involved in the consideration of the trial appear in pencil in viaous hooks, aud are liable to obliterationn; and it eems to me that itIs quite impossible forthe assignees to permit, not one, hut eight or twentgyoTntlemen, to have the opportunity of using every bo just as they please. I san quite prepared, if Mr. Freshfield, or say one else representing any of the defendants, will give notice of what books they require, to have them placed on one side ino order that they mxy have the opportunity of Inspecting them, But it seems to mes that there is no reason for departing from the ordinary rule, which is that books are to be produced under the authority and by the direction of the assilgnees,and, in the language of the Act of Parliamnent the assignees are to appoint some person to attend ucn btose whose inspectionL is permitted with the books an& papers of the bank. I am moat anxious, as I have already told Mr. Freshfield, to do justice to the defendants, and I wi very willingly sacrifice any convenienoe of my own for the purpos of enabling the defendants to have the opportunity of accen which they think material for their defence. eir. Forshn.rBt said he should not ask for leave to Inspret the documents without proper supervision, and that he oad no complaint to make. Mr. LoRLATER.-Wi are quite agreed, then. Mfr. M.AsoN, for Messrs. Gillott, Butt, and Hlurst, throee of the directors, urged that they should he permitted to pass. Mr. a inaLATot left the maitter to the Court. The COM teIlNdR.-dThe official assigtee in the a rtst instance ought to be able to verify the accounts of this particular estate of these three gentlemen. If it is at all neceseary to go into the merits, it would be much better we should not advance at all in that direction. Mr. Iadi sToR.-There s may pbhably be some misapt prehersion in onrequence of wht has falen fromthe Court with reference to the Inspection of the books by those of the defendants only who havebeen called upon to prepar the balance-sheets. There are other gentlemen included in the nformition. Buxt on bebalf of the assignees we have offered theml the fullest opDortunity of inspecting the books and given them the same ~pportunity of access which they would have had under the technical rights the othersB have bad. The Comi,nIsioNgR.-That Is all quite zight, Mr. eitsxv oAul then explained the postion of the estate, alludinT to the negotiation pending for the diposal of the Welsh m(ines to the landlord, and stated that i that negotiation were concludea a dlividend woula be made withont waiting for further funds. After a discussion respecting the compromise with the sbareholders, in the course of whieh Mr. s wRecocn stated that a client of his had increased his contribut-ion from 1,0001. to 2,0001., and that he had a confident expectation that the amount, or very nearly the amount, required to complete the arrangement with the creditors would be obtained, The meeting was adjourned to the 5th of March.

INSOLVENT DBBTOB& COUBT, AV*v. 26. _ , I RE WOOLF LEVY. (Before Mr. Commi.ssione Pm .T.TTpq I .uw iusoivenz, whose former hearings have been reported In tie YTmes, appeared again to-day. 3fr. Dowse and Mr. 3acrae appeared for the detanilng creditors, for Messrs. Wilsonand Bitchie, of Colombo, merchants, the Cape of Good Hope Bank, and for Mr. Ben. Eon, tobacconist, of Oxford-street; Mr. Sargood and Mr. Reed aupported. The case had stood over for the production of a gentleman at Bristol, named Taylor, who was said to have valued certain jewels which the Insolvent had mentioned in his schedule as being worth 6501., and available for his creditors, whereas it appeared that they had been sold by a Mr. Devereux, with whom they had been deposited, for 741., and the procecds applied in liquidation of a debt due by the insolvent. Mr. Taylor was examined this morning, and stated that when the jewels were exhibited to him he refused to purchase them, and he subsequently told the insolvent they were worth less than 1001. Insolvent said he had sold them for 2501. or 3001., upon which witness told him he was a very lucky man. Mr. Dowsn then addressed the Court in opposition to the discharge. The insolvent, he contended, was not a person who was entitled to the benefit of an immediate discharge. His difficulties were not the consequence of an unsuccessful course of honest trading, but had been brought about by a system of the most reckless misconduct. Messrs. Wilson and Ritchie were creditors for 2,350l., having been induced by the insolvent to cash a draught for ,6001. drawn upon Baring and Co., of London, by Burgoyue and Co., of San Francisco. This draught the insolvent alleged that he had purchased of one James King, banker, of San Francisco, paying 1001. as a bonus, but upon presentation it was not accepted by Barings. It was most extraordinary that the insolvent, who was acute enough to be able to realize, according to his own statement, 3,2001. by specula. tions in California,who had cbeated the Americans by selling wooden nutmets, and who had managed to contract debts in all parts of tne world, sheuld have been innocent enough to purchase a valueless instrument, and yet sharp enough to get rid of it to Meessrs. Wilson and Ritchie. The Cape of Good Hope Bank were creditors for 7981., the amount they advanced upon draughts ven by the insolvent upon Sir Moses Montefiore, but vwhch had been refueed acceptance. The insolvent arrived at Cape Town, according to his own statement, on the 24th of August, 1855, with 501. in his pocket, and on the 6th of October followlng he was arrested at the suit of the Cape Bank. In the six weeks that had intervened between his arrival and his arrest he had managed to expend the 8001. reeeived from the bank and 1131. which he obtained from Messrs. Ross and Co., merchants, In addition to a debt of 601. to an upholsterer for fitting up his cabin on his voyage home. He remained in Cape Town Gaol until October, 1866, when he was discharged by the bank, and immediately came to England, where he was at once arrested upon a criminal charge, which was diposed of in February, when he was released, but ImmMotely re-arrested for debt at the suit of the present opposing creditors. Since February, 1854, when the belaucesheet commenced, tho insolvent had received in money and contracted debts to the aggregate extent of 8,789l., which had all been got rid of, and nearly the whole in the short space of 20 months from February, 1854, to October, 1856. The insolvent had contracted the debts of the opposing creditors fraudulently, inasmuch as he had assumed false names, and had held himself out as a person of wealth and station. In the case of ]Mr. Benson, the tobacconist, a creditor for 521., he had been led by the insolvent's appearance to believe that he was dealing with a gentlemau of wealth and Importance, seeing that ie had put up at the Clarendon Hotel, and called for his cigar in a broughaum and pair of horses, with the attendant accessories of coach. man and tiger. Mlr. Commissioner PHILLIPS doubted whether a case of fraud could be established in the absence of the individual creditor at whose suit a remand was prayed. Mr. Dowes submitted that there were cases in which It was plain from the schedule that there had been no inten. tion of payment. It was so In this case, and certainly there could have been no expectation of payment. lJpon those grounds he prayed the Court to pronounoe a heavy remaud, should it be of opinion that the achedule ought to be allowed to remain, notwithstanding Its manifest inaccuracies. Mr. Commissioner PsMLLps direted the att-ention of the insolvent's counsel to this latter point, whereupon Mr. SABGOOD contended that the objection to the schedule ought to have been taken at an earHer period, and moreover, the contradictions between Mr. Devereux auu the insolvent were sufficiently doubtful to allow the latter to claim the benefit of any hesitation, and to ask for an imme. diate adjudication. The learned CoxmnmnsSoNxm thought it was the duty of the Court to ascertain whether the schedule was true or not. It was quito clear that It was not true in the present instknce, as it contained an entry of " jewels depoEsted with Mr. Devereux for ale worth which were available for the creditors" That was not true, because Mr. flevereux bad sold the jewels 12 mnonths ago for 741., to repay himself, as he stated, for money advanced to the insolvent. Then came the, question whether the misstatement was intentional or no+t The Court must decide whether Mr. Deverneut and Mr. Taylor were to be branded with perjury or the insolvent. for It was impossible to suppose there could have been any mistak.e. Looking at the manner in which the insolvent had denied all knowledge of letters which the Court could not doubt had been written by him, and which bore the gildied impress of his coat of arms, there was every reason to sup. pose the witnesses who had been called bad sfok truy- Thatibed ingdso,a undbeievngdter chedulet stt obe ofalse,n Athe oe%l h novett rpr e schedule. n produced in n sp port of the application an affidavit rmade by the insolvent, ini which he swore that he was utterly desti.
ORN.TRAL 0IMINAr COUR', Nov. 26. OLD COURTI- VWV-v cMr r. JIuttce COLERIDGE and Mr. Baron WATSON.) Jame Banley, 23, and John Ermbleton, 43, were charged with forging a Plost-office order for 21. Mr-. Bedim and Ur. Clerk conductbed the procuction; Mr. Ribton defended Bagley; Embleton was undefended. It appeared that on the g30th of October Mr. Robert ~ldo, a gentleman residing int the nelgbUourhood of Poole, in orsetahire, enclosed a money-order for 21. to his grandson, Mr. W. J. Slade, at 422, Strand. The letter, upon iht 1irTval, was placed in an envelope with two others and redirected to Gnild.ford.street iand posted at Charing-cross, but it didnot reach its destination. On the 2d of November Mr. W. J. Slade, who was in expectation of receivlug the raoney-order from his grandfather, applied to the moneyorder-offlce upon the subject, and upon his statement, and the office having received advice of the payment of the money at Poole, a duplicate order was issned, which was signed by Mr. Sade, and the money vas then paid to him. Ov the same day the prisoner Embleton made his appearnace at the money-order office and presented the missing Tmoney-order, which was signed "J." Slade. He wan told that this was not the proper signature, and he went away .nd returned soon afterwards with the order signed "W.; Slade." The Post-office authorities had in the meantime become aware of what occurred with reference to the moneyorder, and the prisoner was asked how be became oessed of it, avnd the explanation he gave ws.- that he had been sent by "Jem" Slade, or a man who is known by that liame, who was a penmaker, living at No. 13, Brydges. street, to get the order cashed, and he was to receive half-acrown for his trouble. The Post-office constable told the prisoner that he should go and inquire for Slade at BrydgesWtreek, and Embleton then said that he lived at No. 11 and mot 13, and if he could not find Slade he was to ask for Bagley. The officer accordingly went to No. 11, but he could not discover that any one of the name of Slade lived at tbat house, but upon his inquiring for Bagley le found the other prisoner, who turned out to be a Post-office letter-carrier. He was questioud upon the subject of the money-order, and he add anitted that he had sent Embleton to the office to get it cashed, and he accounted for having it in his possession by stating that as he was engaged in delivering his letters on the previous Saturday in Broad-street a stranger came up to him and tapped him on the shoulder and showed him a letter and a money-order, and asked him where it was made payable, and then wished him to get the money for it. He said that he told the man he could not get the money him. self, but he would emnploy some one lse to do so, and he accordingly sent the other prisoner, Embleton, to the moneyorder office, and he added that he was to have taken the money to the person who had given him the order at a publichouse in Broad-street on the following Monday evening.- From further Inquiries that were made it turned out that on the 31st of October, the day on which the letter was reposted in London, the prisoner was engaged in sorting letters at a branch office In Southampton-street, through which any letters addressed to Gulldford.street would have passed In the ordinary course of delivery, and consequently he had an opportunity of stealing theletter If he had been so minded. Mr. PR1rTON, made a very ingeniouis address to the jury on behalf of the prisoner Bagley, and he urged that there was nothing to show thatthe story he told was not the truth, and that some person who had either found or stolen the letter containing the money-order had employed him to get it cashed. He at the same time observed that a postman was a very likely person who would be employed for such a purpose. The other prisoner said that he had merely presented the order at the Post-office, and that he was not aware of there being anything wrong in tho transaction. The jury returned a verdict of Guilty against both prisoners, and Bagley was sentenced to four years' penal servitude, and Embleton to be Imprisoned and kept to hard labour for 18 months. Mark Nicholas Powles, 20, was charged with felony, under a statute passed in the reign of His late Majesty William IV., in having unlawfully entered into a recognrsauce of bail in the name of another party, without the authority of that party. Mx. Sleigh conducted the prosecution on behalf of the Corporation of the city of London; the prisoner was defended by Mr. Metoalfe. It appeared that two persons named Houtmann and Gould were under examination before Mr. Hainmill, the magistrate at Worship-street, upon a charge of uttering forged orders for the delivery of goods, and they were eventually committed to take their trial at this court upon that charge, but the magistrate consented to take ball for their oppearance. The final committal took place on the 18th of July, and on that day the prisoner attended at the policecourt and represented himself to be Thomas Powles, of Portland-terrace, Victoria-park-road, and he entered Into a recognizance in the sum of 401. for the appearance of HIoutmann at the August session of this court. When the session came on Gould surrendered, and was tried and acquitted, but Hloutmnann did not make his appearance, and he has hitherto evaded justice, and the Court ordered his recognizances to be estreated. The usual proceedings were taken to recover the amount from his sureties, and it then turned out that the prisoner had entered into the recognizance at the police-court in the name of his father, and that the latter knew nothing whatever of the transaotion. The prisoner was lost sight of for some time, and he was only discovered a short time back in Holloway Prison, where he was under sentence of imprisonment for felony, and when he was told that he was charged with having personated his father at the Worship-street Policecourt he said it was a bad job. Mr. MErCALFE urged, on behalf of the prisoner, that he was not aware of the serious nature of the act he had committed, and that the probability was that being accidentally at the police-court ho had thoughtlessly offered himself as bail, and that he did so as a joke, and without any idea of the serious consequences that were likely to ensue. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE, in summing up, called the attention of the jury to the terms of the statute under which the Indictment was framed, and observed that with regard to the defence that had been set up on the part of the prisoner, that the proceeding was merely a joke on his part, he must say that t was a very dangerous joke indeed. The object of obtalning a recognizance was to insure the attendance of the person who was under charge to take his trial, and if a man of straw were substituted for one who was in a responsible position, the recognizance became valueless, the Queen, in whose name the recognizance was taken, had no remedy, and it was a complete fraud upon public justice. The jury, after a short deliberation, found the prisoner guilty, but at the same time strongly recommended him to the merciful consideration of the Court on account of his youth. Mr. SLEIGH said he thought It his duty to inform their Lordships that very shortly after the occurrence at the police court the prisoner was tried for an offence of exactly the same description Is that of which the person whose release he had obtained, was accused, and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. The jury upon hearing this statement expressed their desire to retract their recommendation to mercy. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE, in passing sentence upon tho prisoner, said tbat, although his learned counsel had endeavoured to show that his offence was of a trifling character the more they heard of him tended to induce them to come to a very different opinion, particularly when they ascertained that he had entered into a false recognizance to release a prisoner who was charged with uttering forged orders for the delivery of goods on the 18th of July, and on the 4th of August he was himself tried for uttering a forged order for the delivery of silk, and was convicted of that offence. There could be no doubt that he had entered Into a bad course, and had got into viciouE company, and nnder all th circumstances he felt it to be his duty to order him to be kept to bard labour for fifteen months. John Grace Leveridge, 26, was charged with steaUng an order for 311. 2s. 2d., the property of Williamw Oldham Mr. Ribton conducted the prosecution; the prisonervwas defended by Mr. Sleigh. This case occupied the Court for a considerable time, owing to the lne of defence that was adopted, but the facts were in a very small compass. The prosecutor Is a wine merchant, carrying on business in London-street, Fenchurcho street, and the prlsoner had been in his service for nine years, and was employed in a very confidential manner. According to the evidence of the prosecutor, about the 4th of November he gave the prisoner a check for 311. 2s. 2d. to pay the duty on a butt of wine that he had sold to the larl of Leicester, and about the same time he also gave the prisoner a blank check, which he was to have filled up for the sum of 31. for a week's petty cash, bhlt it appeared, that instead of doing so, he inserted the sum of 96/. 2-. 2d. on the check, and obtained that amount from the hankers; and he also cashed the check for 311. 2s. 2d., aid afterwards obtained gold for the notes at the Bank of England, and It did not appear to be denied that the prisoner had appropriated the residue of this money to his own use. The prosecutor was subjected to a very severe cross-examination by Ml r. SLEIGH, a great many of the matters inquired into appearig to be of a private and personal nature. 2he prosecutor admitted that ho had been at times pressed for money to meet his engagements, and that the prisoner had on a few occasions obtained cash for post-dated checks to accommodate him. He denied that he was indebted to the prisoner, and asserted that, on the contrary, there was a considerable amount due to himself from the prisoner. Mr. Baron WATSON interposed duiring the cross-examination, and said he thought the learned counsel was really golng too far, and that he was inquiring into the private affairs of the prosecutor, which had nothing whatever to do with the matter before the Court. Mr. SLEIGH said he was only acting upon his instractions, and he w as compelled to make the inquiries he had done In order to show that there was no foundation for the charge against the prisoner. le was the last person, he said, who would make any investigation Into the private affairsof a prosecutor, or enter into matters that were not relevant to the inquiry; but on the present occasion he had no alterna- tive, as his object was to show that the prosecutor was indebted to the prisoner, and that he had merely repaid himself, The prosecutor was subsequently recalled, and in answer to further questions put to him by Mr. SLEIGH he admitted that In August last he had written a letter to the prisoner, in which he addressed him as "Dear Joh n," and statedthat he was fearful of being arrested, and also that if he could not get a certain oreditor whom he named to come to some terms that it would be better for him to go through the GazeUe. He also said that he had made an offer to compromise the matter, but it 'was only upon conditiorn that tib prl.ongr should plead guilty, and cozment to the accounts being referred to some third party to see what amount was due to him, and upon theEe terms he uniertook to recommend the prisoner to mercy. At the close of the case for the prosecution Mr. SLEIGH made an energetio appeal to the jury on behalf of the priEoner, and said his instractions were that the prosecutor was indebted to him In a considerable amount, and that, beleing he was on the verge of bankruptcy, he took the opportanity of repaying himself. He also said that, with regard to the check for 311. 2s. 2d., the money would have been paid for the duty, hat that the wine was not ready for removaL. A witness connected with the St. Katharine Docks was examined, and he proved that the prisoner had made some inquiries relating to the wine in question, and that it was not ready for delivery on the 5th of Nlovember. Another witness, named Shearman, was also examined, and he proved that he accompanied the prisoner to Mr. Oldham's office on the 10th of November, and that he complained of the prosecntor making charges of forgery and embezlement against him, and requested that he would give him into custody if there was any foundation for such charges. It appeared that an angry altercation took place between the parties upon this occasion, and that, although something was said at one time about the affair being compromised by the 'prosecutor, it was only upon condition that the accounts should be referred to arbitration, and that the prisoner should pay the prosecutor half the amount of money that should be found to be due to him. Several other witnessee were called who gave the prisoner a very good character. Mr. Baron WATSON, In summing up, said that, although a great deal of what he considered to be totally irrelevent matter had been introduced into the inquiry, the question the iury had to decide was a very simple one, namely, whetnrtherisoner was proved to have received this check for31 2s.2(L from his masterand to have afterwardsaproprlated it to his own use. It had been urged on behalf ofthe prisoner that he was merely asserting his right to money that was due to him, but it appeared to him that tbere was no evidence to show that the prosecutor was a' all Indebted to the prisoner, and even if he had been it was his duty to tell them that a clerk had no right to take his master's money to pay anv debt he supposed to be due to him, and that it would be no answer to such a chbrge as the present. The jury would, however, look at all the facts of the case and Say whether the case for the prosecution was made out or not. The jury retiredl, and after being absent about half-anhour they came into court shortly after 6 o'clock, and gave a verdict of Not Guilty. There was another charge against the prisoner of forging the check for 961. 2s. 2d., which Mr. Ribton intimated his Intention to proceed with. NEW COURT. (Before the RxCORDsxR.) John White, 32, gunmaker, was indicted for stealing 51,, the moneys of Thomas Frost. Mr. Platt prosecuted and Mr. Langford defended. The prosecutor, an eiderly countryman, carrying on business as a miller at Ealsted, in Essex, said, that upon the 16th of November he was in Wellington-street, near London-bride, vvhen he asked some one whom he met if he could bll him where a boiler maker was to be found; the man said he would take him to his brother, who followed that trade. The man first asked him if he would have some beer, and the prosecutor assenting, they all went to a public. house, wheretho prisoner and another man joined them; one of the party then said thati he had some money left him, and wvas up in towrn to receive it. A lock was then produced, and the man wvho first apoke to prosecutor offered to bet that it could not be picked. Another one p ressed the prosecutor to bet, hut he refused. He was then taunted about not having any money, upon which he was incautious enough to produce the sum named, which the pror took up and went away with, but was soon after taken custody. Mr. IANGFORD, in a speech of some length, contended that the money had been lost fairly in a bet made by the proseeutor. The jury, howvever, entertaining a different opinion of the transaction, found the prisoner Guilty, and he was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment. TBIRD COURT. (Be ore the CoMIoN SERJEANT.) William Moody, 29, soldier, was indicted for robbery with violence upon Joseph Fleck, and stealing from him a watch and chain. Mr. Gent prosecuted. The prosecutor, a German, living in Pembroke-place, Vauxhall was upon the night of the 30th of October pro. ceeding along Vctoria-street, Westminster, when he was sopped by the prisoner and another man. He was almost immediately knocked down with great violence, and the prisoner fell upon him. Re raised an outcry, and prisoner then got up, and tearing the watch and guard from prosecutor's neck, both men ran off. The police said that hearing the prosecutor they went In that direction, and saw the prisoner running away from the spot. They followed him into Blue Anchor-yard, and took him into custody. Upon being taken into custody he said he had run up that place to escape the observation of a picket which had jast turned out. There being nothing found upon the prisoner at the station the constables went back to the spot where they had apprehended him, and there among some rubbish found the prosecutor's watch and The jury found the prisoner Guilty. An officor of the Guards, to which regiment the prisoner belonged, said he had been specially sent to inform the Court that the prisoner bore a very bad character in the regiment. He had been tried several times when in the Crimea, but never convicted. The COURT sentenced him to four years' penal servitude. Thomas Eastly, 31, soldier, was indioted for stealing a canvass tent, waggon cover, and three blankets, the property of our Lady the Queen. Mr. Bodkin prosecuted, and Mr. Brooke defended. It appeared that a police-constable met the prisoner upon the night of the 30th of October coming from the barracks at Woolwich with a sack upon his shoulder. He (the officer) stopped him, and, opening the sack, found the articles in question, which were quite new, and apparently had been just taken from the stores, and had the Govern. ment mark upon them. Mr. BROOKtE, for the prisoner, urged in mitigation the very high character which he had borne, and the fact that his pension would be lost. The jury found the prisoner Guilty. Mr. BODKNn requested that sentence might be deferred to afford the prisoner an opportunity of giving information to the authorities, as it was evident a system of plunder was now going on. Sentence postponed. Francis Allen, 35, tailor, and James Coward, 22, labourer, were indictod for stealing 520 co 10s of the London Journal, the property of William Mark lark. Mr. Metcalfe and Mr. Poland prosecuted; and Mr. W. Cooper, Mr. J. P. Doyle, and Mr. libton defended. Tne facts have been very recently reported. The prosecutor is the publisher in Warwick-lane, and upon the 24th of October both prisoners had been to his office. As soon as they left a quantity of copies of the above work were missed, and almost directly afterwards traced to the shop of Allen, in Bath-street, Newgate-street. The jury found them both Guilty, and Coward having been before convicted, was sentenced to 18, and Allen to 12 months' imprisonment.
MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Thur8day, Nov. 26. The November General Sessions of tho Peace for the county of MIddlesex commenced this morning at Clerken. well before Mr. BLiss, Q.C., Attorney-General for the Duchy of Lancaster, presidtng for the Assistant-Judge, and a bench of magistrates. There were 53 oases of felony and nine of mlsdemeanonr for triaL Mr. BLISS in his charge to the grand jury observed that the learned Assistant-Judge had, he was glad to say, so far recovered from his late serious and severe illness that there were hopes of his being soon able to resume his duties. Alfred Jones was indicted for stealing the sum of 31V. in the dwelling-house of William Lowmaa. He pleaded ifGulty." Mr. BLiss said he had read the depositions, and from the evldence It appeared that the prisoner, who was a paperhanger by trade, had been employed in that way of business at the prosecautor's house, and while so engaged bad taken advantage ef an opportunity, necessarily afforded him, to steal from one of the rooms a small box in which there were 311. There was a most aggravating circumstance in the case. The prisoner, after emptying the box of the money it contained, placed it in the trunk of one of the servants, to avert susplCon from himself and to throv It upon an innocent individuaL That was a very base and subtle act, for which, however, he had made some atonement, for by pleading guilty he had removed all doubt as to the guilty person. The sentence was that he be kept to hard labour for six calendar months. The prisoner wished the Court to understand that he protested against the assumption that he placed the cashbox In theservant'strunkwith the idea attributed to him. The trun wa emty,andhe pace th bo init, so that it should not be found., Charles Pemberton, 20, was indicted for stealing three Eaws, the property of Henry Fairbank, an engineer in Oldstreet, St. Luke s. The prisoner was A cquitt4 on this charge, and he was then tried for feloniously receiving part of a pump made of gun-metal, weighing 441b., which Stafford Smith, 18, engineer, pleaded guilty to stealing. The latter prisoner was one of the same prosecutor's apprentices, and the cylinder of a pump being missed from the premises inquiries were set on foot, and ultimately It was ascertained that it had been sold by the prisoners, acting together, at a marinestoredealer's, 67, Friar's-mount, Bethnal-green. They got 4d. per pound for it, but the prosecutor said it was worth Sd. even for old metal. The marine storedealer gave it up to the prosecutor the day after It was inquired for. The jury found Pemberton Guilty in this case, and The COURT sentenced him to eight months', and Smith to 'six months' hard labour. Mlr. hletcalfe appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Orrldge for the prlsoner Pemberton. John Frooms, 19, was indicted for stealing six bottles of wine, value 11. lOs., the property of Robert Lowden. Mr, Digby appeared for tie prosecution; Mir. Horry for the prisone'-. The prosecutor was a carrier between London, Southallgreen, and Norwood, and it appeared from his evidence that on the morning of the 25th of October, soon after 12 o'clock, as he was passing the Duke of ;N orthumberland's residence at laleworth, he observed the shadow of two men at the tailboard of his cart, He immediately jumped down, and the men ran away. On examining two wine flats which were packed behind the cart he found that one of them had been broken open and five bottles of port and one of sherry, which a short time before he had seen safe, been taken out. Though he had but a momentaryglance at the men, he gave a d rption of their appearance, the light of the moon being full upon them. A goed deal of circumstantial evidensce weads given to prove the prisoner was one of the parties The jury returned a verdict of Dvot Guilty. Abraham Fawkes, 24, journeyman butcher, was Indicted for feloniously embezzling several sums of money reeolved by him on account of George Sutton, his master, from oug. tomers. He was found guilty and sentenced to six montha' hard Labour. Caleb Smith, 28, and Thomas Herbert, 34, wereo indcted for unlawfully attempting to obtain one sovereign froma William Bostock, with intent to defraud. Wiliam Bostock the poseutor, stated that he was the keeper of the Sir Walterfcott beershop in Brunswick-street, Hackney-road, and on the 31st of October the prisoners came to him and asked if he would purchase any tobacco cheap; he said he would, and Smith showed him about a quarter of a pound as a sample of a quantity-about 501b.- vhich he said he would sell at 2s. per pound, as he had obtained it "on the cross"-leading witness to infer therefrom that it was either atolen by him, or was the proceeds of a robbery committed by some other person. Smith offered him 121b. for a sovereign, or the whole for 31. He agreed to take a 121b. packet, and told them to walt in the bar a short time. He went out and informed two pollce officers, vhom he stationed near Shoreditch church. He then went back home, when the prisoners asked him to lend them a bag to fetch the tobacco, and he arranged to meet them at Shoreditch church. In about half an hour they appeed at the appointed place Herbert Carying the bazg. Witness asked them if they had got the tobacco, to which Smith replied that It was all right, and requested that the money might be handed over before he parted with the tobacco. Witness asked them to step over the way to a tobacconist, but they refused, and asked that they might have the money then and there. On crossingthe way the police took them into custody, and the hag, on being examined, was found to contain a small quanUt,ityof tobacco only, the great bulk of it being sawdust. =The prisoners did not deny the offence, but begged for mlercy en the ground that they had never done wrong before. Th@ jury found them Guilty, and Smith was proved to have been convicted on a former occasion of defrauding detective officers by pretending to be able to give a clue to the parties concerned in the robbery of the Qaeen's plate. Smith was sentenced to three and Herbert to one month's hard labour. (Before Mr. Cxvvsy.) Xugene Riordan, 33, miler, was indicted for stealing half an ounCe of gold, the property of John Bacon. Mr. Taylor prosecuted; Mr. Tindal Atkinson appeared for the risoner. The prosecutor is a gold watchcaso manufacturer, carry. ing on business at No. 5, Charles-street, City-road, and on the 15th of October be sent the sweepings of his shop to a mill in Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell, to be ground, for the purpose of extracting thevaluable metal therefrom. He sent a boy to the mill, named John Castroe, to see the pro. cess of grinding, and while so engaged he saw the prisoner (who was employed to gind the sweepings) repeatedly put something into hls pocket. Upon this he left the place, and went and informned his master of what he had seen. The master Immediately returned to the mill, and charged the prisoner with having stolen some pieces of gold. le de. nied that he had done so, and produced from hts pocket a Piece of copper. The prosecutor peristed in saying that he had some gold upon which he took out of his pocket several grains, and sald that was all; but on a policeman making his appearance he threw some more pieces on the f'oor. These the prosecutor picked up and kept, with the grains the prisoner had before given tohin. When the plceman searched the prisoner he found some pieces of metl pe up in paper in his trousers pocket, and also some grai af gold in his waistcoat pocket. He was then given Into cus tody for having stolen the gold. Mr. TINDAL AT]KmsoN addressed the mury for the prisoner contending that there was no proof of the identity of the pieces of metal as ever having belonged to the prose. cutor, and altogether the case was too loose for the jury to act upon. As there was considerable doubt In it, they were in common justice bound to give the prisoner the benefit of it, and acquit him of this charge. MUr. Cnx.sSY summed up, and The jury found the prisoner Gilty. Sentence was deferred for inquiries to be made as to the c haracter of the Prisoner. William Frost, 27, plane-maker, was indicted for stealiung in the dwelling-house of Edward Cox. The prosecutor resided at No. 3, Pembroke-wharf, Caledonlais-road, and the prisoner was his nephew. He had lived with him ever since he wsua child,but aboutfive weeks before the commission of the robbery he had been forbidden from again entering his house. On Mo3nday, the 9th of November, in consequence of a communication made to him by his wife, he went upstairs and found that a box in his bedroom had been broken open, and 561. in gold and siver had been taken from it. The prisoner knew that he kept his money there. The money was quite safe in tho box on the day previous. Sarah Cox, wife of the prosecutor, said that on the afternoonof the 9th of November, hearing a noise on the stairs, she went out of her room and saw the prisoner coming downstairs with his shoes in his hand. He had no business there. She asked him what he had thus frightenei her for, and he replied, " Oh I aunt, I have enlisted for a soldier, and they are after me," giving that as a reason why he had concealed himself. He then asked if she thought his uncle would give him a job, and she said she did not know. He then said he would go and ask him, but, having put on his shoes, he went out into the street and disappeared. Witness immediately went upstairs, and found that the money was missing from the box. Thomas Muncey, of the Cambridge police, proved taking the prisoner into custody at the Bell and Crown, Cambridge, on the 18th of November. He searched him, and found on his person 181. in gold, ll. 15s. in silver, and other moneys which he refused to give any account of. The prisoner, in his defence, said that Mr. Cox had bor. rowed money from his parents, and on the day in question, after having a quarrel with his aunt, on hif stating that ho wanted some new clothes she had given him the money. hMs. Cox was recalled, and, in answer to a question from Mr. CREASY, said that every word that had been uttered by the prisoner was false. The Jury found the prisoner Guilty. Mr. Cox said that It had been a most painful task to him tobhrng the prisoner there, as he had been more than a fatherto him; but he had been avery bad boy, and on many occasions had given him great cause to complain of his conduct. The officer, Muncey, said that the prisoner went to the Bell and Crown, at Cambridge, in the first style of fashion, and wished to hire a horse; but as Mr. Newman, the inn. beeper, had no horse disengaged, he sent to Mr. Cox, a hvery stable-keeper (who happened to be the brother of the prosecutor) to borrow a horse for the occasion. In a short time afterwards Mr. Cox himself came to the Bell and Crown with It, when he at once discovered that the person who wanted it was his nephew, and, having previously re. celved information from his brother in London of the robbery which had been committed, he at once gave the prisoner Into custody, and he was brought to London. Mr. CREAsY said he would take time to consider what sentence he would pass upon the prisoner, Jobh IRichmond, 60, ropemaker, was andicted for ualawfully attempting to commit the crime of self-murder by Cutting his throat with a knife. He pleaded "Guilty." It appeared that in 1848 the prisoner was tried at the Old Bailey for attempting to murder his wife by cutting her throat, and was sentenced to fifteen years' transportation. In 1855 he was liberated on a ticket of leave, receiving a gratuity, and he went back to his wife and children, and behaved well for some time, but at length he broke into fits of violence towards them, and in the end turned hiB hand against himself. One day he was found lying on a sofa at the house of a brother-in-law with his throat cut. This charge was preferred to restrain him from farther violence. Mr. BLIss, before whom the prisoner was tried, severely admonished him upon the enormity of his conduct, and sentenced him to one months' imprisonment, and to give security for his good behaviour for 12 months.
POLICB. MAYSION-HoUSE.-Jobn Riley was brought before the LORD MAYOR, charge d with the dou!ble offence of feloniously breaklngintotheecounting-houseof Messrs. Henwood and Co., dyers, and stealing some trifilng artioles, and of break. ing into the warehousel of M /\Anthony John Smith, and stealing therein eight pieces of woollen eloth, of the value of The premises of both proseeutors are at 23, Lawrence-lane, Cheapside. Samuel Rowley said,-My wife cleans the offices of Mr. Smith, at 23, Lawrence-lane. Last night, between 7 and half-past, I went there in her absence and tried to unlook the oor, but could not do so. I then forced in the door, immediately upon which the prisoner ran out of the pre. nises, knockod me into the road, and bolted off. I pursued him, and he was captured by M'Naith, constable 77, at the corner of Greaham-street. I afterwards examined the premises, and there found a " jemmy" and the wedge produced. The keys had been left for me, as usual, by the gentleman who occupies the premises. ,W. 'Naith, constable No. 77, said,-About half-past 7 last night I was in Gresham-street, when I heard a cry of "Stop thief !" I secured the prisoner and took him back to Mr. Smith's premises. I found both the street and the passage door open, and the lock of the former bent. I found various pieces of cloth lying upon the floor. I then wenb along the passage and found the door of Messrs. Henwood and Co.'s office open. The lid of the desk had been forcei, and the two pooket-books I produce were lying in the passage. I found the "jemmy" behind Mr. Smith's door, and the three skeleton keys I took from the prisoner's pocket at the station-house. The " jemmy" fits the marks on the door and desk, and one of the skeleton keys opens the door. Mr. E. A. Cufley, clerk to Messrs. Dupr6 and Austin, of Lawrence-lane, said, -Our offices are on the first floor; Mr. Smith has a warehouse underneath. I locked the outer door of the passage a little before 7 last night, and left the keys atRowley's house. Everything was then safe. Mr. A. J. Smith, warehouseman, saidl he looked the do)r of his office about half-past 5, and left, taking the key wllh him. Between 1l and 12 this morning he found the promises in possession of the police. Several pieces of black woollen cloth had been removed from a pile of goods In the warehouse to a place behind the door. The value of the cloth was about 401. The warehouse had been broken open, and the look was bent. The jemmy produced by the constable was not on the premises at the time witness left on the previous night. Mr. Thomas Woodgate, agenb to Messrs. Hen7wood and Co., identified the two pocket-books produced as his propeity, and said that one of them had been taken from his desk, which had been forced open. A great coat belonging to himself had been stolen from the counting-house. John Coe, office boy to the last witness, said he locked up the premises the evening before, leaving everything safe. The prisoner, who declined saying anything in bis defence, was fully committed for trial. GUILflRAL.-Mx. Saunders, the master, and John Angell, the porter of the City of London Umion, at Bow, appeared before Sir F. G. MooN to answer the complaint of William Donald Thompson, for refusing to admit and lodge him in obedience to a written order from the relieving. officer. The complainant eaid,-On Saturday Last I received an order from the relieving-officer for admission to the uniou as a casual pauper, and on presenting tbat order at the union at Bow, ,between 6 and 7 o'clock, I was aditted anc about me, but he took from me two bundles of papers stating at the same timo that be was authorized to do so b the Poor Law Board. Sir F. G. MOON.-Is it customary to search paupers, and take their private papers from thorn ? The master said the papers taken from Thompson were of an improper tendency, and as suah they were taken from him according to the regulations of the Poor Law Board Those papers were brought in for the purpose of creating insubordination. Complain- t.-It remains to be shown that my papers were of that tendency. I demanded them back, and I refused to go into the ward without them, and they were consequent, y restored to me. I then requested my sppr but it was insiste that I should takesa bath befyore Iad any=reliefGIn the shape of food. I dhinot refuse the bath, Sir . G MON.~hlthe'raciceto give them a bath directly paupers are admitted,and tbefore giving them The Mater.-It all depends upon the time of their application for admieseon. Complilnant.-I sid I was hungry and starving ; but I did not get my supper,although others who arrived before me bad had theirs ond It was their turn to take a bath before mine. I ca neither supp eyror batb, for I tonot sleep in the union that night. It was a matter of coercion ordering me into the bath before supper, so that they might take my papers away from me again. The porter sait I stouia not have any sup 1r and then took mre by the collar and shook sue and kl7ked me with his knee, but not to huabmne I admit ; but it was very unpleasant. Sir F. G. MOON,-EYo consdered It, I suppose, an act of indgnIty ? ComPisinant.-Certinly, Sir. There were two other perons present, but being a poor man, and not knowing their names I have not been able to procure their attendance, I was put out into the road, and this is the second or third time I have been served so. On the list oceasion I was wheelod out in a barrow. I was destitute and without home or friends. Sir F. G. Moohs .b Dd yout examine these papers when you took them away from the complainant to ascertain if they had sn improper tendenvcy? The Porter.-I could see what they were, and I took, a list of them, which I gave ton the superintendent of the laborar-yard. Sir F. G. MOON.-so it usual to tun a man out against his wi directly after he has been admitted' The Master.-If he demand his descharge we always act upon it immediately. Sir F. G. MOO1,- Event thxough he may afterwards wis to remain in the hou- I The Master.-Yes. Sir; hbt we know the character of this man so we] He has been the maost refractoy pauper during the lat foulr years that we have ever ad to deal with. Sir F. G. MoON.-But, knowingihm so well, why did -you not let him have hIs supper when became In hungry, in. staudl i a of Initntpnhis takng ae bath norsfeen? TheMaster. -He o lis the mosttroublesoe man in the union. He has been committed at pisoen 21 times for inp su rdi na tion a yth in the m union, and Mr. Ya at the Thames Polie-court knw r.-T hie so arel that he wallenot even listen Con a lndnant.-pee you have given him to underMichael Brennan, the 'superintendent of the labour-yard. -Whern the complainant was admitted and searched he ad we were atlo b- set of thieres, and threw himself on the floor. I raised him up and the porter handed me his papor I took the com plainant to the receiving-room hand gv him his papers agdin.I requested hinm to take his fth and have his coot changed, but he insited upon his dsange, amnsid he would have his supper before the bathl. he porter then told him he must comply with the reguhtions or leave the house, upon which he said, "I wll not take the bath ; I demand my discharge." The porter then obtained the discharge ; but the complainant refnsed to go, and the porter therefore took him gently by the arm and led him out of the house. We mnake no difference between the complainant and the other paupemrs Sir F. of. Mooa.-I have looked at some of these papers, and I cannot find anything In them of an impropeIr tendency. The Master.-These are not the samce paperswhich were taken from him. Complainant.-I pledge yotu my oath, Sir, they are the ldentfarl papers. The Master.-The omplainant hbas fre untly road aloud papers to the other pauper, and indsced them to put their names to petitions which he has forwarded to the Poor Law Comamisioner the effect of which has been to render the paupers disatied, and to create great deal of insubordination. Sir F. G. Mood. -I am sdrongly impressed that the master ought to exercise his own judgment with regard to the management of paupers underhis control, for al paupers cannot be treated alfle. I think the complaiant's request for his supper was not an unreasonable one, for if he came In hungry nd at a proper hour the relief he applied for should have been afforded him. He seems to me to have been a respectable man, and having seen better days, ad being ofwanactive tur of mind, hewap to have kE.Pta diary of his rfe, and unless th Is objectionable I see o improper tendency in the paDers which he compilins were takenfromhim. Iwis toa with justice toall, but the poor man is especially entitled to mny protection, and I think it was rather harsh on the part f the mate toe ra efuethin comsqlneo htld go3gard.Sels rEfuse thet corn lanant hds supper and dischtag himt wthout relief. S therefore hope, as thismanisto ma the union his home, that he will be troated withgproprietyt but, on the other hand, If he misconducts himself, and Is brought oeforo mne, I wil deal with him severely. The summ ons was then dismissed. BOWu STpea r.-Ellzsbith Ball, a woman of about 30 years of age, was brought before Mr. sobey, charged with haying ohtained a situation as laundrymaid in the servic of Lady Malmesbury by maeans of a false character. The prosecution was conducted by Mr. Hooper, his Lord. Josephine Sugneux, maid to the Countess of Malmes2 bury, saed,-In cv Timao of the 13th inst. I saw an advertisement for a situation as laundrymaid, and, as her ladhip wanted one, I wrote to the address stated-" E.B., 56, Market-street, Paddsngton." I lreply to that letter the prisoner came to LordlMalmesbry's house, in Whitehal.U gardens, the following day. She said she had been with the Hon. Mrs. Arn del for nearly two years, htut that she i bad left In consequence of that lady going abroad. She also said that Mr lBrighton would answer an estion about her. She gaveothe address-Mrs.Brighton, Ainsey Vicarage, H ante She said her own name was Elizabeth Ball. Last Malmesbury sworn.-In consequence of what the latwtess stted to me Iwrote to Mfrs. Brfghten at the address sated, to the effect that, having heard that Mrs. Arondel was out of England, and that she (Mrs. Brighton) could speak respecting the character of Elizaboth Ball, I wished to know if she was honest, sober, and hardworking. Insreplyreeivedthe letter produced, recommending EaizabethB r a as possessed of thoe qualifications, aind in every way fitteld for the situation of laundrymafd. It is dated from the Great Westem Hotel. Joseprine Sugneu reca dyed.-On Saturday, the 21st insth , the prisoner caled again and inquired if any answer had been received fromshes. Brighton. I said there had, and as mtwas satibactory I shouldwhireher asl aundrymeaid on behalf of Lady Malmesbury. She came the following day and entered Lady Malmesburys service. Lady Maltesburyfurther stated that she afterwards received a second letter In the same handvwrting as that gii ng a character to the prisoner. Her ladyship produced thi second letter, which cautioned her against ElizabetheBall, and promised that if her ladyship would call on the writer, a Mn. Praden, the latter would give her a true Account of the history of that person. As, however, the letter contained no addres, it was Impossible to sot 3neephng Pent butleforward to Lord Mattebrstatoed that on Saturdayevening hn e made inquirisat teGreat Western inspector Whicher, of the detective force.-I saw the prisoner on Monday last at her ladyship's residence in Whitehall.gardens. I told her I was an officer of plce, and wished to ask her some questions respecting hero lrlaeter. I said "in whose service did you live last?d" She said " With the Hon, Mrs. Arundel, at Houghton, in Hampshire." She said she was there about two years, and lef t about three months back. I asked why she left; and she sahid in consequence of Mrs. Arundel going abroad. I said I had reaon to doubt that statement, and she said it was true. I asked her who Mrm. Brighton was, and she said the wife of the curate of llumsey. She said that when she was with Mrs. Arundel Mr. Brighton was curate of Houghton, and he went fromn there to Rnmsey. I thent saw hler ladyship, and about ten minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner again. She then said Mrs. Brighton had not written the character, but it was true that she had lived with Mrs. Arundel, as she had stated, and on leaving Mrs. Arundel she had received a character, which she had lost out of her pocket about a month ago. After she had been at Lady Malmesbury's she had got a little girl in a shop at Paddington to wvrite to thepostmaster at Rutmsey for her ladyship's letter to Mrs. Brighton, reouesting him to forward it to her at the post-office at Paddington. She didl not say what reason sheo gave the postmaster, but she said that he did forward it as directed. She rAPAVAAIf.-A 1-- 1 - Mrs. Brgho usu( not live at tcumsey,- but at a place called Timisbuy, about four miles from Rumsey. There is a Mr. righton, a clergyman, at Timsbury, but Mr. Moore is the clergyman at Rumsey. She said the character which her ladyship received was written by a woman named P,andall, whom she met by accident in the street on Friday. She said she asked Mrs. Randall to do it for her, and gave her 2s. for It. She said she did not know where Mrs. Randall lived, but she had formerly lived in the same house with her the prisoner) in Market-street, Paddington. She said she gerself coald neither read nor wrlte. I have since ascertained that her last situation was In the service of Sir George Carroll, and that she left about six weeks back, having been there three months. Lady Ca-rroll received a character with her which was believed to be false. Mr. HENRY said, it would be Important to ascertain whether the prisoner really lived with Mrs. Arundel. Prisoner.-That is perfectly true. Mr. HEYRY.-It appears you have had no situation since you left Sir George Carroll's. Whoever wrote that letter for you to Lady Malmesbury wrote to her again to be on her guard, which is the cause of your being placed in that dock. She has at all events played you very false. I think It very possible that she Is worse thau you in the matter. The prisoner said, she would at once statethe residence of the other woman if she knew it. Mr. HERuY said, it was a very gross frand and a very ingenious one, and unless she could explain It he should inflict e uU ponalty, She must remember that if she bore the whole guilt she must bear the whole punishment. The ,risoner insisted that her statements were true. A Mr. xNsry.-xf you were really in the service of Mrs. Arundel, lerwvhy did you write to the postmaster to send back Prisoner.-Because Mrs.Arundel had given me one charaer, a Ithought she would not give me a second one. A gret many lad_es object to do so. Mr. HXRY,-I suppose this Mfrs. Randall thought you did not give her enough for what she had done, and that is why hy urnd aaint yu, t al eent,lse has oertanlY played sou wery fable. After explaining to the prisoner that she wa iable to a penalty of 201., or three months' imprisonment, Mr. Henri adjourned the case for further investigation. nxREONZ.Goore, Edward Wilmot, a glazier, living in Queenustreet, Chelses was ch-rged before Ar. Loxo, on remand, with having uttered a for-ged check to Mr. Henry Jennings, ladlord of the Royal 8axonpublichouse, Alfredread, Harrow-roid. From the evidenace adduced an the present and former occasion It appered that ont the 18th inst. the prisoner went to the house and represented to proseoutor that he wanted a littLe money for an immediate purps, and pro. dnoed a check purporting to be drawn by William Coian Princes-street, Leioester.square, and prybea tebnco Messrs. Seale, Lowe, anado., M aersquare e (prosecutor) knowing the priloner and Cogan gave him (the former) cash, as it was after banking hours, believing at the time that all was right, nd upon the check being presented on the following morning payment thereof was refused, the answer given being "no acoount." Prose. cutor snubequently ascertaned that the check was a forgery, and in consequence thereof he colmmauicated with the ,and the prisoner was taen into custody by Sergeant =e,ac ative offiieer, 210. 8ome additional. psrtlculas were given, and the prisoner, whose defence wvas that he had no knowvledge of the check being a forged one, was committed for triaL. WoRSBp-sTEE=.-Thoe magistrates have recelved a check for a guinea, for the poorbox, from " G. M. H."
TIM INDIAf CASTE DniusroN.-" That man vhom you see lying there is a Brahclin of the highest caste, ye' I have eeen him and other Brahlmins now in my regiment bearing upon their shoulders tLe remains of an officer to the grave. Of course you are aware that to do a, thing of that Idnd-to touch the corpse of an unbeliever--yolyes a loss of caste."-" Yes." " Wel, Sir, these fellows brav'd the opion and the taunts of every tlindoo in the coipntt7i In order to pay respect to the memory of those officers whose dangers and privations they had cheerfully shared. Yoa are aware, perhaps, that at last the Government found it necessary to issue a general order to the efiect that any Sepoy of any other regiment who Insulted the men of this regiment by telling them they had lost their caste would be severely punished and dismissed the service9 Such was the case, Sir; and many courts-martial were held in various stations for the trial of offenders against this order, and many Hindoo Sepoys and Mussulman native oZcers were very severely dealt with. And the thing was put down, Sir nnd nowadays there is nothing more common than for the Eindoo Sepoys In all the regiments to ask pormission to carry the remains of a popular officer to the grave. Indeed, ladles ren often thus honoured and chIldren. They seem to have agreed among themselves that this does not involve a loss of caste-so much for caste, if It can be got over by an understanding among themselves! Caste I More than four-fifths of what they talk about it is pure nonsense and falsehood, as any straightforward native will confidentially confess to you. I don't mean to say that some undoos are not very stict. Many, indeed, are so. But I mean to say that a very smalU proportion live in accordance with the Shasters, a4d that when they cry out if we do so and so we shall ldo caste,' it is nothing more than a rotten pretext for escaping some duty, or for refusing to obey a distasteful order.-pc es Houlsehold Words."

TwE FAT11RlB OF TIn CHtlIRCH OF SCOTLsxn..-.. Tho Rev. Dr. Duncan Macfarlan, Principal of the! University of Glasgow, Ernd minister of the High: Church ded on Wednesday morning at his residence in the College, Glasgow. He was in the 89th year of his age. and had been for the last 10 years the oldest clergyman in the church of Scotland, for he was within three months of completing the 67th year of his ministry as an ordainec clergyman of the national church. He commenced his stu. dies at Glasgow College in the session of 1787, when the city had only a population of abont 42,000, a ninth part of its present amount. In 1792 he was appointed by the Duka of Montrose as successor of his father in the parlsh of Drymen, on the shores of Loch Lomaond. In 1S23 he wa promoted to the office of Principal of Glasgow University, and minister of the Cathedral or High Church of Glasgow which living, the most valuable in the gift of any Scottis patron, he held till his death. He took a prominent part in church politics, belonging to what is kno n as tho a "modeat party."e In 1819 he was elcogteth to tihe high honour of being moderator or wresadenc of the General Assembly of the Church of Sgoteatn, and ie 1843, the year of the disruption of the Chtarch of Soot. lad, he was r ain elected to the moderato's chair, being almost the only Instance in the history of tIhe cihur tIs which this honour has been twice hel by oese indavidath Durinig Principal Macfarlan's lengthened career he has nearly survved two gienertions of the mainisters of the church.

IORD ASHRA1fTESBURY AND THE INDIAN MUTINY. Last night, betvween 10 and Ii o'clock, the Earl of Shaftesbury addressed a very spirited speech to a large pub lie meeting assembled in Crosby-hall, Bishopsgate.street, at which he presided as Chairman, on the present position of affairs in India and the future prospects, duties, and responsibilities of the Brltish rule in that country. In the early ,part of the evening the Rev. F. F. Statham had delivered an extremely interesting lecture, the subject of which was "Our Indian Empire," illustrated by a fine series of models, pictorial representations, and specimens kindly lent for the occasion by the directors of the East India Company; and at its conclusion, The Earl of Sur.mrEsnuRy took occasion, in proposing a vote of thanks to the rev. gentleman, on whose performance he passed a well-deservcd eulogium, to go into the general question of the Indian mutiny. After a few preliminary observations he said,-There has not been in the whole history of Great Britain a crisis more important or more pregnant with future events of the highest order to the interests of mankind at large, if duly received and duly managed, than that which has occurred in Indla within the last few months of tbe current year. If we could sever the unutterable atrocities that have occurred from the event itself I do not hesitate to say that I myself should rejoice, and I would call on every one connected -with the British name to rejoice from the bottom of his soul that that fearfal mutiny took place, because, if rightly managed, it wiUl bring with it the most manifest results, not only to this empire, but to the geat interests of the people of every other part of the whole habitable globe. (Cheers.) You Englishmen have, indeed, great reason to be proud of the nation to which you beIong, but let that pride be of a humble and of a humiliating character. You may well rejoice, I re',eat that you belong to such a nation; but reioice still more that it had pleased God to givesuch a character and disposition to the people of this country that In a cnrsis of such a terrible nature He has produced in that vastregion of India such menand suchwomen,who, although taken by surprise by this fearful catastrophe-having been living in the greatest security-never dreaming, I will not say of bocoming the victims of such atrocities, but that anything like hostile feelings were harboared towards them by the bative soldiery-many of them in the dead of night, others without a moment's preparation, assailed in a manner the most fearful to contemplate-I say, we have reason to be proud that under all these horrible circumstances there has not been found, so far as we know, one of the European race in that vast territory who was wanting to the great and unprecedented emergency,-not one who for an Instant hesitated what to do, not one who would degrade the name of Britain by the display of a miserable cowardice, not one who did not say,come what may, I wiiU put my trust in God; I will stand up for the honour of my country and for the maintenance of the religion I profess. (Loud cheers.) The horrors that were perpetrated and endured exceed all power of imagination as they exceed all power of descrlption, and many of them are of such a character that it Is said they cannot be recorded. I have said all along, and I say now, that there has been a very undue reserve on this part of the subject. Many of the atrocities have been revealed to us, but a vast number have been suppressed. I repeat, there has been a very undue reserve. Thepeople ought to know what has been done and what has been endured, and that not with the view of stimulating angry feelings, or what has been called vengeance-God forbid that revenge should prevail in any man's heart (hear, hoar)-but that you may kcnow exactly what is the character of the people wit1 whom you have to deal, what is the *character of that religon, and what is the nature of those iustitutions that have fostered such a race, and have given the conception and the development to acts unparalleled in the whole history of mankind. (Cheers.) I know there must be reserve on such subjeets, because the indecency of the details wjuld be such that you could not commit them to writing or printing and expose them to the perusal of the public; but there are many atrocities that have not bean stated in all their details, and much of that detail can be given without trespassing too closely on the limits of impropriety or danger. It is only this very day that I have seen a copy of a letter written and sent to England by an officer of rank who was one of the first that entered Cawnpore a few hours, or, perhaps, only one hour, after the perpetration of the frightful massacre which was enacted there; and, think of the description he gives, and what was seen by the whole soldiery, and you will not wonder at the exasperation that was felt by every man among them who boro the European name. On arriving at Cawnpore he states-and he can scarcely permit himself to write the sad story-that, to his unutterable horror and dismay, he saw a number of European women stripped stark naked, lying on their backs, fastened by the arms and legs, and there many of them had been lying four and fire days exposed to a burning sun; others had been more recently laid down; others again had been actually hacked to pieces, and, so recently, that the blood -which streamed from their mangled bodies was still warm He found children of 10, 12, 13, and 14 years of age treated In the same horrible manner at the corners of the streets and in all parts of the town, attended by every circumstance of insult, themostawful and the most degrading, the most horrible and frightful to the conception, and the most revolting to the dignity and feelings of civilized men. Cawnpore was only a sample of what was perpetrated in various parts of that vast region, and that with a refinement of cruelty never before heard of. Women and children have been massacred before, but I don't believe there is any instance on record where children have been reserved in cold blood to be most cruelly and anatomically tortured in tho presence of their horrified parents before being finally put to dKath (Sensation.) Can you wonder, where such areligion prevails as that which has been described to-night by my rev. .riend, that the people should prove worthy of their tuition when the opportunity occurs of developing its fruits ? The character of the Hindoo religion is to deify every passlon, every propensity, every maoral sin, and every physical abomination; but I say you have great reason to rejoice that in this emergency, and amid al! its frightful crimes and atrocities, Providence has raised up for you a class of men that will hereafter stand on a level with the best and greatest In the world's history. In the records which have Foen placed before you this very day you may see the merciful finger of Providence providing for us in the hour of necessity. It has pleased God to remove Nicholson and Neill-great and noble men (cheers)-from the scene of their exploits and their victories; but it has also pleased Him to raise up to take their places a man equal to the best of them-Colonel Greathed. You will see that he has performed an action that for brilliancy is not to be equalled in the whole milltary annals of India itself, brilliant as they are. (Cheers.) Again, what name can stand hereafter with that of Havelock ? (Loud cheers.) Look, too, at Wilson, Outram, Eyre, and Chamberlain, and look also at the brother of that great uan who died at Lucknow-Sir Henry Lawrence. (Cheers ) I trust you will never forget those names-you who aro advanced in years, or you who are young; I trust the country will never forget those names, and I trust there will be no lack or delay on the part of the country In awarding them the highest honours which It is In tho power of the Queen to bestow or in the gratltude of the nation to dictate. (Cheers.) See what great events are before you, and see what a mighty field is open to your energles. There never was such a field offere 1 to any nation, never such an opportunity afforded for the display of principle, zeal, and patriotism-for everythingr in a word, that can engage the human heart or employ the human intellect. (Cheers.) I trust the whole country will appreciate the opening which is now before it. There are eat oponings offered for commeroial enterprise of every escrlption; but the greatest opening of all to which this country is called above every other Is to repay the wrongs that she has received at the hands of the people of India, -who have endeavoured to exterminate us, by conferring on the natives the greatest benefits which it is in her power to bestow-namely, by disseminating among them the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ. It Is for us to hold that country for this purpose, and this purpose only, that, although we may look to the enjoyment of the temporal advantages which arise from the possession of such an empire, the great end for wvhlch it has been given us, and for which we receive it, is that the name of Christ be there made known, and that those vast milions be exalted in the social scale, in freedom of thought and action, and in freedom of religion, to the same position as ourselves, and that of the best and most enlightened nations in the world. That is our duty; in that sense we must now iiundertake the government of India ; with that view we must now shape our policy, and all our hopes and all cur fears. Let us feel our responsibility, not only as a nation, but as individuals, in reference to the great work now before us, each man in his day and generation doing what he can to carry it forward and onward to its ful development, remembaring the great injunction of our Lord, who said, " Occupy till I come." (Loud cheers.) The vote of thanks to Mr. Statham. was then put and carried rwith acclamation, and the proceedings terminated shortly before I Io'clock.

The three Siamese Ambassadors arrived yesterday afterloon on a visit to Hea MaJestY-viz., Phya Montili Sui WofPgse, the first, Chan MCnl Sarbbedh Bhadty, the econd, and the thirdl, Cha Muan Moudir Bidacks.

MISSIONS IN INDIA. A meeting was heldc yesterday at Willis's-rooms to pr. * mote the extension aud enlargement of the missions of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in India. The Archbishop of Canterbury took the chair at 2 o'clock. Among those present on the platform were-the Bishop of London, the Bishop of Oxford, the Bishop of Moray and Ross, the Bishop of Jamaica, the Bishop of Xova Scotia, the Bishop of Montreal, the Bishop of Huron, Sir W. P. Wood, Mr. Palk, M.P. The room was completely crowded, and a great number of persons were unable to obtain almission. The Rector of St. James's having opened the proceedings wlith a prayer, The Archbishop of CANTERBURY Eaid,-It is highly satisfactory to me to find myself relieved on the present occasion from the duty whioh usually devolves upon one plaecd in my position, of entering into the circumstances which have called us together. The disasters which have taken place in India are so deeply engraven on the minds, I:. am sure, of every inhabitant of thie country that a very! slight allusion to bhem would be sufficient in opening the business of the day, but even that duty is spared me, for the secretary has prepared a statement which wil convey 1 all the information that is (requisite. That statemernt will' be followed by resolutions which I hope will meet with the assent and the cordial support of all present. The duty whfch we hope to fulfil {ully deserves the support of adl Christian men, being nothing less than the attempt to propagate the Gospel with greater vigour and with more success throughout the vast peninsula of India. The Rev. A. HAWVINS, secretary to the Soeiety for the Propagation of the Gospel, then read the following report:- - The fierce Etorm which has recently swept over Northem India has Uallen heavily upon the missons of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Two ot the prindipalmiesions-namely, Delhi and Cawnpore-have been wholly swept away, and! in a third-uamely, Saugor-mlasionary operations are neoessarily suspended, in eonsequence of the disturbed state of the surrounding countly. nut not ony have two important mision stationa been violently overthTowu, but the clergymen and catechlete attached to thom have I perished in the Indiscriminate maesacre of the Europeaus. " At Delhi. the Rev. A. B. Hubbard, AI.A., of Caius College. Cambridge, one of the origbial missionaries who went to establish the mlssuon In 1854, Mr. Daniel CorrIs Sandys. and Mr. Louis Henry Koch, of Bishop's College, catechists and candidates for holy ordera, have been foully murdered. I"IAt Cawnpore. the R8ev. W. H. Haycoek and the W-Te. H. B. Cockey. formerly a student of BishbO's Collseg, ' whobhad been dilgently and patiently labouring in their Divine Master's rervice, one for four, the other for t7o yesrs, have met a like bloody death. "Thoishasit pleased th AtmIshty tOo sal a.y. by a sudden and awful summons, five of Eis rervants whUle dedicating the first-frlts of their youth and strength to His glory. "h s iociety, humbly rubmittiug itzelf to thin mysteric us visltation, and with a deep acknowledgment of pust emissions audshort comings desires to addresa ltselt now inu earnest to the great work, hithert sEo feebly prosecuted, of the evangelimtlon of heathen India. W- Whatever may be the causes which have led to the late calamitous mutiny In the Bsagsl army, the rcciety has obeerved with ratisftcUon thatI the Idea or 'fconnecting it with the, proceedings of the wissIonarIes ths been allhinbt universally abandoned. The moss inveterate prejudice on this subject bas been dissipated by the iresi4tible evidence of facts. for It Is well known that while the province of Dude, the very focus and hotbzd of rebellion, has not within It a saigle missionary, the provinces of Tanjore and Tinnevelts where there are above Z0O native Christian congregatons, and upwards ot 50,000 ceonvrl5, have remaiuedl throughout perfectly quiet and undisturbed. .Again, in the native Bengal army, which Elas been the clief instrIment of the recent most fearful atrocities, preaebing is absolutely forbidden, and there probably was not at the tume of tte outbreak a single Ohbr'isn to be foud In lt ranky. *- So far, therefore, from there being any ground for apprehending danger to the Peace and stability of our Indian empire from the Drogress of Cbristianity, it may be confideltly maintained that the ditlu. sion of Chrintian truth and Christian prici-ples L-ot only affords the best means of promoting the moral end socl,l amelloration of the people, hat presents the only effectual seemity for the maintenance of British supremacy iu India. "That oar recent disasters, sad and humiliating as they ara, wiUl tend ultimately to the furtherance of the gospel, the society is folly assured; and now la the time to press forward wib. increased earnestness in this holy meuse. Thxe soCiety, therefore, has resolved, Go4 baing Its helper, and so far as the means placed at its disposal shai allow, to adopt and carry out the f ollowing measures :- "1. o dubl 1stlestl he nmbe ofthe society's European misionariies in India, aend tohptromuotebey very avaitslble meau s the education, training, and ordination of the iore advAnoed native conyenta for the work of the Christian ministry amocig their own ooautrymen. 2.

To presasgain upon tho attention of the Indian Government I the urgent necessity ot a subdivision of the en.r-nouns dioceses of Calcutta and Madras, and espeoialy to insist nouon thIs desIrablenes of establsebthg a bfibopric for the Punjab, an6ther for the NortlhWee&oM Provinces, and a third fX r the province of Tinanroey." The rev. gentleman announced that the subscriptions which had hcen received ip to the present time amounted to 2,9C01,, being 1,(9001. for India generally, 8001. for the ! restoration of the Delhi mission, and 2001. for the Cawnpore Memorial Charob. The Bishop of LONcDON.-My Lord Archbishop,-I con. fess it is with perfect truth I can say that I most unwillingly present myself on the present occasion. I almost thought it a privilege that on the day of humiliation, appointed throughout the whole country on account of the disasters in India, I was not called upon by circumstances to express myself on these melancholy evente. When we think of what they are, how manifestly they have been God's deallngs with us, how little we know of what has been their-real cause, how little we know even yet of what will be their issae, it seems to me almost presumptuous to speak wlth that sort of fluency with wnich some have spoken of the causes and consequences of these great and unparalleled disas. ters. No text has presented Itself to niy imsind as suitable to be used in connexion with these events except this, "I was dumb and opened not my moath, for it was Thy doing." To look back upon the past history of India and to find fault with the conduct of its ialers durling the I la,t 100 years does not seem to me to be much of our Choistian duty at the present moment. It is always a melancholy sign when in a disturbed state of any society or commonwealth men begin rather to rail against each other as to what has been the cause of the misfortune than to buckle themselves manfnUy to the work of meeting it in the form in which it has come upon them. (Hear, hear.) In the consideration of the events transpiring in India perhaps nothing has been more painful than that tendency which seemed to show itself, both here and there, to heap abuse upon those who have been intrusted with the most difficult-I might almost say overwhelming-task of meeting this unexpected emergency, The rulers of India in past times have had to deal with problams such as the governors of this world never had committed to them before. We are too apt to talk as if it had been in their power to Christianize at once that vast continent; but lCO years is only a shoit time in the history even of the human raeo, and far more is it a short time in the development of the purposes of Elim with whom a thousand years are but as ore day and one day but rs a thousand years. Our rulers in India have had to take possession of that vast continent, not with an overwhelming army, by which they could have spread the civilization of their own country as it were almost by force, but with the help of its own inhabitants, and have always been placed in the peculiar and extraordinary position of governing a heathen land through the heathens themselves, It is perfectly true that a great mistake has been committed In the government of India (hear, hear); but that mistake has been discovered by the events which have happened within the Last few months, and it is far bettor that we should all unite in rectifying it than that we should trouble ourselves more than Is absolutely necessary in considering whose fault it is that things have come to the present pass, (Hear, hear.) Even that consideration would have made me most unwilling to express my sentiments to-day; but far more unwilling must I feel when I remember how little I, for one, at least, know of the subject which has brought us together. I am not aware that my ignorance on that subject is greater than that of most persons, hbut still I am convinced that it is profound, and I would have been glad indeed if we could on the present occasion have had the benefit of the advice and assistance of some person who had been himself onthe spot, who had watched the events which have been occurring in India during the past year, and to whom all the affairs of that vast continent are familiar as to ourselves are familiar the events going on in onr own cities and dioceses. It is, however, my duty to bring this subject before you, and in doing so I am very glad that the resolutions placed in my hands are of such a nature that I can give them, in common I believe with every one in this room,, I may almost sayiwith every man in this metropolis, my hearty ascent. You have heard from the secretary that this Society for the Propagation of the Gospel has its own distinctive views as to the best mode of advancing Christianity in India, yet the resolutions which are to be submitted to you to-day do not embody any peculiar views upon that subject. An impression has got abroad that this meeting has been convened for the purPose of raising a steti- uuny In lavour ox tno erecuton ot some eight new b[shoprics in India. It is the undoubted opinion of this society that such bishoprics, some of them at least, ought to be ereeted ; but it is not the intention of the committee in caUling you to. gether to requcst you to pledge yourselves upon that particuar point. The resolutions are such as I believe every man, whether he be a member of the church of England, or w-hether he be not, will be ready, if ho be a Christian, to assent to in the present state of affairs in Ind;.a. (Hear, hear.) That which I have to submit to you is as foUlows*- " That the chureh of England Is cilJet, b; the lato calamitous events in IDdia, to adosit more energetic rieasore, for the dUffasaon of the G.3zpel In thatb enighted l,nd; and th.t this meeting ,vi give its hearty sup or' to the Society for the 1'ropagation oE the Gospel in itc efforts to strongtheu aud extend itz mieiiorna among the Hindoow and 1,ahomnedans." As to the first part of thatresolution,there is no man calling hiniself a Christian in this country who will not at once assent to it, and my belief is that if the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was thoroughly and fairly understood there would almost as few be found to dissent from the second part. (Hear, hear.) The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel is intimately connected with the ehurch to which we belong. It professes to belong to no narrow or exclusive section of that church. (Cheers.) In all that it brings before you it speaks with the same width of Christian charity with which the church of England itself speaks. (Cheers.) AninstanceIcould quotetoyou,ifthematter were misunderstood, which has occurred within the last few days. Everyone who has looked at the newspapers has seen something as to a proposed Memorial Churoh at Cawnpore, and a feeung has somehow got abroad that this is a matter In which there is sonme party feeling, although those engaged in it desire only with one heart and one mind to expres their admsration of the heroism of those who died as Chrstians in that awful emergency, to thanlk God that the evi ldid not sPread further, and to pray to Him that tha6t scene of diabolical wickedsses may soon become a seat of Christian truth. (Cheer.) How the idea arose that there was an'ything of party connected with this maatter I cannot say, hut no sooner was the proposition made to the Society for' the Propagation of the Gosnel to alter the terms on which it usallay proceeds in the founsidation of a Christian churcoh in any district, in order to dispel the feelin.g which had arisen, than it immie- diately assented to it, and a resolution has within the lasb few days been adopted to meet the difficulty which, however unreasonably, had occurred to the minds of some who had heard the erroneous reports as to the Memorial Church at Cawnpore. A negotiation was at the same time opened with that other great socfety which is supposed to represent a somewhat different seotion of the church of England, in order that there should not be the shadow of a doubt as to the real Christian, and, in the highest sense, catholic spirit in which those connected with this society intended to undertake that great work. (Cheers.) I therefore think I am eatitled to say that If thIn society were rightly and thoroughly understood there would be few persons who would for a moment refuse their assent to the second par' of the resolution as well as to the first,-" and that this meeting wil give its hearty support to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in its efforts to strengthen and extend its missions among the Hindoos aud i Mlahomedans," I trust that the solemn events which have induced us to unite together in this matter of the Cawnpore M:emorial Church may remind us on othee oc¢asions also that when men go forth to preach the gospel to the heathen they ought to forget those foolish party distinctions wh ch make them atand asunder from each other at home. (Hear, hear.) The first part of the resolution says that "the church of England is called, by the late calamitous events in India, to adopt more energetic measures for the diffusion of the Gospel in that benighted land." Let me say one word as to the full and comprehensive meaning of that appellation "the church of England." It means not the clergy, nor those distinctly sworn to missionary effort alone, but the laity as well as the clergy- the whole church, not a part of it. AlU are bound to exert thermselves in this work, and not only to exert themselves in the obvious way of subscribing to promote missionary effort, but to undertake that vast amoant of mifssonary work which may be done by those who never considezthemselves as missionaries. What is the general sentiment as to the way In which India is hereafter to be administered? It is a very common impression that we must have in that country henceforward a far larger force of European soldiers than we have ever had before; and let me ask this question,-If that be a recognized necessity, is it not our beuonden duty to see that the soldiers whom we send forth shall be specimens of what Christian soldiers ought to be in their lives, and that in the provision which we make for their instruection and for their religious ministration no one shall be able to say that we sent them forth into a heathen country as if they were themselves heathens? (Cheers.) Let us ever endeavour to impress this upon those over whom we have any influence, that the soldiers who are henceforward to go forth to take their partin maintainiugEnglish supremacy in India shall go forth as Christian soldiers, aud that nothing but the weakness of human nature shall pre. vent them from exhibiting what Christians ought to be when they live in the midst of heathens. How hard has been the lot of our common soldiers inbygonetimes inlndia, how few opportunities have they had of having their minds drawn aside from the debasing temptations so common around them. I freely admit that much has been done in the last few years, but how much remnains to be done, and howrauch depends upon our exertions. Let us not rest until every regiment shal have its chaplain, and until a Christian school and a Chrlstian schoolmaster at every station shall show that we at home are most earnest for the I supply of the religious necessities of our own trcops at least. But to come nearer home than this matterof the soldiers whom we send to guard our Indian empire. How many of us have brothers, sons, and nephews in that country, and at this time how very strongl does it force itself upon our minds that our training of them at home before we sent them forth, was not exact,ly such as was best suited to make them exhibit examples of what Christlan soldiers and Christian officials ought to be in a heathen land, Ifn any family has at this time within it a young man who is training to go forth to any office in India, let the heads of it J take care to lay before him elea'rly what he is going out to do. Let them impress upon him-and in those tender mo- ments which cannot but be called forth when a young man, is leaving his home, perhaps not to revisit it for years, the i voice of warnng must sink deep in his heart-that he must' demean himself in that heathen land as a Christian ought, and must show what a privilege it has been to have had a Christian training in the very centre of a Christian church, (Cheors') Let us now just for one momenthumbly, nos dogmatically, consider what have been God's plain purpose in permittiing this most extraordinary outbreak of Satanic wickedness. And, first, God has proved to us in a plain way that all of us are dependent upon Him from day to day. It so happened that in 1848, that memorable year when the thrones of Europe were shaken to their foundation, I was visited with a serious illness, whieh for a few weeks deprived me of the power of knowing anything which took place outside my own chamber. When I laid down Europe was in perfect tranquillity, and there was as little thought of any outbreak of demoniacal wickedness throughout the whole continent as there is now. When I awoke there was not a klng sitting on his throne but in our own beloved island, save those most nearly connected with it or in the further regions of the South or among the barbarians of the North. Nothing could more strikingly prove to one's mind the in. security of the world except it depend upon God. When we awoke one morning and found that that great empire of IdiaT, on which we had so much prided ourselves, had collapsed and was disappearing altogether, there were few persons I hope in this room who did rot feel the conviction forced home to them how dependent the world and all who dwell in It are upon the Almighty God who wields the destinies of our race. When God thus vindicated to Eimself the absolute governance of the world, He thought it right, it would appear, also to let us see what had become of those fine theories of human nature by which we were told that a man educating himself without religion might become a great andgood man. I fear wecannot for a moment hesitateto grant thathowever much we may have thought of it before we must for the future think very lowly of unregenerate human nature. We have seen what heathenism is. Many of us have been brought up with such an admiration of the old classical heathens that we had almost got to think that a refined heathen was not such a bad sort of man after all, But we now know what a refined heathen is-we know that in a moment he can he transforued into a raging beast, and that impelled by a spirit of demoniacal wickedness he can perpetrate deeds of atrocity such as we had vainly imagined the world would never again witness. In reading in the Epistle to the Romans St. Paul's description of what the refined classical heathens were we sometimes are inclined to think that it can scarcely be a true picture; but It was a true picture, aud now we have in every newspaper a true picture of what heathenism is even in this day. And if ofheathenismhavewe notalsoatraepicture of what Christianity is? (Cheers.) Shall we not all be forced by what has been going on around us to feel our Christianity more than wo ever did before? (Cheers.) What do you think it has been that has nerved these few Europeans to such extraordinary acts of daring, of self-sacrifice, and of heroic endurance ? I believe that the high spirits of young men aud their bold soldierlike daring may account for much; but these do not account for such quiet endurance in the midst of awful trials such as human nature never witnessed before. Talk of Roman matrons and Roman maidens ! we henceforth shall talk of English matrons and English maidens. (Cheers.) We know how, under circumstances to which it was impossible to suppose they would ever be exposed, they have risen superior to every attempt to degrade, every attempt to terrify them, and as long as the world lasts the memory of these mothers and daughters of England will be revered wherever the English naume is known. (Loud cheers.) We have set before us by them pictures of Christian resignation which we delight to venerate; and when we read their letters we find in them tho spirit which has nerved them to such trials. I read last night two letters from a lady, since smassacred, with her husband and child, who for weeks was expecting every hour thefate which at lastfelluponher.Whilein this awful expectation she wrote a journal day by day, which was transmitted to her friends, and never out of Holy Writ have I ever read words that spoke more truly of the reality of Christianity, of the strength of Christian faith than in those few pathetic pages. That Is but one specimen out of a hundred which we rejoice to think so maany families will be able to lay by and treasure up among their most precious possessions. We may also conclude that God Intends 'oy this great chastisement to teach us rightly to value our Christianity, to show that it has borne frnits In our hearts, and to showv this by our readiness to assist those who are in India, and, as this occasionoparticularly reminds us, by endeavouring in every way hereafter to spread the blessings of that Christiauity throughout the world. It may be lorg before this glorious result can be obtained, and the particular mode in which it is to be obtained may be difficult to perceive. We shall have no right to complain if the progress be slow, but we shall have great reason to complain if the slowDess of that progress arises from our remissness in sending forth men for the work. Bat I conhdently believe that there will be no want of men to go to preach the Gospel. This very emergency maay be Intended by God to rouse the slumbering energies of our young men. If it be true that the dangers of a soldier's life, as exhibited by the outbreak of war, have summoned men of all ranks to enliat in our army who hung back when there was no such call, so it wi!l be that, while we had difficulty in procuring missionaries in quieter times, we shall have many volunteers for this conflict with heathenism when the zeal of our young men is roused by what has taken place in India, it only those who have the direction of these missionary efforts be able to find them the means to go forth to advance their Mfaster's cause in that distant country. (Cheers.) The right rev, prelate concluded by moving the resolution. Mr. FULLxsa, M.P., seconded the resolution. It might he asked, he said, what connexion existed between the military revolt in India and the extension of Christian missions in that country. Far be it from him to seek to interpret the purpose of God in bringing about the disastrous events in India, but, inasmuoh as for the last 100 years we had neglected the duty which as Christians we owed to our fellow-subjects in that great 'empire, we might justly onelude that the present calamity, wlhich might be intended for a thousand other wise purposes, might also have for it4 object to draw our attention to the grievous omission of whioh we had been guilty. (Hear, hear.) Such in reaUty had been the result achieved, for it ceuld not he denied that recent events had led us to take a deeper interest in the affairs of India than we ever felt before, and especially to consider the duty which de yolved upon us of spreading tho Gospel among the heathen in that benighted land. Various attempts had been made to evangelize the inhabitants of India. The Portugtuese had tried the system of persecution, and the Dutch that of bribery, but both had failed miserably ; and although thi English had attempted neither to compel the people ta become Chrfstians nor to purchase their conversion, truth compelled him to declare that, instead of advancing the cause of Christianity, they had been obstacles and impdiments in the way of its introduction. (EHear, hear.) Re admitted that of late years there had been a vast improve. ment in this respect. A great change had taken place since the perlod when the Baptist missionaries, Carey ani Marshman, were not allowed to rest their feet in Calcutta ; but stiU it was a fact that a degree of subservience, highly discreditable to the English people, had been shown to the system of caste, especially in the army, and that even down to theoutbreak of the mutiny we had evinced a disgraeful reluctance to perform our duty as Christians in India. (Eear.) The Government, the people, and the ohurch had been all equally to blame. It was true that the church did not now present the unworthy spectacle which it exhibited 60 years ago, when it had done literally nothing fer thos spiritual irmprovement of the ~piepe in India; but could it be said with truth that 180 or 190 missionaries formed any-I thing like an adequate force for a country containing 1SO,0O'J,000 of people, steeped to the lips in superstitions and idolatiies of the foulestbn mulnost debasing nature? The Socirtby for the Propagation of the Gospel had not at the preseat moment more than 14 clergymen employed as mis. sionaries in the whole of Bengal. No duty was mnore incumbent upon it than that of extending its operations in that presidency, and one of its first efforts ought to ho the revival of the mission at Delhi. What was asked was not that revenge which was suggested in the newspapers-the utter destruction of Delhi, so that not one stone should rest uDon another, huxt the moro Christian revenge which heapea coais of fire upon the heads of the enemy. Was it too much to ask that the number of the society's missons in India should be doubled, that this country, out of its overflowing mass of wealth, should contribute another 830,0001. s-year to extend that which every one admitted to be the greatest of all biessings? And if the pecuniary mueans were found, if every Clhristian man, sincerely anxious for the spread of the Gospel, gave in pro- Eortion to his substance, he hadl little doubt that men woutld eforthcoming in the Church to offer themiselves as volauntcers in the great and noble work of the evangelization of lndia. (Cheers.) The resolution was puxt and carried unanimously. The Bishop of O-xvORD, in proposing the second resolu-iona, said,-The resoluxtion which has been committed to mne a to this effect : "That theo Proposal of the society to es%abIlih nt,u-slons in the presidential and ether principal cities. with a view to bring the truths; of Ohsistianits' before the minds of the uPper as well as the lower classesof India, is deserving of the minat oordile approbation and enceuragmeatt: and that It Is desirable to promote, by every avAilable meanis, the eduration, training, and ordintion of the more advanced native candidates or the work- of the ministry among their own countrymen." I should entirely symp,athize with the feeling of reluctance which was expressed by my right rev, brother who preceded me to speak upon this subject, if I thought our business today was in any deg-ree to express any oInion as to the mode In which the British Governmaent in Indi was In fuEture to be conducted, because I feel that to offer the slightest opinon upon that which seems to me one of the niost difficult and embarrassing questions which can possibly ho proposed to a Christianmpeople or to aChristian Government would be per. feetly out of tume and place. None of us ought to express so munch as the slightest approach to an opinionolnpon it nutil he bas before him facts and the results of inquiries which I believe no man in England or in India at this3 moment Can have. But I do not understand that in any sense to be our 'business hero. Neither is it that we ATe met together to throw any blame uponi any partienlar persons, parties, or officers who have been engaged in the past government of Indlia. Therefore I entirely agree In that with my right rev. brother, and I take it that was all he meaLt to say upon this point, because as to looking hack-niot for the purpose of blaming individuals-but to take a calm and Christian estimate of what has been the discharge of our nation as a nation, and our church as a church, of the trust which has been committed to it, tbat I hold to be one of our bounden duties upon such occsions as these. (Cheers.) I can conceive nothing-and I ens sure that there was no word which fell from my right rev, brother which was intended to contradict this-maore offensive to Him In whose service we hope to go forth with renewed alacrity than to refuse to take His rebuke calmaly , and to look back with deep contrition in Hlis presence at these things which have deserved His rod. It seems to me that it is a special function of the Church to exercise this prophetical faculty for the dull insensate worIl. She stands amid the perturbations of nations among the afflictions which the Almighty sends upon them. She sees the hand coming forth uponathe wall, tracing in burning characters the mystic sentences; she sees the wise men of the earth retiring with puzzled confusion from the enigma which they cannot interpret, and calm in her faith, in the justice and the love of Him whom she serves, and Inepired by Hlis wvritten word, she re;ds ihe writing which the world cannot decipher, and interprets to the people the behests andl the intentions of the Highest. (Cheers.) It seems to me to be her special function upon such occasions to takce the tone and language of that p,, ophet who, -when he would have revealed to him what God was about to do with Hfis people, prepared himself by huimbly confessing his own sins and t'he sins of hiis people, aR hich hadi brought upon them the miserable Babylonian captivity. Therefore I feel that what has fallen from Mr. Iluller Is a well-founded charge-that we maust acknowled.ge c'ur shortcomings as a people in this matter if we would do e ceptable service to God, and if we would awaken the Christian heart of this nation to a sense of its Christian duties. We are not met here to complain of onxe another, but in order that from this room there may go forth, through all the different circles which have their cenitres here to-day, an influence which shall awaken one determined resolution in the heart of this Christian people to rise -up as they have never risen up before to a sense of the great ends for which God has committed to us this enormaous trust. (Cheers.) When I look at it so I do subicribe with aix aching heart to the charge brought by Mr. Puller, not against the East india Company, nor the Indian Governnient, nor the Government at home, but against the whole nation, because, oven if there be such a vast separation in Eome respects between the people of England anid the East India, Company, yet the freedom of the English people is such that sooner or later It does make those who administer its affairs represenLt fairly what is the great mass, good or evil, of its opinions and desires, end that it is which makes the blame rest on the nation, and not on its agents. I subscribe for myself to the charge brought against us. I have mo doubt that we did not intend to encourage heathenism. GodaforbidI that such an accursedl thought shouldl be in the breast of any mnan, buit I bel.ieve that we were afraid and ashamed of the God of our Chiristianity ; that -we upheld our administration in India upon the tolerance of heathendom rather than on the belief that as God's Providence hsd givenx it to us, so God's Pxovidence would keep it for us. (Cheers.) I thLink it is of the greatest mnoment that we shouild understand what this really means. Was not the grea test crimne which this earth has ever seen committed upon its face justified and brought about by that same reasoning which has been used to justify our policy with regard to Christianity in India ? What was the argument of those who betrayed the Lord of Life?"Ilf we let him alone the Rtomans will Come and take away both our place and nation." The treat of God's ancient people rested rather upon the sufferance of the heathena than upon the might of God's everlasting power ; and has not this been our reasoning with respect to the spread of Christiarity in the East -.-"If we do this the Brahmins anid the Massulmans will come and take away beth our place and nation." Is naot this contrary to the writing writ ten in the Book of TruLth which we c-an hardly at this momaent read without trembling ?-" Whoever, therefore, shall be ashamed of me and of my words inx this adulterous and si nf ul generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels." If we are ashamed of this faith, and I will not weary you with details of proof that we have beenL ashamxed of it, is not what we have seen the very aspect of the judgment which Christians mnust hare looked for ? Is it not one of those things by which God forces a Christian people to Contemplate the position which it has almost unawares assumed. We maust never lose sight of the wvay in which our Indian empire has grown up. At first our settlemenLts there were mere commercial deposits along the coast of the country ; we had no notion of governing the people, but day by day, grain by grain, our dominion grew, no mnan knew how, until' It emnbraced the whole country, and still the oldi tradition, the commercial timidity, remained, which prevented meni from seeing all at once that from being bo,rely tolerated merchants they had become the rulers and administrators of one of the greatest empires which God had ever suffered to grow up in the world. From that miserable and hideous dream God has now awakened us, and awakened us by the very juidgment -which the Prophets of old were ini the habit of interpreting to the people of their time as a mark that God had a quarrel with them, and intended to draw them into a more true and perfect obedience to His will.We have reason to rejoice that Godbhasso chastised us. I believe that the admiiiietration of India would not have beeni changed as it ought and, we hope, wil be changed, but for this mnighty convulsion, which may be compared to those great convulsions of the earth that entirely alter in a moment the whole face of the globe, lIlfting level plains uLp into peaked mountains, and plunging lofty hills into the depth of some vast inundation. God has so dealt with us in order that we may assume in a spirit -worthy of Christians the new position in which Ilis right hand has placed us, and act, as we never yet have acted, with true Christian zeal and courage in the administration of our eastern em pire. It i s easy to say that this is only general advice. It mnust be general from the nature of the Case. We have to do withl principles ; it is for others to consider howv they may be carried into practice. Now, there is nothing which the English people more utterly dislike than timidity in the a.dministration of affairs, and yet, thougli it is alien altogether to ouir national character, I believe that It is the feature whichx has been stamped upon our religious administrationt of India. Such has been our fear of confessing the Lord, such our expectation that without Ills perpetual help we should he able to maintoAn our empire, that we haveobeen led unawares into what may he truly called an anti-national sin. We, whose fault it is that we are always ready to thrust our flsts intio the face of every nation on the earth, to play the braggadocio with every people under the sun, have actually cowered before the Pagan idolatries of India. (Hear, hear.) The reeolutionx which I have to propDse Calls upon us to pledge ourselves to a new line of conduct. It sets forth the necessity of establishing missions in the presldential and other ptLncipal cities with a view to bring the truths of Christianity before the minds of the upper as well as the lower classes of India-that is to say, by a great scheme endeavouring, with the only arms which a Christian church can use, openly and avowedly to assault the high places of idolatry in that land. The cobweb notions which have infested some brains of educating Mlahomedans and Brahmins until the polished heathen shall be capable of -participating in a silken administration, seekidg the happiness and good of all,thave been swept away by the besom of the Cawnpore destruction. (Cheers.) Why, the man who has shown himself to be the most under the power of that spirit of evil which has been let loose In India for our chastisement-Nana Sahib himself-is a man who has that kind of education in its greatest perfection, and who passed among our countrymen as a pleasaut and highly accomplished gentleman. Ah ! how like the tiger of his own jungles, when, sleek and smooth, with its claws soft as velvet, it plays with the little innocent whom it seems to guard! How like, also, the same tiger in its moment of fury, when it has given itself up to the gratification of Its brutal passions, and when its ve nature has burst forth in all its hideousness and atrocity ! A polished Brahmin or a polished M3ahometan is a savage still, and I trust that henceforth instead of confining ourselves to the cultivation of the native intelleet, we shall administer India not merely for oar own temporal advantage, but for the benefit of the people and the support of Christian truth. (Cheers.) How is that to be done ? Not by fraud or violence, not by leading the natives to suppose that they shal please England or avoid punishment by assuming the Christian faith, but by letting all our public acts declare that we are Christians, that vwo glory in belonging to Christ, and that we hold India for the good of the people because we are Christians. Let us declare that no man shall be injured because lie chooses to become a Christian, but thatas longaswe holddominionln India there shall hs protecon for all. That is the first thing. Then negatively, we jnssst not any more dreamn that vhen. we have got a few of our modern notionis, gathered from P ins. n ock's Catsechei,sm, into the minds of the natives, and left them strangers to God, we have miade them capablo of exercisng power; b3cause we must hold that we cannot have trrst in those who believe not in oars Lord. (Hear.) it ha p- pens, too, that the undoes, so far frora disllldg your attempting to converir them, if you do It with the only arms 'which you can lawfully use, have a love for the intalko- tuel exercitation which it imalles, even, while they remain attached to their native faith. Like the old Athenianu they love to hear and tell of something nowv, and therefore 'we have ant opportunity such as no people ever had before of spreading the Gospel among the heathen. We hiave the farther advantage of standing uIpon the vantage ground of a better civilization and hiSher intellectual gUfts. The other day I meot a szentleman connected with one of our highest families, who was a resident in India for 30 years He told me that upon one occasion the Rajah. of Gwalior, the ancestor of that Rajah who has stood so faithfully by us in the presnt mutinies, saidI to him,-" How is it that you English have so great a comnmand over us ?" His reply was,-"It is because you pray to an idol which can do no good to you, while we pray totheoCod of Heaven, through Hlis only Son, and our prayers are heard." The ma-a was still for a momnent. At last he said, III believe you are right."1 Mark how curiously you m;ay trace the hand of God inthis last outbreak. Whyadidthat man's family remain faithful to us? I verily believe that it was n=any on account of the moral and religious influence which the Resident obtained over that mnan's heart. He had got to trust him implicitly. The Resident had helped him to recover A large debt of which be had always despaired, and when it was paid it came home in bullock waggons, and the Rajah sent to say that he had ordered a certaia nuraber containing 400,OCOf, to stop at the Resident's door, as his share. Of ourso the Resident's answer was, "-I cannot take a single penny from you. What I have done I have done as a matter of rIght and justice." The Rajahs sent for him next day and said to him, "What a fool you 'were not to take the money, nobody would have known It. I should niever have told it." "1Buit," said the Resident, "there is One 'who would have known it--the eye that sleepeth not; and may own conscience would never have left me a moment's rest." Upo which the Rajah said, "You English are a 'wonderfulpneople, no Indaian would have done that." When the Resident was going away the -ajah isent for him andl as'ked him for advice as to his future policy. III will give yout this advice," said the Resident, "1it Is very likely that troublesome days will comne-but don't be led away. It may appear as though the power of the Company was going to be swept away. Don't believe it ; it never will ha; and those who stand firm by the Company will in the end find that they haLve made the beat choice." The Rajah's reply was, "1I believe you are right;"' and he transmitted that doctrine down to those 'who came aft-er him. There, I believe, is the history of Gwalior remaining firm, when so many other princes have fallen from us, because Christian principles had been there brought to bear upon the rulers of that people. (Cheers.) That Is what we propose to do_by missions in these days. The proposal to train young natives so that they may be fitted for t-he work of the ministry among their own countrymen is of the first ims. portance. I believe it Is essential to the true Conversion of any nation to the faith. There is no reeord upon the face of the earth of any nation heing permaanently coniverted until ministers of ChristiaDity were reproduced out of the native stock. With a stranger there miust always be separate influence at -work, bett with natives there must be mnany allying and welding influences. The merefactof.being spoken to in the beloved native tongue would have a great effect. Close to our doors in Ireland we kniow how the sound of the native tongue goes home to the hearts of the people ; but irn such a land as India it will have tea times th effect. Moreover, It is not possible to find maen enough here to preach the Gospel to 160,000,000 of people-one in sir, remember, of the 'whole humn race. T'herefore, 'withouit training niative youth lb is net pDssible for us satisfactorily to perform the work. And oh!I how differenit will be the training from that which they now receive. There is nowanuenormonesdemand for the worksof all our pi incipal Deists for the rising generation of India, so tha6tto alltheold superstitionsof the country thereoare super. added the destruactive Infusions of doubt which have been p reduced out of the seething mans of those'who in ouLr own land have lap sod into unbelief. Instead of such traininq as this, 'we propose to edlucate the youth to be bearers of thec truth of Christianity to their fellow-countrymen, We must have there a great increase of bishops. This most. ing is not called for the purpose of promnoting an increase of the episcopate in India, hut I do not mean to shrink from avowing that it is our opinion that more bisops are naecesary in India. We want bishops ina India. and, what is more, 'without bishops 'we never can adequately discharge the work of preaing theGospelin India. (Cheers.) You want b5sops in ITndia now for the same reason that you want enerals in a time of war. In time of peace you are satisRed with an army which merely discharges the duties of a police, without any great general. You can do then with. an old general, whose infirmities prevent him fromi mouinting his horse; but when a state of actual warfare comes then the excellent old gentleman finds that his gouty foot makes him unable to he a general such as youL wanit. It is the same thing 'with regardl to bishops. You mutst have combinedI movements. Your efforts must hea united under one head-you must trust to Christ, the Head of the Church, and to an organized church ac'ting under Hlis own officers. Therefore, if you increase your native priesthood you must increase your bishops, and you must not act as you did when you committed to the care of the Bishop of Calcutta the distant province of the Punjab, which no man living can administer as Bishop of Calcutta. Our missions, too, require to be administered with mnore vigour. I freely adinit that in this respect we have made Advances of late years, but it was only while the brother of my righLt rev, friend near me (th BihopofJamnaica) was Bishop of Madras that the disincios o catewere abolished in the Christian. That alone is a fact 'which may account to us for not having prospered miore abundantly than we have done in this work committed to~ us. Bet, if we do God's wfi ini this through India, there will be no liwit to the blessings which He 'will bestow upon our work. I read the promise of these blessings in these very sufferings. I remember that the last and fierce-st outbreak of the old heathendom against the Church of Christ, in that terrible persecution of Diocletian, immediately peeceded the couver.'ion of the Roman empire to the faith of the Crucified. And why did it? Because those powers of darkness, reading thesigns which men's hearts furnishedforth, saw that the time was daily approaching for the triumph of Christianity, so that they gatherzd them. selves together for one last and terrible effort to put down the faith of Christ. And so I hope it has been in Indfa. The god of this -world has rend in mnany respects the signs of the coming time,and has gathered up his servants to one last but, I believe, hopeless effort. Bat I doubt not that if we risenow at the call of God, ready for His work, we shall be enabled to carry 't out abundantly, far more than has ever yet been given to us to do. Miy right rev, brother at tho commencement of these proceedings expressed a wish that we had some one among us who had himself been in those scenes, and who could speak with that force Twbich practical experience alone e'n give. Since I came into this room a letter fromi the Lord Bishop of Madras has been put into my hands, which seems to furnish the witness whichi my right rev. brother desired, The right rev, prelate writes:- ' Ten or I L clergymen whomn I knew, molt of tbhen with wives and families, are anougthe slain. Two promichi,g missloos, Cawopore and Delhi, teis last the most promising I have known, the miesi-narlet. their wives arid families murdered by aeassairre, the churchea, schools and catechist heiress destroyed, the catechist., schoolmasters, and the whole hody of native Christians cut off." You see it is the cross which is most hated, the white skins in its measure, hut the cross stamnped upon it most bitterly of all. My right rev, friend goes on : "1How wonderfuil are the dealings of the Almighty in permitting nil there things, but he dooth all things welL. I rejoice to "id that the, venerable Society for the Fropaga-tion of the Gospel has determined to reuewF these missions. Oh I it will he a fertile soil, wateredI with the precious blood of sommany martYrs-meni. too, As I cana testify, who c-ounted not theoir ivres dear in them in the cause of Christ. If, as I believe will he the care, there deaths; will produco a glorious result in the harvest of souls seapsed from them, the cause for which they lived end died will bo the gainer. They, being dead, will yet conatinue to speak in all coming tine.,' He~ goes on to say- "iusrely many a noble youth from our UnIversitIes will spring forth to I'be baptized for the dead' to ,urceed in lbs ranks of the departed, to enter Into their lahours, and to reap the reward of the conviersions which, through God's mnercy, shall follow their toils, their trials, And thoir deathY' Already his prophecy has been fulfilled, Sinceo I entered this room I have heard that two men of mark, rank, and promse fom or Uiversities have sent in their names as read togo frthandtake up the standard which has dropedfro th hadsof the martyred servants of our Lor ir Inia.(Her, ear.) The Bishop adds, There are two facts reselting from the mutlriy which I hope will not ba forgottrs-viz., that wherever Christian influence has meest prevailed there has been least causen for fear and mocst attachment to our Government ; and where there has been miset jealosey to keep) men from Itn influence there the violence mid had passions of the mutiny have been most prevalent." Hlere is the witness who was desiredl at the opening of the meeting. Here the voice of the Bishop of Madras witner-es to you from what he sees aroutnd him of what he's occurred, andl of what in God's Provienceis expeted-t hI. sick we may de. ive comfort from the reflection that England is still permitted to enjoy opportunities for spreading the truths of the Gospel such as no nation since Chrirs tianity was founded ever bfore po-sessed; and I doubt not, if Gcd is pleased to give us a mind to rio His will, a spirit of prayer and a spirit of united labour, there is before the English church and nation a bright and glorious future. God is not like unfaithful men. He does not cast away the instruments which bave performed the duties He intrnsts to them; and I doubt not, if we attend to tbings spirituri in India as we have done to the lesser things of this world, above the ancient honours which God has givenusshallarise the now hononr of bting the conquerors of the East. Asthe noblest jewel wbich adorns theregalia of our ancient Throne, or shines on the fair brow of England's Queen, comes from distant India, so, beside our maritime supremacy, our r ommercial greatness, onr colonial extentbeside that blessed spirit of national liberty wh'ch we have bcen enabled to retain and exhibit for so many generations to a wondering world-shall stand this new " mountain of light,"-rezcned and evangelized India. (Cheers.) Sir W. P. W1"ooD seconded the resolution. He beiieved with the Bishop of Oxford that Christianity had been kept in abeyance in India from a cowardly fear of losing tho commercial advantages which we enjoyed In that country. He believed, also, that thatvery suppression of Christian tauth had brought upon us tho fearEul calamity of the present mutinies The natives, being told tbat we were Christians, and finding the Government doing nothing openly to advance the cause of Christ, naturaUy came to the conclusion that we intended to proceed by craft, and that suspicon led to the disastrous events which we now deplored. e trusted the time had passed when it could be gravely ad vanced as a charge against a Governor.General that he had subscribed to a misslonary society. The policy implied in that accusation was neither understood nor approved by the natives themselves, who maintaiaed that a man should n@yor bo ashamed of his faith, amd who had always refused -. to believe that it was not our design to convert them, II0V openly indeed, bat in an insidious and underhand mannelr Betveen liberality and indifference there was a wide gull. The one was the esence of Christian love; the other th3 grossest selfishness. Without exercising the smallest conpulsion the Christians in India might, by the example of their lives and professions, have great effect in the evangelization of IndSa, for none knew beiter than the Indian " By their fruits ye shall know them." Much might he done, too, b bringing the English and native minds as much as possible in contact. 'This was compaatively easy, for t'he overnment might require that no native should take an offive unlens he could speak the English tongne, and that no Englihmnp in turn should be placed in a position of authority unless he were well acquainted wita the native languages. GreoM good must undoubtedly arise from such a regulation. it had been said very lately by an influential portion of the press that it would be better at first not to turn menk' minds from the duty of providing for the widows anil orphans of those who had fallen; that after that duty hadZ been discbarged It would be time enough to talk about the extension of missionary effoits ; but all thkse arguments proceeded upon the gross fallacy of suppoingthAt Christian charity would be limited to anyone channeL He areed with the member for Hertford that we 2must not ba discouraged by the magnitude of the task, Thirty or fos~ missionaries might be a small numberto sendamong o large a population as that of India, but it was the duty of Christian men to do what they could, oven though that; might be little, and to trust in God's Providenoe that two, three, or four missionaries would be suflident tq leaven the mighty mass of heathendom. He was glad that it was proposed to send out more bishops. The result of the establishment of colonial bishoprics had been most suocess. ful wherever it had been tried, and it had been found that the combined and organized efforts of missionaries working under one head had been oroductive of far more good than the scattered effort. of independent mlssions, In conclusion, the learned Vice-Chancellor exhorted hbi hearers to give liberally in proportion to their means, Inthc fuU confidence that a blessing would attend their devotion to so holy a cause. The resolution was put and carried unanimously, The Bishop of ST. ASAP}1's moved, that the cordW thanks of the meeting be given to the Archbishop for pro. siding, and that subscription iists be opened on behalf of the extension fund in every town and village In the country. Mr. W. CoTTox seconded tWs motion, which was sup, ported by The Bishop of MORAY and Ross, who suggested that a. deputation should be appointcdtoadvocabe the clalmauf thc fund inBScotland-a country which had derived immenws temporal advantage from Idia, and which in return was anxious to promote the advancement of Christianity among the Hindoos. The motion was agreed to; and tho ARcHBisoP having ackn c ed themeeting separated.
