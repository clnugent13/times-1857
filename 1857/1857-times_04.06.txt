His Royal Highness on a former ooarion haW expressed his approbation of the 3-pounder batteries, in which their Lordships readily eoncaured, and, to verify the facility ith which the ammundtion waggons are convertible for the eay transport of the wounded, the Duke desired an attendant to enter one of the vehicle, wbhen his Roya Highness, having wheed it forward some pace., again repeatea to Colone Tloh Is admiration of its compactnem and efficiency. They thenoe proceeded to the mahes in Plumtead, wbere, notwithstanding the inoessant fall -of rain throughout the day, the preedings . commenced, as- arrnged, pre cisely at 2 o'clock ' The first expeiment was with
vera wought and ca-iron shot from 68-pounder guns, fiLred at a wooden butt faced-With sundry sample plates of sheet-Iroi three-quarters of an inch in thicinee. The guns were directed by a party of gunners told off from theIst Battlion of the Royal Artillery, and were aimed with prbcision. Colonel Tull6h, Major Vande9Ur, and Captain B ojer, offioers of-the Royal Aztillery Corps inW6ol. wich Arsenal, superintended the proceedain, which were watched bi Lieutennt-Colonel Picketing and Captain Campbell, LA., secretay and xssstant secretary of the select committee. The .firt shots were over- a flight of 1,200ya4 which wa, ultmately reduced in proportions of 200' ards, and they were finally fired at a proximity of -40 yards fro the trget. Attention wssthen directed to
the anUthn%of a 36-gtm frigste, erected for the purpose of testingMartin's shells (containings cbargeof28b.of molten iron) in the destruction of ships of war. Thep ointof attack showved a perfect broadside, reembling a hipat sea,-iuto 'which aumber of sheUs and redhot shot were alternately projected, over rious rang(* varying from 1,200 to 400 yards giving ample time between esah discharg to obeer
the effec.-. It wasremarke&that the ignition produced by the liquid iron was considerably mere speedy and effecwtl thin by th. agency Of the redhot shot. The time required to diseolve,the metal, and the meats now employed to effect the purpose, are more available than those necesay for heoting shot, and the advantag was, therefore, pronounoed to be in favour of Martin shells.

Saturday Evening.
ThIe unfavourable character of the Bank return caused the English funds to open this moinig at a furt2her decline of an eighth, but at the close of the day, owing to arrivals of Australian gold, there was less unsteadiness Consols for lmoney were first quoted 93; to , and they left off at 93j to _ for money, and 9 to J for the May account. Bank Stock closed at 220 to 222 with dividend; India Stock, 222 to 224; Exchequer-bonds' 98§ to J; India Bonds, 5s. discount to par; and Exchequerbills (June), 6s. to 2s. discount; (March) par to 3s. premium.
This being the 4th of the month the amount of bills falling due was extremely heavy. Owing to the large number met at the Bank the reserve of that establishment must have been strengthened. In all quarters the payments vere well made, and the discount-market during the day was fiee from any severe pressure.
Foreign securities have been rather heavy, and prices at the close exhibited a slight decline. 1Turkish Six per Cents. for the account -were negotiated at 97i, i, 96k, and 97k; and the Four per Cents., for money and account, at 101. The general business comprised-Granada New Active, 23k; Peruvian Three per Cents., 54i and 64; Portuguese Three per Cents., for account, 1856, 46; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents, 956; Spanish Certificates, 64, and i; Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 90i; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65; the Four per Cents. Certificates, 96k and ; and Peravian Four-and-a-Half per Cent. Dollar Bonds, 58.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 60c. for money and 70f. for the end of the month, showing in the latter case a further decline of nearly a quarter per cent. The demand for money is heavy, and it is complained that the Bourse is again overloaded with securities.
The Simla steamer, from Australia, has brought 85,000 ounces of gold valued at 340,0001. The Autral, from Geelong, Las 6,394 ounces and 30,000 sovereigns, making 55,5761. ; and the Marco Polo is also reported, with about 50,0001. The Royal Oharter is hourly expected, with 488,0001. in golddust and 13,000 sovereigns.
The 340,0001. of gold brought by the Simla is not expected overland from Marseilles, but will be bronght by the Jura to Southampton.
It appears that the Oneida, Australian steamun, left Kiing George's Sound on the 3d of February, and had not arrived at the Mauritius on the I st of March, an interval of 26 days, although the Simla performed the distance in a week. Tt is therefore certain that some accident must have happened to her, and the hope is that it has been simply a break-down of her machinery. This vessel consumes an enormous quantity of coal; but it is scarcely thought the detention can have been caused by her supply having falen short. She had 70 pamsengers, and 40,0001. in gold.
The railway meetings of the week have not been numerous, but they have presented some facts of interest. The report of the Scottish Central has been adopted, with tho exception of those points relating to the detail of accounts with the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee Company. An unavoidable increaee in the capital account, of 21,0001. has occurred to provide additional accommodation for traflic, especally at Stirling, now an important place, and the terminus of many lines. According to the report of the directors of the Great Western of Canada Company, a dividend at the rate of 9 per cent. will be paid, absorbing 13,2381., and leaving 4,5761. to be carried forward. The revenue is steadily increasing, but the locomotive expenses are heavy. AttheJedburghmeetingitwasannoumcedthat the undertaking has been completed, and that it has passed into the possession and management of the North British Company under the terms of the working agreement. The Stirling and Dunfermline report has been adopted, and the interim dividend of 6s. per share has been declared. At the Midland Great Western meeting the dividend was at the rate of 5 per cent., and the revenue of the company is stated to be progressively increasing The dividend of the irish South-Eastern Railway has been confirmed at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, and the Bagenalstown and Wexford line will, it is expected, be completed in about 12 months. The report of the Dublin Bncl aiugatown Railway has been agreed to, and a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. for the past half-year has been declared. The directors of the Horneastle Company have announced a dividend at the rate of 4A per cent, per annum, and the revenue exhibits a slight increase. It was stated at the Glasgow, Dumbarton, and Helensburgh meeting that the funds
ow available are considered suffcient to complete the line.
The accounts from New York by the Hermann describe no material alteration In any of the markets. A few failures had occurred durin, the week, the principal parties being Alexander ']rear and Co., for 160,0004; Blashfield, Clark, and Co., for 50,0001.; and M. Bettman for 26,0001. Illinois Central Railroad shares haA suddenly declined from 37+ premium to 32, owing to a resolution to create additionl atock to the amount of half of that vhich already exists. A third of this is to be issued on the 1st of July, and the remainder on the 1st of January, in the ratio of one share of the new to two of the old stock on payment of 30 per cent. The motives for the stop are not stated, and, as the policy of issuing new stock when 70 per cent. remains uncalled on the existing stock seems objectionable, the reaction it has occamoned is natural. 1,500,0001, or nearly one-half of the stock, is held in England, while the meetings of the company take place at Ceicago. The formation of a committee on this side would probably be desirable and satisfactory to all parties,
hie Geelong has arrived from China with 399,4001b. of tea and 1,267 bales of silk.
It appear, in connexion with the recent disclosures of the mismanagement of the Australian Agricultural Company, the directors consider that they, and not the shareholders, are the persons aggrieved. The board is composed for the most part of leading merchants or bankers, who are able to exercise a considerable influence over any le6s important personages of whom committes of consultation may be constituted, and the consequence has been that at the assembly on Thursday last when the report of the late investigation was trought up, there was a manifest disposition on the part of the committee on coming face to face with the directors to be frightened at the thunder they had themselves made, and In exact accordance with Crimean experience to join eagerly with the latter in denouncmg the press as the sole cause of any odium that might have been created. The report of the committee had commenced by pointing out that with a paid-up capital of 380,0001., and a Crown grant of 690,702 acres3 the concern was last year in a position not only to make no return, but to produce a loss of several thousand pounds; that the directors had committed a seriois error and Incurred a grave responsibility in their choice of a superintendent; that duning a period of nearly four years, in which circumstances took place "' admitting neither of palliation nor excuse" they abstained from frankly communicating to the shareholders their causes of dissatisfaction with him; that in the meanwhile
ftocks estimated at 130,001. had dwindled to a value of 510111.; that a full report on the subject received in March, 1855, had been withheld; that during the period of this concealment one director had sold 1,090 shares; and, finally, that "the grOas ad exteve abuses which have -been allowed to germinate on the estates of the company, and tho promiscuous mode in which its accounts have hitherto been kept, have fostered a system of extravagance which no private establishment could have possibly survivod." Uponthopublication of this the sole remark made was that it presented another Illustration of the way in which property at a distance belonging to shareholders in Egland is squandered, the directors at home being too numerous and too much occupied with their own puruits to excercise t hat watchfulness which a private person wvould feel essential to safety, aad aubsequently, in speak-ing of the North of Europe Steam Companyz, it wsobserved that its directors, ."like those of the Australian Agricultural' Comn-
any," had perilled the entire property of their con xtituents byleavisj it reckldeiy in the control of asingle person. o luion was m8de toindividual directors, and, although the public were entitled to intuire, and are naturally curious in such emu the mention of naines was areftlly avoided, so as to prevent,, as far sa posible, anything like personal annoyance. It soon transpired, however, tbat the directors were extremely angry at their -position. The facts-themselves, it was admitted, could not be denied, but that the public should have
been furnished witlhl a concise and unimpasioned andconsequently effectivei sumg, of them was understood to have-been regarded aa intolerable. Accordingly, at the meeting on Thursday, one of the earlieat statements of the chairman of the committe6 from whom the report proceeded was to deprecate the indignation of the directors, not by announoing the report to be erroneous, for he stated that its correctness had not been and could not be disputed; but by disowning all concurrence in the cornments made by " the publc press," the tone and spirit of which he considered both incorrect and unjustifiable. Another member, a Mr. Morgan Yeatman, still more anxious to do penance at the ox5ense of any one e]se than himnself, followed up the apology with much greater £orce, considering not only that the remarkss had been unwarranted, but that 'theg were to be regarded. with "utter disgust." Mr. Smith, M.P., likewise thought they had been "improperand unfounded," aiidtheBoard, thus consoled exchanged compliments with the comittee, the governor of the company taking the opportuity to Increase the impression as to the hardness with which they had been treated by saying that they had been classed with the Royal British Baik,-a simple flight of elocution, since the Royf British Bank had not been alluded to i connexion with them. It happened, however, that the shareholders
were not altogether misled by this. diversion, and I that, notwithstanding the usua threats of reation with wbich it is always sought to terrify persons in such a situation whenever they do nob submit approvingly to the loss of their propery, 1 they insisted upon adopting a course which? while it spared the directors, as every one would wash, from needless reproach, will virtually remodel the whole concern. A more severe result would have been undesirable, but if it had happened the directors
would have had only themselves to blame. By in-' venting the grievance that they had been coimpared with the Royal British Bank they challengeT the perception that in concealing the exact position of the company lest the announcement should- affect. its interests they had acted in a certain degree on the principle which is put forward as an apology by such of the few directors of that concern as are in other respects free from imputation. It must also have been seen that whatever may' have been the' purity of their motives it would be difflcuit for, them to persuade those who had purchased shares In the interval that they had not been damaged.. When also the directors attempted to show, owing to the nominal and delusive price obtained for the Peel River estateunderthe excitementof thegolddiscoveries, that, instead of their ropertyhaving beensquandered, the shareholders h. received large returnF the irralevant nature of the argument might have inspired a feeling that there was still a disposition rather to evade the points at issue than to meet them fairly. In the appendix to the report of the committee there is a pertinent queston from i'Mr. Lawrence to one of the directors, "We have ex-
nded nearly 380,0001. in stocking the estate, and lshould like to know what there is to show for it " The reply was, " I never made a strict calculatioi, but my belief is we could not show above 150R000L, if w could showf that." In the face of thbs, and also of the evidence furnished in a recent despatch from Mr. Hodgson, the new superintendent of the company that the state of affairs which had led to it had been " going on for years," the effort to convince the proprietors that they had reaUy' something to be thankful for was a strong tempting of their forbearance. Here, however, the matter may drop. The directors have only fallen into a practice wEich has lately become commnon in higher quarters, of giving flat contradictions to pubic statement, without caring irhere the reproach of error may fall, so that they may themselves escape from the acknowledgment of it. There was every disposition to deal with the subject
temperately, and the' harshest word used wfas "mis-| mngemenlt." In return the phrase were that the course pursued to them had been "incorrect," "unfounded," "unjustifable," and "disgusting" Let them reflect whether this is becoming or calculated to create a belief that they possess those calm, businesslike habits which are essential to the conduct of large enterprises.

The directors urged the neceesity of personp interested in the line and dstrict sabcribing th* additional capital requird, and stated that they had hitherto used the utmost economy in the constroction of the works and the managementof the company's affairs, and they would continue to exercise the same control in the construction of the remaining portion of the line.

Lord Wodehouse gives dancing routs, -which are got up with admirable taste, and he himself, with Lady Wodehouse, does the honoura of them in a most
gh . manner. He occupies tho Hotel Lazareff, on the place of the Michael Palace. The mansion is not a very large one, but it is certainly a very comfortable ono, and excellently well suited for Lestive assemblies. One of these w as given last Thusday, and nothing was 'wanting to make itbperfect. There were 125 persona at Su per, and every guest seemed to be the especial object of the hosts attention. several Englishmen were present, with their vives. The ,whole of tho English colony is delghted with its Minister, who deserves their praise. Lord Wodehouss was no sooner settled at St. Petersburg than he sought the acquaintance of his countrymen; and the consuil Mr. Miohele, not having yet arrived, he applied to the well-known merchant, Mr. Dwyor, whom be requested to introduce him to the chief English rssidents here. After this the Minister informed them that he had given orders for any businoss applications they might have to mako to be attended to without delay, Ie then invited ten of the English residents to dinner, with the ladies of their families, and he has since given an English dinner party at the Eloiel Lazareff every week. This is the manner in whioh the representatives of Great Britain abroad are accustomed to pay zespect to their fellow. countrymuen."

The Elections.
THE ELECTIONS.
MIDDLESEX.
As the day of eleotion draws nigh the Conservative party appear to be recovering from the apathy with which they at first regarded the contest. Visconnt Chelsea's friends now express themselves with the same confidence as to the result which a few days ago Was exclusively shared by the committee of the Liberal candidates. The late appearance ofLord Chelsea in the field has prevented a close person.sl canvass of the electors, and, as the constituencj numbels about 15,000 electors, the result of the polling, 'whih commences this morning, is necessarily doubt. ful But the feeling against Lord Robert Grosvenor is so strong among large sections of the electors that some apprehensions are entertained as to the safety of his seat. The irritation caused by the noble lord's Sunday Observance Bill is not yet forgotten. The Hyde Park distnrbances, the police riot, the vindow-broaking at the west-end, -rtd the Commission of InqtLiry made Lord Robert so unpopular at the time, both with rich and poor, that if an election had taken place 12 months ago he would certainly hate lost his seat. The opponents of Sunday BiL say that it is necessary for -the electors once 'for all to set their mark upon Sunday obsereauce measures for the metropolis, and the publicans in the suburbant districts appear to be.fnUly disposed to endorse this opinion. The Conservatives are endeavouring to inake soe iepoliticai capital out of Baron Rothschild's speech in favour of Lord B. Grosvenor and Mr. Hanbury at the nomination at Brent.
ford, and have published placards wbich repreent- tEe' Liberal candidates as the Baron's nominees, and iskthe electors to repudiate such dictation. There seems to be no want of the sinews of war on either side. The defeats of the; Conservative party in the provinces ha've awakened them at
the last moment to the necessity of gaining some con-, spicuous seat, and the imetropolitan county offers somne facilities for their design. The struggle will therefore be of the keenest description.
On Saturday a meeting of the electors was held in Viscount Chelsea's Committee-room at the Hoop-tavern, Notting-hill. At 2 o'clock, when his lordship appeared, the large reom 'was densely filled. Captain Morley presided.
Lord CHELSEA, after a few preliminary remarks, beggedj to refer to the report in Tl;e Times of that day of a speech which purported to have been made at Hounslow on the previous nig,ht by the son of his noble relative and opponent; Lord R. Grosvenor. Mr.. Grosvenor had on that occasion made his malden speech, and he must give his gallant and juvenile relative credit for having characterized his first performance by bold, unscrupulous, and reckless assertions, such as wouldfit him for cutting a very creditable figure as a stump orator on the othert side the Atlantic. ("Oh, oh," and laughter.) His noble relative had *right to defend his father (hear, hear), but he had also referred to Mr. Hanbury and himself, and of this portion of the speech he had some. right for himself to complain. Mr Grosvenor said that the electors of Middlesex had had ton years' experience of his father's conduct, and that, although threig thavebeenoc&sionaldifferencesuponmInron,i he was surethattheyall agreed withLordR. Grosvenor inthe long run. Now, he' thought this a very mnodest piece of assurance on the part of MIr. Grosvenor, after the groaning, hissing, and hooting his noble relative and opponent received on the hustings for an hour and a-balf a day or two ago. (Hisses, and cries of "From some of your militia men." He begged to say they were not his militia meh. He had only 22 men remaining, they were disermbodied, and considering that they were raised from the back slums of Westminster no body of men behaved themselves better than his men did from tho time they-were embodied till they were disbanded. In allusion to the unfortunate Sund4y Trading Bill which his noble opponent intendedUo pass, Mr. Grosvenor said he admitted that that Bill had caused his father to become un pular, because the facts were misrepresented, but that when he found public feeling was so strong against it his noble father gave it up; and could he do more? (Loud cries of " EHear, hear.") He (Lord Chelsea) would tell hun what he could do more. If his noble opponent conscientiously believed that the measuYe he had ntroduced, in his conscientious opion, was calculated to improve the social and moral condtion of the people he ought not to have given it up under the power of anyiniiuenee whatever. (Cheers, and "Oh, oh.") The noble lord had never admitted that he had done right ingiving up that measure, and yet in the dread of facing public clamour he withdrewv it. (A Voice.-"Very properly," and lau1hter.) He denied that he was beaten out of Dover by the ate member for Miiddlesex going there. He had resigned his seat- for Dover before it was known that Mr. Bernal Osborne was going there. and therefore he could not have been beaten by him. He was taunted with calling himself a "Liberal Conservative" (hear, hear), and from whom did that taunt emanate? Why, from his noble relative and his son. He would ask what position did his noble relative take in 1852, when the Government of Lord John Russell was displaced by the Administration of Lord Aberdeen. Did he not support the Aberdeen Administra. tion? (Hear, hear.) And whatv asthe declaration made by Lord Aberdeen when on the first night of his Administration he brought forward his programme of principle s? Did he not designate himself and his 4Government a f" Liberal-Conservative" Government . and, although that title was now ridiculed by his noble relatve and his son, he would ask did hi" noble friend ovQr 91V4 IOie VAtA against that Govern. meont from the day of its aavent twertillitsdLstLon? (" No! no!'" and " Yesl yes ") The noble lord then declared his view of a "Liberal-Conservative' to be that which he avowed himself to be-namely, an idberent of the principles laid down by that great statesman the late Sir R. PeeL
A sharp fire of questions was then put by Liberal electors,
in answer to whichr,
Viscount CHELSEA said that with regard to the ballot he was an out-and-out supporter of 'Lord Palmerston, who had over and over again voted against the ballot. (Cheers and uproar.) The ballot enabled a man who bad voted one way to pretend he had voted another and thus render his whole life a continual lie. (Hear, hear.j As to the extension of the franchise, as a Liberal-Conservative he could see no reason why he should not support a moderate proposal to increase the class on which the representation of thecountry sbould rest. (Hear, hear. He did not see that any money line conld be drawn, but he thought that a man should be compelled to have such a moral and religious education as to enable him to exercise the franchise in a way most beneficial to himnself as well as his neighbours. (Cheers.) He really could not say whether he had voted agaist Lord R, Grosvenor's motion for limiting county elections to one day. (Great laughter.) He had repoatedly voted agaimst the admission of the Jews to Parliament, and intended to do so again. (Uproar.) He did not comuplain of this system of cross-examination of candidates, but it ought not to be one-slded. Why were
ot thesequestions put to-,his opponents, Lord Grosvenor and Mr. Hanbury 7 He had looked in vain in the press for them ; but as to the admission of Jews to Parliament he had been informed that Mr. Hanbury had only on the day of the hustings been compelled to make a distinct avowal that he would do so, and that at a previous meeting held at the Riding-school at Brompton he had refused to pledge himself to vote for the admission of Jews to Parliament. He had been told so by a gentleman present at that meeting (A Voice.-" Its true," and uproar.) It a eared asth election approached his opponent, Mr. £a&nbury, had become more squeezable. (Laughter, and "Oh l") Ho should certainly refuse to vote for triennial Parliaments.
Mr. G. LxvmsoN sxid they had heard the exposition of the opinions of Lord Chelsea, and he thought the meeting would agree with him that his viewswere not of that enlightened and liberal character which entitled him to be sist to Parliament as the representative for the county of Middlesex. (Cheers and uproar.)
The CflAJRMAN said he could not permit any seecch to be made. ("Oh, oh l" and shame.) Lord Chel had come there to explain his opinions, and to answer any questionS, but not to hear speeches from electors, (" Oh, oh ;" " Shame " and uproar.)
Air. LEVxRsoy said he must protest against such a doctrine-that they were to come thae and then be denied the riht of speech, which was the right of every Englishman.
Lord CHiELSsA said he had to meet another body of eleetors in a distant part of the county, and therefore he hoped that the gentleman would not waste his time and that of the meetig (" Oh, ob," and "GCo on.")
Mr ERvsSON said Lord Chelsea professed to be a folower of that great man Sir R. Peel, but he was onlv a follower of that great man during that unfortunato period of his life when he was antagonistic to the liberties of the people. (Hear, hear.) He begged to movo "That in the judgment of the meeting the public opinions of Lord Chelsea are opposed to political and social improvement, and that he is not therefore qualified to represent the couinty of Middlesex. (Chbeegrs and uproar.)
Mr. PrTORD, the High Baiiff of Southwark, seconded the motion. Upon the result of the sbow of binds,
The chairman refused to give any offcial decision, and Mr. G-rneisen (secret to the ConservativeLand Society) moved a resolutvon expressive of confidence in Lord Chelsea. When this was put a decided minority of hands was held up, and instead of putting the contrary the chairman and noble lord abruptly quitted the meeting, amid ,aughter and ulDroar.
MIr:PRITCHABD was then called to the chair, and ex. pressed his astonishment at the conduct which had been pursued, not only in the gentleman who had precoeded him in the chair refusing to hear any one make any observa. tions, but in treating the meeting with the disrespect he had done.;
MYr. LEVEsON and other gentlemex then further ad. dressed the meeting, and the following resolution wa3 then put and carried unanimously:-
" That In the judguientef this eetlng the publeo opinions Of Leni Chelsea axe opposed to polUtical and nolmprovement and that hot not therefore qualified to zepreent the oounty of liddlee,x; but that ou the contrary, Lord obert Grosvenor and Robert Hanbuxy.uq, a a the exponents of thse LOeral pinciples ot clvii and reldous liberty. to the maintenance of wbleh this country is mo much Indebted for het Droser:ty and happines, we pro-eminently entitled to the eonfldenoe of the ebeotoa"
A vote of thanks to Mr. Pritchard, as chairman, was then carried by acclamation, and, three cheers having been given for Lord R. Grosvenor and Mr. Hanblsry, the meeting separatod.

Lord PirVBX'SXY alluded to the new iiboral cizdidate as aost a stranger to the county, who depeiided more than anthing else upon -the name of Cavendiih '(Uproar.) Be begged to assure them that -his: principles w e un. changed, and he hoped that the opinion entertained- of him then had not changed-either...

In the last Parliament a motion as bxought in by Mr. Muntz for the abolition of the,incoine-tax on mcomes under 1501. a-year. He considered the tax abominable in itself, and additionally objectionablewhpn it pressed upon income3 so low as those at present brodght tnder it; therefore, should MIr. Iuntz bring forward his- motioI agaii, -he should be prepared to support it. (If If you're in the Houe," and laughter.) He advocated peace, retrenchnent, and reform-peace, consistently with the national dignitT and honour ; retrenchment, but at the same time, the keepuig up of the different parts of te service; reform, so far hs reparded the revl =b.esf the constitution. (Applause. )Parllamenthad been dissolved upon a questionof fore gpoucy and the whole country was-running mad after 'ord PalmerAl:n. There was a cry for the man, not formeasurs. Thi had arisen;chiefly on his Lordship's foreign policy'- but would that bear a moment's consideration? It-was aid thathis narne was heard throughout the continent. True, but It wis not revered so much as-it was-detested. Ask the Sardinians wbat they thought of Palmerston when they heardand it was a fact-that there,wasiaety granteeing to Austria her Italian States ? Ask thuprisoxiers in the dungeons of Naples if any whisper came to themXof the strong desire felt in this country that'vweshould do something to ameliorate their condition ? Take another point of his foreign yolicy. -What'had his Lordship got forts?? - Why, a PrussianPrince for the Princess Roya, ndhe'wasgoin ta make us pay. He (Lord Pevensey)was not such a friendto the Prussian Government that he would everconitntdeviate from the old principles on wliicb-allfices hadbeez; formed with the first-rate Powers of Europe. In conclgsion his Lordship referred to the Chinese wa, expressng an opinion that the word of Lord Derby ought to be taken as concluively negativing the assertionof there being uny corn bination to oust Lord Palmerston. .
Mr. DoDSoN said, when haecame-forward and told them. that he advocated measures of progressive reform 'and of social provement-measures for th& good'of the -com. munityatlargeetheghad this guarantee forilstruthfulnes,that he was desirous of -acting-with that party who had been the great proWoters of all improvements, and hot -withthose who hated the -very -sound- of it.. (Cheers.) In the late divison some he believed there were who voted Itomcon. scentious and others- -actuated by- factious motives - the former he could respect, but what could he say of ;tentle.. men waro, thinking that the Chinese war was unjustifiable,could nor come- forward and- ask -the con6try to return. them pledged to support Lord Palmerston in carrying oD that unjust war? - (Hear,- hear.) It was, however only of a piece with the course which they pursued when, in 1852, they were returned on the cry of "Protection' to agriculture," and iimmendiately they got'into the House turned in favoar of the free trade policy_ Cheers.) In other respects their conduct had been euailly iconsistent, and-now that they had momentarilymade pro. fesdons ofiLiberalism to secure their seats they found temselves verg much-
"Like a bedgpbog soned the wfonrwky
Tormenting itself wih its prlckle."
(Laughter,) Mr. Dodson proceeded-o justify Lord Palmerston in various charges. brought against him. As to the great point made by Lord Pevensey in respect to the dungeons of Naples, the result of-the movements made by Lord raimorstonL was to obtain some relief to'those prisoners,-a
some of them were pernmittedlto emigrate. - He trusted that the result of this appe to the cotutry-would bea Houseof O~moas ~Hi~ y uDied b~ prncPle to sec evlottr of action at home and abroad, andQthat they mighte-anAdministration formed- etrong- enough to carry substautial
rseasures of mprovement, as well as to adopt such a foieignpolicy asshonld secure peaceful relations without dishonouto the British 'dag in all quarters of the globe. (Cheers.) An hon. gentleman opposite had aUuMded to intimidation being exercised upon the Crowtn tenants, Since that a letter had been placd in his hands from the agent of the ChiefCommissioner of -Woods and Forests to this effect:--
Mr. Gore has been informed that the Crovn tenants In sume - have been pressed by letter to vote for i,articulsr candidats Mr. Gore bas always rerained himself from interfeing with the votes of the Crown tenants, and wisheg you to be entirely unfettered. He thinh It Improper that the Crown teuants should be interfered with a* all, and oertainly not in favour of -candidates opposing the existing Goversnmeot."
(Cheers.) The reason of that- letter being written, added
r. De n, was ("the screw")-yes, the screw-it was in consequence of one of the rovwn tenants being threatenedL with ruin if he dared to vote for him. (Cheers.)
Colonel CAvmnsusisaid it-was scarcely three weeks since he was asked to come forward as a-candidate for this division. He had then no -thoughts of entering Parliament, but complied because he feltit his duty to doall in his power to assist the Liberal cause aud-to carsv forward that great work which Mx. Dodson had so gallantly commenced. (Cbeers.) He came forward -as a supporter of the general policy ox Lord Palmerston. (Hear, hear.) It seemed to be doubted whether he realy wished to sit in Parliament at. all; but he could assure them that it was his intention to be returned if theybhadcthe willand the -power to return him. (Cheersm) While advocating Liberal views, he would not pledge himself on any measure, but would give his best supportito those which he thoughtwould conduce to the benefit of the country.- H e would support a sound religious education, which he regarded as the basis of that progress for which he was- an -advocate. (Hear, hear.) He was for the towns as well as the country, and, while advocating Liberal measures for the former, he would at the same time relieve those engaged in agriculture from all oppressive taxation. (Hear, hear.) Among other measures relating to the countr;-, he disapproved entirely what 'was called agricultural statistics ; they were inquisitotial, and therefore un-English. (Applausq.) In the matter of chunrchrates he favoured the voluntary principle. (Hear, hear.) Colonel Cavendish repudiated the assertion that he had used Mr. Fuler's age as a reason why he was undeserving of support, though that had often been mentioned by persons whom he had canvassed. He concluded by calling on his supporters to be early at the poll
A snow of hands was then taken, which the returning officer declared to be in favour of MIr. Dodson and Colone. Cavendih.
Mr. M. D. ScoIT demanded a poll on behalf of the other candidates.-
The polling takes place to-morrow.

The election of two nmembers fo this division of the county took p laos- on Saturday'at the, Gufldhall Southamp. ton, before the High Shoriff. Mr. W. C. mHumphrya.
Sir E. HursE proposed the Conservative candidate, the Hon. Ralph HeneageDatton, who was seconded by Captain
Sir J. B. MILL nominated Sir Jervoise Clarke Jervoise, the Liberal candidate, and Mr. T. THISTLzrWrAYTE seconded the nomination,.
There being no other candidate, the IiGH SmvRuB declared both the above-named gentlemen duly elected.
The Hon. R, DuTrow sald that he held moderate Conservtive=iesa but believed it to be' perfectly conslstent for

Social questions would have his pitttculdr attention, and he wouldasupport any comprehensive measure of education which vwas most available for the instruction of all classes of the community. He felt great' interest in local 8elfgovernment as opposed to centralization, believing that local affairs could be best mnanagd by local men, and in confirmation of his views referred to the evils attending the ' worldug of the centralibing system in France. With regard to the income-tax, he did Dot wvsh to see it extended to incomes of 1001. a-year, as it would bear most unduly on per. sons of small means, with larko families to'support and educate. He considereda 'standing arniy to beagreat Bvi bat the navy should be well kept up, and to be prepared for any emergency was the truest ecohomy. ' On the question of the foreign policy of the Government, he said that he knew from experience that the naine of Loid Palmer8ton was known and respect-ed throughout the world, and, had he been a member of the lite Pa,fliament, he should have voted for the Government on the China question. He saw no present necessity for alterig'the frsachise, but should do a8 Lord Palmerston did. He was omposedato the ballot, and In favour of the abolition of cliurchrates as soon as it was practicable.
Sir J. C.

ArGYLtISHIRE.
The election of a6 member for the county of Aranl took PI Olac e Fridayjat the county town of Tinveay. The at. tendanco in this thinly peopled district 'was small, only amounting in all to about 400, of whom 50 electors came from Campbeiltown by the MEountaineer steamer, nan 30 from Strachar.
After the usual formalities-had been gone through,
Mr. -J. FORSYri proposed M1r. Alexander S. minay, of Casste-Toward as member for the county of Argyll; Mr. CAsrBnnLL, of Inverneill, seconded the nomination ; and there being no other candidate, Mr. Finlay was declared to he duly elected.
Mr. FINLAY, who was recived with much cheerin'g expresed his sincere thankrs for the honaour the electors a done him. With read to his poltic~al pricpe,h ad I have from the te myself as a supporter of Lord Palmerston!a Administration, because Icoonsider him as the only man known 'to the public at the present time who is capable of maaintainii a strong and powelrfnj Government. (Loud chee&) shall not, however, go t
Parliament boaund to support Lord Palmerston under all I circumstances ; I shall go free and unfettered to act as I maay consider best for the interests of the nation and of the country, but resolved not to use that freedom forany factious
purposes, (Cheers.) I have great confidence in Lord Palmer-' ston's foreign policy in his great ex perience, firmness, and judgment. In allhi treatib7s withforeig nations he hasin-
variably, upheld the honour of Great Britain, andin none hasI he been mnore successful than i h mottngtain wihRsarespetig Bolgrwd. Theresult of that diplomatic strugle enabled thiscountry to reasp the benefits of aLll our sacrifices in the Russian war, and which a less experienced and less acute Mfinister might have forfeited. Although myr olitical oions are not extreme they are decided. I am Srmly- resolved to suppot the cause of socia and poll. tieal progress It shall always be my first duty to promote ever mesur whch s clcuate toincrease the social happiess o thepeopl. (Ceers.

Many different parties aretuited tooppo the LordAdvocate's Bill, but theywil not unite in bringing forward another more perfect one, and I see no other alternative but to ccept that measure. Although I do not approve the details r atnepared to give It my support. IJf after giving it a fair trl it is found to contain important defiet, they may hereafter b remedied. But by education I donot meanmerely teaching children to read and' write, That system of education will be very imperfect which does not
form not only better seholaz% but better agriculturisbt, betI ter ploughmen, and better labourers One of the most import=nt and difficult of the many duties of Government is
a judicious administration of the finanoes of the nation, and I rigid btt proper economy. I do -ot approve tndiaerimi.j

mo$te ective footing, for there can be no sound economy I where there is not effliciency. (Hear, hear.) The recent inteligenoe from China takes away much of the anxiety whioch 'ha for some timebeez. ooneentrated upon the diptte with that country, for we have now reason to believe 'that badtheEtuiperor of China been a oember ofour Parliament he would have voted with Lord Palmerston.

Sir Edward Colabrooke was nominated by Captain RAar.MTOm, of' Dalziel,kand secvondd by Mr. HounnswomnT, of Coltness. - 1---
Mr. BAnLTE COCHRAsN first addressed the 0&ctors He referred to his Chinese vote, observing that he had r4d (he papers three times over, and could only arrive at the conclusion that the war with Chins was not one that could be carried on with honour to the British flag. He had heard it stated, and sted with very great trath, that the noble lord at tbe head of HerMIlajestys Government was a great war Minister. He admitted that Lord Palmerston did carryon the late war with signal ability and suocess and he concnrred in the opinion that he was the greatest of war Ministers, but that was a very good reason why he hould not'eagood pea oMinister The fact was that r was his natural element, and this explained all his foreign poliy. (Immense uproar.) He heard-the noble lord stae CoMr. Disraeli in thelHouse of Commons the other night," It is trne I et you into scrapes, but at the same time I am no sooner into ascrae than Iam otof it." (Laughter and oheers.) This reminded him of the conversation between a master and his aervant,-" Well, John," said the master "I am no sooner in a passion thn I&m out of it." "Yes, Sir," replied John, "btt you are no sooner out of it than yo are in t agin ." So it was' with the Government.
e were no sooner out of one war than we were in another. (Cheers and disapproation) His conviction was, that intervention in the affairs of other States was calculated to imperil the best interests of the country by leadin4 us into war, and then we could not possibly expect relief from theoheavy taxation npoaed upon us. The expenditure of the country in nearly al its branches must be reduced, or the y could not look forward to the time when they could have relief from the pressare of the incomnetax; but he was sorry to sasy he saw no evidenoe of an economical spirit on the part of the Govemrnent. The hon. gentleman then referrea to the question of education, declared himself to bO a sound Protestant, opposed to the introduotion of forms of worship distasteful to the people, ancl ready to support any form of Protestantism that did not contain within itself the elements of the Roman CAtholic faith.
Sir B. COLunROOxE, who was received with ramch favour, referred at some length to his exertions in favour of the repeal of the corn laws, and to the sarifioes he had made to bring about the completion of that great reform. He had claims, therefore, as one who had borne the heat and burden of the day. He vindicated the course which Her Majest's Government had taken with regardto the affirs of Naples, and charged his opponent with inconsistency on that question, inasmuch as, whale attacking and oondemning the interference of the English and French Govermments in the affairs of Nales, he (Mr. B. Cochrane) had himself remonstrated lwith King Bombs on the existence of abuses. Whst right had he, therefore, to blame the Government for doing that in which be himself had set the example? He (Sir Edward) had been chared with being vague upon the Chinese question, to which charge he certainly did not think hohad laia himself open, because he had plainly stated his opinon that Her Maiesty's Government were quite jnstifiea in the course they had taken u on that question. Sir Edward then referred to r. Cobdensa motionrat length, and denied that the attack upon Canton had been attended with
such losS of are and evils to the Chinese as was souht to be
made out by the supporters of the adverse vote in the late Houase of Commons. He said, in conclusion, that he came forward to fght a battle for the independence of the county andI in defence of the LiberAl principles which he kad always had so much at hea (Cheers.)
Sheriff AImSox having a ked for a show of hands the great majority was held utp for Sir Edward Cole'orooke.

The Bev. Dr. Aton wished to put some questions to tho candidates but was overruled, and, on a vote of thanks being given to Sheriff Allson, the assemblage dispersed.
The nomination for the conty of RoIs took place at DingwAll on Thursday. There was no opposition to Sir James Matheson. The hon. baronet was proposed by Mr. DAviD Muxno and seconded by Mr. CnA}4;s Mm-nso.

SUTHERLANDSE
The nomination took place on Thuday at Dornoch, the county town, when the Marquis of Stafford was returned *without opposition.
lir. JoHN HL, of Sciborcross, moved, and 3r. Gi2r, of Glendhu, seconded the nomination.
The Marquis of STAFFOID, in returning thanks, wYa very cordialy received by a large concourse of electors. He sad, the best account he could give of his stewardship during the short time he had hAd the honour to represent tha county of Sutherland was to refer his constituants to hisvotes. These he felt confident would be found to have been uniformly registered on behalf of the great interests of civil and religious liberty, and always on the sido of progress. It had been his constant aim to vote independently, and, in no one instance in giving an independent vote, bad he done so with greater stisfaction than when voting against the Maynooth bribe. (Cheers.) He had cordially supported the Lord Advocate's Education Bill, believing it to be for lhe good of the countr) and he was ready to support any other measure which, wIno seeking to improve our general system of educion, soght aso to render more efficient the parochial schools of Scotland. He rejoiced in the prosperity of the nation, and hoped that though they had been and still were at loggerheads with China they would soon have a permament and honourable peace. The British army had been triumphant, and the flag of the British navy had never been tarnished. (Cheers.) In looldng forward to the future he should eDdeavour to pursue a liberal and independent course, and give to the Government support only when it appeared to be worthy of it. (Cheers.)

The candidates nominated on Saturday were Sir Charles Coote, Mr. Michael Dunn, Right Hon. C. W. Fitzpatrick, and Mr. Burrow Kelly. The show of hands was in favour of Coote and Fitzpatrick. The other candidates retired.
CAtRLOW (BOnOuGCs).-Mr. John Alexander, in returnIng thanks to his constituents, alluded to one vexed question in terms which must have caused some surprise to those -who set him down as a politician of the old school of Tory. xsm :-" I say that the Maynooth grant," said Mr. Alexander, " now appears to be aprescrptiveright. I think and feol that it now, and has been for years, a prescriptive right, and ought not to be disturbed. I have come to that conclusion more fully because I know this subject is one of deep interest to a large LaMbor of my Roman Catholic friends, and I tell you I am emboldened by the conviction and knowledge that exists among the great miajonity of the Conservative electors of this borough, and that their feelings and expressions are identical with my own. I do not hesitate for a single moment to say that these are my opinions, and I take the Latin quotationto express more fuly my sentiments-stare decisis-' leave matters as they are.' I have never in my seat in the Imperial Parliament voted against the Maynooth grant, and it is not my intention to opposo it so long as Ihave the honour of being your representative. I never recorded a vote that in my judgment could infficttheslightestpainorgivethomallestoffence to any man, no matter how humble, in this country, or to the corununity at large, and I shaU always hope that it never shall be thrown in my teeth again that I have offended any one of you, my fellow-countrymen." The Hon. Captain Ponsonby, the defeated candidate, narrated an anecdote or two which being vouched for as true on the honour of the gallant officer will readily explain why it was that he was left so far behind in his race for the prize:-' When I -was here during my canvass I received earnest and solemn promises from men of respectability, even up to 11 o'clock yesterday; gentlemen, shall I say, who Ithought would have done anything in the world before they would violate their pledges, and they have come up and deliberately broken their promises. I say there is something wrong when that took placo-I do not say that it was bribery that brought that matter about. There are something liko 20 gentlemen who solemnly pledged themselves to give me their sapport, and they
ave clelibertely broken their word, and voted against me. I leave it to those gentlemen to settle this matter with their own conscience. I know deserters in the army are held in contempt by their comrades and despised by the enemy. I hope those gentlemen will be pointed out, and known to every man in the community during the rest of their lives as persons without a particle of principle or honour. (Cheezs.) This is not an atteck on any nan who kept his -word, and conscientiously voted against me. (Hear, hear.) I give them every credit, because they acted honestly and above board. (Cheers.) I had letters and offers from several persons, promising to vote for me if they were bribed. (' h, oh ' and great sensation.) OnegentlemM 5Sfered to vote for me if w would buy a picture fin-him. (Great laughter.) Iam determined to0.D>>sko those letters publio. It may be unpleasant t~Ahc~ parties to do so, but I wish it - to be un.dergod that tt is not against the constituency I
spCi?7 DUt against certain people of this town who broke their word."
DIooiLeEDA.-The conduct of the mob was most disgraceful during the contest. hr. Brodigan, the defeated candidate, served the following notice on the sheriff:-
" Drogheds, April 3. 12 o'clock, noon.

KIT.EINNY (CouNm).-If faith is to be placed in the extreme Roman Cathohio organs there is no longer a chance for Mr. Serjeant Shoe. But three priests, it seems, are favourable to the re-election of the learned serjeant, while all the rest of the reverend fraternity havo ranged them. selves among the supporters of the Hon. Mr. Mostyn, son of Lord Vaux of Harrowden, and the Liberal, Captain John Greene.
MAYO (COuTNTY).-The contest promises to be one of the most exciting of the Irisl counties. It will be a struggle for supremacy between Dr. MacHale, on the one hand, and the gent7, Roman Catholic as well as Protestant, on the other. lho coalition between Colonel Palmer and Mr. George Henry ?ffoore has naturall disgusted mauy of the Conservative electors, and it is said to be probable that the malcontents will throw their influence into the scale with a view of iusuring the return of Colonel Higgins, who, although Roman Catholic and Liberal, has incurred the wrath of the dictator at St. Jarlath's. Air. Higgins's sole offence is his refusal to submit to the leadership of Mr. Moore, and to be dragged tbrough the mire of independent opposition. A meeting of Mr. lHggins's committee was held a fewdays since at Claremorrie, Sir Richard O'Donel presiding, when the following resolation was adopted:-
On attention having been called to a handbM signed ' Goorge Henry Moore,' In which, among other mlistatements, the folowing is mnade -' On the one side aro the great body of the gontlemen, the clergy, aud the people of Mayo ; oU the etherhaind Is confederated the wvho'e of the dishonesty of the county,'
R esoovd,-That the impata3tons convoyed In the 2rst paragraph are false, and In the second false and calumnious. That re have un questionable evidence before us thit Colonel Higgins is warmly supported by a landed proprietary whose rental exceeds L150,00 a-year on a county valuation of about £311,000 per annum, including several peer, a considerable portion of the clergy of both persuasons, nDd numerous Protestants, aud nearly au the Roman Catholic geutry of this county; and we put It to the conaticuency of Mayo whether, iudependent of tee highly respectable names ou our committee, such gentlemen as the Earl of Arran, Visoount Dillon, the Hon. W. Rusell (Dalgan-parki, Valentine O'Connor niaske, YEdward 'blore O'iFarrol
Compten DomvleUo, and many others, are hlkely to confederate with ad
the dishonesty of the county, or whetber there can be a more bese or dishonourablo conspiracy than theheterogeneous opposition now organized to eppoe Coolonel Eiggies's return of 'Moore and Palmer' and I Palmer aud Moore.' I
TIPrERARY (CO UNTY).-The town of Tipperry-al. ready immortalized byits bank-has set up as a rival inbru. tally to Kidderminster. Subjoinedisa greatlycondensed sketch, supplied by a Roman Catholic local journal, of the reception given there on Thursday to Mr. Waldro n and his friends while engaged in an electioneering canvass:-
"After having ha an interview with Dr. Hlowley, Mr. Valdron, with several of his supporters, entered his committee rooms, at Mr. Haye's1 in the Main-street, at about 1
-o'clock. Subsequently, an infuriated rabble, who cheered for Massy, attacked with stones the freeholders of Mr. Waldron, and so desperate and excited were the aots of the canaille, acting, as they asserted, in the interest of Massy, that the voters wvere 4zriven to the necessity of repulsing the maddened rabble, which they did, with hearty good will sau arar ed effect, by ththhe h hillllagh, ,which as rendered necessary, as a matter of selfdefence. The rabbl came to the charge a second time, -and were again repulsed by the voters of Mr. Wal-dron. Eor the third time the mob, fearfuly exasperated, camc to the assult. Paving-stones of a large size flew in 411 directions. Infuriated wvomen carried stones in their aprons, and supplid them to the male portion of the rabble, flo Ilsg ithent with fury and vengeans e at every person they coneived Was opposed to them. All business was entirely ususended in the shops, whioh were rapidly closed, and into several of which many Waldrotites, everowered by the murderous r rabble were obliged to run for shelter, When the streots f,ileA to yield a supply of the dangerous rsLssiles, bAckysrds and other plAces wbere they might be proourod were sarbhed.

ltimately they bad to run from their perilous positior otherwise I am confident they would1h bav bee al
murdered on the anot. Nor did the WaldronUtee who had fled into the 8hops entirely eape the rffianism of the rabble. I saw a young man weaing a blck coat and gr,y cap walk up opposite the door of a shop Into which some waldronites had gone for safety, and the door being opened for a moment, this young man, whose dress I havo described, let dy an immense paving stone in among the persons collected together ia the shop. His example was followed by others. Great astonishment was expressed that the police did not make their appearance to quell the m*ge sooner than they did. When they appeared the disturbance for the time was nearly over; but, as will be peredved from the details wvhich will follow, only to break out again with renewed and increased ferocity. Comparative order having been produced in the street-and I believe the entie riot was confined to the Main-street-the Rev. Mr. Collins. of Bansha, speaking from the windows of Mr. Wildron'a committeerooms, proceeded to address the assembled people but, owing to theinterruptionswhichherewiveafrom sroz of women, boys and butchers, marshalled by wild-looking frantic men, who put out their tong aat the rev, gen tleman, he was obliged to discontinue his speech. Soarcely had the rev. gentleman retired when a volley of stones, flung with the most fearful violence, came bang in through the windows of the commnittee-rooms, aid it wa7s with much diffclty that Father Collins e=cape unhurt frora the disgusting rutali and hideous anism of tIs saguiary rabble. lie hadto lie down onL the door of the committee. room to esca:e being hurt. The streets of the town presented a terrible aspect. Those who were known to have any gym athy with Mr. Waldron were savagely attaoked with stiecs and stones and so systematicay was the affair conducted that it mnust have been previousi organired and sanctioned. Stones, as fast as they coulddb pelted, were hurled In through the commnttee-roorn windows, in which there was scarce ylefta whole pane of glass) and the persons inside narrowly eaped with. their livei."
Suao (BonoUGH).-A petition agairnt the return of Mr Somers is certain. The public may be prepared for extraordinary revelations touching the purity of this immlaculate borough; and all parties, save those posesed of the elective franchise, are looking forward hopefully to the days when Sligo shall be assigned its proper coition in the class of boroughs already erased from the Parlimentary roll by reason of their rank corruption.
WESTAM&TIL.-The journals of independent opposition~ are peaft out notes of triumph at the return of SirRichar
Levmge, the last new Tory convert, and at the retirement of Mr. Pollard-Urquhart, one of the most respectable of the Irish Liberal members in the old Parliament.
Lord Chelsea And The Jews.
LORD CHLSEA AND TaE JTWS.
We are requested to publish the following letter, addressed to Lord Chelsea:-
"My Lord,-I feel that I should apologize for intruding .mpon your time when I know it to be so fully occupied; yet I find it impossible to refrain from addressing you upon a subject of the greatest import sce. I have no words suff. ciently vivid to express my a stonishment at your spoeeh of the 1st of ApriL In that speech, delivered at Edmonton, you stated that 'you had never met a Jew whohadnotdeclaed that if he had tho opportunity of infliting a serions injury upon the Christian faith, or of preventing it spread, he would fail to do so.' I am always unwilling, indood I am quite unable, to doubt the veracity of an EngUsh gentlema n, and therefore I feel anxious to behiove that, in the somewhat bewildering excite. ment of electioneering movements, you were unfortunately betrayed into expressions at varianoe with well. aseertained and universally- acknowEledged facts. The Jows never try to make proselytes. Faithful to their own creed, they do not, either directly or indirectly, endeavour to undermine the religious opinions of o thera. Why should they mako the attempt? They are taught to believethat Almighty God, the fountain of all mercies and of al blessings, judges all human beings according to thoir works, and that the pious and righteous on earth, whatever be their race or faith, may all hope to enter into the kingdom of Heaven That those who profess the Christian religion should endeavourtoumakeconvertsIfuliyunderstad, and,whileIamfirmly convinced that they will not be succossful in winning my coreigionista from the faith of Israel, I candidly confess that I honour the motives and appreciate the exertions of zealous missionaries. They labour indefatigably to diffuse the tenets of their religion, because they believe that there is no salvation out of the pale of their own church. The Jews, however, can have no motive for wishing to make proaelytes; they respoet all zeligions and are truly convinced that a conscientious obedience to the dictates of tho same is not morely compatible with, but pro-eminently pro. ductive of the exercise of the noblest virtues.
I beg, my Lord, to subscribe myself, in all sincerity,

All the above gentlemen were "Blues," and we heartily 'wish that they may do hononr in their future career both to themselves and to the venerablehouse of their early education.
A MISCAIRL&GB OF JUSrCE.-We are continually reminded of the uncertain and anomalous state of English law, and one of the most remarkable ilustrations of that buDgling legislation, which offers a premium to crime, appears in our last. It will be in the recoUlection of our readers that a man named Astin was a short time since charged before the magistrates at Burnley with baving, on the night of the 18th of February, 1857, broken into a cotton mil at Padiham, and with having cat and wantonl destroyed a great quantity of cotton warps and worsted healds and machinery, thereby inflicting damage to the amount of nearly 3001. The evidence agains' the prisoner was very strong, and, after a patient examination, he was committed for trial. On Monday last Astin appeared in the dock of the Crown Court at Liverpool, beforo Baron Martin, in due course, Mr. Edward James, one of the counsel for tho prosecution, opened the case, from which 't appeared that the property thus injured and destroyed belonged to a co-operativo association, registerel according to the provision of the 7th and 8th Victoria, cap. 110, and trading under the title of the Padiham Cotton Leage Company. The prisoner was a shareholder, and had boon in tne employment of the association and discharged, A motive for tho crieao was also suggested. He had several times expressed his animosity towards the le3gue, and given utterance to vague threats against its nnembers. Such aro the facts of the case as they appeared in our colamns a few weeks since, and as sttedW by M1r. James in his address. At tho conclusion of his speech, the learned gentleman proposed to call witnesses in support of his statement, when Baron Martin voluntarily interposed, and stated that the prisoner "was clearly a partner in law, and to that extent an owner of the property, and as such not indictable" undor the only Act applicable to his offence. Astin had engaged two " counasel learnetd in the law"-EMr. Monk and Mr. Eliggin-but they did not raise this objection, They appear to have silently watched the proceedings, but their functions were ably performed bvr the noble judge. Mr. James, moreover, felt that it vas impossible to resist the dictum of the Bench, and, after timidly suggesting that a clause of theJoint. Stock Companies Registration Act, which renders the officers of such companies, being also shareholders, liable to prosecution for embezzlement, might be strained so as to embrace the crime imputed to Astin-a proposition at once negatived by the judge-the learned gentlemaA gave up the struggle, and theorisonerwasdischarged. Weeannot dispute the correctnessof Baron Martin's law. If it rested uponhis single authority the remembrance of more thau one curious decision of his Lordship might load us to question his diotum, but he stated on Monday tbat Mr. Justice Crompton shared his sentiments. All we can thefefore sy is that In this instance, as in many others, a legl defect has frustrated an important criminal inquiry, &d very probably defeated the ends of justlce, The ruling of the. two judges on this northern circuit, wre oaght to addJ holds out a temnptation to crimen by the impunity it offers a body of persons-shareholders in varioas oinmt-stock eompanieif discovered in the perpetration of outrages like that attr. hated to the Padilsam wea-..prearhtt 2 1ehoE saturday.

The Double Murder At Walworth.-The
THE Dounnx MuRIDRAR AT WALWOB -The Solicitor to the Treasury as appointed Mr. Hum. phreys, of the firr of Hnumphreys, Son, and Morgan, to conauct the prosecution of Thomas Fuller Bacon and 31artba Bacan, his wife, at the Central Criminal CoArt next week, for the wilful murder of their children. and azam. munlcation has been received from these gentlemen by the chief clerk at Lumbeth Polioc-ourt, requesting that he wil be in attendance atthe trial with the minute. book containing the statements of Bacon before he was taken into cusody. It will be recolleced that while the case was under investigation, at its early stages, Bacon wasinattendance, and volunteered explanations tothevarious andcontradiatorystatements beh d made tolnspotorYat
and Sergeant Broad, which explanations o$y strent. ened the strong suspicion against himself; but stil these statements were not put into the shaape of depositions or evidence against him, and the Crown, therefore, purpose having them read over and put to the jury in the case. It was the general bellef that the male prisoner would be tried at the same session for the wilful murder of hi
mother, and that, as in the case of Palmer, the proceedings had been moved into the Central Criminal Court; but, from some unaccountable cause, this has not been done. It is sid thaLt, in order to nmove the proceedings from Lincoln to london, it is necessary that an indictment should have been preferred and proved against the acused; but this was neglected at the late assizes for that county, and the pneonr, thereforeg cannot be tried on that charge at the
ld Bailey. Both e and his vife will beput on their trial as before stated, for the murder of their children, and, should Bacon be acquitted on that charge, he wil be detained and ultimately tried on the coroner's warrant at the next Lincoln Assizes.
Wax: PorsoNANG.-On Friday the adjourned inquest upon the bod of Ellen, wife of Edward Hardman, shoemaker, of Botany ba, was reaumed at the Royal Oak Inn, Chorley, beFore M1r. Myres. 3r. Wilson solicitor, attended towatchthe case in behalf of Hardman, who had been confined in gaol sincea the 18th of lMarch. Since his apprehension the body of his wife has been exhumed, a post iiorteka examination made, and the contents of the stomach submitted to chymical analysis by Mr. H. H. Watson, of Bolton, who has detectod both arsenic and antimony in the stomach in sumh quantities as to cause death. Messrs. Pilking. ton and Bamford, surgeons, deposed that they had made a rost swrtem examination of the body of the deeeased, and the appearance of the whole of the stomach and intestines was suoh as that produced by mineral poisons, such as arsenic and antimony. Mr. Gonall, drungist, of Chorley, said that towards the latter end of
ebruary last he sold the prisoner a drachin of tartar emetic.- He did not label the paper In which he placed the powder "Poison," forthe prisoner said he knew all its properties. On the 2d of March prisoner bought half-a-ponund of arsenic from Mr. Critchloy, druggist, Church-streot, Preston. He gave his proper name, but stated that he resided at Bamber-bridge, and that he wanted the arsenic to kill bugs with. For some time before this the prisoner's wife had been very ill. Her father, William solder, of Botany, was sent for, and he called in Mr. Smith, surgeon, to attend her. On the 5th of March she continned unwell, and was often very sick and much purged. Prisoner again fetched his father-in-law, who on ariving at his daughter's house found her very sick. He again sent for Mr. Smith, who, after visiting the dece.cd, requested the prisoner to fetchsome medicine fromhissurnery. 1risonerdid so,and on his return home administe a powder to her, which several witneses proved was of a darker colour than that produced at the inquest by Mr. Smith, as a smilar powder to that he had iven the prisoner. After that he became worse, and died in intense pain the ameda. A witness wbo was employed to lean prisoner' house on tho 5th of March found a small package of powder, supposed to be arsenii, from the fact that after she had tasted it her mouth was a little burnt and parched. Sbe than threw it into the fire. A great deal of evidenco having been adduced the coroner summed up, and the jury retired for about ton minutes. On their return tho foreman annonnoea that the jury thad found a verdict of " Wilful Murder" against
dwrard Hardman, by the administration of poison. The prisoner heard the verdict without appearing in the slight. est degree moved, and was committed upon the coroner's warrant for trial at the Laicaster assizes. He is a man about 30 years old, and issaid to be anotorious chanscter,

LONDONV, MO2LDAY, Ap G, 1857.
The more we study the history of the past or observe the events of our own times the more we perceive how slow are the changes which take place in the habits, policy, or instincts of nations. Evehthe great French Reevolution is now declared not to have suddenly altered the conatitution of the society amid which it raged. Much that seemx due to the eventa of a single epoch had been. growing up for a generation before. But there ix no need to go further back than the events of the late war I How littlo apparent change has there been in the social institutions of the Ottoman State I Turks and Christians keep the xame relative positions, and for many a year there will b4e no uign that the supremacy of race over race hi,
been condemned by Europe and is de3tined to paas away. Ye twe may believe that the Turkis empire is impregnated with principles whieh muut even-s tully- lead to. tho eonsummation for 'hich e fought. Littls.i outWar* changed, but the ee& i* aown which ione dyto g up and liifj fruit. It is to the Ru=a` emnpiread its Mjw policy that we would apply this reasoning. PWoi
not unnaturally ask what will be the future oonk4
'ion of the vast dominions which stretch in a co>tinuous belt over three continents What has b:eeome of the policy of PED5R the GREAT, OATrnEunm, an xcHoLA.ss? hii dead, ordoes it sleep? Eow far is there any truth in the professions of a desire for peace and a wish to grow great by material improvement? Are the Russians deceiving us or 'themselves, or in a measure both, by this lan*guage ? Can the Czars extricate their policy from 'de groove in which it has been fixed by the spirit of the people, and by a succession of able and high-handed Sovereigns f The answers to theae ,questions will be given by time, and it may seem ,presumptuous to anitcipate experience; but, as 'practical politics arb a science concerned with the future, we must endeavour to divine from appear. ances what chance there is of any fundamental ,change in the policy of the Muscovite empire.
T1here can be no doubt that the old system has 'eceived a violent shock. For the irst time in listory the Pussian frontier has receded, and the Turks have won back a portion of their lost terri*tory. The glory of CATHERINE and SUWARROW iS tarnished by the surrender of Ismail; the chelished policy of AlEXANDE:R and NIcHOLAs is swept a"way by the defection of Austiia and 'the hostility of E:ngland. We cannot doubt 'hat throughout the empire there are deep -disappointment, mortification, and distrust. That wvhich was thought irresistible has been over-come, that which was thoughtc eternal in solidity lias fallen. It is quite posBible, therefore, that -even in the minds of Ministers and Generals there imay be a conviction of the necessity of some .chbnge-a change of policy, though not of purpose. 'The laws of political economy are the same in all lands, and independent of either despotism or demo-craey. If they are violated, wealth is accumulated nelowly or not at all; population makes little advance, even knowledge is circumscribed, and the 'vell-being of the people cramped. But wealth, a mnumnerous population, and a fair stock of inteligence in the individual are found at the present ,day to be necessary even for war. It seems, there-fore, natural to suppose that astute men, such as -advise the new CzAn, should recognize what is plain to all the rest of the world. We hear, conazequently, without surprise that the rulers of Ruwsia think the time is come for some reJaxation in the system of the late EMrPEROR. What that system was and what it led to are known to all. NiCHOLAS isolated his empire, and strove to ,erect irresistible power on the basis of fanatical nationality. To a certain extent he succeeded, in,asmuch as he fused the discordant (German and 'Muscovite races into someth:ng approaching to lunity. But in every other way he weakened his /people and retarded their progress, so that, though hbe lived only to prepare for war, when war came <he was conquered for the want of appliances -which are the result of peace.
The advisers of the present CzAR may therefore 2be willing to try experiments to which the invinecible obstinacy of his father would never have yielded. Evidently the two great objects of a dRussiau statesman, if he be as wise as we of the West are apt to fancy him, must be to invite -foreign capital and to disarm foreign jealousy. 'Russia is powverless for the present because she is -poor and suspected; let her have the means of a great war and the reputation of desiring only peace, and there will be a chance for her winaing baclc what she has lost, and something more. Hence the plans for a system of railwvays, for a fleet of steamers, for extended commerce, and freeer intercourse with the world. Hence, too, the promise of a milder administration in Poland. Europe has for the last 40 years been prodigal in symnpathy for what are called unfortunate .nations. The whole continent used to talk over 'the supposed wrrongs of Ireland, and the cruelty of her merciless sister. Hungary and Italy have received equal and more merited compassion; but Poland, above every other nation, has been pitied and promised assistance, which never came. The rule of the late CZAR was the tyranny of a man who had determined on a great object. He wished -to Russianize the country, and during the 23 years which elapsed between the rebellion and his death lie never lost sig'nt of this aim. By proscribing the Polish history and traditions, and as far as j2ossible the Polish language; by forcing the Polish youth into the Russian service, by proclaiming the absolute incorporation of Poland with the empire and abolishing the Custom-houses of the frontier, he in less than the lifetime of a generation almost succeeded in doing what it ordinarily takes ages to effect. The demonstrations of the French Chambors or the speeches of English philanthropists were not likely to move such a man, He kept steadily to his purpose, and tho terrible policy of -conversion and transformation ceased only with his life.
But it is said that the present CZAR iS in favour *of a new system, or wants the iron courage to maintain the old. It is certa;n that the rigour of the Government has been much rel%xed, and freedom of travelling, of speech, and of trade has been given to the Poles. The Russians appear to think, and perIrps aro not in the wrong, that the possibility of
1n independent Poland has passed away, and that the Poles know it. Perhaps the hope, or even the wish, for a separate nationality suirvives only in the trusting hearts of refugees, who do not know what has been passiDg at home during their long term of exile. It would seem that the Poles, like the rest of the world, are finding a solace for the want of liberty in the acquisition of wealth. The Russian Government takes advantage of this modern tendency, While the Church regains its old jurisdiction and the prisons are emptied by liberal amnesties, the commercial interests of tbe nation are not forgotten, and Poland is represented in the commission sitting at St. Petersburg for tho reform of tariffs and the extension of commercial freedom. As Poland is the only part of the empire which is in contact with really ivilized countries, and as the railway system of Central Etirope will bring Warsaw within a fewv hours of tbe Western capitals, this abandonment of the policy of isolation shows something like confidence in the Russian Cabinet. ALEXANDER
and his Ministers must count much on the identification of the two countries, when we find them willing to allow Poland, the classic land of misfortune, to associate with foreign States which have for years set no bounds to their indignation at her wrongs. The relaxation of the WYarsaw Government is an instance of the change which we conceive to be taking place iu the Russian empire. There are the governors-and the governed. Everywhere the people are seeking to rise into something higher, togetalittle knowledge, to earn a littlemoney, *and to naturalize some of the appliances of Western civilization. However warlike a race msy be, private interests are, after all, most constantly present to
them, and the Russian, the Pole, and the German are equally anxious to gain something which they have not, and which they know that more favoured nations possess. On tha other hand, the Government may be, as hitherto, intent on war and conquest, but it feels that it must change its ceurse, and that it can only hope for future successes by laying a solid foundation of material prosperity at -home. We cannot doubt, therefore, that the -policy of St. Petersburg will, for some time to -come, side-with the instincts of the people, and be -directed to develope the resources of the country. If the CzAR hope! to use this prosperity hereafter -fS a means of zggesion, we may well believe that he will be deceived. The age of get conquests in war bas pased, and whether a ruler checkl the
progress of his people or enconrage it he will probably find himself equally unable to gratify a dangerous amnbition. In the firsb oase his people have not the power, in the second they have lost the inclination, to realize his schemes.
If there lay no deeper meaning in the present
If there lay no deeper meaning in the preeent electoral contest than the solution of a difficulty between a Minister and a fortuitous conjunction of parties, even the results as yet ascertained show clearly enough on which side lies the balance of public opinion. As was said of the great Lord CH TrHA3 it may be said of Lord PALME1STOT, that he is " the MIinister of brave men." Now, despite the placid purrings of the Peace Society -despite the pi4otic Qfl9rt mde by some of our most eminent orators to convince us that in a,ny dispute between England and any foreign country England necessarily enacts the part of the buly and the ruffian, and that wars would die out were not Englishmen ever fumbling with the gate of JAus's Temple, and expending their breath in blowing np the ashes of discord,-it weems it-is impossible to bring the country to this, way bf thinking. Neither from the counties nor from the boroughs has the self-accusing cry of "Z Nosrd " culpt" been heard to any noticeable extent. Tho verdict, then, just delivered by the country in favour of Lord PALMMsnSTON-as far as it is merely a verdict in his favour-is, that he is not guilty of the charges brought against him by the various political Free Lances who, by their temporary accord, constituted the late Chinese majority. This affair, then, is one which has been absolutelY disposed of. The country has set aside the finding of the House of Commons. No matter what accidents may intervene, no matter who may remain in power or who may come into power, this Chinese question will receive the only solution which was ever possible,-one which shaJl no longer leave' the lives of British subjects or the interests of British merchauts at the mercy of the first capricious barbarian who may be pleased to attack the one or injure the other. But has the decision of the constituencies, and more especiaUy of the counties, no deeper significance than this, which is one of so patent and transitory a character? We think it has.. 'Under a sane and normal condition of the House of Commons the leader of a powerful and well-organized Opposition wouId never have taken issue upon a point so frivolous in one sense, and in another so deeply interesting to the dignity and national feeling of Englishmen, as the propriety of trailing the British flag through the mud of the Canton river. The division upon Mr. CoBDn's motion was tainted with every defect which can be attributed to a party manceuvre. It was in contradiction to the obvious feeling, not only of the coWnstituencies, but of the country in general; it was factious, it was premature. It is, however, but a shortsighted view of the subject not to attribute a more pregnant meaning to the recent returns, and more especially to the returns from the countie The true, explanation appears to be somewhat as follows:-
From the day on which the Corn PiU received the Royal assent until the outbreak of the Russian war, ahid fiom the conclusion of the Russian war until the vote of the other day upon the Canton business, the Conservatives have not known what they were fighting about, or, indeed, if they were fighting at all. They had not a watchword nor a war-cry. Theyhad neitherfaithinnorrespect for their leaders. They occupied their usual places rather because those places were opposite to those on which were seated the politicians whom they had been in the habit of regarding as their antagonists than for any more satisfactory reason. Then there was the Peelite section of the Housethe AxANDEi's Generals,-Very capable men, who represented nothing, however, save their own appetencles for office. After these we had the League party, with their cuckoo-note of " Peace, " peace," and with their general desire to embarrass everybody who had not cast in his lot with their own narrow sciolism. The country fully appreciated the fact that no public interest was bound up with the pale ghost of Protection, nor with Mr. GLADsronr,'s rhetorical flourishes, nor with Mr. COBDE's tirades against every proposal which did not emanate fromn what, as it has since appeared, was falsely called the Manchester School. One man, indeed-and that man was Lord Josis RUsssEL-might have consolidated the Liberal Party, and by the consolidation of the Liberal Party have given life and reality to an Opposition; but he threw his great opportunities away like a capricious child. He neither brought forward good measures nor concilisted men of ability and influence in the House. IHe disappointed and disgusted the Liberal Party, and frittered away his own reputation. Now, we say that the further prolongation of such a state of things as had been thus produced in the House of Commons was felt by the country to be intolerable.. The constituencies were sick of shams. The Conservative Party was obviously not felt to be a reality, and has accordingly received a severe check. Messrs. COBDEN, BIG}xT, GIBsoN, &c., were not esteemed realities-they have been sent bodily about their business. The Peelites have met with but a very questionable reception from the country. Some have been turned adrift altogether. The stronger swimmners-as Messrs. GLADSTON'E, InIZBERT, and Sir JAntEs GRAHAAT- are clutching here and there in desperation for some support from above or standing-groumd from below.
The change in the county representation, however, is perhaps the most remarkable event" in the late election. The smash of the Leaguers and Peelites was an event to be expected, but we could scarcely have anticipated that the counties wo-uld go over in such large proportion to the side of the House on which realities are to be found. The loss to the Ministerial side by the returns as yet received-we do not speak of the Irish counties-appears confined to North Rants, where Mr. SOLATEE: takes the place of Mr. S. LEEzE V, who is to be caled up to the House of Peors. Az against this unit of loss we find that there is a gain in no less than 23 counties, only two of which, Ayrshire and Clackmannan, are Scotch. This result, as we believe, has a much deeper significance than a mere vote of confidence in a popular Minister dpon one point of foreign policy. It is an effoit on the part of the country to elect a House of Commons which shall be something
and mean something. It remains to be seen if Lord PALMERSTON will have the same vigour in his domestic as in his foreign policy. At the present moment he is master of the situation, although Lord Jons Russnan is waiting for him with a Reform Bill, and Sir JA=s GRAsrnr is waiting for Lord Jonx, and the very Conservative leaders have proclaimed their earnest desire for a hybrid something which is to mean Retrogression and to be called Progress. Thus much appears to be proved-that the counties will no longer tolerate the shallow impostures of the last 10 years. For 10 years the Grecian League lay before Troy; but then there was Troy, and it was their business to take it. For 10 years the Conservatives have been doing nothing but bewailing Protection and babbling of Maynooth. Surely it is hard to keep. a political party togetber on such fare.
On Monday, the 19th of January last, the
On o£onday, tb 19th of Jaauu laut, the American vessI 3hmf L. Bogart was lying ih the Merney, on the. thieii aide ot tlxe 4Uram, pre.
paratory to her homeward pauage. Her cptina h,ad been two or three days away, lier chief mate, I 1linEa, and seOnd mate, CA"BZ, nglet
charge. After breaa;fast in the moming, *ihen the hands were mustered and set to work by the-boatswain, two seamen who had recently come on board, named CRruArs V DERpOL and JTA S CbEYSen, declined to work, alleging that they had been brought to the wrong ship, and refusing the service. No sooner was this resixtance offered than the mates armed themaldves with revolvers, and fired deliberately and repeatly at CniuYSTaE as he ran away from them about the deck. The shots seem to have alarmed the whole crew, 17 in number, ana to have diven them into commor cause with the remonstrants, for they presently all gathered on the forecastle together, and passively made a kind of head againstthematee. Upon this, these officers took stand opposite, with their pistols, and, after challenging the men in vain to come down, actually. fired three rounds right among them as they Ftood. How it happened that more execution ws not done under suchl circumstances we can har4Ily imagine, but at last a shot from the second-mate took effect, and a ball was lodged in Cinis=6riR thigh. The chief mate then gave chawe to a mau named J.oNEs, who, after being shot at, turned upon his pursuer and felled him to the deck with a handspike. Meantime the steward of the vessel and the pilot ran up a signal of distress, which brought a police-offlcer on board; the crew were all .given iato custody on a charge of mutiny, and -CRysm and FunnER were cairied off to the hospital tDgether. The chief mate- appeara to hive dide, but CEmysTrs's wound was not fatal, and on Friday last PETEB. Casrnu was put on his trial for the offence before Mi&. Baron WATso;x at Chester. The evidence of the deed was overwhelming. The sailors ddposed to the firing of the shot; the police-oficer to the production by the prisoner himself of -the pistol, with three of its barrels discharged; and the surgeon of the hospital to the lodgment of the bullet in the thigh of the proseeutor,-where, indeed, for that matter, it still remained. The only question concemned the character to be given to the offence, but after some deliberation the jury found the prisoner GuiZty upon the count of intending grievous bodily harm, and the Judge sentenced him to transportation for life.
It appears almost incredible that such a murderous affair as this should have been got up, as it were, at a minute'snotice, in -a British river, and in broad daylight; nor will ti astonishment of our readers be lessene4 when Xwe add that the sentence seems to ha.ve tiken tho prisoner by surprise, as something unexpectedly severe. The fact is, however, that more than one element of recklessness went to the production of this affray. Of these the first and most powerful is genenteKd by the incidents of the merchant service generally. Whether it be from any still unimpaired traditions of barbarous times, whether from the necessary coneentration of power in the hands of a single and often half-educated individual, whether from the general character of the men who take to sea service, or from all these causes and others coinbined, certain it is that the worst and moat inhuman tyranny now practised upon earth appears to be in merchant vessels at sea. Every reader of these coumns will be able to recollect cases of the most revolting cruelty-of cruelty surpassing anything that has been related of Asiatic or African despotism, while the difficulty of obtaining unbiassed testimony and of ascertaining facts with the precision required in a British Court of Justice too often leads to the partial if not complete impunity of the guilty. Even in a case like this before us, open and recldess as was the violence employed, it is possible enough that the crinme might have escaped unpunished had it been committed at sea. It certainly does appear, and we shall presently give some explanation of the faet, that these barbarities prevail to a greater and more shocking extent in American ships than in those of our own country, but even the British merchant service is so far disgraced by them that we eannot possibly affect innocence while denouncing the offences of others.
The excesses of the Americans in these respects arise, we believe, from peculiarities of their national character operating in two or three ways at once; and it is here that we must look for the second elemeut of that frightful reaklesmess exhibited on board the James L. Bogart. Merchant ships are badly ruled almost everywhere, but worst of all in the service between America and England.
American, notwithstanding their aptitude for the. sea, do not like shipping themselves as ordinary working seamen. They take naturally enough to a seafaring life in fishing, whaling, or what not, and turn out as hardy a set of mariners as any in the world, but they always prefer to retain such a share in the ownership of the vessel or the venture she is bound upon as will give them indivi-. dually a species of command or independence. The natural consequence is, that there are not many bidders for a service unprovided with these attractions; and much difficulty, in fact, is experienced in getting some of the Atlantic packetships manned at all. Not only are the worst arts of the crimping trade brought into play, but men are actually kidnapped and carried off, either by delusion or force, to find themselves bound to the voyage against their will. Of course, such a state of things tends, by direct reaction, to make the condition of the service worse than ever. With sulkiness, vindictiveness, or insubordination common among the crews, it is but natural to look for suspicion, violence, and brutality among the officers; and if to these circumstances we add the recklessness of American character, the habitual employment of deadly weapons in ordinary conflict, and the contempt entertained for the negro raco, to which many of these seamen belong, we shall obtain probably a fair comprehension of the feelings which induced a couple of mates on such insufficient provocation, and within hail of the land, to resort to proceedings which wouild never be dreamt of aboard a man-of-war even in a mutiny on the high seas.
The extent to which these atrocities have been
carried in the particular service between the United States and Liverpool is so terrible that it has actually engaged the attention of a benevolent society in the latter place, which occupies itself with the relief of " Foreigners in Distress." Even the statistics of these miseries have been published, and, if any reader's mind should be more impressible by figures than by facts, he may understand that in the 13 months ending with January last the cases of no fewer than 106 seamen were investigated, and with results showing that out of this number 69 had been kidnapped, while 82 were in need of medical treatment from the sufferinga they had undergone. It is to be hoped that the example so very justly made by Mr. Baron WATSON and the Chester jury may have its effect in deterring futoe offenders, and in improving the condition of those unfortunate mnen whom necessity or diaster may have subjected to such risks. The Americans themselves, as their own journalh show, are fully cognizant of the shocldng excemses prevailirg ; nor can so shrewd a people be unawaTe that service rendered under such conditions must alwqy be bad aervice. We, as before confessed, hav.e our own- faults too,-bad enough in all cmsn4cienoe,. even.if not quite so bad as those of tothers; and in these days of enlightereent and vublicty it wil be Qlydy -it humanty and
ccoiiomy iogether cannot nake6aeb idves hed in bringing about reform.
Precautions have at length been taken against
Precantions-have at length been taken Lgainst the introduction into England of the infMecO'Us dieas which is destroying the cattle of theB3alji
countries. An Order in Council was published oni Saturday prohibiting the-importation of cattle, or of horns, hoofs, hides, or sklis, from those ter-. tories of Russia, Prussis, or M1ecklenburg Schweorin which lie on the Gulf of Finland, or between the Gulf and the city of Lubeck. It cannot be said that this prohibition in too, stringent,, or comes too early. Certainly an order which limits the supply of human food. is a strong nieature, but the case admitted neither of compromise nor delay. It was necessary to exclude rigidly and at once anything wbich coidd bring on the country so terrible a calamity as a morality among the, animals used for food. The diwease which has necessitated these precautions has ravaged Sieila, Mecklenburg, and part of Holstein. 'or two or three years, and has latterly assumed a type so deadly as. to rouse the apprehension of the principal Governments of the Continenit. The Governmnents of France, Prussia, and some of t'hc smaller. Gernan States have already mnrde regulations for the exclusion of the tainted cattle, oi any part of. their carcases. Our inslar position gives us greater chance of immunity, but does niot fre s from the necessity of taking some precautions.
The exclusion of cattle coming from Baltic ports will, no doubt, tend to raise in some degree the price of meat, but this evil is not for a moment to be balanced against the deliverance from the scourge of murrain within these islands. The importations from abroad, though - they sedm large in returns, form but a very small part of the supply n.ecessary for the population. England and Ireland are preoeminently grazing' countries ;.th.
meat they produce is far sperior to that of the Continent, and the quantity beyond all comparison greater than anything that the German ports can furnish. Fn fact, this country is, after all, mainly suppliedby theproduce of its own territory. It 's therefore sound economy'to take any steps which may tend to preeerve our ierds, and floclks untainted. Temporary deamness of meat,. of leather, or of tallow, is but a small evil compared with the 'introduction of a 'malady which nmay sweep off thousands of our cattle, from Hampshire to the Highiands, and perhaps, after ravaging the country for years together, end by permatiently deteriorating the various breeds. In our damp climate, where a large supply of animal food is necessary for keeping up health and strength, the consequences of such a calamity as a general destructiox of animals can hardly be contemplated without the deepest apprehension. 'No such' ev'ent has happened in our own day, or even in the present age, biit' m former times such disasters were far frora uncommon, and in. Ithe la3t century. Europe was more than once swept by murrains which destroyedthe animalfood of entirenations. Wethink, therefore, that the Government has only done its duty in prohibiting all importations from the in: fected districts.
But there is probably more to be done than merely to search Baltic traders for cattle or hideg. This disease, no doubt, has its causes and its cure, like those of human kind. The words " infectious" and " contagious" are very loosely used. It is probable that this ' malady is propagated chiefly where the state of the animals is generaly unhealthy, or where, through want of proper care, or through insufficient food or shelter, zheir plysical condition is weak. We may further assume that a disease of this sort is epidemic, and likely to, break out in more than one place, without any intercommninication. Both these considerations point' to the necessity otincrie&UL in 'th" treatment of cattle at hoine. It is nIot'-im. possible that the disease &rises from natural causes, and cannot be averted solely by quarantine regulations. No doubt, infection from abroad would cause it to assume a still more deadly form, but yet the seed may be already sown among' us, and favourable circumstances may cause it to take the dimensions of a great national calamity. Our agriculturists and breeders should therefore take their precautions in time. While Government is watching the outports, they should do all that scienee can suggest to stop the progress of the disease, or remove the causes which may lead to its appearance. If the crowding of cattle-sheds and the want of ventilation and cleanliness have a tendency to encourage the epidemic, as certainly seemns likely enough, no time shouald be lost in remedying defects which may be productive of such incalculable eviL

One or two more such agriculturalseasons and the emand for railway com r,unication would be loud aLnd long-from onke extreme of the colony to the other. The pressure or ans improved system of communicationRs already, indee,a beginning to make itself felt.

One fac, however, which has, bee estuablished by tho remaekabe ediversity in the seasons is that in this colony the farmer munst niot look to the p reduce of his farm mnerely as a weans of subsistence. To be succsful the agriculturist must he sufficiently independent to be capable of occasionally hoarding the produce o one lear for the market of the. next. If he does not act thus, it is quite evident that he wmll not be tre to hirself. Indeed, the interests of the oountry, not sucthan the interes of the individual demand the exercisn ofrsome management ofPthiss ort. Ifthe farmer
elU his wheat one par for 4s. a-bushel, and the next year, when the price is 2ay, haspnone to sell, it is evident that agricultdur wouldo &UL come ton Bstandstill.

Sir.-The letter of Sir John Davis on the China affair which appeared in your columns the other day, expressd the opinion of evety one in this couutry well informed om the subject. What is thought of the matter in China, I thinl4 appeara from the subjoined pasgraph taken from i letter I received by the laat mail from Mr. Morrison, at A&moy. It reads so like a remark on the recent debate, that one can hardly believe the date and address genuine. Ta prevent your scepticism, however, I enclose the origial letter, hurriedly written as you ee, *t the moment of the; departure of the maiL

"Lord Palmerston understands China, and cannot be at much loss wbat to do in this crisis; but the events at Canton and o3ngkong shonld enlighten tbe public as to, what the Chinese are, and show them that they cannot be negotiated with exactly like a civilized State, and saso how very patient we have long been; furthermore, that it is full time to rectify our position towards the country so as to secure, as well as to promote, the immense trad yielding ao great a revenue.

A portion of the folowing appeared La our awnd t*a of Saturday:-1
PARIS, ApRIL 3, 6 P.M.
The Conference on the Neuchatel question held another sitting to-day at the Foreign-office.
The Council of State decided yesterday by a large majority-the minority was only four-that the Bishop of Mloulins had committed an abuse of authority. The decision was come to onthese groun
his uncalled-for suspension of certain clergymen, publication of synodal statutes contrary to law, and a general infraction of the concordat which subsists between France and the Holy See. One Councillor of State, M. Corundet, defended the conduct of the Bishop in very strong terms, and proposed that a new concordat should be concluded, no doubt partaking more of an Ultramontane character than the present, something that would reduce France to the utter dependence on Rome in which Austria is held. The moment is not hap-
ily chosen. It cannot be alleged that the Council of State has acted hastily or ignorantly in the matter. It has now been for a considerable time occupied with this affair. The Bishop has furnished all the explan;ations he could, and,. as I - have previously mentioned, he declined to recognize
the authority of that body. Proofs of the despotic
and illegal conduct of the prelate have been amply i supplied; and the Prefect of the department (AlMer) in which the diocese is situate has declared that so strong was the feeling of the population against him, and o great the excitment, that had he appeared in public after the affair of the Cure of St. Nicholas he would have been insulted, and pr6bably handled very roughly. The decision of the Council will not fail to give satisfaction to the general body of the Imperial clergy, who req%ure to be supported against such excems of authority. These are protected by the same law which protects their superiors, and, legally, the cure can no more be removed from his living at the caprice of a Bishop than the Bishop can by the Minister of.Public Instruction. The finding of the Council of State will be communicated to the Court of Rome. As it is not possible that a man so unpopular with both clergy and laity as M. de Dreux Breze is can perform his duties satisfactorily to himself or to them, he will be superseded by means of a coadjutor bishop if he does not tonder his resignation.
A letter from Vienna, of the 3Let of March, an, nounces that General Count Marziani, who commanded the Austrian troops in Wallachia, has been named Governor-General of Transylvania and the Bukovina. The General, who was expected soon at Vienna, was to leave withoLut delay for his post, in order to receive the Emperor on his visit to Transylvania in May.
Admiral Paniatin, of the Russian navy, has arrived in Paris. A considerable number of gussian naval officers is shortly expected to meet the Grand Duke Constantine.
General Todtleben arrived yesterday in Paris, and alighted at the Hotel du Louvre.
A private letter from Macao of the 15th of February states that the Catinat, which had been sent in search of the men of the French ship Anais, has completed her object. The body of the com-
andor, Cavignac, wrhich was found near Breakers Point, had been interred by the officers of the corYette; the French sailors had been nearly aU recovered, and there were hopes that the others wou'd be saved. The Chinese who were the instigators of the p lot, and who were pointed out as the, assassins of Captain Canignac, were arrested, and were to be tried by a court-martial on beard the Virginie.

A private letter from the Indian Seas, published in the Moniteur de lI Flotte, announces that the King of Siam, in order to carry into execution the treaties concluded between him and several Euiropean nations, had published the following edict:-
" We, Sovereign of the country of Siam, the States of Laos, of Cambodia, of Malacca, and of T)joukseylon, wishing that the treaties we have concluded with the powerfal nations of Europe-France, England, and Russia-may be executed in all their terms, communicate these conventions to the knovwledge of the governors of our pronvnces, officers of Custom", and all our subjects.

Sardinian Cabinet has deored tliat the cessation of the, diplomat-l relations shall neither interrupt the infer. course of Austrian subjects with Sardinia nor be prejudicial to thle rights of the same. In the offlohl communicatIon involved in this question the grievancea of Austria against Sardinia were net touched on. Under present circumstanoes, the Imperial Royal Government will await the coufse of events. It mast seen be known whether the Sardinsiai Government will endea.
vour to establish better and more neighbourly relations, or whether it will add new grievances to those already existiltg.>
The Hungarian party in tis city is rauehdejected, because it is awaro of what took DIScO at a Cabinet Council wvbch was held about 10 ;aj ago. The 1nperor, who presided, most positavely stated that it was not his intention to make any chances, either in the form of governmoet4or in th political division of H . The uar be lieved that a ver extensive sphere of action would be granted to the "representation" of the countr, and that the TemeschBanat and Bervian oivodina would again for a prt of thie kingdom, but they re liow aware that they have deceived themselves. A general amunety Will be granted, real grievances redrewed, andl perhaps some taxes remitted, but the principle of the unity of fhe empire will be most rigidly mainti.ined. A'person. who is well aware of wht is pashg in the Lomnbardo-Venetian Kngdom. has glven me some curious information. The Archduke was in such ahurryto get rid of the persons who represented the Home Deparhnent that he took the affairs out of their hands before the members of his newly-for4ed bureau had obtained a proper knowledge of the usual course of business, and the consequence of his precipitancy was that the chief of Mis Cabinet was obliged to borrow two or tbree exp'erienoed Gov'ernment clerks from Verona. The Mlnitter of the Interior and the military .authorities in the LombardoVenetian Kingdom were on the coolest possible terms while the former was there, and the latter ared. lighted that the new Governor-General will address himself directly to the Emperor instead. of to j:iih Ministers. The Grand Duke of Tuscan=y h
"for the present" declined. to conclude with the Papal C.hair a concorat like the Austrian. Tho
ing of Naples positively refuses: to give I6mnda documental right to infringe on his Sovereignrights5 bult he assures His Holiness t hat the Chuxich hasa 'no more faithful Bon than himself, -and none nore willing to make voluntary concessions; to her. The fact La, that King Ferdinand.shows as bold afront to Rome and Austria as he does to England and France.
The most remarkable news of the day; i, that Count Wimpifen, a Protestant, has been made commander of the 1st Army, which occupies the provinces of Upper anld Lower Austria, }Bohemia, Moravia, and Styria. The 1st Army,which icomposed of four corps, has its head-quarters in this city. General Prince Felix Jablonowsky, who had the command of a division, has been appointed " Aye" or governor to the Archduke Louiis Joseph, the youngest brother of the Emperor.

The Jesuit Yolksfreimd, which is publishing a series of articles entitled " Church and State in France," declares that the affiir of the Bishop of Moulins " is the prelude to the great battle which is about to be fought for the emancipation of the Church from the fetters of the organic articles (organische artiWcel)."

TURIN, MARic 3L
In its late sittings the Chamber of Deputies has been occupied in discussing a Bill for the recon etruction of the Jewish congregations, which comprise some thousands of persons in 10 or 12 towns of Piedmont.
Previous to I848 the Jews were c:cludcdfromnall civil or political rights, and subjected to the most arbitrary treatment. They were only permitted to inhabit a certain quarter of the town (the Ghetto), and were even obliged to carrya piece of yellow riband on their coats as a distinguiihing mark. In 1847, when the reform movement commenced, the emancipation of the Jews was one of the first things thought of. All parties were agreediu these liberal tendencies, andthe civil and political emancipation of, the Jews was one of the first of the wise and liberal acts of Charles Albert. The Israelites then obtained the common rights of citizenship) but, as regarded the public exercise of their religion and its relation 'with the State, they still remained subject to the old laws and regulations. Their congregations or universities were constituted corporate bodies so long ago as 1806 by an ordinance of the Emperor Napoleon. These laws and regulations had, however, become superannuated. On the one hand, they interfered with the Jews in the exercise of their religion and rights, and on the other they did not put them in possession of power for meoting the general wants of their worship and religious instruction. A great many complaints on this subject have from time to time been forwarded to Government from different towns and recently all the congregations sent deputies to 1Varcelli, where a general assembly was held, which drew up a petition to Government setting forth the demands of the Jewish population regarding the reconstruction of their congregations; and, in compliance with the wishes of this assembly, the Government has now framed a Bill on the most liberal basis for regulating the exercise of their religion and determining their relations with the State.
Accordihg to this Bill, all Jewish congregations composed of persons residing In the same commune
rill form separate corporate bodies. They wilI thereforc be invested with certain privileges, and have the right of holding property. They will be governed by Councils of Adntration elected by the whole of the ratepayers. The Councils will be charged with arrangmg the general expenses of religion and administration. The expenses will be divided among the members of the congregation according to their position, their pr6fessions, and their means. The poor-those who do not pay any direct tax to the State-will be exempt from all charge. The Rabbis are to be elected by the votes of the ratepayers.
The Bill encountered some opposition from those who would have liked to see full and entire liberty granted in aUl matters of religion. It must be remembered, however, that there is a dominant religion here, tuat the-Jews themselves asked to be legislated for, aid that if the old laws had been repealed without making new ones the Jews would have been left, as regards the relation of their religion to the State, in a sate of anarchy. The law, moreover, rests on the most liberal bas, that of
election, and any one who does not wish to contribute to the public worship on acoount of his little faith need only declare that he doed not belong to the Jewish congregation, so that liberty of con-
science is perfectly respected by it. The House therefore finally expressed its approbation of the Ministerial measure by a majority of 29-i.e. 76 to 41. At the conclusion of this debate an incident occurred which deserves mention.
You are aware that civil marriage has not yet been made legal in this country-that the registers of the civil states are still in the hands of the priests, the Protestant ministers and the Rabbis. Well, this being the case, M. Valerlo asked the Minister of the Interior how he intended to provide for the civil state of Jews who might declare themisdves ua,
willing to belong to their congregations. He also; Ibegged Miniseters to present a Bill for providing Iproof of the civil state of those persons who might
Inot wish to enrol themselves under any of the religions now recognized by the State. M. Valerie then related a story of a certlian advocate in Savoy (a disciple of Roususea), who did not wish his child to be baptized, in order that he miaht be free to choose a religion when he arrivedc at mature age, and who presented himself to the cur6 of his parish for the purpose of registering'the birth of the infant.,. The cqrO, notXing 4o0btingi and thinking that he would afterward proceed ts the' ceremony of baptism, 'ini:rlb-ed thie nanes.'to tho father sid mother, ,a,nd eve,n; i ,anticipatit, o the child'itself; buit afterwad, 'when the father declar~ tht he wscointentwith thle reistraton
-obr and-tht-he-did-not-wish -the ehil&-to-bebaptIzed, the qurd exclaimed, that in that cse ,he could not inscribe -it in the'register, and tore out the' record which he had alreadt written. '

AUSTRIA AND SARDIMNA.
The followving note was addressed by Count Cavour, the Sardinir Miinister, to the Malrquis de Cantono, the SardininnfEnvoy at Vienna, wrhen Count Paar the Austrian Ambassador at Turin, notified his recall by his Governmnent:
"Tlurin, March 24.
"M honsieur le Marquis,-The day before yesterday Count Psar commTunicated to me a despateh from CoutmtBuol, which, after repeating the grievances that the Government of the Emperor bad enumerated on several occusions agdanst Sardinha concluded byr enjoining him, to demand his pas
ports, and quit. Turin with all the members of the Imperiaj Iegation.
"sAlthough In this despatch Count Brnol declared that this withdrawal wouzld not he an obstacle to your remaining at
V.nl o<n^rgh. d'A*ah.e the King has not deemed 1it advsble to continue the residence of a diplofnatic agenti at the Court of Austrisin the abecnce of an Austrian Ecwoy at Tcrin.
"YOu will consequently have thefgoodness to communti caLte this des:ision to the Minister of FRoreign fairs -of Auti, and immediately tske measuTres for retuning to Piedmont with all the Legation.
P In makng this commuinicaton to eoutnt Bfom youn will give him the assurance that Austrian subjects will cntinne to enjoy in the Sbtes of .ithe King the protection of thelaws and the rights whit h treaties accord them; and youI wFil add, that the Sardinlan Government will do every. thing i its power to lnsur that private intecrests shall suffer as little as possible by the Interrnption of diplomatic relathons between the t ao cobutrles. i
" We have noticed with pleasure az smilar declarati n contalinedt in the despatre aidreased to Count Pasr. in givlng thereto full confidence we are induced to believe that no grievance canarse to ggravate the situation omhich results from the STeP the Imperial Government has just takeet.
"Hl y had your recall been deCded npon when I gave directions by telegraph to the Mauquis de Villamarina to entreat the G;overnment of the FPrench E;mperor to have the tindness to tnoke npon itself the protection of Sardinian stbjecs in Anstria. ghaving received a reply altogether favorOlable, 90ou will be pleased to acquaixnt Coutnt Bulol with thisfact. If, as I do notdonbt,M.denouIrquency hasreceived instuoctiond in conformity with this from his Government, yon ill deliver to him the archives of the Legation, and make with him suitable arrangements for the expedition of pending afflirs. The high position which that diplomatist occupies affords me the satisfaction of thinling thatthe interests of oir fellod witipens could not be intnrsted to better hands.
"rCont Bnol, in hiadespatch recalling Count Pas., requests him to render an account immediately of any fresh explanations I might have to give him. I regret not being able to satisfy this expectation. From the moment the recall of the Imperial lgation was nnonced to a iin anofficialand definitive manner it became no longer possible for nsoto enter into ny political discussion r ith CountPaar. I have been obftged, in consequence, to limeit myself to expressing to him my regret at a meare which appeato me by no means justin able,a rereet rendered the more painful by the retirement from Turin of a diplomatist who, in the accomplishment of a mission frequenty difficlt, hadl given me proofs of a character as honourable as it was conciliatory. -
"I have too much contidence in the high impartiality of Count Buol to doubt that he will hi.t utpon the true motniveg for the observations which I have thought it right to make in attributing to hhm the intention of aggravating a differentce which we ave the consciousness of having done all that depended upon usto prevent.
"'In takng leave of Count Butol yo will read tohim this destch, and leave himn a copy of it, if such should be his desire.

Amoig these may be mentioned two airs of Handel-" Would yot gain the tender creature ?" and "Souod an alarmr"-both sung rmazkably well by 'Mr. Clovers clever pupil, Mr. Msanda; Spohs lovel song, ' The bird and the maiden," very prettilv iven b Miss Jalia Bleiden, the clarinet obliggo part he y fonned upon the oboe by Mr Alfred Nxcholson e

Mozart's " Dove souo," adapted to English words, and sung with graceful and unaffected. exprepsion by Miss Theresa Jefferys, the grand aoprano-scene from Der Freesehutz, in which Miss Stabbach produced a legitimate effect; and various other morceamu of equal attraction, by the artistes we have named, completed the vocal selection, which may justly be traised as unexceptionable. The Eecond trio of Mendelssohn performed by Mademoiselle Coulon (pianoforte, Mr. Blagrove (violin), and M.Pa ue (violoncello); the Pantasie Caprice of Vieuxtemps, amirably executed on the violin byr. Blagrove; a pianoforte sonata of Beethoven, by Mademoiselle Coulon; and the violoncello solos of hL Pa

If the " Educational Concerts for the People," which we understand are conducted on the system of commonwealth, can be made to answer-with a reasonable return to the artists as well as to the entreprenar-it will be a cause for [ atisaztion, since their design is exoellent, and, suecess.

The carpetbag was saturated -wit blood An alarn was given. and a doctor came, but by that time Aplinw p*l'eoty ;deid. The-body wssearched,but there wa no*anaoney found, although shortly before the body was found the de

as m,ade, ior the persons who had been last seen with the deceased,. Gorge 'and Thomas Apli lwere found Ina pabllchouse about ii o',cloch. They were carefully searched, but ne.ther money nor blood w ound upon them, and it ws asoertained in what way they had been employing them*elve during the internl of time betwen ther being seen with the dooeezed ani bug found in th beerhoue The police went to the houe of the prisoner's father; but he was not there. The polie Watched that house al the night, and about 7 in the mornig they saw the prisoner coming past. They immediately arrested hli, and charged him with having murdered a man the previoua nightinGrvan's.lane. The prisoner said, "You don't sy so_?" The praoner Was slightly rched, and a sovereign and_ lOd, were found -upon ,him. He was asked if he had any more money. He sad he hid' not, There 'was a knif' in hbs pocket, all over blood There ws also blood upon his trousers pocket li apon his hands. He said the blood upon hir knife wasa+, tributable to his having cut some beef with it. Msr. Hera. path, the eminent chtymist, swore that having examined ihe blood on the knife wthx a very powerful microscope, he ws enabled to state that that blood a not the blood of a bul. l'ock, bat was hnuman blood. It being desirble to have the pisoner in safe cestody as soon aspossible, he was taken to Wiveliscombe, and was thezn frther searched, and a xsm of three sovereigns was found in hisfob so that he wasin pos ression of four sovereigns, he only having received half-a.
sovereignfrom his niaster. As soonastheprisoner wasap. prehended, his shoes were tken off, and one of them was compared with the marks of iootsteps on the road leading from the spot where the pool of bloodwas found in the lane, inan opposite direction to that in which the cart wsgoing and the shoe corresponded completeyr with one of those marks in every prticular. These facts Were provedby many witnesses. Dr. Edwards stated that the cut in the throat was nine inches in length, from one ear to the other. It was a clean cut, and must have been done with t sharp instrument. There had beeh repeated cuts,-four cuts -on thoright side, first superficially and then sinling deep into the throat, making one deep cut, passing through the wrindpipe,dividing the whole of the bloodveueelsontheleft sideof the throat and the musdes that protected them,, and terminating one inch beyond the left ear and one inch below it. That was quite sufficient to eause the drath and did cause it; and the wound could not have boen inflicted by the de. ceaaed himself. There were marks on the left cheek as if done by fingernails, as if 'the cheek had been held while the throat was being cut. The neckkerchief was cat through longitudinally about five inches, taly'ing wth the cut in the throat. The mucous mombranes of the mouth aud throat and the intestines differ, as tLey aro covered with scales of a different shape. This was a new sidence discovered by the intense power of the microseope. Human blood could be distinguished from that of an annotL The blood ran out atthe bottom of the cart on to the pround. The wound must have been inflicted in the crt Thero ws blood outside the cart as well as in it.
Mr. Hlerspatli stated that on the 31st of Decomber he reeeived a knife, sn allclothes, black coat, shirt, waistoat, and one legging. There was a smear of blood inside the flap of the smillelothes and many spots on the outside. There was a blood-spot on the sleeve, two on the inside of the sleeve. On the shirt, three mark on the cuff of the riGht aleeve insdde; on the let cuffmany bloodmaks On the waistcoat, blood in the right hand pocket, a smear and two spots. Afterwards received another legging, on which was a small smear of blood. lMinuteportions of blood were taken from the knie for purposes of examination. The blade had been immersed in living blood up to the hilt. The blood had not coagulated until it was on the knife. Blood from a human body would coagulate in about 12 minutes. Could not say positively from what animal the blood had come. The giobules were theCize of these ot his own blood and of other men. Had compared them with the blood of the ox, the sheep, and the pig, and these globules were larger than those of either of the three anim The difference in size was considerable. It was a recived siom in science. They were 1-3,400th of an inch; of the ox, 1-5,300th; the sheep, 1-5,200th of the pig, 1-4,500th. Thu relative sizes would be as 53 to 34 ot the ox, 52 to 34 of the sheep, and 44 to 34 of the pig. The inference was that it wa not the blood of either of those three animals. Thez approximated nearly to the human blood. The blood of a man excited by drifik would make no difference. He used strong microepbpo pover; the proportion would le aa inch to 30 feeL Rtpeated the operinients many tim3es with the same eslts. There was on the knife certain scales such as aro found in the mucous membrane of the throat. They are a kind of empty clls. They were much lar
than the globules of the blood, and were perfectly distungoisb;able. Theywere totallg different to those of an an{. mal, From the appearances, the knife had passed through the mucou3 membrano which forms the lining of the throat. There werea^few fibre5 inthc nail notch of the knife. They

public demanded it. Justice was Goed's wok, and they Iwere hisministers to do it
The LORD CHIF-JUSTICE then summed up. He was suite sure the jury required from him no request to give tbeir most anious and undivided attention to this case.' Thoy had to stand between what ias believed on the part of the prosecution to be a demand for public justice and the man who now stood upon his trial, and he was called upon to answer with his life for the crime imputed to him. The evidence had ranged over two days, and would require that they should exercise their judgment upon it with all the power and anxious attention they
could devote to it. It was admitted, and it could not be ! disputed, thatthe unfortunate man whose death they were | now inquiring about had come to his end by a foul and cruel murder. They must start, then, with this fact,-that by some one or other the deceased man was murdered on the night of the 23d of December, and the whole question intho coase was this, and only this,-Was the prisoner at tha bar the person upon whose head rested the guilt of having taken away this man's life? He would endeavour to recall tho evidence to their minds. It was clear that the prisoner and the deceased were together during the greater part of that day, and it was proved that the deceased had five sovereigns in his pocket. The ostler said the prisoner insisted upon going in the cart with the deceased. Aplin took out his money, and Thomas Aplin said, " Put up your money again in your purse ;" he did so, and the ostler said the prisoner could heatand see that. The horse was young and spirited. Aplin was starting when the prisoner jumped up into the cart and wanted to drive, but the deceased said he would drive him. self, and they went off at a slow pae shortly before 9. They vent through the turnpike, came back again, and then returned. What it was they turned back for was not known. The prisoner spoke to the turnpike woman. They were then going on towards their home. The jury then came to the point where Grant's-lane turned off, and a man named Waterman, who was at work at the corner, said he saw a cart with two men in it turn down that lane. No other cart had gone through the tarnpike. He saw a barrel in the cart, and the deceased's cart had a barrel in it when they started from Wiveliscombe. Waterman heard the church clook strike 9 at the time he saw tho cart. The cart was now traced into the cutting in Grant's-lane, and it must have been half an hour in Grant's-lane before the dead body was discovered. Slocombe and his wife were passed by the cart. The horse was galloping. There was then, apparently, no one in the cart. They walked slowly on to their home, half a mile off, and it was then 10 minutes to 10. Then the witnesse spoke to the cart stopping and the finding the dead body of the deceased in it. The body was searched, but there was not any money nor any purse. They then had evidence of the distances between the several points. Dr. Edwards came, and be traced back the marks of a horse's hoof tiU he came to a pool of blood the size of a sheet of blotting-paper. Dr. Edwards afterwards described the state of the body. When did they next see or hear of the prisoner ? He was seen by a young girl some distance off at 10 o'clock, and she had a conversation with him, and 'they wished each other "good night." The alarm of murderhad been given, snd as It was known the prisoner had been last seen with the deceased, the constables went to his father's house, some eight miles off. He was not to be found. They watched the road, and about 7 in the morning the prisoner was observed coming, and they took him. They proceeded to search him, and they described what they Found upon him. They then came to the footmark, and that was very important. Were they satisfied that that was the track of the risoner's boot? because, If they were, it was evident that the prisoner had gone from that spot on foot. He must have gone there in the cart and returned on foot. If, thereoze, they traced him to the spot, what was the inference? The evidence weighed with fearful force against the prisoner, and the learned counsel had endeavoured to meet it. It was for them to say whether they thought the evidence identified the track with the boot. The nails were put in irregularly. Would that have happened to another boot, although made by the same maker? Would he put the diamond here and the square here as they were put in this boot? If it was the prisoner's track it was found the next morning in the bne vrhero this foal deed had been com. -mitted. They then had the evidence of Mr. Herapath as
to the blood. It had been proved that on that day the prioner had three teeth drawn. It would be dxngerous, therefore, to attach any great importance to the faf ef some few minute spots of blood being found on his clothes. But then came the knife. The question was, was there blood found on the knife? Was it human blood? They would take the knife and look at it. Mr. Eerapath had explained to them his view of it. He said it could not be the blood of an animal, as described by the prisoner. It excited rise when they heard that he had eaten the meat saw. Stllthat might be so. But Mr Herapah took upon himself to say it was not the blood of a dead animal. It was living blood, and it was human blood, and he had shown them the marvellous powers of the modern microscope. At the same time, admitting the great advantages of science, they were comng to great niceties Ideed when they specua9ted upon things almost be. yond perception, and he would advise them not to convict on this scientific sgpculation alone. Was the explana. tion of the prisoner sat sfactory 7If it was not, then the knife was round upon him next rmorning coverod with blood. Then came the fact about the money. He at first denied having more than one sovereign and 10d. in copper, Ultimately he gave up three more sovereigns, but no silver Tho decesed had five sovereigns; and on the prisoner were foundfour. Whathadbecomeoftheothersovereign? Itmight have dropt in the scuffle. It was of the utmost importance if they :were not satisfied with the cxplanation given by the prisoner. The father says he let him have the money, and had given an account of the money he had, which hlid been confirmed by the actuary from the savings-bank. One could understand how a poor oldman, seeing the prisoncr in suoh poril, might give way to tem tation and perjure him. self to save his own son's life. The three constables said the old man had said his son had only a few shilings, but then they all differed as to the questions which had been put to the father. One said it was, "Has he muchmoney about him I" Another said it was, "If he knew what money his son had with him when he went out in the morning?" The third said it was "Some one is taken u,; if we could see your son we couldput it all right." Therefore, they all differed. The father must baeo known that four sovereigns were found on his son. If the old man's story was false, would he not have said he gave him four sovereigns, and not three soveredgns and half. asovereign? Would not that go some way to satisfr them that the old man's ftorT was trae? He had thought it right to make t'hese observations, and they must deal with them. Mis Lordship then took a rapid review of the whole case. It they were satisfied that the prisoner was the Jut man seen with the deceased, that the track was his, and that the blood on the knife had riot been accounted for, what werethey to say? If the mystery was too great for themto deal with and created a reasonable doubt, then the prisoner was ontitled to the benefit of that doubt. The man was murdered; for his murder law and justice demanded that vengeance should be executed, but they must take carethat l doing justice to the dead they did not do injustice to the living.
The learned Judge was three hours and a-half in sumsuing up.
The jury retired at 8 o'clock, and, on their return into court at 20 minutes past 8, gave. a verdict of Ouily.
The LOB,D Cumn JUSTICE then addressed the prisoner in these terms :-Thomas Nation, you have been found guilty, after a patient aud careful inqury, of the great crnme of wilful murder. For that crime the law awards the punishment of death, and assuredly there is nothing in your case Ito stand between you andthe fulfilment of the law. This ws no orime done upon sudden provocation, or in the heat of blood, or under the influence of those passions which sometimes lead men to commit acts against God and man's law. You committed this croime for the mere motive, the sordid motive, of plunder. You know that your viotim had the few pieces of gold in his possession, and, though ha was your companion and your friend, you took advantage of the opportunity anozded by the darkness of the nmht, and you sprung upon hiim in the loneliness of his helplessuess, and you took his lfe. For this the law exacts the penalty of your life. I do not dwell upon these things, believe me, with the view of aggravatinlg th misery of this sad hour, but with a view of awakening you to a sense of the enormityr of your guilt and the hopelessess of your state to make yoU sensiblo that all hope of mercy in this world is at an end, so that you may turn your thoughts to that quarter whenco only succour can come, and prepare yourself or your dreadful doom. You will have the oppor. tuanity in the brief interval afforded you-alas ! there Was none afforded to our unhappy victim-of preparing yourself to meet your eoori. You will hnave religious inatruc. tion and consolation. Avail yourself of those things right spedly, for your days-nay, your very homs, are num-
bee, and I hope that your punishment, and still mOre ;our eoniteuce, may afford an atonement for the guilt you havJe brought upon ,voursalf.
iuls Ieof shu then Paa3ed upon the prisoner the awful centence of the law.
The tral bas lasted two long days.

Mr. Whateloy, Q.C., and Mr. Phtipson appeared for the' plaintiffs; and Mr. Keating, Q.C., anid lMfr. Alacnamara for the defendants.
The plaintiffs In this action, W. and E. Clifford, ivere builders, and the defendants, Messrs. Frost and Bate, were contractors, who had taken a contraot for the' con'tictiohn of the Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Dudley Railway'.
The action was brought by the plaintiffs against the de-' fendants to recover damages for the breach of a tubcontriact into which the defendants bad enteredwith the plaintiffs in May, 1847, 'whereby the plaintiffs were IIto builcAhe bridges and culverts from Westbromwich to Wednes-5 bury Brooke as are required by the engineer of thii '

It appeared that anrAe6 differences had arisen between, the parties in the'cora of the work, wbich ended in an agreemeut being etnd into between them in March, 1850, whereby the 'deofendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs .101. for cErtworks done, including a sum of 281. 3s. 10d. in rese. of bridges, and the plaintiffs were to proceed,vith the workaccording tothecontract-. In June,'1850, theliW' tiffs had brougat an action for the 1001.) *hich' the defen_ants paid, except the 281. 3. 10d. ; and when an action o8 debt was, in February, 1851, brought for that amotnt the action was, in April, 1851, reterred to U Mr. Fowler, w4o was to scertain what was due to the plaiutiffs in respe4o
the agreement. The arbitrator awarded 'the plaintifi the. amount claimed. The plaintiffs then applied to the, defendants to be allowed to bi;ild other bridge; accordintg o' the
original contract, but the defendants said, the ai l should not build any more, and told them they might go to law. The present action was then brought to recover.da. mages for this breach of contract, and the plaintifib 1ought to recover as damages the profit of 1s. od, a cubic yard which the,r would have made, on allthe bridges subequently built on the line.
At the close of the plaintiffs' case,
Mr. KETIrEG submitted that the plaintiffi were bound to. show that the bridges were required by the compaii's engineers
sJustice Cme owD. said he thought that might b)e assumed.
Mr. KEAvTING then contended that the plaintiff;s wereon.n I
ready and willing to fulfil their contract, inasmuch as Wty were not willing to provide stone or tiaber.
Mr. Justice CRowDE, Eaid the contract did not couteinplate either. ,II
It waa ultimately agreed that the amount of dainsei

The trial occupied the whole day till past 9 o'clock at night, and excited considerable interest. His Grabe the Duke of Norfolk, lord Petre,'and other gentlemnen were on the bench with the Cardina.
Mr. Serjeant PIGOTT, in opening the cas, stated that the action was brought to recover a document which containtd an acknowledgment of a debt due to tho plaintiff, and which had been intrusted to the defendant under these circuma. stances :-The plaintiff, the Abbe Roux, was apriCA of the Roman Catholio church. In the year 1845 he became aoqusinted with Madame Wyse, the wife of the English Minister at Athens, and frat cousin of the Emperor- othe French, and who was now entitled to be called Wy Wyse . and the document in question was given by hertothe Abbe. in the year 1847 as an acknowledgment of a debt of 25,000f. which she then owed him. It appeared that Madame Wyse had been separated from her husband, and when the Abb6 became acquainted with her she was living In a tate of great poverty, her allowance from her husband being ornly 2001; a-year. The Abbe had receied kindness 'from';Car. dinal Fesch, Madame Wyse's uncle, and was thus inducled to aympathizervith her misfortunes, and to lend her money aroiUli3ng Wihe'sum of 25,000,f In the year 1847) however, he founil that Madame Wyee had fallen back into; her former habits of extravagance, and ho made up his mind to render her no further asistance. He then closed ls'account with her, and took the acknowIedgment in.question,. and came to London to endeavour to get payment from Mr. Wyse, her husband. At the same time he had-in his hand bills for 8,000f. which MAdame Wyse had obtained from her son. When he came overto England he gave the bills in question to Cardinal Wisemar, who was a friend of Mr. WysE, in order that the Cardinal might give them ip to Mfr. Wyse, and at the samie time he gave the Cardinal the acknowledgment in question, in order that he might see 'if he could not get Mr. Wyse to acknowledge his liability-and pay the amount. Mr. Wyse received the bills, but 'said lie wouldbavenothingto do with payinghiswife'sdebts. T4e document, however, remained in the Cardinal's hands illl the year 1854, when Madame Wysv's cousin, Louis NTapoteon; had become Emperor of the French. It wasthen found that the Emperor recognized the debts of the different members of' his faily, and the Abbe was naturally anxious to obtain possession of the document which he bad left with the Car.' dinal. He accordingly applied to him for itin April, 184, when the Cardinal was in Faris. Tbe Cardinal then said he would search for it among his papers when he returned to England, and retsore it. The document, however, was riot forthcoming. The Abbe then came to England,;but the document could not bo found. He then applied to Mr. Helder, Mr. Wyse's attorney, and was informed that'tAe document had been handed back to the CaSdinal. The Cardinal then said it had been handedTto Mr. Wya, but iKhbn asked to write to Mr. Wyse to get it returned, he'sefusd to do so. The Cardinrl, however, promised to' writel a letter to the Emperor, Stating that he had seen the document; but ie left London the day afle
without writing the letter he had promised. he'Cardinal on his return to London agin promised to write a letter to the Emperor, and asked the Abbe to make a draught, as he said he was not accustomed to write lettees to Emperors. The Abbe prepared the draught, and left it with the Cardinal, but when he called for the letter he wanz again told that he had gone out of town. The Abbe then tried to get the document from!l(r. Wyse; but, findipg he could not get it either from Mr. Wyse or-from the Cardinal, he at length brought the present action. His onli object was to recover the document, which the defendant had no right to detain- but if the defendant would not,give' it up the pla1ntiff would be entitled to the amotmt (25,0O0f.), for which it was given as a security.

that I might give it to the Prince. 'I wrote such l etter the same day, and took it to hid Eminence. He said he would copy the letter the' same evening, andImight'call for it the next day.

N- icho&s CxrdinaWi sem_a, exam1od by Mr. PHIPsosr. aid,-In 1847 I had been lmany years aqnuinted with 3r Wyse. Mr. And .7n WYselved apart. In 1847-tli
Plaintiff called upon me. It was the first time I had seen him. Hecame to me as a F,rench prest hohad omeo
a budnem of. charity. ie stated he caife to effee kf possible, a reconcilidion tweena,r.A-d M. Wyse
he had known Ms.Wlixlbr-some yeas; that her conduFt was then exceedingly good and virtuous; and that it was his dedsre to make pecee between her and her husban. He asked me to be the conciliator, and, as a bishop, t conEidered it was mY duty not to reuse when one of my flosk was concerned. I believe he asked me to secure hinmAn 2nterview with Mr. Wyse. The Abbe at the first, or at:'
subsequentinterview,-showed metwo ses of doeuient's Some -were b;is of exchange, signed by 3r. Wyaes o4. He also showed me an ackcnowledgment of Madame Wy*e for 2,.000f. Hoe sad he wished to ask lr. WY" to pay it. All my duty was a ptt him In communication with Mr.W_se. HE did notashkmeto be the intermedisybetwoen him and'31r. Wyse. I would'not have undertaken such an offace. Ididnotreply, "Mosttwillingly." Ineverundertook' to obWn n part of i from Mr. Wywe I simplyrecollect having seen the docunment, and having had it in my handi& The next time I saw the Abbe wasin PAris, I recollect in general that the document contained some ort of acimow. ledgment of a debt, and " 'sacred debt." I now recollect,on t adng about it, that it wan for 25,000f. After the. Abb Ron left I never again spoke to lMr. Wyas on, the subject. I never proposed to tin. Wyse to paj"it. I spoke to him on the subject of the reconciliation in 1847, In' the lut interview with theAbbe I told him he had bettex, take his papers back. He sid, " As Mr. Wye has refused; to y the debt, there it no other person on earth by uliomn. I can expt to be paid." I am pretty sare I ss* the-AM6 in Paris irn April, 1254 I cannot feel smre whether the Con. versation I bad with the Abb6 was in -Paris or in London. If I sid I would " send the documenta beck," I must have Ead, "' If the' document has been left with me, I will find it and send it back." On my erturn to London I searehed and could not find it. I afterwards saw the Abbe in' Iondon in Way. I wrote a letter also to him on the' 5th of June, 185C After that letter I saw -the Abbe frequently. The Abbe used to come o .me and, ask for his title. I referred him to Mr. HEaring, my solicitor, with in$tructions to tIae It. When I Was in Paris the Archbishop spoke to me about a certain Abb6Roux. The Abb6 came over to Englnd, and I appointe
him to a temporary employment. The AbbeWapplied to nie to write a letter to Prince Lucien. I believe I gave him an introduction to the Prince. He also applied to me to gi'e him a letter to the Emperor. Ie sent me a copy f the document, which hea id he wrote-ot frommemory, aad aked me to certify that I haW seen such adocamet.
believe I signed such a certHilete. The Abbe came to me ad aid he had been to Pari,-and asked for that debt of 25,O00f fronithe Government,andtheyhAdsadtohicP.oduos your title." - He thea sad, "If you WMl' writh a'
-deolaition that you ehave Senthis docitOenk yobr wotd. will be equlvlent." He then wrote out the docnment, and,. considering it to be the substance, I ined the certificate. I esimnot give the exact date, but u believe it Was In the Autumn of 1854. The Abb also asked me to write' to the Eimperor to the tame effect. That was suliaeauent - to - the eertfifcate. I suppos because; ,the fist war nit sufficient; fCI epromisi to snd such a letter, bett I afterwvards declined, for malid reasons. r gave the Abb6asbWde1tefor a tm.

at Cla*mw.
The Court sat to-day to hear appea s agans the refusAls vf divisional justices to renew or grant licenses to sell 'exciseable liquors under tie 9th of George IV., cap. 61. lihere were seven on the list.
Walliam Lambert appeaed agant the refal of the faylebone justices to renew a lioenae to the Prince of Wales, Gret Barlow-street. The appel was allowed with-out opposition, and the lioense granted.
John Gurney appled against the refusal of the Padding'ton jugtces to grant a liccsse to a house and promises Eiltate at No. 1, Desborough-place, Harrow-road. This apreal had been entered too soon, and was straok out.
William Tailby appealed against the refusal of the Kenington 3ustices to grant a license to some premises situate 4st (umberland.placo, North-end-road, Fulibam.
Mr. BoDKIrappead for the appellant, and ctrongly rged upon the Bsench the necessity which existed for tho yremises in question to have a license. I4hoe court below eight tustloes wvrer present,-one of them declined to give is vote, four did vote for the license, and only threo against iti; blt; the chairman held that thie license was not; granted, because it required the votos of a majority of the ma
trates present, and that therefore the voes of the four were met a majority.
Mr. CoorEopposed on behalf of the respondent justices znd also forthoandlords of two publichouses adjacent to the appelant's prm th Bell and Anchor and the lngs Thosetwohouses afforded, he said, all the accommodftion required in the neighbourhood.
The deoision of the jutices was reversed, and the license Lated.
William Beat appeled against the refusal of the Marylebone Iustices to renew a hlceise to tho Jacob's Well, 13. 0harles-street, Manchester-square.
Mr. BoDTS:IN mid he oould not contend against the facts upon wbich the magistrates refused to renew this license, but he had an arrangement to suggest, which he hoped tho opposing magstrates would be satisfied with. In consequence of infornrztlon given to the police boys were found in the appellant's house playing at cards for beer, and the mnagistrates properly interfered and stopped his license. 'The appeilant would undertake to quit the house, and the license would be immediately transferred to an urs-oep.- tionable tenant, if the magistrates thought fit to renew it upon those conditions.
Mr. P. N. LAUnax, one of the respondent justices, said they could not oonsent to that pronosition. It was absolately necessary that a pubho exanmple should be made in such a cas
Mr. METCALFE, on the part of the respondents then sAted -that in October last complaints were made o the police of a number of boys, from 12 to 16 years of age, being allowed to pla at cards and bagateUe for money and beer at the Jaco s WelL It had become such a ieElar thing that the police acted upon the complaint of some of the boys' mothers, that their earnings, as errand lads, and such like were squandered there, instead of being taken home. Two -detectives were employed, and no less than 25 boys were Sound there at one time, using language of the most horrible 4esoription.
Threo police officers-378 A, 299 D, and 99 D-were cxamined upon thatEtatement
Mr. BODKIN addressed the Bench for the appellant, but The appeal was dismissed with costs.
William Carruthers appealed against the refesa of, th YisuyJustices to renew a license to the Thrco Jolly Weavers, John's-row, St. Luke's.
Mr. Bodkin appeared for the appellant; there was no counsel to oppose.
The AssISTANTrJUDGE saidl the refusal which wasap pealed alainst in this case took place on the 21st of Marh and the present session began on the 1st of ApriL Tho Act of Parliament required that 12 days at Ileat should elapse between the refusal and the sessions to which the appeal
xnust be carried, and if the next sessions after the refusal began within 12 days, then the appeal lay to the next subsequent session. In this case 12 days at leasthadnot elapsed between the refusal and the sessions, so the appeal zhould have been enteredfor May. The Court, hetthought, therefore had now no jurIsdistIon to try it, nor power to postpone it, the recognizances being for a 'wrong session.
i Mr. BODKit said this was a most important point, said involved the ruin of many houses to his own knowledge. 'The act specified 12 days, of which five were allowed to the person who felt himself aggrieved to consider whether he would appeal or not, and seven were for notice to be given -to the justices. If on the first day of the five the person resolved to appeal, and gave notice at once to the justices, -lie complied with the term of notice required for the justices; and therefore, even if the sessions began under 12 days, or 10 days, he submitted th3t the appeal was good and could be heard at thoseo sessions.
The AssISTANTr-JuTDG said he had no doubt whatever
in his own mind hbout the point.
Mr. BOD KLIj asked what position the appellant and others zituated like him wouldl be in for at least a year if this 'Were so .
The AssIsTuAXTJuDaG observed that they must acquiesce In wvhat the inagistrates below had done if the appeals could not he heard.
Mr. L,tuRIE Said, as it was a question for the majority of the Bench to decide, he should move that they retire to consider it.
After a short discussion the magistrates retired, and ulti. pately, on the question being put in court whether the apo ipa jol eheard, 9 were for and 8 against. The Assistant-Judge then voted with the 8. and, the numbers being equal, nothing could be done in the matter.
mr. WOODWVAIRD, as one of the respondents, said the justices did not oppose the appeaL
The AsisTXN'T-JUDQE said he had been examining the motice of appeal, and lie thought It might do for the May session, although theorecognizances were for Ap ril
Mr. WOODW,=sD considered the notice would do for the mext session if properly foUowed up.
The matter then dropped, no order being made.
WilliamaHollingsworth appealed against the raefusal of the Uaxylebone justices to renew a license to the Elephant and Castle, in Oxford-market.
Mr. Cooper appeared for the appellant; Mr. Bodkin opposed, on the ground that Mr. Hollingsworth had been improperly traffickinig with the license.
Appeal allowed; license granted.

BOW-SThEET.-Two apprentices, namd William Ray and Walter Walters, inte eemloy oM 3essrm Jonas, wholesale cigar manfacures, Of Hi%h-olborn, were chared with stealing cigars, and Wihm y, the older, the father of theflistprisoner, was haed with having feloniously re. ceived and disposdof tem
The evidence went toshe#r that the apptentices had been in the habit of stowing aay immense quantities >of cigars in the siades of their boots, thus escaping the' .ch u1ay made at ewh-eublishments when the workpoople lett pemiss. SBeeides what waa'taken from the prisoners, seversibindles were found:at i, rorishop in Dean. street, Soho, where*th father carriedon the'businsa of a 'carenter; and itltrrther appeared that the elder Ray had
hold nge*#antities to atobacconist-nainea WVilliams, ia athbone-lace, representing that he 'had taken themmto oblige a fiend 'forw hom he had been lately wrking..
'Such of'the stolen property ashd been found clearly identified by ;r. M. Newton, the prosecuthoesrforeman, who re&uested a remand.
A'sohcltor iwh attendedI for the *elaer Hayi ueggeadthat 'hiscijeirtinigh be admitted to bail On iccOnet;of- his Xc'spectnbi=ty,t
Mr. HBn u refused the application, declaring thathe had ,never met with a much worse ease, the father having en-
couraged'his eon to rob his employer, and assisted in. dispos. in 'oathe sbolen property afterwards.
The priseners were rearidedforfuther examination.
A 'tiekt-of-leave man named Thomas Deeri oig and another-nan named Richmond; were committed for tisl in two casea of burglary-one of them beilg at an empty house where a policeman's uniform was the 'only property takes, the officer having had the charge of the place.
WonsEp-sTRmaxT.-Thomas Wood was pharged with being concerned in an assault and robbery.
Ar. Louis Wolfe, a frit merchant, s wd,-I was walking arm-in*arm with a friend of mine,'a, foreigner residing at t'he ~West-end, last night, when, in passing through Comn. mercial-street, Whitechapel, a woman wlho was 'talldag to the prisoner stepped forward and said something to me I could not underntand, as I am rather deaf. I held down my 'headandasked lier. "What dia you sayl" rand was listening for'her answer, when she flung herArm round me, and the next instant I was seized by the hair and dragged down backwards. My friend interfered for, my protection, but we were almost immediately surrounded by a large erowd of persons, who illused us much, and it was with some difficulty the prisoner was apprehendedt. (This witneis had one of 'his eyes severely centused, andhis face also exhibited other indications of shameful usage.)
The last witness's friend said,-1 wa in company with Mr. Wolfe, and saw him treated in the manner e has described. I interposed for his assisce, and graspd hold of tho prisoner, whom I succeeded, notwithstanding the mob, in holding until a policeman could come up and take hlm I then found that my watch, which was safe in my pocket just before, had been broken away fron the guard round my neck and stolen, and nothing has been seen of it since
P'risoner.- I know n~othing at all about this robbery but I saw the gentleman hitting away, right and left, angmisbehaving himself towards the woman, and I of course interfered on her behalf.
Mr. D'EYrcoUvT.-Nhere do you live ?
Prisoner.-In Kent-street, in the Borough.
Mr. D'EYycoUnT.- I shall remand you for the present, and [if It is ascertained that you have been convicted before I shall send you for trial.
Sbe foreigner entreated that the m~atter might be dealt with at once, or he could not attend, he havng8 tostr almost immediately for Hiollard;* bult it was found he could stay in England for a day or ttto,and, as the polled engaged to get the evidenice completed by thea, the prisoner'was re manded that some trace mighit be obtained of the woman.
CrznnvENwxL-Charles Creasy and James Foreman wero finally examined, charged 'by Mr. Wslliim Treggon, of the fnim of Treggoh and' Co., galvanized vron manufacturers, of 66, St. John-street; Clerkenwell, &c., with having been concerned In a forgery. And' 'obtaining money under false and fraudulent pretences
Mr. Wontner conductod the prosecuti6n, and in opening the case said it was one of cousiderable importance in a commercial point of view. His clients were in extensive 'buinessand had several estblishments; oneofwhich wasin Jewin-street,whero they had a-counting-house. The prisoner Creasy had been a long timeain their' service as warehouseman, and it wan his dutr 'to weigh 'good. in and out at the factory, when zinc and cuttings were purchased. After Creasy had' weighed the. property he had to enter the amount of weight in a bookan give a note to the vendor, and keep a counterfodil setting out the weight, which, being presented to the cashier in Jewin-street, would entitle the holder to receive' the.sum set out in the note. The prisoner Foreman presented a note for I owt. of cuttings; and it was in Creasys'.andwriting. It was at length disco,tred 'that Cremy, in conjunction with Foreman, had been cing on asystem of fraud to a considerable extent,, Creasy weighing cuttings and giving a note setting forth the amount as considerably more than the weight,: arid foi a snm -they were not entitled to claim. Suspicion being created, .a person, a
nlumer namoed Smith, gavd infoltmation-to thi firm of. Treggon and Co. of the delinquenbies of the prisoners, who wore given into custody. Wr. Wontner added, that however extensive the business of persons might be if servants like Creasy were 'not checlied in scl'precksoTi
and examples made of them it would strike 'at the root of respectable firms. He calledI
Mr. W. Gale, the manager of the business of the firm of Treggon and Co., who confirmed these facts, and as having vad money to Foreman oi presenting the note in
TreT anadwritiiig.
The man Smith was sworn, and said ForemAn a'plied to him telling him if he could get any zinc cuttings he could get im agood price for them at Tlreggon and:Co.'%, He proved havin had dealing8with Creasy and Foreman, and giving the J ormation, as stated by 3£r. Woatter in his opening address.
Mr. Charnock, for Creasy, cross-examined this witness.- He gave the information disinterestedly. Was tried for felony and punished 12 or 13 years ago.
Evans, 145 G division, gave evidence to prove that he was employed to watch the prisoners, and saw Foreman take sine to the establishment in St. Johlistreet, Clerkenwell, and found in Creasy's possession some counterfoils of credit notes, which had boeen taken from' Creasy's book, which were identified through their numbers, one, No. 64, for two' garters of cuttings in favour of Foreman.
After further evidence,
lir. TyRviwrr asked if the prisoners 'wished to say anything in their defence ?
Mr. Charnock said he would reserve their defence, and the prisoners were fully committed for tral for forgery. &,
THnA=s.-Carl Schwartz, a heavy-looking German about 40 years of age, and desoribed as' ioariner, was brought before Mr. Smxus, on remuand, charged-with stealing 26 linen sheets, 12 pairs of stoclings, 12 pairs of drawers, 12 jackets, 35 chemises, 27 petticoats, 3 gowns, 7 shawls, a gold snuffbox, 2 pairs of earrings, a purse, a silver needlecase, and a variety of other articles, the property of a Datch woman named Katrine Steinbach.
Mr. SELFrE observed that the prisoner had committed a most disgraceful and oruel act in robbing.a poor woman of her property, of which he had obtained possession under false pretences. It also appeared that thd prisoner m&rried his seoond wife for the purpose of plunderiug her and hor daughters. He convicted the prisoner of larces; and pentenced him to be imprisoned and kept to hard labourt, for four calendar months.
LAI3rBnwm.-.Toseph Norris, a strange-looking fellow, blind of the right eye, was placed at the bar before the Hon. G. C. NOTONT, charged with smashing the plateglass window of Mr. Samuel' Burton, a watchmaker and jeweller, and stealing from the inside of tho shop seven gold and silver watch chams of thovalue of 141.
From the evidence it appdared'that on the evening before the prioner was seen to be loitering for some time in front of the prosecutor's shop, and about 4 o'clock he deliberately smashed in a thick square of plate-glass, and snatehed from the inside seven guard gold and silver chains, and bolted off with them. He was closely pursued by a young man who had witnessed the act, and was ultimately taken vithlthe property on him, when ho at onee exclaimued "rI'm done
The prisonor, who refused his address, wee spoken to by Coo the gaoler, and other officers in attendance as an old customer, and Was remanded 'to a fiiture-day.
George Haines, the son of the beadle of Upper Norwood, was finally exaniined on a charge 'of breakng ito thedwelling-houke of Hiohard Bailey 'on the night 9f the 7th of December last, and stealing therefrom 40?. in cash and a valuable gold watch.
The particulars of this caso have been beforo the public, aud it will be recollected that the prisoner had formed an impropez intimacy with the prosecutor's wife, and ii consequence of finding the guilty pair together on the 12th of last aonuth the prosecutor and pirisoner had a regular fight at theLon6n4ride eatin; n*bot"gt 'loc'ked uk.'

SOLAR SPOTS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The observers of these phenomrena should be on the alert, as the spotless and monotonous state of the solar disc which prevailed during the whole of last year, in precise conformity with the law of their periodical disappearance at regular intervals of one-ninth of a century, is evidently. giving placo to a more active state of things. Already, on the 31st of last Deoember, the appearance of an exceedingly minute speck announced a change commencing, and on the 2d of January and 9th of Febrary minute double spots were also seen, but the whole of March passed without any further indication of movement. Now, however, a group of four-twopretty-conspicuous andtwoveryminuteones -have entered on the northern hemisphere, and the state of the borders of the diso in their neighbotrhood is such as to indicate the probLbloi appearanoe of more or enlarge. ment of those existing. They may be seen with a very moderate telescopic power. The greatest interest has begu to attch itself to these appearances, which are undonbtedly connected with most important processes in the economy ofnature, and they should be observed assiduously.

CAFFRARIAN WOOL.-The mails just received
CAUItN WOOL.-The mnails just received from the Cape of Good Hope mention a fact which we regard with great satisfaction. An English settler at King william'a o had received two bales of wool growm by the Tamboolde,, and shorn from sheep of their own breeding. This was the first arival in tho co1on; of wool grown by the natives, and the occurrence was justly regarded as one of no little importance. The getting np of the-article was.-of course imperfect, but no. doubt. was entertained that an improvement in that respect would ake place, the profit on two bales being quitesuicient.tostimulatethe growers to whatever exertions might berequisiteforthe continuance and extension of the trade. When we remem. ber for how man; years the Caffre tribes have been .pervaded by chrome discontent, breaidng out at. times into serious and protracted hostilities; and when we take into coDsideration the fact that hitherto -thedr connexion with Europeans has been one. of the most deadvantagpoos character to. themselres, -fornish
many motives to war, and affording little inducetent to the. cultivation of the arts of. peaceful industr, we cannot but regard this commencement of: commerci 'relations as one of the mcet proming'evexts in the history of South Africa. And, while the tendesxey of this development of native enterprise to the elevation of the Cafio tribes and to the security and peace of the colony is so .obviou, the- ultimate advantage to our manufactures at .home,.in an increased supply of a great staple, will not .b4 asmL . The realizAtion of these prospects, hovever, depends of course upon the natives, having, their pasture grounds secured to them * and itwlnow bso re than ever politic, a sit has always iLeen ust, th at th o G3uooverrnme n t sh oul d p ut an effectL-1 stop to the constant aggressions of unscrupulous ptlers, who have on so m ny oocasions driven ouV the aborgines from their possessions, dePrived them of the *means of subsistence, and avenged with fireand sword the. resistance to their usurpations.
