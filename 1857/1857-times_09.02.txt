THE MUTINIES IN INDIA. We continue to publish from the numerous letters forwarded to us by the friends and relatives of efficers in India such as contain any new details or matter of particular interest. THE MASSACRE AT CAWNPORE. Our correspondent at Calcutta sends us the following account of the Cawnpore massacre : "The first accounts of the mutiny at Meerut and of the reception of the rebels at Delhi reached Cawnpore ;bout the 16th of May. The garrison of that station, tbe Earopean regiment having been transf erred to Lucki ow, consisted of threce native infantry regiments, tho 1st, 53d, and 5Sth, one native cavalry corps (the 2d), and abcut50 European Artiller3men. Thestation is built on a de-d level, possesses no fort or place of refuge, and is in ov.ry respeot il-adapted for defence. 'When, thorefore, the news of the Meerut revolt reached Cawnpore, and it became evident that that example would shortly be followed by the native garrison there, Sir Hugh Wbeeler at once turned his attention towards the provision of a fortified position, in a hich, at all events, he might await the arrival of succours. Pe pitched upon the hospital barrack, in the centre of the grand parade, for the purpose. He intrenched it, armed it with aU the gxns of the battery, placed in it the women I us ,nging to the depdt of Her AMajesty's 32d Foot, the ladies of the station and others, and himself remained prepared to act on the fi-st sound of alarm as circumstances might dictate, From the 15th of May to the 5th of June the feelings of the Sepoys were manifested in an unmistakoable manner. The men of the 2d Light Cavalry sent their families to their homez. Pundsayets, or native meeting5 in the lunes, wrere of nightly occurrence, and some of the men of the Ist Native Infantry shovred by thelr insolent gestures that the example of Meerut and Delhi had not been lost upon them. Had the measure been possible, Sir Hugh Wheeler would have disarmed them at onco, but with 50 Europeans to back him he was well aware that such a pro'eeding would only precipitate a revolt. He therefore carefully bided his time. In order, however, to bo quite ready for any emergency, he begged Sir Henry Lawrence who had about 600 Europeans to control. the whole province of Oude, to send him one company of Her MIajesty's 32d to remain at Cawnpore until reinforcements, then on their way, should reach him. Sir Henry sont him 70 men-all that he was able to spare, as he himself was in a very critical position. "M Matters went on in the same unsatisfactory way-con stant alarms and yet no actual crisis, until the end of May' when about 80 Europeans, belonging partly to the 84th Foot, piitly to the Madras Fusileors, reached Cawnpore. The 70 men of the 32d were then returned to Lucknow. " On the 31at letters were written to Calcutta to state that an outbreak was imminent, that Sir Hngh Wheeler had no means at his disposal to put it down, that there were from 400 to 500 women and non-combatants at the station, and to defend these not more than 150 fighting men. The utmost he could do would be to defend them all in the intrenched hospital, which he had victualled for three weeks, until reinforcements could arrive from Cal<utta. The Ist, 2d, 3d, and 4th of June passed away; not one day without alarm; and yet there was no outbreak. On the morning of the 5th an officer, the only one who, from the first, had pooh-pooh'd the idea of an insur: ection, wrote to a friend in Calcutta, ridiculing the pre. o utions that had been made. In the afternoon of the same eay he wrote to the same friend enclosing his will, end stating that the crisis had arrived or would be opeon them that evening. He, poor fellow, was one of its first victims. The particulars of the insurrection have not yet been told. We ^nly know that many officess were killed on their way to the intrenched camp, that one of the first acts of the mutineers was to seize the treasure, about 160,000N.; to open the gaols, and let loose the prisoners. They then gutted and set fire to the houses, murdered every Christian they came across, and finally proceeded to attack the entrenched barracks. "H lere, however, General Wheeler had an advantage. Tha rebels had no guns. He had several, though of small (alibre, and with their assistance he would have been able to keep any amount of insurgents armed only with old Brown Bess at bay tiU the end of time. " It is at this point of the narrative that Dhoondoopo-t Nenajee, qurasi Rajah of Bithoor, appears upon the scene. ' Isis fiend in human shape was the adopted son of the late Peishwa. On the demise of that functionary he applied to the Government of India, and subsequently to the Court of Directors, for the continuation to him of the onormous pension assigned to the deceased. By both parties he was refused, but Lord Dalhousie allowed him to keep six gone at his castellated palace at Bithoor. Theso guns turned the scale against our unhappy countrymen at Cawnpore. " This man, generaUy styled the Nena Sahib, was well known to the residents of Cawnpore, and in prosperous times was always glad, or appeared glad, to receive them at his castle, and to accompany them on their shooting excursions. He is a middle-aged man, dark-complexioned, and but for a dishonest expression would have been considered a good-looking man. The writer has seen hlim and shot in his company. The moment, however, that he I card of the mutiny at Meerut, and had felt the pulse of the troops at Cawnporo, his mind was made up. We had refused him his 'rights ;' he determined to gain them himself or perish in the attempt. HIis first hostile aot vwas committed on the persons of fugitive ladies and children from Futteyghur and elsewhere, about a hundred in number. Bithoor is only six miles above Cawnpore, and as they were passing the former place cn route to the latter he stopped their boats, brought them on shore, and remorselessly shot everyone. He then tied their bodies together and threw them into the river. This was Dhoondoopunt Nenajee's declaration of war against the British Government. This (courred early in June. The revolt broke out at Cawnpore on the 5th. No sooner had intimation of it reached the Nena than he took his guns and joined the rebels, assuming t' e command in person. Guns were procured also from Other quarters of large calibre, and with these he commenced pounding Wheeler's intrencbment, to which, with his small calibre guns, he could not adequately reply. Notwithstanding this, and that in the first fortnight he lost a' oat one-third of his force, Wheeler's heart never falled hlm. SaUy after sally did ho make, and always drove the enemy before him. Had not there been so great a crowd of ladies under his charge he could with ease have cut his way to Allahabad. At lengtb, on tbe 2Gth of June, they had but two days' supply of food left; they had no water; their ammunition was at its lowest ebb. From being confined, 'S00 in number, ina barrack originally designed to contain about 200, and from the bodies lying unburied all around them, disease in a bad form had come among them, and was decimating their ranks. But the heart of the gallant Wheeler rose with the crisis. On the 26th he was determined to make one last effort-one grand assault on the enemy's posi. tion, and to take from them the necessary supplies. He o.me out with his half-starved hand, charged the enemy, and drove them from their position; but he bad no cavalry. The enemy had been joined by a second regiment from Onde, and the two coming upon his flanks jast as he drove the isfantry before him-coming with a proportion of 12 to 1, compelled him to fight his way back. He himself was mortally wounded, and lost many men in this action. Its result and the death of Wheeler the next day damped tha hopes of the garrison. They had neither food water, nor ammunition; to remain there was to die. In this emergency they sent Mr. Stacy, the deputy-col. leotor, on the 27th of June, to treat with Nena Sahib. He was received by that victorious leader with great civilitv The followving most favourable conditions were agree3 upon :-The garrison (including women, children, and ca np followers) were to be permitted to take their arms, property. and a lac and a half of rupees with: them into country boats provided for their reception, in which they were to proceed to Allahahad. The ingenuity of hoU never before devised a blacker scheme of treachery than that daliberately planned by the Nena and shared in by all tle rebels at Cawnpore, those rebels being Sepoys who for years had eaten our salt. Our poor, miserable, half-starved countrymen were onducted faithfully enough to the boats -officers, men, women, and children-and pushed off into the stream in full confidence in the good faith of these devils; but they had scarcely done so when, on a signal given by the Nena himself, guns were opened upon them from the bank, and out of the 40 boats they embarked in some were sunk, others set on fire, and the rest pushed over to the Onde side, where cavalry in waiting for them, in their eagerness to slay the Caffres (infidels), rode their horses belly deep into the river to meet the boats and cut and haekc at our unhappy countrymen and -women, who vainly tried to escape. One boat, however, actuaUy did manage toruntheterrlble gauntlet successfully ,and get ten miles down the river, but they were pursued, overtaken, captured, and brough back in triumph to the barracks, where the men w'ere all shot, and the women reserved for a worse fate. "Meanwhile, while unknown to the authorities at Calcutta these fearful atroities were being perpetrated at Cawnpore, every effort was being made to send Euzopean troops up the country. As fast as they came in from Madras, Ceylon, Burmah, the Isle of France, Persia, and other places, they wero packed into steamers and dak garrees(post carriages), and sent off. B;t other stations too had mutinied. Benares had been almost, Allababad entirely, in the hands of the rebels, and it was necssary to settle those twoplaces, the latter being especially necessary as the base of future operations, before any move- ment could be made upon Cawnpore. AUl this was done ai quickly as possible. Colonel Neil camo up to Allahabad, and, with the assistance of the hangman's rope, soon succeeded in restoring order at the station. As sooa as possible, he sent off a force of 400 Europeans and 000 Sikhi, under Major Renaud, in the direction of Cawnpore, and on the 10'h of July General Havel-ick, with 1,20) Europeans, folowed. I shall touch very briefly on their subsequent operations, as they will be fully described by your other correspondents. On the 12th General Hiaveloak joined Renaud, on the 13th surprised and defeated ths rebels at Fatteypore, on the 15th, again, at a nuddee 20 niles from Cawnpare, and on the 16th at Cas-upore itself, after a very obstinately contested engagement, after which th:Nena, protected by his cavalry, retreatfd upon Bithoor, wlhich is of difficult access and strongly fortified. To co:nIlote the account of the catastrophe of the unfortunate r:,mnants of the Cawnpore garrison, I may here state that the commissioner of the district reported to the Govornment that their bodies were found in a well in the Aasembly. rooms compoand, bearing upon them marks of the most in. decent and inhuman treatment it is possible to conceive. " Meanwhile Lucknow, besieged by a force variously com. puted at froui 12,000 to 20.000 men, especially strong ia eavalry, has lost its best head in Sir Henry Lawrence. That gallant officer and thorough Englishman, ag&inst his own judgment, and yielding to the entreaties of some of the civilians who were with him in the fort, made a ,ally on the 2d of July, with two companies of Her Xi. lesty's 32d Foot and the native troops who had remained faithful to him up to that moment. No sooner had he come up with the enerny than his native troops turned upon him; others attacked his rears He was compelled, therefore, to abandon his gans and fight his way back. He did this at the expense of several officers and sixty mon tilled (amongst the former Major Case, of Her Majesty's 32d Foot), and, what was of infinitely more importance, of his own valuable life. Ho was brought in mortally wounded and dieEi a few days afterwards. One consequence of this unLsuccessful sortio was that he had to abandon a great part of his defences, give up the city of Lucknow to the insurgents, and confine his efforts to the preservation of the Residency. The possibility of such a catastrophe had been foreseen, and that place been strongly fortified. Major Banks, who has succeeded Sir Henry in a political capacity, writes that he is propared to hold out for six weeks. This was written on the 8th inst. " Now, General Havelock was at Cawnpore on the 17th of July. Lucknow is 52 miles distant. le has, therefore, a futl month before him to reach that city. Let us calo. late his chances of success. "I1st. Should he cross the river at once, or march upon Bithoor ? If he prefer the former alternative we must sup. pose that the means of crossing are at his disposaL . Wewitl go further, and imagine him on the left bank of the Ganges, Ie must take his whole force with him, for he has but 1,C00 Europeans, and he has to face 20,000 men. He cannot leave a man for the proteotion of Cawnpore. What then, would be the result of his crossing at once? Why, that Cawnpore would be immediately reoccupied by the NEna with his 6,000 or 7,000 men, that he would cut offaaU Havelock's communications, meet and destroy tho 280 men advancing under Neill, and, leaving Havelock to be dealt nith by the Oade mu'ineers, march himself, avoiding Allahabad, upon the undefended Mirzaporo and Benares districts, where everything is ripe for a rebellion. It is plain, then, that General Havelock cannot advance into Oude so long as the lfena remains with his force lying on his Bank intact at Bithoor, onlv six miles distant from Cawnpore. We must inquire, then, what are his chances of success against Bithoor ? Bithoor is a very strong position, commanding the river and tho road. This latter li, s over a series of ravines artificially bridged. We mu,t suppose that the Nena has taken the precaution of breaking down the bridges. This will render ths place itself very difficult of access. lIowever, General Havelock has, as far as I can see, to make the choice between attempting a very difficult task, or leaving our countrymen at Luemnow to their fate. He i3 not the man to hesitate. The sight of our murdered, violated, and mutilated countrywomen has been quite sufficlen0, we may be sure, to infuriate our soldiers. They will dare anything in advancing against such a monster, and wo may expect to hear in a few days that he has been hanged on a turret of his own castle, and that Havelock, perfectly easy as to his communications, is in ful march to Lucknow. " The effect of such a measure and such a move would be incalculable." The following extracts from the letter of an oflicer -whose position enables him to have the be3t information, addressed to his wife in England, conItains, perhaps, the most authentic list of those who have perished. We still believe, however, that aany returned a3 murdered will be found to have escaped :- " JrLv L " A letter from Sir H. Lawrence, dated the 26th of June, with news from Cawnpore, gives the folloving:- {" Sir M. Jackson, two sisters, Mrs. Do-in, Captain Hearsey, and Captain Orr, are safe. The Cawnpore casual. ties aro Brigadier Jack, Colonel Williams, Major Prou', Sir G. Parker, Lieutenant Qain (son.), Major Lindsav, and mauy ladies; among the rest, Mrs. Wiggens died from heat and exposure. Messrs. HalUiday, Reynolds, Poole, Smith, Redmond, Supple, Eckford, Demster, Jervis, Chalvin, Hillersdon, and maDy others killed. Lieutenant Bax, 43th, killed; mos' of the Seetapore party saved. Colonel Birc'^, the Christians, Gowans, and SueUs, killed.' " This finishes Sir TI. Lawrence's letter. "The Gsvalior Contingent have risen to a man. It appears Brigadier-General Havelock, with a force, had pushed on from Allahabad as far as Futteypore, GO miles on, and exactly half way between Allababad and Cawnpore. He had expected to be opposed by rebels, but found no enemy, so he sent on men to ascertain the truth of a report of the fall of Cawnpore. They returned, said it was true, th;t General Wheeler had been wounded in the leg on Wednesday, the 2d, and on the following day was mortally wounded; t'iat most of the officess had been killed in the narrow int enchment which they held. Seeing all further resistance was useless, they surrendered. Nona Sahib barbarously murdered all the women and children, the remnant of the Cawnpore garrison, whom it appears he had kept as ho;t igcs. "A gra is gone, that is, the city is in the hands of the rebels. The Europears are, as far as we know, in the fort, which is strong enough to hold out for some time. At Saugor the Europeans are in the fort. Brigadier Sage, with great forethought, has laid in six months' provisions. At Jubbulpore there is no fort, but the Europeans have intrenched themselves in the Residency under the politic-l agent, Erskine. Fntteyghur isngone; in fact, in the central provinces we now hold Meerut, Luelmowv, Agra, and Allahabad. Tho good news is, General Havelock reports the enemy before him are running short of caps, which they cannot manufacture. The last accounts from Lucknow stated the enemy there were short of round shot, also of powder, but of this last they continue to manufacture some within the city walls. " The Eckfordnamed as killed at Cawnporo must be Ensign Eckford, of the 56th. His father, General Eckford, was, when I last heard, at Landour, in the hills. " The Jervis, too, must be an Engineer officer, as I have heard Captain Jervis, of the 56th, came home two months ago. The I'rendergast mentioned at Agra as being killed may possibly be Captain Prendergast, of the 44th, which corps was, I think, stationed at Agra." THE BATTLE OF AGRA. The following is the copy of a letterxreceived from a gallant young oflicer of the 3d Europeans "Agra, July 16. "My dearest Mother,-I wonder whether this wil ever reach you. I trust it will, as it Will tcll you that, after a very severe engagement, 'oy the merciful protection of 1rovidence I am well, and have escaped untouched, although my position, liko that of most others, was very critical, and I had sevoral narrow esapes. My former letters will have told you that every European in India is so far in danger that he must fight for his life, and lucky are those who have to meet their death or escape it in open fight. I know not how tho press is depicting our present state in India; but in the North-West we cannot call an inch of ground our own except what we stand on. With small bands of Europeans scattered in isolated positions, and unable to unite for our mitual protection, we are surronnded by mutinous regi. inents of infantry and cavalry and batteries of artil. lery, armed with our weapons, provided with our ammunition, and taught and disciplined by otirselves. Our difficulties, too, are materially increased by such numbers of women, and children, and helpless people, wlhom we cannot leave, as thoy kil unsparingly every European and Christian that Is unprotected. But I must not dwell on the difficulties which baffle us and retard our euccess, nor yet on the causes to which we owe our present disasters. Let me try rather to give you some details about n.y first time under fire. Two days before this action we ascertained, what we had long expected, that the Neemuch mutineers were at a place 22 miles from us, consisting of the 72d Native Infantry, 7th G walior Contingent (infantry), three troops 1st Bengal Light Cavalry, the cavalry of United MaIwa Contingent, who joined them at Mchidpoor (killing their two offioers), and a battery of native horso artillery. Our oivil lines were accordingly vacated, the inhabitants withdrawing to the fort, and the LieutenantGovernor went down to live in cantonmcnts. The next day, as the enemy had such a large force of cavalry, amd wl none, we thought it likely they might send their So"rs (horsemen) te plunder and burn the cantonments; go our detaohments were called in to head-quarters. There was alsO one o mtingent (Kotai) which had been marched tSp from the santh-west to our aid, as thoy wore coneidered loyal and fai%hful, and amid aU these defoctions had for a month remaii.ed trae, collecting revenue for us, bunei6g disaffected villages, and hanging mutineers and rebels; 'se we had brought them in to be ready to go ont with us, iF nO. cessary, against the Neemuch mutineers ; and they were eno mped half-way between Government-house and our barracks, and a detachment of them relieved me the day before from my post at Government-house, after the Lieu. tenant-Governor 1Fft it. No sooner had I returned to cantonments than a heavy down-pour came on, and we were simultaneously ordered to arms; out we went, and found that the Kotah Contingent (cavalry), as soon as they had reached their encampment, had fired on their officers and killed their sergeant-major ; and after them tho infantry and artilery also had bolted, all but two faithful native gunners, who had spiked the guns which they had been obliged to leave behind them. We were ordered at once to go and capture the guns; and so this Kotah mutiny disconcerted our movements, as we had already received orders to hold ourselves in readiness to march out that evening to attack the Neemuchb force. We started forthwith about 7, all drenched to the Wkn, and got back safe, guns and all, about 9. About 10 next day, July 5, the Neemuch force was reported only foar miles off; so in less than two hours we were on the march to meet them, after despatching vwhat we could of our traps into the fort. About half-way on we halted and served oat grog to our men, but, hearing the enemy vere forming, we had to stop in the middle and go ahead. As we pss£ed through the village Shahgunge, jus. outside the civil lines, our men moved onward, singing and giving lusty cheers, such as none but Britons can. Wo then formed line with half the battery on each flank, and to protect them, al ! we had none but a few volunteers of Militia Cavalry, composed of offlcers of mutinied regiments, civilians, merchants, and vrriters, all of whom did their best, bht with untrained horses, and without cavalry drill, they were a poor subatitute for disciplined trooper Besides these volunteer horsemen our force consisted of seven com. panies 3d BEropean Regiment (three companies amounting to 200 men being our only garrison to hold the fort), and one battery of artillery, comrnmanded by poor D'Oyly, and our whole force did not amount to more than 500 men, against God knows how many thousands of the enemv. They say they bad 5,000 infantry and fully 1,000 (if not more) cavalry, and eight guns, six being of the H ArtiUery battery. After forming we advanced, and the enemy kept retiring, and we continued following till they got to a village, whea from behind this they sent their first round shot just b;ng tver the colours, which, as senior ensign, I was carrying, and along with it came several musket shots, the sharp pinging of which remintded us of the rifle company of the 72d, which we had often seen drawn up by our side oa the grand parade ground here. We were ordered to lie dowa while the artillery played on this village, in which numbers of the infantry secreted themselves, Sring at us from behind the walls, while their artillery and main army were planted in the rear of it. They had a very strong and commanding position, and their rifles did much execution, as also the grape which they kept firing against our guns. We advanced a little, and lay down again two o- three tin es, when out burst their cavalry in such numbers that they completely surrounded us, and tried to get at our baggage, spare ammunition, &c., but our volunteer horseman bravely managed to keep them off. Onr small body was theu broken up into three divisions-the main one to attack the village, another to protect onr right baef battery, and one company with head-quarters and colours to defend the left half battery, where, of course, I was; aud being just in front of the village we were exposci to the fire of these riflemen, hidden behind mud walls. Soon after we were in position one of our gun carriages took fira, and when we came up It was in felU blaze, one of our tumbrils having been blown up. Just after this we saw the cavalry again coming down upon us, sa we faced about, and the cowardly wretches, instead of charging fnUll a us, swerved and galloped past, we the meanswhile letting a volley into ihem. Oh I it was a fine sight to see them rolling over off their horses, In the village they had very sharp work, and the severest loss in charging up it; the first voUey knockol over our major; he was wounded in the foot, and his horse, received three baUls and fell over upon and injured his head. When our brave boys wero well into the village they dealb destruction on all sides, and the enemy, after a faint resistence, fled in confusion. They were drawing off in full force, wbh-n an unlucky shot of theirs exploded another of our ammunitioni waggons, and on seeing this they set up a lou clamour and rallied for awhile; however, we went on firing till vre h Ad expended all our gun ammunition which had not been blown up, and then, being helpless, we had to burn the village, form up our force, and retreat. The want of ammunition was most unfortunate for us, as the enemy wera getting short of it, too, and had begun firing pice (farthing;) and bits of stone, so that a few more rounds rwold havo given us a decided victory, instead of leaving it a half-andhalf business, but such are the chances of war. "A About the middle of the action, which lasted one hour and three-quarters, poor D'Oyly was wounded by a grapa shot in the right side. ilis horse was shot under him very early, and he was stooping down putting his shoulder to the wheel to extricate one of his guns vhen he was wounded poor fellow, mortally. He was brounht in, and after lin,gering in great pain 2S hours he died on tha evening of the Gth. He was much belovedi bJ all, aad truly sorry wore we to lose at such a time so geod an officer and so nice aud kind and gentlenanuly a fellow.. When wounded he sot down on one of the ga-ss rnd went on giving his orders, tiU at last the pain was to, much for him, and he said, 'I h ' they have done for m J now ' Put a stone over my grave, and say I died fight.. g my guns.' Hoehad many friends; and afterho was brough1 in to Captain Machell's, a brother officer's hoase, ha I:ad two or three ladies constaatly attending him, as also his -ubaltern (young Griffin), and other friends. The next day after we came in I went to see himi, but he was hardly conmcious, though ho stUI spoke in his own kind gentleminly way. "But to revert to the sequel of the battle. Daring our retreat the enemy follo wed us with one gun aU the way int 3 the city, and the cavalry were upon both our flanks as long as we were in open ground, bnt took care not to come iwithin,reach of the fort guns. The very lact shot fi-ed from this one gun (which appears was the only one lest that they could move about) came jast over the colours, and kiled two men siot eight yards in front of me. .And one thing is certain, if their cavalry had had one grain of pluck they might have cut us up almost to a man. One time, towards the clnse of tho action, somue dozen of tbom galloped in actuaUy between the company I was wit'i and the guns we vere protecting, and cut down several of our volunteer horsemeu; we had to form our company int) three sides of a square and stand till thoy came at us. bun tbey never did. Oar loss was very'great-30 killed, and 3 officers and 02 men wounded, of whom S have since died, ani 2 others of sunstroke to-day. Tho Artillery lost :3 killed an 1 17 wounded, among whom were 2 officers, poor D'Oyly(sine d ad) and Captain Lamb, whose recovery is most douhtfulOf tho Militia and volunteers 6 -veretkiled and 15 wounded of whom S wero officers and civilians. Total loss: -killed oa died of wounds, 51; wour.ded, 90; out of about 503 en. Iaged. Is not this a bloody action for our first essay? Tho enemy's loss ls said bythemselvesto havebeen over 500, and we 'piked one of their guns. Fancy, in the village tho v omen loaded the men's muskets and thanded them to th3 men to fire. Soon after we returned to the fort ths whole of the bungalows (houses) were in flames. and a grand sightit was, too. The enemy, we hear expected we had had gone back for ammurAtion and were coming out against them next day, and so off they belted and went in the direction of MIuttra, and never came on here at all; it was our own servants and blackguards in Augra who plundered aU the houses and fired them. Numbers havo lost everything thoy had in the world, even to their evetyday kit, which their servants decamped with, when on the 5th they were told to take them into the fort, MIy servants, happily, have behaved well; my kidmutgar accompanied mne to the field of ation and stuck to me all through, and my bearer brought my bed and traps safe, and I had a pil. low, &c., to rest my weary limbs on that night. For the first three days after the action we were badly off, as nearly &1l the rerv ants bad bolted, but after that they began to dro? in back again. I have, indoed, much cause for thankfulnes3 to be comparatively so well off, with something saved, my servants at hand, and, above all, a strong healthy frame, unimpaired by hard work and by God's mercy uninjured by the enemy. May I be Spared to fght mT country's battles, to execute just judgments on these ungratefal -nurderous traitors ! I had two remarkably narrow escpes; one was a rifle ball which just struck the ground at my feet, the other occurred while I was stooping down to get a drink of filthy water hard by, when foutr rifle ahots (ntered the groubd close behind me, one of them wh;z. sIng past Mny left ear, a precious sight too oloee. We are all now in tho fort, and no danger in progpect at present;. all our enemies far away, and we making every preparation against the worst; plenty of hard work. Send us lots of Englishmen, that we may have a good winter campaign. -"B.V B." THE MUTINY AT SEALKOTE. The following is from anx oTcer of the Bengal Cavalry "Lashore, July 13.

TNDOR,P. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI!ES. Sir,-Feeling that you will be glad to mak known to the public such additional facts as prove the good faith of Holkar, the Malxratta chief of Indore and the adjacent country, I rejoice in being able to place at your disposal au extract of a letter dated the 21st of July from Mhow, written by my son, who had medical charge of the station of Bhopawur, within 60 rmiles of Indore, and of the Bheel corps located there. Should you deem the extract worthy of insertion, you can publish it, whole or in part, at your pleasure. I am, Sir, yours respectflly, AN OLD INTDIAN OFFICER. "I will endeavour to deseribe to you the ocourrence3 which have brought me to this sad pas. Yon may remember that I returned from Indore to Bhopawur aboat the middle of June; at that time I left Indore perfectly quiet, and there was no suspicion of any mischief taking place. But in the dark a treacherous plot was brewing, which hbas brought down ruin on us all. A portion of Hlolkaes troops attacked the Residency; the Contingent troops joined them, with the exception of the Bheel corps, but the latter, being thus left alone, were unable to resist and ran away. " As soon as the news of the affair at Indore was known It spread like wildfire through the country that Holkar had attacked the Britsh, and all prepared to join him. Happily the rumour was false, for It was only a portion of his troops that had done so, and that against his wilU; in truth, they had mutinied like our own men. Holkat himself remained true, as you will find, and to his assistance our party are, humanly spealing, indebted for our lives. Bat the rumour was not contradicted till too late for us at Bhopawar. A neighbouring chief, caUed the Rajah of Umjheerra, thought it a fLne thing to follow Holkir's example, or what he thought to be sueh, and without the slightest provocation or warning sent his troops to attack our little station. We heard, however, of their approach. I Imme "Notes explanatory of Indian terms, 8;c.:"1L-'Ka.h admee'-black men ; natives.

I then sent to Lieuatenant flutchinson, the political officer, who was living three miles away, and told him what I had done, reoommending him to join me and make a stand *t the linea of the Bheel corps. He acoordingly came down with his family. All thia occurred on the evening of the 2d ef July. Night came without the appeance of the enemy. The men lay down at their poste, and I slept at the quartergguard. In the night, however, the cowardly Bheels took advantage of the darkness to desert, and by 2 o'cock in the morning not 20 of them remained, and it was evident from their I conduct that tbese 20 did not mean to fight. What couald we then do? We knew that no mercy would be shown us by the villains coming from Umajbeerra, and as it was hopeless to attempt any defence after the desertion of our men wo determined to fly, and thus endeavour to save the ladies and children. Accordingly, having made what little preparations we could, we left the place aboat half-piat 4 on the morning of the 3d of July, our little party consisting of Lieutenant and Mrs. Hutchinson and child, Mr Colonel 0tockley and four children, and myself Scarcely any of our servants followed us, and not one of the faithless Bheel corps would accompany our party for the protection of their Co]onel's wife and childron. Of all my own servants only one came along with me, and he ran away the first night afterwards. The rest not only deserted me, but helped themselves to whatever they could lay their hands on. Such were the miserable circuTstances under which we took our departure, and, excepting for the Providence of God, the prospect of escape was as hope3ess as could well he, for the neareat Britilsh post towards which we could ma1k our way was ne arly 200 miles away. "H ardly had we tmrned our backs on the station ere It wsa taken possession of by the Umjheerra people. I uppoee they were at irAt too busy plunderingto think of us, x=d we continued topush on. In the afternuon we had got abeut 15 miles away, having travelled over slhcking roads. Our cattle were quite knocked up and we wers obliged to halt. Happily for us the spot which we had reached was in the state of a petty chief galled the Ba;hja of Jabw^. Aboutj an hour after w e had halted we were overtaken by a party sent ih putsuit of us from Bhopawur. We gave ourselve, up for lost, but Lieutenat Hutchinson and mny3lf preI pared to sell our lives u dearly a we could. Fortunately, we were well armed, having lye guns between us. Our reaolution probably deterred the illains from malkng an open attaek upon us, for they knew we should in a} li}elihood knock over some of them. They thought we should endeavour to escape as soon asit got *ark, andin the hopes of killing -s without any risk to themselves the scound2as took up their position about a quarter of a mile in advanc, at a very difficult and broken part of the road, where thejungle camc down to the edge ens both aides and affo:ded them every faclity for their murderous purposes. This we only discoverae melt morning, but in the meantime, knowing that there were more than a dozen of them, hore and foot,we every moment expected their attack. Fatlged as we were, Lieutenant Huts-hinson and myself kept watch all night, hour and hour about, each awaldmg his cempanlon (if he Elept) at the sihtest cause for alanm. 'Ye may Imagine low dreadful a n,Skt the poor ladies-passed indeed, few of our party wil be disposed, I fancy, ever to forget it. Nothing but jzne aill round, one miserable hut within sight, belonging to. some dak runne, deeerted again by I the few people who. aecompanied us se-far frehn Bhopawur, and a band of asaoeins at hand thimbing for our blood, where could wee lbek to for aid but to Him whose mercifal hand did shield us in that howe of danger ? I told yow that we had ju;t entered the State ef the Rajah of Jaiwa. A Bheel, whe had observedt what was going on1 earried intellipnce to the nearedt town, a amalj pLW* called Par&, of the invasion by the Umjheerra people. Firing at the insult, a party started from Para to drive them away. Just as the gray of the morning appeared we had the pleasure of being rescued by them, and thus- did God raise upp Instraments for our delivey when death seemed near athenad. But had the-villains not been such cowards nothing eod have saved us, if they kad attaoked us in the night. This fresh party carie us tePar, and were civil enough at first, but towards evening, for some-reason or other, they began to get vein insolet and commenced plundering us We saw our position bad but I ittle improved, ad wepzepared again to-sell our livre as dealy; as could be. But just as tbhing ppeared to be getting desperate a pary arrived from Jaibva, 1@ miles away, sent by the chief to our rescue as soon as he had keard of our being at Para. They carried us to Jabwa that sam, evening, and wo reache& the town. early iu the omaing, havingrestedforsomehours on the zed. The young cldef, who is a ver pleasing-looking boy of 16 or 17, received us very kindly. The maaging authority, however, is an old lady, who is, i Wlieve, grandmother to the chief, and by her directions everything that could be done for our safety or comfort was effectedL To protect us, however, was as much as soe could do% for there were a number of Arabs and men of tlat class in the employ of tho chief, and thess- fanatics loulay demanded our aurrender that they might put us to death, The family themselves are PRaipoots, and hla fortunately a number of Rajpoot retainers about them. To these they assigned our protection, and faithfully did they exocute their trust. Not a Mussulman Sepoy ws allowed to apprOach our quarters in the palace, and there we waited patiently for eight days for assistance from some quarter or other. Lieutenant Hutchinson wrote to the Resident at Barod to send aid to us, and this he did. Bat long before that could reach us Holkar had done all that vas necessary. I must tell you that rs Hutchinson is a daughter of Sir Robert Hamilton, and Holkarprofewses the greatest friendship for that family. The first intelligeuce that reached him was that the lajah of Umjheerra had made us prisoners. He instantly despatched some of his chief officers, with a strong force, giving them particular orders to recover us, and blow the town of Umjheerra to pieces. In the meantime he received the true intelligence of our being at Jabwa, the chief of which Is one of his tributarie. He sent him a despatch to say that If a hair of our heads was injured the chief should answer for it; and that in a few days his cavalry would reach Jabwa to ourrescue. They did so, andescorted us back to Bhopawur, where we remained for a couple of days. What a change from its former neat appearance did every house present I From Bhopawur we intended to go into Iudore, where Elolkar had kindly preparedrooms for us in his palace. 3Bathearingthatmauy of his troops were stiU in avery agitated state, and that the Mussulmans in the city were ripe for mischief, we turned off and came in here, thinking it more prudent, both on Holkar's account and our ovn. We arrived on the night of the 16th of July, thanking God for His mercy to us during so many days of danger."
BENARES. The following has been received from R. H. Bartrum, of the 3d Oude Irregular Infantry, previously stationed at Gondalos- " Benares, July 13. "I have writtentoyon several previous letters,but I don't know whether they will have reached you, so unoertain now is the poet; my last was from Aziseghur. On the road to Ghazeepore a European soldier and an old Colonel, with his wife and daughter, joined ns; they had escaped from Fyzx. bad, and bad passed through the greatest horrors. The sergeant was the only survivor of about 17, six of whom he saw killed around him by vfillagers; he was subsequently released, on account of a party of Europeansaeing expected, after having been tortured and having heard the proposal of his own burning discussed; the poor man nearly lost his senses under the triaL " While travelUing over the fine roads and tho splendid bridges with which this neighbourhood abounds, and, at the tame time, knowing that the valuo of the land has doubled, I cannot help refuting the ides that this affair is a retaliation for1 English deeds; for those who hAve profited the moat by our rule have shown themselves the most inhuman. People said that missionaries ought to be excluded, and at Bareilly it is reported that the Commander of the station trned thsm out of the place in deference to the Sepoys; these latter, however, rose and, it is said, massacred the Europeans. I hope, when the oountry is resettled and thoroughly reconquLered, and when these horrors have been properly avenged, that many more missionaries may bo aent out. "The day before yesterdays we received accounts of an unsuccessful sally from Lucknow by a European party, in company with native artillery and cavalry. These deserted, and the Europeans had to fight their way back, with loes, eight miles to the dty. It was stated that, from being obliged to concentrate their position, they would have to leave stores of ammunitlon and provisions upon whieh thay had been depending. This account .was dated the 30th Though this state of things I so panul, yet hope of relief remains, for forces hae lleft Ailahabad some time, and by cer latesi intelligenoe had reached Cawupore They arrived unfortunately too late to prevent the entire massacre of the English there, They are now ordered to proceed to the relief of Lticknow wiout aun Inxtant's delay. If matters come to the worst the fozoe there is ong enough, I think, to make good Its retreat, although the great nuamber of ladies and children they have to defend weuld be a conaiderable impediment. If tbe Allahabad column reachea in time they will be comfortable in every respect, as there are mAUY good houses in which the ladies can remain, but I fea for the effect the anxieties and hardship3 will have %Xpn my poT lb'u beh.

The Europeans at Luclnow met the Sepoy foroe again, and reversed the result of their first meeting. Our accounts tell us that they beat them with comparatively no loss, and with great slaughter; snd not only this, but that General Havelock met 8,000 Sepoys a short way from Cawopore, and took from them 11 guns, all they had, sed that be would be at Lucknow with a large force of artilley and 2,000 men on the 21st. Indeed, within three daya the state of things has changed in the most remarkable manner; for then, with Lucknov in danger and Cawnpore in the hands of the mutineers, it seemed as if we might have to leave aUl these posts and betake ourselves to Allshabad as a laot resort, previous to the arrival of strong reinforoeaseti from England. How thankful we ought to be at this happ7 change ! It was only yesterday that we got news of the miserable plight of tbe mutineers in Delhi. I aszure you that the tales of horrors that we have had daily to hear have been more than heartzending. The 3tory never canbe toldit is impossible to realize. The greatest bratalities thAt Easrn vice can invent have been practised upon English Ladies and children. Yo n my Imagne my anxiety at hearing that Lumknow could bold out only 10 or 15 days longer, but now all that has ceasea, and on that score I am at ease. "Time will show the effeats of this rmtiny upon India generally, Importing a lare number of Buropeans into the country will, I hope, g*vo a different face to it, as yetk Instead of the Hindoos and Musulmans beoming ehanged, the Engish have become more Asiatic; railways will be more pusbed forward, missionaries w, I hope, bo more numerous, fer though we laugh at the people here the religious example ismost decidedly on their side-indeed, though the trial hao been a severe one, yet I have great hupes that it will encl in the best mtnner for the country.

TO TRE BDTOR OF TRM TM-'IM Sir,-Amid all the aco*anmt of native Techery tbh pouLr in I am happy to be able- to tellyot of one exception, soBa tLmunieAed to me by my brother the judge of Bena,r, of whom sene favourable mention has been made in the correspondewe you have published thence. R4jah Zoorut Sing, a Sikh chieftain, who- was living at tBenarea under a slight sarveilance at tffe time of the mutiny, ad who was on i;timate terms with my brothey, used his rxertiona sucoessfmlly to keep a company of his countrymn steady who wera on guard at the Mint, where all'the ladies and children were collected, and ha& sinco proved himself so bra-e and trne that the Europeans have su6tcibed 1031., in order to ptesent him with- a handsome setof fiarems. It may ao be pleasing to yoL to knovr that the murder of poor Moore was speedily avenged. The villkges- were burn% and 60 or more of the inhabitants, who hd threaW ened t'ooome down on Benares with 5,000 men, cut to-plecee. I am, your, faithfully, .rnA,T P fNrerDva BhualI Mold, Aug. 31L The,following letter from a young civilia. in. the Punjab. district describes the beginning of the mutiny and the conveyance of the first news of it to the late General Anson " Camp Dadoopore, June-2L "You.lenow we had a sUght row at Umballah on Sunday, the lOthof May-the same day thtA the feerut row took place. Butt we were more fortunato than the people, at Meerut; though 'we had not so large aa European force. Boththe intsutry (native)regiments came out withoutorders and, after th7eatening to shoot some of their ofcers, were persuaded to return to their alies by the presence of the ar tmery with lighted port-fires, and of the 9th Laners 3(Euro. peans). OnMoncdly we received the painful news of what was going onakl1elhi. It was heartrending toknow that our coun. tmen and countrywomen wero actually being mzurdered at the very moment we received the intelligence. The news came ia by eectric telegraph. There was something pitiable In the mesege of some three lines,-' fntineersfrom 3feart come In, niaseacreing everyEuropes. We must step!' That ' We ust stop' was the most, grievous sentence I had ever read. So passed Monday; all quiet with us. Towards afternoon we received another meFage, mentioning the names of sonme of the unfortunates. fOn. bTtesday came the news from Meerut, which took longer in coming, as it had to comoeby post instead of teograph. But it vas not a quiet night that we pase&at Umballah. We hai intelligence, which, thank God, tuarned outt to be fese, that on this night all the natives were to.iss. Though three miles from cantonments, we were best of at the civiLlines, as we had only our 'Teasury guard of about 50 men of the 5th Native Infantry to dread, while we- ad 200 faithful Slkhs to back us up. We patrolled the ity all night, and the people in the cantonments kept a sbarplock oun'. All was quiet. But it seemed to us, in our e=%ament, a quiet of ill omen. " On. Monday the Commander-in-Chief, who was up, at Simlab, about 90 miles from llbUallah, was written to to send down troops at oncefrom, the hills, wlhere tSr regl mentsof Europeans are stationed. " On Tresday the first of tha Delhi fugitives cam reeplng In, and on Wednesday everning there came aa lettab from a small band of miserables wh& were eollected at KBrnaul1 80 miles from Delhl, whence they had escaped, asking for aid. Thie letter, and another calling for immediate assistance In Buropeaus, I volunteered to take up to the Commander-inCbief at Simla, and, after a hot ride through the heat of the day and the best part of the night, I reached the Coammander-in-Chief at about half-past 4 in the morning of Thursday. I turned him out of bed; they held a council of war, and at half-past 10 wo were all riding back again. On reaching the foot of the hills I knocked up, the sun and want of sleep for two nights, added to a ride of 130 miles, having been too much for me. By this time the last European had left the hills, and on 3anday morning all were cantoned in UImballah. They came dowvn 1 ravely, notwithstanding the heat, al eager to revenge their comrades. I reached Umballah myself on the Saturday. But in the meanwhile, though secare at Umballah. the districts round Dolhi and betweon Meerut and Umbalah wore frightfully expo3ed. You have by this time seen the end of that exposure; how, in some cases, all the Buropeans in a station were murdered, how the treasuries were robbed and the towns sacked, whilo in others they were more for'nnate. Towards Umballah disorganization was rapidly spreading from that contaminating spot eemrut, while towards Agra the example of Delhi was proving equally hurtfuL It was agreod, then, at hoed-quarters that a pasty should be sent to tranquillize the country between UIballah and Meerut, wh1le the party attacking Delhi would restore confidence to the coantry they passed along betwoen Umn ballah and DlhL. I volunteered for this duty, as a eivilian was required to work the party. A squadron of the 4th Cavalry was placed at my diu posal and two companies of our mutinous frleuds, the 5th Native Infantry, with them. I have beon rashing about the courtry np to the present time. If it has had its discomforts, our life in tho jungle has not been without its excitement. What with attacking predatory tribes, who have taken advantage of tUe confusion to plunder, and burnIng down their villages, making raids upon self-elected kings in the middle of the nigbt, only to find the valiant monarchs flown, our work has not allowed us to remuin idle. I have seen the first of war, though on a mimio scale. It is r ot a pleasant sight. I should like, however, I must cortfess, to have seen the attck on Delhi, and to have participated in it. No man can help sharing the same wish. The atrocities these brutes have committed have aroused in every breast that thirst for blood which forms the baser part of man's character. In addition to our foraging expeditions our mutinous friends gave us some further exciement. Three dals ago, on the 2d, they got up a mutiny on their own aco0unt whilo we were at Saharunporo. I had, I believo, a narrow escape. The ringleader pointed his musket at me as I came up to him to tell him to drop his arms, and said he would shoot me. He changed his mind, and did not, but shot at Captain Wyld instead, who was going across to bring the caaslry over. The good men of the company bebaved well, and we succeeded in shooting one of the matLseer as he was running forwvard to shoot Wyld-a just retribution. All thia has taught us caution. I was una.med, as well as the three other offlome present. lad I only had a revolver I might have shot the singleeder on his preweting his piece-he was wi#ihn fire yarda of me-and thus hawv got rid of the wovat mas, and probably pat a stop to the affair. George Plowden, of tbe cavalIy, who was coming home from his dsive witb two othor young fellows, was shot at by thee villains, us were his two companions also. However, they are eretched bad shots, and no one waa touched. We have purged tho company of the bad men now. All the snobs bolted with the bad ones, so tha there is nothing to fear from the men with U& I bAve rethrRqd from the Saharnporo district, having purified it, sd aot now back again in my own district. Very severe me ,rg are the order of the day. Yesterday I hung a mAn to the nearest tree for bavlng pne out armed with a part a plundering expedition. Bat these are times in which no morbid feelinp can be allowed to affeot our decisions To such barbarians a theee men have proved themelveg barbarous justioe must bo administered. They have no claim on us for anything beyond thix. "Camp Jugadhree, Tuly 8.

ACCIDINTS FROM FOWLING.PIECES, TO, TEEE EDITOR OF TIlE TIMES. SEr,-It is-truly lamentable to read of accddents and deoahh like that of Mr. Platt, recorded in your Saturday's imnsesaion, and hoaded " A Member of Parliament Shot,' ginon it is certain tMat nine-tenths of all that happen might be pre. vented. For humanity's sake, pray use yeur gigantic means to drw public attention .and particulrly t of sportsmen, to the subject befvre us. Examino the din. grams I send you, and you wil perceive that foe the expense of a half-crown, and without the slightestiejury. disight, or inconvenience to the sportsman, his gun may be carried and used without the least danger to himsolf or his companions in the field. Pray let it be known that I am neither a gunsmith nor an undertaker, and have no other Interest in what I recommend than honest sympathy aniL fellovi4eeling. It is now seven years ago ~since I fusat made attempts to draw the attention of the public most.conoerned to th&i species of homicide, and the means of prevernting it. Durg that period I have reckoned between 70 a:-d 80 fatal crses. I have publisbed descriptive diagrams, and written some dozens of letters to persons cither the friends of the victims or the perpetrators of the mischief. home repl'e6 Lnd some few thanks have reached mne, and it is possible that some little good hua been done- but old bAhits aro st preferred to innovation, and a few deaths are act sufficient to justify any rational alarm, or the trouble ol making any change in the instrument that ought to excite it One ofthe sapient tradesmen with whom I communicated replied to me Ithat "safety locks were getting outoffahion." Anoldsportsman to whom I recommended some light filligree work as a covering for one gide of the guard which protects the trigger, smiling with some self-complacency, replied that "he saw no good in It, since it could only prevent half the accidents that happened in thAt way, and not all of tbem." The folly of using the percussion sun under ordi. nary crumstances may be compare to that of a mau using a keg of gunpowder for A Jootstoo], pUtting it before the fire, and knocking out the ashes of bis pipe upon it. To carry a gun full-cocked is ins%ne, half-cocked is but little better, and to leave the cock tr hammer resting Lnd pressing and coasolidasing the fulmiZ nating composition in the cap upon the nipple is Idiotic, criminal, and atrocious. When this is the case the slightest blow will explode the cap. Bat the fertilo source of all mischief is the accidentally lifting the cock ba a degree something short of the hlf-cock, and then letting it fall, vhich in most cases will cause an explosion. Now, Sir, what in the name of commox sense is a remedy fc- tbis evil? It is this, so to contrive te machinery of the locr that the hammer er oock hangs over the cap enough to DrO, itt it and prevent ita ecape and at the same t'gme Co.s not press npon or touch it. You wlU ask howl thiss lto be done. I wl tell you-it is the esert and the loat efficient thing posible. Let a bole be drilled and a soft iron pin inserted into it, the head of which is to project 1 16tit of an inch it that semi-circular plate or roUer to which the eock (out. side) is attached, and in which notchee aTo eut to catoh the point, which is detacbed from them by neans of the trigger. Let this pin be so inserted that it catches this point exactly at the place where it will hold and prevent the cock resting upon the cap, bat, on the contrary, koop It suspended about the eighth of an inch. If this be done, will it not be clear that ro blowr nor fall, nor lifting and lettinr fall the cock, can ever fire the gunu and causo one ol thoso aocidents that so frequently kappen? But, 1o.l will ask, how is the gtn to be fired if this pin catchea the cock in its descent and prevents it falling upon the cap? I answer, by holding back th tigger by the figae, as everybod:T does in shooting. It s In thr tbat the mrit of the contan consts By this it is shown tha the gun cCannt be dischaged but 6 the proper way, ola lx the hands, and the trigger initkilonally pulled by tba hnge,. It nay not bo Improper temark that saumher of sfety looks have been invented. but all demand that the aports. man sbould learn theix as; this is an objectioa.

LONDOM, WEDNESDAY, SBPTEMBE.B 2, 1857. The warm encomium paid in the Royal Speech to the heroism of our countrymen in India eypresses sentiments pervading all classes of the nation. If anything, indeed, could relieve the affliction experienced at the dreadful massacres which are reported, it would be found in the courage and conduct which under circumstances of such trying severity have been almost uniformly displayed. Terrible as is the character of regular warfare, its horrors are as nothing when compared with the shocks which Englisbmen in India have sustained. In war the daily business is one of death ; the contingencies are known and accepted beforehan;l; the chances of the game are evenly clivided; if there is danger to be encountered there is honour to be won; a code of recognized usages mitigates the law of the sword, and, above all, it is rarely that a soldier has to contemplate the sufferings of those whose life is more precious to him than his own. In India these conditions of action were all reversed. Ouir countrymen were abruptly surprised amid the ordinary avocations -of peace by the outburst of something infinitely worse than war. At a moment's notice they were called rpon to defend, not only themselves, but their wvives and children, against the ferocious attacks, not of a legitimate enemy, but of the very troops under their own command. As if by a stroke of magic, the men with whom a few hours earlier they had been consorting on terms of amity, or in the interchange of dutics, were converted into foes set upon rapine and muirder-foes acknowedging no instiacts of clemency and recognizir g no laws of war. One day our countrymen were in profound peace, the next they were fighting ft r their lives against a horde of ruffians bent upon ,their extermination. To find a parallel for much a position would be a work of difficulty. Perhaps the closest comparison might be drawn -from the bloody onslaughts of the Red Indians upon the early settlers of America; but even this illustration fails, for the red men were not inhabitants of the settlement itself, or inmates -of its dwelling-houses. They came as regular 4nemies from their own camping-grounds on expe-ditions of war, whereas in India the savages were -the paid soldiers of their intended victims. If a writer of fiction were to imagine the circumstances qmder which the national fortitude of a body of men .could be most severely tried, he could hardly invent -conditions more calculated for the test than those 'nder which our countrymen have been surprised iu Hindostan. Most nobly have they stood the trial. There i scarcely a xtation in Bengal at which heroism 1i not been shown as splendid and as dauntless as that which we admire in the early history of our Indian conquests. There are CLIvEs, -we verily believe, to be found in every garrison in India, and found even, as CiavE was found, amcng the civilians It deserves especially to be noticed that many of the acts of intrepidity recorded were performcd by men who were not soldiers, but Englishmen only, and who yet came forth with all credit and honour from scenes like these. WYomen, too, have conducted themselves with the most invincible fortitude, sharing the perils and privations of thoir protectors, and steadfastly supporting, in the sufferings of a flight or a siege, trials wlhich miight well be considered unendurable. Row ladies delicately nurtured, and enfeebled even beyond their natural weakness by the climate of ELiiidostan, could have survived such hardships as usually attended an escape from the scene of murder has appeared inconceivable even to Indians themselves. There has been no faintheartedness anywhereneither amongofficers robbedof theirmen,nor among civilians transformed suddenly into soldiers. In every instance we see the coolness and courage of the Anglo-Saxon race. Our countrymen meet the (ails of this murderous surprise as they would do those of any ordinary duty. If there is a fort in the place, they retire to it with the women and children, extemporize defences, invent substitutes for all that is lacking, and hold out to the last. If there is no place of protection and no resource but flight, man and wife run the gauntlet together through the swarms of murderers around them, and either save their lives or sell them dearly. If there is anythiDg like a chance of fighting on an open field no odds are refused, nor have any hitherto proved too great to be overcome. Even the sortie from Agra, though in the engagement which followed the rebels had 1,200 horse and the British only 18,-and those volunteers,-was neither without honour nor without success. Captain IYOYLY'S death in this combat was as glorious as any at Inkermann or Alma. Though mortaUy wounded, he sat upon a tumbril and continued to give the word of command to his artiUery until the scanty ammunition of the little army was exhausted. The first prospect before the eyes of aU on these terrible occasions must have been that of inevitable death; indeed, we know from the letters of the survivors that this was actually the case. But, though destruction thus stared thema in the face, the condition seems to have been calmly accepted, with the resolfition only to better it, as far as PROVIDENCE might grant, by courage and self-reliance. In no instance have Englishmen been wanting to themselves. They have either escaped death by dexterity and daring, or encountered it like Christians and soldiers. The dangers and the horrors were a thousand times as great as those of a pitched battle, and yet they were faced with a determination and selfpossession which went far to disarm them. It has been the same in the field. Although for some time the mass of mutineers in Delhi must have outnumbered our little force as largely as the particular bands of murderers did the European inmates of a station, we have never been otherwise than victorious in a combat. The rebels come out against us five to one in number, and fight as men fight with halters round their necks and the black fag flying over their heads, but the discipline which they retain from our instruction and the despair which they imbibe from their situation are vain together. We are told, indeed, that the same men will never venture twice against the bayonets of the British liues, but that each successive sortie represents an accession of traitors, who have been admitted to share the quarters of the garrison upon condition of going out once to battle. It will be strange indeed if, after such a manifestation of national valour, our power in India should not be stronger than before. We trust the assurances of sympathy and support which every mail will convey to our countrymen in the East may help to nerve their arms and their hearts for successful action. It is something more than condolence that we offer. We pay a tribute to their bravery bv merited acknowledgments; we will relieve their losses by substantial aid; but, beyond and above all this, we despatch to their succour such forces as are little likely to find a match in the demoralized battalions of a mutinous and dismembered army. There is but one feeling in England as to their deserts, or those of their assailants. We have no Peace Party on this occasion, and if squeamishness or irresolution were ever felt in any quarter as to the propriety of retribution such sentiments must have been demolished by the intelligence of the last mail. There may have been mistakes in the organization of the Bengal Army or the policy of the Bengal Government, but these are considerations utterly beside the question. Our immediate duties lie in a very narrow compass. We have to deal with foul treason and atrocious murder, to assert British power and re-establish British rights; and the whole world shall see that we know how to set about the work.
The Proclamation of the mutineers from Delhi adlopts distinctly and expressly the religious ground as the ground of the present Mutiny. It is, indeed, considered in this light, a very grotesque document, being, as it is, a joint issue from two opposite religious bodies that hate each other. These two -Mahomedan and Hindoo-have nothing in common. The whole creed of Mahomedanism Is a protest against idol worship, which is the very essence of Brahminism. The Mahomedan is the most zealous and furious iconoclast in the world; he outruns Jew and Protestant in his hatred of idols. MAIO3RT did not much care about his deity being just or benevolent, but he would have him a sole and un-embodied deity. That was the onie truth which fed the long meditations in the Cave of Mount Hira, and gave the PILOPHET'S persecuting sword its one excuse. He mnew that so far as be really veiled the DEITY, hid Him from human eyes, divested Him of fictitious form or colour, and removed Him into the bosom of mnystery and the sanctuary of the unseen, that so far he exalted the DEITy. He mixed with this truth a multitude of lies, but thirs truth Mahomedanism does embody and defend. Brahminism, on the other hand, is the most impudent and outrageous system of idolatry in the world. There is no religion that has so outraged decency in its audacious representations of the infinite unseen Being, that has dragged Him so uncerermoniously to the very surface of the world of sense, and clothed Hiim in such outlandish, gross, aud fanciful shapes. Brahmninism riots and luxuriater. in the representation of Deity. Here, then, are two religions which rise upon totally opposite principles, one on the idea of representing the Deity, the other on the idea of abstaining from all representation, as being impioIIs and blasphemous,; the one the grossest of idolatries, the other the fiercest of protests against idolatry. Yet these two religions now combine inone religious appeal to the native population of India. The Manifesto is addressed to " all Hindoos and " Mussulmans," and urges them to a common and mutual defence of their two respective religions against English assault. So here is Hindoo fighting for Mahomedanism, and Mahomedan for Ilindooism ; whereas, on every ground, the Mahomedan ought to censider himself much nearer a Christian than a Hindoo in creed. It is, indeed, a simple fact that he so considers himself. HIe adcepts the Old Testament, honours the Jewish Patriarchs and Prophets, and gives Oun LoaD HEimself the very first place as a Messenger from Heaven1 -c t that of his own Paor=T. A Mahomedan, then, accepts to a large extent the premisses of Christianity. But here he embarks in a joint anti-Christian crusade with the Hindoo, whom he must regard as having much less in common with him than the Christian. Such a union is a mockery. Christianity is probably a more formidable power to each of them than either is to the other, and therefore fear of a common enemy may sustain the compact for a time, but the failure or the success of this rebellion must either of them alike dissolve it. But how are we to meet this document practically? What effect should it be allowed to have upon our religious relations to India ? We answer, none whatever of an intimidating kind. This whole Mutiny is doubtless a call on us to review our religious policy and tactics in India,-to examine what we have done either way, either in the way of concession to Hindoo religion or of opposition or discourag,ement to it. But let us do this without aDy deference to such unfounded and ridiculous religious fears as are, or are pretended to be, represented by this Manifesto. There can be no doubt that, as a Govermsnent, we are prohibited by compact from proselytizing in India. Let that compact be observed as heretofore. And we must rem-trk that such a compact includes the subordinates as well as the heads of the Indian Government, civil and military. We must have no missionary Colonels. Such proselytizing efforts as those of Colonel WHx.RR are wholly indefensible; indeed, a writer in our columns to-day, in his defence, himself gives them up, informing us that there is a written, express, standing regulation against military proselytizing, and only excusing Colonel WHzi~EiE on the ground of this regulation having. been allowed at head-quarters practically to sleep, so that, in the absence of any notice from his superiors, the Colonel was not properly aware of the fact that he was transgressitig, and took silence for consent. We are glad to hear, too, from the same writer that the feeling of even religious officers in India is against officers proselytizing. It appears to be felt that such a work, however good in itself, and highly suitable to men under no engagements that conflict with it, is not in accordance with the position of a military officer, who, as the instrument of a Government bound by compact not to propagandizm, is himself under the same veto. But Government propagandism is one thing,aud natuial Christian influence is another. It is not to be supposed, because we are prohibited from converting Hindoos by the sword, that therefore private Christians may not maintain missionaries, establish funds, and found institutions. It would also be a most gratuitous interference with the liberty of the individual to say that civil and military officers, and even Governors-General, may not in their private caDacity, and as simple members of society, subscribe to such institutions. If Lord CAiNNIN, then, has subscribed to the Calcutta Bible Society, to the College at Serampore, and to the Scotch Free Church School, though the two latter are not strictly religious institutions at all, he has transgressed no rule. Former Governors-General have done just the same. Lord WE:LLSLBY, Lord MrnTo, Lord EHASTiNGS, Sir C. METCASFE, Lord WIILIAM BmiTiNex, all aided such schemes. The very Brahmins themselves, as " AN Oi LNDIAN ' tells us, laugh at Lord ELLuBOROUH for attaching such tremendous consequences to acts like these, and connecting this mutiny with them ;-" Did you ever hear such nonsense ' being the comment of an old member of this order made to our correspondent. Nor is there anything to prevent a Government even as such engaging in plans of general benevolence, and founding or adopting institutions which are simply meant to improve the secular condition, mental or bodily, of the Hindoo. We must draw the proper distinctions on thia subject, and the proper distinctions seem to be between religious improvement and secular, and between publhc capacity and private. An institution which has for its avowed object the conversion of the Hindoo ought not to be a Government institution, but there is no reason why a mere school of secular teaching should not. After all, it will not do to give in too much to the native prejudices. A few official proselytizers like Colonel WanZEt may have done hami, but our concessions to native prejudices have done harm too. We have given in too much to the pride of caste, too much even for policy. The Sepoy, so far from thanking us, has simply accepted our concession as the reluctant homage of fear, and has risen in his own conceit of himself proportionally. In one sense we cannot help proselytizing in India; the very presence of the Christian religion in that country is a missionary appeal. You cannot help the effect of the sight of European power, greatness, wisdom, and justice -the sight of a Christian Power armed with these attributes upon the minds of sagacious and rational natives. We cannot divest ourselves of our character as a Christian nation, and annul the fact that we are a Christian population in India. We cannot call upon the Indian Government wholly to abandon all schemes for improving and elevating the native Rindoo, enlarging his mind and acquainting him with Etiuropean literature and history, simply because such advance in knowledge may indirectly have the effect of making him discontented with his old absurd religion and introducing him to the evidences and the moral fruits of another. Stich indirect propagandism as this, if it excites the spleen of the Bindoo, must continue to excite it. We are bound by our compact not to interfere by force wvith his religion, but are also bound by our duty as rulers of India to advance the moral and intellectual welfare of the people under our rule.
Lord ELGm is rather in the position of Baron MUNC1AUSEN, when, on turning round, the Baron found the hind quarters of his horse gone, and that he was riding on the front half only, the niolent slam of a malignant gate having cut the animal in two in the middle. The Ambassador to China looks back and sees bis army-the train and long array which should have backed him up-the hind quarters of the Plenipotentiary-vanished, Re has only possession of the horse's head-the front, or diplomatic balf, the official mission, ceremonial state, and dignity of the Ambassador. The Indian Mutiny is the gate which has slammed violentlyupon bis Lordship's chargerW and cut it in two. Under these circumstances what must the Plenipotentiary to China do ? Doubtless there are not wanting at Hongkong those who would sitil urge an irnmediate attack upon Canton, in spite of the small force to which the Indian necessity has reduced us there. Canton is called a city, but it is only a city in the Chinese acceptation of the word. The Chinese have no cities in the European sense. What they call such are large collections of low habitations, about the height and general appearance of our lodges, outhouses, and greenhouses, spread out diffusely over a large space of country. A Chinete city contains numbers of enclosures sufficiently large, as our correspondent says, to be called parks-the residences of the chief officials and richer merchants. A city there, in short, means rather a populous disrict than either theowlled,and fenced, and moated mass of aspirant gables thai compowes t continental city, or even than tha continuous succession of streets, rows, and alloys, which makes an English town. Such a kind of city offers, of course, no great strategic opportunities of defence, and, Canton having been once taken by a force of 2,600 men under Lord Goui. mig,ht be taken again by the srma force, in which case we sho-ald be abundantly strong enough even now to take the place, our fighting men there being more than 5,000viz., 4,000 sailors, 500 Marines, and 800 healthy soldiers. But it is of no use taking unless you have strength to keep, and, though military men can be found who say that 500 men, relieved once a fortnight, ought to hold Canton for six months, Lord GOUGE'S dashing occupation of the city was rather a warning against such attempts for the future than an encouragement of them. In the void interval, then,which the abstraction of the Plenipotentiary's forces leaves there is, perhaps, nothing better for Lord ELoIu to do than to pay a visit to the Chinese Esxrznot, which is the step on which he determined. At least, he will sail to the mouth of the Pei-ho, the river on which the Imperial city stands. What wil come of this visit nobody can tell,-probably not much. A great deal of time will be wasted in introductory ceremonial, silky compliments, pompous speeches, and crossings to and fro of Mandarins and Court officers, and at last the Ambassador wiU very likely be dismissed with an oracular response which will mean nothing. But therewill be, atanyrate,thus much gained,-that the attention of the Chinese Court will have been challenged expressly to the point of dispute, so that the dilemma wiU be necessary either that the Court will corme to terms, in which case we shall have a satisfactory conclusion of the whole affair without any fighting, or that it will refuse to come to terms, in which case we shall have additional strength and clearness given to our line as belligerents. The Plenipotentiary's journey to the north will doubtlems disappoint a considerable class of Hongkong residents. These persons very naturaUy, after some years' experience, arrive at the opinion that it is not of the slightest use talking to the Chinese, that they do not understand diplomatic discussion in the European sense,i. c., that they have no idea of two parties fairly comparing their two points of view together, stating their respective rights, and cominig to an issue upon thie merits of the case. They will say that the Chinese, like Asiatics in general, regard words only as pieces of ceremonial and state, ornamfntal covers and disguises for resolutions already made up, and not at all as vehicles of truth, explanation, and adjustment. They will say that the only argument which they really understand is that of force; and probably in this they will say what is to a considerable extent true. At the same time, there are other considerations to be taken into account. Besides what has been already said for the necessity of delay, we must remember that other countries besides ourselves trade with China, and that their intUrests are involved in a war between China and this country. A war is a generaUy unsettling thing, and touches others besides the parties actuaUy engaged in it. We are not the only nation that drinks tea. The Aimerisans and Portuguese are sufficiently discontented even with our blocWade of Canton, and therefore, if we have to proceed to extremities, it is as well that we should do so after every reasonable attempt to supersede the necessity of doing so. Let us go to war, if we are to go to war, in an orthodox way, rather than assume the right to chastise the province of a foreign empire, as if our relations were with an isolated province, and not the whole empire. It must be remembered that a state of hostilities like the present with China is by no means an easy, clear, and plain-sailing affair. The international difficulties which arise are endless. We take indisputable war junks, and find they are claimed by Americans. Our naval officers have the most perplexing task, and are in perpetual danger of getting into scrapes from simply not knowing who is who, who may be boarded and who must be respected. The Queen of EN.GL&n,D, againt ought not to make war upon YEn. That is' quite certain. Thne only antagonist upon whom she can send an army with dignity is the Emperor of CniNA himself. It is necessary, then, that the point of the personality of our antagonist should be cleared up, and that England should not ron the risk of appearing to be carrying on a war with Commissioner Yxn. Lord ELG's journey to the mouth of the Pei-ho will not, under such circumstances, appear an unnecessary waste of time, a superfluous concession to Chinese pride, or au undue tribute to the mercantile interests of other coUntries. What, indeed, is there for him to do if he stays at Hongkong? Nothing. He cannot enter into diplomatic communications with YEH. That would be absurd indeed. He cannot proceed to attack Canton, because he has not got his army yet. Then necessity and policy alike suggest, even as a mode of whiling away the time, were there no other reason, a journey to the north. It is doubtless not a pleasant thing for a Plenipotentiary to be deprived in the crisis of his mission of his great argument. It would be much more etfective and convenient could Lord ELGIN point to his men, instead of assuring the Chinese Government that they are coming. The appeal to the eye would be more forcible, more summary, and more intelligible. But Lord ELF IN is not the first Ambassador who has been left for a short time in the lurch. Events thwart our best designs and cross our most certain exi ee ations. England is now like a person full of coafficting engagements, who can only attend to on] person by putting off another; but she has t'ie head and the resources to attend to all sooner or later, and so Lord ELGIN will have his turn.

COLONEL WHRLBR, OF THE 34th AATIVB INFANTRBY. TO THE BDITORt OF TEE TIMBS. Sir,-The well-known impartiality of ThC 7' -'tCs insures a fair hearing for any one whoso acts in a pablio capacity may have beoome the subject of its criticism. 1 feel suro, tberefore, that you will admit for the dispassionate consideration of your renders a few suggestions from the fziends of Colonel Wheler, of the 34th Native Infantry, whese conduct is animsdverted on in a late number of your jornaxL It is an instinctive impulse with us all to deal with the weaker as the stronger deal with us. Oar Indian aliamities bave given rise to a spirited round game of crimination, in which the Rome Government, the Board of Control, the East India Company's Directors, the Governor-General, the Council, receive and send on the shuttlecock of culpabUity, wbich thenco bounds off to commanders-in-chief, brigadiers, colones, until at length the unenviedl offering floors some unfortunate subordinate, who defends himsef obviously at a disadvantage Against officil omnipotence. But while thus, with perfect ex port faoo sagacity, each party hunts another into tho slough of responsibility, even as in nature, TorTa leaa lurum eeeultur-lnpa lpme espeflam let us ask,-Is tbere a necessty for any scapegoat ? Is it fair, or can it be usefnl in the7prosent crisis to acumilate on isolated individuals, high or low, or on any siDgle set of functionaries, present or past, aU the discredit of an unsound system, the growth of many Governments and of many years? The friends of Colonel Wheler feel that he is unfortunate above others, rather than specially culpablo. When the clond no bigger than a man's hand which had long hung over his regimnent became the commencement of this present storm this officer was the first who had to face it. This circumstance alone sn ely -a&Us for great allowances; uct, as his conduct has given rise to two distinct charges, I would offer a few words on each. The first charge is that he has " preached to the Sepoys." Thereis in truth, a Government order against this; and, sup; osing Colonel Wheler to have systematically infringed it, his practicoe must have been sufficiently notorious. Why, ther, was it never brought under official cogni,ance ? Why, urless because it was not thought worth noticing, and could not therefore have been working all the harm imputed to it ? Now, however, the real offenders against the " rellgious prejudlces of the nativee"-they of the greased cart. ridges-divert responsibility from themselvesin proportion as they can bring it to beat upon " fanatical officers." I am Dot defending the disregard of oven a dormant public order, especially one so obviously necessaty; but surely an officer wbo was really thereby working wholesale mischief in his regiment would have been long ago ordered to desist; and surely those who never thought of denouncing him unttil tl ey had done worse themselves, in violation of religious prejudices, are now rather too hard upon one, perhaps, injudicious, but injudicious in common -with thomselvea " Come out for your religion" was certainly the cry of the 34th mutineer; but the reason ho gave was, "1 You will have to bite the cartridges." On the general question of missionary colonels few of any degree of strictness wUl dissent from your own late remarks, and I long ago heard religioas officers-of whom I may justly specify Brigadier C. Mackenzie, the victim of the Bolarum mutiny-explain that no Indian officer can with propriety attempt this work among his native soldiery, first, because he is in covenant with his emploaers not to do so; and, farther, because of the danger of making mere hypocrites when the religious teacher is also the military superior. And here one fact may answert hose who (setting aside "fanaticism") seem, urlike yourself, to deny that a religlous mancan beauefficientofficer. The4thSikhRegiment was raised and disciplined in 1847 by the same Colin Mackenzie, selected by Lord Hardinge, and only removed from its command in 1849, by Lord Dalhousie, as considering that his " gallantry, ability, and enduranco entitled him to a higher reward." According to some this regiment ought to have turned out good for nothing; but it has, even since ita organization, equalled our own best regiments in conspicuous gallantry; and beyond this its fidelity makes it now even more conspicuous by the side of our own little handful before the walls of DelhL It is held up in your fame-conferring columns by an eye-witness of its exploits as "a regiment never to be forgotten hy Eingland I' and it is now commanded by Captain Octavias Edward Rothney, its original adjutant and, equaDy with his old commanding officer, a real Christian, though no more than he a fanatic. Tho ascounts of this very day's mail are in perfect keeping with the rest. There are many who now think-but that is a separate question-that it will be impossible for us, as rulers of reorganized India, to " respect' henceforth All that is treacherous and diabolical, because, among heterogeneous millions of idolators, It is amblguously called religion; and they begin to doubt whether that primitive off-handed policy was not the wisest-as certainly, where applicable, it bad the highest sanction-which finished off a con luest of idolators by " destroying their altars, breaking down their images," &c.; but then they did not enlist whole rAgiments of the enemy's priests. Stil it is undeniable that so long as our Government chooses to make such covenants they must be faithfally observed by aU subordinates even though made with the House of Rimmon. But, secondly, as to Colonel Wheler. He is cansured also for want of soldierly decision on the first symptoms of mutinj in his regiment. Here again his friends crave for him the benefit of extenuating considerations It has now become much easier thbn it was then for an cfficer to decidehow to deal with mutiners. Any GovernorGeneral would now agree with all the people of England on the value of such men as Iawrence, Hugh Wheeler, Neil, who is still spared to us, and many others, who seem made to shed lustre on, and to receive it from emergencies. But how was it when mutiny was young ? And what were the precedents which Colonel Wheler had to encourage him in March, 1857 W Vhy, candour must admit that he had a very diso uraging precedent in Bolarm. There a very distinguished officer was nearly mnnrdered,-received 11 wounds,-in the fearless performance of a similar duty, and was afterwards told from head-quarters to thank for it only his own intemperate rashness, while the mutineers, though stigmatized in words az they deserved, were with perilous inconsistency left tnpunished. I would suggest nothing disrespectful of the distinguished promulgator of the general order which records this circumstanoe. It may fairly be raid that mutiny was then young to him also; and lenity to Ihe offenders being one horn of his dilemma involved when hishopes and humanityseleoteditmortification and rebuke to the commanding officer. But I urge it simply in Colonel Wheler's vindication that the general order in consonance with the above decision was read to every regiment in India, and many commanding offlicers then felt what one of them tbus expressed, that while they were Bure'to see other mutinies tbey could only do their duty as " with a rope round their necks." This misgiving happily now exists no more; but it was a well-founded one when the 34th Native Infantry broke out, and its oolonel is entitled to hbave it urged in his defence; nor less so although General Hearsey, a higher power, dared to act differently when he arrived. Let, then, Colonel Wheler be allowed, before he be irretrievably condemned, a fresh trial of his soldierly qualifications under the present altered circumstanoes. I am sure that his being a Christian soldier will not endanger the remlt. With many apologies for the length of this, I am, Sir, yours most obediently. AUDI A.,TERAM PARMLi

SECOND EDITION. THB TIMES- OFFICE, Wednesday Moirg. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correFpondeut, dated yesterday (Tuesday), 6 p.m.:_ Various reports have been cumxont here xw ithin the last few days respecting Persia and the effect that recent events in India may have upon the re. lations between that country and England. The delay in the evacuation of Herat has bcen dwelt upon as an indication that Persia was inclined to break the treaty so lately concluded. It Is well known that reliance cannot be invariably placed on the good faith of Persian Governments, but more may be expected from their fears. The question may, perhaps, be reduced to this,-What is'the view the Shah and his advisers take of the Indian insurrection? If they believe that it will for a long time afford such occupation to the arms of England as to prevent her from turning them in other directions, it cannot be considered inmprobable that they may seek to evade, if they do not operly violate, the, as yet, only partially executed treaty. The secret instigations of Russia will, doubtless, not be wanting to urge them to this course-di3honourable, but in accordance with the proverbially perfidious character and traditions of the Persians. We have not yet rcceived information sufficiently positive or recent to enable us to foim a judgment as to what Persia may do, but a certain number of straws have been afforded us-scraps of information, letters in foreign journals, &c.-sufficient to show from what quarter it is thought probable the wind may blow. Among other things, we hear of a violent diplomatic contest between Mr. Murray and the Russian Minister at Teheran. It is well known with what displeasure the Russians view that clause of the treaty which stipulates for.England. and France the saise conditions as are enjoyed by the most f voured nation with respect to consular establish- ments. This clause has not yet been carried out, I and, doubtless, the Russian representative inTeheran has instructions to do all in his power to prevent its execution. A ready way of doing this would be to persuade Persia to break the treaty. This would at any rate adjourn what Russia wishes to prevent, and it would give fresh trouble to England, already busy with India, As regards the non-evacuation of Herat we have various versions. According to one, it is not the Persian Government, but Murad Mirza, Prince of the blood and General-in-Chief, who refuses to give up the place. Here again we may trace the hand of Russia. It is perfectly well known that it was by the aid of Rus3ian officers tbat Herat was taken ; one of these at least is still by the side of the Persian General. According to the Paris Pays, wl'lch rather confide. 1iu the Shah, Murad Mlirza has not refusc d to give up Herat, but has merely repre-ented that the Affghan chief to whom it is to be hauded over is not in a position to receive it. To rece ire here, perhaps, means to hcold; foz it has been aflirmed that, if the fortress were left in the hands of the chief in question, it would assuredly be wrested from bhm by othera, more poxverful than himself, and hostile both to Persia and to England. The DcThats of to-day urges the er turprisuyg and audaciouis character of Murad Alirza as a reason for believing that he has an bitious motives for retaining the place, to which he may feel encouraged by the present condition of India, aud adids that, if the Persian Government proves powerless to overcome his obstinacy, a new conflict betwcan England and Persia is to be feared as soon as India is pacified. According to a correspondence in the Oestrreiejhiscihe Zcitung, the news of the events in India had caused £uch1 a fermentation in Teheran that the members of the English Legation would very probably have to fear, if they appeared in public, the fate of those Russian diplomatists who, some 20 years ago, wero murdered by the populace, which a disadvantageous treaty had exasperated. This is most probably an exaggeration ; but it is quito conceivable that, if the late treaty has caused a feeling of humiliation in Persia, the people may now testify their anger, believing, as they perhaps do, that, had it been deferred a few months, England's Indian embarrassments wouild have prevented her from resorting to arms and obtaiuing the triumphs that compelled its conclutsion. In a question of this kind, and under the pecnliar circilmstances of the case, it is proper to t lke into ca'culation Oriental duplicity, and the delusions that may possibly exist in Persia as to the real extent to which the Indian insurrection incapacitates Great Britain from vindicating her rights elsewhere. On the other hand, there are as yet no s)lid grounds-scarcely anything beyond reports and sulppositions-for believing that Peraia w;Pl not faithfuilly carny osit the treaty. On the contrary, Feruk I han declares his intention of remaining in Frarce until next spring, which implies until the complete execution of the treaty of peace. By the last mail, instructions were forwardec to the French Minister at Teheran to use all his influence with the Sbalh for the prompt carnying out of its condtions, and te insist patticularly on the iniinediate evacuation of Horat, which nothing ought now to prevent. WVe are also itiformed that the Affghan chief to whom the place is to be given. up had made his arrangements for its efficient occupation, and that on the 20th of July peremptory orders on the subject of evacuation hadl been sent to Prinee Murad. If tbis last statem mit be cos rect, in an month or little more we ouglst to learn that the fortress has again changed hands. To-day's Pctps says thst General Jacob himself is of opilion that this could not have been safely clone sooner. I am informed that, at the conference held at Iongkong in the beginning of July last, at which Lord Elgin, Admiral Soymour, and General Ashburnham were present, Admiral Guierin, who, pending the arrival of Admiral Rigault de Genouilly, commands the French fleet iu the Chinese Seas, announced officially that he had received instiuctions from Paris to act in conceis iwith the Euglieh commanders. The elections in Moldavia are to take place a fortnight after the new electoral lists shall have been submitted to the representatives of the Powers. The difficulty at Constantinople completely surmounted, the threatened quarrel between Sardiuia and Naples averted, and in the absence of any topic of interest in European politics, the French papers devote a large portion of their space to our Indian affairs. It is for the interest of France. as of all comniercial countries, that the insurrection should be speedily supprc-nic I, and trauquillity restored. It is in this sen e, and il a very friendly spirit, that the great majority of these journe's express themselves. Some of them, al-rmed by the denunciations of vengeance they have lately seen in English papers, plead, although timidly, the cause of clemency, Thus, to-day, the Dgbats says:- " Reflection will follow anger, exasperation, and thirsb of vengeance. Humanity, lelmency, and generosity will regain the uppor,hand,'and Iultimately triumph. Oar esteem for England and our knowledge of the country convince us that she vwll not apply the law of retaliation to her revolted subjects in India." The C(onstitutiuinel concludes a tummary of Indian intelLigence with the following passage:- "1 Although the English are in a very diiclt positlon, they have confidence in their energy and resources; and should they be even compelled to re-conquer a great portioa of India, and to re establish their authority on a fremh basis it is not doubtful that they w;ll rise superior to the ciis'q The events taking pla^e in India are of immense importance in a financial as in a politcal poeint of view, and we esily conceive the impatienceO ith which all the commercial oltie; of Europe await inotelligence from Calcutta and Bombay Not only the interests of lHnZland but also those of EUrops, are at stake 'ce ore the walls of Delbe " I The LulUetin des Lois publishes a decree promul. gating the treaty for marking out the frontiers be. tween France and Spain, concluded on the 2d of December last. It also contains a decree announc. ing the reception, under the ordinaiy reseives, of the brief given at Rome, on the 3slat of March listI by Pope Pius IX., and author;zig, at the rcquest of the Emperor, the canonical institution of his grand almonuy. The brief is published in Latin and in French, after the decree, and occupies not less than seven pages. Marshal Randon has arrived in France. Jules Favre, the advocate of the Aga Bel-Hadj, has reached Paris, accompanied by the Aga's son, to try to obtain a comn utation of the sentence of 20 years' hard labour. Captain Doinean at first refused to appeal to the superior coin 1. Re was in a state of great exasperation. His brother at last prevailel on him to sign the necesai y paper. The Gazette des Tribunastx says that he heard his sentence to death with perfect caJmness, but that when the President of the Court declared him dishonoured, and degraded from the dignity of member of the Legion of Honour, he manifested emotion. He returned to his prison with a firm step. If his punishment be not commuted, he will be executed on the public square of Oran. In consequence of what has transpired on this trial, the Emperor has issued an order prohibiting summary executions in Algeria. A similar order was given iu Louis Philippe's time, but has not been very strictly ob^erved. IThe Tribunal of Commerce of the Seiue, adopting the view that the younger Thurneyssen has not been proved ever to have held, in the house of Thurneyssen, any other position but that of a clerk having an interest in the profits, and that no portiorn of the capital had ever been assigned to him so as to confer on him the right and title of a part ner, has exonerated him from the liability to which his father has been condemned. Wlle have to remark several cases of sudden death, in the streets of Paris, witbin the last few days. M. Barre, a commercial agent living in the Rue St. Blonorn, was walking on the Boulevard de. Italiens last Saturday, when he was seen to stagger and to fall backwards. The persons near hima hastened to lMt him up, and to fetch a physician, but the latter ascertained that M. Barre was dead, and that he had d;ed of an attack of apoplexy. The dead body was conveyed to his lodgings. M. Deat, living in the Rue des Martyrs, was likewise struck with an attack of apoplexy yesterday on leaving home at a few steps from his house. As he was faling ho was received in the ai.rs of the National Guards, his conr-ades, who were prep:riun. to mounit guard. A doctor was immediately sent for, who tr':d to bleed him, but he could only get a few drops of blood. M. Dejat expired shortly afterwards.

Relliable advIces have been received from Tiflis, the Russian eeat of Government in the Caucasus, that Schamyl stUll holds 11 out of tho 12 blockhouses whien he took from the Russians at the beginniing of the month of June. General Aghalar besieged the blockhouse Ciokalesi for a fortnight, but his troops were attacked one dark night by a strong detachment of mountaineers under the command of the Naib (Lieutenaut or Stadtholder), Hadji Aukar, and co3npletely routed. The Naib took nine guns and 200 prisoners. General Aghalar was severely wounded. Anothier Russian detachment, which had been sent to besiege d'Arli (Darli?), was attacked in the re_r by Daniel Sultan (Schamyl's principal Naib), and defeated. The Tschetschenzes made 400 prisoners. The successes of S^bamyl have created an unpleasant sensation at Tiflis, and 20,000 iroops of the line are about to be sent as a reinforcement to the Russian army of operation. It is said that the G*overnor-General intends to take the command of the next expcdition sgainstSchamyl. There is no Austrian news. ITALY. A telegraphic dcspatch from Turin, dated 31st ult., announces that the King of Sardinia and Prince Napoleon attended on that day the first experiment for cutting through Mount Cenis. The experiment was attended with perfect success. The Venice Gazette states that the annual burden of which the Emperor of Austria has lately exonerated the Pontirical Government for the Austrian gr. risons of Bologna and Ancona amounts to 250,000 scudi (the scudo is bf. 35c.) The Pope visitec7 Volterrr on the 26th ult., in company with the Grand Duke of Tusc.uy. The august personages were received with the usual honours by the magistracy and authorities of the place. The Pope visited the principal estahlishments and convents, and also the alabaster works, for which Volteira Is so c3lebrated. The town was illumiuato-3 during the nit-ht. His Holiuess was stiUl in the town the next day.

The British and North American Royal Mail steam-ship Arabia, hence, had arrived at New York. The New York Herald's coirespondence from Washington states, on authority, "That the Nicaragua Minister had received by the Tennessee advices that Nicaragua does not approve the contract of Costa Rica with Vebster for the transit route, but ignores it." At New York the want of money was so light as to create no trouble among the weaker houses.

THE DANUBIAN P1UNCIPALITIBS. (FBOM OUR OWN C 00 BUCHAXEST, AUG. 22. Everything is still kept in suspense by theAmbas sadors at Constantinople. In spite of Lord Palmerston's declaration in the House of Commons that a satisfactorv arrangement had been made at the late visit of the Emperor of the Frenoch to Osborne, and that there is a hope of Austria's accession to this arrangement, no change has taken place in the Turkis8h cspital, the diplomatic relations of the four Powers with the Porte are stWU suspended, and no orders have been sent to Moldavia to declare the elections annulled, and make arrangements for a new election. Under theze circumstances, one cannot but come to the conclusion that the saiisfactory adjustment was nothing more or less than one of those half measures which flatter with the hope of removing the difficulty, but which in reality are only more apt to complicate matters. The British and Austriai Ambassadors have put themselves prominently, and, if I am not mistaken, more prominentlv, forward than they were justified by the instructions of their respective Governments, in order to dissuade the Turkish Government from acceding to the wishes of the four other Powers; indeed, it is well Xmowa that the Turkish Government was ready to give ia had it not been for the protest of the two Ambassadors, and now the same Ambassadors are charged with impressing the Turkish Government with the necessity of doing the very thing from which they had before dissuaded it. One cannot be surprised that the Turkish Govermment is slow in decidinr itself. The simple reading of the instructions which a-i Ambassador is ordered to communicate makes very little impression unless supported by the whole veight of Ambassadorial authority; how much leas effect will it have if it is known tha' the Ambassadors do not share the opinions expressed in those instructions ! 1 am the last person to wish that any moral pressure should be applied to the Turkish Govern menut to take the view of the allies on this or any other matter, but Europe has a right to expect that things shoeild not be left in this state, and that tue Turkish Government.should come to a decision one way or another. The question to be decided is, inieed, one of internal policy, concerning as it does one of the provinces of the Turkish Empire; but it is, a't the same time, one of European interest,-the corollary of a treaty concluded with other Powers, who as contracting parties have a right to superintend the execution of the dispositions made in it. Five, or, according to Lord Palmerston's declaration about Austria, we might almost say six-that is, all the other Powers except Turkey-have come to the conclusion that irregularities have occurred in carrying out the treaty; auch unanimity surely ought to carry weight with it. The Turks oppose the union. They think iv fatal to their interests. They ought to have shown resolution in opposing the beginning of the discussion of this question, and they ought to have insisted that it should be decided long before it came to such a point. By wanting to keep an untenable position, and by defending what can scarcely be defended, they spoil their case instead of improving it. Frankness and determination in the beginning were all that was required. Instead of taking refuge bebind paltry excuses, such as that the Principalities do not wish the union themselves, they ought tohave said that they could not admit it, and all this trouble woould have been spared to themselves and to others. Honesty would have been here, as everywhere else, the best policy. The suspense in which things are kept is more fatal than any mistake which could have been committed. It does more to discourage those who stiU have faith in the European Powers than anything else which could have been devised; they begin to despair of ever seeing anything good coming out of this collective interference. The impression is gaining ground more and more that the fate of the Principalities is only a ball in the hands of the Powers, wbo, careless about their fature prosperity, consider them only a new field for their po'atical rivalries. The arms of the Allied Powers have freed the Danubian Provinces from the Russian protectorate, and their diplomacy drives them back again more confident than ever. We raised a great outcry about Bolgrad, because the question involved the total expulsion of Russia from the Danube, and now we play into her hands, to get back for her the Danube through the sympathies we raise for her in the Principalities I The discouragement and doubt are such that many people do not believe even in the Divans, and are quite Icareless aboat the elections. The Powers ought to remember that hopes such as they have raised in the Principalities are not so soon forgotten, and that an agitation will not subside so easily as it has been excited; it must have some satisfaction. If they cannot get it from the Western Powers they will try to get it at the firnt favourable opportunity through Russia.
BAm WAY AND MLYINGN SRARBS. Tuesday Evening. The railway-market continues firm, and in many of the leading descriptions an advance has taken place. There is no surplus stock held of any amount, while at present prices the public are disposed rather to effect puirchases than sales. Great Western has improved, being bought for investment; Stour Valley, however, receded 11. A reduction occurred in East Indian. French shares were generaUy lower, and Dutchb Rhenish and Great Luxembourg were a shade better. American descriptions were heavy. In mines there was an advance in East Bassett, North Wheal Crofty, Porhellis, and Wheal Edward; North Wheal Bassett declined. An improvement took place in 0 Ltoman Bank. In miscellaneous securities, Crystal Palace Preference and Mexican and South American receded, and Electric Telegraph closed 11. higher. The shares of the new Red Sea Telegraph Company were nominally quoted this morning par to i premium.

A!ONY-AAKBTdITYI)NTELLIGBOB. Tlesday Evenlng, The funds, opened this morning at the cloeinv prices of yes'cerday, and subsequently oxperienced an advance of more than a quarter per cent., which v;as well maintained. The firt transactions in Consols for money were at 90i, and they left off at 90i to J. For the 14th of October the last price was 91i to J. During the day it transpired tha' the India Company have made a requisition f.r about G,000 additional troops, which, it is calculated, after allowing for contingencies, will raise the total European force in India to 80,000 men IEhe Lumber sent out will also bave exceeded by a few thousand men the aid specified by the Governor-General to be, in his opinion, requisite. The transfer books of Bank Stock, Reduced, and Long Annuities closed to-day for the dividends. Tne final transactions in Bank Stock were at 215 to 217; and in Reduced at 91* to g. New Three per Cents. were quoted 91i to #; India Stock, 210 to 213; India Bonds, 20s. to 16s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. Morey in the Stock-Exchange was in good supply at 4 pir cent. In the discount-market the demand contin-iea active at the Bank minimum. The foreign stock-market has been dull, but prices continue to be fairly supported. Turkish again advanced. Equador New Consolidated were negotiated at 13*; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 79i and 80C; Portuguese, 45l; ditto, for the account, 45S; Russian Four-and-a-RaMf per Cents., 98*; Spanisb, for the account, 40*; ditto, Certificates, G0*; and Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 95i and i. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was no alteration of importance from the rates of last post. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 80c. for money and 66f. 90c. for the present account, showing, in the former caEe, a decline of an eighth. The letters from Paris mention that M. Auguste Thurneyssen, the well-known banker, end one of the directors of the Cr6dit Mobilier, has been de. clared by the TribuDal of Commerce liable for the debts of his nephew, M. Charles T'hurneyssen, who failed for more than 600,0001. and abeconded in May last. The judgment produced an unfavourable effect on the price of Credit Mobilier shares. The 123,0(101. in gold announced last week by the Indomitable, from Australia, reached London this afternoon. A portion will, perhaps, be sold to the Bank. Between conflicting schemes there seems a probability that the Indian telegraph, which ought to be completed in eix months, will either fail altogether, or be delayed until the greatest need for it is passed. For some time two routes have been before the public-one rid the Persian Gulf and the Euphrates to the Mediterranean; the other ri4 the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. After mature deliberation the Government selected the Euphrates line, and granted it a subsidy of 6 per cent.; but a firman was required from Constantinople and apparently the intrigues always rife in that capital against British interests have prevented it from beirg obtained. Meanwhile the promoters of the rival or Red Sea route have thus been stimulated to revive their project, and have appealed to the Governraent and the public to treat the Euphrates line, if not as an impracticability, at all events as a scheme that must be indefinitely deferred. But the Euphrates Company are ready to repel this view, and it is probable that if the arguments of the parties interested on each side were accepted reitber line would be attempted. The objection to the Euphrates line, that there there is a difficulty in ebtaining a firman, cannot hold for a moment. The English Government having already sanctioned it, our influence in the East must have fallen low if Russian or other agents at Constantinople find themselves able to induce the Porte to deny a reeuest for that means of communication 'with our own possessions which, in the interests of civilization, any country under like circumstances might reasonably demand. The question, therefore, if there is to be any rivalry, must realy lie between the comparative merits of the two routes. TheEuphrates cr Tigris plan, according to a modification recently proposed, seems to be for a submarine cable from Kurrachee to Bagdad, along the shallow waters of the Persian Galf, with a land connextion of 1,200 miles from Bagd ad to Constantinople, wvhch would at once bring London and all parts of India into direct direct communication. Within five months, it is computed, the cable from Kurrachee to Bagdad might be laid, whence horsemen would bring meEsages to Constantinople in six days; and meanwhile, the land line beiug in courwe of construction, the distance would be shortened every week. The entire length would be about 2,S(;0 miles, and the eatimated cost 400,0001., and the -whole, it is alleged, could be completed in six or seven months. The only disparagement attempted has been that the land portion would be liable to wanton damage from the Arabs ; lat this idea has met with no countenance from the rersons best acquainted with them, who belicve(, in fact, that they would be its true protectors. If the Americans can venture to carry a line to California through tribes of hostile Indians, the apprehension of gratuiituus mischief in this case must, it is Colltfnded, be regarded as idle, and it is presumed that 'efore sanctioning the scheme Lord Palmerston felt reasonable security en that point. On the other hand, the Red Sea Company contemplate a land line of 240 miles from Alexandria to Suez, ard 4,163 miles of cable from Suez to Aden and Aden to Iurrachee, the estimated cost being 700,0001., and the time required one year. By laying ihe cable in the first instance from Suez to Aden they calculate, however, that at an expense of 300,0001. they could bring India and England within a week's communication in about the same period as that in which a similar result could be effected by the Eiuphrates Company. In this case a principal objection urged is that owing to the tremendous and uncertain depths of the Red Sea and the character of its coral reefs the cable would be lost or almost instantly destroyed. WVhether these predictions are well grouuded may be a question, but they are based on the reasonings of the scientific men most known in connexion with telegraphic enterprise, while the sole testimony cited by the rromoters as to the facility -with which the coral reefs may be avoided is that of a person known only in connexion -with the most reckless engineering delusion ever yet attempted or exposed. Still it is possible, or even probable. that every Lifficulty in the case may be capable ',f being overeome, and it is quite certain that in relation to a question lke that of establishing an Indian teleRraph no fears should be allowed to stand in the way, unless backed by such a unanimous expression of scientific opinion as would amount almost to a demonstration of their correctness. The point to be observed is that there is nothinig as matters at present stand to alter the view originally tal;en by the Home Government, and that if the business is to resolve itself into a contest of routes the battle may be interminable. If the Government have changed their opinion regarding the political advantage of extending our communications on 'he Eupnrates, and are no'w more inclined to favour the various movements in the direction of Suez, tho Euphrates Company will, of course, fail to get their firman, and there the affair will end; but apparently it is only in this way the rivalry can be extinguished. A better course to meet the difficulty seems, however, toprcsent itself. If both lines are practicable both should be completed, and each thouild be encouraged to compete with the other to see how soon the first linkl can be realized. With cn]y one Lne in existence w hst would be our state in Case of emergency? Let any one imagine our position, sUpposing a break to occur at any momentous period, and to plae us in all the helplessness of those who have brought every habit and arrangement to work in reliance upon a means which abruptly and utterly fails them. In time of war vwith the announcement that the Tndian cable had broken we should be lice a crowd in a room with the gas suddenly tuirned off. And what would be our consolation for the panic and for the millions of loss it wrould involve In money, fame, and t9rritery 9 That in the year 18s7, when we were spending about 2,000,0001. per niom,t4i in steam transports, &-e., we had saved a single out)ay of 400,0001 1 The oonsideration seems so iUcredible that it can hardly be dealt with seriously. It is to be remembered, moreover, that in critieil times, if the accident happened or not, we should be in constant agony from its probability. Still, what-
BAL LWAY INZELLIGGE CE. WRNT TTA1rT'T.?l;flr%T The annual meetingof this railway aud dook company was held on Friday at Hartlepool, hI r. R. W. Jaokson in the chair. The roport stated that the revenue for the year 1856 amounted to 1G4,1351., the working exp-n,ee to 78,0841., and taxation to 1,9761., leavin- a surplos of 84,0751. Out of which, after paying interest on loans and other fixed payments chargeable against revenue, a balance remained of 43,64GI. The preference shareholders having been paid, the proprietors of consolidated stuck have received a divi. dend at the rate of 4t per ceant. per annum for the first half, and at the rate of 4A per cent. per snunm for the second half of the Near, leaving 1,2911. The gross revenue for the year 1856 gave an increase of 19,0431., being about 14 par cent. over that of the previous year. The capital account shows that 2,037,1431. had been expended, including ontlay upon works not completed. The improvements in the harbeur had already produced most satisfactory results. Before they were undertaken the width of the entrance to the harbour was 135 feet; it was now 240 feet. The area origisially enclosed was 12 acres, it was now nearly 45 acres. The available depth of water obtained in the harbour was originally between 14 and 15 feet at spring tides, and about 11 feet at neap tides, it was now nearly 20 feet at spring tides and 16 feet at neap tides. Provision was at first only made for vessels up to 300 tons register, buit now they can load ships of upwards of 2.600 tons register. The directors do not contemplate any new woriks. Their exclusive attention would in future be devoted to completing what was now in hand, to the reduction of working expenses, and to making the entire expenditure year by year prodictive by the gradtal developement of the vast resources of the company. The cost of the works connected with the harbour and docks amounted to about 9,0001. per acre, and those of the railway to under 20,0001. per male, everything included. The company have powers to raise capital in sbares and loans to the extent of 2,6S6,0801., of which 2,037,143?. has been expended, leaving a balance of 048,9371. to the credit of capital. The income of the first half of the presentyear has been 78,7101. as compared with 70,4701. for the corresponding sisx months of 1850, being an increase of 8,2431., and the proprietors of consolidated stock may now receive an intermuediate dividend for the last half-year at the rate of 41 per cent. per annuns. The directors hope to see the revenue approach 4,000?. a-week before the close of the current half-year. The revenise for the year 1856 amounted to 164,135?., for 1S55 to 145,092l., and for lb54 to 129,732?., showing a con. siderable increase. On the motion of the CHAIRBfAN resolutions were passed adopting the report and declaring dividends mentioned therein, and also an intermediate dividend at the rate of 4A per cent. per aDnum for the past half-year. payable on the 25th of September ; and re-electis,g the retiring directors and auditors. The proceedings concluded with tbe best thanks of the meeting to the chairman and directors. CORNWALL. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Truro on Saturday ; Mr. W. Williams in the chair. The report stated that an Act had been obtained by the associated companies extending the time for the completion of the works to the 23d of June, 1860, and for the immediate creation and issue of preference shares to the amount of 300,0001., with a furthier power, at the option of the associated companies, to create such further number of shares, not exceeding 100,001. in amount, as may be need. ful for completing the line from Plymouth to Truro. The associated companies had guaranteed 5 per cent. per annum on the 15,000 sbares of 201. each which had been offered to the shareholders; but those not taken up would be offered to other parties. This would enable the directors to complete the work and leave a large amount unissued to complete the line on to Falmouth. The works generally wereprogressing satisfactorily, and would be completed by the time the bridge at Saltash was constructed. During the half-year ending the 3Oth of June 60,995?. had been received, of which 46,3001. had been borrowed from the bankers of the company, and would be repaid out of the moneys now being received on the new shares. The expenditure during the half-year amounted to 66 85S5., leaving the balance on the whole account of 32,3481., of which 25,000?. was in the hands of trustees under the lease to meet the payment of interest on debentures. The CHAIsRMAN, In moving the adoption of the report, said the Saltash bridge was gradually approaching completion, and the works on the line were in a forward state. it was now 10 years since he first occupied the chair at their meetings ; they had been led on from time to tinme in the hope of being able to construct their line, but from all he could aseertain the day was evidently not far distant when their great undertaking would be completed. He fully believed that the calculations they had made of the traffic would fai far short of the actual receipts on the line when opened for traffic. The portion of the line from Truro to Liskeard was completed with the exception of laying the rails and building the stations. From Liskeard to Saltash the line was completed with the exception of three or four bridges. It was expected that no engineering difficulty would arise in fioatin" the tubes of the Saltash bridge to their positions for one-half of the bridge. When these tubes were lifted to the level of the road anid secured in their places the other half of the superstructure would be proceeded with, and probably completed in a few months. They had been hitherto restricted by want of funds, but he thought from the arrangements made for raising 300.0001. that their operations would not be again retarded in that respect. Tbere was every prospect that their funds would be sufficient to complete the line to Falmouth. Resolutions weropassed adopting the report, and confirming the forfeiture of 2,656 shares for non -payment of caUs. A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the proceed. in3gs. SOUTH DEVON AND TAVISTOCK. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Plymouth on Saturday, the Earl of Morley in the chair. The report stated that the works were proceeding verv satisfactorily ; the season had been favourable for such operations, and the directors had done their utmost to expedite the works, and so far as they could see the result had been most satisfactory. The CitAsistmtN, in moving the adoption of the report, said that the faster they could proceed with the works the earlier they would be in a position to lease their line to the South Devon Railway Company, and the sooner they would be able to declare a dividend. The directors thought themselves very fortunate in securing the services of Mr. Brunel as their engineer. He had met them in the most liberal spirit, and they now had secured his services upon nearly the same terms as those given to their former engineer, the late Mr. Bampton. The report was received and adopted; Messrs. W. E. Rendle, W. Hloney, and D. Derry, the retiring directors were re-elected; and Messrs. Henderson and Vosper, the retiring auditors, wore re-elected. The meeting was then made special, and the directors were authorized to apply to Parliament in the next session for an act to authorize the company to grant a lease of their undertaking to the South Devon R?ailway Company, in ac. cordance with the agreement entered into between the two companies. The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors. EXETER AND EXMOUTH. The adjourned special and half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Exmbouth on Saturday. Mr. J. H. Walker presided. The special business was to consider the proposed terms for leasing the line to the South Devon Company (the terms of which have appeared in T/e Times), and upon this business being entered upon Mr. C. WEscomni moved, that the proposed termsof lease with the South Devon Company be not confirmed, which was seconded by Mr. GFORGE Dow,;, and carried unanimously. The adjourned half-yearly business was then proceeded with, when Mr. C. WFScomn said the sbareholders had acted wisely in getting rid of the lease; and, as they had ample money subscribed to make their line as far as Topsham, the directors and sbareholders' conimittee had that day unanimously agreed to recommend the following resolution for adoption by the meeting:- " That the directors be requested to tako Pteps to commence forthwith the railway (except the permanent way) from Exmouth to the east side of the river Ciyet, ate ash pricee, end that it be recommended to have a contract at a total fixed eum, rather than upon an estimate of quiantities, price, Re"~ Mr. G. DowN seconded the motion, and said hb was in a position to offer terms for leasing or working the line on behalf of the South-Western Company, and would, if permitted, submit those terms to the meeting, but it was ultimately resolved that the terms should not be read at the meeting, though it was stated they were much more acceptable than those proposed by the South Devon Company. This resolution was also carried unanimoubly, and after some personal altercation between Mr. Sheppard and his brother directors, Dr. Spettigue and Mr. Pratt retired from the board, upon which The CHAIRMAN said, unless those two gentlemen nltimately withdrew their resignations before the next board meeting, he should also resign. The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to Mlr. Sheppard, to the directors, and also to the ehairman. KENDAL AND WINDERMERE. The adjourned meeting of this company was held on Thursday at Kendal, Mr. Heyworth in the chair. The award of Mr. Rotherham for working the line by the Lancaster and Carlisle Company, after a loug discussion a, to its useaning, was accepted by the nmeeting. The ordinary business was then proceeded with, and a dividend of 2s. Gd. per ordinary share was declared for the half-year ending the 30th of June last. The retiring directors were re-elected. M. F. Parker was elected a director, and Mr. Marshall was re-elected auditor. The meeting then separated. DUBLIN AND DROGHEDA. The half-yearly meeting of this conipany was held on Thursday in Dublin, Mr. J. W. Murland in the chair. The SECRETARY read the report, an abstract of which bas appeared in The Times. The CHAIRtAN, in moving the adoption of the report, Eaid he thought that on the whole the traffic on the line as compared with other lines was satisfactory. The receipts for the past balf.year showed an increase of 1,04-51. as compared with the corresponding half of 1S56; bish as at the latter period there was upwards of 5001. received for the conveyunce of troops more than for the past half-year, the increase in the ordinary traffic on the line must have been about 1,5001. The Postmaster-General had given notice to the company that he required a new arbitration to ascertain the amount to be paid for the conveyance of the mails. Although they had been rnnning the same trains, inpoint of fact there had been a very considerable increase in the size of the bags carried, for the business of the Poet-office was always increasing; and, in addition to their ordinarybusiness, they aiso carried books and small parcels. In tuat way the Post-office was carrying its parcels at rates with which the company could not compete (hear, hee.r), and they were therefore redci,g a portion of the com- pan)-'S legitimate traffio. Of all Governmentdepartments lbe 0Pt-offce was 6neUiathid'derived most benefit from railways, and therefore he thought it would be more con. sistent with the position of a great public department like the Post-office to meet the railway companies on fair and reasonable terms. (Elear, hear.) At al events, it would be the duty of the directors to take care of the company's interests in that matter, and, if possible, prevent unfair d !aling. Resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring the dividend mentioned therein, and authorizing the diree. tors to subscribe towards and hold shares in the Dundalk and Enniskillen Company to a certain amount specified in the Aot of 1857. The meeting then separated. DUBLIN AND WICKLOW. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held in Dutbln on Friday, MEr. Darley in the chair. The Secretary read the report, an abstract of which has ap7iesered in She Times. 1hOeC}IArnIBa, in moving the adoption of the report, congratulated theshareholders on the gradual increase of revenue. There had been an increase on the Kingstown branch of more than 3,0001. as compared with the corresponding half of 1856. The increase in the traffic on tho Wicklow line amounted to 2,3181., which he thoughtwas very satisfactory, particularly as the directors were enabled to declare a dividend of 3s. per share free of income-tax. Resolutions were passed adopting the renort, and declaring a dividend of 3s. per share. The pr~oceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors. MANCHESTER, SHEFFIELD, AND LINCOLNSH SR The working expenses and other outgoings of this company's railways (exclusive of the Manchester, South Junction, and Altrincham, stated below) have amounted in the fortnight, ending August 23 to 10,427L, while the corresponding period of 1856 amounted to 9,0301. The sum of 28,8941., already stated, for the farst three fortnights of the half-year, added to the 10,4271. as above makes a total expended of 39,3211., as against 35,2371. for the corresponding four fortnights of the previous year. The proportion of the South Junction, &o., receipts accruing to this company forthe fortnight ending August 23 amounts to 1,362 as against 8221. for the same period of 18566 and the total for the four fortnights of the half-year ending August 23 to 5,2971., as against 3,3791. for the same periol of 1856. The working expenses amounted to 2,1261., as against 1,6441. for the corresponding four fortnights of the previous year. TRAFIC RETURNS. Mles Par- Mer- Total, Totat Ilallways. open. senugs. chandise.

STATE OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, SZPT. 1. Cotton has gone up fully Id. per lb. since Friday, and the consequence has been a general advance of prices here in both yarn and cloth. The business done in cloths last week had the effect of clearing out stocks very considerably, and we have had less activity this morn. ing- but the market is very firm, and where business has been done sellers have obtained a further advance. For yarns there has been a good demand from almost all quarters. For India L fair business is reported in 40's mule, and for Germany 16's to 30's water-twist have gone off well, the advance in all these kinds of twist being 1,d. to Ad er lb. above this day week. Sbippers to Russia are also buyers of 30' water-twist and 40's mule at an advance of fully Ad. The home trade supply themselves with moderate freedom in most kinds of cops, and these spinnings are Ad. to Ad. dearer. MIessrs. John Slagg and Co. report: The active demand reporttd on Tuesday last Sontinued throughout tho week, and the market has heen pretty weU cleared of stocks cf nearly all kinds of goods, in many instances at a further alvance cn the rices then umrrent. Yeaterday and to-day, owing partly to the highet prices asked, and partly to the unfavourahle accounts from India, there has been less doIng In soods for that quarter, but other re3pect there is no change, and the market closes with an upward tendency." LEEDS, SEPT. 1. Thecloth-hallshavebeen attendedby aboutan average num. ber of buyersthis morning, and the like may be said as to the amount of business done. The tone of the market has been steady, and prices are firm. Purchases have been confined chiefly to the heavier kinds of cloths, and, though no very large lots were bought, a good bulk in the aggregate changed hands, and the market, l things considered, was a goed one for the season. HTUDDERSFIELD, SEPT. 1. The market for cloth and other woollen fabrics to-day has been tolerably active, and was better than on this day week. Several purchases were made of the heavier kinds both for the home and foreign markets. For the latter there was an improved demand. Of the better as well as low goods some fair sales were effected. Wool oontinues firm in price, but it has not advanced this week.
BAILWAY A CCIDENTS. TO THE EDITOR OF T1IE TIMES. Sir,-In The Tinmes of to-day is a letter signed " G G.," mentioning a railway accident which might have been prevented bad there been any proper communication between the guard and driver, and he, naturally supposing that there is no plan in practical use, suggests one. I beg to inform " G. G." and the public that Her Majestv will travel down to Scotland this day (so I learn from The Times of a day or two since) with an effective signal between the guard and driver, adapted by Mr. Sturrock, of the Great Northern, to a principle patented by me, about eight years since. Of course they find it effective, or they would not use it to insure the safety of Her Majesty and suite. It is gratifying to me to feel that in the most remote degree I have contributed to such a result. It would be still an additional gratification tofind that Her Majesty'ssubjects were considered by railway managers to be worth taking equal care of; and that by this means-which Is simple, very cheap, and easily applied-valuable lives had been saved- and as directors and poor shareholders have to pay very heavy'sums for these accidents, it is worth their inquiring into, because money as well as life would be saved and raUway dividends improved. If the next sufferer by a " railway smash" would instruct his counsel to put the question,-" Was there any proper signal between guard and driver 7" and, upon being informed that there was none, appeal to the jury for larger damages in consequence, and get them, as no doubt he wool , then it would be found, I believe, that rallway managers would begin to think that it would be as well for them to protect the lives of passengers, and to adopt some signal between the guards and drivers of trains, and by all means a better one, if they can find it, than that of Your obedient servant.

Between September and October, although the latter is often a beautiful autum. nal month, and was not last year by any means a wet one, the number of visitors at once dropped from 20,742 to 5,179. To that no less attractive resort, New-gardens, tbere were no less than 344,140 visitors last year, of whom 176,952 took the advantage of the holyday of Sunday to visit the gardens, while 167,188 went on other days.

HARVEST FESTIVIrlES 1Df NORFOLK.-The fourth P nnual harvest festival took place at Brooke, near Norwich on Friday last, commencing, as usual, with divine service in the parish church. About 350 persons, the harvestmen, their wives, and children, then sat down to a substantial repast in the Vicarage garden Floral decoratioas of every imaginable form, festoons and arches, crowns and wreaths, garlands and evergreens, entwined with skill and taste by village artists, enhanced the gaiety of the scene, while the visitors who had assembled to assist in the celebration evidently partook of the pleasure which overywhere prevailed. An efficient band of music lent its aid to the cheerfulness of the occasion. After dinner the guests were addressed by Mr. Holmes, the resident proprietor of the parish, and his remarks were received with considerable applause. He placed the park at the disposal of the labourers, either as a promenade or a cricket-ground, observing that every arrangement had been made for them to enjoy their games, and, in conclusion, proposed the health of the vicar of the parish and Mrs. Beal, which was most cordially received. As the afternoon advanced amusements of various kinds were enjoyed with a zest and energy in no degree diminished by the toils of the harvest fLeld, or by the good fare which had been provided. About 8 o'clock all dispersed quietly to their homes, as the echoes of the national anthlam died away througb the glades of the village. " This is the best of the four festivals we have had," was the remark made by many of the guests as' they returned to their cottage homes, delighted and thankful. The main feature of this movement is its parochial and family character. Three years since we noticed its initiation in these columns, and at the close of last harveat 18 such festivals were held in the county of Norfolk,-a number still likely to increase, if simplicity of arrangement and detail be preserved. Thin year the harvestmen of Brooke had their choice given them, whether they would revert to their old customs or wished the parochial sstem recently introduced to be continued, and the parish.festival preceded by thanksgiving service at church was adopted by acclamation. The celebration would thus seem to have assumed features of permanence and stability, which may weU be taken as indicative, not only of an improving social condition, but of the respect and regard entertained for their promoters by the rural population in whose midst they reside. The Brooke festival was inaugurated on Thursday by a cricket match, at which a large number of the labourers attended in the park, and was followed on Saturday by the distribution of the abundant relics of the feast to the widows of the parish. tAdvertisemant.)-lndia. - Stanford's Map of India, based upon tbe ,irves erecuted by order of the UeoL the East India cOomgany, the specid maps of the Surveyor-General, and otber anu tbozl t?e hotsg the latest territorial acquisitions of the 3ritish. the Independent aoD protected States, the railwaye. canals, mitary atations, &o. together with aontinuat'ouot the British Trans-Gangetis provlnes, and diagrams eibisiting distances and bearings from the threeptesidencIes of BenDgal Madras, and Bombay.

THEE HEALTHI OF LONDON. (Prom the Registrar-General's Weekly Return.) The deaths registered in London in the week that endod on Eaturday, August 29, were 1,177; they exhibit an increase on the number of the previous week, which waa 1,09L In the 10 years 1847-f6 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,345, which, if it be raised for comparison with the deaths of last week in proportion to increase of population, will become 1,480. But the average is sweUed beyond ordinary limits by cholera In the epidemic years 1849 and 1854; and if this disturbing element be withdrawn from the calculation it wiu be found that the rate of mortality in last week exceeds, but only to a small extent, the aTerage rate at the end of August. The number of ohUdren born in the week exceeded the number of persons of all ages who died by 479. The total mortality of last week exceeded that of the week which preceded it, as has been stated above; but the increase does not arise from diseases of tho zymotic cbaracter taken in the aggregate, for though typhus (with common fever) was fatal in more cases, the number baving risen from 41 to 66, scarlatina and diarrhoea showed a decrease. The fatal cases of diarrhma in the last three weeks were 244, 215, and 198; those referred to "cholera " in the same periods, 21, 12, and 15. The sub-districts of St. John, Marylebone, and St. Panl, Deptford, returned more deaths last week from diarrhce3 than any other of the metropolitan sub-districts; there were 7 in St. John, and 8 in St. PauL Eight fatal cases of smallpox are recorded, 3 of which occurred in the Smallpox Hospital. Three persons died of intemperance, a child from " destitution," 12 infants from want of breast-milk, 13 women from disease8 incidental to childbearing. Six persons are returned who before they died had attained the age of 91 years or more, of these only one was a man, who died at the age of 95 at Lee ; the rest were widows, at ages varying from 91 to 95, the oldest having died at Deptford. Last week the births of 857 boys and 799 girls, in all 1,656 children, were registered in London. In the ten corresponding 'weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,470. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwfch, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29.943 in. The mean daily reading was above 30 in. on three days. The highest reading was 30-18 in. on Thursday. The mean temperature of the week was 669', which is 7 -I above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisber). The mean temperature was above the average on every day of the week; and on Snunday and Monday the excess was respectively 120 and 13'. The temperature feD as the week advanced. The thermomoter in the shade reached its highest point on Sunday (the 23d), when it was 8559°; the lowest point was 488' on Friday. On Tuesday the thermometer in the sun rose to 106-4°. The thermometrical rango of the week was 37-1'. The mean dew-point temperature was 583', and the difforence between this and the mean temperature of the air, indicating its dryness, was 8 6. The mean temperature of the water of the Thames was 69-1'. The air was calm during great part of the week; at the begenning the wind was in the south-east, at the end in the north-east, No rain was measured by the gauge.
INDIANZ BIAOGAGE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In reading 27te 7lin,s of Friday I was much struck, under the head of " Military and Naval Intelligence," with your remarks on the Immense amount of baggage accom. panying the regiments embarking for India. Having myself made more than one voyage to that country, and been quartered in most of the stations from Calcutta to Peshawur, and campaigned both winter and summer, I tale the liberty of sending you a few hints for the use of officers about to embark. An outfitter will persuade you that it is impossible to leave the country without furniture sufficient to fill a moderate-sized cottage and a kit which would comfortably supply the wants of at least a dozesi persons. Listen not to the voice of the charmer, be has not your interest, but that of his bill, at heart. In nine cases out of ten an officer on his arrival in Calcutta or Bombay has been obltged to leave his heavy baggage in store, where it has rotted and become useless. This in the quietest of times. How mush snore so now, when the carriage allowed to each officer is strictly limited to the regulation allowance-viz., For a subaltern and assistant-surgeon ...1 cameL Captain and surgeon ... ... ... 2 ditto. lMajor ... *. ... .. ... 3 ditto. Colonel ... ... ... ... ... 4 ditto. The following wil be found sufficient baggage, and of the most useful kind, for service in the field in India:- 1. Two camelboxes, each fitted with two rings. 2. A bed frame, with cane bottom, at each corner a hook which fits into the rings of the boxes, and forms a bed ; by this plan the boxes can never be stolen from your tent at night. 3. A large piece of waterproof (that will stand heat) to cover the bed and bedding,-this is mucb better than the waterproof cases supplied by outfitters, which are useless in marching, the bed and bedding being covered and placed fiat on the cameL 4. A good horsehair mattress, pWlow, bolster, blankets, eo., for bed. 5. A large-sized wooden tub for washing, the top making a table. The tub to contain a tin washing basin and tripod for same, a small filter, and a box to hold a few plates, glasses, knives and forks, &o. A regalar canteen is the most useless and expensive article an officer can take out. A native will never replace the things ia use in the canteen, and I have often seen among an officer's baggage a canteen perfectly empty, while the plates, glasses, ho., were carefully packed up in an empty beer box. 6. One or more pairs of good thick-soled wiater walking boots; these are invaluable in India. The boots of the country do ; ery well in dry weather, but with the least wet they are like brown paper. 7. Ilannel jacket and trousers, most comfortable to put on after a long march; also flannel bands. Good flannel is not to be procured in India, and I should recommend every one taking out a spare piece. Other clothes in moderation; and, finally, a really good regulation size sword, and not the miserable spits which it is the fashion for officers to wear now a-days, and which I have often seen nearly out in two by a stroke of a oommon native tulwar. I remain, Sir, your obedient servant. MILES. Paris, Aug. 31.
CNsus oF DELuSi u- 1845-46.-As at the present moment every species of information regarding tbe imperial city is anxiously sought after, no apology may be necessary for troubling our readers with details of so dry a nature as the following :-On taking the census cf 1846 it was ascertained that Delhi contained 25,611 houses, 9,945 shops, mostly one-storied, 261 mnosues, ISS temples, I church, 678 wells, and 196 schools. lhe total population consisted of 137,977 souls, of whom 69,738 were males and 68,239 females. Of these 90 families, or 327 persons. were Christians; 14,768 families, or 66,120 persons, were M ahomedans, and 19,257 familes, or 71,530 persons, were Hindoos. In the year 1846 there were born 1,994 males and 1,910 females. The marriages were 953 innumber, and 4,850 deathsoccurred. Of the last 1,320 took placo before the age of 12 months 493 between 12 months and 2 years, 843 between 2 and 12 years, and 2,194 above that age. The census of the thirteen villages forming the suburbs of Delhi comes down to 1S47, They then contained 22302 inhabitants-namely, of fin. doos, 709 cultivators, 14,906 non-cultivators; and of Mahomedans, 495 cultivators, and 6,192 non-cultivatora In this return there are two points worthy of notice. The first is that, notwithstanding the practice of polygamy, there is a very trifling difference between the namber of males and that of females. The only inference to be drawn from this fact is that a large proportion of the males must be nnartied, and that, consequently, dissolute habits are the rule.

YtOBD.S KR2BYOY, .RLLBVBOROUGH, AND QNTBBDsN.* I continued from The Timts of Aug. 28. Lord Ellenborough was a chief of a very different valibre from Lords Kenyon, and Lord Campbell approaches him 'with a corresponausg change of manner:- " I now come to a Chie( Jusice with whom I have had many a personl conflict, and from whom for several years I experienced very rough treatment, but for whose memory I entertain the highest respect. He was a man of gigant a intellect; he had the advantage of the very best education which England could beetow; be was not only a oansu.- mate master of his own profe.sison, but well inltiated in mathematioal science, and one of the best classical scholar3 of his day; he had great fanlt, but they were consisten' with the qualities essentia71y required to enable him to fill his high office with applause. Ellenborough vwas a real Chief-suoh as the rising generation of lawyers may read of and figure to themselves in imagination, but may never behold to dread or to admire. "When I first entered Westminster-hall In my wig and gOwD, I there found him the ' monrch of all he surveyed,' and, at this distance of timze, I can hardly recollect without aweo his appearance and his mzanner as he ruled over his submissive subDjects. EntlI must nowf trace his progress till he reached this elevatfon." Edward Law. afterwards Lord Ellenborough, was the youngest son of the well-known Dr. Edmund law, Bishop of Carlisle. He was born at Salkeld, in 1750 ; was sent to the Charterhonse, and thence to Cambridge. He had risen to be captain of the school at the Charterhouse, and had there displayed the same vigour of character and the same mixture of arrogance and nteliomie which afterwards distinguished him. He was described by Capel l oft, his class-fellow, who had alternately experienced harshness and kindness from him, as then " abluff, burly boy, at once moody and good-natured, ever ready to inflict a blow or perform an exercise for his schoolfellows." As the blufl boy grew into the man at Peterhouse, Cambridge, he indulged in the dissipation to which the sons of ecclesiastics are not unfrequently prone, and which was then considered compatibe with a vigorousapplicationto study. Lordampbellintinates that he had frequently to clear his head with strong tea, and alliudes to the struggle it cost him to leave an agreeable wine party. But he came out, nevertheless, a third wrangler and first medallist, though even these honours fell short of his and his friends' expectations. After his Bachelor's degree he continued to reside at Cambridge for a couple of years, with a view to a fellowship, spending much of his time upon novels and light literature, even shedding tears, it is said, over Mrs. Sheridan's Sidney Biddudph, and otherwise comporting himself hgiUly in the undetermined status in which so many a would-be lawyer is converted into a reluctant curate. Happily, however, he obtained his fellowship at Trinity, and with it the opportunity of pursuing his legal bent; so on the 10th of June, 1 69, he was entered at Lincoln's-inn. Some pages of his biography at this point may be condensed into the statement that he then worked very hard at his profession. He became a pupil of George Wood, the noted pleader, on whom Lord Mansfield made the professional joke thathis horse "demurred" when it should have "'gone to the country."2 He himself commenced as a special pleader, and obtained several pupils among the Cambridge graduates, and in 1780 he was called to the bar. HIis connexion and reputation gave him an excellent start there, and on the very day of his call he had several retainers given to him by great northern attorneys. Without writing a law book or attending quarter sessions, both which preliminarieshe leaped over disdainfully, he rmushed at once into full practice, causing considerable alarm to those established in business and curiosity among the disinterested. At the opening of the Nisi Prius Court a large pile of briefs lay before him, and he was not liable, therefore, to the frequent indictment in the Circuzit Grand Court for carrying twnam purpuream baggam flacccentem erontino inanitatis casd. He was, in fact, presented with a bag by the Northern leader, Wallace, in consequence of his briefs,-an honour of whichno junior before could boast on his first circuit; and this bag was remarkable for anything but its flaccidity. In short, he made a successful dfbgt upon circuit, though it was not till years afterwards that he was appreciated by the London attorneys. To tell the whole truth, in imitation of the pious candour of his biographer, we must add that the destination of his earliest fees was not very exemplary. For a time he followed the example of the then Lord Chancellor of Great Britain-the ehief distributor, by the way, of ecclesiastidc prefermentwho entertained irregular relations with Mrs. Earvey, of "the Rolliad." But the beautiful and famous Miss Towry intervened to rescue him from the peril of scandsl and the license of his times. Lord Campbell recollects her in the splendour of her matronly state, and can justify the admiration, almost unprecedented, with which she was regarded when, among her many suitors, Law came, saw, and was conquered. The young lady at first resisted a corresponding conquest on her part, but Law wooed robustly, and after a third rebuff succeeded. As Mrs. Law, Miss Towvry retained her beauty, and such admiration did it continue to excite, that she was not only followed at balls and assemblies, but strangers used to collect in BloomBbury-square to gaze at her as she -watered the flowers which stood in her balcony. But no jealousy was excited in the mind of her husband, even when Princes of the blood fluttered around her. For many years the faithful couple lived together in uninterrupted affection and harmony, blessed with a numerous progeny, several of whom united their father's talents with their mother's comeliness. A year or two before their marriage Law was still complaining that his fame was confined to the Northern Circuit, and that he was not employed in a single cause of interest in London, while Erskine was already the foremost man in the King's Bench, and had special retainers all over England. But the greatest opportunity that arn advocate ever obtamed then awaited him in the trial of Warren Rastings, whose cause, for party reasons, Erskine was obliged to decline, whereupon a common friend of Eastings and of Law suggested the latter as qualified by his legal acquirements, eloquence, and intrepidity to do justice to the enormous argument. The resolution was therefore taken to employ him as leading counme], with Plomer and Dallas for his juniors. Law still wore a stuff gown when this retainer was given, but he was clothed in silk before the trial began. He also prepared himself for the task he had undertaken with extraordinary energy, and carrying with him to aretreat at Windermere despatches, examinations, and reports which might have loaded many camels, he spet a long vacation more laborious than the busiest term he had ever known. His preparatory notes have been scanned by Lord Campbell, wvho has seen among them the scraps of paper on which lhe had written, during the autumn, his apostrophes to the Lords respecting the Rohilla war, the cruelties of Debi Sing, and the alleged spoliation of the Begums. ln his first encounter with Fox, Law succeeded in inducing the Peers to compel the prosecutors to produee all their evidence before his client was called upon for his defence. Thin was a great point gained. As the trial went on he succeeded also, to Burke's exasperation, in confining the managers to the ordinary rules of evidence. Hot and fierce was tho econtest between him and Burke, in which, however, the tact of thle experiencet barrister was turned to good account. A Tn example is afforded by his treatment of Michael Angelo Taylor, a frivolous and vain personage, vwho, alhW`ough as a barrister he was the butt of the Northern Circuit, had contrived to get himself appointed as one of the managers. An important point coming on fir argument, Law observed:-" It is really a pity to waste time in discussing such a point, which m.u-t be clear to all lawyers. This is rio point of political expediency, it is a mere point of law ; and my honourable and learned friend there (pointingu to Michael Angelo), from his accurate knowltdge of the law, which he has practised with so miich success, can confirm fully what I say." Michael puffed and swelled and nodded his head, when Burke ran up to him quite furioug, and, shaking him, said, " You little rogue ! what do you mean by assenting to this ?" Law's opening speech for the defence, iu thie Afih eas- of t7he tria, 'was not wanting in solemnity, but it by no means satisfied Miss Burnev, who, like all the Royal household, was a devoted enemy of the impeachment. She imagined that L'AW was frightened. "We (Windham and I) spe:ke of Mr. w, and I e'xpressed some dissatisfaction that such attachers should not have had able aud moro equal opponents. 'But do you not think that Mr. Law spoke well 9' cried Windham-' clear, forcible?' * T:. Lizes of the Chief J"tices of B-gland from the Noirrnwi, Coius 'tlli he chatlkof Lor-d Tealrdc. ByjJebn, ,I,xd QAanpbeil, &" yg' 3. guizray, L9q.4Qn5 18OZ7, 'Not forcible,' cried I-'Iwouldnotsay not clear."' She adds, "In his second 0ration Mr. Lawr as far more animated and less frightened, said acquitted himself so as almost to merit M much commendation as, in my opinion, he had merited ceire!'a the opening." From an autlxentic specimeth, of Law's oratory on this occasion rwe may c6ucjAde,' with Lord Campbell, that he did his- duty in a manly and effective manne?, though it is said Dallas was more polished and Plomer more impressive. MA three advocates considered their defence of Hastings as the most brilliant and creditable part of their career, just as Burke, in comparison with his efforts on the same occasion, undervalued his wrritings against the French Revolution. WVith Burke, also, they itercianged a rankling hostility, wrhich was, however, most unreasonable npon his side. Law had long the credit of making the epigram against him: E Oft have we wondered that on Irish ground "No poisonous reptile has e'er yet been found; "Reveal'd the secret stands of Nature's work, "She saved her venom to produce her Burke." Dallas, however, spontaneously told Lord Campbell it was his, after he had himbelf become Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. Law's fees in this case exceeded 3,0001., but they were a poor pecuniary compensation for his long labours and his great exertions. He was, nevertheless, amply rewarded by his improved position in the profession. Lord Kenyon, indeed, disliked him, and was ever on the watch to put him down, in return for Law's appreciation of his own inapt cuotations and false quantities; but ou the occasion of one of Law's struggles with Erskine the former exhibited his consciousness of this antipathy in the quotation he launched at Erakine,- "Non me taa fervida, terrent "Dicta ferox," and in the emphatic application of its context to the Chief Justice, to v %-, rwith a bow, he added, in a low, solemn tone,- "Di me terrent et Jupiter hostis.' Lord Kenyon, it is eaid, thinking the quotation I must be apologetical or complimentary, bowed again, and summed np impartially. " When it was explained to him his resentment was very bitter, and to his dying day he hated Law; but henceforth he stood in awe of him, and treated him more courteously." The antagonism between Law and Erskine was naturally increased by their political opposition, for at the breaking out of the French Revolution Law joined the very respectable body of alarmist WVhigs who went over to the Government, and he had, in consequence, frequently to conduct the Government prosecutions. The rivals thus encountered in Walker's case, and, after a lively passage of arms, were only reconciled by a profusion of mutual compliments. Law also prosecuted Mr. Redhead Yorke, and on the trial of Lord Thanet and Mr. Fergusson for assisting in the attempt to rescue Arthur O'Connor is said to have gained a triumph over Sheridau, whom he crossexanued somewhat sharply, bat who, according to our notions, could scarcely have answered honestly and at the samne time very differently from what he did. In consequence of Law's conduct on this occasion Lord Campbell says he was hailed as a sincere Tory, and his promotion was thenceforth certain; yet not till he had reached his 51st year, when, in 1801, Addington succeeded Pitt, was he offered the Attorney-Generalship by the new Minister. There was suppose(d to be some professional risk in its acceptance, but Law did not hesitate for "two minutes." He was provided with a seat by the Government, as a matter of course, on his payment of 5001. to the Treasury Borongh Fund, and on kissing hands on receiving knighthood he was congratulated by the King on his previous absence from Parliament in these words: -" For now when you become my AttorneyGeneral, Sir Edward, you wiU not eat your own words, Sir Edward, as so many of your predecessors have been obliged to do, Sir Edward." His maiden speech was delivered in support of the Bill for continuing Martial Law in Ireland. His best speech in the House of Commons was on the Prince of Wales's claim against the King for an account of the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall, which claim he opposed. During the short term of his Attorney-Generalship he had not to conduct any prosecutions fo- treason or political offences, but he did obtain a verdiot in the memorable prosecution of Governor Wall, in consequence of which that unfortunate person, with the assistance of public clamour and through fear of the soldiery, was unmercifully executed. It was about this time that Lord Kenyon's health was failing him, and Lord Campbell happened to be sitting in the students' box in the Court of King's Bench on the 5th of April, 1802, when a note announcing Lord Kenyon s death was put into the AttorneyGeneral's hand. "I am convinced," says Lord Campbell, "that at this time he had receivedno intimation respecting the manner in which the vacancy war to be filled up, for he looked troubled and embarrassed, and immediately withdrew." Nevertheless, he did not again appear in court till the 12th of April, when he was sworn in as Lord Kenyon's successor. Lord Campbell complains that, in consequence of his choosing a sounding title from a small fisbing village on the coast of Cumberland, "' he was forced afterwards to write many millions of large characters beyond what would have been necessary if he had been contented with a word of two syllables, 'Ivithout auy 'Unplhonetic cwzsoncuits." "Denman," of course, occurs as a phonetic model, but the reproach is onlyappropriate in the mouth of the biographer if he enjoyed the privilege of subscribing his own name in pure phoneticals as '' (Jimiei." Lord Ellenborough's appointment was, at all events, popular. It is said his professional qualiications were superior to those of any other man at the bar, and probably they were. He was particularly famous for his mercantile law. He had a thorough knowledge of the rules of evidence, and his diligence, energy, and high character, combined w,ith his strong voice and other physical qualitications, enabled him to gain the ascendancy so requisite in a chief. His deCects were a eartain arrogance of nature, a bad temper, and a leaning to severity of punishment. Moreoxer, he did not introduce any reform in the practice of his court, but worked with the tools he found ready to his hand; nor did he effect any renovation or modification of the principles which ruled the Court of King's Bench, except in repudiating Lord Kenyon's absurdities about forestallingand 'egqrating. On the other hand, a loigseries of decisions, to which Lord Campbell points with adequate emphasis, and which must ever be interesting and instructive to those who wish to have a liberal linowledge of our jurisprudence, prove the grasp of Lord Ellenborough's mind, and the amplitude of his qualifications for the highest judicial duties. It is not in oiur power to cite these here, or the comments of Lord Campbell, which are almost of equal value. Suffice it that they include some curious particulars, as the question of the tbeas corpnes in the case of the Hottentot Venus, and the single imputation upon Lord Etlenboroughl, that in deciding that sailors employed in the lobster fishery were privileged from being impressed into the Royal navy he was swayed by his excessive love of lobster sauce as an accompaniment to turbot. "The framers of the law," thus ruled the great Chief Justice, " well knew that the produce of the deep sea without the produce of the shallow water wvould be of comparatively small value, and intended that the turbot wYhen placed upon our tables should be flanked by good lobster sauce." What a solemn aptness, therefore, in the concluding judgment," Let the rule be absolute." Oue curiosity of legal history 'which ocourred in Lord Ellenborough's time should notbe omitted. He had actually to award a trial by battle on the appeal of Richard Thornton, charged with the murder of Mary Ashford, and but that the appellor cried craven the public might havo sean the lists prepared in Tothill-fields. In consequence of the scandal occasioned by this case the statute 59 George IlI., chap. 46 was passed to abolish such appeals, which, as this case proves (for there never was a doubt as to Lord Ellenborough's law), might up to this date have been regularly demanded. In the Court of King's Bench Lord Ellenborough accordingly shone, but he was listened to with much less favour in the Hiouse of Lords, for their lordships "thought that he was not sufficiently refined and polished for their delicate ears, and they complained that he betrayed a most injudicial violence." Even his maiden speech was thus outspoken, and was violent or hearty na critics elect to con- sider it. When, also, he opposed the Athol job, which was a Bill for a robbery of the Excheqier on the plea of conmpensating in an extravagant eeuses the Athol family for certain rights in the Isle of Man d~ whiQh they had been deprived, he blazed ow iBtg fiery but most natural indlgnation. " Let us se," said he, " whether we are notrobbing the Excheq uer to put the plunder into the pocket of an accomplice. The times are critical; our dangers are great; the state of our finances is hopeless; let us not, my lords, imitate the conduct of reebless sailors in a storm, who, when they see the vese driving on the rocks, instead of trying ti save her, throw up the helm, abandon the sails, and falU to breaking opent the lockers. If we would avoid the thunderbolts of Divine vengeance which seem ready to burst upon us, let us rather deck eurselvos in the robes of virtue, and with-the love of God lft us iryto recover the love of the people, of whom we ought to be the proteto-rs, not the spoliators. Be the event what it may, liberazi 4niimam meam." In supporting the Volunteer Consolidation Bill he gave vent to his martial ardour vfith almost equal impressiveness. On the trial of Colonel Deapard Lord Campbell, who was present, calls to mmifi his " dignifie , impressive, and awe-inspiring deportment." But he caused some dissatisfaction by snubbing the great Nelson, who, when called to give the priEoner a character, was proceeding to describe h' gallant conduct in several actions, and whom ho cut short sarcastically with, "I am sorry to interrupt your Lordship, bu' we cannot hear what I dare say your Lordship would give with great effct-the history of this gentleman's military life." Hit language in sentencing Colonel Despard and his uzocia.'es, and which Lord Campbell quntes, was. ho wever, particularly solemn and appropriate. Lord Ellenborough also presided at the fu:. trial of Peltier for libel, where the prosec was Napoleon Bonaparte. On the forma%:r the Broadlottom Administration, 2; t+), In-a' Addington, he wa offered tha [-. .-: . Seal, but Bk poeitively refoued it. Yet he entered the Cabinet, th' nugh contianhng Chief Justice; and the incongroity of the positions does not -appear to have struck him or his colleagues until it was forced, upon their attention by the storm it excited. The motions on this subject made in the Houses of Lords and Commons were easily negatived, but the imputation stuckr, and after a time, it is said, he himself expressed dissatisfaction with his position. There are some letters quoted at this point to show that he acted cordially with Fox, and on the death of Fox he continued a Cabinet Minister till the entire dissolution of the Government of All the Talents. Lord Grenville bore testimony to his frank and honourable conduct when their conrexion was about to sever; and both in Parliamen' and en the bench no one could fairly impugn his integrity and independence. Thus he charged the jury for ;>he acquittal of Perry, of tshe Mornirng (inronaicle, to the great disgust of Sir Vicary Gibbs, the AttorneyGeneral; while, on the other hand, he did his best to convict Leigh Hunt. He was afterwards included in the commission for the " delicate investigation," and vindicated his conduct thereon with violence and asperity, but nevertheless without leaving the faintest blemish of any other kind adhering to him, except, it may be, the venial error of judgment which Lord Campbell mentions. His best speech in the Lords was in defence of Lord Sidmouth's circular letter. After the permanent insanity of George III. and the establishment of the Regency he was appointed a member of the Queen's Council, ti aSsist her in the custody and care of the King's person, but he never incurred the imputation mada against Lord Eldon-that he varied in his view o the King's case according to his view of his own interests. In short, he refused all intrigues, and was " only solicitous that the truth should be diEclosed, and that justice should be done to the King, to the Prince, and to the nation." On the other hand, his Lordship unquestionably incurred obloquy from its being supposed that h pressed too hard upon Lord Cochrane in the- celebrated trial which resulted in a conviction since considered to have been unwarranted. The Chief Justice was vehemently assailed in consequence of his severe sentence on this occasion, and the public censure, it is said, preyed upon his mind and affected his health. On the trial of Dr. James Watson in 1817 for high treason he was no longer the same man. His strength was so muchl exhausted that in summing up he was obliged to ask Mr. Justice Bayley to read for him a considerable part of the evidence, In the following autumn he !hade a short tour on the Continent in order to recruit, and a beautiful prayer composed by him at Pariq, when his health and strength were declining, Is a proof of the religious consolations which he ,ought as his hold upon earthly interests was relaxin*. He returned to take his seat in the Court of King's Bench, and in his enfeebled condition wrestled hard with a reluctant jury to procure the condemnation of William Hone. But in three successive trials the culprit triumphed, and the Chief Justice, on his return home, was followed by a tumultuous mob, of whom he remarked that "he was afraid of their saliva, not of their bite." The popular notion was that Hone's trial killed him, and he certainly never held up his head in public afterwards. Be was unable to go the summer circuit, and his absences from court became more and more frequent, until, after trying a variety of expedients, on the 21st of September; 1818, he tendered his resignation, signed the necessary instrument on the Gth of November, little more than a month later expired at his house in St. James's-square, and at his own request was interred in the Church of the Charterhouse, in grateful remembrance of his debt to its foundation. A rigorous and somewhat awful presentment of justice was thereby withdrawn from the public gaze. "1 I never," said one who was well acquainted with him, "knew any man, except. the Duke of Wellington, who was so innately just. . . . When he took as his motto Compcsitum jus fasque animi, he stamped his own character upon his shield. Of his rigour the Act which goes by his name, and which was the only one he ever introduced into Parliament, is a memorable proof, for it created 10 new capital felonies, and helped to raise a cry against capital punishmentgenerally. Of the awe which he inspired Lord Brougham gives an illustration from the dinners in Serjeants'-inn, where etiquette forbade - the saying a word after the Chief Justice or tha commencement with him of any topic of conversation. Yet, Westminster-hall used to abound with his current facetiur, the best of which even contained an element of judicial gravity. To the young counsel who commenced stammering about " hi, miforhatwnate client," he uttered the famous encouragement, " Go on, Sir; so far the court is with you." So, also, he took down and repeated with ironical emphasis and thanks the elementary statement of Mr. Preaton, the conveyancer, that " an estate in fee simple is the highest estate known to the law of England," and when that very learned person asked when-it wiould be their lordships' pleasure to bear the reinainder of his argument added-" Mlr. Preston, we are bound to hear you out, and I hope wve shaU do so on Friday; hut, alas ! pleasure has been long out of the question." To another conveyancer, who occupied the court a whole day about the merger of a term, "I am afraid, Sir," said he, "the term, although a long one, 'will merge in your argument." One of the solemn asseverations of James Allan Park, who had the character of being particularly sanctimonious, ho even visited with a fine for profane swearing. A great sessions lawyer in a minina case, contending at enormous length that the stone to be niined could only be reached by deep boring, which waa a mnatter of science, he said, " You will hardly succeed in conivincing uis, Sir, that every species of baorlu is 'matter of science."' In the case of another counsel, who was observing, "In the hbooc of nt,,ttre, my Lord, it is written," he intorpii-ieid, " Will you havo the goodness to mentioli the paurm, $ iri'? (Of a witness who in reply to the questionl " what ho was," said, "I employ nmyself ml n. isurgeon,'" ho inqulired, " But does any ore e /lse emnplo)y YOU as a surghon I" Thns a judicial approI,ria{eneea gnve relevance to his wit, and even his casual jest was a sort of dAtit dictuem. He was amiable in domestic life, and there were genial phases to the charactr which lhe bore for dignitv and energy. But the predominance of his judicial qualifications was so considerable that his description may be fairly summed up in the assertion that he was one of that greater class of judges who at rare intervals have presided in Weatminster-hall, and who have elevated their profession by their own judicial eminence.

Dr. Lloyd presided. Invitations ware acknowledged from Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Waterford, and after the claims of those loca.itiea had been duly discussed, the honour fell upon Leeds by a large majonty. Profeasor Owen was e]ected presidentfor 1858. In 1859 Aberdeen is to be the muster place, and the Association have every reason to hope that the Prince Consort, even though his Royal Highness may be prevented from taking part in the proceedings, will be induced to take the office of president for that year. The great attractinyeaterday, or rather last evening, waw the lecture of Dr. .ivingston on "Afrcan Discoveries," which *wa delivered to a crowrded audience in 'the newv museum of the Royal Dublin Society-houise. The Eal% of Carlile was present, and when the eloquent I.ecturer had conduded his Exceliency rose and Eaid - "Mr. Piesident, my Lords, ladies, and gentlemen,-Though I.se beforri now appeared in the capacity of a lecturer, tis'udiew,o aneed not fear thAl lam going to discharge that .oflice s.t nr.st, haTe only to suggest to them that we b.aveall to runit in an office of gratitude to the able, enterprYia-g, an ' -d man (applause) who has just mAde us the estc f se' .ns imuderings and researchs I know fI woell that lIe plafditS of evensugch ai eminant and brilliant compaDy as this jas arefar,from being one of the main objecta wv icL simtilaitom'inhi beneficentand elf-denyingcareer .0, ;' is no unUc ming adjunct e*en to his high lubours hte is thus enabledto iompart blameless entertainment, to mpart laudable ouiioslty, perhaps to awaken somo sImzlar Isptks of e,nterprise (hear, hear and* devotedness in congeial breasbt, and. happily to point the way to procesaes of cultivation ana channels of discovery which may have blessed and magnificent results in the preoordained rrangements of heaven.

I wll only say of that teresting region which has been the theatre of his journeyings, that while the high behests of empire and of justico may now be calling upon some of our countrymen in that other great continent of the olden world-to the far Asia-in the discharge of stern and painful duties, I trust that in that Africa, to which Europe owes such great atonement, our countrymen may never he called upon to discharge any other misaions than those vhich relate to extended commerce, increasing civilization, and Christian philinthropy_ (Applause.) I feel sure that the full, the shrewd, and the graFphfc lecture to which we have had the pleasure of listefsug wtil be reckoned not one of the least agreeable and profitable occupations of the week in which I trust all concerned bave felt as I am sure they ought to feel, unmixed satisfaction.

(Applause ) "The Rev. Dr. LIvLsGSTroT briefly responded." IRISH UNAIMITY. In the column devoted to commercial intelligence in the FreemaW's oturnma there are some true and creditable remarks in reference to the gtate of feeling in Dublin, and perhaps in all Ireland, with regard to the hideous circumstances which have characterized t'-e Incdian mutiny. The writer says *- " The feeling on the Indian news in the mercantie world is very strong. Any idea of Jealousy between English and Irish interests seems quite to be lost in a feeling of intense indignation and disgust at the atrocities which would have disgraced even tha most noble cause for which ever arms were taken; and though it might be supposed that an East Indian question would have little sympathy here, the outrages committed have completely divested the cause of tne insurgents of the slightest sympathy, and, as far as regards the mercantile classes of this city, Protesants or Catholics, Liberals or Conservatives, we find but one feeling-that of a patriotic indignation against the savages who have so outraged our countrymen and countrywomes, as well as those of the sister country, and an enthusiastic admiration of the heroic courage displayed by Eo many of whom Ireland as well as England nas cause to be proud.," So long as the leading organ of the Roman Catholic and ultra-Liberal party in Ireland continues thus faithfully to represent the true state of feeling as regards the disasters in India, people can alms st afford to laugh at the rabid outpourings of a few journals which affect to believe that the days of vitriol bottles and boiling lead are still hallowed in the memory of the Dublin rabble. Does Mr. John lMitchel himself, the incarnation of sedition in 1848, telieve that such sentiments as follow find any eating place in the breasts of Irishmen not actually dementedc - " Sweeter than the voice of love, sweeter than the warm accents of friendship, dearer than the mellowfet sbnsbine of the heart is the news of English discomfiture in India to the breasts of the Irish people. They are delighted, rejoiced, and gladdened beyond measure when the hear of the torture and humiliation of theirancient foe. There is not a vessel of hers which is wrecked, there is not a general of hers who is slain, there is not a battalion in her service -which is routed and overthrown, that the people of ILeland do not gloat over with the greatest satisfactmin and delight. From the deepest recesses of their hearts they wish her defeat and misfostune in whatever enterprise she Is engaged. Loyalists, slaves, sycoliants, and West Britons may seem astonaded by aU this, but from our knowledge of the people we can asure them that what we have stated is a fact. The Irish millions wish to see England subdued, her insolence chastised, her barbarons and tyramnical power broken to pieces, her domineering and brutal disposition tamed and sobered dos.n, and her outrageous desire to annoy, bully, insult, and plunder weaker natiors rendered impotent and powerless for evil for all time to come. They are consequently delighted by the intelligence received from the East, where the forces of the Great Mogul are pounding the armies of Great Britain. Wherever England draws tbe sword or lights tbe match Ireland prays for her defeat, and at no time has she prayed more fervently in that way than she de es now, when the patriot Sepoys of India are endeavouring to strangle the British power and sweep it root and branch from tho fair and fertile fields of Hindostan." PATAL COLLISION AT SEA The Cork Eimaniier of yesterday reports the following casualty at sea:- " Yesterday morning a large American ship, the Western Star, of Boston, put into Queenstown, nesrly in a sinking condition. About 2 o'clock that morn;ng she came into collision with a strsnge vessel off the Old HIead of Rinsale, went right over her, sending her to the bottom, with every one on board. So sudden was the occurrence, the two vessels meeting in the dark, that the crew of the Western Star could only mnake out that the other was P bark, but could ascertain nothing of where she wa,q from, or to what nation her crew belonged, except that .( n,o of the latter who were on deck wben sbe was struck I e peared to be neither American nor British. A Genoese ship arrived also yesterday, the captain *f v hich expressed his opinion that the lost ves^^sel was fromn his country, but in all probability it will never be Clearly ascertained what ship sBe was or where she was from. Son.e merchant will, no doubt, miss her, and many hearts will beat anxioutly in vain for the return of those who formed her crew, but none 'Kill he able to say positively that she was the one they loolced for. The Western Star was bound from Rio to Falniouth for orders, with sugar and rice, and she was towed op to the Victoria Dock, at; Passage, yesterday, a3onp5ido I of which sho now lies, men being employed constantly at the pumps to keep her afloat, as her cutwater was carried away and severdl planks in her bottom were started."1T FNS iTIll FTJNDS.

CVOURT 07 BANKRUPTCY, BihA4frltd &p4 L Ix RR tK MP wn .V (Bcforc Afr. COMMinioner FONBLArW?:Ll The bankrupts wen billbrokers of NIcholas-lane. This was their certificate meeting. The balance-sheet comeneeY in May, 1852, and ends in a, 1857. The bankrupts appear to hare commenced with a capital of 1,676L, and they owe to creditors 6,494!., tbe liabilities being 28,192M, sLome of which have rua off snce the bankruptcy. The net pro6ts during the five years are set (town at 14,479L, while the expens were 1,9594 The doubtful debtors amount to 5,948t. The only atat in hand are 2204 in cash and the ame amount in bills. Mr. Ldwiu1icx, who repreented the aDiuees did not offer any opposition, and stated that the principl creditors were satisfed with thecoonduct of the bankrupts both before and after their bankruptcy. He wrent through the main figures of the balAnce0-heet and pointed out what his clients oonsidered were the more fsVourable aspects of the cae The profits were lsrge and the trade expenditure was nost reasonable, and he did not think any person could say that the partners' drawings for five years (9,OOOL) werein any way iummodeate. The books were well kept, a!d baLAnoed day by day, he believed, up tothe evening before the failure. At the timae of the stoppage the bankrupts were losers to the amount of 9,OO in respect of fictitious bills put into circulation khrough the agency of a Mr. Holland anvd others but by subsettaent payments that deficiency wa- reduoed to 1,4004 The bankrupts had rendered every arsistanoe in their power to the asdgnees, who ad expressd their wish tht fret-olaw certificates smould be gr nted. Mr. Hermann, a creditor for 651, oppoeed, and dated that the bankrupts had been guilty of irregularities in the ourse of their buiness, they being in the habit of receiving hills for discount ruder "approval,' passing them over to their bankers immediately, and then offering part essh and part promissozy notes at long dates for the respective amounts, He considered that the bankrupts had been expensive in thair habits; and, in fact, abe-tt the time they were in difficultieg Mr. Kemp had actuall~y given a bal mwqu4, whic had cost upwards of 20014 lr. SLEIGH opposed for Mr. Maude, a creditor for 3004 And costs of an action for false imprisonment, and sked for a total refusal of certificates. The bankrupts were not 3ovices in this courk for they had both failed. Mr. Kemp was bankrupt in 1849 for 15,000L The estte paid a most miserable dividend, and a third-class certificate was granted after three months suspension. Mr. Kemp said a second.class certificate was granted. tir. SLMCIL-Well, Mr. Kemp may take credit for a second-class certificate. With r"pect to Mr. Clay, he was bankrupt in 18S0, and id lOs. d. in the pound, and obtained a low-clsa certiS.ate. He (ir. Sleigh) than called the attention of the Court to the position of Mr. Mande, whom the bankrupts had prosecuted upon an indictment for obtaining money trom them by means of false pretences. Mr. Maude had been acquitted of the charge, and had subsequently obtained a verdict against the bankrupts for 3001 in respect of their malicious prosecution. Mr. Maude had been ruined bythe bankrupts, who had resorted to this Court Immediately upon finding themselves defeated urn the trial of the action. In order to obtain funds to defeud the cause Mr. Kemp had assigned his furniture to Messrs. Miller and Horn, his solicitors, and they had made advances. It now turned out that the furniture was still being used byy Ur. Kemp's family at Maida-hill, where the bal ma,sq was given. He submitted that the los3es (6,0004) and the ad debts must be deducted from the profits before any credit were given to the bankrupto on that ground. That b>eing done, it would be seen that they had not been living upon their profits but npon their creditors. The COirahL^SISSroS inquired whether it vrould be exsdient to try the validity of the bill of sale at oommon Mr. LAwAstNc said that his clients were quite utisfied that it was executed bondfide, but that if the Court thought proper the assignees' names could be used in an action, provided the undertakiDng were given to pay costsk He could pot allow the joint estate to be burdened with tho espenses of proceedings arising out of the separate estate of Kemp. Mr. SLRilG could not consent to anything of the sort. The Co3sierssioNxa ordered the question as to the bill of sale to stand over until Tuesday next, in order that Mesrs Miller and Horn might be communicated with. Mr. BAGLxy then addressed the Court on behalf of the bankrupts, and said there was not a tittle of evidence to support the allegations of the other side. For the first four years of the five tha business had been successfully carried on, and the bad debts were singularly small If the large losses through the fictitious bu bad not occurred, and other unfortunate circumstances had not happened, there would have been nofailureatalL He wasprepered with tabularstatement giving the particulars of all? the doubtful debts. The statement about the bal tnesqud was a pure exaggeration. One of Mr. Rem'o's sons had come of age, and a few guests were invited to celebrate the event. That was the only ground for the assertion of Mr. Hermann, and the total expenses of tho evening did not amount to above 22L He atibated the expenditure of L2004 per annumn on the part of Mr. Kemp to the lareness of his family, and the consequent outlay in their education. The many losses in the end of 1855 had arisen from the protracted prere in the money market, He produced a memorial from some of the creditors, expressdng their satisfaction with the bankrupts'oonduct. The CoisinssioNxE.-I cannot adjudicate in this case until I have read the examinations with reference to the bil of sale, and until I know what oourse will be pursued as to the alleged fraudulent preference; but it may be some satisfaction to the parties for me to state, that there having been no case of fraud made out against the bankrupts it is quite clear they will have certiicates, but, looking at the expenditure and other facts of the ease, I do not think t,hey will be certificates of the first class, The matter will hee spoken to on this dar week. Adjourned accortiinglr. IN RE SPEGEL aSnORICx A certificate meeting was held. The bankrupt ras an importer of foreign goods, and carried on business at Coleman-street. Mr. NORTON opposed for a creditor, on the ground that the bankrupt bad foolishly expended his money inthe establishment of a Gernan theatre, which, it appeared, had been opened for three nights only at an expenso of 2214 Ar. CErtDLxy having been heard in support, The Com,TSnsioNcR said, the bankrupt had been most foolish in getting counected with a theatre. Any person who joined either a theatre or a mine was sure soon to be utterly ruined. The certificate would be whoUy refused, and no protection would be given. The bankrupt, upon hearing the decision, made a precipitate retreat from the court.
POLICE. MANSIOc1-HOUsE.-Edward Pearson, traveller in the service of Messrs. Castle and Co., wine merobants in Lower Thames-street, was brought before Mr. Alderman CuBr-r, npon remand, charged with embezzling the moneys of hls erfployers-. Evidence was given of five differenit cases in wfhich the prisoner had received sums of money for his employers without having acounDted for them. The prisoner, who sazid he should reserve his defence, was fully committed for triaL. William Macgire and Joseph O'Brien, labourers in the docks, appeare in answer to a summons which charged them with having cruelly beaten and illtreated Bridget Kidney, an Irish servan' girl. Mr. Alderman CuBIIT sentenced Maceguire to two months' imprisonment with hard labour, and ordered O'Brien to pay a fine of 40s., or in default to be imprisoned 14 days. GrILDHALL.-A respectably-attired foreiguer, who gave his namo and address as John Pass, of 13, Euston-square, was charged with obtaining 131. under falee pretences, with intent to defraud Isaac Simmons, a general dealer, of Field- Mr. Wontcer appeared for the defeneo. Rachel Simmous said,-On Monday, the 24th of Augnxt, tbh prisoner came to our shop and offered some gold chains for sale. I was present, and saw the prisoner show 13 gold chains to my husband, who offered 1-21. for them, at the arne time informing the prisoner there was not much gald in the chains, The prisoner said he was welcome to try them, and refused to part with them for 121. My husband then offered him 1.31., rhich he accepted, and gave the parcel of chains, which had been packed up again after my husband examined them, and which turned out to be only brass chains. I did not see the prisoner again until yesterday, when I gave him into custody. He offered me all the money he had, amounting to 30a. Pol ce-constable 226, of the city police force, said-I took the prisoner into custodyatthe shop of Mir. SimmonsinFieldlane, and on being told the charge I saw him drop something behind him, which I ascertained immediately after wvas a parcel containing 1hd chains similar to these broduced by the last witnesi. There wrere also 13 weoddtng rings ether things, a gold chain with a bunch of hair attacheda Isaac Simmons said,-When my wife called me dowrn to see the prisoner he said he had some chains to sell, but 1 told him they would not suit mic. He, however, persuaded mne to look at them, and said they were in his wany of business, and that he bad taken them in exchange. I thought them very common, and said I should not like to buy them en my own judgment. He then asked me to take one to a pawnproker and asoertain the value, or take them anywhere I liked. I selected one chain, and, having detached a portion of it, I had it assayed, and found that there was such a small quantity of gold in it that the chain was only worth 15s. an ounce. The 13 chains weighed l8oz., and I told the prisoner I could not buy them at the price he wanteu for thom, and offered him 121. for them. The chains bad been tied up m a paper parcel, and on my making th-t offer the prisoner put the parcol in his pocket, and said he could not sell them at the price, upon which I offered him 1314, which he accepted, and he drew from the same pocket what appeared to be the same parcel of chains. I paid him the money, and asked him for a receipt. He said he would give me one, and went out to get a receipt stamp; but after some time had elapsed, and findiing he did not return, 1 examined the parcel of chains he had left wvith me and found they were not the same I bargained for. I had one of them assayed, and found that they vwere worthless, having not one particle of gold in them. I positively swear that the chains preduced are not the chatns I purchased. The parcel of chains found on the prisoner are precisely similar to those he left with me, but they are not the same I paid for. Those I bought were smaller chains. The off6cer said,-l found on the prisoner this card, bearisg the name of the manufacturer of these chains at Birmingham. The prisoner has given a false address. Alderman H TE.-This is a very imnportant matter, and I shall therefore remand the prisoner for the attendance of the refiner. Bo-v-sTRsFT.-A boy of 13, named Henry Way, the son of a ladies' shoemaker, living in Peter-street, Westminster, was charged with attempting to commit suicide.

ThAsrES.-Capt;ain John William Doyle, the ruter of the bark John lugars from Ceylon, was charged with various sets of cruelty to a sailor boy named Robcert Eastick, wrho, it was alleged, wras driven to commit suicide bs the h urinn tretment of the captain and the ifi-usage exercised towards Prince Montague, a man of colour, said he was cook of the John Ingars, now lying in the St. Katharine Dock, ort ber last voyage from Hartlepool to Ceylon and back toLondon. The deceaed, Robert Eastick, shipped at Hsrtlepool, and was a healthy boy wbhen he came on board, and appeared to be about 15 year of age. He had repeatedly seen the captain lll-use the deceased and flog himt with reef points (rones), with eyes in them, anci as3o kick him and knock him down. The bo hbau nothing but his blue shirt to protect his back when he Wa* flogged with a rope. The captain also compelled the bo to roarch up and down the deck like a soldier, with a hand. spike on his shoulder. This punrishment was inflicted very often in the evening, after he had done his work. The captain beat the boy very severely with a rope about a cheese that was lost. He had repeatedly heard the boy call out e IMurder, marder, save me, save me !" in the cabiu. | vhile the captain was beating him. One day after the boy wasgflogged he was crying, and upon receivmg his dinner said, "Ah, cook, this is the last piece of doff (pudding I sball ever receive from you." He thought then that the Ind was meditating suicido. About a fortnight afterwards the boy was very shamefully beaten by the captain in the cabin, and called out "Murder !" and shrieked. He saw' the boy's shoulders and arms and they were red ants blue, and oovered with weQs. The boy was cry. ing, and said he could not endure it any longer. vO the same day the boy came to him in the galley or cook. house on deck with a biscuit, ind asked him to pour somehot water upon it for the captain. While he was doing so the boy disappeared. Mr. YAXDLEY.-H1 vanished that evening from the ship ? WitnePs.-He did, Sir. I hear a cry that the boy was. overboard, and he was drowned. Mr. Walter Pelbam said the prisoner, for -whom he appeared, had been taken into custody only during the last hour, and was quite unprepared with any defence. He therefore applied that the further investigation shonld be postponed until Saturday next, when he should be ready tocross-examine the witnesses and enter upon the defence, The magistrate agreed to this, and accepted bail for the accused. LA.iBETH.-William Collins, a powerful fellow, havin' the appearance of a "navvy" and a prizefighter. waschaged v.ith committing a most savage assault on his vife. The complainant wvas so w eak from ls of blood as to require support on entering the court. hen sworn she said that at about 2 o'clock that morning sbe got out of bed to let her busband in, and the moment she opened the door he commenced abusing her. She hastenedback to her bedroom, followed by the prisoner, cnd as soon as sho entered it he made a violent attack upon her, and such was his cruelty that she soon became senseless. Mir. EItorr, observing the poor woman to be In an exceedingly exbausted and dangerous state, ordered tho pliBoier's remand for a week.
INLAND NAVIGATION OF LNDrA.-An influential meeting of merchants and others, was held 3 esterday afternoon in the Manchester Town-hall to receive informationL in reference to the intended operations of the newly-formed Oriental Inland Steam Company. The meeting was addressed by Mr. J. A. T-nmer, M.P., who presided, and by Captain Hall (of the Nemesis), Mr. Bourne, atnd Lientenant Wood, of the Indian navy; these three gentlemen being a deputation from the company. It waS stated that the oom- ary were abont to coma ence the steam navigation of the Iudus,by means of flat-bottomed boats of 24-inches draughtt, trains of which vould be towed by steamboats of 200-horse pover- and under terins of . concession from the East india Conupanv, which was tantamount to a guarantee of 10 perceut, on the outlay. MLanchester enterprise was invited to cc-operate for the extension of the scheme to the Godavery and other rivers, with the view of increasing the supply of cotton. Several gentlemen expressed their conviction of the i-nportanoe of e etending the inland navigation of India, and the chairman, commented emphaticaUly en the urgenoy of tbe cotton £Up. ply question and the apparentw neglect of it by a large portion of tbe trade. Resolntions wvere passed unanimously-, recognizing the importance of the scebme, and appinting an infinential commilttee for the diffusion of im fermation ov the subject and aidiDg the London board in the prompt. execution of the enterprise. A CRIMIAN HERcO.-On Her Majesty's arrival at. Holyrood on Friday evening she noticed a mani in the livery of a park-keeper who was decorated with the Crimean medal and clasps, the China war medal, the u,ed.al given by the Emperor of the Frenoh, and the Victoria Cross.
