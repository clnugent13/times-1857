MONb:Y-MARKBT and OITYINTELLIaBNCA.I TTo.day Evening. l'he quotation of gold t Parls is about 6 per mlle premiumi, and the short exchange on London in 25620 per l. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English MIint price of 31. 17s. 101d. per ounce for staudard gold it appears that gold is nearly 4-lOths per cent. dearer in Paris than in Londoa. By advices from aamburg the price of gold Is 423k per vark, and the short exchange on London is 13-4 per II. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about 1-10th per cent. dearer in Elamburg than in London. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is about 109 per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par betwean the two cJuntries, shows that the exchange is against England; and, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmisaion of gold either way between the two countries. The funds continue without the slightest variation, and are likely to remain stagnant until the arrival of the next India- news, which, after tomorrow, may be expected at any hour. Consols were quoted throughout the day 90i to i for money, and 9ig to i for the 14th of October. India Stock left off at 20 to 212; India Bonds, 23s. to 17s. discount and Exchequer-biUs, 8a. to 4s. discount. The discount-market was without alteration, and a disposition to limit business as much as posaible seems observable in all quarters. The transactions in foreign stocks have been unimportant, and the market generally is without the slightest animation. Chilian Six per Cents. have been negotiated at 105; Mexican, 21i, i, and I; Peruvian Foi,r-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 79; ditto Three per Cents., for the account, b6; Portuguese, 45a; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 99, 99i, and i ; Spanish Deferred, for the account, 2.5;; Turkish Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 990; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 100. In the fo~reian exchanges this afternoon the rates generally wuere a shade higherthaBn last post. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents, on t e Paris Bourse this evening wero 66f. 95c. for money and G6f. 90c. for the end of the month. shovving a decline of a quarter per cent. The Moutmorency has arrived from Melbourne with 50,195 oz. of gold, valued at 200,7801. A considerable portion of this will probably be taken to the Bauk. The suggestion in the recent report of the Select Committee on the Exchequer, Pay, and Audit Departments for improvements in the system of issuing Exchequer-bills, so as to get rid of the annual inconvenience of their beinz sent in for renewal, and to facilitate the interest payments by furnishing them with coupons, has led to the question being raised whether the issue of Exchequer-biUs in any sbape is utder present circumstances desirable. The only recommendations that could ever have been urged for them were, first, that they enabled the Govermnent to raise any sum that might be requisite for temporary circumstances in a form to admit of its being easily paid off when the requirerment had termninsated; secondly, that they supplied the 6inancial public with a singuarly eligible medium for the employment of floating balances; and, thirdly, that owing to this fact they would circulate at a rate of interest considerably below that at which loans could be raised by the creation of stock. All these advanjtages, however, have now disap- eared, and as the existence of a heavy unfunded debt has at aU times certain inherent objectionable features, it is natural that doubts should be raised whether these should be submitted to when there are no longer any counteracting circumstauces to render them unimportant. The Issue of Exchequerbills mer. ly for casual purpo3es has long passed into a more fxtensive arrangement, by which the total has bf en swollen so as to represent nearly a fortieth part of the entire national debt, aboet 17,000,0001. or 18,000,0001. being at all times in the hands of tho public. The facilities which caused them to be acceptable to financiers have been utterly eclipsed, chiefly by the attractions offered bythebanks and discount houses inreceiving depositsat call,andpartlyby the higher terms payableon railwvay debentures; and, finally, so far from their now effecting an economy to the Government by their rate of interest being below that of the funds, they cannot even be kept from a discreditable discount by an interest of 31.16s. Oid. per cent., while any amount could be raised in stock at about 31. 6s. or 31. 7s. per cent. Whether the new regulations recommended by the committee would in any important degree remedy this disparity may be doubted. The fact is, the Government themselves have for years past contrived as far as possible to damage this species of security at the very time when other changes in the monetary world were tending in the same direction. The first blow was inflicted by abolishing the regulation under which they were receivable for revenuepayments at anyperiod afterthreemonthsfrom their date of issue ; and subsequently Sir Charles Wood and Mr. Gladstone, by obstinately allowing ihem to fall to a heavy discount, and to remain unsaleable at times of severe pressure, thoroughly completed the mischief. There is hardly a banker or money-dealer who has not a sore recollection of losses and anxieties most unjustly thrown upon him in this manner, and the prejudice created will last for years to come. It is, therefore, full time to consider whether the annual pecuniary loss entailed by these securities, together with the discredit of seeing the current obligations of the Government daily quoted at a discount, should not be got rid of by funding the whole, or, at all events, so large a portion of them as would enable the remainder to float and to command a respectable premium at a reduced interest. At a meeting just held of the London, Manchester, and Foreign Warehouse Company a resolution was adopted to wind up. The company was formed at the beginning of last year with a capital of 50,0001., in 101. shares, on which 81. had been paid. Nearly the whole has been lost, and it seems to have been intimated that, unless litigation could be avoided, a call of the remaining 21. per share might be necessary. The delays and expenses of the Banlkruptcy Cour' were, as usual, held up to terrify the shareholders against allowing any measures to be taken that might bring the company under that jurisdiction, and by this means a public exposure of the nature of the management wiU most probably be evaded. The Journal de Comstantinwple announces the arrival of some EDglish engineers with materials to establish telegraphic communication between Alexandretta aud the Persian Gulf. The following are from Australian companies - " ENGLISH AND AusTRLiAN COPPER. "Advices have been received from the manager, dated at the works, July 4. The smelting of copper had continued without interruption until the 30th of Jine, when aU the furnaces had been let out for the purpo-e of the annual taking of stook. As soon as this was completed six furnaces would be relighted. Mr. Eamilton says: At the present n oment it is doubtful whether we exceed a little or fall short a litti of the 2,000 tons copper in the year; it cannot be more than five or ten tons one way or the other."' " PORT PIJILLIP AND COLONIAL GOLD. "Advices have been received from the resident director, dated Melbourne, July 22. The machinery for carrying on the business of quartz crushing at Clnnes had been erected, and had been at work for several weeks. Many impediments had occurred in the working of the machinery at the outset, as is generally the case, but these were being overcome, and the business at the last date was going on steadily. Mr. Bland says :-' The quartz has improved in yield, therefore all anxiety on this head is removed, and a abort time, I hope, will render the machinery quite effeclive. I consider that it only requires management and economy to mrake this undertaldng answer.' MIr. Thompson, the superintendent at Clunes, states, under dite the 13th of Jnly :-' The kiln of quartz now going through is yielding 2Joz. per ton; anotber, vhich will be fired on Monday, is expected to produce over 3oz. per ton; and even the second quartz has given more than lioz. per ton. There can therefore be no doubt of the productive character of the veins, and the ultimatesucces of the whole operation. The omnpany receives a remuneration of 3t. per ton for crushing the quartz for the sining Company, but it is not concered in the mining rsk.

FATAt BOILBm EXLosIxON IN DlmxHm.-About 9 o'clock on Sunday morntng, one of the boilers at tbe Tiindon Grange Colliery exploded with a loud report, It shook the earth. The report was keard for about a raile distant, and was something like the explosion of a magazine of powder. The chin,ney was split, the stone walls blowa to atoms, the boilers shifted out of their places, and a larg) number of houses damaged by bricls, stones, pu11eys, metal pipes, &c. The boiler had split in two; tho upper Part was blown over the top of six or eight housee, and fell luto a pond about 100 or 120 yards' Glstane from the plaoe. The other part was lifted over the engines, houses, and rail'way, on to the dustheap, at a distance of about 150 yards. On clearing away the stones and ruxbbish near where the boiler stood, the bodies of two young men were discovered, the one named John Orton, the other Roper, the fireman. They were dreadfully scalded, and of course quite dead. A child playing in the streets 'was strack by one of the brioks, and tbere seems to be little or no hope of its recovery.- Mfanchuscr Guardian,
ERAIL WP AY AND MINING SRARM Talty Ev ,. The rawilay-market has again been heavy, and in nearly aU thb Sp4culitive descriptionm a further decline has taken place. The deprefion is caused principally by the restricted character of business and the indisposition of the dealers to incrse the I amounts in their hands; hence, in the absence of buyers, comparatively unimportaut sales exrcises a sensible effect. On the other hand, Great N9rthern irnproved. Grand Trunk of Canada receded 21.; Buffalo and Lake Huron, Great Western of Canada, Geelong and Melbourne, and East Indian were also lower. In French shares the Late rise has not been fuly maintained; and Great Luxein1ourg and Lombardo-Venetian fractionally declined. In American, Illinois Central shares and New York Erie bonds receded. In mines, East Bisset again improved. A redaxction of l1. oecurred in Bank of London; English, Scottish, and Australian Ohartered were rather higher. In micellaneous secu-. rities, Australian Agricultural and Peel River Land improved, the latter owing to a report of rich gold discoveries at the Hanging Rock and Peel diggias.

BAIL WAY IMITbLLIGENcx, RAILWAYS IN TRf TTNmRRn urTnir The reportf Captain D. Galton, ILK, to the Lords of the oesmitte of Privy Council for Trade and Fore6n Plantations, of the prooeedlngs of the departnaegi relating to railways for the year 1856, state that 59 railway Bils were passed in the session of 1856, authorizing 322 miles of railway, the capital being 5,784,42. Of the 59 Acts 38 were for the construction of 214 mileg of railway in England and Wales, 106 miles In Sootland, and about two miles in Ireland. The number of level crosdngs authorized wa 93. 22 of the Acts authorized companies to enter, into work. lug and traffic arrngements with other oompanles, sabject to the approval of the shareholders and of the Board ofTrade. The total length of railway authorized by Parliament down to the end of 1856 amounted to 14,668 miles; but of this 1,495 miles have been authorized to be abandoned, leaving 13,163 miles for which Parliamentary powers have not been repealed; of these 8.635 miles were open for traffic at the end of 1856, including 355 miles opened during that year, and 4,538 miles remain to be opened -namely, 3,316 mUes in England and Wales, 452 in Sootland, and 770 in Ireland. le dote not think it probable that 2,532 miles of those lines Will ever be made, the powers for the compulsory purchase of land having been allowed to expire without havIng been exercised. The totA amount of ruoney authorized to be raised by raUway companies by Shres and loans to the end of 1856 amounted to 377,767,90Th1, of which 308,775,894u. had been raised, leaving 68,992,013n. to be raised. Of the 8,718 miles open for traffic on the 31st of December, 1856, 6,737mnles werenarrow gauge, 679 miUes broad gauge, 2.5 miles mixod, and 1,048 iiles Irish gauge. The length of ilngle ineinthelJniteKlingdom at the end of 1856 was 1,562 miles constructed on the narrow gauge, 240 miles on the broad gauge, 72 miles on the mixed gauge, and637 miles on the Irish gaUge, making together 2,511 miles of single line. It hl become a very general practioe for railways which are subsidiary to the lines of existing railway companies, and which have been constmuoted by independent companies, to be worked by the existing larger company. This mode of working is advantageous to both parties, and generally to the public, because these agreements create for the time that identity of interest which Is created by an amnalgama, tion, whUe at the same time the existence of the local company provides for the interests of the dis. trict being better cared for than it would probably be if the small lines were entirely merged in the larger company. The length of the line reported to be in course of constraou tion on the 30th of Jnne, 1855, asi 963 miles; of these about 208 miles were opened before the 31st of December, 1856. The number of persons employed on the 30th of June npon the railwase in course of eonstretion amountod to 36,473, being on the average 37N87 per mile. The length of line open for traffic in the United Kingdom on the S3th of June, 1856, was 8,506 miles, and the number of persons employed theroon amounted to 102,U7 persons, or 2 per mile. With regard to the traffic, the total number of passen gers conveyed on the railways in 1856 amounted to 129,347,592, against 118,595,135 conveyed in'1855, the number conveyed per mile of railway open being 15,213 in 1856, against 14,503 in 1855. The receipts from passengen amounted to 10,153,7451. in 1856, against 9,525,205 in 1855, the receiptg per mile being 1,1941. in 1856 and 1,1641. in 1855. Erom the figures given in the appendix, it appears that from 1852 to 1856 the first-class passenger fares in England have been diminished, and thatl the receipts per passenger have also dece6sed, while the receipts per mile have increased. As regards the second-class traffic in England, the fares have been slightly increased, and the receipts per mile have not Taried much. In the third-class traffic, which inclades a large amount of excursion traffic, the average fares were diminished, and the receipts per mile largely increased In Scotland the fares of first-class passengers have been diminished, and the receipts per mile have increased; as regards the second-class traffic the average fare has been increa-ed; the actual receipts are about the same as in 1852, while the receipts per rile have diminished; the average fare for third-class passengers has been increased, and the receipts per mile have also increased. In Ireland the average fare per mile and the receipts from each lass of passengers hare increased, but the receipts per mile, with the exception of the first class, have diminished. The recelpts from goods, cattle, minerals, parcels, &c., in 1856, amounted to 13,011,7481., against 1f,982391in 1854, which represents 1,5301. per mile in 1856, compared with 1,465. per mile in 1855. The total receipts from goods, cattle, minerals, parcels, &c., may be divided as followsviz., 7,685,379l was for the conveyance of 23,823,931 tons of merchandise, 3,585,9911 was for the convey. aace of 40,93q,675 tons of minerals, 517,7861. for the conveyance of 10,450,175 head of live stock, snd 1,222,628l for the conveyance of parcels, &e The ta,bles in the appendix] show that while in 1849 the pro. portion of the passenger traffic to the goods traffic was as 53 to 47, in 1856 the proportion of the passenger traffic to the goods traffio is as 44 to 56. The total receiDts from all sources of traffic have amounted in England and Wales bo 19,728%311L, or 3,1201. er mile, in 1856, aainst 18,363,869k, or 2,9781. in 1 ; in Sootland to 2,319.171, or 2,0224 permile, in 1856, against 2,144,3981., or 2,0031. per mile in 1855; and in Ireland to 1,117,9&55, or 1,0921. per mile in 1856, against 999,8324., or 1,0601. per mile, in 1855. The aggregate receipts from all sources of traffic for the whole hingdom having been 23,165 493l, or 2,7241 per mile in 1856, against21,507,599l, or2,629l permile, inl855. It would appear that the average working expenses of railway companies, per mile of railway open, have increased in England and Wrales from 1,3521. per mile in 1854 to 1,5311. in 1856; in Scotland, from 961l in 1854 to 9701, in 1856; but that in Ireland they bave decrersed from 4651. in 1854 to 4271. in 186. The proportion which the worldng exPenses havo borne to the reoelpts has been 49 per cent, in England and Wales as compared with 48 per cent, in 1855 47 per cent, in Scotland as oompared with 49 per cent, in 1855; and 39 per cent, in Ireland as compared with 41 per cent, in 1855; the general average being 47 per cent. upon the gross receipts as compared with 48 per oent, in 1855 The expenditure appears to be divided under the several heads as follows-viz., maintenanoe of way, 15 per cent.; locomotive expenses, including repairs of rolling stock, 39 per cent.; traffc charges, 26 per cent.; miscellaneous, including police and watchmen, compensation, Sc, 13 per cent.; rates and Government duty, 7 per cent. With regard to the financial position of railways, the report states that the total amount of capital raised for the constraction of railways on the 31st of oecember, 1S56, amounted to 308,775,894l, which represents an expenditure of 35,459Z per mile of railway open. In making this estimate it must be recollected that the lines reported to be in course of construction amount in length to about one-ninth of the whole length completed and under construction, and that some portion of the cost per mile belongs to those lines. But it is worthy of notice that although the cost of rail. ways in the united kingdom has averaged 3.3,4591. per mileviz., 40,2881 in England, 27,7591 in licotland, and 14 8034. in Ireland, the average cost of the independent lines oi railway for which the Acts have been obtained since 1848, and which are now opened for traffic, has only amounted to 9,5681 per mile- of these railways, those open in England have averaged 1l,3731. per mile; those opened in Scotland have averaged 5,4081. per mile, and those opened in Irelanid Is 6,7161. per mile. Of the total amount of money raised 77,359,4191. has been raised by loans, 57,057,171L bypreference shares, and the remnainder-viz., 174,359,31. by ordinary share capital. The preferential and loan capital invested in railways is 43 per cent, of the whole capital and the interest which has to be paid upon the preferentii and loan capital averages 5 08 per cent.; the net receipts on railways give an an average interest on the whole capital invested of nearly 4 per cent,, but the heavy preferential character of the charges reduces the interest on the ordinary capital to 3-12 per cent. It also appears that the receipts of railway companies have increased steadily, although slowly, every year. The large amount of preferential capital has prevented a proportionate increase in the dividends on the ordinary share capital; but the steady increase in the net receipts in a greater ratio than the increase of the cnpital invested is evidence of sound progress. The stability of railway property depends chiefly upon a careful management. Without entering into this question,which is one of great difficulty, owing to the magnitude of the several undertaldngs, the extent of territory they occupy, and the conflicting interests to which they are subjected, Captain Galton calls their Lordships' attention to the fact, that while in 1855 a oase occurred ia which the accounts of a railway company were andited in so lax a manner as to have admitted of a considerable amount of peculationk in many branches of the service, in 1856 an important company suffered great loss in consequence of the defective system of audit having permitted the forgerien of an employd to escape unobserved for a length of time. Be states that frauds thns committed entail serious losses upon shareholders, and that the shareholdere will be continually liable to frauds of this nature untlc a more careful system of audit, and one independent of those directly ooncerned in the management of the railways, be generally adopted, and until a direct responsibility be_placed on those to whom that management is confided. The report concludes by showing the proportion of passengers klled and injured in Great Britain and Ireland from causes beyond their own control to have been small as compared with the number carried 'in the several years from 1852 to 1856 inclnsive. In 1852 the proportion per million passengers conveyed was 01'l killed and 4-20 Injunrd; in 1853, 0 -35 killed and 2 80 injured; in 1854, 0-10 killed and 2-97 injured; in 1855, 0-08 killed and 2-70 inimued; and in 1856 the proportion per million passengers onveyedws 007 killed and 2-18 inju . it thus appers that only one person in 16,168,449 who travehed has-been killed, and one in 458,370 who travelled has been injured from causea beyond their own ontrol ani that the, deree of snfety with which passengers have been conveyed on railways is greater than in any year sinr 1851L YEOVIL AND EXETER. The works on the South-Western extension line from Yeovil to Exeter are progressing rapidly at veaious pointa on the route.

J2ONDOR, WEDNESDA Y, SEPTEMBBR 23, 1857. "Powerful in arts and arms " is the traditional description of great empires, and we cannot doubt that the time is still far distant when skill in the peaceful pursuits of agriculture or manufacture I 'will be sufficient to maintain supremacy amongo mankind. England has been for a century and a half essentially a warlike Power, and has added conquest to conquest by a union of fighting and! trading unexampled in the history of the world. 1 What has been the secret of this great success, this abundance of resources, this never-failing energy and elasticity of spirit? Simply the inherent vitality which exists in the great bulk of our population, the love of adventure and the con- i tempt of danger which mark the youth of the three kingdoms. Englishmen go everywhere; they penetrate to the magnetic pole or to the sources of the Nile. Interest, or philaun thropy, or raere restlessness takes them to regions which the white man has never trod, and: where his race can never settle. They trade,' or colonize, or fight, or preach, or make scientific observations with an indonaitable courage which proves that if Fortune has befriended their country she has been, in the words of the old motto, only the companion of valour. Having, then, all this' raw material of bold spirits and strong limbs, the question arises whether ths best use is made of it. Our high position among nations has been gained (let the moralista ,ay what they please) by arnm, and by arms alone can it be maintained. Now, to fight requires an education, like anything else. Putting aside all the science of modern warfare, it cannot be doubted that the mere handling of a gun is not to 'he learnt in a day or even in a week. Even in the days of javelins and bows, at Troy or at Agincourt, warriors must have been a class. The class might in some cases be extended until it comprised nearly the whole ablebodied popuLation; but extemporized soldiers, men unused to arms and suddenly called upon to march to battle, never could have been depended upon, whatever might be their enthusiasm and courage, like veterans accustomed to warfare or youth trained t9 martial exercises, To the c(aarge, qftWu brought against us by foreigners, of neglecting the military training of our population, it in impossible to avoid pleading gnilty. The Militia has been till within the last few years a mere name, and even now it bears but a small ratio to the population, and in one point it has too great a resemblance to the army. The men are of the same type as our Line soldiers, they come from the same class, are brought together by the same means, and do their duty under the same inducements. There is something wanting to complete the ideal of a volunteer force, actuated by patriotio motives and ready to serve in time of danger with no other reward than the approbation of the country. Such a force, distinct from the regular army, and distinct even from Militia levies, has existed among more than one people. In France, in Prussia, in the United States volunteer troops have played at different times a distinguished part. What is to prevent England from possessing such a force, available at all times for home defence and as an education for actual campaigning abroad? In no other country is the raising of volunteer regiments more practicable. The youth of England. are distinguished above those of any other country by a superabunidant energy, which vents itself in every kind of athletic exercise. Nowhere do we find boys and young men so strong and vigorous, and so ready to encounter fatigues and hardships under the name of amusement. They are not naturally studious, they do not take -willingly to either science or art, but for running, or rowing, or riding, or giving and receiving hard blows in jest or earnest, they are without a rival. Compare with them the students of a French Lyc6e, strolling two and two along the Quartier Latin, and playing dominoes over their lemonade; or the pupils of a German professor, who accompany their instructor during the holydays in a botanical ramble. Our young men seem urged by an irresistible impulse to throw off their excess of energy by every eccentricity of muscular achievement. In one station of life they batter each other in a tbree hours' fight, or walk a thousand miles in a thousand hours. In another they make pedestrian tours over Europe, and climb the highest peaks of Europe and Asia, for the pleasure of having done a difficult thing. Now, might not the nation turn all this vivacity and pugnacity to a useful purpose? In all his sports and feats of strength the young Englishman never thinks of military exercises, simply because there is no' encouragement to think of them. The army is a profession, if not a close corporation, and every one who does not devote his life to arms is merely a civilian, without part or lot in the matter of defending his country. There is no scope for military impulses among those who are not destined to join a regiment, and a set of men who should enrol themselves in a corps of their own, who should choose an uniform and meet together for drill, would subject tl 'mselves to the derision of the young gentlemen of the regular army, and probably the censure of their own acquaintances. And yet the strength of a country like ours must depend on the existence of such a spirit as would be thus ridiculed and repressed. Another branch of our own race has been enabled to dispense with a standing army by the encouragement of volunteer companies, which are always ready to put down domestic tumult or resist foreign aggression. It is no small thing that a town should be able to raise its 500 men within a few hours, and to send them wherever their services may be required. Such a force does not exist in England ; but in old times the case was widely different. Two centuries ago theLondonTrainbands raised the siege of Bristol. Are Londoners now-a-days inferior to the freemen and 'prentices under the STUARTS? We need hardly state our belief that there is no change, and that the bulk of the people have as much capacity for military exercises as ever. Yet it is undoubted that large sections of the community have unlearned the use of arms. The traditional Cockney of farces and comic novels is the type of but too many among us. It is in the power of the nation to remedy this evil, and no time seems more oppor. tune than the present. Two great objects must be attained if we would give security to the empire. We must popularize the army and martialize the population. The gulf must be nalrowed between the soldier and the civilian; the notion of hiring a man to fight for Us, which sprang up during the last century, must give place again to the good old principle of fighting for ourselves. Why should not the preparation of boys and young men for a share in military duty be begun in our schools and colleges? Surely cricket, football, and rowing might be varied occasionally by drill, and, in the case of young men, by practice with firearms. Every city or agricultural district might well have its company of volunteers, electing their own officers, or receiving them by nomination of some competent authority. Suppose that only 30,000 auch trustworthy soldiers were known to exist through Great Britain, how much stronger would be the national confidence at this moment; and it is not only the immediate accession of strength which makes such a force valuable, but the spirit which it infuses into the community. Now, if ever, England requires the services of all classes and conditions of its people, and can little afford to lose any of the energy and devotion with which HEAVExN has gifted them. We are few in number considering the ex;tent and population of the empire, and we are exposed to all that envy can prompt and subtlety accomplish. Every year the numbers which these narrow islands can hold must lessen in proportion to the populations of other States,-our rivals, if not our enemies. Placed among nations whom nature allows to be greater and mightier than us, we are indeed unwise if we neglect any means by which our hard-won supremacy may be maintained.
There is something at any rate "9 Celestiarl about the character of the Chinese. Tlhe suavity of their disposition in the capacity of belligerents is really quite angelic, and we can hardly bring ourselves to employ the designation of " enemies" in speaking of a people so exceedingly accommodating. Months ago, after a desperate quarrel at their chief southern port, we sent out a hostile expedition to bring them to terms, and since then we have had a pretty smart action in the Canton waters, and destroyed the best part of their fleet in those seas. As the demands of India, however, assumed a paramount importance, we diverted the squadron from its destination, and now not only the military but the diplomatic material of the expedition, Plenipotentiary and all, may be found at Calcutta instead of Pekin. In fact, the "Chinese question!, is dropped-dropped after a fashion which neither one party nor the other ever dreamt of when they fought over it at the beginning of the year. Our fine little army set sail for Canton, but heard of another enemy on the voyage, and turned straight away. Most adversaries would havo taken advantage of this,-some, perhaps, even conceived some affront; but the Chinese meet us more than half-way, and give us every possible facility in our new arrangements. As far as they are concerned, we are evidently at liberty to suspend the war for exactly such a time as may be most convenient. By the latest despatches we learn that the absorpion of lie expedition and the diversion of the basy are not in the lemt likely to cc create more extended " difference " between the Chinese and ourselve3; nor will our relations, indeed, with this marvellous empire be exclusively of so neutral a tint. With all the spacious and productive provinces of the North, or, in other words, with the whole of China excepting a certain city on its southern shores, our intercourse continues on that footing of cordiality and friendship which the operations before Canton were never permitted to disturb, whilo the prospects of trade are spoken of in the most sanguine and satisfactory tone. That a ferocious Governor in the corner of the empire should have embroiled himself with some foreign settlers in his vicinity evidently appears no reason at all to the Chinese people why they should quarrel with their own bread and butter, spoil a good business, or go to loggerheads with their best customers. Even in the Canton River these extraordinary creatures seemed to look upon a tough battle as a piece of business altogether disconnected from any animosity or ill-blood. " ru come back to you, you rascals," said KEPPEr, shaking his fist at them, as he drew off from the junks; and the " rascals " forthwith poked their heads over the bulwarks and grinned with the utmost good-humour and satisfaction at the proceeding and the threat. The whole story read more like that of a duck-hunt at a Thames regatta than a desperato and deadly struggle. Lord ELom, it is said, is desirous of taking some Indian troops, in order to bring the rupture to an end; and certainly it is most desirable that two nations who seem to understand each other on all material points so well as the Chinese and ourselves should dispose at once of any accidental irritation. We are not at war with China ; in fact, it does not seem as if we could be, for the Supreme Government of the Empire is inaccessible, and the population is not in the least inclined to inconvenience itself with hostilities. We have a quarrel with Canton, but we are not entangled any further, and the agreeable behaviour of the Chinese is very well calculated to confine the disturbance to its original seat. At first sight, indeed, it is reasonable enough to imagine that a dispute so very politely conducted would soon come to an end of itself, and that nature would effect as good a cure in such a case as the best physician; but we think it would be for the benefit of both countries that the matter should be taken quietly though firmly in hand at the first convenient opportunity, and that we should eradicate from Canton those seeds of turbulence and ferocity which distinguish that district from the rest of the empire. If we look attentively at the aspects presented by our relations with the Chinese at various points, we shall discover two principal characteristics of the people with whom we are dealing-first, a goodnatured businesslike sagacity, and, next, a proneness under particular circumstances to cruelty and violence. The Chinaman is, above all thing,s, a hard-working, self-supporting animaL The overgrowth of population in the country makes the utmost exercise of industry and economy indis. pensable for bare subsistence, and Chinese will contVnue to trade under any conditions, because under any conditions they must live, aud because they can only live by trading. The Dutch in old times used to inflict punishment on certain offenders by placing them in a cell to which water was admitted, and mnaldng them work at a pump to preserve themselves from drowning. A Chinaman works under much the same pressure to escape starvation, and we may rely, therefore, with perfect confidence on the continuance of those commercial relations which we now witness. But, at the same time, life in China is cheap, and ferocity of temper is encouraged by a general cruelty of domestic administration. It is all the more creditable, iadeed, in the Chinese to be so ready for peace, considering how very little they care for the calamities of war. They have learnt to stand to their guns with great steadiness, to handle them with some skiUl, and to encounter Europeans, with no great success indeed, but without much alarm. They reason in a very matter-offact way about the necessity of running away when they cannot fight, are not in the least disheartened by defeat, and usually console themselves by describing it as a victory. Add to all this that not the smallest importance is attached to the expenditure of human life, and we get an idea of the people with whom it is absolutely necessary that we should come to such terms as will preserve an enormous trade and provide our merchants vho conduct it with facilities of peaceable and wholesome residence. There is evidently nothing in the views of the Chinese which should prevent us from obtatning all we desire. In the first place, the chief interests of the two countries are identical. We want to buy tea-the Chinese want to sell it. This trade must be the first object of their lives, and one of the main supports of the population. We find accordingly that nothing can interrupt it-no rebellion in the interior, no hostilities on the coast. Whatever else may be golng on, a Chinaman will certainly bring his wares for sale, and the mere occurrence of hostilities is an incident of such secondary importance that whether the war is continued or suspended signifies very little to the paramount operations of commerce. But this very cheapness of war renders it also likely to be undertaken, and the Chinese, though certain enough to sell us their tea or anything else for which we are willing to pay, would naturaUy be more ready than other nations to fall to blows at the same time. Tndeed, it is hard to see what should 'keep a people from fighting who do not value their lives, and who have no idea that the quarrel should disturb what they do value-their trade. The Celestial Court itself has doubtless imbibed more cautious principles, but its information and its authority aro probably both very imperfect, and the Cantonese can follow the bent of their own minds without much intervention from the Supreme Government. This appears at present to be tho point of difficulty. The disorder is not constitutional, but local. We are at war with the populace of Canton, not the people of China; but that turbulent city has so paraded its insolence and proclaimed its ferocitythat our only security for the future must lie in the abatement of its pretensions. We must enforce this condition, for we have been tied to it by the Cantonese themselves; but if satisfaction can be obtained without bloodshed, the result will be not only gratifyinog in itself, but more in accord with the sentiments which the aocommodating civility of our enemies is calculated to excite. It will really be hard to fight in such very cold blood. When a duel can be supended for six months it ought not to come off at all, and both Chinese and Englishmen may as well put both hands to trade, instead of stridng with one and chaffering with the other.
English legislators and Governments have been subjected to much vituperation on account of their obstinate perseverance in the system of laissez faire. It iB an insular maxim that every man has a right to make his fortune if he can, and to ruin himself if he thinks fit. The proportion of capital employed in trade and speculation is exclusively determined by the judgment of those who own it. If they succeed they attribute the merit to their own sagacity, and- among the excuses for failure they are unable to suggest the interference or remissness of the public authorities. The reverse of commerce and the panics of the Money-market have often been attributed to the absence of official supervison, but the present conditioru ot the Parisian Exchange suggests a reasonablo doubt whether the theories of administration which prevail on the continent provide any wcurity to enterprise. It is evidently the interest of a Government to avoid all responsibility for commercial misfortuneo, even at the cost of disclaiming the merit of prcsperity, for in public as well as in private relations resentment is a more activo feeling than gratitude. On the other side, capitalists, however blind to their own interests, are superior in acuteness, and especially in singleness of purpose, to any Minister of State who might assume a control over their operations. A Government may be tempted to stimulate or to discountenance enterprise by motives altogether independent of the profits to be realized. Tho second Empire in France inherited from all its predecessors the assumed duty of regulating the commercial transactions of the country. The GBEAT NAPOLZON,r more especially, claimed the right of interfering in every department of human activity, but, among all the less manageable elements of society, none puzzled the irritated lion so frequently as the rebellious movements of the Stock-Exchange. He acquiesced, but unwiUingly, in the representations of DEcahs that his Admirals must necessarily take account of winds and of tides; but MoxnLm- and his other financial advisers could never make him understand that a " Bear" was not a political malcontent. The admiring historianof the Consulate andEmpireconstantlyrecords, with a hesitating protest, the impotent declarations of his hero, that he would bring " Messieurs les " Baissewrs' to their senses. NAPOLEON m. is a better economist, and if he has committed errors in encouraging or in restraining speculation, he is not incapable of profiting by experience. The loudest murmurs which have been uttered against bis administration proceed from a class of capitalists which at one time seemed to enjoy an unusual share of official favour. It was a mistake to foster a spirit of gambling; but it may be doubted whether the evil is remedied either by the refusal to concede new public works, or by the Imperial patronage awarded to heavy comedies against stockjobbing. Public opinion requires to be undeceived of the impression that credit depends on any support except that of integrity and of wealth. The Caisse G6nerale des Chemins de Fer is an institution organized by M. Mrks on the comnmandite principle in rivalry of M. PEzErm's Cr6dit Mobilier, and the shares of both undertakings have from similar causes suffered a heavy fall. Indeed, it would seem that no financial crisis was necessary to account for want of confidence in a company which, after investing a large portion of its funds in a Spanish loan, has employed a stil more considerable sum in purchasing the concession of the Roman railways. The PoPE and Queen IsAnELLA are not precisely the customers whom a prudent man would wish to find responsible for the principal part of his assets. Certain coal-pits in the South of France and gsa works at Marseilles would probably find more favour in the eyes of ordinary capitalists ; but, on the whole, public confidence has been shaken, and it became desirable that it should be re-established. For this purpose, and with the collateral object of insinuating charges against the Government, an ingenious little comedy was composed and exhibited at the recent meeting of the company. M. Mrnls, the founder and responsible Director of the Caisse Ge6nrale, commenced the performance by an elaborate exposition of his reasons for retiring from his post. A delicate personal susceptibility, an elevating enthusiasm for the honour of stockjobbiug, and a respectful disapprobation of the recent policy of the Government render the further progress of his scheme repugnant to his feelings. "Enterprise," he says, " has, like war, its honour "and its glory. The accomplishment of great "things in trade and finance is as noble aud at"tractive as in literature, in arts, and in politics." Of this ambition M. MmRhs is not ashamed: it is his aspiration to make grand ways of communication, to construct sanitary works in populous cities, to dig fuel from the bowels of the earth, to found manufacturing and mining establishments; " last "of all, to give to States and Governments the "financial assistance which provides them with the "Pinews of warand of peace, and which has elevated "finance to the level of a political science." London dealers in stocks and shares follow precisely the same occupation; but they are incapable of rising to so poetical and disinterested a view of their unconsciously sublime functions. A rise or fall of an eighth in the quotation of any stock would, we fear, interest the vulgar share-jobber more earnestly than the sublime reflection that he has seconded the beneficent operations of Nature. It seems that French society at present labours under a similar want of enthusiasm. " Wherever " you go," says M. Mraks in his flowing eloquence, " at the theatre, in drawing-rooms, in " books, on the bench, in the pulpit, at the Legis" lative Tribune, in town, in country," there prevails an almost unanimous hostility to business and men of business,-" ce qu' on appelle les affaires, " et les hommes qui les ford." The Bourse and its " stags" are profoundly unpopular. The reasons which have led to this general injustice can only be indicated with caution and delicacy. The public have misunderstood the preventive measures of the Government. The Minister announced that no new railway concessions would be granted, and an ignorant community has supposed that he wished to restrain speculation. The consequence is general alarm, a fall in existing shares, and an absence of further opportunities of profitable investment. The changes in the sharelist are, according to M. MiRts's cool aswertion, equivalent to the annihilation of several xillions' worth of property. At the same time, the benefactors of the human race who have invested their money in joint-stock companies are exposed to the most shamelems calumnies, and it is suggested that credit can only be restored by giving full protection to its representatives, or, in other words, by securing M. MiRks against criticism. "CnArFoxr has " remarked that MOLIkRB, who brought all other " classes of society on the stage, has spared " financiers; and he adds that COLBERT had "induced Louis XV. to prohibit him from "representing them." The inference is obvious, that M. FouLD falls far short of his famous predecessor. On these grounds 3I. M kRts tenders his resignation; but Count SimioN, in an equally elaborate speech, protests against his resolution, and at the unanimous desire of the meeting the menace is eventually withdrawn. The shareholders of the Caisse G6nerale can no longer blame their representative if their dividends gradually decline and their shares go down in the market. The Imperial Government must bear the responsibility of their losses, although it would seem that speculations in Spain and Italy were beyond the reach of administrative encroachment. It is not likely that the Exrmmop or his Ministers will extend the law of libel after the precedent of COLBERT. M. POXSARD, though he is not exactly MoLkRu, has been rewarded for dedicating his satire on the Bourse to the successor of Louis XIV. But if the oratory of M. Minks is somewhat turgid, his complaints are not altogether without foundation. It is true that the interference of the Government has lowered the valae of shares, which had in many cases been raised to a premium by the same machinery. Joint-stock proprietors have a ri,ght to complain of an artiaoial depreciation of values, Wa it i not mprsing that they attribute to administrative caprice the conEequencee of a voluntary and officious foredglt. The Cr6dit Mobilier and the Caisse G6mnrale may, after the experience of the past, safely be left to find their own leveL
Cardinal WismuiN is again our correspondont. He wants to know whether we still maintain our criticism upon his sermon of the 26th of July. We regret to say that we see no reason for altering it. And we must add that if anything could strengthen our convictions on the subject it would be the Cardinal's own defence of himself, which is, first, that, knowing of the Indian mauacres, he deplored them with a sufficient and adequate grief; secondly, that not knowing of them, he had a good excuse for an insufficient and inadequate demonstration of grief. It is sometimes useful to have two strngs to a bow, but care should be taken that they do not pull against each other. We wiU not, however, dwel on the discord of the Cardinal's two strings, but will take what is evidently the favourite one of the two, and see on what ground his plea of ignorance rests-4. e., that his sermon was preached before " any of the accounts " in detail of the atrocities," &c., had reached us. He insists particularly on the date of his sermon, and charges us with suppressing it. But what was the date of the sermon? The sermonwas preached on the 26th of July-that is, two days after the news of the massacres of Meerut, and five days after that of the massacres of Delhi, had arrived. It ix true that aU the details of these massacres were not then given,-indeed, they have not yet reached us,-but some very dreadful details had been published, and the slaughter was stated to have been general and indiscriminate, involving men, women, and children, and accompanied with the most atrocious insults to the women. It was after the arrival of this news that the Cardinal's principal comment upon the outrages in India, in a public discourse, was a taunt against England and Piedmont, and a comparison of Indian mutineers with our " friends," as he described them, the Neapolitan refugees. Oar remark upon this was that the preacher did not care a straw for the Indian outrages, but was simply intent on extracting an argument from them in favour of the King of NAEs; aud we maintain that this was natural and just criticism. We have no access to the secrets of the Cardinars breast, and cannot possibly judge of his fwelings except from his own expre-sion of them. If he really felt any deep and tender sympathy with English sufferings in India, this was a very odd way of showing it. His sermon has not done him justice in this respect, and the sooner he learns how to express his feelings more correctly the better. He will, at any rate, learn a lesson from our comments, and, on the next occasion on which he may desire to express his affection for the English, he will adopt another mode of doing so than that of extracting from a national afiction an impertinent taunt. It may be a mistake, but we are not accustomed to regard such a proceeding as a sign of affection or sympathy; and, this being the case, we could only make the comment we did upon the Cardinal's discourse. We were then, and we are now, commenting upon a public writing, and upon a public writing only. We know nothing about the individual as such, whether he is or is not humane, sympathetic, tender, or affectionate. We cannot pretend to carry on a dispute with the Cardinal respecting the state of his own feelings, and as he appears to be ready now to give, as the Quakers say, his "af9irmation" that he does feel trae, genuine, and indisputable grief for the sufferings of our countrymen and countrywomen in India, we are willing to admit the fact upon his assertion, but we must repeat that he has been most unfortunate in his mode of expressing himself. We earnestly advise him for the future, when he wants to show himself particularly sympathetic and to condole tenderly with us in our misfortunes, not to apply such a tortuous argumentative sneer to the subject as he applied on the late occasion. He may as well omit allusion to the King of NAPLEs,, for that is at any rate an irrelevant subject, and he may expose himself, as he has done now, to misconstruction. He cannot show his English feeling and patriotism by turning the misfortunes of England into a gratuitous charge against her and a defence of a foreign despotism. If he does he will infallibly provoke the same criticism that he has done now. He will be called, instead of a friend in need, a Jos'S comforter, and, instead of an Englishman, a foreigner.
LYCEUM THEATBE. The lEnglish version of 3eyerbeer's Huguenots brought forward several members of the company last night whose services had not been called into request on the previous evening. The " tragedy queen" was made evident in the Teutonic person of Madamo Caradori, whose sbstantial portrayal of Valentine is weU known to the British public. For Baoul de Nangis we had Mr. Augustus Brahaum, vwho, whatever elso may be said of his performances, can certainly not be charged with want of earnestness. In respect to " good intention," Mario himself might take a hint or two from this gentleman. Thus the prominent passages between the Catholic noblewoman and her Huguenot lover-and especially the famous duet after the benediction of the swords-were gone through with infinite spirit if not with Infinite refinement. The part of Margarite de Valois was intrusted to Miss Marlan Prescott, a novice, too nervous to render justice to whatever power she may possess, and vwhom we must take another opportunity of criticsing. That of Urbain was equally in untried hands. Madame CorreUi, its representative, would have done more wisely to confine herself to the one song originally nUotted to the Page. The air, " No, no, no," was composed by Meyerbeer expressly for Alboni, when the Hugzmenofs was given at the Royal Italian Opera, in 1848, and requires the voice and the f'uent execution of Alboni to make it effective. At prcsent it is beyond the reach of Madame Correlll, Another novice, Mr. Ferdinand Glover, appeared as the Count de Nevers, and though he by no means realized the ideal of that chivalrous aud confiding nobleman, being somewhatawkward in deportment, he afforded sufficient proof not only of being gifted with au agreeable barytone voice, but-which Is much rarer-of having acquired by dint of study the command of it. Of the little that Nevers has to sing in a conspicuous position Mr. Glover toek such advantage as at once to declare himself an artist and win the applause of the house. This was the worthier of being noted since the audience last night were rather chary of their approbation, their plaudits being most frequently elicited by those situations where the masses are brought into play, and the eficiency of orchestra, chorus, and subordinates beoomes an important consideration. The" Ratsplan" chorus (tenor solos by Mr. St Albyn), the finods to the se4ond aXi, and the grand scene of the conspircy, were the most remarkable instances in point A ihese, thanks to Mr. Alfred Mellon, were admirably executed. As the Count de St. Bris, Mr. Hamilton Braham showed himself a complete adept in the transitions belonging to that line of business professionally classified as "heavy fAther." lMr. Braham. however, though weighty, was not obtrusive; and many a singer might study with advantage his method of enuncating the words, than which nothing cm be more distinct. The plot of St.Brisand his companons for the mnascre of the Huguenots, through the medium of his intelligible declamation, was made clear to the oommonest apprehension. Mr. Weiss pl%led Marcel, and on the whole his perfermance, judgedfrom amusicalpointof view, was the best of the evening. Mr.Weiss is alwaysperfect in whatever he has to sng, and as usual his co-operation in the concerted pieces Was of the utmost value; but he exhibited unwonted spirit in the war song (" Piff-paff"), while the duet with Valentine in the Pre au Ctacs found him even more buay than his foreign companion herself in endeavouring to sustain the dramatic interest of the scene. Mr. Wallworth, as leader ol the night-watob, had to summon the Parisians to their homes, and, for the first time, the old strain of the couvrc fc was chanted in tunc-wvhich was so contrary to experience that the effect almost amounted to a disappoint. ment. Such is the force of babit. The opera is weU got up In every respect but we cannot help thinking that the success of the new undertaking shonild ce made to depend on works of v gucb ls os tly and elaborate description,

Mr. Hanna and his admiring diecid e have had another feld-day on sunday 1t but, without any thanks being due to them, the peace of the town ws preserved, and a sufficient police force and a general disinclination dn the part of the people for a Sanday brawl prevented a repe. tition oxthe disgraceful scene Which neceeotated the placing of Belfast under the supervision of some 2,000of Hier Majesty's troopsin addition to a large polioe force. The Belfast Mercury hAthe folloWi3g sketch of Mr. Hanna's Sabbath recreations:_ 2 Yesterdcay we were very nearly hawing a renewal of the disturbances which have taken place in this town for some time past, and we oongratulate the public on the a2rrow escape we have had. It wag stated that the Rev. Hugh Hania would again preach in the open air in the vicinity of the quays and this having reached the ears of the magistates the necessary arrangements were mnade by tbem. A' half-past 1 o'clock all the available police, constabulary and local, were mnarched to Done. gall quay, where they took up their position. The constabulary were under the comaund of Mr. Williams, County Inpector; and the lose force nnaer Messrs. Llzndy and Green. An immense number of people, men, women, and boys, were on the spot, and as the hour wore on, the number increased until it amounted to probably, 3,000 or 4,00u, scattered about in gr6ups. At o'cdock the Rev. ir. Harna attempted to prech in thewaste field near Prince's Dock. His congregation was large. Tho Mayor, Mr. Clarke, Mr. Tracy, and Mr. W. Verner. re!ns,ntrated with him, and warned him of the coa9- eqrinces that might arise if he persisted in preaching. Hte refused to oomply with their request, and told them he would assert his conmtitutional right. He was encouragod by his oongregation to go on, and while he waa proceeding the magistrates directed the police to clear the ground. This the pollce effected without using any violence. Mr. linna then made his way to an enclosed yard, belonging to Kr. George Danbar, and he was soon joined by anotber oongreftlon, whom he at onoe commenoed to addres upon the rights of British subjects and the duties of the mairates, e did not attempt to go on with any relgiotn aervice, but chiefly directed his harangue to the subject of magisterial intrferenoe that day with his right,, and as to the propriety of the people around him; .patizng and going quietly to their homes. While he was so proceedng the police wero pin ordered to disperse the people, who were at the time considerably excited, and they at once executed the order. There was no attempt on the part of the oroman Catholics to interrapt or at all interfere with Mr. Hanma; but If he had been allowed to go on without being stopped by the magistrates it is diTicult to say what might not have hagpened, as the assemblage was at that time much larger th an it has been tbero on any preoeding oocasion. The police marched in bodies along the quaas for upwards of an hour after, preo venting the people from collecting in numbers at any particular place, after which they prooceeded to their barracks. There was no rioting at all during the evening. We underatand that the magistrates in directing the thoronghfares to be cleared, were actingnunder the orders which they had recently received from Dnblin Castle. Ait 10 o'clo¢k a.m. Mr. Mtler preached at Donegall quay ta small number of persons who had assembled to hear hm In the evening at 5 o'clock he agin preached in Sandy-row." TE IRISH SEPoYs. The Freema's JoTurnal, the leading Roman Catholic organ in Ireland, administers the following creditable rebuke to that section of the Irish presx which has volunteered the advocacy of the atrocities perpetrated by the Sepoys. Cornmenting upon the petition adopted by the Chamber of Commerce at Calcutta the Freeman says- " Some vile enemy of the Irish people has attempted to getup a murder and rapine spirit In Ireland, and to stimulate a pro-Sepoy feeling by the issne of plards in the Eouthern districts, for the purpose of inducing the belief that in the more Catholic districts of the country the brutalities of Sepoys are regarded with sympathy, and their treatment of the Irish and English ladies approved, becanse their busbandsand fathers areassumedto be connected with the British arm. This infamous attempt to identify the people of IreI na d'th Sepoyism has met a prompt and effective rebuke from the Catholic town of Carrick-on-Suir, who indignantly repudiate the 'nefarious' attempt, and have opened a subseription list for the purpoee of detecting the emissary of Sepoylam who brought the vie placards we allude to to their towrn. The Irish people condemn most heartily the system of oppression and misrule practised by the East India Company, but they have no sympathy with the butchers at Cawnpore, and the barbarities which form the characteristic of the war waaged against women and children. Some of the best men in IndiaEnglish, Scotch, and Irish merchants at Calculta-have protested against the misrule practised in India; but wbile these men have the manliness to denounce the errors of the Government in the petition which we subjoin, and from the midst of the revolt to demand a free and constitutional Government for India under the sovereignty of our Queen they have the wisdom to discriminate between rationa liberty and rampant licentiousness; and, while fearlessly exposing the evils which led to this revolt, they as fearlessly take up arms aginst the system of indiscriminate murder which the Sepoys would inaugurate, and their Irish sym- pathisers would have their dupes, if they could get any, to - followv " 51ThrA RIOTS M LAIERICK. Accounts have reached Dublin of a seriez of disgraceful riots in the city of Limerick, which lasted during the evenings of Saturday and Sunday, the rioters being the recently embodied County of Limerick Regiment. The facts are these - " On Saturday night the MlWltiamen,when passing through Ceorge's-street to their barracks in Boherbuoy, offered insult to several persons, and behaved in a most ruffianly manner towards every respectable inhabitant they happened to meet. The locality of Boherbuoy vwas a seoDe of commotion during the night, and the interference of the constabulary to restore order was ineffectual, or only kindled a flame for redoubled disturbances. More than 100 of the militia entered barracks in a drunken state, and the presumption of the police to meddle with them was discussed in every room. Revenge they vwould have, and accordingly between S and 9 o'clock, a little before ' tattoo,' a formidable force, numbering above 100 men of the county militia, congregs.ted before the polioe station in Boherbuoy, and commenced stonethrowing at the constabulary, and demolished the windows. Immense crowds collected, and, in self-preservation, the police-party, consisting of only seven men, had to load and tarn out v ith fixed bayonets. The rioters continued to assail them, and f.ur policemen were knocked down. Intelligence having rachebd the head station of the constabulary, in Williamstreet, the available force was called to arms, and proet eded to the rescue of their comrades in Boherbuoy. The county inspector (Mr. Calder) and the sub-inspector (Mr. M'Leod commanded), and their presence at the scene of outrage had the effect of dispersing the militiamen." An inquiry respecting these riotous proceedings took place on Monday before the Limerick mngistrate3, who, after hearing evidence, directed their officer to communicate what had occurred to Colonel Stack, of the Provisional Battalion, and to Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson, of the County Militia.

TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIMES Sir,-?iy atbention hxs been called to the following pas. ae in your review of Tlek Life of George Stephenson, by Smiles;- " Extensive tumels had to be driven through unknown strAa, and one of these wa tho famous Ejsby tunnel, which was entailed on the projectors by the opposition of the inbabitants of Northampton." I am fully aware that the inhabitants of Northampton are charged with the folly of opposing what would have been of most essential benefit to the town-the pasing of the main lime of the London and Birmingham Railway through it ; but I think the resolution I enclose, which was passed at a public meeting held on the 2d of November, 1830, the Mdayor presiding, and which was attended by the principal inhabitants of the town, is a refutation of the long-received opinion, and will relieve the town of the stigma such an aburd opposition would have denerved. I have copied the resolution from the locLl joumal-the Northaml*ozMcMury -whlich IN- " That it is the opinion of this meeting that It is highly dwsble that such railway should approach as near to the town of Northampton as possible." This meeting and the resolution passed at it will, I think, satisfy your reviewer that he cannot account for the KIsby tnnel upon the theory which he has adopted- and the pubc must h convinced that thoere w some otier cause tan the one aigned why the London and Birmingham Railwray did not pa throughNorthampton. I am informed that in the plans originally deposited by thbecompany it never was contemplated coming nearer to tbe town than about a mile from the present line, and that the company was induced to adopt thlx line upon the promin of Government anpport, in return for the aocommodax tion it afforded to Weedon.

SECOND EDITION. 'THk TIMES-OFFVIcB, Wednoday monring, EXPRESS FROM PARIS: 'The following Is the letter of our Paris correOpondent, dated yesterday (Tuesday), 6 p.m.:- Official intelligence has been received of the aei:eptance by the Mexican Government of the proflered mcliation of England aud France in the quar,tel betwean Mexico and Spain. The conference for Athe settlQment of this matter is to be held in London. 'This wiU probably not be very pleasing to Spain, -which would fain have had it in Madrid. The capital ..f one of the mediating nations is manifestly the most -suitable place. It is not yet known who will be the Plenipotentiarles appointed, but it is presumed that Senor Lafragua will represent Mexico, he being 'Completely au courant of the affair, which he has iollowed froni the commencement. The whole per..Zonael of the Mexican Legation at Madrid is now in 1'aris. In the total absence of political news of importtnce, small facts and causcries from Chalons obtain -attention. The stay in camp of the Duke of Cam- 33ridge seems to give fresh animation to the proceedings of the Imperial Guard. The ramblers who daily return here from ChAlons tell us of fireworks, Illuminations, dances, and diversions of all kinds, -and particularly of balloon ascents by the brothers Godard, which seem a very favourite amusement 'with the troops. At 6, on the day of the Duke's -arrival, there was a great dinner at the Imperial M-ead-quarters, to which all the Generals were invited. The capital band of the Guides played durIng the meal. The table was laid for 50, and, from Its position, the Emperor and his guests could be seen at dinner by persons walking in the neigh- -bourhood. In the evening the Emperor and $he Duke went to the Grenadiers' theatre, and 'Were loudly cheered on entering. The piece3 3Rlayed were the Almoer of the Regiment, Titi le Taloheur, and a Pic-nic ocf Auvergnats. In 4he first-named vawleville there is a passage where ,the almoner, disguised as a soldier, sings a couplet 'to the effect that the Emperor takes the crowns of all the Kings of Europe and gives them to his *-Ooldiers. This was received with frantic hurras, so much so, says a paper, that the staff appeared rather embarrassed. The Duke of Cambridge seemed -greatly amused by the performance. At its close, the Grenadiers, with torches, escorted the Imperial and Royal visitors to their quarters. The first performance of the Arab wedding by the Zouaves was to successf al that a second has been given on a larger scale, including various episodes of Arab life -under canvas. Yesterday the whole of the troops made a movement in the direction of the Suippe, a river whichflowsalong the northernlimit of the camp, 'where they were to bivouac two nights. The soldiers have their temts cZ'ab-i; it is not mentioned how the officers will manage, but the movement is considered as rather a bore. It was rumoured at ChiNIons yesterday that the duration of the camp would be prolonged to the 20th October, but I hear nothing of the kind stated here, nor is it probable. There is a talk of extending the Camp Branch Railway, which runs (with considerable deviations from a straight line) nearly due north, from ChAlons to Verdun, and thence to Metz. The ground for the line from ChW. Ions to the camp was got from its numerous owners on the following terms-they were paid for what- ever crops were growing on lt, and were also allowed to remove them, and were guaranteed -eventual satisfactory payment. There was no time for &any more exact and final arrangement. The Es:mperor is very popular in Champagne, and the peasants and other proprietors made no difficulty in complying with these terms, which in fact are very * advantageous for them. The Emperor's return to the camp, after his visit to Stuttgard, is considered certain, but it can hardly -take place until the 30th, so that it is presumable he will remain there but a short time. He leaves Stuttgard on the morning of the 28th, and makes a pause at Metz. General Reibell, who commands the military division of which Strasburg is the headquarters, has been at the camp to take the orders of the Minister of War with respect to the Emperor's journey. Marshal Ran don, who since his arrival from Algeria has been at his estate in the department of the Isere, has arrived in Paris, and will go to the camp on the Emperor's r euru thither , Letters from Vienna say that there Will he grand cavalry m aaicuvres at the Camip of Parendorf on the 2.5th, 26th, and 27th inst., the Emperor of Austria commanding. A number of persons, of distinction, including the diplomatic corps, have been invited. M. de Bourqueney, having communicated "Witll his Government on the subject, has been authorized to accept the invitation. Mlanin, the ex-President of the V onetiti Re.Public, one of the most prOminent and respectable - of recent revolutionary leaders, and celebrated for hsis gallant defence against the Austrians, died here this morning of disease of the heart. They write from Biarritz that the Empress, who 'has been making various excursions and apparently * enjoying herself much, might he expected to leave .:for Paris between the 25th and thle end of, the mraonlth. Her sister, the Duchess of Alla, and the Duke, now at Biarrltz, would accompany her. It ,was the Dake and Duchess of Medina Cell, not of Albai, WhO arrived here yesterday. M. Abbatucci would have presided in the Counaci of Ministers in right of seniority, had not King Jerome been appointed to do so. The latter, who * arrived in Paris last night from Havre, is going, it Is said, to stay at Meudon, but will come to Paris to attend the meetings of the Council, insteed of the :Mlinisters going to him, as they do to St. Cloud when thte Emperor is staying there. Monday bringing no English papers with letters and articles on Indian affairs for comment or reply, to-day's Paris journals find little to write about, and few of themn contain leading articles. The Cm nstitztionnet takes rather a brighter view of the Indian - question than has been its custom of late, in an article of which I subjoin an extract et: " Great faults have doubtless been commnitted in the ad. 4nitkistration of India, and an amount of egotism, or at le ast of hee dees,ness, has been tolerated which has led to despot. dsAm.

The Austrians affirm that Prince Vogorides i3 now as much in favour of the union of the two Principalities as he was formerly opposed to it; but the truth of the matter is, that, in obedience to orders received from the Porte, he remained passive while the elections were going on. According to a tolographic despatch received by one of the Vienna papers from Jassy, there wil be a small "antiunion"' majority in the Divan ad hoc, but in official circles it is well known that the Moldavian Unionists have obtained a victory over their oppenenta. Since the Conference at Osborne less importance has here been attached to the question of the organization of the Danubian Principalities, because it has transpired that the French Government has promised not to insist on their " personal union." The meaning of the diplomatic phrase quoted is that Moldavia and Wallachia are not to be united under one Hospodar or Prince. They may, ant probably will, have exactly the same institutions, but there will be two separate administrations. The correctness of the foregoing will, doubtless, be questioned by the French press, but the sequel wiU show that you have not been misinformed. Groat secre3y is here observed in regard to the proposed interview between the Emperors of Austria and Russia, but information has to-day reached me that they are to sleet at the beginning of the next month. Some time since the Ermperor Alexander expressed himself to the effect that he should be happy to see his brother Sovereign, and there is good reason for believing that the Emperor Francis Joseph wiU be at Berlin when the Czar passes through that city on his way back to Warsaw. On or about the 29th inst. the Austrian Monarch will go to see the ex-Emperor Ferdinand at Prague, and thence to the Prussian capital, where he will renain two or three days. There is no positive evidence that Austria is about to take up another position, but various circumstances induce me to believe that she wiU soon be on much more intimate terms with Russia and Prussia than she is at present. Count Buol's opponents are in very high spirits just now, as they fancy he will be obliged to quit office if there should be a reconciliation between the Courts of Austria and Russia. As you have repeatedly been informed, the Austrians sincerely hope that the mutiny in India may speedily be quelled; but they begin to talkof the " awkward position " in which England is placed, and to remark that for some time to come she will be so much occupied with internal matters that she will be able to pay less attention than usual to the affairs of Europe. In a word, Austria Is of opinion that for the moment England can be of little use to her as an ally, and she is, therefore, tho more inclined to place herself on a friendly footing with Russia. Some of the foregoing remarks will give little satisfaction either here or in England, bat the moment is a very critical one, aud it is well that you should know exactly how things stand. The punishment inflicted on Major Count lhunyady has produced a favourable impression, as the public had long fancied that a citizen had no chance of obtaining satisfaction if the person who wronged him wore a uniform. Military men profess to know little or nothing of what took place a' Ehiitteldorf, but I have acquired some further information on the subject at a reliable source. The regiment of hussars in which Count Hunyady was Major marched from Bohemia to the camp at Parendorf, and committed excesses at several places on the road. A General of cavalry is said to have called the corporeal punishnment inflicted on the Mayor of Hiitteldorf "a bad joke," but it would appear that the Emperor viewed the affair in a much more serious light, for he gave the strictest orders that no favour should be shown to the offender. The sentence passed on Count Hunyady by the court martial was four and not two years' imprisonment. The colonel of the regiment sent into the Military Central Chancellery of the Emperor a defence of the conduct of his subordinate, and was sent to the provost for four days for his pains. The officers wlho were present at the manceuvre at Parendorf the day before yesterday relate that a circumstance took place which mueh amused the Emperor and his suvite. A Hanoverian General was addressed by an Austrian General, who expressed his pleasure to see so distinguished a man as General Halkett-I believe that such is his name-in the camp. The Hanoverian was well pleased with the compliment and asked his interlocutor his name. "'I am thelEmperor" was the reply. Sir Hamilton Seymour Is said to have informed Count Buol that the British Government is about to issue a circular note on the subject of the Island of Perini. England denies that the Porte has any claim to the island, and is resolved to maintain possession of it. A Vienna correspondent of the Pesth LIoid states that it is a matter of indifference to Austria whether Perim remains in the hands of Hngland or not, and the same language has been used to me. According to tables which have been drawn up by order of the Minister of the Interior the indemnification for loss of villenage and soccage which the State has to pay to the proprietors in the German Provinces of Austria is 307,100,810fl. The Indemnification for the Hungarian, Croatian, Sclavonian, and Transylvanian landed proprietors is 243,00000fl. The total sum for which indemnification.bonds has been issued is 5SO,000,000fl., or 55,000,0001. It is definitively settled that the coin known as a " kreutzer" is entirely to disappear from the circulation. The hundredth part of the currency-union florin will be called II deute," and silver coins of the value of 25, 15. 10, and 6 deutes are to be minted. The largest copper coin Uwil be worth two deutes, and the smallest half a deute. A trustworthy person, who saw the reception given to the Pope in more than one of the large towns in the Romagna, assures me that the semiofficial accounts of the enthusiasm of the people were totally incorrect. The public either was, or appeared to be, totaUy indifferent. " The chargea of mal-administration which have been brought against the Papal Government are perfectly well founded, and the country can never be at peace until reforms are made." Such is the language of an extremely intelligent and conservative Austrlan. The Constantinople correspondent of the Trisikr Zeitung writes that many " Indian veszels" have been lost in the Red Sea. According to advices from Teheran of the 15th 'of AlugUst, Murat Mirza, the Couma ler-in-Chief of the Per- kiln army in K; orawnana,> asaembled hiW army iL: R,pye-about1>three anlleg from rlatat, whero he &t_f orders to evanasto the prbHince I but on tFbdin; news of a-confllot ften-tbhilit andi Sunmiitd hq returned to Horat to ftote 02der.

There being no subject of greater public interest on tho tapis at the moment, I went up the Val d'Aost the other day to examine the sceno of the inundation which I mentioned in my Iass letter. Arnaz, the village that has suffered ed terribly, is abont 15 English miles from Ivrea, and one beyond the Fort of Bard. The valley there widens into a triangular-shaped basin, at the upper angle of which is the village of Arnaz, with the towns of Bard and Champ de Praz at either extremity of tho bass, alOng which runn the Dora Baltea. At the baek of .raz there is a sugar-loaf shaped hill, the steep sides of which are scored with water-coses, mnaking a fan-like figure, converging to a point just above the village, where their united contributions form the torrent that has caused all this present maisery. Heretofore this torrent has been considered so insignificant and so lnnocuous that it has never been thought worthy of any more special designation than the "little stream" or the "little torrent ;" indeed in ordinary times it barely iufficed to turn the viUage mill and supply the irrigation of the fields below, all which it has so utterly destroyed in its fury. According to the accounts of the villagers the disaster is attributable to a violent storm with very heavy rain, which some call a waterspout, bursting on the sugar-loaf hill above mentioned, on the night of the IOth inst., and it is supposed, from the masses of rocks brought down from the ddes of the hill, that some obstruction was caused a short waY below the junction of the water-courses, and which must have formed a dam. until such a. body of water was collected behind it as burst through all opposition and destroyed everything that stood in its passage. Looking at the great iragments torn from the mountain, and now scattered over what were carefully cultivated vineyards and meadows, this surmise appears reasonable enough, but to obtain anything like a clear description of subsequent events until the work of desolation was at an end, was, of course, out of the question, for, in the first place, it must have been pitch dark when the casualty occurred; and, in the next, the wretched survivors, whom we met wandering about the ruins, looked as if they must have been completely bewildered, beyond all hope of understand;ng, by such an untoward eatastrophe. As may be supposed, the scene presented to the eye there is melancholy in the extreme, and is rendered more disagreeably so by the numbers of persons afflicted, moreor less, with the curseof goitres and cretinism. A shipwreck, an earthquake, a field of battle, miglht furnish similes for this sight of desolation. Mill wheels, cart wheels, window frames, doorposts, beams, wine barrels, bits of furniture, &c., lie scattered all about among rocks fresh from the mountain side and bricks and atones from the overthrown houses, but the effects of this inundation more nearly resemble the overflow of a volcano than auything else, perhaps, for t'he whole valley from the village of Arnaz down to the Dora, for the breadth of a couple of hundred paces on an average, has been overlaid with a coating of gravel and rock, and of course all vegetation destroyed as e:fectually as on the sides of Etna or Vesuvius when a stream of lava runs down them. The vineyards, and meadows,and corn fields,which the poor villagers cultivated with painful labour, are now no more, and the space they occupied resembles merely the bed of a torrent. It must be some years before this land can be recovered from the destructive matter that now overlays it, for the people of the district are poor, and have been great sufferers by the vine disease, and it is calcula'ted that the damage done now is equal to 500,OOOf. The loss of human lives has been 30, as isncertained by the authorities up to this time, but it is feared that still more have been sacrificed, of which there is no proof as yet. One whole family was swept away, and not a single member left to tell the tale. One of those rescued alive from the ruins died the day before yesterday, and there are many others in a precarious state from wounds and exposure. The body of a young woman was found on the banks of the Dora, near Ivrea, the other day. The face was so little disfigured that she was immediately recognized by her brother, who had been summoned for the purpose by the magistrates. It appears that at the time of the disaster she was in the house with her father and mother and an invalid sister. The fathez and mother were wash ed away to a considerable distance, but left ultimately ou dry ground without any very serious injury, but the fate of the other daughter is still uncertain. The villagers were still digging to clear the callars of a house, three walls of which alone remained standing, when I visited the place the other day, in search of the bodies of persons who it was thought might have rushed there for security; aud as we passed the church we saw another party engaged in digging a fosselike looking grave. Altogether a more dis.piriting sight than this unfortunate village offered can hardly be conceived, heightened as it is by the presence of that most hideous af4liction, cretinism, which is sure to present itself a- every turn. It is gratifying to find that not only the King ancd the Government have contributed handsomely towards the relief, as far as possible, of the sufferers, but that all the neighbouring commune3, as well as the municipalities of Aosta and Ivrea, have voted liberally for the same object, and private charity is also adding considerably to the fund. SPAIN. The Madrid journals of the 17th say, that notwithstanding the cessation of the MTinisterial crisis, it was rumoured that General Figueras was about to resign the Ministry of War, and be replaced by General Lersundi; also that several high Iunctionaries of the Palace, and among them the Duke de Baylen and Gerieral San Miguel, were about to be dismissed. The Queen had given a grand banquet to the Prince of Orange, which was attended by the diplomatic body, the Ministers, and a number of distinguished personages. At Barcelona a man had been arrested for posting up seditious placards.

I Tin ADVANO.I .P 7.ODv T4e followlng letter is from a lad of 18 -who had hined the Vbluuteer Cavalry upon the mutiny of pt OWnt regiment :-- " Camp Nswabguigo, :R Oanpore, July 2L 'I have not written since Allaft$Nd, but I hope you will 1cgve me then you hear hopr actively Se hvoa been en. gageL I began by joining the Volunteetf aTzlry, whICh was being raised from officers without regimentF, and tent l Into camp immediately and wras nearly washed away by | rain. On Tuesday, the 7th, we marched out at 4 p.mi., It still raining, and the Volunteer Cavalry leading the way, We had also 1,500 Europeans, eight guns, and a few Sikhs anda some Irregular Cavalry. That night we were very uncomfo,-tble, boing encarapei in a marsb, no 'food to eat, and the >Dents not coming up till aftei dark. On Saturday we- encamped within a few miles of the column that had gone beforo, and which joined with us next day at I vm.; 6 a.m. found us. after au 18 milee march close to Fattehpore, where there was known to be an intrenched camp in the enemy's possession. We, mustering 20in all, a few of the Irregulars, and a company of Fasleers, were pushed forward, aud-approajiiedtowards the plae. Tytler, our QuartermutetGenerai went close up, and was taking a good survoy of the plaoewhea ths whole force rashed out on him; he galloped bac to us, and we stood itili there tiUl the guns opened on us with round shot, and-their cavalry skirmished on our flanks. The Irregulars tried to bolt, but were stopped by the Madras Faaileers. We then al retired slowly on our camp, the enemy following. When we had formed up our artillery advanced and opened on them, but nDthing more, as they bolted immediately, their cavalry leading the way. They left 11 guns in all, a great deal of baggage, but no treasure. We learnt afterwards that thoy had come out supposing us to be Major Renaud's coinmn, with two guns only, and they had come with their baggage, intending to cut up Miaor .,lnd`uds party, tnd then go straight on to Allahabed. We ;nirehed through the town and got to our encamping ground at 3 ouelock in the afternoon, having been marching and fighting siue l o'clock the night before. We had not a man killed, though several poor fellows fell victims to sun strokes. We, of course, halted alU next day, but hid to di3. arm the Irregulars, as they had bolted and deserted their officers the day before, whea called upon to charge the rebels. We fought on Sanday, halted on the Monday, and on Tues. day again came across the enemy, intrenched ; we immediately drove them out, and they left behind two guns; we rested an hour, though I personally had no rest, being sent back to see if the baggage wvas all right, it having been aitacked by tho enemy's cavalry, though without success. On my joinig our men again we got the order to advance, which we did for about three miles, when they openea on us a 24-pounder intranched on the other side of a smaU stream, they havlng withdrawn all their men across the bridge. We blow them out of that again, and crossed the bridge just in time to save Its being blown up, as they had laid a train so to do. This second time we took a 24-pounder and one 16-pound carronade. The men were so done up that we had to halt them, and not before time, as the sun was overpowering. The next day was an awful day for us Volunteer Cavalry; we marched early and went about 16 miles, or within three of where the enemy were strongly intrenched, and we had therefore to go on picket, I myself standing sentry for an hour, and from the beginning to end we were on the qui virse all the time, as the Sowars were hanging around us. I had been on picket all night, and had had nothing to eat except biscuit, nor anything to arink but water. We managed to get a lIltle meat in the middle of the day, but had to eat it standing. At 3 o'clock we advanced again, and marched on to somne little distance, when the column turnedoffto theright, the Volunteer CavalryremainIng on the road so as to hide the movement, and then we formed up in the rear. We were fired on immediately, and after some difficulty carried their position on the Cawnpore road, where the infantry and cavalry were in fuU retreat, and then we 20 Volanteer Cavalry made a gallant charge, loslng one man killed, though it is a miracle that we werenot all shot as they coolly potted at us. A pretty sharp baptism all this for a yoingster ! We then took breath on the Delhi road, but a round shot from the vilage on the right soon knocked'as up again; the village was carried at the point of the bayonet, bat no sooner there than two 24-pounders opened again furtherdowntheCawnpore road and out of tho range of our guns, which were on thae Delhi road, but these were ultL matelycapturedbynu. Wegotonourencampinggroundjustas it was getting dark, after having again c.aptured seven guns, among them the two 21-ponnders Oar baggage had not moved since the halt, and was therefore about' seven miles behind. We had nothing for it but to go supperless to bed, holding our horses, as no grooms were up. As luck would have it, I had to mount night guard from 9 to 11, and had no sooner turnedin than a false alarmwas given, and we were aU roused up again, but only for a quarter of an hour. When I turned in with a looted Sepoy's cloak around me, and a bottle for my pillow, I slept like a top. Next morning we heard an explosion, irhichturned out to behalf the magazine which they had blown up. We then marched into the cantonments, and I had the satisfaction of putting up in the 2d Cavalry lines. A nlgger brought lots of beer, sodawater, and brandy, which was a great haul, as we had only had a biscuit for breakfast. We found the next day that the Nena had murdered aU the women and chUdren that he had taken prisoners, and thrown them naked down a weUl This he did when he saw we were getting the best of it. The women and children, in aU about 200, had been kept in a sort of Zenana, and no attention whatever paid to cleanliness, and in that place they had been batchered, as the groundvwas covered with clotted blood. One poor woman bad evidently been working, as a Pmai workbox was open and the things scattered about; there were several children's Snall round hats, evidently showing that that was their prison, and the well close by was one of the most awful Bights imaginable. It has been covered in, and I hope that we shall raise a monument over it. The Nena has escaped us for the time, but hewill assuredly be hnng some day, unless the report is true that he has drowned himself. The day before yesterday being Sunday church parade was omdered, but instead of this we were marched off to Bithoor, where the Rajahbs palace was. We found it quite deserted of men, though they had kindly left us 15 more guns, bulocks, elephants, &c. Their guns were in strong position, but they seem to have been seized with a panic and bolted. The villagers are bringing in Sepoys daily, and seem very glad to have us back again. The latest ac counts from Lucknow are good, though Sir H. Lawrence is dead; but Major Banks, now in command there, says he can hold out tillthe end of August. We had a general order yesterday, in which we were told that we had only commenced our work, as we had to relieve Lucknow, take Delhi, and march on to Agra. I only hope we may, and then we sball be sure of a medal, I am pretty comfortable just now, having a tent with another man, and am keeping my health wonderfully, and hope to do so till all the row is over. The latest report is that we are to make a dust at Lucknow without any baggage, rescue the people there, and rush back. Pleasant, won't it be, to have no covering in the rains ? We march for Lucknow in an hour, so good bye." THE DISASTER AT ARRA611. The following is a copy of a letter from one of the little band who defended themselves so gallantly at Arrah:- "Arrah, August 3, 10.30 am. I received your letter this morning just after a couple of men came in to tell us relief was at hand. Yesterday the troops had an engagement with the enemy, some 2,000 in number, and beat them back in charging. On Tuesday night we expeoted relief from Dinspore, as we heard heavy fing, but our men got caught among some topes* and were so mauled that they had to retire. "They had no guns with them. We have kept this house with 46 Sikhs-splendid fellows, and 15 }uropeans and half-etes; not a man on our side killed, and only one wounded dangerously, notwithstanding the enemy brought small guns against us; we were very nearly undermined, bat we ran a oounter one. Thank God, for sending us well amd in safety out of this, for I n ever expected to leave the house alive. We must have killed and wounded more than 50 of the enemy. "They expeted to starve us I fanoy, but we have enough for another four or five days, having got in a sortie some sheep, and we dug a well inside. I write in an awful state of dirt and confusoio, as the Goralogt are expected every minute. "1 P.S.-Of course we have nothing left in the world ; but we must not mind as we have our lives" DINAPOP.E. The following letter is from a lady " Boat off Dintpora, July 23. r3Iy own dear Parents,-Little l thought it would bave come to this, bad as the times are; however, I thank God, which I do most sincerely, that I have no worse news -we have escaped, and aro as well as we can hope to be under these most trying circumstanoes.

Oat of all the houses bnd immense works and materials collected for the bridge not a stick is left. What the Sepoys could not take or lestroy the villagers made up for. "We had no time to get the treasury from Knockar. house, and it of course is gone. It is a sad thing, tho work 3f years, and property to an enormous extent. All our European inspectors escaped, mostly without a single thing mave what was on their backs, except one, a fine young man . poor fellow he was butchered-was too late to get Into the boats. It is feared many between us and ArrahL are lone. As for Arralk, we are in great alarm about it. Some of the up-country engineers and civil servants fled to a small bungalow they had fortified. Arrala ve know is in fuU possession of the rebels. The prisoners ere set loose, and they are destroying everything. But the rate of the poor people we cannot tell. There has been no 2ews since 5 in the evening of the 26th. It they stand out iome six or eight against 2,000 or 3,000 Sepoys, it will be by a miracle. Poor Mr B-. is here in a fearfl state f mind, as you may imagine. Our friends the I-'s, by ;ome great good fortune, came here a few days lbefore for :hange of a>, Their house and all they possessed are lost; sad they remained nothing could have saved them. For ;everal up the line we are in great alarm. Lots of troops iave followed for places beyond Arrah. They say, 'Oh, trrah is gone by this; no nse our going there.' " lb is a sad thing that human lives and property should )a left in charge of such generals. Oar own unfortunate iogition prevents my letting you know of that of many >thers. But sinco there have been dreadful acoounts from ap-country; official reports of engineers' deaths-wives and II, in some cases. The country is in a fearful state all over, ?atna is expected to go next. What we shall do or where so go to I know not; the steamers going down are too full f up-country refugees to leave room for us. Dinapore is so ull tbat for any amount we coudd not get a siDgle room. Fe have no help hut to live as we have been doing, which s, I must confess, very wretched-five of us in an open >oat5 with a thatched bamboo chopper over part of it to cop off the sum.

The Company with their own losses, perhaps, cannot do it. " The P's are going down to Calcatta and home.

JUBBIJLPORE. The following is from an officer "Jubbulpore, Augast 5. "M My last, I fear, would have made you all somewhat anxious about us. I am happy to say we are all quite well, and I trust we have now little or no danger to apprehend. I mentioned that a forcs had left Kamptee for this place. It arrived two days ago-aix guns, with 75 European artillery. men, a squadron of the 4th Native Cavalry, and the 33d Regiment of Madras Native Infantry; but, to the dismay of those who remain here, the commissioner has decided, in the meantime, to take the whole of this force out into tho district to quell some refractory petty chiefs. I say in the meantime, for I am in hopes the commissioner will yet think better of it, and not venture to leave this most import. ant post to the tender mercies of the 52d Regiment. If he persist In taking the whole force with him, I conceive our podtion here will be more precarious than it was before the column Arrived. If two guns were left with us I think we we could hold our own, even if the 52d did go. The movement of the whole force has been strengly protested against, and Erskine has been requested to halt the column pending the decision of the Governor-General. We were fondly hoplng that all mutinies were at an end, but the lat four days has brought us intelligence of the mutiny of ei regiments. At Begowlee the 12th Irregular Cavalry mutinled. They shot their oommanding officer, his Wife, and child,and burntalive theirdotor,with hs wife and child, In their own bungalow. At Futtyghur the wife and child of Mr. Tucker, being about to fall into the hands of another robellious set, she called to her husband:to shoother at once, He did so, his child also, and then himsel A Major Robertson has also shot his wife and chfidren and himself, under similar croumstanocs. Tbh is anew aL d melancholy feature in the tragedies, All this having ooured withln the last few days makes us the more anxdous about being left kee -nprotected. The officers of the 521 naturally uphold their own regiment; but as now there are srodel 10 regiments remaining of the Bengal army it is very probable th4t the 62d wil go sooner or later. It is most inscrUtable. A regiment appears stanch up to tho hour it mutluies, everything going on as usual up to the very hour of tho outbreak.YouwillgetaccounU of lavelockesdifferent successful engagements in his advance to Cawupere in the newspapers, but they may not mention a wonderful piece of luck for us in one of them.

"1 My dear Sir, -The very painful duty has falltn upon meof acquainting you with the loss you have sustained by ther death of your most gallant soD, from a mortal'woundreceived in action before Delhi on the 9th inst. I cannot express toyou the sorrow this has caused to me and to everyone in tbe' regiment. None have felt more than I, for I had formed, great hopes of him; he had every quality to make a goaffi soldier-bravery, coolness, ready will, and ready obedience, and never were those qualities more conspicuous than in the engagement which was his first and last. We went into, action about u a.m., and the duty which we had to perform was to clear the mutineers out of an intricate labyrinth of gardens and houses. This was done with great rapidity but not without considerable loss, as the mutineerstook advantage of every wall and building, and we lost 30 men. kiled and wounded, out of 160 we had in action. I saw your brave boy head the men of his company in a dozen charges, and his light foot let no man head him, and throughout he wsS unhurt. We had driven the mutineers out of the gardens across the road, which we crossed, and going up the bank of a canal we entered an enclosure, round which the mutineers had mustered in force, and a, shot from a loophole struck him in the abdomen, passing out just above theogroin. IHe is buried in the cemetery. When this business is over we shall erect a tomb tohic memory. He wras sensible to the list, and died like a trueChristian, without repining.

CARDINAL WIEBMAN UPON INDIA. Cardinal WiEeman regrets being obliged once more to trouMle the Editor of The Times in reference to the article in his paper of the 14th inst. In his note from York, for the insertion of which in The Times of the 18th the Cardinal begs to thank the Editor, he abstained from making any remarks on the execrable character attributed to him in the article referred to, and contented himself with pointing out the omission, it was hoped accidental, of the date of his sermon, a date which, if stated, would have entirely altered the case propounded to the readers of The Tinmes. He left it to the Editor himself to discharge the honourable and gracious duty of tendering apology or making reparation for having made an ungrounded imputation of a very serious character, a duty from which neitber the Christian nor the gentleman can ever shrink. Having waited for the appearance of two numbers, in which no further notice is taken of the matter. the Cardinal has no alternative but respectfully to inquire from the Editor wbether it is his intention to withdraw his accusation of the Cardinal's "not caring a straw for the outrages, the horrors, the inmsults, and the atrocities of the Ixndian mnutinies," or whether he intends himn to be held up to England, to Europe, and to India itself, where there are many in whose fate he is deeply and personally interested, as the one exception in this country to the ordinary feelings of humanity. 8, York-place, Sept. 21.

In. 1849 sevoral Inhabitants asked permission of the mayor to invite a Protestant clergyman to expound to them his doctrlnes-nob. that they were Protestants, but that they might decide on. their future conduct. The mayor, like a prudent man, advied the petitioners to reflect wll on thoir_equesth; hedidc notwiibtorefusethemthepracticeof aright, bat. he, atL the same time, wished to avoid the reproach of having: advised themn to act with zash haste.

.'HE SOUTHRY ST XTEAS OF AMBRBCA. (FRoM OUR SPFCTAL COREZ8POWDENT-1 NEW ORLEANS, AUG. 26. One of the changes consequent on the extension of railroads in America is that the rivers lose much of their importance as routes of travel; formerly they were the beet, sometimes the only, highways, egpecially in the newer settlements of the West. But they are being rapidly superseded, and in a few years the chief business on the rivers will be the conveyance of mere dead freight and floating timber ra. Wherever a railway is run parallel to a navigable stream the passenger traffic Is diminished or entirely diverted from the latter. Though for the traveller the balance of oomfort ia In favour of the steamer, the river boata having been perfected in all their arrangements to the point of luxury, yet their +t miles an hour cannot compete with the 25 of the train. The last is also superior in other respects; on the railroad there is more certainty of arrival and departure, the iron way being exempt from various caprices to which those who voyage on the inland waters of the contineat must submit. The river,,. with many valuable qualities, have some drawbacks ;-they wre vable in the depth of water from week to week, often almost from day to day, and abound in sanibanks and shoals and sudden turns, among which the floating palace to which the traveller has committod himself grounds or sticks fast, with a greater or lems possibility of getting off again. This in an inconvenience for which gilding, carpets, mirrors, and chandeliers do not fully compensate, nor is the good table generally kept on board more than au alleviation of the disaster. The difficltty is most incident to the smaller rivers, and the tributaries and branches of the great ones. On the Lower Mississippi, for inatance, there is less danger of a three days' voyage being extended over ten, aud on the higher steams, by laying up the large boats in the smmer and shifting into others of lighter draught, the conumunication (as advertised) is kept open. But, in point of fact (which is not advertised), lf the boat is waiting for freight, or for a rise in the river, or is caught as aforesad by a sudden fall thereof, elemeuts of uncertainty are introduced into this mode of oonveyance which go far to neutralize its many advantage. The oonsequence is that whenever s place can be reached by railway the river boats, with all their seductions of comfort and mzgnifince, are aided, or have to compete with the raiwy by redwing their fares. In this manner the giory of the laudson river boats appesxs to have departLd, though, the voyage being short, they are leo affecd by their rival thsn on other rivers ofthe north and s. it is In the South'the ch3nge has been the geaest Of the Potomsc only asection is now u!ed in sb_ servience to a raflway; the Savannah is abandonedj by travellers altogether; the same fate imponds over the James. And when certain lines, of road are completed even the mighty waters of the Lower Mississippi are threatened with a competition that will reduce them to the second route of travel throughout a region in which they have hitherto been the first. The change comes slow,ly, but surely; every link supplied in the great chain of railway communication between South and North brings it nearer. The river Alsbama, the chief and central stream of the State of that name, is now, and wiU be for some time to come, part of tho great lne of travel between New York and New Orleans, but as the route for passengers its days are numbered; the railroad southward, that will draw off the living portion of the traffic is now in progress. At pregent passenger are gathered by several roulea frorm the north and eaat, ._. Auguata, Macon, Columbus, and other points, to a centre at Montgomery, on the upper part of the Alabanma, whence they descend that river about 400 miles to Mobile, on the Gulf of Mexico. The railway is creeping up from Mobile to Montgomery, and when in operation it will offer such an economy of time, and so much more certainty of movement, that the superior accommodations of the steamer 'will be placarded in vain. They are really excellent, and once afloat the river voyage is very pleasant; the country is thinly peopled, the river banks are forest for hundreds of miles, and the traces of human habitation very rare; but the steamer is independent of supplies, and glides smoothly through the wilderness by day and night. It is as if a section of a first-rate hotel detached itself from the wharf at starting, complete in all the appliances of life, and floated you down to your destination, however distant. The living during the transit is rather better than on Shore, at little more than the same cost, so that the margin left to pay for the locomotion is very moderate indeed. The Alabama would be considered a large river in Europe, as it is navigable by steamers for nearly 500 miles from its mouth, or from Mobile to a point northward of Montgomery where two inland streams, the Coosa and the Tallapoosa, unite, thence southward, forming the Alabama. But on this continent, where it compares with watercourses or "systems" measured by thousands of miles, it is only a river of the fourth class-in fact, a rivulet. Till it descends into the rich level bordering the Gulf of Mexico part of the immense delta of the Mississippi, which extends northwards about 100 miles above Mobile, the Alabama flows through the hilly region of the State. The outlines of the country are softly rounded, the heights clothed with forest, and the valleys filled in, almost filled up, with a dense and luxuriant vegetation, to which the giant creepers and the fan-leafed palmetto give a half tropical character. Where nothing else can find space to root or twine itself the eternal Spanish moss hangs its long tufts to the branches, a gray, shaggy, withered growth, the form of vegetable life that always appears dead and in decay. The river threads the windings of hundreds of these valleys, in which the forest descends to the water's edge, the trees almost brushing the steamer's sides as she passes; -where the stream has cut its way through a ridge it leaves low cliffs of sandstone on each hand, Sometimes the bed of the river appears entirely blocked by a sandbanl; stretching across it, the channel being invisible, till a sudden curve of the stream proves it to be only an island, and it is passed; not always safely, however, for on some of these banks and shoals reposes the skeleton wreck of 'what was once a goodly steamer; the machinery and the u pPer works have been rescued . and are, perhaps, navigating the river still, but the keel-and ribs, fragments of the lower deck planking, and remnants of paadleboxes tell the tae of stranding and abandonment plainly enough. They rot p iec meal, til the relic is reduced to what can be washed away by a strong winter flood and dlsappea ra In the meantime the bolts and timbers make convenient Perches for the waterfowl These wrecks increaa3 in number in descending the river, and become & feature of the scenery. As On most of the Southern rivers, the absence of life on the Alabaaa is remarkable. There is not a boat moving on its surfac; a few rougrh Punts fastened here and there t o a tree, and apparently used for fishing, with, at long intervals, some ferries, form all the river craft proper that are to be seen. And, except at the point, at wrhich the steamer stops to take in or land freight, where there is sometimcs a warehouse and a dwelling or two attached, there is scarcely a habitation visible in 300 miles. The plantations lie back from the river, and the houses and offices of the owners are bunt jar froM its banks, for sufficient reasons; fi rst, wwith ai their fyl yn beauty, these gentle elevationx are sai to be unhealthy; and next, they are often coriverted into islands, or even submerged, by floods which tiwe rapidly after heavy rains, sometimnes as much as. 20 and 30 feet above the ordinary level. The river *hen spreads into the valleys, changing the swanips into lakes, and the hollows into chimnnh which would cut off the dwellers on the heights from comniunication with the interior. In consequence of these ob,ections, the situations which appear to the eye most eligible building plots seeming to require nothing but a mansion or a villa residence to complete them, are left a 'wildernes, and are likely long to remain Eo. When the river issues from the hilly regio-n &nd enters the great level above Mobile the indictions of life become more visible. Corn and cotton advance to the water's edge; dwellings, with the never-failing background of negro huts, begin to appear, and cotton-presses on the shore to pack the staple at the spot of shipmient. Parties of negroes stop work to grin at the steamer as she sweeps by, and exchange shouts with sable acquaintauce among the crew. The river widens, and, though the banks are lower than the lowest elevations of the upper part of the stream, there appears to be less apprehension of fevers or floods,-the shore is no longer avoided and tenantless To navigate a steamer sAfely on such a river requires considerable skll and exact knowledge of localities, even by day; how It is done by night, throxugh the many short turns and bends, is a puz7le. The look-out ahead is into thick darkness, and the chief guide is the dim outline of the trees against the sly; but it is utfficient. The curves are paseed without mishap, though the boat is not a small ono. She draws very little water, not more than two feet probal,y, with the amall freight of the suramer aesson, but in length, breadth, and hoight of upper worka she "looms large,"and in some of the narrow channels almost fills the river. In these cuttings of the atream it looks only a good leap to the shore on either side. She has but one wheel, which is fixed at the stern; it is broader than the ordinary side wheel, and has, perhaps, not much less power than two aide ones This mode of propelling is commnon in the river boats, but not universal, as many of the veseels on tho smno line have the double paddles. The steering is done fom the head, and the helmsman, as the most valuable member of the equipage, is csrefully enclLwd in a glass cawe, or neat glazed apartment, which, like a tower, crowns the structu%% abov the passengers' deck, high and unapprEaclt'-be A request not to talk to the man at the cwheel is unntxry ; he is fenoed in from inhtusion, a;nd also guarded against the accident that befell aa a6ent brother of the craf-our Palinurus may dor,, but cannot roll overboard. A fair rate of speed Is kept up even through the darkness, and as the breeze on the rlver is soft and cool, and the berths rather close (with mosquitoes in waiting), many pamenger make a watch of the night, and smoke away most of the vigiL The lamws in the saloon are left burning, the strict rules of ocean steamers in regard to lights are relaxed on inland waters; card parties at the tables play steadily into the small hours; the black walters, released from duty after supper, take possession of the floor, stretch themselves into very easy atlitudes, and play cards also. The boat ploughs her way down the stream, through forest and swamp, in the deep shadows of which now ffit myriads of fire flies, the most beuatiful " decoration' of the Southern night. At one of the bends of the river the lamps of the " up" steamer are deseried at a distance, and a sigIal of three terrific howls is given from the steam-whiotle, answered by three equally hideons sent through the silence by the approaching boat. As they near each other two rockets are sent up as a salute, and, with a few friendly snorts from the engines, the boats pass and all is quiet and dark again. After some stoppages to land cargo, one to take in wood by the light of a cresset, filled with flaming pine knots, which attracts a cloud of moths to rush into it and be burnt hy thousands, and some hours' more steaming through the shadows of night, the steamer a little before daybreak is at the wharf at Mobile. The air is moist and clammy, giving the sensation of a hot dawn; it is not an agreeable one. In three hours or so a few stray vehicles arrive from the hotels, and the river stage of the journey is done. The mail steamer for New Orleans starts at noon, luckily, for Mobile is not an inviting place, very flat, very warm, not very busy, and infested with flies; Ina the last item, however, it does not stand alone,-the household plague is common on the whole coast. After quitting the Bay of Mobile the steamer skirts the northern shore of the Gulf of Mexico, into Lake Pontchartrain; a voyage of 18 hours brings her to the landing place on the lake, a cluster of piers, lighthouses, bathing-houses, and billiard-rooms, which have gathered round tne terminus of the Lake Shore Railway. The locality is very much resorted to by the citizen.s of New Orleans for fish dinners, fresh air, and other amusements; in half an hour by the train the city itself is reached. That it is an old French colony is evident the instant you land; the railway a'ois to travellers is posted in French, and pleasantly worded moreover; the regulations, you are assured, are solely pour la paix et le bien-tre des voyageur's, whose peace and comfort are not so avoweedly consulted on some northern lines that could be named. But it is impossible to say anything In French without a touch of gracefulness, to which the Saxon does not bend without effort. Thus there are extant tables of rules of grand hotels, drawn up precisely as if they were addressed to the convicts of a penitentiary, they. are so curt, imperative, and full of the " absolute shall" as to what the guests may or may not do. These things are better managed in French, -but this is a digression. The road to the city is over some miles of swamp, conquered at last by the railway; only a few years ago it was impassable to anything with wheels. Around the city, beyond the suburb; all is swamp and marsh still, except where the Mississippi sweeps along in the grand curve on which the city is built,-whence its name, the " Crescent City." The river is not so broad as its great name among streams leads one to expect; but it is very deep, and still nearly 100 miles from the seh. The shore is an embanlkent, the work of men's hands, the celebrated "Levee ;" the bed of the river has Deen dredged up to the side, and on it and behind itA citywards, is the long line of wharfs over which all the immense export trade of the place is passed. To the eye the difference between the level of the embankment and the streets is imperceptible, as its height above the highest water line Is only four fees, but from the point belowthe city where it commences to its termination above it, it is more than 160 miles in length, protecting a large tract of cultivated land from inundation, as well as the oity itself. The Levee proper, however, is the water front of the city; it is harbour and docks in one, a line of wharfs stretching for five miles, with tiers of shipping on one side, and all the establishments of a thronged port on the other-warehouses, stores, hotels, eatingheu , and bar-rooms. The wharfs are broad and planked, yet, spacious as they are, in the busy season they are piled with ootton bales and all kinds of produce that cannot be shipped as fast as the river pours it down from the interior. The craft moored along the wharfs show by their build that two kinds of navigation meet here as the point of junction; one is represented by the light steamers and boats of small draught which bring the cotton down the river; the other, by the heavier and stronger ships that bear it across the Atlantic. There cannot be a greater contrast than that between the smooth water adirner, light, lofty, and many-windowed-al glas and pel work abovo the water lie-and the long, low, dark-hulled clipper. Except that the both float, they are alike in nthing ; but they are eoch exactly suited to their purpose. From this alongahore region the city extends back over the soft marshy soil till the suburban streets merge into gardens and the roz6 into tracts not to be passed bywheels after much rain; and, as it has rained more or leos every day for the las three weeks, they arein such a succulent and spongy condition the cabmen will not undertake a rural drive without a promised insurance of the vehicle against tho danger of being pulled to fragments should it stick fast In a mudhole. There is one exception, however, in what is called the " shell road" to a point on Lake Pontchartrin. It bas been formed at great expense, and furnishes a drive of six miles over a hard and smooth surface, finer than the best macadam, a superiority due to tha materials-pulverized shells from the lake itself. It is the Corso of the city, and on it may be seen much fast trotting, with carriages of the most ethereal construction. But with only one roadthere are no les than three racecourses, on which Mr. Ten Broesk's horses have done wonders. The city covers an enormous spaco of ground, very regularly laid out, but, except in the centres of the busieu streets, not closely built. The oldest portion is stiUl almost ontiroly French, as much so as Montreal or Quebec; the traces of French tate and style of building in this section give it a little more variety than il commonly found in towns wholly Ame. rican, which repeat one pattern as exactly as pieces df honeycomb; they may differ in size, but in constniction they ar always the same. The old French quarter is still a sepaate community, and the senior inbabitants aro said to rega7d the Aneii can extoision of tho oity with no pride or approval, but rathor as a vexation and disturbance It is oven reported there are still in existence obstinate old Frenchmen who Ignore that addition altogether, wiU not believe in it, and have never extended their walkls beyond what was the reoognized boundary in 1815. From the great number of French names and fiams engaged in business in the second city which has grown up by the hide of the first the prejudice has not dscended to the present generation. In defence of the ancient., it must be admitted the extension is wholly the creation of commerce, and to any one out of the circle of business has few attractions. New Orleans is an enormous depbt for shipping cotton, with au annual 3eason of intense activity, and another of equally intense dullness. In the late autumn and winter it is crowded with busines men, planteri from the whole Mississippi region, and the host of persons connected with the trade; the shipping season over, they aU depart again. Thus, large and wealthy as the city is, it wants the features of a metropolis, of a centre of residence. It is commercial, and nothing else; cotton is the one thing supreme; cotton-growers, cotton-sellers, cottonbuyers, cotton-brokers, cotton-shippers, make its eason a vast cotton fair, attended by representatives from all the cotton-consuming world, for which it is now feared there Is not cotton enough. The enormous traffic has made New Orleans the second city of the continent in Importance-in one branch of commerce the first; but compared with New York it is stil very provincial, in some of the most agreeable features of a capital it Is behind even so small a place as Charleston. But the spirit of a municipality can scarcely grow in a centre deserted by most of its wealth and influence nearly half the year, and of which the fixed population is so cosmo. polite. Something might be done by the munificence of individuals, but as yet this world-wide commerce has not produced a Medici-not even a Girard or an Astor. Of the system of slavery that affects the life of the South so deeply much les is to be seen in New Orleans than might be expected. Relatively, the black population is smaller than in the towns of the Atlantic States; It is overborne, and to all appearance the negro cannot compete with the Irishman in the labour of the city; in no department, not even that of domestic service, is the African so predominant a figure as in Charleston and Savannah. In those places mueh of Southern life may be seen, still more in the plantations of the interior; but in New Orleans a white immigration appears to have swept over it, and of the " institution," though its result is piled up in every warehouse and is the mainspring of all its activity, little mcrre of it is to be observed than in Baltimore or Washington.
VOLUNTBEM2NG FOB THZ ABMY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES Sir,-On reading The TiMes of Friday last I was much struck with a paragraph connected with the present import. ant question of recruiting for the army. Under the head of Naval and Military Intelligence I see it stated that 300 men of the new battalion of the Queen's Royalshad left Colohester for Shorndliffe, where the staff was to be completed, and the training of the men, who were all recruits, would be prooeeded with. Now, these men will take at least six months before they can be available for any service. Why not adopt the plan suggested by "A Filda Officer of Militia," and cwept a regiment already formed and in a forward state of discipline ? I feel sure that if his idea were fuUy carried out it would greatly facilitate the filling up of the army. I do not speak without some know. ledge of the sabject, havlng had considerable experienoe both in recruiting and volunteering. During the late war a communication reached our regiment from the War-office, inquiring if we would volunteer for active servioe ? On the question being put the whole regiment almost to a man most enthusiastically stepped forward. I went to my company the next morning, when to my surprise nearly every one of them had altered their mind I said, " My lads, how is this?' " WelU, Captain," was the reply, " we believed yesterday that you and aU our officers were going with us, but if we are to be broken up and dispersed we will be - if we will go." Nor conld any argument of mine alter their resolve. And is this so very wonderful after all, seeing that most of these men were recruited by myself from my o wn village and itsimmediiate neighbourhood ? The fellowsnaturally preferred being with a man they knew, and had tried, to being spread through the whole service. Mine is by no means a solitary oase, and I firmly believe that if the Government would only accept the services of the militia as a body, allowing them to retain a certain number of their own oficoers, leaving the remainder to form a nucleus for a new regiment, the scbeme would succeed even beyond the hopes of " A Field Officer of Mhilit" with whona I most cordiaUy agree, not only as to the practicability of his plan, but also as to thecertainty of its success; and I can dareto answer for the greater part of my own regiment, should the authorities at the head of the department see this in its true Bght. I am, Sir, your obedient servantL E. BI xKedca, biept. 22.

AMEBIOA. fA porHa of ibe foUowing apperM in our Weond SOUTHAMPTON, SmP. 22. The United Statee' ateamship Vanderbilt, Captain Edward Eigins, arrived off Cowes early this morn ing with a&vices from New York to the 12th iszt., being two days later than those receivred by th Canard steame. Throughout the voae the Van derbilt eixperenced strong wrinds fonm south to south-east. She has made another eapital rua across the Atlantic, having left the pierhead at New York at 12.20 p.m. on the 12th and Sandy Hook at 2 p.m., and arrived at the Needles this morning at 3.10, where she was detained a couple of hours for a pilot. Thf Vanderbilt brings $1,272,200 la specie, and 180 passengers for Southampton and Havre, whence she proceeded after dixembarking her passengern for the first-named port. The Vanderbilt passed the steamer Baltic, from Liverpool for New York, on the 13th nIt., in LAt. 40 24, long. 68 47. The treaty with New Granada, providing only for the aDpointment of a commisoion for the settlement of alt claims against that Government, was signed at Washington on the 10th inst. The State Conventions of the " National Ameri can Party" and the " American Party of Massachusetta" met at Boston on the 10th. The latter body reaffirmed the Springfield Platfcrm. Both Conventions nominated the same ticket,' beaded by Gardiner for Governor, aud Alexander de Witt for Lieutenant-Governor. The nominations were made unanimously. Inthe evening a grand jointratification meeting was held at Fanenil-hall, whext the Governor Gardiner made a speech, accepted his re nomination, thanked both the Conventions, predicted the downfall of the Republicans, and, ami eat applause, announced that he stood upon the |pringfield Platform of 1855 in all its length and bieadth. . The Democratic State Convention was held at Syracuse on the 10th and 11th, and was throughout one of the most exciting and tumultuous sessions ever known. Gideon J. Tucker was nominated for Secretary of State, Lyman Tre'naine for Attorney. General, and Isaac V. Vanderpool for Treasurer. A despatch from Washington of the 11th says:"The Presdent hs recognzed Charles Edward Kortrih as Consul of Her Britanno Majest for Pennsylva to reside in Philadelphis, and Dennis Donohoe as Consl of Her hajesty at Bufrfal. The British Consul for New York hu not yet asked to be officially reoognized. A. M 1 Jackson, of iMisippi, has been appointed Secrtar of State for New lMleiico, vice Davls, resigned." The Independence Messenger of the 5th publishes a report that Colonel Sumner had overtaken the Cheyenne Indians, who were retreating towards Arkansas, and that a battle ensued between them, which resulted in the indiscriminate slaughter of 400 or 500 men, women, and children. The report was discredited at St. Louis. Ex-Governor Ramsey had been nominated by the Republican Convention at St. Paul for Governor of Minnesota The steamship Texas had arrived at E. elf Orleans from Vera Crux, with dates from the city of Mexico to the 5th. The Tehuantepec question had beea settled at Mexico by the annulment of both the Garay and the Sloo grants. The vomito was abating at Vera Craz. A Nicaragua recruiting rendezvous had been opened at Mobile. The St. Louis Democrat publishes an address to the people of the United States, prepared by the committee appointed by the Grasshopper Falls Convention, in which a history of the troubles of Kansas is given. The present attitude of affairs in the terntory is discussed. The address alleges that the chief incentive for participation cf the Free State man in the coming election is the urgent appeals from the Free States to do so. The address says, however, there is little likelihood of these appeals being successful. The document contains a special clause to the people of Missouri, setting forth the relative positions of Kansaus and Mtissouri, imploring the citizens of the Latter to refrain from another invasion, and saying that if she should continue her prcvious course of aggresion, a persistent, protrmcted, and bloody war must ensue. The address concludes by exhorting the people of Kansas to vote at the coming election in pursuance of the action of the Convention. The municipal election at Leavenworth, Kansas, bad resulted in the election of the Free State ticket by 260 majority. We have Utah dates to August 5, but the news received is unimportant. The southern mail had arived at Washington from all points as late as due. Dates from Brow'nsville are to the 19th ult. The harvest in the River Valley promised fair. The Mexican frontier was quiet. A letter from Bastrop, Louislana, states that the cotton crop in that vicinity would be an average one, unless early frosted or ravaged by the bail worm, which begins to show signs of vitality. In Caddo parish the bolls were beginning to rot from the prevalence of rains. In Clinton parish the bolls were opening fast, In reference to the late financial crisis the New Yorkc Shipping and Commercia3 List of the 12th inst. says:- "The panic in financial and commercial Crcles has par- tially subsided, but the depresioon, distrust, and embarassment remain. Several failures have ocourred In various departments of trade sinoe our last, and the trouble has been aggravated not a little by the circulation of utfounded rumours against houses of invincible strength. These rnmours may not injure the parties against whom they are directed, but they react upon weaker ones who are already suffering from heavy pecuniary liabilities, and can ill afford to bear up under false reports. It is impossible to foretell how long our present difficulties will continute, but somo weeks will probably elapse ere the effects of the pressure cease, and in the meanwhile bankruptcy and ruin may overtake a great many more of our business firms. Over importation s of many kinds of foreign mnerchandise, our xidiculous fondneEs for extravagance, our preference for speculrtion rather than production, must a& receive a check before trade and commerce can stand on a permanently better bass; and rwe are pleased to know that a more cautious and conservative spirit in this respect already obtains." John Thompson, the Wall-street financier, ras arrested on the 10th inst. in two suits. The plaintiffs were G. H. Bussing and Co., of Cincinnati, and the Wisconsin Bank. Mir. Thompson gave the required bail, and was released from custody. On the New York Stock-Exchange several now failures were announced on the 10th and 11th. The suspensionof Messrs.WilliamIJ.Bell andCo., bankers, o William-street, was announced on the lastnamed day, but although the firm had made a general assignment, which act was rendered necessary in consequence of two of the parties being non-residents, they confidently expected soon to resume payment. It was said that their asets largely exceeded their liabilities. Mlessrs. Bell and Co. were holdes of a large amoimt of western securities, which they could neither sell nor borrow money on, and were consequently compelled to stop payment. The domestic commission house of Frederick G. Swan had been compelled to yield to the pressure and make an assignment, but the assets of the house were considered to be ample. Among other suspensions the.ANeto York Morning .press announces the firms of Philip Allen and Son, of Providence; Robertson, Hudson, and Pulliam, dry goods, and Grsnt, Sayles, and Ford, produce receivers; the Bsiffalo C10ozmmecidl Adrertir, of Messrs.

CARDINAL WISEATAN AND THB INDIAN ATROOITEBS. TO THEI EDITOR OF THEF TIMlES. Sir,-It strikes me that your correspondent Cardinal Wiseman is riding off much too easilyfrom the controversy he has provoked. The main point of his apology consists of the suggestion that he is excused for his apparent indifference to the outrages and atrocdtes of the Indian mutinies because his sermon was delivered on the 26th of July, when, he says, " none of the accounts in detail of atrocities, &c., had been made known." I don't know what impression this language may bhve conveyed, or may have been intended to convey to the public, but I own, for my part, to an impresaion of its extreme deceptiveness, when I find in your columns of the 21st of July an account of the indiscriminate slaughter of men, women, and children at Delhi, and of " the distressing and horrible insults" to which they had been sabjected, and on the 24th of July mention of the murder and mutilation oi various ladies at Meerut. An ordinary Englishman making this subject his theme would not wait for minute details of these insults, nor, if he heard that his countrywomen were murdered and mutilated, would he wait to learn the number and form of the pieces into which they were hacked before he expressed his indienation pretty vehemently. An extraordmarij hLnghishman alone would express no feeling of the kind, but would use these atrocities as a text which he could wrench and distort into a condemnation of his own countrymen-the suffering parties-for their opposition to AbsDlutism in pohtics and Ultramontanism in theology. If, however, such an Englishman is an extraordinary specimen, he is lees extraordinary than the officious friend who contends that he remains in his native country at a great sacrifice, when there he is quite unique and a splendid curiosity, with some incidental advantages, such as the use of the leading type of The Times newspaper; while the alternative is to make one of the nob of Cardinals at Rome, who, protected by French bayonets, but poohpoohed by their countrymen, are effective only in reducing each other to insigenificance. I remain. sir vmnrs. A LAYMAN.
SPANISH ROBBERS, TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As your valuable .olumns are at present filled with so much that Is of extreme interest to every Englishman, I must apologize for asking your indalgence for these few lines. I hAve been a daily reader of your " oreign Intelligence" now for some years, and been strack with its oxtreme correctneM with regard to Spain. In your paper of Saturday you refer to the release by Spanish robbers of a son of Mr. Campos, of Malaga, and state "that the authorities are using every exertion to detect the retreat of the robbers." It may seem incredible, but is nevertheless true, that the authorities are perfectly aware of the retreat of Manuel Diaz, the chief of the band, and that, so far from taking steps to apprehend him, they actualy pay him a sort of " black nail," to enable them to visit their countryhouses unmolested. Manuel Diaz now receives money from some of the wealthiest families in Malaga, to allow them to paw to and from their countryhouses, which are situated a few leagtLes from the town, and the head of one of these families is a deputy, and2 has lately been created a marquis. I am. Sir. Tonr obedient mervant. SEVILLANO. Sept. 2L _

We entere the Straits of Sands on Tuesday morng, the 7th of J It Wa beautiful day, -ad we went ahead rapldlj, passing Angler Polnt the -me night, and waet on in the amVmanner tha ext y ntil the evening, when We aakoW about 40 mile, from the Straits of Baca, on accountof ie narrwwnaw of the pago a ahn lowne. of the water ;. prly on the morning of the 9th up anchor and away we wept, but very slowly, for the above reasn. The sceery was lovely. We anchored a,Ain at night, and next day hoped t?clear Banc, and arrive hare (Sinppore) on Saturday. Ay but so it was not to be. After staming on that monajng (Friday, thelOth) about 81 miles an hour we pud phe town of Muntok (the capital of Banca), when we aw reefs a-bead. TheND we clered, and along we went. About 9 30 am., as I Wa smoking x cigar with the purr of the Aip on the poop, suddenly bump she went and nearly threw us over. board. The engines were stopped at onoe, and the water rushed Into the engine-room, for she had a largel:ole in her bottom. After the shock I sdd, ' Now we have Jniashd our voyage in theTransit, nd though I am not ealy frigbtanod I was then, for I fnUy expocted she would break her hack every moment, and then the oonquenoes wouldhave been too awful to oontemplate. The eaptain eeing if was all up with the vessel, ordered the bbicoitb to be brfnght upon deck, and casks to be filled with as much waterma could be got out of the tank; meanwhile the troops -cad officers wres snt below, and the pumps set to work; s,nd I aure you, though we wore In the most imminent d4nger, the most perfect order ws preserved, and not a n±On left the place he was ordered to remain In, ansd all sat doin quietly, exocpt those who were employed. I had all tny things paoked up andready to get ut of the old tub Ifrthere was time, but the water poured in. I tooka p minto ths engine-room; the soldiers were working up to their necks in water. The great fear was the ship would sip off the rock, and then down she must haie gone instantly,tkifig with her mocre than 803 souls. All the bots were holst& out, and after remainngin herabout two hours, the59th Ir ordered on de I rushed into my cabin, and had only tUne to eime my great coat, &c., as before stated. We got Into4he boats, ad set off to a high part of a reef of rocks between us and the shore (the latter being about three miles and a-half off), as it was feared the ship would go down 'before all hands were cleared off. It was dreadful to aw the poor fellows when they were landed on the reef, bhaU of them without shoes (a most requisite part of clothing) ;their feoet were terribly cut and bruised, and a blarig stn shone piercingly upon us. All the troops were got from the sip by 1 'clock, and landed on the reef. The wor4 pert was now to come, for the tide, which was out when we were wreaked, now began to como in, and gradually to cover the reef where we were, and we knew that when the tide wa fully in it would be some ten feet under water. However, the boats came alongside again about 2 p.m. to take us in, but the offioer were ordered not to leave the plae tfll all the soldiers were shipped; however, some were obliged to go to preserve order and perform other various duties on arriving at the hore The boats could only carry about 200 at a tine, and there were 800 of us, so by the time the last were taken off it was nearly 6 p.m., and the water within a foot of us. I was the last who left the rock, and although I knew that if I remained another hour I must have been immersed, still I was not afraid, as I could eawly have swum to shore if it came to that. I was heartily tired when I landed, for I hWd been standing under a blazing n *all dLay, andbd eten nothing. Some biscuits had been brought from the ship, and a few pieces of bacon. I must here tell that the stern of the ship before this was under water, and we expected to see her slip off the rocks every moment, Well, there we were, safely landed on the Island of B&nca, with little dothing, food, or shelter; all I got that iight was about an ounce of biscuit and a bit of ban frizzled up to nothing, which I ate moat thankfuly, ad drank IL cup of water, slept under a tree, and was nearly devoured by ants and other insects, with which Banca abounds. The next morning I got up at 6, had a meal of the same quantity and quality as that of the preoding evening. The ship still remained, and upon examination it was found she was so fast on the rock that it was most probable she would remain there some time; and particularly fortunate it was, for at low water we were able to get a good many stores from her, and sails, with which we made tents. There Was a Datch steamer at Muntok, which came round to us, and the captain of the Transit was enabled to send despatches to Singapore for ssistanoe. What a weary time did we spend before a ship arrived, being Under a tent, vith bad food, &a., and a blaring sun I however, no one complained, but bore their misfortunes as British soldiers generally do. Some of tho offioers got a few boxes from the wreck, bat the things were damaged; but not one thing did your humble servant get. How delighted we all were on Sunday when the ship - arArved; there was not accommodstion for us all, so the 90th were sent on to Singspore next morning (the 20th). The same day the American ship Beaver cacao, and on Tuesday, the 21st, we all cleared off, having been on the Island U days. I slept in a miserable hole in the American ship, where I conld hardly breathe, and the rats were galloping over me in squadrons We got to Singapore on Thursday night and landed next morning, and went out to the encampment, about two miles from the town, to wait the means of .' tranFit' to China. The 90th will in all probability be sent to India to join its head-quarters, which went in the Himalaya, for the purpose of quellig the Sepoy mutiny. The Transit was nearly lost in the Southern Ocean a few days after we left the Islankd of St Paul; we had a most awful storm for three day;, our sails and spars went to the winds, and it has sine3 been acknowledged that had the gale lasted 24 hours o.ger every soul on board would havo perished and never so much as have been heard of; the sea was awfully high, bat the vessel hardly shipped any water; there was a very bad leak in her, the iron having split in one part alone 24 feet. Yeu will hardly credit it, but one day we pumped out of her 600 tons of water in the 24 hours. She leaked from the time we left Corunna, and, of course, it increased as we went on. The fact is, we ought not to have proceeded further than tho Cape in her. No one but those who were on board the Transit can have the least idea of the dreadfol perils we have undergone, We were allsingularly blessed with health, and aid not lose a single man the whole way out; but I fear the effects of our residence at Banca re beginning to tell, for some of the men re ill, nd officers also. Thank Gc.d, I am quite well myself, except when I am exposed to the midday sun; but fancy, the thermometer in the island of Banca s as high as 102 in the shade, and 12T in the sun."
ELECIO1N oF LoRD MAmoL-The election of a Lord Mayor for the city of London, in succession to Alderman Finnis, whose term of offioe expires in Novemuber, is fixed to take place on Wednesday next, the 29th inst. Sir R. W. Carden, M.P., is the senior alderman below the chair. Prior to the nomination the Lord Ma7or, the new sberiffs (Alderman Lawrence and Mr. W. F.

Albert Alston, M.A., of St. John's College Cambridge COosumwiox OF SmOFE nz MAORxE Boms.- Some timeago the Steam Collieries Association of Newcastle offered a premium of 5001. for tho best method of preventing smoke during the combustion of coal in marine engine boilers, and they appointed Messrs. W. G. Armstro6g and J. A. Longridge, cvil engineers, and Dr. Richtrdson, professor of cbymlstry, to perform the requisite experiments preliminary to the award. These gentlemen have not yet arrived at a final conclusion on the matter submitted to them; but they have recently presented their first report, in vhich they state that the trials they have made on a boiler of the ordinary construction employed in steamvessexs have already established the following facts :-L. That the NeWcastle coal commonly called lartley's may be used in ordinary nultitubular marlne boilers without making any smoke. 2. That this may be done without the adoption of any of the various schemes that were submitted to the umpires. 3. That it does not involve any lows of power or of economy, but that With a given boiler more water may be evaporated, while no smoke is made, than can be evaporated with the hardest fring on the usual xystem aooompanied by a dense black smoke; and, fdrther, tbat the quantity of water evaporated from lb. of coal is greater when no smoke is being made by from 17 to 22 per cent. 4. That the combustion of the coal is perfect, and its evporativepower far beyond what has usually been stated. In proot theee assertions statistical tables are furnished by the umpires, giving the result of two series of experiments which they instituted. The first series showrs the icrease of wvork done to be 38 per ocent. aud a superior economy of fuel of 17 per cent. while makin no smoke; and the second shows an mncrease of worsk done of 1 percent. and a superior economy of fuel of 22 per cent. The practical value of the data elicited by these experiments is alleged to be greater than that obtained from the investigations made by Sir H. De la Beche and Dr. Lyon Playfair on behalf of the Government, owing to a material difference between the apparatus dmploye& in the two cases.

D,r-LrIIGSTON AT EDINBURGH. The freeom of tho oity of Edinburgh was conferred on Dr. Livingston, the African traveller, ox MIonday afternoon, in Queen.street-haU there. The civic corporation attended inuthelr robes, and the hall was crowded with from 1,000 to 1,200 persos The burgess tioket purported to be conferred by the Town-council on Dr. Livingston ia testi. meony of their admxiration of the courage and uudaunted perseveranc7 displayed by him during his journey through South Africa, and their sense of the valuable and important services rnered by him in opening a way for the diffusion of the blesAings of Christianity and civilization among the inbabitants3of that hitherto unknown land. The LoRD PSiovosT, in preseating the burgess ticket, said,-I have now the honour of placing in , our hands this burgestickot, which contains the resolution unani. mnously adopted by the naemabers of this Town-council to mark the grateful sense entertained by us of your heroic effotts in the cause of religion and civilization. The exertions made by you to open a way for diffusing the blessings of Christianity and science in Central Africa have been contemplated by us with feelings of adiniration and gratitude. (Applause.) The country which yoa have choser; as the sphere of your philanthropio labours has long been regarded with solioitude by the inhabitants of Great Britaun. Mbany have gone before you and have trodden the path of scientific discovery. Ltke you, they have made vast aorifices in order to explore its hidden and unUpproached rocesses. To yous belongs the especial honour of being tte herald of the Gospel of Peace to the Inhabitants of that daxk and desolate region, and at the same time the Instrument of conveying to them a knowledge of the advantages. of commerce and civilization. The allimportant -object of diffusing Gospel light is that to which ypur energies have been first and chiefly devoted. Yont have practicaUy recognized the iuiportant truth that the adfantages of science are as nothing unless united to the beniga influence of our holy faith. (Loud applause.) The example which you have thus given will, we trust, be followed by many who wvll be encouraged by what you bave been enabled to achieve. For your success in the Christian and philanthropic work to which you are again about to detote yourself, let me assure yoa that our best wishes and inost fervent prayers go alo)Dg with you. (Ap. planse.) That your past and future efforts to accomplish this important object may be crowned with signal success is the fervent prayer, not only of us who are here met to do you honour, bat of many not now present, whose grateful attention excited by your past exertions will be anxiously directed to yonr future efforts-eff,rts on which blessings will be invocked byyour countrymea of your own day, and which we trust and believe wiU be the means of caling forth blessings on your memory from generations yet unborn, (Applause.) Happily throughout the vast extent of our country's dominions the blight of slavery has ceased to exist. (Applause.) It Is far otherwise in the country to ,which you are about to return. The ory of injured jusice may weU be raised from Africa to Europe, for we owe to her a large debt of reparation. May it be yours to aid in loosening the bands of the oppressed, and may you liye to witness the approach of the time when the soll of Afric shall be as free as is that of the land which gave you bith, and is prond to claim you as one of her sons. (Loul and prolonged applause.) Dr. IVYSNOSTON-, after thanking his Lordship and the audience for his reception, and premising that perhaps the most suitable acknowledgment he could make would be to communicate to them a little information about Africa, said,-There is a good deal of ignorance about Africa in England, just as we have in Atrica about England. (A laugh.) In fact, in that respect we are very much alike. I have been quite astonished at some of the questions put to me since my return to this country. One of the most commron is this-would the people of Africa be induced to cultivate the soil? Now, the fact of the matter is, that all the African triles who have it in their power oultivate t,e soil, except the Bushmen, who are an exception in every respect, and who neither cultivate the soil nor keep domiiestic animals, and never have any abiding place. Their language, too, is exceptional but all the other tribes of Africa show by their language and customs that they are one family of people. The Africans look upon us white people as only another tribe of men, and when I attempt to tell what their numbers mny be, they put to me the question, " Are they as many as a cloud of locusts I} If I say yes, they ask fuzther whether, if each of the white people were to take a locust into his hand, they would finish the whole cloud. Of course I-say I think they would. Then they will add, " Your Queen must be very rich indeed wvhen she has so many people." " Oh yes," I reply, " she is exceedingly rich ;" and I am asked, H Has she many cows?"-a question I really could never answer (laughter); and tben when I mention the fact that I have never seen the Queen they say, ' What sort of people must you be never to have seen your chief?" A. great many otber questions show the same kind of ignorauce respecting us. Many European gentlemen have gone to that country to hunt but, as the Africans have no idea of sport, they wonder to see gentlemen working so hard for a little dry antelope meat, -and they put the question to me, "' Have vour fnends no meat at homo ?" (A laugh.) Not wishing my friends to appear in such a 1igbt, I say, "These gentlemen could have beef every day of their lives if they liked ;" but they reply to me, "AIha you know better." (Laughter.) In reference to the cultivation of the soil, we find that they labour most- industriously, and that the grain they raise reguires more labour than the crop would do in this country. is true that in the south pazt of the country most labour falls to the share of the women, but they do labour most industriously In the north, and it takes thenr abouteight months of the yea to get their crop. In the central parts of the country we find that they are all anxious to trade, and, knowing tbis, I have not tho smallest besitation in saying that if eneguraged to cultivate the raw material for our manufacturts they would be delighted to do It. The interior has been hitherto shut UD to us, for many of the tribes arounAi the borders have beein most unwilling to allow the central tribes to get Intercourse with the white man ; and I am told that in the centre of the country many expeditions have gone tov*ards the sea coast, and rwere unable to get there owing to tho6e border tribes always wishing to get the trade ioto their own hands. Now, the object I have in view in going back again iq to try to make a path from the Bea to that central country. (Applause.) On the east side of the country we have a large river-the Zambese. This river does not rise where it has been always pointed out to do in the Portuguese maps. Instead of that, itrises from near the sources of the Nile, and flows from north to south in the centre ef the country. Nearly aU the rivers in that central part flow from the sides to the centre. and there they form that large river Zanmhese, which finds its way from the central valloy by u,eans of a large fissure through a, high ridge of country, and thenap,uears at that part whic the Portuguese maps have always panted out AS its source. It rises many hundred miles beyond that; and the Zambese is, I belUeve, really and truly an English discovery. My object in returning to that country is to try to get a permanent path to that central region from which most of the slaves have always been dra7n. The natie slave traders go into the central country and carry our manufactures there, and with a few yards of cloth they pnreoase slaves, and then take them down to the sea coast. The people are so anxious to get our manufactures that they part, not with their own children, but with children kidnapped from other tribe. Now I hope to be able to make a path up the Zambese to the oentral country, and then, if we can supply the people with our goods for lawful comanerce, we have a fair prospect of putting a stop to the slave trade in a very large tract of country. (Applause.) The people in the central part appear to be rather of a higher grade than those near the coast. When English people think about Africa, they imagine that all the Africans are like the specimens we have in front of the tobacconists' shops. (Laughter.) This is not the case at all. That is the real negro type that is only to be found in the lowest part of the population. The people generally are not altogether black. Many of them are of olive colour-or of the colour of coffee and milk, and usually the higher grades of society are of this lighter colour. I imagine that the type we see on the eminent Egyptian monuments is more near the type of the central population than the tobacco shop variety. (A laugh.) Thcee people are willing to labour if you are willing to pay for their labour; and 1 believe that capitalists employng labour and paying for it in Africa would find abundant scope for our own manufactures. The reason why I think so is this:-When I left Africa I saw the people busily engaged in their gardens, both men and women, all down tho Zambese-for in the centre country every man has his own garden, and cultivates enough for his own consumption. When we came among the Portuguese settlements my men were delighted with the fine gardens ahd the eoil, and they were very mtuh astonished the ortuguese did not cultivate more. Well, 1 believe, from having been them labour, snd from the great anxiety manifested to collect any little thing they can sell, they would cultivate cotton and other produce for our markets. When I reaehed the Mauritius I fonnd there a similar spec. tacle. [ found this little island of 35 miles by 25, which is only a mass of volcanic rock, and with a soil not at all eoral to the African soil, because there they could not raise suga without guano, producing by means of improved machinery su"a' eual to one-quarter the entire consumption of Great Britain. There they bring their labour from India. They pay the passage of coolies from India, giving them wages much higher than those common at Natal; still they become rich upon it. In Africa we have an amazing extent of country ttally untilled. In this country you sannot form any idea of the fertility of many parts of Africa When I went to the west I was obliged to use an ox-there are no horses in that country; bet still in passiDg through some distriots the grass was so high that I was obliged to hold my hands before my eyes to keep the grass out. Each stalk of grass there is about as thick as a goose quill, sad then we have immense dense forests of trees, about 50 feet high, running straight up without a single branch. Now, the soil that is capable of producing these trees and that vegetation, seems to me capable of producing anything. And we find tnat they actually do grow the sugar cane, and that they do grow cotton, but only to a sxinali extent. These people have great confidence in the English, such connldence as they have in no other tribe of white men. When I was l1tely with the Bakwain tribe, I found that -when any English gentleman came to that part of the country he alwayspaid his way honourably; and such was the confidence this honesty inspired that the natives would go with them NO miUes, all the way to Graham's Town, simply on the pronise of a small pyment when there. The would also ga with them to the north. and hunt with them for months together, serving them faithfully all the time, and trusting to their honour as Englishmen. They would not have trusted a Boer or any other tribe bub the English. ' I could appeal to English gentlemen who have visited that oountry that when they wanted two guides their only difficulty was lest four should go with them. From a numberof other circumstances I sea a probability of the interioripeople cultivating, their .produn in return for our manufactures. and my great wish is to link the interests of Africa with th&se of England, I have a t wofold object in xw. I believe that commerce i a ost itnportant aid in 4ftusing the blessings of iviliatio. l r, hear. )When a tribe gins to trade with anotho fieig A seMAs oN mutu*l .opegii)gce; and tbi6 is a ;im$ w- portnt aid in diffusing the blessings of ChristiasxI`Y, because one tribe never goes to another without telling tbe news, and the Gospel comes in to be part of thelr-j news, and the knowledge of Christianity is thus spread by means of commerce. Again, we know that our own country is in a great measure dependent for its supply of cotton on the United States. We are dependent for our supplies of this material on slave labour. Now, no Englishman is content with this state of things, and the majority of the Americans detest slavery as much as we do; but still we are goiDg to them with increased demands for cotton, which effectually helps the slaveholder to maintain his system. Now, I wish to direct the attention of my countrymen to this new field as a means of relieving slaveholders from feeling it is a necessity to havo slaves. If we get abundaut supplies of the raw material fronm Africa we shall soon find that the slaveholders will become more enlightened than they are at present. (A. laugh.) I have hopes of Africa from the fact that we have, both in Eastern and Western Africa, a healthy highland region. The form of the continent is a kind of basin. The central part is a basin for the rivers that flow from the sides, and then there is a dope towards the sea. This elevated region is quite a healthy one, and is watered and drained by the Zamb.'ese. From this point to the sea is about 600 miles, and there is only one rapid iu all that distance. Entering it from the ocean we have 300 miles of a good large river, then this small rapid; beyond that we have 3O miles more, and then wre are at the healthy ridge, which might he made a sanitarium, from wvhich both commercial and military enterprise might be carried to the less healthy rfegion beyond. This is the path by whic'h I hope to be able to establish trade with Africa. The Portuguese at prssent commnandthcoutletsoubothsides,butthey havestayatreated me with great kindness, and if the resources of Africa are developed they will get more by that development than any other nation in the world. They are not the masters of the country by any means. Their wars with the Caffres have not, like ours, been paid for by the mother-country, and In fact they kept them shut up in their fort at Teteduring two whole years. The chiefs who have beaten the Portuguese consider them as a conquered tribe, and oblige one of their villages to pay tribute almost annually. They have a knowledge of the mouth of the Zambese, and might aid commercial enterprise very effectually, and from the knowledge I have of the enolightened young Eig of Portugal I believe the Portuguese will not he wanting in their duty in that respect. On tho opposite side of the continent they have ex. mrt from Atgflr worth 100,000. annually. EIad Angola reen in the hands of the English, the export, I believe, would have amounted not to thousands, but to millions, because the country inland from Angola, and likewise on the east coast, is fertile eyontiuanythiug I can convey an Impression of. It is disagreeably fertile, for everytoing rfowsUp with only too n uch fertility. I again thank the erovost for the honour he has done me in presenting me with the freedom of this ancient burgb. I shall always -remember with gratitude the kind reception you have given me. I go hack not expecting to meet with any of this excitement or lionizing, hut to engage 5n hard work. I hope your sympathies will continue to go forth to that couatry, because 1 see plainly that England will every year become more dependent on that continent for the supply of the raw material of her commerce. (Loud a nd prolonged After he had sat down, Dr. Lrvn'OSrOr again rose and said, a question had been put to him-did these tribes employ slave labour? The tribes in the interior might be said to employ slave labour in this way-when one tribe onquered anotber it took the people of the donquered tribe into subjection, and called them tiher children. Their condition approached to that of slavery, but there was this difference between it and the American slavery, that there was no Fugitive Slave Law. (Applaue.) They were called children, but their condition was rather that of serfs. Each man had his own land to cultivate, and his own family and house, but when his master went forth to war he accompanied him as a servant, and must fight in his defence. The Ebildren of the serf, however, became exactly like the tribe whbch had conquered their parents. They were initiated by circumcision, and there was no difference between them and the native members of the tribe. Every tribe tried to augment their power by adding to their number by means of conquest. but the amount of service the conquered had to render was very small ind&ed. They sat down with their masters, and were nearly on an equality with them, and if not kindly treated they ran away, and the tribe to which they went generaUy received them with great kindness, and they became " children" there. Approaching the Portuguese settlements, however, they found slavery more perfectly developed. People there were bought and sold as slaves, which they were not in the central country. Hi3 men never saw chains until they approached the Portuguese settlements. They seemed to regard the chained men there as mere beasts or things, and that they could not be men from the way they were enslaved. Dr. Livingston withdrew amid loud cheering, and the meeting separated.
CITY COMiMISsOZT OF SEWERS. Yesterday a Court was held for the despatch of public business, Mr. Deputy Christie presiding. DANGEROUS E3ILDLNOS. Mr. Depuxty HOLT said, it would be satisfaotory to him to know the extent of the powers of the commission with respect to buildings in a ruinous and dilapidated condition. On Sunday week last his attention was called by several persons to a house in Holiday-yard, COeed-lane, which understood had been condemned as being dangerouw, not only to its inmates, but to the pubtic at large, and which ought to have been puUed down long ago. Ee has been informed by the inspector of the district in which the house was situated that -he -had called at the office of the district surveyor several times for the purpose of urging him to take immediate steps for pulling the house down, but nothing had been done la the matter. The inspector -was caUed into court, and in answer to questions put by several members stated that he had caUed at the office of the district surveyor nearly every other day from the time when his attention was first directed to the matter by Mr. Deputy Holt. Although he had not seen the surveyor himeelf, he had on eaeh occasion of his visiting the office brought the subject to the notice of bis managing clerk. No hoarding had yet been placed in front of the house. Mr. Daw, the Chief Clerk, read a letter from the district surveyor, in which that official stated that the house in question was in a dangerous condition, and requtred to be pulled down, and asked for the orders of the Court with respect to it. Mr. WATERLOW.-Surely an end ought to be put to this Circumlocuton-office. It is quite certain that a rotten house wil not stand while all these unnecessary forms are gone through. (Hear, hear.) Mr. ABRAILUA-There was ample time for the district surveyor to have made a communication upon this subjeot last week instead of to-day. Mr. Deputy ATCIIISON said, that in a case of emergency like the present he thought the distriet surveyor ought to be invested with power to interfere and to take steps for in uring the pblio safety without waiting for the orders of the Court. (tuear, hear.) The discussion was brought to a close by the clerk's being desired to write to the district surveyor to know the reason for his delay in communicating, the dangerous condition of 'he house in question to the commission. SANITARY STATE OF TIIE MTY. The Medical Officer of Health (Dr. Letheby) reported on the condition of 151 houses that had been inspected durlnm the week, and he presented a lit- of 35 places that requirea the orders of the Commission for their sanitary improvement In various particulars. The mortality retarns for the week were below the avere for this season of the year. The total number of deaths was 48, while the number for the corresponding week of last year was 53. Diarrhrea is steadily on the decrease, there aving been but six deaths from it during the week, and of these five were among infants. Fever, however, is on the increase, as is usual at the beginning of autumn. It was fatal in six cases, two of which occurred in each of the city districts. The report concludes as follows:- "A letter has been sent to the commIssIon by Meswra. all a Hunt. solicitor, of New Boswell ceurt, saying that they are instructed 1s Mr. Charles Walde, the landlord of the bouse No. 3s, lAwrecoe Pountney-=,se to take seasaxes for the abatement of a nuiaucse cauaed hy mers Nesbllt, the skin mnerchant,, of li9, Upper Thamesstreet.

Mr. XAsoi, for the amsiguees, sald, they were willing that a certificate should now be granted to M. Low. The other bankrupt wns at Valentia, engaged in recovering debts due to the estate. It was the duty of the assignees, however, to call the attention of the Court to the leading facts in the case. The bankrupts comrnenced business in April, 1855. The only caTital was 9(O1. as brought in by the abEent bsnLpkruP the unsecured debts were now 9,2001., and there were 1, 900 owing to creditors holding security. The assets includedaconsiderablesum of alleged goodauddoubtfuldebts. ut never did assignees have to deal with such a list of debtors. One was "gone abroad,"asecondwas "altogetherhopeless," a third was " off to Rio Janeiro,' a fourth was " bankrupt," a fifth said he was a " creditor," a sixth (Mr. Oswin, mer. chant, of Gresham-street, Old Broad-street) was 'gone abroad for forgery," a seventh " oould not be found," and n dighth was 1 bankrupt," andso on, Altogether, 5001. were all that had been realized. Mr. GFORGo!, for the bankrupt, said he had been unforturate in having been introduced to such a connexion. There was a olam of 4,00Q. npon oue Sorriano, in Spain, and the bankrupts had been disappointed of a large sum in conse. quence of Messrs.

BRISTOL DISTRICT COURT OF BANZBUPTCI' Spteicr 22. IRE WILLIAM HENRY SMrrH.-RrYuSAL OF CERTICATE. Rofort. Ar" Tr-, The bankrupt, who was a barrister, and member of tho South Wales circuit, failed in June, 1846, as a newspaper proprietor and printer. No dividend was paid on this ocCasion. In May of the present year he was again gazetted as a brickmaker, carrying on business at Swansea. The allowance of a certificate was opposed by Mir. 3dlin, of the Western Circuit (instructed by 31r. Charles Taddy, solicitor, of Bristol) on behalf of Mr. Frederick Lambe, mercbant, of Lombard-street, LQndon,who wasformerly in part. nership with the bankrupt. Mr. Clifton (from the office of 21essrm. W. Bevan And Girling, solicitors, Bristol) supported the bankrupt. To-day the learned Commssiolua delivered the follow. iug judment, which embraces all the facts raised on behalf of teopposg creditor, together with the points urged in oavo the bankrupt:-This was an application for a certificate by WiUiam HenTy Smith, who is described as of Swansea, in the county of Glamorgan, brickmaker, in a petition whereon he was adjudged a bankrupt on the 16th day of May last. In the year 1846 the applicAnt himself sued out a fiat in bankruptcy in this court, and in the same year received his certificate. On that occasion, although the balance-sheet held forth large ex. pectations of dividend, yet the assets were insufficient to defray the cost of the prooeedings, so that no dividend was reoelved by the creditors. On the former occasion the aplicant failed as a newsper proprietor and a Y)rinter. He now ascribes his failure to his embarkig in trades of which he had but a slight knowledge. As the applicant is a barrister, the fact of his not being oonversant with [either of the trades in which he has been engaged is hi,ghly probable, although as he recommenced business after bis first bankruptcy without capital the present position of his affairs might not have been very different, however great his capacity for conducting the concerns of a hriekmaker. The present application for the allowance of the certificate was not resisted by the aesignees or by more than ono of bis creditors. MIr. Lambe, however, the opposing creditor, who has proved a debt for 2,2351. 13s. 6d., has made out a very serious case of misconduct against the bankrupt. It appears that in the month of March of last year Mr. Lambe, being desirous of employing his capital in manufactures, advertised his readiness to become a partner in some established concern. The bankrupt answered the advertisement. Mr. Lambe, who then resided in L-indon, repaired to Swansea, and entered into negotiations with the banklrupt for aw share in the brlckmakiag trade, and at len2th agreed to pay L,5001. as the premium for admission to a third share in the concern, and also as the purchase money of a third share in the plant and stock. It was further agreed that Mr. Lambe should have assigned to hira one-third share of the bank. rupfs interest in the lands and premises whereon the business was then carried on, and also that a lease from the Duke of Beaufort to the bankrupt, granting a right to get the clay used in the manufacture of the bricks, should be assigned to the firm. This agreement was formally Incor rated with a deed of copartnership, and the whole transact'on appears to have been oonducted with deliberation ; yet at this very time all the plant and stock had been transferred to the bankrupt's solicitor, Mr. Strick, by a biU of sale du'y registered given to ecure the repayment of a debt of 1,0418. bearing Interest at 10 per cent. per annum, Mr. Strick to enter at any time into possession on one day's notice unless princlpal and interest were then iu-mediately paid. And with regard to the assignments to be made to Mr. Lambe and to the firm, the whole property so to be dealt with was under mortgage for amounts which as it now turns outleave no surplus. Pasing by various parol statements of the bankrupt unfounded in fact, and having for their object to inspire confidence in the security of Mr. Larabe's investment (which comprised other advances than those specified), the Court is driven by the evidence to the conclusion that the new partner was inveigled by fraud into a concern which Mr. Strick, the holderof the bill of sale, might have stopped at any moment, and that such fraud was not the offspring of sudden temptation, but was carefully concocted and matured. The difficulties in which the bankrupt was involved soon coming to the ears of the deluded party, differences, as might hAve been expected, qsickly arose between the partners, and Mr. lambe took steps to dissolve the disastrous partnership, although at the loss of a large portion of his capital. Soon after the dissolution Mr. Strick enforced his clalnis, swelled by a new loan and arrears cf interest, which extended not only to the stock and plant, but to the household furniture of the bankrupt, thus reducing the assets to a tri'ding amount, quiteinsufficient to defray the costs of the bankruptcy, unless the pro. ceeds of the biU of sale can be recovered by th asesignees from Mr. Strick. The bakrupt held forth and it is just possible he may ha-e sincerely entertained grat expectations of the value to be realized fom some building land, of which he became the owner at a low price by the generosity of a friend. This land, however, which was heavily and repeattdly encumbered, has been sold by tlle first mortgagee, and the produce of the sale is insufficent to satisfy the other encumbrancers. The unhappy rsultforthe creditors is a deficit of upwards of 13,0001. subject toa reduction of some 1,4001. if the assignees aresuceessfe intheir action against Mr. Strick. Shoild, however, that be the event of the suit, the bankrupt can derive no advantage from it in the consideration of his case, as the accession to the estate consequent on a verdict in favour of the asignees will not arise from any act of his, but, on tle contrar,v, will be a fund of which he did what in him lay to deprive his oreditors. I omit the enumeration of several important facts, all, I am sorry to say, unfavourable to tle applicant, because even concluding here I cannot bring mrself to believe that I should not betray my duty to tie opposing creditor and to the public if I aowed an cert*icate or afforded any protection to the bankrupt. The application must therefore be wholy refused. Mr. W. BEvAN, on behalf of the bankcrpt, apphled for protection to enabli him to prosecate an appeaL lie (Mr. Bevan) had received a letter from the bankrupt that momrn ing, in which he stated his intention to appea in the evenlt of an adverse judgmant, and though he (Fr. Bevan) would express no opinion as to the result of that appeal, he asked forjiTotection to the banlkrpt for 21 days. His HoNoun.-What protection does he want to enable him to appeal? Mr. Bzvxa-He may be taken in the meantime on a "Ba." certificate. Eis Hoxov.-l don't see that if he were in prison he would-thereby be prevented from appealing. If the Cout could say fist of all that protection is necesry to enable the bnkrupg to appeal, and, secondly, that the protection askedfor would not beused for other purpoees, it would bs very much inclined to yield to the application ; but a6 it does not appear either that protection is required for the purpose of phoecutinean appeal, or that if granted it could be niited for that ob ect, the protection must '.a refused. At the same time, I ba-ve reason to beheve that so long as the bankrupt usos his liberty merely for the purposes of an appeal, and evinces a dispostlon, as I trust he will, to add to the assets in his estate, which at present aim very small, harsh meaures will not be adopted agaimt him. Mr. BEvA was assured that the opposing creditor, M- atmbe, would not take any such mesunres, but he feared UW. assignees might arrest the bankrutpt. Mr. TADDY said that so long s the bankrupt kent himself in communication with the assignees, and ssdtise " them of his lone;ftMdss in resDeot to the appeal, uInothrud Lbe done to deprive him of his libe,-tv.
!.rSO YE..YT- DBBTORSW OOURT, 2euday, Sept. 22. IN THE MATTER OF SAMUEL REYNOLDS. Wo.iore Mr. Commqioner MVTmvn i Au incoiyen; was Opposed by Mr. Sargood for a fr. Wilhams, as next friend of Amelia Newsom. Mr. Reed supported. The question raised in this case was whether the insolvent had committed a breach of trust in his character of executor. He had acted jointly with the widow of the testtor, and after her death he was sole executor. Amelia Newasom *is oce of four children, and she had resided with hI famil3r for some years.

A(IDDLRSEX SnSSrOF,% usday, Se&pt 22. (Beforc Mr. CREASY.) Georie Mean, butcher, and Charles Hughes, csiis Murphy, diover were indicted for stealing three heifers and one stee, vain0 W0., the property of MIr. Beriah Drew, of Streatham, one of the magistrates of the county of Surrey. X Mr. Ribton, instructed by Meswrs. Drew and Gray, appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Metcalfe appeared for Hughes. Mean wau not defended. John Harradine, beiliff to the prosecutor, stated that on the llth of August he turned 18 beasts into a field at Streatham, and on the morning of the Frids.y following he mised four-three heifers and one steer. Itappearedfrom the evidenceof a numberof other witnesses that on -the day when the cattle were turned into the field the prisoners drove three heifers and a steer to* sdaughter, house in Holywell-street, Shoreditch, the proprietor of which was a Mr. Swallow, to whom it was represented bv Mean that be-had brought them from Romfotd-market. Ie asked permission to leave them there that night, and wanted to borrow lOs., as he sdd, to give the drover to fetch more beasts with; but he did not let him have it, and they went away. Next morning Mean went to the premises with another man, and elaughtered two and drove the others away. The skins were taken away; but the prisoners were taken Into custody on the following day, and Mr. Swallow identified the skins of the two which were slaughtered upon his premises-one more especially from a pecullar twist of the tail. Oni the 8th of August Mean had asked if he couldleave any cattlewhlchhemight bring from Romford-marketatMr Swallow's, which was assented to, and when he brought the cattle in question they were quite warm and fatigued, as if the7 had been driven hastily and some distance. The two 'which were -driven from Swallow's were driven to another elaughterman's, Mr. Caulliford's, in Holywell-lane, by the prisoners. Mrs Culliford reoeivadthem, and Mean told her that he had broughtthem from Maidstone-market, and desired that they might be killed at once-the sooner the better. Accordingly Mr. Cullford who was not at home when the heifers were brought, slaughtered them when he bad fnished his own business, and Mean asked that the carcases might be sent to Newgate-market in Culliford's namne; but le refused toallow that, and beginning to suspect that something was wrong he gave information to the police, and subaequentl, when Mean cAme to finally arrange about the sale of the met, he asked him to go and have a glass of beer at a publichouse, where a deteotive was watting, and he was taken into custody as he could give no satisfactory account of his possession of tho cattle. He told the offioer he had bougbt them at Maidst4ne-market on the Tuesday of a person whom he did not know, and when Hughes was taken he said he had been only employed as a drover, and the witnesses stated that he apPear to act under the directions of the other. Iean seold four skins to zr. Davis, skin salesman, of Commercial. road, Rotherhitbe, who disposed of them to Mr. Brown, tanner, of Bermondsey; but from Information communicated they were kept by them until seen by Harradine, the bailif who positively identified them by marks and their oolour as t me skins of the beasts stolen from his master's field. He mentioned the marks before he saw the skins. Mr. Swalow identifiedthe skins of the two kiled al his place, as did Mr. Culliford the skins of those slaughtered upon his, premises, and the four were sworn to by the baliff. Mean, who seemed a very cuning fellow, and perfectly conversant with the proceedings, cross-examined the witnesses with a view of making out tbat a " countryman ws with him when the beasts were taken to be slaughtereda but it was positively denied that such -was the fact. In his defence he produced a pieoe of paper which he said was the receipt for the money he paid forthe cattle, and said he was prepared with two witnosses to prove thathe purchased them at a publichouse in the City-road of a man who stated that he had brought them from Maldstone, but when called, no one answered. Mr. Mlff'LivE said, Itwonfldbeawasteof time to say moie than a few words oat behalf of Hughes, for it was clear beyond doubt that, whatever might have been Mean's share in the matter, Hlughes had merely been employed as a drover and paid for his seivices. Mr. CiEASY then summed up, and The jury found Mean GuiUty of receiving and Acquitl Hughes. Mr. CREASY said, Mean's offence was a very serious one, ndone which within his ow recollection was punished ith death. At the present time the sentence for such a crime generally wasthe next highest known to the law, but in this case he should pass a sentence of only four years penal servitude. George Thomas, 40, and Andrew Terry, 24, turner, were indicted, Thomas for stealing a cashbox containing 191,, the Kroperty.and money of Francis Croucher, in his dweUing. nouse, andTerry for feloniousy receiving the same. Mr. Gent prosecuted ; Mr. Sleigh appeared for Terry. The other prisoner was not defended. On the afternoon of the 2th of August a eshbox was stolen from the Perseverance publichouse,in Weton-street, Somer's-town, kept by Mr. Croucher, the prosecutor. Mrs. Croucher had given change to a customer, and left the cashbox in the bar perlour within view of the prisoner Thomas, who was sitting in front of the bar. There was a door in the passage opening into the bar parloor, and Mr Croucher went upstairs, leaving the servant in charge of the bar. The door of the pubic parlour was opposite that of the bar parlour. Seeing Mrs. Croucher go upstairs, loaving the o'shbox-in the bar parlour, Thomas said he should go into the publio parlour and have a sleep. In a quarter of an hour the cashbox was gone, and the prisoner Thomas had also disappeared. No one but him could have had aoeee to the bar prlour door. Thomas was ssen in the stet going away from Croucher's with something under his arm, aud v crson named Dobby watched him and the other prisoner mtothe bask yard of a house in be Asme street, where he heard a noise as if a box was being wrenched oden. Terrwent away with something in a bag, 'and DoXy depoed shat Terry told him next day that he threw the Msbbox into the Thames, and had given a man nicknamed " Blue" 81. 4. of the money. The jury found both prisoners GuiRy, and they were sentenced each to eight monthsl hard labour. Eliz.beth Fammonl, aged 1l, was indicted for stealing a gold ley ypncUlase and lf. 3s. 6d. in money, in the dwellingrg,ouse of Alert Turner, her imaster.

The constable in the case said, he ws desied the magistrate to inform the Court that she pleaded of stealing the money, Ent she was committed to tis oucrt for trial so that she might be sent to a reformatory for a loager period than a magistate could order, as although so youag she had been iR prison three times for felony already, and her parents wreo honest and industrious persons. Mr. CRESAy sid, if he could have tried the case acording to his own personal feelings he should have done his utmost to convict the girl for the very purpose of sending her to a reformatory- for a long period, which would almost have insured her permanent separation from those courses of crime to which, though so young, she had unhappily been addicted; but in point of law the offence with which w'ce was charged was not proved against her, and of cou-se i she was entitled to an cquittaL The learned judge then addressed the prisoner in a most feeling manner, and besought het to return to her parents and become a good girl, and so avoid the eonseanences of continuing those vicious habits which had already brought dis,grace upon herself and misery upon her father hsd mnother. Mary Ann Myers, 36. was indicted for unlawfully and ?aliiously wounding Margaret Rusb.

POLICE. BoW-sTrnEr.-Mr. Bodkin attended before Mr. J DIN1, being instructed by the Solicitor to the Treeasry to agply for summonses aainst the owners of severel houses in lolywell-street and Wych-street under the reoent Act for the suppression of the traffic in obsene books and prints. During the day Superintendent Durkin, aisted by mix inspectors and a strong body of polioe, had been engaged in executing a number of search warrants issued by Ar. JAitDIEN, and ouch secrecy had been up to the last moment ob. cerved that the denizens of Holywell-street were completel taken by surpris. Between 2 and 3 o'clock the polioe tool possession of the street, guarding the approaches not ouly to the thoroughfsres, bnt to each of the houaes, so that it was impossible for any of the "'property" to be removed. Some littl exbitement inevitably arose, but the presence of so largea foroe of constables effectually prevented disturbanoe On the articles seized being brought into court, Mr. Bodkin observed that the magistrate was already aware of the nature of the prooeedings, whioh were thken under the Act introduoed last session by Lord Campbell, which it was hoped wonld enable the Government to out down the hifamous exhibition and sle of obscene books bid prints, The Act gave power to the magistrate, on evidence being given of the purchase of such obscene books, to issue a warrant to search the precises. ThLt had been done, and the inspectors were in attendance with the property seized. He had now to apply for smnmonses agsinst the keepr Of the houses to show cause why the books, &c., shoud not be desyed, reservlng only such as were required to be produoed in evidence in further prooeedIngs. Large qanmtities of books, prints, sereotype plates &lc., were then produoed by Inispectors M!Kenzie, Mitchell, Webb, Firan, Bathers, and Lester, ard by Sergeant Thomas, who deposed to their havfng found them in the houses searched under the wrants before referred to. In one instance some books of a most detestable chara4ter had bsen found conoeald in a pair of boots. In another they partly consisted of copies of a paper called PauZ Pry, the publisher of which is now undergoing a sentenoe of imprisonment. Mr. JRDNE granted six summonses, four againt the occuplD of houes in Holywell.street, and two in Wychstreet.

The next day she saw the prisoner give the baby something from a bottle which contained *nisWd The prisoner asod her if she could not get something from a doctor to " sleep a baby." She replied, she did not know. The prisoner went out, and returned with something in a bottle, and then poured part of the oontents of the bottle down the throat of the baby, which struggled very much and atterapted to vomit, but the prisoner put her hand over its mouth. She asked prisoner what she had been giving the baby. She replted, " Only cold milk." In about a minute prisoner sid, I Look at the baby; I don't think it will ive; its eyes smem fixed, and I'm sure it won't live long, for its nose seems Anched in."

Among others, he states that in the expedition to :Egypt there vrere two Bomnbay regiments, the 2d battalion of the Ist, and the 2d battalion of the 7th; that they were low caste fellows, that they were sick when thoy landed, and could not crosu the derert, and that thev never reaohed Alexandria. The whole of this statement, with the ex. ceptica of the caste of the men, is onfonnded. These regiments landed at Cosseir with General Sir D. Baird, crossed the desert with hiss and his army, and 2marched to Alexandria, where they were quartered in, I thlnk, Fort Triangulaire, and I myself joined the 2d battalion of the 1st regimead when encamped at Abolkir (six -miles frwn Alexandria, on the road to Rosotta), in the month of Jannary, 1602.

ZIU '( XANbIAN MUTINIES.-BBLIEF FUND. ---------- On Monday evening thero was a orowded meeting at the ' mblic room of the town. AU the acting magistrates of tbh 3orough were present, And tnost of the gentry or lea". radesmen of the town. Both members for the her g Ur. Whitbread and Mr. Barnard, took pat in .he pre. ,et d'ings. ,ep Mr. r. J. GREEr moved a resolation eypr tve oE pathy for the soLfferera by the mutinis ns The Rev. R. W. FITZPATRICK seco ade9 the resoluti die alladed to his early companions Ap with Colonel E- vardes, and quoted, from n speech. e.elivered by that gallavi. -fficer at a missionary mneeting in Peshawur12 months t o , . description of the ultimate min hsion of EnRla in " dipo which the earne-it.mindedI here' had set downa tepo clamation of one God to theY-lindoo and of the Mahomedan." idnado oeMdstrt Mr. BABTNARD, lMP-, xfspudiated, on behaef of 'tho Government and people of ungland, any deliberate sentiments of revene ;-pleaded t0 e peaceful character of the modes adopted by Englishaeer in the propagation of *teir religious principles il oppOsitit ,n to those who complainedthat Christians must have bee . remiss in the discharge -of their high responsibilities to t'ae Hindoo; and, lastly, predicted that many blessed reSo'5ts would flow from that wlidh as yet appeared only disar rrous. The Rev. L JusREs moved the second resolution, and appealed for t~ne sympathy of Christian prayer, and the upstantial lp with which such sympathy ought to be trlWEunrrs AD, M.P., said,-It has beenthought desirable that 'both your representatives should utter a few 'words, il order that you might know what are the sentiments cf the men you have sent to the Commons' Honse of Parliamxent ata crisis of such graveimportano.o Wehave met, my frI-ands, on amost melancholy oceasion,and in a manner the most solemn by wbich a towyn can be convened, to testify our deep humiliation and grief at the calamity whioh has so suddenly surprised our fellow-eountrysnen in the East, to commnence a subscription, which I hope will only be the foreranner of soine general and even national provision for the victimsof thiscalamity; and,lastly,to assare theGovernment that as far asBedferd is concerned there is perfect willingness to support any nieasures that may be requisite not only to avenge the lost, but to restore rule and order, and even something better, to the afflicted provinces of India. It is not my object to raise auy exaggerated feeling against the Sepoys (some feeling of a vengeful nature is but natural), nor to inflame the mournful anger you may feel into anything likec an unhallowed revengeThey, poor misguided men, will have to suffer terribly for the wrong that they have done, their doom is already fixed and sealed-it is carried towards them on the dripping bayonets of Havelock, and it is heard in the gruns that are now booming over Delhi. I well remember that when this mutiny first brok, out there were not wanting those who attributed it to the interference and meddlesome disposition of missionaries, which hbad, at least, given the priests a handle for raising alarm in the minds of both Hindoo and Mahomedan lest their religion should be taken from them; but havingbad some opoortunity of consulting unprejudiced witnesses of missionariy effort, who know qui-e well what has been the general course of conduct among themn, I ani inclined to took for the causes of this outbreak in a far different direction. We have had possessions in India for 100 years,-howv much have we done for it? We have boasted of its wealth and of its countless population. We have painted the names of its cities and forts upon the flags of our regiments; we have (in the opinion of all civilized nations) governed India well,-but have we Christianized it? I fear wo have shrunk too much from meddling with the prejudices of a corrupt and enslaving superstition. No people are better able than the pepeof Redford to describe and appreciate religious iberty. The most glorious associations of the town are with the trials and triumphs of that sacred cause, but even here I would fearlessly ask, is it neceseary for the maintenance of true religious freedom that we should not only tolerate, but actually foster a burdensome and foul superstition ? The time is coming when we must speak plainly- and I believe that our own hands have helped to maintain the altar of the Hindoo; and now see what is the sacrifice they have offered on that altar. Oh, be sure that the smoke of that sacrifice and the ory of that blood have gone up to Heaven, and that cry wiLl yet ho an.:wered. The time for full inquiry will come, must come, but long ere then the dust of what once was Delhi will be scattered on the winds, and the wild storm now raging inthe provinces of I'ndia will have stilled. Meanwhile, we shall go hack to Parliament, bearing with us your clearly expressed sentiments and wishes. Letus hope that we shail meet with many others there like-minded with ourselves - and -while we trust that whatever burden you may be called upon to bear wiLl be borne cheerfully, we do ardently hope that our glorious army in the East, who never had a more glorious prize to fight for, and never fought for any prize more gloriously, will not be impeded in their victorous progress by the lukewarmness of Parliament. After several other speeches, The MtAYOR announced the names of an acting committee, and convened a meeting of the committee for the following day at his own residence, in order to institute forthwith a domiciliary canvass of the town. HUDDERSFIELD. A publlc meeting of the inhabitants of Huddersfield, convened by the Constable, in com liance with a very numerouisly signed requisition, was held at the Philosophical Hall on Monday eveniing, for the purpose of originating a SUbSciPtIOn in aid of the fund for the relief of the English sufferers by the dreadful massacres in India. The following letter from Mr. Edward Akroyd, M.P. for the borough, addressed to Mr. T. P. Crosland, was read:- Bankdeld, Halif ax, Sept. 17. "My dear SIr,-I an glad to bear thatt iuddssdeld will be one of ti e Osti among the towns of the West Riding to express sympathy with our fellowvcountr;men anc women InIndla whobavesuffered unto!d cruelties frem the barbarous aad fanatical Seposs-monster3 in human shape-who have forfeited au claim upon our comxmon humanity.

I am, my dear Sir, very truly 7our, EDWARD AKROYD.- The Constable (Ur. Joseph Shaw) occupied the chair. The R1ev, J.

The rev. gentleman devoutly hoped that God woulcd comfort our surviving countrymen and countrywomen in India. What a sone of widows and orphans did the land of India now present, and what a oontrast there was between happy England and that gloomy picture ! But even here how many weeping parents and mourning relatives awaited with diespairinghearts to hear tidings of those whom they dearly loved. (Hear.) The day of retribution would come when God wtotul3d avenge the fearful cruelties which had been Mr. J. BROOKE seconded the resolution, Mr. J. BATLEY, in supporting the resolution, expressed a hope that the cause of the reelion would be fully inquired into. He was also of opinion that India would never be properly governe0 until the East India Company had their power crushed. . he country ought to be under the entire control of our Government and Queen, and he thought that petitions should be presented to the Houses of Parliament in favour of this reform. (A.pplause.) A committee was appointed to receive subscriptions, The subscriptions were commenced forthwith, and sums amotunting to nearly 3001. were announced. CHRISTCHIURCIL A meeting was held in the Town-hall, Christchurch, Hampshire, on Monday, to raise fonds for the assistanco of the destitute sufferers by the mutiny in India ; the Mlayor, Mr. E. S. Elliott, in the chair. The first resolution was moved by Admiral WALCOTT, M. P., seconded by the Rev. M. BNNETT:- "That this meeting desires to express Its sympathy with ita feaow. countryrnen In India in the cruel an-: nnheard-of sufferinga they have so nobly oedured, and the deatiutaiou t whiehb o may of hthem are now reducei."1 The second resolution, moved by Mr. W, D, FARR, and seconded by Mr. H. DicKSNSo,y, was- " That this meoeng desires to assist the surviving sufferers and the widowa and orphaus of these who have fallen, eud to this end moat auzi'unsy entreatz the bhen volest contributions of the inhabltanto of the town and neigbboarhood." It was then agreed that a subscription should be commeonced. The meceting was well and respectably attended, and betweena SOI. and 9101, subscribed in the room. EDINBURGH. A meeting was held in the Counoil-chamber, Edinburgh, on Monday morning, to express sympathy and extend relief towards the sufferers by the Indian mutiny. About lO gentlemen attended, ineuding numerous Indian officers The LORD PROVOST, wbo presided, stated tlsat ho had delayed calling this meeting for some time owing to so many of the influential citizens being absent from town, but he had received representations, which he had yielded tO urging on him to call the citizens together even at thls vacant ieason. He had received a letter from the Lord-Advocate expressing regret at his inability to be presert, stating that he should have been glad of the opnortunity of expressing his strong sympathy vrith the ob3sects of the meeting, and his hope that Edinburgh on this occasionwould not fall short of its reputation for liberality, as no community in Britain owed more to India and had more reason to pay this tribute to the memory of those who had fallen in defence of our empire in the East. Mr. D. SaTIrri, writer to the signet, proposed the first resolution, which expressed profound sympathy -ith tho trils ndpriatinssuferd by our fellow-countrymen in d pnd en, wh tich was s,eonded by the Rev. G. D. C ALLEx, In- drer is tobeprompth an moved the second resolution, to the efectthat subscriptions should be immediately cram menced inspeeth c^iy,andthat the orsume thus raised should bsfe senttohed Lod eMayor of London, with the request that thisspirsitp would either forward them to India along with the contributions now being collected in London, or dispense thiem to sufferers who may have arrived in this country, as should be foundl most expedient. The latter alternative, he said, had been rendered all the miore necessary to provide for as it was considered that the terms of the resolution adopted at the great meeting in the Mansionh1i-1se London, entailed on thie Lord Mlayor the necessity of sen,"ng all the money collected in the meitropolis out to India,- Dr. Maclagan remarked that, eampelled as we were with u.'sw7illing eye to contemplate sceneg of butchery and bloodshe,'l from which the ver ' vultures of the desert maight turn: with disgust, -we cou d (10 Ittje but call upon our rulers to', be prompt and emphatic in the work of retributin.

With such a hope, ,ie waded, let us " make medicine of our great revenge to care this deadly ill." Kr. F. ANDERSON, Madras Civil Service, seconded the motion. Colonel GEDDES, Edinburgh Militia Artillery, In moving n committee to carry out the resolutions, said he had been a regimental officer in Bengal for 34 years, and though it was his good fortune always to be with a European regiment, still he had seen the native army under every eircumstance of warfare and military service; and he maintained fearlessly, notwithstanding all that had been said to the contrarv, that The officers of the native branch did as fairly, honestly, and perseveringly support the discipline of the army as did the officers of any army he ever came across. He denied that the causes ofI this mutiny were in any way attributable to them. There might have been less " pipeclay" in tho Bengal service than elsewhere, hut all the eseential prin' ciples of discipline were as well maintained by the officers of that army as by the offiesrs of any other. They must leek baok to the souarce of these calamities for 30 years or I so, and to the records of the administration of Lord W. Bentinok, one of whose acts, in 1828 or 1829, they would find was to abolish corporal punishment among the natives, while It was retained among the Europeans, and that on the ground of the superior docility, trustworthiness, and fidelity of the native soldiers, and in order to get high caste men to enter the service, who would not submit to tho risk of degradation by the lash. While his old friends and comrades had been thus assailed aS causing the mutiny by their laxity of discipline, he could not but stand up In their defence. It was not lax discipline, but bad governmont they must blamae ; and, though some errors may havo been committed by the officers of the Bengal army, still he would say, using a liberal construction of the poet's words: - " It to their share some human ercors fall, " Think of theL- deeds and sufferluga, and forgiro thom a1L1 After appointing the necessary organization for the Vurpose tho meeting separated, the sum of tho contribations previous to and at the meeting being 1,2001. to 1,5001. JERSEY. On Satarday last a public meeting was held at St. HElier's, to devise measures for promoting subscriptions in aid of the funds for the relief of the sufferers from tho mutiny in India." His Excellency, MIajor-General Mundy, Lientenant-Governor, presided; and the attendance ineluded several of the influential gontlemen of the island, and a number of ladies. The Cii&rr=tIB , in opening the proceedings, drew a vivid picture of the horrible atrocities perpetrated by the savage Sepoys on our countrymen and countrywomen, and made a warm appeal to the sympathies of the inhabitants, not on the ground that any amount of money subscribed could compensate the sufferers for the losses that they had sustained,or blot out of their minds the horrors of the mutiny, but in order to relieve them in their present position,and to enable many of them to return to their native land. The Very Rev. the DzA?, moved the first resolution:- That thismeestng, animated with feelings of the utmo3t horror and detestatien at the atrocitle3 that have been inflicted by the rebels In India upon our helpless felow-coun trymen, their wives,andchildren, and earne3tly prayIng that the day of retribulion Is le hnmd, desires to espre Ite deep sympathy with the sufferers from the rivases which bave so wantonly been oommltteo upon their piraons and property.n He spoke at length upon the assumed causes of this revolt, the horrible atrocities, unparalleled in bistory, perpetrated by the Sepovs, and more particularly by that fiend Nerna ;ahlb, andterminated his address by calllng upon the assembly tosubscribe liberally towards the fund, and in wishing good speed to the " army of justice and retribution" nowv on its way. The resolution was carried unanimously. Colonel LE COUTEUr, Queen's Aide-dc-Camp, proposed,- "Thattitsl meeting recoguizes Itasa duty incumbentupon aU who rosmesi the means to some to the relief of those who hare been so cruelly and base pollated. That asubseriptlon be therefore Immediately entered Into for that purpose." He expressed his deep sympathy for the sufferers, and said he felt assured that the inhabitants would generously come forward to relieve the sufferings and miseries of the many victims of this fearful outbreak. The British officers in India had not, to his knowledge, acted towards their soldiers in a manner to deserve the treatment they had met with from the hands of those fiends, and the ladies still less sa. Judge NCOoLr,u seconded the resolution, and called upon all to aid in swelling the subscription list. The resolution was rcaried unanimously, and a committee was appointed to carry out the resolutions. The ladies were also invited to join in promoting the object of the meeting. On the motion of General TouzEL, a vote of thanks was awarded to the chairman for his kindness in having consented to occupy the chair on the present occasion. A subseription list was immediately opened, and beforo tne meeting separated 1511. was subscribed. LEEDS. A requisition is in the courseoof signature in this town, asking the Mayer to convene a public meeting of the inhabitants to raise subscriptions in aid of the sufferers from the Eepoy mutiny in India. There is no doubt that his worship will readlly comply with the prayer of the requisitionists. A collection in aid of this fand was made on Sunday last in the new church of St. Peter's, Notting-hill. The amount received was 1151. The sermons were preached by the Rav. J. Adams, M.A., incumbent, and the Rev. H. Harding, MXA.
OLD ROCHESTER-BRIDGE. ROCHESTER, TUESDAY. A series of grand explosions took place this afternoon at the old Rochester-bridge, for the purpose of demolishing the remaining portions of that huge structure, the handsome bridge which now spans the Medway having been for some time open to the public, The idea of employin~ the troops of the Royal Engineers in the removal of~ e oeiginated with Colonel E. Sandham. the director of the Royal Engineers' establishment at Chatbam, who consideredit would bo unwise to alow such a rare opportunity to pass for the men of the Royal Sappers and Miners to take part in the destruotion of the works, especially as the Royal Engineers had been so successful in the siege operations for destroying the great docks at Sebastopol. On the proposal being mado to the authorities permission was at once accorded, and for nearly 12 months past the Royal Engineers have been engaged, with scarcely any intermission, in sapping and destroying various portions of the ancient structure, the works being carried on under the superintendence of Cap. tain W. H. Noble, R. E., an officer of great inteligence and experience. The old bridge, which has beenbuilt nearly five centuiies, originally consisted of 10 large arches, resting on nine piers and two abutments; the Royal Engineers have already succeeded in destroying five arches, three pierq, and the abutments; but, owing to the immense strength and solidity of the structure, the operations have necessarily been carried on but slowly. Six piers, five ;rches, and nine "starlings" remained to be destroyed, and nearly the whole of these were successfully blown to pieces this afternoon in the presence of the Earl of Romney, the wardens and assistants of Rochester-bridge, LieutenantGeneral Sir Charles W. Pasley, E.B., besides a large number of officers of the Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery, the whole of the operations being under the superintendence of Colonel H. Sandhamn, assisted by hIajor F. C. Hassard, Royal Engineers. The operations commenced this afternoon by the destruction of the lower portion of No. 4 arch from the Rochester side, which was thrown down by means of two charges of gunpowder lodged in one of the voussoirs of each haunch of the arch, and two charges lodged in the voussoirs next the keystone. A charge of 301b. of gunpowder placed nuder the soffit of the keystone of the upper added portions of the arch was next exploded, the effect of which was to throw down the whole of that portion of the arch acted upon. The troops next proceedec to destroy the third arch in a similar manner. Nine charges of 41b. each were placee' in the voussoirs of the haunch, and also nine of lUb. each in the vonssoirs next the keystone of the old portion of tho arch before the bridge was widened. These charges were fired simultaneously by means of tho voltaic battery, the result being that the arches were destroyed, and the masonry of whioh they were composed entirely detached. The finest explosions of the day, however, were reserved for the latter part of the operations, when three of the massive piers were blown down by means of several charges of gunpowder, weighing in the aggregate about 1,0001b. In order to facilitate the operation, the Sappers and miners had previously excavated a shaft in each of the piers to be destroyed, which was sunk to a depth of about 30 feet. Each of the shafts was about four feet square, and at the base projected a number of galleries, in which were deposited the large quantity of gunpowder required for the explosions. In the third pier, which was t3e first blown up, 4001b. weight of gunpowder was laid in two charges, each containing 2001b. The galleries were then firmly closed by means of '- tamping." The second pier had likewise 4001b. of gunpowder placed in the galleries, also in two charges, and the first pier 2661b. At the sound of the bugle the charges in the third pier were ignited by means of the voltaic battery, worked by Captain EH. Y. D. Scott, Royal Engineers. The effects of the explosions were most complete, the large mass of earth and masonry, containing, it was computed, about 20,000 cubic feet, being lifted up from its foundation and scattered into fragments, retaining not a vestige of its original form. The second pier, after a short delay in fixing the wires, was destroyed in the same manner, the shook of the explosions being felt at considerable distance, the ground being sensibly shaken as if from the effects of a distant earthquake; the river, also, being considerably agitated, The fist pier, which contained as large a mass of stones and earth as the other two, was the last destroyed, several of thehuge stones of which it was composed being hurled to some distance. The whole of the operations were highly successful, and, notwithstanding the immense nuimber of spectators present, not a single accident oocurred, During the operations an body of the Royal Enlners not engaged inwthe explosions, were emploted informing f bridge of rafts with General Blanchard's pontoons across the vneway, some distance above the old bridge. The river at that spot is very wide, which prevented the bridge being extenlded from shore to shore, lt vas however, carried cut a considerable distance into the river, and when coin. pleted the whole of the troops, together with a large body of spectators, took up their position upon it for the purpose of witnessing the operations at the old bridge. the Royal Sappers and Miners will continue their operations at the brid unstil the whole of that sture 15 en- tiely remnoved,
THB LONDON MANOHESTER, ANY) WAREHOUSE COMPANY (LI'IbllD,)sr A special meeting of this compe- the comlpany's warehouss, 91 4 ra YAseld on Monday at th compan'wauo rethouose; 9 W ingl-street, to take into consideration the proprf,7, ' sso7ig h omay ThecharePwas tae .Y M. COSteker, one of the directors. The comoany, 1t~.nculu be stated was formed in Taun. Ray, 18K6, iti an assumed capitia of so6,00Q., in 5,000 shamesof Ifl each, and upon which 81. per share has been aid, The direotors were Mr. Costeker, Mr. L)wry, Mr. ofeland, Mr. Cramping, Mr. Sharlard, and Mr. Laihley. Of these Messrs. Cramping and Lowry resigned before the completion of the regLstration, and the company has practically been carried on by Messrs. Costeker, Holyland, Sbarland, and Laishley. At a recent meeting, at which the half-yearly report of the directors was not adopted, the report set forth that a loEs of 29,0001. bad been incurred during the 18 months' trading, and that the liabilities of the company at that time amounted to 20,000.', while the asets, consisting principally of stock, fixtures, leases, and book debts, were repreEented at 35,0001., subject to realization. The rsrincipal digsentient shareholder at the time was Mr. G. Warding, the holder of 125 shares. Sinoe that time 3Mr. Harding has published a pamphlet which, among other things, contains the following charges :-L That the directors had expended the whole of the capital, as by prior arranement, in the purchse of a banl-rupt's stock, being compelled to raise money on loan from Messrs. Qailter and others In order to commence the trading; 2. That having purchased )ares and fixtures at tho cost of 10,4001, those leases and fixtures represented assets in the balance-sheet of Christmas last of 12,6001., being an increase on cost of 2,2001.; that tho market for these securities, which appeared to have risen so conveniently at Christmas, had subsequently experienced a more than equivalent depresslon, for it appeared that the loss on leases and fixtures between December, 1856, and Juno, 1857, was 6.0621., they having In that intermediate time sold for 1,1861. what they estimated in December, 1856, at 7,248l. 3. That after having in February last confirmed the resoiution that 5 per cent should be diaided among t.ho shareholdera out of profits, the directors sacrificed, without notice, 80,0001. worth of stock, and the business for which the company was incorporated ; 4. That losses to an enormous amount had been thereby occasioned ; and that the preSent nosition of the compauy was really this-the total loss of its Daid tip capital, ana a pros. pectof a further call of 21. per share. After some preliminary observations, Mr. BARTLETr, a shareholder, inquired what the directors intended to do with respect to the callsupon share held by Mr. Holyland, tlhe late managing director of the company ? Knowing him to be now a professional accountant, having a large income, he was persuAded that if the compnany would take steps to make him a bankrupt a sam of ,001. or 1,4001. could ho obtained from him. lr. Holy. and was the original concoctor of this unfortunate conee rn, and although he was now said to be a man of straw it washis aopinion that money could be obtained from him Sr. HARLAS1D said, the directors would take any course in the matter which was generally acceptable. A SARZEHOLDER was glad to hear this. Mfr. Holyland had been allowed to escape too much already. A SHAREuOLDER asked why the directors should ever have trsted a man of straw without a shirt? Mr. SnARL&ND.-Why don't you ask the same respecting one of your friends who has been trusted? ilr. PROuD proposed a resolution that the company be wound up voluntarily. Mr. Proud proceeded to read a statement of the position of the company, which he believed warranted an opinion that a sum of U,0001. might be returned to the shareholders. Mr. SHARL.ND also made a statement respecting the position of the company. The company had still stock to the amount of 11,0001. They had also good book debts to the amount of 7,0001. or 8,0001. Thecompany's trade debts did not now exceed 4001. There were certain loans by directors and their friends, which it was proposed to pay the last. There was no chance of any one succeeding in obtainiDg a winding-up order in the Court of Bankruptcy. If the company were woundup voluntarily there would probaby he a smail surplus; if not, the shareholders would probably be called upon for a further payment of 21. per In reply to further questions the CHATRMirAN said, the company was liable upon 1,5001. of its bills, as well as upon the claims referred to. Mr. BARTLETT wished to know whether the directors intended to answer Mr. Harding's pamphlet? If it remained unanswered, he must say it was his opinion that the sharekolders had been most grossly defrauded. The alleged losses upon the leases were not satisfactory. What wore the directors about to allow such losses ? They had paid the company's solicitor, Mx. Mackarell, a large sum to look after their interets, and he and the directors ought to hatve done Mr. CosTErZR said, not so much as a farthing of the company'smoney had passed into his hands, and he was prepared to answer Mr. Harding's charges. A SHARtEouzR, .-An answer must not be evaded. But for seeing the names of Mr. Quilter and Mr. Sharland I should never have joined the company. Mr. CoSTEr;ER-I repeat I am prepared to answer the pamphlet. A SHIREHOLDER.-But wiU you ? Mr. COSTEEZR.-Yes. Assertions have been made in the pamphlet that are most villanons. The pamphlet is a mass of misrepresentation from beginning to end. Any alleged facts contiined therein arc garbled. Mr. S ARLAsnDsaid, he agreed with all Mr. Costeker's assertions. The directors might have been unfortunate, but he could honestly say that they had not received a farthing of the company's money. The minutes of the company might set forth that a sum of 2,0001. should be paid to Mr. Cos.-ker, and it might have been intended that such sum should be paid. The fact, however, was that the money was given up. There was another minute to that effect. Mr. HARDING.- I deny that. After some discussion, the hooks were called for to prove Mr. Harding'sstatements. They were produced, but not referred to. It was also agreed that an undertaking on the part of Mr. Costeker to reply line by line to the charges made against the directors should be at present accepted, it having been admitted that an explanation given in respect to a sum of 1,0001. was satisfactory. After some further discussion the proposition to wind up voluntarily was put, when Mr. HARDING proposed, as an amendment, that the meeting be adjourned for the purpose of first obtaining the reply to his charges. A SsAREHOLDESS suggested that the best course would be for the directors to return the shareholders 25 per cent. on their ehares. (Laughter.) Another SHARtnoLDZR.-We ought to have all our mnoney. Mr. GRANT said that, being from England, he was led to believe that the shares stood at a premiim ; that he had received au order for the 5 per cent, dividend ; and that he was induced by the report.of the directors to take further shares. He had been regularly taken in. fr. SHARLAND observed that at the time referred to he andthe other directors believed the concern tobeprosperous. Mr. PHILPS preferred a voluntary winding-up; he had a great dread of the Court of Bankruptcy. A SHAREHOLDER observed that of late the directors of public companies seemed to close all discussion just as they pleased by holding before the eyes of the shareholders the fearful eff.cts of the Bankruptcy Court, and that k7is Times newspaper was deservedly laughing at them in consequence. Zr. IHARDIXO referred to some charges brought against himself by the directors, and read a letter from Mir. Pullein in contradiction of statements made at the last meeting by the chairman. The conduct of some of the diectors was Mir. h SiuRL.LD.-Not half so infamous as yours. It was ultimately carried unanimously that the company shouldbhe wound up voluntarily, reserving to the shareholders the right of obtaining a satisfactory reply to Mr. Hasrdings charges against the directors.
FRENCH SISTERS OF CHARITY IN INDIA.-The Couri-ierde ljonsgives the following accountof the dangers incurred by several French lay nuns in India during the late disturbances :-' The religious establishment of Jesuset-Marie at Fourvire had several of its sisterhood imperi1ed at Meerut, Dolhi, Sealcote, and Agra by the Indian insurrection. It is only by the last mail that intelligence has been received respecting them in letters written to their superior, which show that a portion of them, at least, have escaped. All these holy women were at the head of schools for young girls, English and native. ThDes who were at Mleerut succeeded in escaping through the conflict, murders, and conflagration with a part of their pupils, some English ladies, and about 50 males, officers aud civilians to a valley in the mountains of Thibet, where they are, it appea=p, in tolerable security, for the party being well anmed is strong enough to defend against the insurgents the defile leading to their asylun. The 'dight from Sealcote was marked by moat dramatic incidents. The evening before the rising, some of the natives, through ratitude tor the attention and kindness which the sisters had alwaysshown to their children, came secretly to inform them they would do Vell to leave ithe place as promptly as possible with their pupils, as the insurrection was to commence the next morning at break of day, and the insurgents had resolved to kill every European. The sisters at once procured cars, and loaded them with their property and with their youngest pupils, whose weakness would have retarded their precipitate flight. Then, profiting by the shades of night, they left the town for a fort some leagues distant, where they hoped to find refuge. Unfortunately, whether it was that the warning given them was too late, or that the fugitives had not hurried on with sufficient rapidity, or that the natives had advanced the moment of the insurrection, the sistes were overtaken when about half way by a troop of the insurgents, who, on finding their convent ebandoned, had pursued them. The poor sistes, on seeing this horde of miscreants approaching, abandoned their cars and baggage In the niddle of the road to be pillaged, and hurried away to take refuge in an Isolated house which stood n,ear, Bt their pursuers soon surrounded the building, and, bursting in, murdered in presence of the peer sisters and the chidren several English persons, women and men, who had also hurried to the house for safety. They then rushed at the sisters, and, with horrible imprecations, threatened to make them and their pupils share the Rame fate, if they did not at once declare where their property was to be found. The unfortunate women protested that they had nothing in the world but what they had left in the cars on the high road, and that they willingly gavd up that property. As, however, other pillagers had already carried off whatever was precious from the cars, the insurgents in the house were about to execute their threat of killing every human being in the building, when a voice cried out that the public treasure had been found. They then rushed from the house to obtain their share in the booty, and the sisters, without losing a moment, placed the youngest children on their shoulders, and, taking the others by the hand, roceeded as rapidly as they could towards the fort, wbichi they at last reached, and obtained a shelter in the midst of other fugitives of every age and oondition. It is impoassible to praise too highly the devoted. rnes of these poor women, who risked without besitation their own lima to save thoa, of the ohildign confided to t-bofr care."
HAMPTON cQar7r PAL XcE. TO THE EDITOR OF TaE TIMES. Sir,-I beg lexvo tohadyotsherewithoopyof arnteplyto a communi-ction received from the First Commlloner of Her Majesty's Works and Building in answer to my letter of the lth inst., by which I forwarded to that office copy of a letter addresed byme to some of the nevspspers, cooplain. Ing of tncourteous behaviour experienced from some of the officlalsat aLmpton Court Palace bya Mndy who had omitted to include her pass-ol in the articles belonging to our party, and which were deposited by me at the foot of the stalrcagj on the occasion of a visit to the palace oa the 30th ult. You will observe that the tenour of the letter is such as would imply that the annoyance to which visitors are occasionally exposed is to be asrbed, not to the officals, but to " the misconduct of persons who, from their station, mlght be expeoted more especially to conform to the simple rules laid down, and thus offer a good example to others." As regards our party, I distinctly deny that any misconduct took place on our part, and I only regret that insinuations of this sort should be made in a matter in which a general principle is involved. I am, Sir, your most obedient servant. J. 0. BFRGENDAHL "Office of Works, &c., S.W., Sept. 19. "Slr,-I am directed by the First Commissioner of Her Majesty's Works &o, to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th lnst. enclosing copy of a letter signed "A Dutchman," whiob you say has been sentby you to a few of the principal Lordon newspapers, and ha3 appeared in the .Morning Herald. " In reply I am directed to acquaint you that immediately on the receipt of your letter of the 15th inst. strict inquiries were made as to the alleged misconduct of the offlcers in attendance at Hampton Court Palace; the principal warder, his assistant who was present on the occasion referred to, and the constable on duty on the staircase have been examined, and after the fullest investigation tho First Comm2ssioner cannot ascertain that these offlcers are fairly subject to the charge which has been brought agaAnet them. " I am further directed to state that every possible precaution has been taken to prevent the po.dbility of annoyauce or inoonvenience to persons desirous of visiting the State apartments and viewing the pictures at Hampton Court, and the strictest orders are given that the wardern and attendants shall show the utmost civility to tho vistors. As is usual at such collections, it is desired that xticks parasols, umbrellas, &a, should be deposited in the charge of an attendant, and an officer at the foot of the staircoe i3 intrusted with this duty. This regulation is notified to the phlbic in large letters painted on a notice bo.rd; this notice states that if such articles are taken up to the picture rooms persons thus disregarding the regulations will be tnrned back. In addition to this precaution visitors are verbaly requested to leave such articles in charge of the attendant. Still farther precautions are taken; another offioer, standing on the staircase, tells all persons who ascend that if they have any such articles with them they must go back and leave them. ' I would be impossible to do more, but, notwithstanding all this, there are somo peromns who will not attend to these ordinary and repeated directions, and who will act contray to them by secreting such articles. In each casa3 the warders have strict orders, on discovery, to request them to leave the rooms, and to take back their parasols, sticks, umbrellas, &c. Even this request is sometimes refused, and in that event the warders are instructed to remove euch persons from the picture galleries. This is a course which would be invariably pursued in any private galleries or in any public exhibition of pictures, and the First Commissioner sees no reason why it should be departed from at Hampton Court Palace. "Very few, in fact hardly any, complaints are made to [this office In relation to the conduct of the masses who visit the palace and gardens as places of recreation; but the First Commissioner regrets that representations are made in consequence of the misconduct of persons who, from their station, might be expected more especially to conform to the simple rules laid down, and thus offer a good example to others. In the case of such misconduct the offioers in attendance must discharge the duty with which they are intrusted; they are instructed to perform this duty with firmness and civility, and the First Commirsioner believes that these instructions are observed. This duty would not be imposed upon them if all thoce who visit plbces f publio resort which are open for the recreation and enjoyment of the public would conform to rules which are exhibited in distinct characters for their guidauce, and would obey directions which are assuredly not of an unroasonable character. "Tam, &e., " GEORGE RU89B LL4 J. C. Bergendahl, Esq. Assistant Secretary." 'Sir,-I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your communication, dated the 19thinst., in reply to mine of the 15th idem, by which I forwarded to you copy of a letter addressed by me to some of the London newspapers, relative to uncourteous behaviour experienced by a lady from some of the officials at Hampton Court Palace on the 30th ult. "I beg leave to state in reply that the grievance I complain of is not that sufficient precautions are not adopted to prevent visitors from infringing on the rules, but that if, by some accident, as in the case in point, a lady has either not noticed or misunderstood those rules, she should be treated with rudeness, and not be allowed to return to view the palace, after having corrected the oversight It appears to me that by permitting this to be done the officials would only be performing an act of civilty to which ladies are entitled, and thus prevent anycomplaints being made as to the conduct of the former. "I have only to repeat, as a proof that there was not the slightest intention on our pert to infringe upon the rules, that, with the exception of the parasol alluded to, all the prohibited articles in the hands of our party were deposited with the attendants nt the foot of the staircase. If the officials had allowed either the lady or myself to correct the mistake, and then return to view the apariimnts, the present complaint would not have been made. "I am, &e., " J. C. BERGENTDAB. " The Right Hon. Tho First Commissioner of Her Majesty' Work;, &c."
THE MEN MILLIMERS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-You ask, why we have man-milliners when the State wants soldiers,'and women employment s Certainly, it is not because any man:of Anglo-Saxon blood prefers in-door to out-of-door labour. London is recruated from the country, and its denizens are gathered into it from homes amid fox-covers and game-preserves, beside trout streams and moors, amid downs and under cliis by the sea. I met a little fellow yesterday (Sanday) walking far out in the conntry, an evident child of Cockayne, with a jockey's whip in' his hand as long almost as himself, and with a knob to it as big as a Newtown pippin. I repected the visionary horsemanship which that single reality solaced, of no use in any kiud of looomotion practised by the bearer, but exchanged for the yard-measure on one day out of soven to show the knightly longings within him. But this Tydides, if a shopman in 1857, may reasonably look, with industry and good conduct, to be a king of shop. men, and to have a shop of his own in 1867 or 1877. Wheress, if Tydides,'as an artillery driver-for which purpose noutre probably designed that dapper body and that mighty soul-gallops into action through colamns, cheoring the gans as they pass, in 1857, will Tydides be equaUy likely to command his own or any other troop in 1867 or 1877 ? Or will he not, if with a many-clasped modal he lives to retire in either of those years, think himself ratber for ttmate in becoming a hight porter to his friend AchiUles who has stuck to the shop? Are you prepared tc offer enlistment on the following terms?-Raiso (say) six battalions of 1,000 men each. Officer them, in the frst instance, from the half-pay list, give no bounty, and charge the recruit for his outfit (this will define a class). All soldiers who give proof on enlisting that they can read, write, and do accounts, to be eligible to become offioers. Allivacant commissions to ba filled up from the ranks for merit,-the chief merit being distinguished service in the face of the enemy. You may indst upon a higher standard of physical qualifications than that with which you must now be content. I firmly beieve that you may raise battalions, such as have not been seen since the days of Oliver Cromwell, upon these terms, to any extent that is conceivably requisite. You wiiU have to pay dearly for men at their own work as long as women aro not trained to perform all the work for which thetr sex quallfles them. If you want more women to be employed in shops, you. must see that women receive, much more generally than they do at present, sound instruction in arithmetic. Not one girl (lady or other) in 60 can do the common operations of arithmetic with neatness, certainty, and despatch. So far as attention has boen brought to bear upon improvement in the practical instruc. tion of girls it has natur-lly talen the direction of qualify. ing them for domestic service or for domestic management, But you have got mors women than society wants, cooks, houeremids, or wives, ad you cannot bring them into the general labour-mark-et without qualifying them for it. The attraction of the recrulting sergeant before the man-milllner should be sided by the ihpulse of the cheaner femal. - waw Dnmn u A coo"u
