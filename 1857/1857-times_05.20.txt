P IAMIETARY INTE *ENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, TUEDAY, MAY 19. The LORD CHaKCELLOR took his seat on tho woolsack at 5 o'clock. Petitions, praying for amendment in the Civil Service Suparannuation Act, were presented by the Earl of sg Bu from civil servants employed at the Admi. rulty; also by the Marquis of SsaGO, from Custom-house ofiEcrs at Westport; by the Brl of SHArMESIBURy, from cIvil servants at Hull, and from civil servants at Deal * also a petitlons from the vestry of the parish of St. George's.-mthe. kats prayin for a qualization of poor-rates throughout the metropOlIS; also from Romsey, for regulation of houses for sale of beer and cider. THE MARQUIS OF WESTMEATH AND THE " GLOBE." The Marqui of WESTMEATH solcited the attention of the House for a short time while he addressed to them a few words which, although relating to personal matters, atillhsd some connexion with a Bill that wes to come under discus. sion that evening. His attention had been called to an artiole of a most virulent character which had appeared in the Glo&e . newspaper of the previous evening, in which his name had been most unwarrantably brought before the public. That article contained statements which were not only fLll;o but libelous. With respect to the libel, that he should leave to be dealt with by the proper authority; but ho should take the earliest opportunity when the Matrimonial Cause3 BiU came under discussion, to make such statements as should completely contradict the composition which had been sent about by a lady who did him the honour to bear his name, and who, notwithstan!ding she had left his house 38 years ago, was still disinclined to leave her husband at peace. The statements in the Globe were founded upon a pamphlet which had been circulated among the newspapers and had been laid upon the tablms of all the clubs in London with the object or vilifying his (the Marquis of Westmeath's) character. He betged to give notice that when the Bil which was about tobe3 considered should arrive at the proper etage he would prove that the statements which had been made respecting him were not only' untrue, but were characterized by perjury and conspiracy, which could only have eistsed under the system which he trusted Parliament was about to abolish. EUROPEAN TROOPS FOR INDIA. Lord ELLENBOROUGH inquired whether in eonsequtene of the intelligence just received from India there .was any intention of reinforocing the army in that country with Earopean troops? Lord PANMURE said, the accounts from India were not such as to create in the mind of the Government a belief that there was any absolute necessity for special measures; but, as the expedition to China consisted of troops originally destined for India, four other regiments had been ordered to proceed to the latter country in the course of the next five weeks. The reason for the delay was that troops sent out earlier than the second week in June would arrive iu India at the most unhealthy season. If upon the arrival of those troops there shoald be any necessity for imreased European force the regiments which they were intended to relieve would remaia out there for a short time longer. Lord ELLEN2BOROUGE wished to know the number of recruits sent out from England to regiments in India, Lord PANMURE replied that the number of recruits to be sent out in June was 400. LADY BULWER LYTTON. Lord LYNDHURST begged to make a, short explanation in reference to an entry which appeared upon the votes of the House of Commons of that morning. The entry he referred to related to a petition from Lady Brlwer Lytton, complaining that a package of documents had been lost to her through the miconduct of a public functionary. He would briefly state the circumstances of the cas eas far as he (Lord Lyndhurst) was concerned with them, as he shonld be distressed if their lordships could suppose that he had been guilty of any incivility to any lady -- conduct which he believed was quite foreign to his disposition and character. (Hear, hear.) The lady had transmitted to him a very voluminous packet, containg many sheets of letter paper written over in a very sma.ll hand, comprising the statement to which she referred in her petition. The packet was dated from Llangollen. After the lapse of two months the lady asked for the return of her papers, but having by some accident mislaid her note he (Lord Lyndhurst) wrote to her a letter, addressed to LLangoUen, informing her that if she would have the kindness to send to his house the packet should be given to her messenger. He accordingly sealed up the packet and gave it to his porter, with instructions to deliver it to any person who was sent by Lady Balwer Lytton to receive it. lioon after, however, he received a letter from the lady, stating that she had not received the packet, and surmising that it had fallen into other hands and that it had been opened and the contents purloined. Whether that surmise was correct he could not tell, but he was satisfied that he had acted correctly in the matter, and he hoped their lordships would acquit him of any want of politeness in the traLsaction. (lRear, hear.) THE CONTINUOUS SERVICE SEAMEN. Earl TALBOT asked whether the Government intended to discharge seamen who had entered for continuous service? It was, he conceived, of the highest importance to maintain faith with those men, and therefore he rejoiced to find that it had beeu stated in the other House of Parliament that no breach of faith was contemplated. At the same time he was rather puzzled by a circular which had been issued by the Admiralty on the 13th inst., directing that ordinary seamen and boys entered for continuous service should be discharged. HRe was anxious to know the real intentions of the Government upon this mnatter. Earl GRANVILLE replied that there had been no breach of faith between the Government and the seamen employed in Her Majesty's service. It was formerly the practice to allow old and partially disabled seamen, who wished to retire to do so upon payment of 101. Under the new regulations those men would be permitted to leave the navy, although they might have entered into a continuous serviceo egagemuent, wnthout paying any money whatever. He thought that the change should be regarded by the seamen as a privi. lege, rather than a grievance. DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES BILL. The LORD ClIANCELLOR rose to move theosecond reading of this Bill. He said that the measure was one of the very deopest in terest to society in general. Their lordships would recollect tL t last year a BiU nearly similar to the present passed that li.ase, but at a period of the session too late to allov of its being passed in the other House of Parliament. In consequence of that failure he introduced during the short session which took place in the early part Of the presant year a Bil founded upon the same principles, but differing somewhat in detail from the measure to which he now invited the attention of their lordships. The progress of that Bil, however, like that of many others, wan necessarily arrosted by the dissolution, and it now became Isis duty therefore to invite their lordships again to the consideration of this most important subject. Nothing would induce him to submit a BiUl which he believed would have the slightest tendency to shake the confidence of the country in the pormanency, if not the absolute indissolubility of the mariage tie. He believ ed that the fact of that tie being absolutely binding through life, except in very extreme cases, was the foundation of some of the best in. terests and feelings of society. Those who had paid attention to this subject would bo aware of what had been the cour8e of feeling, if he might so express himself, and the course of law and habit upon the question of divorce. Before the Reformation, when the Roman Catholic religion prevailed in this country as in the rest of Europe, marriage was considered as being absolutely indissoluble. It was regarded as a sacrament of the church, or an union so sanctioned by the highest authority of the church as to be incapable of being touched or affected by any human tribunal. That state of things, though founded in some respects upon good sense-viz., upon the great im. portance of considering marriage indissoluble except in extreme cases-lod to inconveniences of a very distressing character, and the consquence was that, the absolute in. dissolubility of marriage being incompatible with the general feelings of society, a number of the most extraordinarv devices, ridiculous in the extent to which they werecarried, were hit upon in order to get out of the difficulty. Although it was a tenet of the Roman Catholic church that marriges were indissoluble, yet it was at the same time el that there might have been certain circumstances .receding the marriage that rendered it invalid; that there might have been, for instance, what was called a pre-contract, or a contract for a prior marriage, imairiing the validity of the subsequent union which it was desirable to diseolve. So, again, marriages could be contracted only where there was no consanguinity or affinity between the parties to render them illegal in the eve of the church; and to such an extent was that carried that remote cousins could not marry without a dispensation having been urevionsly obtained, and a mtarriage could be dissolved asid a divorce, as we would call it, prcue, by showingthat there was bome remote connexionbwn the parties which rendered the union invalid. Lord Coke related that in one case a marriage waos disso8lved fbecaue the husb,Aand had soo t~heRefrmaionwas totaly to change the feeliug of the community upon this subject. Whereas, prior to that event the doctrine of the church had been that marriage was a sacrament and indissoluble, the opinion of the Reformers was that there was nothing of a sacramental nature connected with marriage, which, though under the sanction of religion, was a mere civil contract, and ought to be dealt with in the same way as other civil contracts-viz., by considering what was most for the interests of the Darties ooncerned. Accordingly, when Henry VIII. and 9dward VI issued the commissions, which they were authorized to issue to certain divines and laymen for the purpose of framing a new coda of laws for the regulation of the community, under the influence of the reformed church, the commissioners, presided over by Archbishop Craniner, enumerated in their work, entitled, efnorMcatio LegumAnglicanarum a great nurmber of causes for which they thought divorce ought to be granted. Adnltery on the part of either spouse was one of those causes, unjustifiable desertion was another, violent hatred a third, and there were several other cases in whicb, according to the opinion of those early reformers, divorce mnight be prudent and advisable. Their recommendations were never embodied in the form of law, but they showed what were the opinions aud feelings upon this subject of the first reformera, ecclesiastical as wol as civil. Moreover, they were, to a great extent, in harmony with the feelings of the commanity, n te consequence was that soon after the publication of theRe arsaio eginthedotrieswhch t ropuned thenJs tey id sot ecam la, wee pa ciayate divorce 4 mewnd et thono. The question then arose whether, when the Ecclesiastical Cucrts had granted r divorce, it was competent to the partiea to remarrywhether, in fact, a livorce 2 mensa et thom amounted to a dissolution of the marriage or not. A commissibn was Issued to certain functionaries to inquire what was the effect of such a divorce, and the commissioners reported that it dissolved the marriage. In the meanwhile, however, the Mlarquis of Northampton had decided the question for himself by contractiug a second marriage; and eventually, in order to mnake the matter all right, an Act of Parliament was passed confirming what had been done as being legaL This indicated that the opinion of our first reformers was that the Ecclesiastical Courts had it in their power absolutely to dissolve marriage so as to enable the parties to marry again. There was a circumstance connected withtheproceedings ofthosecourtswhichstrongly confirmed that view of the case. It was this-that in a divorce a mcnsd et thoro the parties were required to enter into a bond that they would not marry again, implying that but for that security the nature of the proceeding was such as would enable them to contract another marrsage. Irl that state of the law a case arose at the end of the reign of Elizabeth in which the contrary doctrine seemed to be held. The case was that of a Mr. Folambe, and it was then held that the effect of a divorce obtained in the Ecclesiastical Courts was not to enable the parties to marry again. He need not trouble their lordships by going through the three or four cases which happened during the 17th century-the cases of Lord Rcos, the Countess of Mansfield, and others-in which, divorces having first been obtained in the Eccleaiastical Courts, Acts of Parliament were subsequently passed to enable the parties to re-enter the marriage state. In two cases which occurred during the same wperiodi no proceedings at all were taken in the Ecclesiastical Courts, but thie marriages were dissolved and the parties permitted to marry again by the simple passing of Acts of Parliament. These precedents governed the practice of the whole of the last century, being followedf more rarely in the early portion of it, and more freely afterwards. Erom 1715 to 1775 there were six Acts passed dissolving mrge. From 1775 to 1800 the number considerably increased, and amounted to two or three annualy. In the first half of the present century there bad been two a-year. From the time when it was universally acknowledged tbat divorce by the Ecclesiastical Courts did not dissolve the vinculum of marriage about 200 Acts had passed enabling parties, on account of the adultery of the wife, and, in some very few instances, on account of the adultery of the husband, to marry again. That indicated sufirciently the necessity of some remedy for the wron of the husband whose wife had committed adultery, wbich was denied by the law as administered in the Ecclesiastical Court The question ws how far the feelng of the country in favour of such a remedy was a reasonable feeling, and one to which the Legislature ought to listen. He had set out by stating that he thought no measure could be more injurious than one which tended to shake the soldity of marriage and the strength of the marriage tie. It was observed by a most able judge and most powerful reasoner, Lord Stowell, that "the knowledge that persons united in marriage must continue husbands and wvives often made them good husbands and wives, for necessity was a powerful master in teaching the duties which it imposed." To every word of that he subscribed, and he thought anyone would be acting very unwisely for the interests of the community who proposed a measure which would at all weaken that principle. rut all experience showed that when marrie was held to be indissoluble in cases of the adultery of the wfe, some subterfuge was resorted to in order to supply the defect of law in Roman Catholc times, by pretending that the marriage was invald, and recently by the parties obtaining a private Act to give the rehef which the law could not give. It was a state of things which had been often complained of, and led, in 1550, totisuinga RoYal commission to inquire into the whole subject. That commission was directed to persous of the greatest eminence-to the Lord Chief Justice (Campbell), Dr. Lushington, Lord Beaumont, Mr. Walpole, Vice-Chanoellor Wood, Mx. Bouverie, and Lord Redesdale. They made a report two years afterwards, and the course whichthe recommendedtheirlordshipswere asked to adopt in the Bilwhich he had the honour of submitting to them. The commissioners recommended that whereas the practice had been growing for a century and a-half or two centuries of invariably allowing the husband an Act of Parlia ment to dissolve the marriage if adultery on the part of the wife were proved, that state of things should no longer continue, but the law should be made to adapt itself to the practie and what had beern shown to be the wants of the community, and that a competent tribunal should be created, to do that which the Legislature had heretofore been in the habit of doing. The main object of this Bill was to constitute a court to decree as a matter of right that rehef in favour of persons who had just matter of complaint, which could now only be obtained by means of an Act of Parliament. The commissioners recommended that the court should be constituted of a judge from the Court of Chancery (a Vice-Chancellor), a judge from a court of common law, and an ecclesiasical judge. Substantially those recommendations were ado ted in the Bill, except that, as these questions had come before the highest Court, their lordships! House, he proposed that the court should be constitute:, not of a Vice-Chancellor, but of the Lord Chan. celor, not of a puisne judge, but of one of the chief justices, and of the judge of the proo Court of Proite. at the close of the last century, in 1798, Lord Loughborougb, for the pirpoepreventig gusina applicatons to their lord,hi sI _ouse for divore, established certain standing orders which had been acted upon ever since, and, according to those standing orders, no Bill for divorce could be read a second time unless there were laid upon the table the proceedings in the ecclesiastical court, whereby divorce had been obtained from that court on the ground of adultery, and further, unless the party suing for divorce had established a pVim4fa.ej title by having brought an action.of crsm coc. against the alleged adulterer, snd obtained a verdict. With regard to the procedings by action of c-im con. they were dispensed with if ciroumstances rendered it impossible the actiOn could have been brought. The consequence of these regulations was, that the whole of those disgusting and disagreeable questions had to be inquired into three separate imes before the ultimate remedy could be obtained; for the proceedings in the ecclesiastical court were conducted according to the particular forms of that court, the action for crimr con. was brought in one of the superior oourts of common law, and tried im the ordinary way by a jury, and when the suppliant came to their lordships, House the whole case had to be proved over again by witnesses examined ava vsoce at the bar. To the investigation of the question on three different oocasions there was the grave objection, if no other, that such complicated proceedings were too ex nsive for the pockets of any but the richest sufferers, anathat relief was put beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest classes. -He proposed, in lieu of those triplicate proceedings, to thoroughly investigate the matter once for all, and he further proposed, instead of au independent inquiry by the ecclesiastical court, to inquire on vied voce evidence, except in special cases, and by a trial by jury. He thought that would be the best, the cheapest, and the most expeditious mode, and the mode which would secure the greatestchanceofgivingtsatbfaction andarrivingattthe truth. He proposed that on the husband complaining that his wife had ben unfaithful to him he might come before the new tribu-nal,and on establishing his case, and establishing also the fat that there had been no improper conduct on his part, he should be entitled to obtain at oncea decree which would give him the same relief as a private Act of Parliament now afforded him. He (the Lord Chancellor) had received letters from various persons complaining that the measure did not go far enough. There were many cases, it was said, short of the adultery of the wife, in which the hubadOught to be entitled to relief. To those applications he had not thought it dedirable to listen. Questions, for example, had been raised as to how far marriage was to be considered a subjeot on which the positive rule of Sri-pture prescribed what ought to be done. There were those 'who thought that, except for positive adultery, divorce should never he permitted. TIhere were others who would give the text of Scripture a larger acceptatioo. He did not pretend to discuss the propr moe ofinterpreting the passages inqus tion; hut of this he was persuaded, that if this Bill was ever to pass, the good feelinig of the country would require, whatever might be the correct interpretation of those passqages, that, in the interests Of the cOnimunity, they should be construed in the strictest mode. (Hear, hear.) For that reasOn he had not listened to the suggestions to which he had juest referred. Another question of a dlifferent natare had also arisn. It hga been the invable practice in their lordshipS! Hous to grant to a husband complaining of and establishng the adultery of his wife a private Act of Parliment, setting him free from the Martrage contract. But the same rule had not been ap hied to the wife complafromt of the adultery of her hus and. Their lordshspehfo oceaionallY granted a divorce at the instance of the Wife complaining of the adultery of her hup - band ;but thoew cases had been extremely rare. It had ever been the feeling of that House-indeed, it was a feeling COmmon to mankind in general- that the effect of adultery on the part of the husband was very different from thatzofagdulteryon thedpart ofthe wife. Itwaspossiblefr a wife to pardon a husband who had committed adultery hut it was hardly Possihle for a husband ever really to, pardon a wife, and therefore it was that in their practic yin that House their lordships had alwaYs mnade a great deis tinction betweesi the two cases. The only instances where marriage h-Ad been dissolved at the instance of the wife were such as had been accmpanied by somespecial cirumagtesa, u xmle sicstosauteyo h sunc- such, fior exaniple, ssincestu-ou_sa-d`ulte-r-y- -o-nthe part of the husband. In the Bill which he introduced last session that was the only case in which he proposed that there should be a divorce at the instance of the wife. That Bill was referred to a select oommittee of their lordships' House, and that subject was very much discussed both in the committee and in the, House. Some of their lordships thought there were two or three other cases in which the privilege of divorce mi ht be granted to the wife as well as to the husband, and thosehe had introduced into the present Bill. Two of those were incestuous adultery and bigamy, and another was the case where the adultery had been coapled on the part of the husband with such cruelty as would have entitled the wife to a divorce a measd et thoro even if there had been no adultery. When the Bill was before the House last year it would be in their lordships' recoullection that the right rev. prelte (the Bishop of oxford) introduced a clause to the effect that in case of the dissolution of the marriage the adulterer should never be at liberty to mary the adulteress. mhen that proposition was made he (the aLrd Chancellor) raised, he believed, his solitary voice against it. It was carried nevertbe' ss--he would not say by a coup de mnain, but by acclamation, as if such a Proposition was ever likely to have a moral or a useful tendency. He hirauseif thought it was aureat blot on the Bill, and would be fraught with unmixt evil t intead of good, because he believed that, such an enactment would be the means of removing that which in every honourable mind must be the great check to theacommision of adultery. Suchaoclauseo headmittedwas alway introduced inito privat-e Billa for divorce in their lord 'ps' House, but he believed waR invariab,ly struck out in committeeu; at all events, it Was alWaYs expunged in the other House of Parliament. Therefore it was that he had not thought fit to reintroduce the clause into the present maeasure. One other matteranad hehad done. Inthecom. mifttee the question was agitated whether or not a clause should he ixntroduced into a Bill of this nature prohibiting the action for criminal converstion. The committee was very much divided on that subject ; eventually no such proposa was carried, and the BRil went down to the House of Commons without any such clause. Therehad, however, beenmuch discussion on the sabject ever since, and he had thought that this was probably the best course. The objection to, that action wa that it was generally a scandalous exhibition (hear, hear), andl that the feeling of mankind revolted at the notion of a husband making a sort of Profit from his wife's csaceand his own diahonour. (HIear, hear.) Why, then, vrere tese actons brought? Because itwas a dthandig order of their lordshipe' Houms that, unless a verdict had been obtained in such an action, no divorce should be granted. The question was whether, if the necessity for these actions was removed, it should be left optional with persons to have recourse to such proceedings if they thought fit; and he proposed that, whereas an action of crim. con. was now the necessary peli iny to a divorce, such action should in future only bebroht iuthe event cf a divorce having been obtained. He confessd he could not quite satisfy himself that it wans reasonable to say, after a diVOrce had been obtained by a husband on account of the adultery of a wife, that the usb should not be entitled to maintai an action for such grievous wrong, as he could do for avy other legal wrong. He believed that actions of this descrption would very rarely be brought when they ceased to be absolutely necessary, and he merely proposed to assimilate the law in this reect to that of Scotland, where, lthou3h sneh aimonswa maintainable they were very sedoma reforted to He thought, however that csses might arise in which gea;;t injustice would result from precluding husbands from proceeding by action for injurie of this nature, and ho did not believe that the orn tinuance of actions of crim. con, in the manner he propdsed would occasion any ndtl Besidesdealing with the quesn tion of divorce wa sincuo mati7fonid, the comlaissioners recommended that the divorce a m bse et thoro, now granted by the EccesiasticalCourts, which absolved the parties from the obligation of living together, should atilibe continued as heretofore. He proposed by this l that such urmisaiction should ho continue and should be exersed by thaejud,e of the Court of Probate. The miclesiastical Courts at present decreed separation a mThsd et afro, not only in case of adultery, but also in case of cruelty, and when stuch a decree was made the Court directed a payment unbder the name of alsony, regulated in amountaocording the husband`smeans, to be made to the wife. He propsedto continue the presenbt system,oproviding, however, that the alimony might be paid, if the Court thought fit, not to the wife herswlf baut to trustees for the wife. He proposed, also, to adld a new clause, justifying divorce a medod et thoro -namely, unjustifiable desertion. It had often been a subject of complaint that if -a husb-an deserted his wife for a great length of theu, and subsequently returned, he was entitled, if he found she had earned or succeeded to any prprty durin his absence to claim and appropriate it,pr He (thord 0ha=11ori proposed to remedy this evil by enacting e that after a husband had deaerted his wlfe without riasonable caueior a certain defined period a decree of separtion might be obtalin but that h patiers might astll cohabit againc if they thought propr t doso.This portion of the measurm ergre aso e mostssential iamportance, affeoting, as it did, the socialhsuttus of the husband and wife after a divorce haod tar place, not a t o inculo mat rimoni, but a beli et Mrou AlthOugh the Eccleiastical Courts bad now the power of decreeing divorce a menso et thhro, which precluded the Parties from the right of istiglupon cohabitation, and so far hsePated them, yet their si relations with the community were scarcely altered in any respect.

That provierion, he believed, would remedy many of those evils, desoribed, no .doubt, with truth, as the gievances of murmred women,aOf which he, in comron, probbly, with a gretnmany of their lorped hps had lately heard so much. f his proposition shoud be.adopted, whenever ahusband haddesertedbhiswife, and had so conductedrhimded that upon any groud aseparation might beobtained a mensd d thoro, the wifemightsafely trade or exercise a Profession and ancumulate money, and she would be protected in the enjoyment of the fruits of her industry just as if she had no husband. He was perfectly awae that this might by some persons be egarded asvei2. imperfect and meagre remnedy for a state of thing which ought to be dealt with On much broader grounds. There were some who in considering the subject of divorce would open the whole question of the relations of marrage; a uhis noble and leaned friend Lord Brougham, whom he hoped they would soon again mee in his Place, had during the lae. short sesson introduced a Bill which would entirly alter the social relations of husband and wife so far as poroprtyansa conoered, end which wouly d provide substau- tiay that there should be no community of goods what ever, but that the husbandrand wife shouldt be as much distinct persons as brother and sister. He (the Lord Chancellor) would not allow himself to be led into anY discussiou upon that sbethfor the question of divorce was one of so much difficulty and extent that it ought to be dealt with alone; and if he succeeded by the present measure in iraproving the iaw which should be enforced when, unhappily, cicnstanosearo which naturally nd justy led to a dissolution of the mnarriage tie, he should consider that he had accmplshe a eryimprtat ojec, eenalthough there migh ye reainto e cosidredon omeother occasion thequetio wethr te hol soia reatinsof married The Archbishop of CANTERBjy said the subject which had been brought before their lordships in the Bill which hisnoble and learned friend had so lucidly explained was justly introduced by him as a most nirportuat subject, for it affected the social life of the community. It was also a moat difficult subject, for it was impossible in cases of this kind to foreseethe consequences which might result from legislation, There was great danger, lest in endeavouring to apply a remedy to an existing and acknowledged evil they opened the way to greater evils than those which they deired to remove, The facilities of divorce, alluded to by the noble lord, which had been admitted in many of the Protestant States on the con tinent, were no doubt intended not to injure morality, but to obviate existing inconveniences. But those facilities had ended in so gross a laxity of morals that it was notorious that there was a strong desire in those countries to remove them, and to return to a state of things more in accordance with the system which happily in this country had never been set adde. On these grounds he had always felt it to be no slight comfort that in legisating concerning marriage they had authority to guide them which could not direct them wrong; that they could appeal to the Divine law, and proceed as far as that allows to proceed, and stop when it directs them to stop. This had always been his comfort In a distressing question on which their lordships had been often called to decide,-the marriage of a widower with his deceased wife's sister. Believing as he did that the Scriptures forbad that union, he hadnever thoughthimself at lberty to lBten to the plausible arguments from expediency which he had heard on the other side. He took the same ground respecting the measore now upon the table. He appealed to tne Divine law. No ene, he thought, could deny that, accord'nto the general tenour of that law, marriage, once contracted, was designed to be indissoluble-indissolublc, saving for one cause-a cause which destroyed the purpose and intent of marriagesaving for the cause of unfaithfulness. For that cause it was declared lawful for a man to put away his wife, and, by converse, for a womau to DUt away her husband. The Bil provided for this, un7der Uch precautions and safeguards as legal experience and a knowledge of human nature showed to benecessary. He did not see that they could refuse this liberty to a wife or husband; though he might regret that circumstances which they couad not alter rendered this relief less available to one class of the community than another. But here he stopped. He regretted that the BiUl did not stop here. One section permitted the parties whose guilt had occasioned thedissolutionof the first marriage toform afterwards a legal union; whereas the Divine law said, " Whosoever shall marry one that is put away committeth adultery." He could not venture to contravene the Divine law, evea if he could not perceive its reasonableness. Bt surely it did approve itself to their judgment. Their object was to prevent crime. But surely they offered temptation to crime if they permitted the commission of crime in the first instance to lead ultimately to that result which had unhappily become the desired result, and to end in even permanent legalized union. Surely the first spark of guilty passion ought rather to be extingishedbytheconvictionthat its indulgenceeouldonlyleadtoreproachanddegradahon. He believed that they would best consult the interests of morality and the comforts of social life if in legislating on this delicate subject they adhered closely to the prinniple which Scripture had laid down. On these grounds, while he voted for the aecond reading of the Bil he must oppose in committee the clause which permitted the guilty parties to be united in legal marriage. No Peer rising immediately to address the House after the most rev. prelate there were general cries for Lord Lyndhurat. Lord LYNDHURST then rose and said, he did not know what course precisely to pursue, as he had suffered under the misfortune of not having heard a word of what fell from the most rev. prel4te. He understood, however, that on the whole the most rev. prelate gupported the Bill; but whether it was on the ground of the tribunal which was to be established he did not know. A Bill of this nature had passed through the House on three different occasions. The subject was examined very attentively by a committee of that House, and when afterwards the Bill went down to the other House it went down sanctioned by a very considerable maority of their lordships' House. Heoould not, nevertheCeS,S disguise from himEelf that both in the House and out of doors there was very considerable opposition to the measure. It was opposed, as he understood, both on social and religious grounds. A noble andlearned friend of his, forwhose opinion he had great respect, only last night, in the neighbourhood of that House, said he was strongly opposed to the measure. Another noble friend of his, whom he might almost call a noble and learned friend, had circulated in print a very able article in opposition to the very principle of the Bill; and a right rev. prelate, whom he formerly hadhad the happiness to have as his diocesan, who ornamented every subject he touched and gave point and vigour to every argument ho used, was one of the most strenuous opponents of the present measure. It was impossible, therefore, for him nsot to feel very considerable anxiety with respect to the resjl' of this discussion. He flattered himself a short time ago that that right rev, prelate was not now present in the House, but the right rev. prelate had recently made his appearance, and his active change from one position to another was a proof that the right rev. prelte was preparing for a desperate conflict on this subject, (A. Iaugh.) [The Bishop of Oxford was understood to be the prelate alluded to.1 It would not become him (Lord Iyndhurst) to enter into any Scriptural argument in the presence of the ocdesiastcal ray he had now the happiness to see before him. [There was a considerable attendance of the members of the right rev. bench.] Ho said this because on a former occasion their lordships had not had tho Advantaie of the intelligence, in formation, learning, and knowledge of that right rev. bench. ("Hear," and a laugh.) Considering, however, the feeling wshich prevailed on this subject, he should take the liberty of referring to authorities which he considered conclsive, as to the Scriptural doctrine that marriage might be die. 5olved in case of adultery. He maintained that that was the principle of the whole Protestant Church over and over again declared tobe sanctioned by the express terms of the Scripture. It was supported by the concurrence of almost all authorities in the early period of the church, and was sanctioned by provincial and general councils This alone was sufficent authority to decide the question, and, withrespect to our own church, he would call their lordships' attention only to that document to wrhich his noble and learned friend had referred, the Refo-mtio Zegums, drawn up by men partly ecoleiastices and partly civilians, all men of great learning * nd intelligence, who, after considering the subject fullv and maturely, pronounced in favour of the dissolution ofmarrhsge in case of adultery. This was a body of authority which he for one felt, and all who had considered it mut feel, was not to be resisted. On the other hand, he admitted that, according to the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, marriage could not be dissolved, because there it was re garded as a sacrament; but he thorght he was authorized to say that the establishment of that principle must be traced to the Council of Trent,-a council which was anxious to extend the power of the Pope, and to enable the Emperor of Germany to crush the Protoenbts and destroy the Protestant religion. The authority of that council, conducted on such a prnciple, the Protestant divines refused to admit. His noble and learned friend had adverted to various modes by which the rigid tles lad down by the Catholio Church had been ran. dered, in mome degree, flexible, and by which itx pro. visions -bad been evaded. He would not eatter minutely into that subject, but would draw attention for a linute to the rule of the Protestant Church. Our law on this subject was derived from the time when England was under Roman Catholic rule% and with us, as with Roman Catholics, marriage was indisoluble even in case of adultery. Accidental circumstances had prevented the change of that law. The document to wvich his noble and learned friend had alluded, and in which a new system of laws was drawn up in the time of Edward VI., never, in fact, came into operation, and owing to aco. dental circumstances the law had continuod, from the time when the Roman Catholic religion predominated In this country do*n to the present time, on the same footing. He was bound, then, to admit that aocordiog to the law of the country, as it at present existed, marriage was indissoluble by any legal tribunal. That being so, as the Roman Catholic Church found itnecessarytoresorttorsomemesof evading the operation of the law, Bo we also on ourside had been obliged to have recourse to paLiatives, and during 160 years, as there was no regular tribunal by which marriage could be dissolved eves in the extreme case of adultery, applications had been made to Parliament tor private Bills to effect the same objece Well, this practioe had gone on so regularly and with such uniformity, that every person knew that if his character ws irreproachable and his conduct could not be found fault with he might have a Bill presented to that House for a divorce in consequence of the adultery of his wife, with a certainty of obtaining the desired result Laws, said the noble and learned lord, if they are incorporated in the people, ought to be precise, defined, exact, and xtended to all classes, embracing rich and poor alike-for all are equal in the eye of the law-vet every one knows that the present system is confined to the wealthy alone, that no 1erson with a moderate fortune can have any chance of suc- esn in resorting to it, and therefore that so far as the largest class of the community is concerned there is no law 'whatever on the subject. Upon these grounds I cannot see hat it is possible to make any objection to the principle of he alterations propoeed by my noble and learned friend. It t be right that marriage should be dissolved in the cae of adultery-and no one denies the right-surely such dissolution should not take place by occasional meaunres, but through the intervention of a public tribunal, open to all-to the poor as well as to the rich. But 1 remember that on a former occasion the right rev. prelate, supported by another right rev, prelate with eaqual ability, objected that the Bill did not answer the purpose for which it professed to be established; because, he said, the tribunal would be accessible only to the wealthy. He said that men of the highest rank and station in the profession of the law would alone be engaged in it, and he asked "Do you suppose that justice can be cheaply administered by such a tribunal?" The answer that Imake to that argument is short, plain, and simple. It is this:It'does not follow because a tribunal is composed of men in high station that tho expense shall therefore be increased; the proceedings will be of the most simple deScriDtion-a mere petition stating the complaint-there wilf be no pleadings, no rejoinders, no labyrinths of that description but the witnesses will be caDLed to the bar and they will establish ziv4 voce the complaint. It appears to me that it would be impossible to establish any tribunal In which the proceedings might be carried on in a simpler way or with less expense. In fact, I defy the "imagination of man" to conceive anything more simple. Airother obsdrvaVon mAib the'riglit rev. prelitf was to this effect --"What is to become of persona living at a distance? how are men in Northumberland or Carlisle to avail themselves of this new law? See how the expenses will increase if men from such a distance are to come to London to make their complaint" In answer to that ob. jection I observe that Her Maiesty has power to direct the tribunal to sit in any place that may be desired; but it is not necessary to recur to that power because a petition may be presented to the court from some person residing at a distance; the Court will consider what may be the most convenient spot for examination, and the examination will take place there; the judges wiUl hear the evidence taken on the spot, and the decision wiU be given in London. The opponents of the Bill said, " What difficulties and entangle. ments there are, and the more you examine the subject the greater the difficulties appear." Well, but when you mention difficulties, I ask, how is justice in this matter administered in other countries? in scotland a divorce a inscsdo is decided by the ordinary tribunals without any difficulty. In the United States also no difficulty is ex-, perienced in administering this branch of the law by the ordinary tribunals; and if this be so in other countries what difficulty there can be here I am at a loss to imagine. But then the same persons turn round, and theysay, with inconsistence as it appears to re, "This law is really only applicable to the rich," and then thev add, "but if you pass such a law for the poorer andhumblerclasses It will belproductive of the greatest mischief, of the greatest social evil, and it will demoralize the whole community." In answertothat I say that the present law is the greatest demoralizer. Aman finds hi wife committing adultery; he has no remedy; he cannot apply to a court of justice to dissolve his marriage; be says, "You shan't live with me ;" then she lives with her adulterer. What, I ask, is the effect of such a scene upon the lower orders of the people? Or, if he do not drive her forth, he acquiesces in her shame and guilt. The adulturer comes from time to time to his residence; he cohabits with his paramour; and what, I should like to know, can be more destructive of the morality of the lower orders ? Do you mean to say-can you say-that the interposition of a court of justice, dealing justice alike to all, and dividing persons of that description, wSi tend to demoralize the state of society more than such events as I have endeavoured to describe? Don't let us indulge in any theories, any abstract reasonings, or any visionary ideas on this subject. Whatis the case in Scotland ? The law there exists accessible equally to the poor and to the rich. Bas it produced any bad effects there? Directly the reverse; and happily the evidence in this respect is all on my side. My noble and learned friend has referred to the report of the commissioners, and I am happy to state that men from Scotland of the highest rank, of the best informed minds, and of the greatest opportunity of observation, all concur in saying that, so far from this extension of the law producing any bad result, it has a directly contrary effect; and I quote this in answer to all those theories aud all that eloquence which we have heard advanced on the other side. laving gone thus far, allow 3me to remind my noble and learned inend of some of my objections to his original measure, and to repeat, although this BiU is an improvement on the last, that it does not go far enough. The conmmittee which investigated this matter examined it with great attention, and I am happy to say that several of my suggestions were adopted and are now incorporated in the BilL I am sorry to add that it does not go to the fnU length that I ax pected, and I hope that you wil allow me to press some of my suggested amendments upon your lordships in the hoge that they may be added to the present measure. One oft he objections which I entertain to the principles of the BiUl as it stands is the great inequality which it recognizes between the sexes. The inequality is extreme. No extent of adultery on the p art of the husband can, according to this Bill, entitle the wife to a divorce, and nence toe trite but not altogether unjuat observatioi that men make the laws and women are the victims. The only argument of the slightest validity that I ever heard adduced against placing the sexes on the same footing is that the mischief resulting from the adultery of the woman-namely, the introduction of a spurious f-prIng into the house of the husband-does not result from the adultery of the man. But does it follow because there is this one point of difference that the rest of the case as regards the woman is not such as to require the interposition of the law? Is that the true and logical mode of argument, -to select one particular fact in a case, and to say that therefore the whole case differs from another to which, vith this exception, it is exactly similar? Suppose, as not tnfrequently happens, that a man lives in open, flagrant, notorious adultery, without disguise,-perhaps bringing his paramour home to his own'wife, insulting her in this way, and treating her with great harshness and even cruelty; am I to be told that in such a case the wife is to be left without a remedy ? Is that not such a state of things as to entitle the wife to a divorce? Does not justice imreratively cal for a remedy? The husband may indulgo in every species of infamy connected with adultery - and ought we not, then, to interfere for the protection of the women? Suppose the ciseof a double adultery-of a husband commnitting adultery with a married woman; in this case you have the spurious offspring introduced and the analogy between the case of the man and that o the woman is complete, Ought we not to interfere in such instances as these on *tk side of the woman ? My lords, let us do justice. Don't supposethat, if you alUowedawomanto separateforadultery,your courts would be filledwith such applications. Rememnberthat this proceeding could only be instituted by the Woman; and no one wbo knows anything of the female character an suppose that she would be easily prompted to inStitute a proceeding of this kind. I am satisied that every man who has studied the female character must know that nothing but a long, deliberate, hopeless case of adultery would lead her to corne before the court for a divorce. Everything which a woman holds dear is at stake in such a case. She loses her home, perhbas her position in society and in all probability the guarea.si.p and care of her children. All this she forfeit If she auccesfully pr tes an application of this sort; and I say, therefore, that the more you consider the more you w be stified that there is nothing to alarm you In the provison I am suggesting, aDd that such proceedings on the part of the 'women will be very fewi n number. As I have saidbefore, you ought not to legislate exceptionally, and I appeal agairn to the noble earl opposite (the Earl of Aberdeen) on this subject. He knows perfectly iell that in Scotland the law is equal both as regards the man and the woman, and that the woman is equally with the man entitled to prosecute for adultery. Does any inoonvenience arise from that state of the law? Has any evil resulting from it ever been pointed out? On the contrary, all the evidence we have is decisive on the subject I reer aain to the same document to which my noble aad learned friend has alltded. Here you have the evidence of most distinguished individual*, who, when asked if they would wish to see a change introduced into the existing Scotch law in consequence of any inoonvenmence resulting from it, give a positive answer in the negative, and say, " We adhere to the law because we approve of the law and find no inconvenience resulting from 2" But the case does not rest here, Irely upon the principle of your own ecclesiasticl law, which does not dissolve a marrige for adultery either in the cse of the man or of the woman, and punishes both equally. The case of the husband by our ecclesiaticallaw is put on the uame footing as that of the wife; that is the principle always acted upon. HoW can you say, then, that by extending relief in each instance you introduce , new principle? L the punishment at present inflicted is the same as regards both themamanc woman, how is it that by carrying this punishmaent still further you are departing from the principle of the law ? The right ev,. prelte referred me on a former occasion to St. Angustine callng my attention to the voluminous works of that very learned, diLtin15shod, and, I may say, curious individuaL (A Well, Ahgustine rests tho caes of the husband, uponu the authority of Scripture, upon the same footing as that of the wife. He draws no distinction between the two sexes, and, as I have said, en. forces his opinion by the authority of Scripture. But, again, my lords, there is another authority to which I beg to refer-an authority of our own church-I mean that great work to which I hay9 before alluded, the RefoMsajo LeZum Bcdesi caQrttm. The learned body concerned in, this workonstng of 16 divines of high rank, station, and learning, and an equal numuher of laymen ot the same charactercame to the conclusion that there was no distinction between the ras of the man and the woman, and th express a strong and decisive opinion on the subject. Wel we may go further. There can be no authority on the other side. Conjecture and -ingenious argument, entirely unsupported by any principle, may indeed be indulged in; but I think there is nothing like the shadow of authority in support of the contrary view. It is true that in old times this HOuse, composed of men only, not exactly administering justice, but legislating on this subjec legilated in favour of their own sex and against the woman. But there have been even in this HoUe authorties on the side of equality. Lord Eldon is one of those to whom I may refer. He at first seems to have been opposed to granting to the woman the same memaure of re lie astothe man; buta great change took place in his views. Towards the close of hlis caee, after long experience In connexion with this subect, Lord Eldon, upon Mrs. Mofatt's case, observed, in almost thevery words Iam about to use :-" I see no reason whatever why a woman shouldnot beentitled inacaeof thikndtothe smerelief as a man." Moreover, thiswas not mere assertion on the part of the noble earl - he acted uponx his belief, for he moved the second readinhg of the Bill. Lord Brougbalo, vhen first Lord Chancelor, o pposed this motion. I knoir, bowever, that the noble and learned lord-he is unfortunately absent from this discussion-feels strongly now thot what a man can do a woman should also have it in her power to do, and to this view he has given clear expression in writing. Lord Thurlow likewise expressed a strong opinion in the case I have mentioned, and lastly allow mn to refer to Dr. Lushington, that very learned judge of the Consistory Court, who has spent his whole life in inquiries of this kind, and has expressed a strong and decisive opinion on the subject. I may, perhaps, be thought to have overlaid this case with authonty. A strong feeling, however exists on the other side among certain persons. I have felt it my duty, therefore, to quote all the authorities I can, and it appears to me thatasfar as weight is concerned they are irresistible. I now leave this part of the case in your lordships' hands, but alow me as far as I am able to go a little further. What I beg and most earnestly entreat your lordships to consider is this :-When a man deserts his wife wilfully-in tbe bngue, of the la-, maslicdousy deserts and abandons her-the *"ould be asuffucentground for adivorcesavw7n slo md,-imonii Ittappe to me that the arguments in favour of that proposition are unanswerable. They arise out of the very nature of the contract of mariage, of the objects for whichmarrisge was instituted. Now what is the contract? The man promises during their joint lives to support, pro. tect, and cherish the woman, and that he will never forsake her for another. There can be no more sacred promise, no more forcible engagement, no contract more binding. But if he disregards that promise, and abandons bis wife, why is the contract still to be binding upon her? In commercial contracts if one party violates the agreement the other is released from it. Why should not the same principle be extended to cass such as I have mentioned? Then, what are the objects of the mage ceremony? They re three in nuLmber. The first is the procreation of children, and training them uin the love and fear of God. That object is directly defeas yactssuch aaIhavereferred to. The second obect is to guardagasnttsin; but that is not onlydefeated by the deserontaife, butit 5mUlj esde tohc 0ommison of sin. The third object of marriage is the comfort, society and mutnal protection of the husband and wife; but tbatis equally defeated by such acts as I have mentioned. Thus the whole objects of marriage are defeated by malicious, wilful abandonment of a wife, and under such eircumstances I would ask whether it is just that a woman should be bound by a contract the whole objoets of which have been defeated bythe act of her husband? But then some may doubt whether what I propose is within the SerVi tures, and Tveb3e rit has the sanction of any eeeleeiastiea uort.Ivl nyeyta the eubject was discussed overand over agS3n most carefnllyandmost solemnly upon the contnent at the period of the Reformation, and it was then decided that not only were such acts grounds for dissolving marriage, but that such doctrine ws sanctioned by Scripture. That was tbe result arrived at afterargument not only by ecciesistics of the reformed church, but also 0y learned, pious, and eminent laymen. I cannot do better than mention one, the- mos eminent jurist on the continent of Europe-Grotius I wil only add, that in Scotland this subject was argued by Lord Stair in a manner frieh cannot be surpassed. I hope my noble and learned friend wiU conslder this point before he dB in com- adop mny sfug. mittee with the Bill, and 1tr ist that he U adoptmy?g gestion. If he does not, I certainly shall feel it my duty to propose a clause, and to press it upon the HIouse. Cases of the ind I refer to have come under my notice times out of number. A man marries a woman witi' some small means. He remains with her ashort time, dissipates her money, and then abandons her. She struggles on by berelf, untl by some good fortune she receives a legacy, or by her industry accumulates a little money, when the man reappears, seizes the property, claims it as his own and then acts the old part over again, until, the money .being spent, he finallRy abandons her. This is not an isolated case I have seen two or three cases mentioned in the apndix to the eport 'which are given as examples, but ave heard and r"own of innumerable instances of this kind. There was a case once before your lordships which I will venture to recall to your recollection. A young girl of 15 years-partly by force, partly by fraud an contrivanor-was carried off by a man and married to him. Some months after sbe waa discovered, the man was indicted and sentenced to two yeare imprisonment, Mr. Earon Gurney, the learned judge, regretting that he was unable to add hard labour. The gir was made a ward in Chancery. Her property was secured ; but the man, after tho expiration of his imprisonment, was never heard of. That, however, is a case which stands by itself. I would wish once more to call your lordships' serions attention to the law of Scotland. WilEni desertion of a wife is by the law of Scotland a sndicient ground for the dissolation of the marriage, and the law is constantly acted upon without causLng any inconvenience. My noble and learned friend Paid something about Prussia and the laws of that country. The facilities for divorce there are extravagant beyond measure, ad the Legislature has had to reconsider them. Wbat ha been the result? They have decided by unanimous votethat adultery and wilful desertion are scriptural grounds of divorce, and have accordingly retained them as such. With regard to Scotland, my lords, I cannot avoid express ing the astonishment which all must feel at the difierent state of the law in that country and in this. We all live under the same Sovereign; the laws are made by the same legislature, but yet the laws of each country are directly contrary. Bills are occasionally brought into Parliament to assimilate the law relating to commerce or bills of exhange in :England and Scotland, but we have never attempted to assimilate those laws which relate to and affeot every family throughout the empire. It is truly singular neglect which permits so extraordinary a state of things. Ts ethe case of a man who marries in England, then pro. ceeds to Scotland, where he is divorced and reunarrie. EIe uen comes back to England with his Scotch wife, whither he is followed by his divorced wife, who appeals to the Ecclesiastioal Court for a restitution of conjugal rights. She succeeds, and restitution of conjugal rights is awarded to her, while the man has also his Scotch wedded wife. Anything more extraordinary, more anomalous, cannot be conceived. My strength, my lords, does not enable me (loud cheers) to follow the noble and learned lord into all the points upon which he touched. I had intended to have said something about criminal conversation, but must postpone that to a future occasion. I must remark, however, that my noble and learned friend has changed aides on this occasion. At present the law is that no divoree shall be granted until a verdict for damages for criminal conversation has been obtained. My noble and learned friend proposes to change that, and says you must have a divorce first and an action for criminal conversation afterwards, Novr, what is a Roman Catholic to do? He cannot obtain a divorce, and therefore, no matter how great his wrong, he is not to be allowed to bring an action against the seducer of his wife. (Hear, bear.) I do not know whether my noble and learned friend has considered that point. There are matters to which I need not now advert, ystate m reasons for troubling your iordships on this occasion. If I had postponed until the committee the suggestion of these amendments your lordships would have been called upon to decide at once, but I thought the subject of so much importance, of such deep terest, that I demed it wiser and more respectful to this ouse to binDg *rf maters under its notice at this early stage, in order -tiat your lordship. might have an oppor- tunity of fully copsidering them betore the committee upon tsB thes amendments inL the Commite,klesIhp orlraiswl dp,i not all, at Ie4~ ra xetm ves n ojsiet thalt prtioofsieywihasn advctsoi.ow which Is sbett asmd yu,adwihi oe times the VIctmo hs as iht ecete from that condition, and I appeal, not to your lordshipe candour, but to your jusioe, to afford me the mean of doing so. (Cheers.) Lord WENSLEYDALE addrewed some obsvtions to their lordshipe from the cross benche; but he spoke in so low A tone, with his ba,¢c to the gallery, that is was impossble to hear one tithe of what he maid.

One of his cbief objections to the Bill, therefore, was that it as likely to inresethe umbeo diores b tth,trenOduering them too eas the obiectons to the eccleiastical courts, nd might be grut lroved in committe, he wroud rot oppose the The Earl of MALIESBUy agred -with the noble and. learned lord who spoke laSt, that there was s o much good in the Billthat itwould be a pitY to oppose the second reading. Atthesameime it 'wlis intention tovote incomritteefor any proposition calulated to limit the extensive and almot unrestricted powers of mar ine again which the Bill conferred upon those who might obtain divorces under the ner system. The Bill proposed, in the ae of a divoroe by reason of adultery, to permit the puties to contract a second marriage under whatever eircumstans the offence miht have been commited. He thought the liberty of marrying again should be restricted, for nothing oould be more in jurious to the interests of morality, for example, than .to allow a mnl to mar after he had divorced his wife for adultery, if it could be shown that le had seduced his wife and lived with her in a state of coneubinage before marriage. It was to be hoped also thr.t some limit. would be pSt to the power of obtaining. ditorces, and that the sme parties 'would not be allowed to get a second or even a third divorce, as he had knowi to be thb cue in Saxony and other parts of Gersany.

Lord CAMPBELT aid their lordahipe would receiv with the sincerest repect what had fallen fromthenobl duke. The opposition of the noble duke'was consistet, becaue, according to bis faith and the faith of his ances tor, marriage was sacrament, and could not be disolved, But all Protetant churches held that, according to the prcepta of their Divine founder, for adultery marriage might be dissolved, ad it seemed to him to be straining and quibbling 'when any other interpretaion was attempted to be-put on the words of our Lord. (Hear.) As no attempt had been made to awer what heimst call theunanSwerable Speech of his noble and learned friend (Lord Lynd. hunt), it would be Absurd for him to go over the Same arguments. Atthe same time he thought he might attempt, perhaps not unsuccedully, to quiet the apprehensions of his noble and learned friend (Lord Wensleydale), who com plained that by this Bill they were altering the law, for by the law of England marriage was indissoluble. That was a mere legal subtlety, spoken by a laWyer, and contrary to fia and common eense. For 200 yea marriage by the law of England had been dissoluble for adultery. For 200 yearsithadbeenamatterof right that a husband whose 'wife bad been unfaithful, andwho.had beenakindand attentive husband, might apply for a divorce, and a divorce he was sure to obtain. In Bills of Diocrce their lordships had nominally acted legislatively, but had really acted judidally. They had seen that the- alegation of adultery 'was estblished and as I matter of course, they had granted the remedy praye by the inured party. Tbht had been the invariable ocourse, and by the practioe, therefore, of the law of England, any one proving adultey bd a riBht to a divorcoe and to ma3rr again. Be had the honour to at the head of the commissOn appointed in 1850, and the object of the Commis. sioners 'was not to alter the law, but the procedure by 'which the law was carried into effect They were shocked at the complexity of that procedure-first, that there should be an action for criun con.; second, a suit in the Ecclesiastical Court for a divorce a men,|et itao ; and then a petition for a Bill i their lordshipe House. The noble and learned lord on the woolsack had spoken of the three different pro. ceedingg, but he had really understated them. There was a fourth. The whole matter might be investigated over again at the bar of the House of Commons, and although of late years the House of Commons, out of decency, had accepted the evidence taken at their lordships' bar, he had himseaf exanlined witnesses at the bar of the other House to prove the adultery for the fourth time. lie thought these repeated exposures very much to the detriment of public morals. (sIear, hear.) The commioners proposed that divoroes should be obtined by a tribunal established to hear evidence and rnouue decees insbead of by sham legislation, aid thI91l*onId giv64ffeott their-& rec idimedtion. )Xarbyji persons 'were for putting the sexes on entire equality as to divbrces, and his noble and learned friend said there was no authonity for making any distinction. The wisest of all codes-the civil law-gy edivorce for adultery of the husband, 'when accompanied by aggravation, as bringing the concubine to the same house with her. T,ord LYNDHUESBT,-That was the law of the Napoleon Code. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ n Lord CAhIPBELL-Yes; taken from the civil law. He thought marriage should be dissolved where it was im. possible to b3 continued. Where the wife had been guilty of adultery, according to the general feelings of mankind, there could be no condonation, and divorce should be allowed. Where the husband committed incestuous adultery, or adultery with aggravation which prevented the wife condoning, divorce should also be permitted. If all the purposes for which the contract was entered into were, put ;n end to the contract should be dissolved. To that extent he would go viith his noble and learned friend, but no. further. There seemed to be a general understand., ing that the Bill should be read a second time without further discussion. (Expression of dissent by the Bishop of Oxford.) He drew that inference from the right rev. prelate's not accepting the challenge thrown down by his noble and learned friend. But, however that might be, he could not omit drawing the attention of the noble and learned lord on the woolsack to one or twopoints' He had heard no explanation of the manner in 'which the Bill would be appied to Ireland, and he regretted that it would not free ngland entirelyfrom the disgrace of the action for criminal conversation HIe had often been taunted with it, and he blushed 'when obliged to coniess that such was the law. Lord DUNGANNON said, he had to express his heartfelt regret that a measure of this description had been introduced ilto their lordsbips' House, for he looked upon it as striking at the very root of the best interests of societyCivil, moral, and religious. He admitted that it might well be observed that it was hard and unjust that relief in the matter of adultery should be open to those who were in a position in society and had the meansto obtain it, but-prac. ticaY denied to others moving in a different sphere. But the morment it was found that greater facilities existed for dissolviDg the marriage tie than had heretofore prevailed, he feared the result would be that no small encouragement would be given to the indulgence of illicit desires, aud that tlhe happiness which had up to this time generally charac. tenzed our social relations in this country would be materially impaired. Their lordships would be prepa to admit that the solemn tie of marriage was too often bastily entered into and with very little forethought, especially among the lower claes of society. In addition to that evil, he believed the greater facilities for the dissolution of marriage which were now proposed to be given by this Bill would prove a source of nmisery among that clas of the people which it would be featul to contemplate. He for one regretted that any attempt should have been made to legislate on this all-important question until the matter had been seriously discussed by the Established Church, and the opinions of the church had been made known to their lordFhi a by its legitimnate representatives in that House. He ha hoped thar such a matter would have been submitted to the right rev. prelates for their serious discussion. He repeated that he viewed this measure with feelints of the greatest misgiving and alarm and he apprehended there was very little chance of obtainBng any essential amendment of it in committee. He had hoped that the right rev, prelate (the Bisho of Oxford) would have moved an amendment that the Bill before the House be read ~~second time tbat day FiX months.le re- grqtte the righ rev. prelate ha notj tse'htcns,fo'r it would have come from him with a force which few mem- bers of their lordshipe House could have brought to bear upon it. So strongly did he (Lord Dfungaunon) eel on the, subject, and so much did he arehend that evil conie. quenoes would result fiom the Bril under consideration, that hefelt compelled to move that it be read asecond time that day sixt onths, (Hear, hear.) lordl RDESDALe said, he viewod this question fr, moral aswel asa religious pOint of view, but pattinig out of Eight the religious part ot t'he quest ion., which it was not convenient to discuss in their lrdahipe' House, he contended on moral grounds that the strongest possibo e arguments existed against the principle on 'which the Bil before the House was founded, he ased their lordahips to consider 'wha t had been the charter of the people in this country under the existing law. Hle believed there 'was no country in the world, lookig satall clasews of the population from the highest to the lowest, where married life had been held so isabjc or had produced so much happiness as in this, aaid he believed that had mainly arisen from the obstacles which 'were opposed to the obtaining a legal dissolution of the marriage tie. lWkat had been the result? ThQse who knew the great bedy of the lower class in this country knew that am ong them maarriage 'when once solemniized 'was regarded in a, manner of wvhich it was hardly possible to apeak too highly. In the rral- distr2cts case were very commoA wbere people, 'who before marriage had bead remarkable for te immorality of t-heir lives, bdafter marrimag become respectable members of society. The noble and learned lord (Lord Campbell) bad said he considered that the law of this country 'was A law Of div'orce -that divorce was. sanctoired by the law. That maode of putting the case appearedto0 hiM (LOrd Redeedale) rather ingenious than true, He thought the rea fact was, as the Lord Chancellor ha stated, that the law of this country did not sanction divorce, but that excePtional laws were adote' wthrefrece o artcuarcases.

On the motion of Mr. BAxrTn, a copy was ordered of the report on the pathology of the diseases of the army in the East, by Dr. Aitken and Dr. Lyons. ORDNANCE (IRELAND) SUPERANNUATIONS. Mr. GROGAN asked the Under-Secretary for War when the superannuation pensions would be granted to the surveyors and draughtsmenlately dismissed from the Ordnance Survey branch of the War Department, Dublin, to which they were entitled under the Treasury Minute of i855. Sir J. RA&MSDEN was sorry that he could not answer the question. The only duty which the War-office had to perform in regard to these supernnuastions was to receive applications, to examine them, to forward them to the Treasury, and after the Treasury had decided upon them, to intimate thedecision to the applicants. It rested with the Treasury alone to dede in what cases superanhud tions should be granted. o ajor SIBTr ORP asked the Under-Secretary for War whether it was the intention of Her Mlajesty's Government to call np any of the militia regiments for training this year; and if so, what regiments, and at what period. Sir J. RAM SDEN said that it was not possible at preent to giveN answer to the gallant member's question, in ssmnch as until Parliament had decided what sum should be granted for the ene of e militia for the year the Government could not say what regiments should be called ont for trsning. Wlth re rd to the latter a of the question, in the month of[a last the War-office had sent a circuavr to al the lord-lientenants intimating to them that no militia regimenb would be called out for trainin ntil September, after the harvestXhad been got in TH SAVI1NGl-BA~Nx BILL. M1r. COLLINS askemd the Chancellor of the Exchequer what tim e intended to fixofor the second reading of the Savings.Bank Bill issued on Saturday, and also whether he would incorporate in the Bill the rules which it was proposed to give the Government power to make for the future regulation of these banks. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCH1EQUER said that the Bill stood for a second reading to morrow, and as there a Teared to be littleorno objection to the principle of the Bill, he pwreposed to read it a second time on an early day say FRriday, or MWonday, without discussion, to commit it pro pornA, in order to introduce certain amendments wich he coniemplated in consequence of suggestions which h d been made to him, and then to fix a convenient day for its consideration in committee. The real discussion 'would turn on certain clauses of the Billwhich were objected to, and it could be carried on much more conveniently in committee. He would take the present opportunity of answerin a question put to him yesterday by the gallant member for Westminster, in reference to the report on military education. That report was ordered to be printed by the House in July, 1856. It was printed and circulated to every member, but there was a voluminous appendix, which it was not thought desirable to circulate on account of its bulk and of the expense, but copies of it were sent to the office for the sale of Parliamentarypapers, and any member who desired to have a copy could get one on application there. fr. HADRIELD asked whether the Savings-Bank Bill would be reprinted and time allowed beforeita re-committal for communication with the country. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said that the Bill would certaily be reprinted after its committal pro forswA, and sufficient time alowed before the next stage for the purpose referred to by the hon. member. uMr. BARROW asked if the regulations would be intro. duced into the BilL The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said he pro. poted to make some alterations in the clauses by which power of ma I regulations was conferred on the Governhmennst, buthe did not propose to set out in the Bill the regulations themselves. REGIMENTAL CAPTAINS AND ADJUTANTS OF MILITIA. Captain D. O'CONNELL asked the Under-Secretary for War whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Govern. ment to make any change in the relative rank of the regimental captama and of the adjutants of militia regiments, BO as to affctthe seniority of the former over the latter; and, if so, whether he would lay on the table any correspondenceormemorials, and answers thereto, which explain the reasons for such a change. Sir J. RAMSDEN said that the subject had been and was still under the consideration of the Government, but no determination had yet been come to in reference to it. THE CHELSEA BRIDGE.

On the mnotiOn Of Mir. BENrrNCK, leave was given to bring in a Bill to amend an Act passed in the session 1lth and 12th Victoria, chap. 107; also to amend an Act Passed in the session 16th and 17th ViQt'orla, cha. 62; alot amend an Act passedi in thesession 19t an 20h ic--a ciia. *}l, entitlled, "A Anet to continue- certainActs`to prevent the spreading of contagious or infectious disorders among sheep, cattle, and other animals." The Bill was subsequently brought in and read a first time. RATING OF MINES COMwITTEE. Mr. HADFIELD moved that Sir J. Paxton should be added to this committee, Sir G. GREY said that this motion w as an infringement of the standing orders, The number of members of which this committee was to consist had been fied at 16. There were already 16 members upon it, and therefore no other member could be added without a previous order for increas- ing the number of members. The SPEAER decided that, as it was necessary that tere should bo a preliminary motion toincrease the number of members on this committee, the motion of the hon. member for Sheffield was out of order, and could not be AGGRAVATED ASSAuLTS BILL On the question being put that this Bill should be read a second time, :Sir G. GREY objected to that clause of the Bill which gave to two magistrates or one stipendiary power to inflict upon an offender the punishment of wtipping. The only case in which corporal punishment could now be inflicted without the intervention of a jury was that of incorrigible vagrants who might, by an order of quarter sevions, be sentenced to be whipped, but in point of practice that punishment was never Infficted. Sufficient reason had not been shown for altering the existing law, which he believed acted beneficially in checkin g these offences; and ho there fore moved that the Bill should be read a second time that day six months. Mr. DILLWYN did not mean to My that the preeent lMw had done no good; his argument was that it had zot redued these offences to the minimum number. His reaso for proposing a diminution of thepez iodofind to two months was that generally Aix months' imolisoment of tha husband-meant six months' starvation ord.rs d on the parish for his wife and family. Hesioui,(j s that these cases should be submittd tn *uri ea that the adoption of such a course would give rise to munh delay and considerable expense, wkich would defeat the objects of his measure. He proposed to sabstgute the rn went of whipping for that or irprieonmen, so to who committed these offences were usuily such sva e brates that an appeal to their msense of feeling was the on ,one which waes likely to bo. attended with sucoess. Be did r ot deny that the present system had reduced these offences, but what he said was, that it had not reduced the to thb minimunz, which the country had a right to expect; atnd he trusted, therefore, that the House wrould consent to try the experimzentwhich he now proposed, and which, if it did not succeed, he himself wrould most wilinl Consent to discontinue. (Hear, hear.) The House then divided, and the numbers were- Ayes... ... ... ... ... ... 86 Noes... ... ... ... ... ... 221 Majority againt the acnd reading-135 GRAND JURIES (IRELAND) BILL. This Bill passed through conamittee. MINISTERS' MONEY (IRELAND) BILL. The order of the day for the second reading of this Bill having beea read, - Mr. FAGAN rose and said that, in consequence of what had taken place a few evenings before, when the Bill had been introduced, and because there were a great many members in the House who had not been present at the former discussiong upon its eubject, he felt bound to enter somewhat fully into the reasons why he claimed their votes in favour of the measure under their notice. He should first, however, ob"ere, that upon the first day Cof the [session the noble lord the member foe Tiverton had stated it to be the determination of the Government to take the Bill in its own hands, intimnating it at the samo tim4e, in the most courteous manuer, to bo ai6 opinion that he((Mr.Fagan) was entitled to be left the option of either intrustingthe measure to the cre of the Government or proceeding with it himself. His first im. pulse had been to aceede to the proposal of the noble hrd but upon consultation with those gentlemen who had been his supporters in advocating the Bill he found it to, be their unanimous desiro that he should proceed to movt th( second reading. The question had, he venturedto hope not suffered in his hands, and he could only say thatif aftei the favourable division which he anticipated would be arrived at that evening the Government were still disposed to take up the Bill he should be ready to resign it to theiu charge. He should now proceed to give the House a alorl history of the tax before he stated the reasons why he thought it should be abolished. It had been first imposed bj Act of Parliament inthe reign of Charles IL upon the c%t of Dublin and other corporate towns in Ireland having the cure of souls, but which did not at the time possess any provision for the maintenance of the ministers of the esta blished church. The Lord-Lieutenant and Privy CouncD had authority given them to name the towns upon which it should be levied, and had fixed for that purpose, besides Dublin, upon the towns of Cork, Waterford,. Limerick, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Drogheda, andKinsale. Now, it ap. peared somewhat remarkable that those eight towns should have been chosen for the payment of the tax, inasmuch as they were inhabited principally by Roman Catholics, -while Belfast, Enniskllen, and other flourishin towns in the north of Ireland, the greater proportion of whose inhabitants were members of the established church, were exempted from the operation of the tax altogether, It was said that the property that once belonged to the Protestants had been transferred to the Roman Catholics with this tax attached to it. He agreed with the hon. and learned member for Ennisklilen in his argument in the Court of Exchequer that this was originally a tax on the Protestant inhabitants for the mair tenanceof their ownreligion. How. ever, 28 years after the Act was passed by Charles ILnamely, in 1689, an Irish Parliament, assembled by James IL after his abdication, Passed an Act abolishing ministerse money. In the preamble to this Ate the tax was declared to be "a new inquisition, which had become very grievous." A. period. of 150 -years elapsed, and nothing was done to remove the tax until, in 1842, for the first time, a motion was made in the Hrouse of Commons for the repeaI of the tax by one of the representatives for Cork, MIr. Serjeant Murphy. It was objected that Mr. Serieant Murphy proposed to abolish the tax without providing a substitute for it. Se (Mr. Fagan)' had nob the honour of a seat in Parliament until 1847, but in 1848 he brought the question under the consideration of the House. He then proposed th%t a subBtitute should be found in the funds of the Ecclesiastical Commissionera. Those funds then amounted to about 70,000h. a-year, but he showed that year after year they would be in process of being increased until they amounted'to 1 D0,000Z a-year. A select committee was appointed to consider tke subject. He objected to that course, because he thought that a sufficient argutment in favour of the repeal of the tax was to be found iu the qunnually-increasing income of the Ecclesiastical CommisIsoners, and he regarded the select committee as another Imode of shelving the question. However, the selectoommittee went into the inquiry, and they reported that the augmentation of the funds of the Ecclesiastical Commsoners might be rendered available as a substitute for miniaEr money. They recommended an amendment- of the Church Temporalities Act, and they added that, although a new trust would be necessary, compensating advantages would be found in the social, moral, and religious considerations which demanded tho repeal of the tax. At the time of the appointment of the Ecclesiastical Commission church-rates existed in Ireland. The sum thus raised was only 70,0001. a-year, but it vas felt to be so great a grievance and insult to contribute to it that there was a general rising against church-rates in Ireland, and for two years the churches were left without repair. Now, who was the Individual who pror ed the abolition of church-rates in Ireland ? It was Lord Derby, the leader of the party from which the opposition to the repeal of ministers' money proceeded. The reasons that induced that noble lord to propose the repeal of church-ratea were 10 times more applicable to this tax. In the debate on the Church Temporalities Act Lord Derby, then Mr. Stanley, declared that it was the Reneral opinion that, for the sake of the tranquillity and good order of the country, a different distribution of church property ought to be made, the mode in wbich the money was colected being in many instances more annoying to the Roman Catholics than the mere amount collected. This remark exactly applied to the case of ministers' money. The sum of 12,OOC. was not in itself a very heavy tax; it was the religious feelings which its imposition excited that made it odious. Lord Derby further stated that the measure of the Government was one which the best friends of the church thought would be advantageous to that body, while it would afford relief to the people of Ireland, and also tend to promote union, not only between Catholic and -Protestant, but between Ireland and England. Such were the sentiments of Lord Derby, the leader of the great party opposition which now threatened a violent resistence to this BilL Was there any. thing in the present state of thingswhich should make them depart from the views thus expressed by Lord Derby? He (Mr. Fagan) ventured to say, if this Bill went up to the other House, that that noble lord would not recede from the opinions to which he had formerlygiven utterance. What, however, was the substitute of the Government of the day for the removai of church-rates ? Lord Derby propoed, in the first instance, that 10hbishopries should be destroyed, and that when each fell vacant by death the whole of the property and incomes attached to it should epass into the hands of the Ecclesiasticali Commissioners. He also proposed a tax on all benefices above 300C. a-year; that aU benefices where Divine service had not been performed for a certain period, should, wvith due regard to vested interests, go to swvell the funds of the commissionera; and that the tithes of all livings above 8001. a-year shouldontheir avoidance be appropriated to the purposes of the commission. Another arrangement whc enade was that bishop's leases might on certain terms be converted into perpetuities. Mr. Finlaison, one of the ablest actuaries of the day, comnputed the value of those leases when so converted at 1,500,0001., and on the plan being first adopted, an income of 40,00&. a-year wvas obtained by the commissioners from this source. This sum had, however, since then greatly fallen off; and he (hfr. Fagan) thouglht that these perpetuities ought to hi made more available to increase the funds of the commis sion. This might easily be accomplished if the etate of the law ware only improved and a larger bonus offered to purchasers and tenants. At present no person holding bishops' leases would come in and purchase. In 1848 the income of the E3cclesiastical Commissioners was 70.0900. Nowv it was over 100,0001., and there sras a yearly increase because the avoidances of benefices had not all yet occurred. Their expeacnir ro chrchurpses whch ndewen vey lttle Penaiture for church 3,urposes, 'which underwvent very little alteration, was 35,00 . Of this sum 22,0001. went to pay sextons and parish clerks. By consolidating the offices of these functionaries 8,0001. of this 22,0001. might be easily saved. He ventured to suggest, also, that the meins for providing the elements for the Communion should be collected at the offertory, and not taken from the funds of the commission. A large portion of these funds was appropriated to the defraying of the expenses of worlnng the ecclesiastical commisson. Ho had no desire to inflict an injury upon any private person for the sake of the public good, but the information which he had received justified his suggestion that if there were only one instead of two paid commissioners the work would be admirably done. The greatest item of expenditure was that relating to the repair and rebuilding of churches. It was a remarlablo fact that during the last year the commissioners paid away 12,5001. under that head, the average expenditure being several thousand pounds less. The sum expended last ear was only equalled in two previous years since the establishment of the coi- m3isnon-n-viz., the first year of the commission's existence, when several churches wero found to be in great need of repair, and the year of the great storm, when three-fourths of the churches were unroofed. Ho did not wish to impute bad motives without cause, but the extraordinary large expenditure of last year certainly gave rise to the suspicion that the commissioners were determined to reduce as much as possible the surplus which tho Chief Secretary for Ireland had said was in their hands. He (Mr. Fagan) had been told that the expenditure was wasteful, and that in some instances churches had been repaired in which no Divine service was performed. He was glad that after the many laborious efforts which be had made in Parliament to put an end to this tax. and the many batren promaises of support which he had received from Prime Ministers, the noble lord how a` the head of the Gorerninent was about to exerciso all his influence in favour of this Bill. He could assure the noble lord that his manly determination had anend for himself and his Cabinet more favour amnong the Roman Catholics of Ireland than any Government measure had gained for preceding Administrations since the paing of heAc o CahoicBianepaio. heGovernmnt of ;LOrd Aberdeen entered into! a co m :j .

(Hear, hew H4e spo advisedly when he said he was mised into that liceiton. by tho conduct of the Irish Government, and more. brticularly of the right hon. gentleman orpposte (MIr lioramuan). In treatina this question there should be no. controversy about the facts of the case, and he would therefore call th6 attention of the House to those facts. Thehon. member (Mr. Fagan) alluded to the earlv histry of this charge and bad adverted rather indistinctly to its conziexion -with the Act of Charles U., and the declaration of' that Monarch involved in the Act This charge Arosa after the Restoration, and it was here not an uNimportant parl of the question to consider that if the o wnero a pro having perfect and complete power over it, put a chr-e upon it forreligious parposes sanctioned by law, and if thatplropert shold afterwards come into the, hnds of peroma. who did not concar in the religious views of the owner who. imposed the charge, they would, according to the prundple of this Bill, be justified in refusing to pay thechazge so. imposed, though the property was acquired subject to it. That was exactly the state of things involved in this chrge., The declaration of Charles IL adverted to the importane of encouraging the plantation of Protestiat colonies in Irelend. The nbrth of Ireland had already been largely colonized by Presbyterians, but it was thought desirablleto plant otber parts of Ireland, and especaly the towns, with ;nglish Dissenters. The words of the declaratlon.regardiBg them was that "They should be reprised for losses they had sustained out of forfeited lands outside corporations," and reference was particarly made to three corporations-those of Cork, Youghil, and} Kinale, the very baronies being mentioned from which they were to be recouped for property which they had lost. Them let the House attend to the language of the Act wbich inmediately followed, and in which the charge was imposed. It distinctly gave to the Lord-Lieutenant a general power to. " lay a charge on houses in Dablin and other cities and populous towns, and to raise sums to be paid to the parochi incumbent having actual cure of souls therein." The sum was not to exQeod Is. in the poand, and no house was to be vAlued above 601. a-year, ana then, after some words more explcitly declring the charge to be good and [effectual in law, It gave as the only remedy for non-payment distraint upon the goods& found upon the premises. The haw officers of the Crown would admit that where no personalremedywasgiveninthe, case of a charge, and where the remedY was only by distress, it must be held to be strictly and peculiahly a charge onro nerty. The statute clearlv made it a charge on property. The t rown and Parliament having complete power over this property, and having recouped those who had suffered forfeiture out of it, then imposed on certain towns this charge for the support of a parochial minister, the persons thus charged being Protestants and Protestants only. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member opposite spoke of a precedent forthe proposal in his Bill, and what was that precedent! It; was the one set by James IL in 16S9, when he attemptea to repeal this Act of Charles IL (Hear, hear.) Tha' was. the precedent which was held forth to be followed by the Protestant Prime Minister of the present day, and on ther ground of that precedent he was asked to repeal a charge> which was originaUy imposed, not on Roman Catholics, but on Protestants, for no Roman Catholic could in those dayshold property at a11. (IHear.) He held that this was as mauch the property of the united church of England and Ireland, and was held by as good a title, as were the estates of the gentlemen he saw around him, and which t hey so. honourably enjojyed. (Hear.) He would now come tothw Church Temporalitie6 Act. T.he hon. gentleman opposite gave it as his opinion that Lord Derby meant to include ministers' money in thatAct, but the hon. gentleman would aind that in the verynextsessionafterthatAct pased there was an express reference made to ministers' money, and placing it on the ume footingwithrurlbenefices. (Hear.) Mr. O Connell and Mr. Sheil were then in the House, and, though they were not sparing of their demands, and went. as far as they could go with reference to church property, there could be no doubt that they considered this as a permanent property of the church. (Hear, hear.} The Parliament abolished church-rates, suppressed bishoprics, and taxed the clergy, but with this subject of miniss; money brought prominently before them, did not think that they were justified in touching it. It had never been. suggested to take away the incomes of these parochial clergy; on the contrary, it was acknowledged by the Roman Catholics themselves that they were hard-working, meritorious. men, and that it would be gross iniustice to deprive them of one farthing of their incomes. i'he question was, then, who was to pay theirincomes? (Hear,hear.) The proposition of the lion. uember wasto take away from thes menritorious men the income which they derived from a tax laid on pronerty originally Protestant, and which when it passed into the hands ofRoman Catholics wastakenwith this charge upon it, for the simple reasonthat a proportion of those whob werecalled ontopaythe taxwereRoman Catholics. Wasthis. a principle which the noble lord at the head of the Govern. ment would have his Parliament sanction ? (Hear, hear.) Was it a principle which any honourable man would Sauction, that in a case where no question could be raised between a debtor and his creaitor but that of religionsa. debtor should be allowed to repudiate a charge simply because he was of a different religion from his creditor? (Hear, hear.) If the Roman Catholic tenant complained of the tithe rent- charge the answer which he got was that it; was part of his rent, that it had entered into the contract made when he took his land, that it. was as much the property of the church as the rent. was his landlord's property, and that be had no more right. to refuse the payment of the one than of the other. Twrothirds of the charge were paid by the city of Dublin. Itwas a purely local charge, which people took into their oonsideration when they took a house, just as they did anyosherlccal charge; and was it reasonable that the whole shoulc. be swept away now, just because the noble lord at the head of the Government, on the eve of the elections, misled by the Irish Secretary, and pressed by the hon, member for Cork_a city which paid only one-sixth of the tax, and. wnere, by the way, a very smart contest was then antieipated-had allowed himself to give an imprudent promise of support to the Bill? The uoble lord had doubtless found out bis mistake by this time, and would be glad to get out of tho position to which he had committed himself if it were possible with honour; but it was to be hoped that some of his colleagues would come forward and extricate him. (Hear, hear.) The Church Temporalities Act vested the property of the church in the hands of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but entirely for church purposes. The various trusts were recited in the Act, and it was specially directed that any Ins revenues which 'should, remain after these trustsh been fulfiled should be applied to the augmentation of the incomes of the hard-working lergy whose benefies wrere 200L. a-year. The inoomes of nearly one-third of the beneficed lergy of Ireland were, under 1l0O/. and there were a very great many under 1007.a but the surplus applicable under thi3 provision had not yet. been sufficient to raise all the inomes to 1001, Parliament, was ask-ed, then, on the one hand, to apply this surplus to. relieve certain persons, many of them wealthy Protestants from the payment of a tax on theirproperty, which they had acquired with that charge upon it, and on the other to go. on using it to augment she incomes of hard-worliDg clergy whose incomes were under 1001- a-year-which would they chooee? There was not an honourable man it the House. who, independent of all political considerations, could hesitate for a moment as to fhe answer to be given to that uestion. (Hear, hear.) The trusts leted by the i Taporalities Acb bad not yet been -nearly dischargea. aud yqt Parliament was now called upon to broak them All down for the purpose of sweeping away this tax; in fact, to oonvert intoa surplus that which was at presznt adeficientft(L E(lIear.) Aftert atcamethetitherent-cha -cmlmetuder. which the church accepted 75 per cent. of t ithes ged on superior property, in lieu of collecting the whlole from a large number of occupiers That settlement Was, in his. oXnion, Beneficial to the church, but, a it a ruide by the church on the ground that wrhat it woud 'was better than what it had, at afforded no precedsnt for Y1~ m asure. When that was settled the only stbjeet upn.w the- landlord which can be- attended with any beneficial results; it wonld still remain a fretting sore, and the mote siringent its obligationwvasmade on the landlord, bymixing it up with the pavment of municipal taxes, the more inconvenient wouldit be felt. BeSideswereitthoughtcdesirable to make this transference of liability, I do not see how the matter could beworked. In the old towns, iHke St. Mary's and St. John's, tho derivative interests ae so many and complicated as to render, in my opinion, legislation impos3 sible. In truth, I knowt not where the burden can be placed, save and except where it ought to have been placed when the Church Temporality Act was pagaed,_z,~ onthe fundsof the Ecclesiasti Commissioners; aud on the same principle on, ,%hich they make payments to curates and have augmented small hiings ought they to provide for the clergy whose miEfortune it is to have their incomes, in whole or in part, dependent on ministers! money. But to this it may be replied that for many years tou would cut off all the means of building new churches. My answer is simply this,-that there is only a chice of evils, and thatof the two it is by far the most important to provide for the proper maintenance of the clergyinsuchplaca&Dubhn,Limerick,WAterford &c. The whole amount oftheaproprt iscoimTrativelc «mall, and were the clergy to have a fixdstipend-say the amount of ministers' money as it now is, reduced by taking off one-fourth, as in the case of the commutation of tithes into rent-charge-I carmot but think that with the proapect of the falling-sn of two bishoprics at no distant period, and the gradual augmentation taking place from sunpressed livings, combined with economical arrangement, the difficulty might be met and obviated for ever." (Bear, bear.) The funds now in the hands of the Ecclesisstical Commissioners are available for thispurpose, and the (nly question is whether the House will sanction such an appropriation of them, or refuse it by rejecting the Bill of the hon. member for Cork. The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Napier) alluded to the tithe rent-charge. It may be a plausible suggestion to make, tbat, as the tithe rent-charge has been relieved of all those difficultiea that existed in the exactions of tithe, a simila:r course might be taken here, but in the letter I have ust' read thera iS an unanswerable objection to any proceediog that inight be taken with the view of transferring theburden lrom one lass to another. It is there shown how impossible it would be in those towns to transfer the charge from the occupiers to the owners of property. That course would, no doubt, have been taken by previous Governments had it been practicable; hut I am bound to say that I know not any prachical suggestiou that has been made but that contained. in the Bill beforo the House that is likely ts meet the difficulties of the case. (Hear, hear.)'. Mr. WHITESIDE was somewhat surprised that tlhe reasons given by the right hon. baronet for supporting tho Bill did not lead him to take the same course on former occaSdoxs. The hon. member for Cork had made use of words which he would never forget, and the true meaning -of which was perfectly understood by those who were familiar with the designs of the party to which he belonged. He said that "though the sum was small, yet this question carried a large principle with it." (Hear.) And then the ri4hthon. baronet cameforwarrd and said there was no prin. eiple to sustain them in maintaining this taxi because they bad relieved poor corporators 'who inhabitd houses under 101. a-year.' Having conceded something, theMinister of the Crown argued, yoU must concede anything; because you have submitted to a loss of 25 per cent, for the sake of the poor you must give up all that remains. (Hear.) In deal, ing with this subject, from a knowledge of the core takeni by the noble lord at the head of the Government and the Secretary for Ireland, the hon. baronet felt himsef plaeed in a difficulty, glossed over the principal facts of the case and came to a conclusion which he said was satisfactory to his conscience, but which he (Mr. Whiteside) tbought could not be satisfactory to the conscience of any right-minded man. (" Oh, oh !") The lang e used by the right hon. the Secretary for Ireland was such as would raise the question of church-rates in England, the questioii of the annuity-tax in Scotland, and the whole questiort ot the appropriation of the church revenues. Anl -theso questions might be raised on. the ground of expediencyj which was a plausible mode of argument at the present lay, but he believed nothing to be expedient that was not just; (Hear, bear.) He opposed this Bill because it was not just, and if it was not just he defied ane man to prove that it was expedient. (Hear,hear.) The hon. gentleman (Mx. Pagan) told them that James IL, amid all his cares and troubles, found time enough to repeal this Act. When he heard him use these words he began to reflect on what were his cares and troubles. His cares were to confiscate and extirpate and subdue whatever there was of Protestantism in Ireland, and upon the ruins of civil. and religious liberty to build up such a system of tyranny as was suited to his implacable nature; and his troubles vere brought upon him by the opposition he received from those whom he endeavoured to coerce; by the struggles of the fathers of those he (Mr. Whiteside) now represented, and by their efforts to carry out tho very principles which he was maintaining in that House. No doubt, the tax was originally established, as recited in the various Acts, for the express purpose of establishing the Protestant interest in these towns. The hob. gentleman asked why the tax was not created in Enniskillen, for instance. For this simple reason, that the Protestant interest had been then estabhlshed there already, and well was it fot Ireland and England too that it was so. Charles IL was advised that it would be imposible to accomplish that object without imposing a tax on the pro. perty in those towns, in order that the settlers might have the word of God preached to them in their own ianguage. It was good advice, and he acted upon it, though he did not believe in it; not that that was at all an unusual thing in him, for he seldom believed in anything he said ot did. There was no injustice done to the B.oman Catholics in the corporate towns in imposing the tax. The historian Leland gave this account of the transaction - i " Innocent Papists, although they bad taken lands in Con. naught, were to be restored to their estates, and the persons thus removed to be reprised If they sold their Connaueht lands,tbey weretosatisfythepurchasers. Bntas themode_ng of corporations seemed eesential to the security of govern. ment, and, as it was a point determined that they should be formed entirely of English inhabitants, there was an exception inserted in this article. Those innocent Papists whose former estates lay within corporate towns, instead of being restored to their possession, were to bo reprised in the neighbourhood,sothat the corporations should be formed entirely of mcn friendly to the monarchy.," ! The property was essentially Protestant, and when Romsa Catholics settled there they hadto receive a license, and the English Parliament quarrelled withthe Irish Executive for gratinugthes elenses. Thehon.gentleman was right in saying that James IL reversed that hct. He did reverse itm just as he would have reversed any Act which gave an. right or permitted the free exercise of his religion to any Protestant. He was surprsed that the hen, gentleman shoud have referred the House to such a precedent as tetr tojustiny hispropo3aLh From that tear there was nothing in the Statute Book to interfere with this impost, It was laid on by lawful authority and for;a good purpose; the person3 for whose benefit it had been created had alwvays performed the duties which were imposed on them with it. (Hear, hear.) There was no breach of trust alleged, and the question now was why was the tax to be abolished? Was the abolition to be granted simply because it was asked for?t If that wrere the case, then he could promise the House a regular motion every year from the hon. gentleman, asking for what remained of the church property in Ireland. Be should not have made this observation had not the hon. gentleman voted last year for Mr. Mia's motion-which was a revolutionary motion-a motion which ought to have been made in theNational Assembly. (Ear, bear.) This motion was a mere trifle compared to that, but the hon. gentleman brought it forward as a small instalment, in order that he might afterwards work out that which might be colected to belnis ultimate object from the wordas which he had used, tbat "though the sum at issue was small the principle was a large one." Mr. FAGAN.-The hon. and learned gentleman is quite mistaken in thinkcing that I voted for MIr. 3iiall's motion, I purposely abstained from voting on that occasion. ([Rear, bear.) Mr. WHITESIDE was glad to be told that he had been misled on this point, and willingly withdrew aU hehad said upon iL Certainly some hon. gentlemen who acted with tue hon. member for Cork had voted for that motion; but the objects of the two motions were exactly the same. (Hear.) The hon. gentleman argued that there was no pdnciple involved in dealing with the charch property, and, hving stated with great minuteness all that had been taken already from the Church of Ireland, he asked wkat hAve you now to say wvhy this portion of the income of the clergy also should not be taken awnay? He did not remember whether the noble lord the Prime Minister was in Lord Grey's Government when the Temporalities A-twas introduced; but the language of Lord Grey andc of Lord Lansdowne (he took Lord Linsdowne, because he seemed to be the most Conservative of them all) was very different from that which was used now. Lord Grey declared that he brought forward the measure in suport of the working clergy, othehe laborious members of the church. Hle insisted that the measure would not trench on the real interests of the church - that there wonld be 20001. for the increase of small glebes, and 30,0001. for the increase of small livings, though neither of these objects had ever been fulfilled. Lord Lansdowne was more particular. He "He would beg of noble lords to consider what would have been the result if when the measure ot the union of tie two kingdoms was arranged some such provision as those of this Bill had been made? What would have beentSe situation of the clergy if the sumof 50,000. a-year hAd at the time of the union been set aside for the imprOvement of small livings; if 20,0001. a-year had been devobed to the building of churches, and 10,000& to the erection and im. provement of houses for the inferior clergy ? These woro advantages which could not, of course, be expected to flow all at once from the BiU before the Rouan, but they *night be expected to result from it in the course of some time, and when they did ocur would thoy nob be of the gratest advantage to Ireland ?' These were the feelings whtih raempted the Government in introducing that measure, and Parliament, while it consented to the proposals made Intlat Act refused to touch Ministers'Money. (Hear.) TherewasnotoneRoman Catholic gentleman in the Uouw, whe asked them for the abolition of the Ministers' Monr.y. Neither Mr. O'Connell nor Mr. Sheil did so, their po'cy 'being to take all that was offered and then grumble aT,d ask for what more they could get on the first opwrtuni.y. That ws celled a permanent settle. ment, anm one of nst effects was to make the fortunes of many Roman Catholic gentlemen. They hit upon the plan of te ing all the church lands they could gt in perpetuity, at a diocesan valuation, and in s)me cases they got lands at five or six years' purchase. If I e were not mistaken, the right hon pentlemian iathe chair drew tbe attention of the House to tbhi mode'of 4 spohiation, and afterwards the real -value of the lands was rquired to be taken; but as long as they could have t ,t Church lands for next to nothing they wrould have extended to Ministers Woney the courtsy ef Po?.yph9n and hlave devoured it last.

The moment a man was called on to put ig hand into his pocket and pay a tax of this sort, he discovred, to use Mr. Shei¢s language, that " his paramount objection to Ministersl Money is one of a religious character " DOne of the witnesses, a Mr. O'Blyin, being asked by the right hon. member for the University of Dablin whether it was against the conscience of a Romau Catholio to nay a charge created in favour of a Protestant clergyman, although the property might have been acquired with that chgse upon it. asuwered, "Yes, certainly ; underwhatsverformyotpupititI Bhould consider it objectionable." That was aboldandmanlI answer, and included all descriptions of pro rty which haPpened to be held by a Ronan Catholic. Hear.) He was next asked whether a Protestant oould create a charge upon property in favour of a Protestant clergyman which would be recognized by a Roman Catholio when that pro. perty camo into his hands? and his answer was "H He oDuld not-a Poman Catholio could not pay it." That might be very good theology, but it was contrAry to common honesty. (Hear, bear.) " Although he should have taken the property subject to This WAS laid before a Commnittee of rave men who were obliged to liaten to Mr. O'Flynn propounding the views of his friends on church property. (A lauih.) "And do you consider that a conscientious principle ?-Ido. (Renewed laughter.) "Suppose you were to take a house and thea to pay ministeu money, butthat you were entitled to deductit out of te rents ould yon stil object to pay it?-I "Although you were entitled to deduct it out of the rent? -I would. "Suppose you were Roman Catholic bauker, and got money from a Protestant, would you object to honour is check?1-No. " How do yoU draw a distinction ?-That is not my own money. "Supposing your landlord isaProtestant, and you take a house from him at so much rent, and afterwards pay m - nisterae money, andsave the property from distress thereby, being by law entitled to dedact the amount from the rent, you would still object to pay ?-I would not have the same objection if I could deduct the amount from the suax paid> to my landlord, supposing him to be a Protestant." - (Laughter.) This was a clear and scientific exposition of th nclplea of political economy. "w ould you have any objeotion ?-I would have a little objection. (Renewred laughter.) " Why 1-BecauseI conceive that there should be no oompuls,onat all on reLigious matters. " You would pay because it is a charge on property ?-It .-.ould not come out of my pocket. "If it be a charge against the rent there would be no reasonable objection toit ?-Yes; the landlord might be a Roman Catholic. "Suppose the landlord to be a Protestnt ?-I would par it, but still I would object. " Why ?-Because I think clorgYmen should not be sap. iotea by any compulsory tam."P {Cheers) Eleunderstoodthat cheer. Ho understood the argument of those who were in favour of the voluntasy Erincple, and he respected, while he differed from, them; ut those who supported that principle in this countr would, if they promised to pay aman a certin umof money, keep their engagement. "If it were a charge made by a Protesant on his ow property you wold have noobjection to pay itx-.No "Then, the conscientious obJection wonld he entireys re movd if the charge was put by Protestants upon Propestant proprietors ?-I would notconsder that to he objeotionL able." That was precisely the case withrespet tothis tx ItwaX imposed by a Protestant Parliament and a Protestad KRing upon Protestant owners and upon the property of cosporathons of whiebRoman Catholics could not at thattim* be members. The hon. gentleman prooeeded with his Bill and met with various fortunes. At last the noble lord at the head of the Government undertook the settlement of the quetion. Thispart of the subject concerned tho nobl~ lord. It conoerned his consistenCy and his conduct as a Minister of the Crown, and he should be glad to hear how the noble lord would justify himself. It could not be glomed over in the easy manner in which the right bon, baronet (Sir G. Grey) had settled the appropriation principle inL volved in this measure. It watrue an agitation was got uo sgainst ministera' money, but it was of a very modified lind, aud was confined to certain towns in the south of Ireland. 'Until Her Msjesty's Government encouraged tho agitation the tax was nearly aU paid in Dublin, and had been paid almost ap to the present time. But it became necessary to deal with the subject, and the noble lord (Lord Palmerston) thtn Secretary of State, Sir Johb Young, then Chief Secretary for Ireland, and the present Mr. Justice Keogh put their heads together and framed a Bill, which the same noble lord, now that he wa Prime Mlinister, called upon thO louse to assist himin destroyingi In introducing that measure, which was seoonded by the noble lord, Sir John Young said. that since the timo of James IL no Minister hadventured to propose the abolitiodi of this tax without providing a substitute for it; that the Minister he served (that was the noble lord) could not act upon such a principle; that it involved the safety of church property, and the settlement of the church temporalities; that the Ministry (that was the noble lord) felt all the considerationt 3most forcibly, and consequently, while they remoted every evil which had resulted from the practical operation of the Act, they were resolved to maintain its principle. Snbse4 quently the argunent took , religious turn. Tho hon. mom, her for Dungarvan (Mr. Maguire) argued that this tax was originally imposed not for the cure of the soul of a house, but for the cure of the soul of a man; and be, with great force and originality, insisted tbat it was a religious tax, and that the noble lord, as a populr Minister and one villing to remove a grievance, ought to listen to this argai iment. The noble lord (Lord Palmerston) then rose, and, although he said but a fewr words, it was impossible that the subject conld have been better argued than it was by him, He said:- "H He wonld beg the hon. gentleman and those who acted with him to consider what was involved in the princinle tbey advocated,-that no person of one religion should ever be called ontocontributetoanythingconnected with another, He would beg the hon. gentleman to recollet how his doci trine would apply to the allowances mado to Roman Catholic chaplains for attending uponthe soldiers of the army and the sailors of the navy, and also other matters in which Roman Catholic interests were concerned. This tax had nothing to do with any religious question, It was a tax upoh property, and it would be perfectly preposterous to make the rate upon a house dependent upon the religion of its owner. Was the imposition or nonzimpoiitien of the tax to be regns lated by the religion of the head or of the immediate land. lord, or was it to depend upon tnu relgion of the occupier? If they adopted any such principle as that of the proviso, they would be involved in endless absurdities. The tax was one upon property, to which every man knew he was lable when he purchased it, and had really nothing whatever to do with religions feeling." Thus, the objection taken by the hon. member for Cork (Mr. Fagan) was, to use the language of the noble lord, per. fectly preposterous. That was, it was absurd, foolish, and contrary to reason and justice. Yet, the same noble lord who made that speech would come to the present Parliament and, with the sarme equanimity of temper, with the same sincerity, with the same anxiety to convince, and with a majority at his back that made him more forcible than Demosthenes and more persuasive than TiUll would unsay every word of that speech. (A laugh.) Hfe wWould say that this w not a charge upon property, it was a charge upon persons, and it was preposterous to call it a charge on property. He would turn the phrase the other waxy, and would turn it against those who then voted with him. He ((Mr. Whiteside) on that occasion voted with the noble lord, who bad two or three times induced him to go into the same lobby with him ("Hear, hear," and a laugh), and he afterwards said to his friends that the noble lord had acted upon a Conservative principle, and was himself muchmoreConPervative tban they had thought him to be. He (Mr. Whiteside) believed the noble lord, because he knew that his argument was sound. He knew that this was a tax upon property. Now, however, that the nioble lord had by a turn of fortune's wheel been elevated to the high position of Prime Minister, he was, as soon as it suited his purpose, to carry an election, ready to sacrifice the property which, when 13ome Secretary, he pledged his reputation could not npon any principle of reason or justice be touched. {Hear, hear.) Let not the House suppose that the bulk of the Roman Catholics objected to this tax. It was only the town represented by the hon. member (Mr. Fagan) and one or two others which made any objection to it. Archdeacon Bell was for ten years in Waterford -during thattime he was onlythbree times involred in litigationupo1 this subject. His just rights were punotualy paid by the correct and honourable mon of that city, whom, had be (Mr. Whiteside) the power, he would frat relieve from tb payment, and not those of Cork. (Laughter.) He had bee astonished to hear the Home Secretary attawcing theBill framed by bis own Government, and stating that no onq could understand it, and it could not be carried into opera. tion. These were the men to conduet the afiain of the nation, and yet they could not drawupa simuple meare to remove a practical grievane and to secure a jt right. He thougbt that the principle involved in the Bill of Sir J. Young of exempting the 101 householders and reducing the amount by 25 per cent., was a just one, although perbaps it might be said that it was a reflection upon the class which in reality governed the country, and no doubtthe 10. house. holders did govern the country, to say that they could not pay this small impost. ("Hear. hear," and a laugh.) Was t wvonderful, he would ask the House. that those who, li-e himself, w,ere attached to the established churh in Ireland should stand up for her property, when they found that no soner wias the question setled than it ;was sought againL to unsettle it. (Hear, hear.) On a former occasion the bon, member for Cork had proposed that tho commissioners should publish an annual report, and that any surplus which might rem3in in their hands should be applied to the redemption of the lax. Now, 't such a proposal he would be ready to assant, as he would be to any measure to remedy a proved practical grievance; but when the hon. gentleman came forward, saying that he hbA a smal Bill to carry, but a large principle to assert, he foth, himsanf bound to stand up and endervonr to maintain that which had been guaranteed by the noble lord at the bead of the Government when he was Seretaty for the llome Department. For his own part, he believed that tl-,e SQere. tary for Ireland bad been the chief offender, andatlhod brought the Government into a difficultT which .,9 bad nob apprehendod,unless, indeed, the noble lord atth% bead of the Government was willing toadoptbiaviews. 4j%thllieof1 4tril, 1856, the right hon. gentleman made a 'psehupon $be su ject; and IettheHouseremember'nowMtktn rea6 stood If the principle had been cstablisb'ed tbat t)is charge should beabolihbed members from Scow'and would natnriy have said, "Aboih the annuity-tax also."

He then refers to the defeat of GoMernment through publi opssuonacting on its representations.on the church-rate que3 Lion. He then refers to riots in Rdinburgh, which he scribes to the attempt to masintain the aunuitytax, adding, "That Wa a queition precisely analogous to the pre. sent.", Again, as to the roiet3nce to church.rates aaa ministers' money, le says ." The principle of the two complaints was precisely the same; 4amely, that'theprofsasorsf onereligion were ctn- uelled to support the professors of another. But iu Edin' burgh the annuit.y-tax was not an old tar, and it applied exciusively to ministers of the estblished churcitn Sotland.

The right hbr, gentleman then proceeded to narrate the results of his experience in Ireland, and he sid,:- "With respect to every one of those municipal bowds, they had met to record their determination not oul to resist payment of the tax themselves, butnot to allowotLrs to pay it. When he was in Dublin a large deputation waited upon him, who statedinstrong and decided terMs, but in language respectful to the Government, that they would resist the paymnt of the tax to the ttermost, Tbat as the communication which hadbeenmadetohim,thouh at the same time itwasnotto besupposed that any Goveyn- lehttwould give up its duty. Although ie had felt it tto be his duty to make tbat tateaent, et he-mu add that it would be the duty of Governmenzt to see that the tax pas asit possible that a gentleman holding such a poeition ould listen complacentlyto a depuation which inforiued him that net only wrould they not obey th elaw themsdves;, but that they would also prevent other persons from dotog o-?

It was curious hew before an election the opinions of 'tlinistet umderwenf a ^fhange. (A lau;gh.) Then the right hon. gentleman hadn*- s nimously determined to support the aw. (Hear, hear.)s Reehad said:- I " If the stat of the lawr were not wrhat it was, he should bave xhrank from an annual contest of this kind, but noe ao alternative was left to the Governmnent-theywere boutd to proceed firmuly, manfully, and DOprnile. thev were ompelled to cary out the law. The qit"tiod lohg mogagdd the attention of Government, and he had earefy mdeavoured to ascertain by what means t£ ledgi~tivechange might be made which might do justice and be atisfactoy to ill parties." : tNowv, the conclusion which he had drawn. from that spee. h badbeen that the right hon. gentleman. intended to crry the law manfully and fairly into effect, or, if. not, that he intended to propose a settlement of the3attersatisfactoryto. lipaties, and he could assure the. right hon. gentleman thbt if ho' had done so he would have supported him. Thus had the right hon, gentleman expresed himself, bat then eame the general election. .Upon the ~eve of that event the hon. member for Cork and the hon. member for Waterford had arranged a speech to the folowing effect:" Webeg to inform the Minister that we represent towsn tbat return a certain number of members to Parliament. We influence the returns of 10 members for counties.

The right hon. gentleman the Secretary to the Lord-Lientenant had been found open to conviction. -Renewed Laughter.) In his case a. fair argument fairly put wMs always sure to tell. Re, at once adopted the linisterial argon and said the Government would take the subject under their consideration, So the right hon. gentlemanpsld taken it under his consideration, and he who had first get Dut with ssying that he would enforce the law, and if wto successful in that respect propose a fair and equitable adjustment of the tax, had at length begun. to see the eues Lion in a new light, and, persuaded by the convincing ogic such as that to which he (Mr. Wbiteside) had just adverted, bad come to the concluion that the tax was of such a natune tbat he felt coerced to provide for its abolititi6n. (Hear.) The right hon. gentleman had,, in fact, settlod hiself by his latest speech upon the ouestion. (" Hear," and a laugh.) Ee (Hr. Whiteside) could lnderstand the case of a Sate man talinga clear view of the matter, and arriving -at the conclusion that he would abolish ministexe, money, together with all the rest of the church property in Ireland-a couse. which, so far as the Protestants of that country were concerned, would do much to destroy their connexion with tWls country. (Hear, hear.) Yet, if the Govexnzment were to adopt that course, and to overturn those institutions which Mr.Pitt, speaking the language of a gentlimin and a, British statesman, as well as Lord Castlereagh, ha4d declared tobebased upon fundanmental principles, then would the Protestants of Ireland be at liberty as to the course which they should take, and tho House might rest assured that, although the Protestants of Ireland were ready to be tbe friends of this country, get they would never consent to be her slaves. (Hear, hear.) If they found that the olergy of their church were, without due reason, treated with disrespect, then would the adamantine chain which bound them to England be severed. Ee had, however, bein led away by these remarks from the speech of the right hon. gentleman the Secretary for Ireland. That right hoa. gentleman had made a speech, the language of which be (Mr Whiteside) aould prove did not demonstrate that to do' awVy with ministers' money was a proceedin either equitable or expedient. Tho right hoo. gentleman had asserted that as the objections to the tax were chiefly of a conscientious character lb would be justifiable to -collect it for the support of cerLain hospitals in Dublin, the more especially as the greater portion of the tax was levied uponthe inhiabita4ts of that city. It was not, however, quite clear upon what principle the funds of the established church could with' justice be applied to a totally dieerent purpose. (Hear, hear.) The right hon. gentleman, then, would propriate the tax to what he considered useful ends, but,if he could not appropriate it to such obiects he would abol;jh it altogether. That, in his (Mr. Whiteside's) opinion, waa, somewhat curious line of argument to adopt. HEar. ) e could not, howvever,understandhow therighthon. gentleman could justify the abolition of the tax, qnless, indeed, ho were prepared to sanction theprinciplethatwhena bRomanCatholo obtained possession of property under oertaii stipulations, he was at liberty to set up his conscientious scrujasiu dersgation of those obligations which he had legally contractedL (Hear, hear.) If the right hon. gentleman were not p6pard to sanction that proposition, then was there no foit in the argumentto which he had given expression. But to pass from the sDcech of the right hon. gentlemat, hemust beg to iemind the House That as igitation had foriterlyL-An very mnuch fostered by the Government in Ireland, so at the present day much was effected in the conduct sf her affairs by means of deputations. There was nothing like them for attaining a particnlarobject (A laugh,) One got on very well, but a series of theom was irresistiblb and, acting upon that principle, he supposed A deputatioin had waited upon Lord Carlisle on the 14th of April laSt. The House had seen that upon the eve of the general eecbtinn the Government had chauged- their intentions upon the subject of ministers' money, and had subsequently ah- ounuiced it to be their determinatlon. to support a Bill which proposed its abolition. The immediate result of thit deteriination had been that the corporation of Dublih, wbich had never previously resisted the payment wf the tax, had passed a resolution upon the subjet whih they had submitted to Lord 'Carlisle on the oocasion to which he hal just alluded. The resolution was a follows "That taldni into' consideration that Her Majesty's Governmebt have exprewed their determinatio4 to, intibduce a Bill early nex= session of Pariament. to abolisx ministers'money, and the Attorney-General has discohtinned legal proceedings against the corporations of COD.

At the sitting of the lIords, after a few remarkl by the Marquis of WzsTeCTnI, The Loan CnaAcExLon, on moving the sewond reading of the Divorce ana Matrimonial Catues Bil briefly explained the state of the law of 3nisrage in this country before and after the Reformation.

The debate on the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes BiU strikingly illustrates the vaiiety, the uncertainty, and the perplexity of feeling under! which the subject has been regarded in this country for more than three centuries. Till then we had held the doctrine of sacramental and inioluble marriage, only allowing it to be evaded by a multiplicity of disbo'a.ourable sihfts. Then, by a sudden revulsiou, one o thbe most eempetent ana authorit- -A - ri'oun&la ever created If this or any otb- - 'thver extreme, and, oi miagemight be utterlydissolvedfo1 all the reasons that actually defeat its purposes. cLncnmstances, I that have so often had an iperious iljluence on our laws, reduced the recommendations of this body to a purely historical value, and fol* three hundred years on this point, as on some others, the Befornatio Legum Anglicarumn has been entirmly abortive. For the. whole of that period we have been evading the question by maintaining the laW of indissolubility to the extent of not permitting persons divorced to marry again, yet solemnly embodying the contrary doctrine in some hundred Acts of Parliament to meet particular cases. This is only one aspect of the absurdity. Our House of Lords is a legal as well as a legislative body, and by its composition peculiarly qualified for a legal tribunal in ecclesiastical causes. Yet, while as a legal tribunal it has had no authority whatever on this point, as a legislative tribunal it yearly sanctions what in law it holds to be no better than sacrilege-that is, the violation of a sacramental ordinance. Further, as a legislative body it has most jealously preserved the monopoly of doing wrong, and refuged to allow that to be right which it was doing continually. Meanwhile, the law of one part of the realm has been utterly at variance with the law of another, and it has not only been possible, but has not unfrequently happened, that a man has had one wife and one only south of the Tweed, and other equally legal and equally unique on the other. Such results may be only the curiosities of law; there has been no curiosity, but a crying scandal to social morals and national character, in the fact of a law enjoined, of course not with uniform success, on the conscience of the many, and annually dispensed with for the convenience of a few. That such a state of things should have lasted for tbree centuries proves the great difficulty of the question, and that the difficulty is greater here than elsewhere. This aise from the tenacity with which certain portions of medim-val religion are retained among us, and their perpetual conflict with other principles that have also taken root in the national character. As these contrary elements are still at work among us, and it is vain to expect that a controversy of three centuries will be settled in a day, we anticipate little more from the LoD CaAcwm ons Bill than an adaptation of the law to the existing Parliamentary practice, and relief from some purely formal processes which Parliament itself has hitherto required. Parliament has dissolved marriages, and given power to marry again on the proof of certain circumstances, and on the proof of those same circumstances before a tribunal of the highest possible authority it is now proposed that this liberty shall be given by a judicial sanction, instead of a legislative Act. There never was a more reasonable demand, for, if the theory be wrong, theh it is high time that Parliament should follow the advice of the Bishop of SAnsBUnY, and come to a solemra resolution not to do over and over again, with a sort of malignant obstinacy and irreligious bravado, what it knows to be wrong, and Will not even justify by pretending that it is right. If, however, Parliament is of opinion that it has not been committing sacrilege four times a-year all through this century then it can have no reason agairat leaving to the courts of law the adjudication on particular cases, on principles nowv established by some hundreds of precedents. This probably is nearly all that can now be done; and, in the present state of feeling on this subject, it may not be prudent or possible to see our way much further. The objection made on Scriptural grounds by the PnIiATE, and on patriotic authority by the Bishop of OXFORD, scarcely requires an answer, for the simple reason that it has been answered at least two hundred times in the negative by Parliament itself. GUY FAwxns has not been oftener paraded to be cast into the flames than ST. AUGUSTINE quoted in Parliament to be summarily, if not ignominiously, disposed of. The Scriptural text is an affair of interpretation, and at least nine scholars out of ten understand the single passage to mean that a woman dismissed in the manner and under the circumstances mentioned-that is, lightly, capriciously, and for no criminal cause, is not properly divorced and may not be married again. If this is to be a matter of biblical criticism-that is, if the question is to be decided on the usual principles of the Church of England, then we have no doubt the decision will be, so far, in favour of Lord CRANwoRET's Bill. The other point most mooted in this debate Is equally destitute of Scriptural foundation or a Parliamentary prescription in its favour. The Bible is very clear as to the heinous guilt of the adulterer and the adultress, but the New Testament, as interpreted by nine scholars out of ten, contains no doctrine that, the offence once committed, and the divorce having taken place, the guilty parties may not take some security against a greater license and a larger range, by marrying one another. The Lords, however, under the instigation of the Bishops, have always in the first instance refused this liberty, and always on second thoughts granted it. This solemn formality of episcopal protest, Scriptural zeal, and patristic ardour, speedily followed by a certain retractation and humble submission to the wish of the Commons, has now been repeated, as we have said, several hundred times, and it is high time that it ahould cease. At least, the Law Peers and Lay Peers may well be excused the unneceasary repetition of a farce the humour of which is so entirely at the expense of their own body. The Loam CrOEmcLo, is not an ambitious legislator, and we are rather desirous to assist him as far as he goes than quarrel with his shortcomings. He may very fairly propose to himself the limits already observed and sanctioned by the practice of Parliament 'without precluding ftuture extensions of his measure. Only in two cases has Parliament hitherto dissolved a marriage at the prayer of the wife, and Lord CRArwonTn is afraid to go further. Undoubtedly the position of the wife is very different from that of the husband, and it cannot be alleged that there is a similarity either of natural feeling or of public opinion in the two cases. A woman may marry a man known to have been licentious, and to be still licentious, without forfeiting her place in society. She may continue to live with him, knowing his infidelity, and even tolerating it. This makes a great difference in her favour, for a man can do no such thing. The difference is founded in nature, and society cannot de. otherwise than recognize it. Parliament, too, must do the same, though it need not be thereby debarred from giving the wife a remedy in casea where her wrong is really intolerable, where nature revolts, and society itslf requires her to lease her, husband. There are, in fact, many cases in which it is morally impoasible and disgramdl for a wife to go on living with her husbands, and for those cases there ought to be due provion in the law. Of course, the law now gives, o remedy. Parliament practically allows none. The present Bil deals cautiously with the case. of the injured wife. More must not be expected froL lord! CRANwORTH, but the omission leaves the measure incomplete.
In a certain tale of med:ceyal life an ingenyv'* varlet is made to ob.erve Akat if people went on improving armour at sne a rate it would end in. there being no arTnour it aH-a speculation which the event did woma*ely' -vewify. Nowi ir any -rson were to, pr lik. of ship Qu war, wq think he might be able to make out a very plaus60a case. For a great number of years, under the auspices of all kinds of Admiralties and at an enormous expense, Britain has been " improvinge' her national marine ; and here follow some of the results, as enounced and illustrated upon undoubted authority in the Estimates Debate :-Onr ships are now far more costly to build than before; in fact, even the statistics which Lord P.AxRslow suggested in a former debate were below the mark. A new steamship, instead of costing one-third more than, an oldsailing ship, costs nearly twice as much, in some instances nore till. For instance, the Queen cost 100,0001., the Duke of Wellington 170,0001., the Albion 95,000l., the Agamemnon ]44,0001., the Verne 63,0001., the Liffey 129,0001. This is the first " improvement." Next come the repairs, the expense of which is increased in every partienlar, in the worknen employed, in the work performed, and, above all, in the yards required for performing it. A ship of unexampled length requires a dock of unparalleled dimensions. Keybam used tobe thought a perfectly extravagant specimen, but Keyham is now a mere nothing. Sir C. WooD's predeCeSSor had actually to enlarge it, and when Sir C. WOOD succeeded he had to enlarge it over again. To all this add the coal consumed in steaming, and vve shall get a pretty good idea of the result of " improvements" on one side of the account. Let us now turn to the other. Naturally it will be supposed that we get work in proportion out of all this array ? Quite the contrary. " Since the introduction of machinery," said Sir C. WOOD, "into the equipment of a man " of raS'. e., since the very latest and most redoubtable improvements in the construction of a ship-"the chanres of her breaking down and "being unfit for service have very mruch increased, "and I doubt whether, if you put a less number "of steamers on a station than you formerly had 4" of sailing vessels, you would have, as a rule, as " great a number of vessels out of them ready for " service." From Lord CRENCE PAGLET We further learn that in other important respects our new vessels are by no means so available as the old ones. " They had not)" said his Lordship, " in " the present day that amount of stowage which " they possessed in the time of NELaSON, when a " blockade might be made an almost interminable " proceeding." They can now only carry some four months' provisions, and the circumstance, of course, " operates against our line-of-battle ships "affording accommodation for a large number of "troops." In a former debate, moreover, we were assured that the increased outlay incurred upon steam power had the objectionable effect of impairing the seamanship of our officers, and as a final result we discover that we have got far fewer ships of the line than formerly, and that we don't exactly know to what extent, or on wbat scale, we ought to build any more-conclusions of a highly satisfactory and encouraging complexion it must needs be owned. Now, if the end of the account is still to be more pay and less profit, shall we not finish with nothing at all ? Where are we to look for returns or for reassurance ? One thing is certainly consoling. If we are to assume that in naval matters the largest scale of operations affords the greatest room for loss our neighbours must go to wrack and ruin long before we do. All our mishaps are got out of 34 acres of " basins," whereas France has got 180 to work upon. Imagine what may be spent and sunk upon a yard " as big as Portsmouth, Devon" port, and Keyham put together," such as Sir a. WOOD assumes is the yard at Cherbourg. "I can assure the Committee," said he, " that the works which the French Committee "are carrying on there beat everything which we "are doing." The Americans, too, are building ships and frigates larger than any that we have, and must provide docks and machinery in proportion. There is this, however, to be said,-that we have got the Great Eastern-a vessel which can only go into the Thames itself sideways, and which will be to the Duke of Wellington as the Duke of Wellington is to a gunboat. That our rivals may immediately lay down 20 new ships of 30,000 tons each is, upon the principles referred to, a thing devoutly to be wished by aU who are terrified at their power. Seriously, however, there is enough in the statements now offered and the prospects exhibited to make a plain man ask what is to come of it all, but we think, nevertheless, that we can find something in the way of reply. True it is that our ships cost a great deal more than formerly-- there is no escape from this fact,-but they also perform some service of a kind which could never have been performed in days past. Perhaps, owing to the complexity of their machinery, they are more frequently disabled, but their power and certainty of passage makes them almost ubiquitous. To China and back is nolonger a year's voyage, and a steam sloop, even if she does cost more money, wil make three trips where a sailing ship would have made only one. In fact, it is simply the question of steam power, which in these days is no question at all. A locomotive engine costs about as much as a hundred stout carthorses, but in the end it is a cheaper instrument. What makes the use of steam appear more than usually expensive in the case of the Navy is that the advantages gained are not so immediately conspicuous. The Himalaya is no doubt very costly, compared with the oldfashioned East Indianman, but she can make so many voyages and carry so many passengers that the balance of profit is apparent at the end of a very short period. In the Navy, however, excepting in times of active service, it is otherwise. The Liffey could get out to the Pacific in a far shorter time than the Vernon, and with infinitely more certainty. If she encountered an enemy she, could manceuvre with so much 3more effect that; the old sailing frigate would be abaolutely at hermercy, and, under such circumxtances, the return, obtained for her double cost would at Gnce beappreciated. But when it is of no great consequence whether a squadron upon a foreign station is relieved or strengthened a few weeks sooner or a few weeks later , when no occasion for firing a broadside is anticipated, and whan, in fact, the instructions given to the commander recommend him to employ kis steam as little as possible; or, in other word2, to treat his new ship as if she were simply ona of the old ones, of course the difference between 129,600l. and 63,O00l. in original outlay does not semm-Lo visibly accouted for. What we really gaiaL is an enormous aceession of power against emergencies, andl if the emergencies do not occur we sre apt to overlook the advantage which was in reserve al the while. It is something like a man insuring himself against accidents, and fancyag he has wasd a good deal of money because ha has mever broken his leg. We must have s neamahip, and we must pay for them, not necessarily as guaranteeing ourselves a positive supericay, but as protecting ourselves against an inferiawity otherwise both certain and ruinous. The pi~se may not Es quite so clear about the seat6i which ships at war ought to be built, and zperhapp the debate 1roved rather that small ships were wanted tha, that large ones were not. Certainly a screw rAf 130 guns impounds a vast number of sailors, ccJrumea an immense quantity of coal, akd is selem -very active, after all. Even naval officers tQesmselves, we see, doubt whetlw the da, for hJ%vy line-of-battle ships may v hAve goni 'by i bUt on the. other hand, it wgowly credible that ia this instance alone the ideas of magnitude and power should be disociated from e,%ch other. Nobody complains about sloops, cor,;ettes, or frigates being twice as large and twice as heavy as formerly; in fact, the latest developruent of marine architecture has been the constructi,kn of a frigate exceeding in dimensions any,bing previously known. Bat if the broadside of a frigate is to be thus aug3mented, is the broadside of a line-of-battle ship to remain stationary, or is it assumed that there will be no lines of battle in future ? We cannot Iretend to conjectnre what character naval campaigns may hereafter asume, and the last war was so exceptional as not to afford much instruction; but we fear there is nothing in the prospects at present before us which can releaw us from the necessity of building ships as large and as powerful as any to be found afloat oil the seas.
Various &rochtures that we have received upon the subject of female training ii the poorer clases of this country show that in a recent article on this subject we touched a sore point, and hit upon a real defect in our system. It seems to be generally admitted that girls of the poorer dans in this country are brought up without a-proper,taste for household work. They are taught to read and write and to sew in our parih schools, but neither at school nor at home are their minds at all directed to this sort of work. One consequence of this mistake is the very grave one which we have already noticed; another-not quite so serious a one, but- still a serious one-is, that English poor women make very bad wives, in the sense of domestic economists and managers. " I was making some in<' quiries," says Ms. AusT, the writer of a very valuable brochure on this subject, " concern"ing wages, and, hearing how large these were, I "expressed the hope, or rather the expectation3 "that these men laid by money and were well. off. "Shocked at hearing that hardly one of themn was "worth a shilling, I inquired the reason. 'Was it "'vice-drunkennessB' 'No; those are rare ex"c' ceptions. We could not employ drunkards in "C'ourbusiness. It isthe badmanagement of the "'wives. The mouey is muddled away. To say " ' the truth,' he added, ' there is no s7ch thin9 now "'as a poor ma7's teife."' We know perfectly well what it is in the middle and upper ranks to spend a great deal of money without anything to show for it. It is the characteristic of a certain class of spenders. Nobody knows what they do -with their money, or where it goes to, and gossip, ever wide awake and curious on the question, gives it up in despair. It is known that the lady's fortune was so much, and that the father of the gentleman left him so many thousands il the Three per Cents.-a sum which the death of one or two maiden aunts is moreover supposed to have made considerably more. There are one or two snug little farms, and the professional income is not less than 1,0001. a-year. Well, all this amounts to something worth having, and yet the JOzmSE ae always poor. -Why ? They do. not keep carrages or horses, they live in no particular style, and they give no large parties. It is a mystery which is generally solved in this way,that the JONESEs "fritter away their money." Now, this habit can often be indulged by wealthy people without any very serious consequences-any worse effect than this, that the JoismEs make a very poor show and do things shabbily, whereas they might shine in the world. But it must be seen that the poor cannot fritter away their money without disastrous and ruinous results. Such a habit will simply make all the difference between scarcity and plenty-comfort and rags. The wife, then, who is by position the principal spender, has to a great extent the prosperity of these clases in her keeping. If she is a skilful spender she produces abundance; if she, is an unskilf#l one% she spreads penury around her. What a number of items does the food and clothing and lodging of even the poorest family run into! What a field, then, does even the poorest cottage present for good or bad management I And, short of these overwhelming results, there are others connected with the wife's management which are not unimportant in their way. The husband may have enough to eat, but it makes a decided difference to him whether this is cooked well or 111,-whether he sits down to a good dinner or an indifferent one. F'rench women have the happy art of maldng the most of their materials. An English poor woman fails here. She has not that command of- the cheap world of savours which the French housewife has. There, is a dullness in ber conceptions, a want of fertility and! imagination. She doee not throw her mitd enough into her work. And this general defect in the English poor man's wife has other bad effects besides. materia and economical ones. "It is clear," says Mrs. A-uswn, "' from the domestic discords, of which. "we only see the extreme cases and the fiercest "results, that the women of the working classes "have to an afflicting extent losb the respect and "affection of their husbands. And what. lating "hold has a woman of that class on the respect"and affection of her husbanc, save through her "qualities as a useful helpmate ?" The great philosopher of antiquity showed his knowledge of human nature oa no subject more than that of friendship, and no one part of that subject more than when. he descrbed what he. calls " the friendship on account of utility." Life, is not a romance, and the use that people- are of to one another is, as a matter of fact, the basis of a very large part of the cordiality that exists between one person and another. It is, a dreadful confession to make, but so it is, and the-motive, on the whole, does not. work ilL. There is a positively genial feeling between man and man which arinses simply oa the ground of uility, and because they matually serve each other' purposes It is no pretence:;, they really do like each other, because the3 find each ether usefuL What a large bodly of good and l idly feelingr among men. of business rises up upon this bais I Coevenience, produces a sort of affection. We like our very tools when they cut wel, habamer wells dig well, and pick well for us.. A good instrumant is made afriend of; nor, mnixed beingp as we are, can ve wholly afford to D,yerlook this source of cordiality even in sacred and affectionata.relationzipa. Huband andawife shsuld be uwful to ows anothr, and the wifh fulfils her poper shaws of utility when zlsi mnages the house with came and skill.

FOREIGN INTBLLIGENCE. FRANCE. mo followig appeaed in our second edition of yes. Ue:aav --I (rROI OUR OWN COORESPONDEI-T.) rffNIZ5, MIONDAY, MAY 18, 6 P.M. The King of Bavaria arrived at Fontainebleau last evening, at 6 o'clock. Hle wias received at the railread by Marshal Magnan and General Fleury, the E2:mperor's Aide-dc-Camp. The Prefect of the Seine-et-Ylarne and the General commanding the distrct were also in attendance, and the Emperor's carriges were at hand to convey His Bavarian Majeaty and suite to the Palace. A squadron of ahasseurs of the Guard formed the escort. A double line of the 3d Regiment of Grenadiers of the Guard was drawn up in the courtyard of the Palace, and a detachment of the Cent (Gardes stood en echdon on the steps of the grand staircase known as the Fer 4 Cheval. As woon as the party appeared in sight the Emperor, followed by the officers on duty, advanced to the foot of the staircase to meet the King and conduct him to the Empress, who was waiting for him at the top of the stairs. The Emperor and King entered the Gallery of Francis L, where the persons belonging to the household were presented. He then, accompanied by his host, retired to the apartments prepared for him. The King is accompanied in his journey to Paris by Generals Delpy de la Roche, Baron du Thana; M. Phelersteniche, Secretary; M. Grill, Physician; and M. Cetto, Orderly Officer. He will spend five days at Fontamebleau, and enter Paris on the 22d, where he intends remaining till the beginning of June. The fine weather which we have enjoyed for the last week or two has produced a very favourable effect on oommercial affairs in Paris during the last week. Families whom the premature heat is driving from town are hastening to complete their purchases for the season. The retail houses have consequently effected very good sales, and the provincialmanufacturers will no doubt soon feel the benefit, as stocks in Paris are running low. The latest accounts from Alace and the northern departments announce a brisk demand for articles of clothing, particularly for light summer wear. Business, however, is still uncertain at Lyons. The apprehension of a failure in the silk crop, occasioned by the severe cold towards the end of April, produced a remarkable rise in the price of the raw material, and all that was disposable was eagerly bought up. It being now ascertained that the injury done to the x7orm is by no means so great as was feared operations are suspended, and both buyers and sellers keep back. Moreover, the demand for silk has relaxed in consequence of the absence of the Americau purchasers from the market. The accounts from eow York to the 16th of April were not favourable. The silk goods imported for the preceding four weeks amounted in 1856 to 13,146,510f., and for the corresponding period of the present year they reach only 7,313,305f., and, notwithstanding such a difference, it is found difficult to dispose of silk goods in that market. It is not surprising, therefore, that so few orders are received from the 'United States, those yet received being chiefly, if not exclusively, for black silks. The sales of the raw article at Marseilles during last week amounted to only 100 bales of various qualities, at from 36f. to 98f. the kilogramme. There are 100,000 kilogrammes of cocoons in store there, while the owners refuse to seU until the result of the coming crop is ascertained. Raw and refined sugars are rising in the Paris market. One of the causes of the advance is, that the consumption of sugar has so much increased in the United States that they not only consume a portion of their own produce, but compete with the Europeans in the West Indies and the Havannah. Part of the beetroot grown in France is employed in the distillation of spirits, and, moreover, the production of sugar from the root has diminished. The accounts from the agricultural districts concur in describing the appearance of the growing crops as "magniiicent." Wheat and flour are agan falling in nearly all the French markets, notwithstanding the efforts of speculators to maintain prices in order to dispose of their stockdinhand which theypurchasedatthecommencement of winter.Vheat was offered at the last Paris market at a decline of If. the hectolitre on previous prices, but there was little buiness done. Dealers were more occupied in collecting information with respect to the state of the crops. The reports, as has been said, are extremely favourable as to wheat. Rye has in some places suffered from the dry and cold weather. The meadoT7s and the oats require rain, but all agree that, so far as appearances are concerned, the next harvest promises to be more abundant than the last in all the departments of the North. In the South, where a great proportion of the crops was destroyed last year by the inundations, there is the prospect of an abundant yield. The arrivals of corn at Marseilles last week amounted only to 10,000 hectolitres of wheat and rye. 8,000 hectelitres of wheat from the Danube were sold there at from 25f. to 26f. the hectolitre, and 16,000 hectolitres of African wheat for future delivery at from 23f. 75c. to 25f. 62c. the hectolitre. Flour of the best marks, after varying from 72f. 50c. to 73f. 50c. the sack of 157 kilogramaes, is quoted at 72f. o50c. Time bargains have been made for delivery during the last four months of the year at 66f. the sack. The supply of flour in the market stores has declined to 10,000 metrical quintals. The uneasiness which prevailed at the beginning of the month with respect to the vintage has entirely ceased. The injury sustained by the frost is insignificant, but, as the vines have other vicissitudes to pass through, the holders of wines maintain their pretensions, and prefer to hold their stock over rather than sell at the present prices. There is no variati-on to be remarked in the price of spirits. Marshal Magnan, President of the Superior Commission established in virtue of the new law on the army, has just addressed a report to the Emperor, stating the results obtained by the new measure, which for the years 1855 and 1856 are very satisfactory. In 1855 the number of re-enlistments amounted to nearly 23,000, and that of the voluntary enlistments to 2,500. That fact allowed the French Government to meet exemptions estimated at about 22,000. Experience has also been favourable as regards that part of the law which more especially interests families,-that is to say, that part which authorizes exemption on payment of a sum of money. The total number of those exemptions purchased at the price fixed by the Government of 2,800f. amounted to 22,427. In 1856 the premium for re-enlistment and re-engagement after liberation was reduced from 2,300f. to 1,500f. The total number of re-enlistments amounted to 16,830 men, and the voluntary enlistments to 3,336, by which the Government was able to allow 17,712 exemptions. The number of those exemptions up to the 31st of December, 1856, was 24,528. To sum up, the number of re-enlistments and re-engagements after liberation oontracted in 1855 and 1856 was 44,443, which represent 38,561 exemptions of seven years.

By a telegraphic despateh from Buda, which informa us that the Archduchems Gisella is much better, we leam that her elder siter, the Archduchess Sophia Frederica (born March 15, 1855), is suffering so much from fever that she is unable to leave her bed. I* was the intention of their Malestie3 to visit Szegedin, Arad, e.nd Temesavar duAing their tour in Hungary, butthe illneu of tlheir little daugb.ter has led to a considerable change in' bir, plans, and many place wrhich were to have beea honoured w7ith * visit- hzo been struck off the t'. AL deputation fronm the Servian Voivodina, with General Count Coronini, who was formerly -one of the tutos of the Emperor, at its head, was to have presented its respects to His Majesty at: Szegedin, but it has received telegraphic informa-' tion of the illness of the Imperial children, and atj the same time instructions to continue its journey to Peath. The Pesth-Buda Gazette, of the 14th int, states that it is the wish of His Majesty that neither communities nor individuals should put themselves to any further expense by renewing e preparations for his reception. "The Emperor, says the offlcial paper, "is convinced of the goodwill of his loyal subjects, and it would seriously hurt and vex him should they expend any more money dter he has so repeatedly and positively expressed his wish that they should not do so." The article of the Pesth-Buda Gazette is probably addressed to the emplay9s, whose immoderate zeal has been a source of extreme annoyance to the country communities, several of which had to borrow money at a high rate of interest in order that they might be able to make the preparations prescribed. The bureaucracy in Hungary denies that it has exercised any moral pressure on the people, but some of the most respectable and loyal people in Pesth complained of the arbitrary conduct of M. von Conrad, the burgomaster, and assured me that the Minister of the Interior had committed a sad mistake in sending him back to the Hungarian capital. Shortly before my lAeparture for Pesth much was said in my presence if the great and continually increasing prosperity of Lhat city; but positive proof w as subsequently aceiuired that the information which had been given me was incorrect. Hlouse property has diminished ocime 25 or 30 per cent. in value, and almost every iecond house in the city would change hands if pura chasers could be found. While walking in the 3uburbs of Pesth the number of half-finished buildlngs struck me, and, on inquiring why the works were not carried on, the reply received was, that the rate of interest in Rungary is 14 per cent. and 16 per cent., and the net revenue of house property but 4, or at most 4i per cent. " House-rent,' said my informant, " is far higher now than it evei was before, but the taxes are so very heavy that proprietors of houses in Elungary are much poorer men than they were." All the magnates who do not habitually reside at Pesth have left that city, but most of them intend to be present at the races on the 6th and 9tb of June, when two " state prizes," the one of 1,000 ducats for horses of all countries, and the other of 600 ducats for horses born and bred inAustria, are to be runfor. The number of persons set at liberty in consequence of the recent amnesty -those vho were still under examination not ineluded-was about 200. It is estinated that the value of the confiscated property -which, as is credibly stated, will be restored to its owners, is 14,000,000 R. (1,400,0001.) The distribution of the prizes took place yesterday in the Augarten, and the British machinists had every reason to be satisfied with their sbare of them. Gold medals were allotted to the following English firms:-Messrs. Barrett, Exall, and Andrews for locomotives and thrashing machines; Messrs. 6layton and Shuttleworth, for locomotives and thrashing machines; Messrs. Garrett, for locomotives and, thrashing machines; Messrs. HIoward, for ploughs and harrows; Messrs. Ransom and Sims, who had the largest collection, for locomotives, thrashing machines, ploughs, &C. ; Messrs. Davy, Brothers, for a new kind of locomotive; Mr. Henry Clayton for a brickmaking machine; Messrs. Hornsby,for locomotive and thrashing machines. Large silver medals,were awarded to Messrs. Coleman, Turner, and Co., and Priest and Woolnough. Small silver medals were given to Messrs. Lloyd, Smith, and Ashby, Hensman and Son, and Dray and Co. Messrs. Burgess and Key, Hunt, Lyndon, and Wright obtained bronze medals. Great good humour prevailed at the distribution of the prizes, and each person who appeared before the Archduke Francis Charles, the. father of the Emperor, to receive his medal, was honoured with a flourish of trumpets. A sturdy, T'yrolese woman, who had obtained a prize for a bull, was received with a grand flourish and a hearty laugh. The good woman was, however, nothing daunted, for she nodded and smiled 9n the high and mighty of the land with extreme good humour, and probably addressed some of them d Ia Tyroleanethat is in the second person singular. The murrain has made its appearance at Olschan, near Olmiltz, where there is one of the lareest cattle fairs in Austria. In two farms sever animals fell sick, and five of them died- the other two were knocked on the head, as were three more which had a suspicious look about them. We learn from the Polish frontiers that the new Russian Customs' tariff, with its numerous reductions, is neither more nor les*than amyth. A Russian company intends to construct arailroad from Kieff to Odessa, with a branch line to Brody. The capital is to be 120 millions of silver roubles, 80 millions of which are to be raised by subscription, and 40 miDions to be borrowed from the Bank, " which is to receive a certain number of serfs as security." Government guarantees 4* per cent. The railroad will be 1,400 verats, or about I ,100 English miles, in length. The National Bank cashier Reiter, who had disappeared leaving a deficit of 360,00011., has been arrested, but no money was found upon his person. The man affirms that he has spent the whole sum in lotteries, but, of courses is statement obtains no credit. PRUSSI1. (FROM OUT: OWN CORRESPONDzN.) BERLIN, MAY 17. Although I have already intimated to you by telegraph that the betrothal of Prince Frederick William of Prussia with the Princess Royal of England bas been published in the Staats A=eger of to-day, a translation of the announcement itself may still not be unwelcome to Your readers, as these events do not occur every day:- " His Mrajesty the King having been pleased to-day to inform the Royal Family and the Court that, with his own approbatioAl and the consent of Her Majesty the Queen of the Iunited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, tho betrothal of his Royal Highness Prince Frederick William of Prussia with Princess Victoria Adelaide Maria Louisa Princess Royal of Great Britain and Ireland and Duchess of Saxony, has taken place; "1 A similar announcement has been made on the part of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland to Her Majesty'a Privy CounciL " This joyful event, so gratif-ing to the Royal House and to the entire monarchy, is hereby made public, by command of His Majesty the King. "The High Chamberlain of His Majesty the King, General Field-Marshal Count DOHNA. "Berlin, May 16, 1857." In the midst of all this stiff official language there is at least one hearty trath expressed; not only to the Royal House of Prussia, but to the entire monarchy, is the approaching union of the two Royal Families a "joyful event;" the nainority in the country which does not view this union with most hearty satisfaction is an iniitesimally small one. All shades of political parties, not even excluding the Kreuz Zeitung party, whom we are inclined to look on as hostile to Eng- elud iply kecus thy r findytoRss- lac SiMply because they are f-rie-n-dly -to Ruwsla', sympathize in the warmest aspirations for the coming allance, and few Prinesses have ever marred into a Court and country where every heart is so widely and so warmly opened to welcome her as the Princess Royal will, when she comes hither and takes possession of the little empire of affection that is preparing for her in the hearts of her future subjects. Though I must not venture on any details at present, I may at least mention, that the men in Berlin whose minutes are most precious and whose intellect and talents are of the highest order in this country are already, and have been for some months past, devoting their time and thoughts to find means forbest demonstrating the homage that Prussian intellect and heart are prepared to pay to the, fair sclon of Great Britain's Royal Family. From what I kno'w of the men concerned and the plans they entertain, I am ready to believe that the execution of them will be worthy the Princess and. themselves; but I must not dilate on this further, for, though the be- trothal of the young couple has been a public seret for a long time, the plan I allude to is for the present a private one. This announcement of the betrothal in the Sftafs Anzeig er is dated the 16th inst., but the order forits publication must have beei given previously, as pn that day the King had already' left Potsdam very early in the morning ' as my letter of yesterday stated, for Teeklenurg * very prob Aly it was imued the day before (Friday), a day on which an immensity of busines must have been. trnaseted at Same Souci previous to the ling's setting off on his many sumamer excursions, and on that dlay nearly all the 6fficia personages Of the Court were present at the Royal table. On that day also the deputation which arrived here last Wednes- day from tho British branch of the Evangelical Alli- I ance was admitted, to an audience of the Hing, and presented him an address, thanking him for the interest ho shows in, and the assistance he extends to, the exertions of that religious body. The business object of the deputation's visiting Berlin just now was, as I understand, to concert measures with the Berlin Committee for holding the meeting of the Evangelical Alliance in this capital next September, in pursuance of an invitation issued by a number of Protestant Christians of all denominations in Germany towards the close of last year. Incidentally to this business object the deputation waited on the King. The deputation (which CoDsistS of the Rev. Mr. Glyn, Rector of Witchampton; the Rev. Dr. Steane, and the Rev. H[ermaun Schmettau) had taken the precaution previously to inquire, through Count Bernstorff in London, whether the King would be pleased to receive thein,and, on obtaining an answer in the affirmative, they promptly, by means of the telegraph, fixed upou last Friday to wait upon H[is Majesty, and kept their time. It was a fortunate circumstance for the gentlemen who had made this long journey that on reaching Sans Souci they fell into the hands of one of the King's Adjutants,a courteocs and gentlemanly man, who is married to an English lady, and speaks English fluently, for the whole affair of the deputation and of the King's intention to receive it was perfectly unknown at the palace, and perhaps Baron Manteuffel was the only person at all in the secret. The countenance extended by the King to the Evangelica Alliance is a purely personal affair with him, and is dictated to him solelybyhisown religious convictions, apart from all questions of politics and government, andthroughout the duration of the coming meeting, in September, 1 believe that he will scrupulously keep remote from their transactions all appearance of official intervention; it will be left open to Prote-stant Christians of aU nations fairly to offer and take the hand of brotherhood in the common faith, and to strive together for the spread of true religion throughout the world. Immediately on being informed of the arrival of the deputation the King signified his willingne.ss to receive the gentlemen, and desired that they should be invited to stay to dinner with him; and they had not been long waiting in the palace before the King came himself to the ante-room, and, singling them out fromn the expectant throng, conducted them into a private apartment, where he entered into affable and animated conversati3n with them in English, and had the whole of the lengthy address read to him. The extent of this amiability will be best appreciated when I mention that by this time dinner had been waiting about an hour,and the whole Court waiting for it. After dinner again the Kiiig sought out the members of this clerical deputation, distinguished from the rest of the Court circle by the absence of uniform and orders, and entered into the most unrestrained and easy converaation with them, referring to the events of his visit to England in 1842, and reminding one of the party of his haviuc, on that occasion also brought him up an address. I need hardly add that the deputation will leave this place with the conviction strengthened which a similar deputation arrived at last summer, that the cause of Protestant Christianity has no more zealous promoter than the King of Prussia. Not only the Archduchess Sophlia of Austria, but also the Archduke Louis of Austria, has come to Pilnitz to meet Prince Napoleon, so that everything favours the notion of its being a family meeting, to make the acquaintance of the future bridegroom. On the 14th the Prince visited the theatre, in company with the Crown Prince and Princess of Saxony and Prince George, and occupied the Royal box there; and on the 15th, after giving audience to the Prime Minister, Herr von Beust, he visited the apartments formerly occupied by his uncle in the Royal Palace, in the years 1812 and 1813. (It was from Dresden that Napoleon set out on his disastrous Russian campaign.) After his inspection of these apartments the Prince rode out, accompanied by the Crown Prince and a numerous suite of officers, to visit thebattle-field in the neighhourhood, on returning from which he received a visit from the King, and subsequently returned the visit of H err von Beust. The Prince will leave Dresden next Tuesday for Paris, taking Leipsio in his way. He has already received from the King of Saxony the Order of the Rautenkrone. ITALY. (raOM OUR OWN CaoRM DEIDT.) NAPLES, MAY 1L My last letter closed with the ead intelligence of the death of Mr. Blandford, an English gentleman lately arrived in Naples, under very painful circumstanes. My report of the case has hitherto beea defective from the fact of Mr. Blandford having been too ill to make any deposition. The following details, however, from his friend, the Rev. Mr. Bramley Moore, who was with him during his illness, may be relied on. Mr. Blandford had only been in Naples five days when, on the evening of the 29th ult., he left his hotel (Les Iles Britanniques), at about a quarter past 11 o'clock, for a short stroll in the Riviera di Chiaja. On his arriving just oppo. site the Church of San Giuseppe he was overtaken by a man, who, having passed him, knocked off his own cap, as if by some preconcerted signal, and then endeavoured to seize him by the throat. Mr. B3landford instantly drew back, and struck the man severely in the face with a stick, thus compelling him to retreat; but almost at the same moment he received a blow on his head, from one of two ruffians who were closely following him, with some blunt instrument, which prostrated him instantly, and it is supposed that they either jumped upon him or kicked him, causing severe internal injuries to the abdomen. As there was some slight moonlight, he was able to perceive that there were three men, and that the one who first attacked him was a short man, and wore a jacket and a peaked cap. In consequence of his cries and struggles the ruffians were too much alarmed to succeed in their atte xpt at robbery beyond his hat and cane, an d effected a precipitate retreat. As soon as he had recovered his consciousness Mr. Blandford reeled across the street and reached, some men who were standing at the door of a caf6, not one of whom would come to his assist-. ance. He then managed to proceed, with great difficulty, as far as the house of Mr Corby, an Englishwoman long resident in Naples, where he was placed in a carriage, and conveyed to his hotel. Mr. Roskilly was immediately called in, and he, together with Dr. Bishop and a Neapolitan surgeon, was in constant attendance. On the third or fourth day after the attack the head was considerably relieved; but on Sunday, the 3d, it was evident that internal inflammation had set in, and on the following Thursday, a few minutes after mid-day, he died. This melancholy event excited the utmost indignation and regret among not only the English, bat foreigners of all nations, and a great number of his countrymen, anxious to mark publicly the sense of the ruffianly act which deprived Mr. Blandford of his life, and their grief at his untimely end, determined on follovwing his remains to the English cemetery His body was remnoved on Friday after- I noon to the ground, where it will remain till sent off to England for burial. Between 20 and 30 carriages attended the funeral, and upwards of 40 of his countrymen were assembled on the melancholy occasion. blr. Blandford was only 24 years of age, and had been attached to the medical staff stationed at Malta during theCrimeanWar. He wa a remarkably fine young man, and one who, from his courteous and gentlemanly bearing, had conciliated universal goodwill. Of his manly and Christian fortitude and resignation, or of the affectionate. kindness which he received during his illness, it does not belong to me to speak: the pen of private friendship will, no doubt, supply his afflicted friends with those details; but it does belong to me to record that no Englishman abroad, as in the case of poor Mr. Blandford, can ever fall a victim to the brutality of ruffians without awakening the liveliest sympathy and regret, and commanding every respectful attention to his memory from hii countrymen.. I am unwilling to mningle with my report of this sad event any feeling of a acrimonious eL~aracter. In former letters I have spoken fully oV the state of things, and I have told the truth. On /the present occasion the authorities have manifested great anxiety and have made every effort to discover the vilWlains Mr. Barb'er, our Consul, who has acted with his isual promptitude and intelligence has been petmitted to suggest or give any directions he thoughti best, Upwards of 40 persons known a8 capable o f such acts of aggression have been arrested, and a reward, withffe pardon, has been ofiered to aayi gave the blow. Indsed, I have heard a roport to the effect that a good clue has been found to him. There are various statements afloat as to the number of persons of damaged character who received indulgence by what is calued the "thieves' amnesty." One says 3,000, another 1,000. I will accept the latter as a sufficient comment on the claracter of a C-overnment which, while it keeps close the political prisoner, liberates the forger or the thief. During the last week or so the beggars havevanished from ourstreet3, in consequence of the visit of the King of Bavaria. This is one of those delicate attentions which Naples pays to Royalty. She swept her streets of rags and vermin when the Emperor of Russia visited her; but it is worse afterthe eggars issue forth quickened in their importunities by long confinement. The Five per Cents. were done at 110I; exchange on London, 543.

THE PUBLIC hE.ALTR. (From the Registrar-General's Weekly Return.) The total number of deaths registered in London in the week that ended on Saturdaywas 1,050, of which 514 were deaths of males, 536 those of femaes. In the 10 years '1847-46 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,046; but, as the deaths of last-week ozcurredin an increased population, itis necessary for comparison that the average should be raised in propor. tion to the incresa, in which cue it wiU becomme L1L It -appears that the number of persons who died last week was less by 100 than would have died if the average rate of mor. tality had ruled, a result which must be accepted as proof of a favourable condition of the public health. "The deaths referred to diseases of the respiratory organs in the present returns are 202; the corrected average for corresponding weeks is 184. Bronchitis was fatal in 102 cases, being about half of the whole number under the general head of pulmonary diseases to which it belongs. This complaint exhibits a greater fatality than is usual in the second week of May, in consequence of the unseasonable 'coldness thst prevailed in previous weeks; for according to the ordinarymortality the number last week should not -have exceeded 7r& The deaths from pneumonia (inflam. .Amation, of the lungs) are 75, and exactly agree with the .average. Hooping-cough, which carried off 51 children, is now rather less fatal than it was in the earlier months of the year; scarlatina declined to 14, and no death from this !complaint was returned from the districts on the sonth side ofj the river. Two cases of smallpox were registered; 39 ,of typhus and common fever, the average being 55. Of the =six princIpal diseases of the zymotic character, no fatal caes wvere returned in Wandsworth, Rotherhithe, or Camberwell, except one in the last-mentioned district; only twol in WhitechapeL and two in Lewisham. Two deaths -are referred to carbuncle. Three persona died of intem. perance. In the present returns are the dea,ths of six nonagena. rians,-a man 90 years of age, a widow 92 years, a man 93 years, a man and a woman 94 years, and a woman who died in the Merchant Tailors' Alishouses at Lee at the age of 97 years. Last week the births of 873 boys and 809 girls, in all 1,682 children, were registered in London. In the 10 corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number v-aa 1,523. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height *of the barometer in the week was 29-808 in. The highest reading waa 30-01 in. on Saturday. The mean temnperature of the week was 57-6 deg., which is 5 9 deg. higher than the average of the same week in 43 years. It was also higher than the mean of the previous week by 13 deg. The mean daily temperature was above the average on every day after Sunday, and on Friday and Saturday the excess was 10 and 12 deg. The lowest temperature was 39-1 deg., and occurred on Sunday, the 10th; the highest was 80-2 deg., and occurred on Saturday. The range of the week was therefore 41-1 deg. The mean dew-point temperature was 49 9 deg., and the difference between this and the -mean temperature of the air was 7-7 deg. On Monday the wind chanxged in the afternoon to south- during the rest of the week it was first in the south-west, then in the east, and on Saturday changed to west. The fall of rain was only 0 O8in. There was a good deal of lightning on several nights. Saturday was a very warm day.

In 1852 the estate exhibited a surplus of 13,0001, but losses have sdnce occurred, and these, with the interest on borrowed capital, private expenditure, and the difference in cost and estimated value of premises, have caused the deficiency. One creditor complained of the manner in which his debt had been contracted shortly before the suspension. A suggestion was made to wind up by inspectorship, but several creditors thought that an offer of composition would be accepted. Mr. Coleman stated that if the creditors will agree to take 6s. 8d. in the pound he will endeavour to make arrangements for the payment of that amount within two months. The majority supporting this proposition, a committee was appointed to carry it out, and a memorandum was drawn up, and signed by many of the parties present. New graving docks on the Thames are in Course of construction in connexion with the Victoria Docks, and upon an entirely origenal principle.

The feeling writh regard to Russian Railway shares, when fairly tried in the open market, has been illunrated-to-day in the case of those of the Riga line. The character of this route is in every respect superior to that of the military lines lately attempted to be introduced in London and Paris, but upon the notification of a call of 41. per share they have at once dropped to j discount. According to letters from Shanghai the exports from that port for the half-year ending the 31st of Decembert'sta ar stated to have amounted to about 7,500,0001., and to have been balanced by imports of goods to the extet of about 1,85d,0001.. of opium 2,000,000l., and of specie 3,600,0001.

DAxRnG BUnGLABY.-One of the most daring and deliberate burglaries on record was perpetrated early on Monday morning last on the premises of Mr. Pindar Worth, farmer, in the parish of Scotherne, Lincolnshire. Soon after midnight Mr. Worth was aroused by a noise in the house, and both he and his wife got up, when they observed a light on the staircase. They opened the bedroom door, when they were met by three persons, two of them armed with guns, and the third carrying what appeared to be a large spear or dagger. Mr. Worth asked them what thev wanted? One of them said, " We'll soon let yousee," and immediately advanced, at the same time presenting their weapons at ?5r. Worth, and demandingghi mney.ner. Worth had shipped away into another sleaping room, and awakened her daughters, the eldest of whom at this moment rushed between the thievea and herfather, and, standing in front of the latter, declared they should not hurt him. This courageous act baffled them for a moment, but after a short pause they said they did not want to 'hurt him if he would give up his money and plate quietly, but if be did not they would shoot him. Mr. Worth told them that all the money he had in the house was 7M,which wasin his trousers? pocket, and of this the burglars quicklypossessed themselves, and then demanded more, saying they knew that there was plei ty more in the house. One of Mr. Worth's younger daughters said her father had told the truth, and that if the house was pulled down by the intruders they would not get any more. One of the fellows replied, " We'll see ; we'll burn the house down and sift the ashes rather than miss it." Another of the young girls assured the tniscreants that her father kept his money in the bank. The answer was, "Does he? we shall go there also in a bit." They then made a search for morecash, but, not finding any, they proceeded to appropriate rings, brooches, gold chains, hc., and afterwards insisted upon having all the watches in the house. Mrs.Worthhad secreted her gold watch in the bed, but she was compelled by threats of rough usage, which one of the fellows began to carry nto effect, to give up thewatch in question. AMiss Worth begged that a locket containing some of her mother's hair, and whioh was appended to a valuable gold chain, milght be restored to her, when one of the men broke it off the chain and threw it to her. On her remarking that it was broken she was told to get it mended. She replied that she must take it to Lincoln. "Lincoln I" said one of the villains, " Where's Lincoln? We know nought about Lincoln. Send to Sheffield or Birmingham, and you cau get all the lot back again." The burglars then proceeded into another bedroom, the boxes and jewelcases in which were rifled. 'While these operations were going on up stairs, another party of burglars were plundering the house below, and every place likely to contain money or plate or portable valuables of any kind was thoroughly ransacked. The larder was also visited and pretty well cleared of eatables; the spirit decanters were emptied, and a bottle of port, seven bottles of sherry, some tobacco, half a box of cigar, a quantity of tea, and otber articles were secured. Alto. gether the thieves3remained In thehouseabout an hou during which everything was thrown into the utmost confusion. They at length decamped with their plunder, warning the inmates to make no alarm, nor to stir from their rooms for an hour on pan of being murdered. The fellows had their faces covered with black cloth, witb boles in for the eyes. Two of them were stationed in front of the house, with loaded guns, to preventany attempt at escape; another sentinel was posted on the landing of the staircase; the remaining five did the work of plundering. None of then were heard to use bad language, and, although Mr. Worth was the only man in the house, not the slightest act of fudeness was offered to any of the women, all of whom seem have behaved with great coolness and self-possession. About half an hour after the robbery Sir. Worth left the house and apprised the constable at Scotberne of the occurrence. This officer immediately went to Lincoln, and in a very short time SuperintendentHardcastle apprebendea two men on suspicion. During the day several of the articles gtolen, including Mrs. Worth's gold watch and chain, were discoveredc an4 other arresta were made. Mr. Worth is inmired in the Property Protection Society, which repays iss members half the value of the property stolen on satishactory proof of the theft, and the remaining half on the conviction of the offender. This daring burglary has created a considerable sensation in the neighbourhood, and alEo at Lincoln, from which Mr, Worth's residence is only seven or eight miles distant.
APPEALS. HOUSE OF LORDS, B&y 19. .W- ^ rJJ a tCU., UN THE: COLLEGE OF ST. MARY MAGDALEN, OXFORD, V. THE ATTOPRNEY.GEERa i Mr. R. Palmer, Mx. Cliandless. and Mr. J. Shapter repre-! sented the appellants; Mr. loypd, Mr. Charles Hall, and' Mr. Hinde Palmer were counsel on behalf of the respondents. This was an appeal from a decision of the Master of the Rolls pronounced in a suit instituted by the Attorney General at the relation of the inhabitants of the parishes of St. Olave and St. John, Sonthiwark, against the appellants for the purpose of setting aside a deed furporting to convey to the appoe ts certain land formerly belonging to those parishes. It apseared that in the 6th of George IL the ancient parlsh of St. Olave, Southwark, was divided by Act of Parliament into the two present parises of St. Olave and St John, and that at the time of the division there vas a certain strip of parish land lying between Tooley-street and the lands of the appellnts. The origin of the titlo of the parish of St Olave to the land was unknown; but it was applied to the service of the parish in general. By a deed made in 1790 between the reotors, chnrchwardens, and two principal inhabitants of the two parishes, and the President and scholars of Mngdalen Colege, in consideration of a perpetnairentoharge of 151. per annum, the said parishes conveyed the above-mentioned strip of land to the appellants. Immediately after the execution of that deed the appeDants took possession of the land so conveyed, and had held it up to the p resent time. The appellants had thrown part of the strip into Tooley-street, and had built houses partly upon the strip and partly upon their ancient lands, and thus, if the strip were separated from the appellants' property, they would sustain dam e amounting to upwards of 10,00001 The rentcharge had been duly paid down to 1847, when the parish officers refused to receive it, and comnmenced the present suit to set aside the deed of convoyanoe on the ground that the land was charity land, and was, therefore, inalienable. The appellants in their answer contended , that the Statute of ILmitations barred any claim that the parish might have had upon the land in -question, and submitted sbat if the conveyanco were Eet aside they were entitled to compensation for improvements and for the damage totheirproperty which would be caused; by the severance. The cause 'was heard before the Master of the Rolls in 1854, when it was contended by the respon- i dents that the sale was fraudulent and collusive, as it was alleged tbat the propertY was worth 2601. per annum; that' the parties purporting to conveythe land had no power to do so; and that the appellants were entitled to no compensation because they were aware that the laud was charity land and inalienable, and therefore they had taken it at their own risk, They also contended that the Staute of Limitations did not apply to charity lands, and was therefore no bar to the present suit. On behalf of the appellants it was s .bmitted that the sale of the land was made bontd fde and' for valuable condderation, and was beneficial to the parishioners ; that the title of the vendors not being known -it ought to be presumled that they had power of alienation; that the lands were not charity lands, and that, evenif they were, the Statute of Limitations would apply. The M,aster of the Rolls was of opinion that the lands were charity lads, and that there had beenI a bond fjie sale for value, but he consideredthat thevendors' had no estate in the property, and had, therefore, no power of alienation, and also that the appelants had distinct notice of that fact, If the Tll had been filed before the passing of the Statuto of Limitations there would have been -no defence, and the question was as to the application of .that statute to charity lands. He was of opinon that the' Attorney-General was the only person who could have insstituted these proceedings, and the statute did not bar suits by the Attorney-General, whether ex officio or at the rela-' tion of others. He was therefore of opinion that the statute did not apply, that the conveyance was void, and that it must be delivered up to be cancelled. The present appeal was brought against that decision. The arguments, havlng lasted four days, were brought to a conclumion this afternoon. The LonBD CirAwCELLo said that this caae involved a' very important question-namely, the application of the' Statute of Limitations to charitygestates, and he should therefore advlse their Lordships to take time to consider irther consideraition postponed sinei dit accordingly,
COUBT OF BANKRUPTCY, BainghautsreeA May 19' IN RE S. RICIARDS. (Befwe Mr. C 'FAN1T. A TrA I xne DanKrug was an apothecary, of 36, Bedford-square. His accounts sow that on tbo 1st of January 1856, he was possessed of a capital of 2,8764 Being the holder of 30 now shares of 1001. each in the Royal British Bank, a call of 1,5004 was made upon them. He has no other creditor. Mr. LkWRAxCE, for the assignees, did not object to the bankrupt being allowed to pass his examination. These British Bank shares had involved him in ruin. The bankiupt passed. (BEeor Mr. Commissioner HoLRoYD.) IN RE A. B. CAISTOR. The bankrupt was a saddler, of Baker-street, Portmansquare. This was the certificate meeting. Mr. LAwRANc, for the ignees, now elled the attention of the Court to the expenditure having considerably exceeded the profits. The bankrupt'o father-in-law gavo a long statement. The bankrupt had married his daughter with every prospect of happiness. He had made advances to the bankrupt to the amount of upwards of 1,000W Some time after the marriage he ascertained, to his great surprise, that the bankrupt was leading a most dissipated life, pending his evenings with the lowest characters in the lowest taverns. HfethenLascertainedcfromhis daughter that this had been his course for about four years. The bankrupt had written the letter now read in reply to a letter of remonstrance that he had then addressed to him. The letter bewailed in the most penitent language the sin of drankenness into which the bankrupt had lapsed, and promised reform. It also expressed feelings of the tenderest love for his wife and child. Shortly after this, however, he saw the bankrupt smoking late at night in the streets, and so intoxicated ao to be under the necessityof sapporting himself by a walL Finding reform hopeless, he had been under the necessity of demandingpaymentofmoneylent,audwhichdemandhadbeen met by insults. Thebankrupt'sfailurehad, hecontended, been occasioned by dissipation and idleness. His accounts were not correct. He had taken credit for having expended a sum in domestic expenses far beyond the amount so expended. He had further had the meanness to draw upon the private purse of his wife. There was really nothing to show what had become of the money of his creditors, who would get only about Is. in the pound. It was probable, however, that a large amount had been got rid of, the bankrupt having been the associate of gambling and betting men. The bankrupt, in reply, alleged as the chief causes of any misconduct of which he had been guilty, but which he did not admit had been of so serious a character as that represented by his father-in-law, or as acknowledged in nis own letters, the following :-His father-in-law laboured under a mistake that he had conferred upon him an honour in accepting him as his son-in-law, and his wife bad driven him to seek comforts and society abroad by prohibiting him frou: smoking his pipe at home. Whenever he thus infringed she threw open every window in the house. (A laugh.) Next to this great tobacco question the bankrupt alleged there were the annoyances of his father-in-law having objected to his wife earnine 4d. in eome little piece of work appertaining to his trade, and the latter having made his house a home more for her father than for himself, they (his father-in-law and his wife) ibeing frequently occupied in private conversation and discussion. His Hoxoun said it would have been better if these family quarrels had not been brought before the Court. He could regard only the bankrupt's conduct as a trader, as exhibited by his books and such other evidence as had been laid before him. The expenditure had been excessive as compared with the profits, and the bankrupt's certificate (second class)must be suspended six months, with protection.
INSOLVBNT DEBTORSP COURT, May 19. IN E1 CIIRISTOPHER OLIPERS. (Before Afr. rommittn;A. "r>u I -ni-s insolven;, a Dutchiman, whose schedule was dismissed for alleged false statements, now appeared to be heard on a new schedule. Mr. SARGOOD opposed for Mr. Salamons, the detaining creditor. i The insolvent was a jeweller, in Wigmore-street, and said that on a journey to Holland ho left about 3001. of jewelry on his premises, which had disappeared at his return, and it was said that one Stonhassager had taken it for a creditor, and sold it to a NMr. Parsons. On the other hand, it was denied that any valuable stock was upon the premises. It was alleged that the jewelry was unaccounted for, and upon that ground the former schedule was dismissed. The insolvent in his new schedule repeated in substance his former statement, and, in addition, called a witness who had valued the stock after he leftat 801., which was about one-third of the sum it would be marked for sale at in the insolvent's shop. Mr. Commnissioner Munriry said, this evidence altered the case, and he regretted it had not been produced before, as it would have savedtlie insolventtwo or threemonths'imprisonment. He was free to say that the witness now produced had changed the opinion he had formed on the case. Mr. SARGOOD asked for time to test the valuation of the articles now produced. The learned ComSsolZOER declined to adjounm the case. He was perfectly satisfied with the evidence now produced, which might have been given before, and he should at once discharge the insolvent. The insolvent was accordingly ordered to be discharged.

POLIo i. Bow-sTnErr.-An application was made to Mr. JAniDmml by a gentleman, whose namie was not mentioned, for advice' as to the mode of enfqrcing a warranty against a person keeping what is called' an "opera ticket-office" adjoining: the Royal Italian Opera, Lyceum. The applicant bad urchased the box at the "office" in' question, under the beief that the place had been opened inconnexion with the' theatre-that it wa3, in short, an authorized box-office. "e asked on what evening the Trovatorc would be performed, and, on the office-keepoer's positive asurance that it'ivoulid be played on Taesday (last evening), gave three guineas for a box for that night. He, had sinoe ascertinod that the opera for that night was Zai Travfata; that the office was entirely unconnected with the, theatre; and that he had 'been charged about 5 per cent.' more than the fair ptice. He did not com'plain of being cheated in the price, 'as he f-lt that he himself might have: guarded against that fraud, hut lie thought the re resenti-; tion hat the 2rovmta+e was to be played was a false pre- I tence for which ho ought to have a remedy. He had domanded the return of the money, which had been refused Mr. JArDmnE did not think he had any power to compel1 the man to return the money. The applicant had only a civil remedy. His worship expressed his surprisethat people should go to these places instead of the box-office of the. theatre. Applicant would not have gone there but that he belioved it to he a part of the theatre, which it nearly adjoined. Mr. JARDMNE said the man was certainly bound to return the money, and probably if he (the worthy magistrate) sent a policeman to tell him so he might Rive back the money' without compelling the applicant to tak-e legal proceeding A constable accordingly went with the applicant to the ticket-office, and the proprietor, on hearing the maistrate's opinion, returned the priceo of the box. .-ASiL,oxoUrQH.sTREE37,-3r.

Mr. Abrabams gave notice of appeal, and applied for bail. Mrt. BzDoiN agreed to accept bail, the defendant in 300. and twro surtihes in 150. each. An application was afterwards made to Mr. Boadon to alter his sentence. Mr. Thorpe was ready to pay any fine, and, in addition, to make a handsome donaon to the poor- Mr. BEADON said, high or low, rich or peor, he was determined to carry out the law quite irrespective of persons. He could not alter his judgment. This statement called forth applause in the court. Bail was tendered and accepted, and the defendant lett the court.

PZncR Somrr.-The armual meeting of this society was held last evening in Finsbury Chapel, W. Charles Hindley, IP., in the chair. The abstract of tbo report, read by the Rev. Henry Richards, the secrety, commenced by regretting that after the conclusion ef the war with Russia there should have been hostilites -with Persia and China, and fears of outbreaks of Italy and America. Lectures had been given and public meetina held during the past year for the benefit of the society m London ana its subarbs, and in most of the principaltowus in England, Wales, and Sotland. Upwards of 600,000 publications, advocating peace principles, bad been put in circulation during the past year; ndn pamphlets, circual, bills, and placards, showing the horrors of war and the blessings ot peace, had also been circuLated dunngthe recent election in the different shires and boroughs by a seprate organization, formed for electoral purposes, for which funds had been expressly raied. The present position of the peace cause was a source of sorrow and regret to the committee, It being believed by them that a warlike aud unchrisian spirit was abroad, but atthe same time it wa believed that the cause must finally triumph, and wa cease from one end of the world to the other. The official account ehowed the total income for the past year to have been 1,583. ls., and the total expenditure 1,2101. 18g. ld. leaving a balance in favour of the society of 3171. 2s. ld. Mr. Samuel Bowley, of Gloceeter, moved the first resolution *- That this meeting desires to declare its undimbinhed confidee in and attachment to the principles and objects of tbe Peace SDcieet a being in its judgment not ouly in barmony with the spiit and reqvir- enetsf othSbe Gospel of Vhrl, but as also best adapted to promote the wellbeing, the aecnrlty, and the honour ol nations." The resolution having been seconded by the Rev. Dr. Burns was unanimously passed, as were also the two following resolutions_ " That tUis meeting deeJ}y diep ores the severe and sanguinrt meo anre taken byUthe Brtish authoimties In China against the cith otb and ton, nd cannot but expres dif earnest oniichtont m hat euch probeeedThgs on the patof natons callit g themselvesenlghtened t nd R elaioes stoaheathen and aemn-b roarod, pth e, so fa from helping fonvara the caJue eitber of legitimate commercs, or of civiliatio, or of Christianity, have adirect teudeucy to disceitthe chrcterand ret(Ad the proreen of al these rt intere t h ," and "Thwt this meeting n30ices to observe the improved Dpirit of kindnes t aend concilhaton by rhich the Government and people oE Enland andlthe United Btatesiare animated in theirelation toeach other, an earnestlyhopes that the differences hich et remain openbelreenthe twoootuntiea wdll the peedilr and otisfMro.lJ. adjas c tb" The speakers to these two resolutions wvere the Rev.

AS2L5Y'S AMPHITHEATEB. Th ee i3nowevt Astley's an enltertainment so utterly at variance with aol the recelved traditions of the place that many of our readers wMill feel inclined to think we are 'hozrdg them when we report its existence. Verdi's opera Tt Tiroeator', in the performance of which Her Majesty's itheatre and the Royal Italian of the Lyceum vie with each ether, is natually played at the amphitheatre at the foot of Westminstr-bridge, under the auspices of the legitimate -manager, Mr. W. Cooke. Let it be understood,-we do not meanu a melodrama built upon the bookof the operak without the muslo, but thevery operaiteelf(inEnglish, of course), with its recitatives as well as its airs, only a spoken word or two being introduced here and there to render the story intelligible. Most creditably, too, is the work performed. A relgy musical company, comprising Miss Rebecca Isaacs, Miss Huddart, Mr. Augustus Braham, and Mr. Borrani, has been engaged for the occasion, and putsforth all its energies, Miss Isaacs especially distinguishing herself by her execution of the florid pasages and the spirit of her acting. At the same time the equestrian character of the house is not forgotten. The " grand tournament" is introduced upon the stXe, and affords an opportanity for a brilliant scene, an( slso for an excellent combat on horseback. Had the equestrian element been omitted altogether Astley's would have been no longer Astleys, but an ordinary house used for operatic purposes. It is Mr. W. Cooke's boast to elevate the lippodrame. He has put Shakspeare on horseback two or three times; he now does as much for Verdi, who, whatever opinion may be entertained as to his n'erts, may now fairly boast that he is the only Italian composer who has had a grand opera performed at Asley's. Well is Mr. Cooke aware of the importance of the innovations. Although his circus gains new lustre from the accession of three zebras and a marvellous steeplechase, he does not scruple to cover it with green bbaie during the operatic part of the entertainment, and to adorn it gracefullywith flower-stands. Thus, a completely new aspect is given to the house.
CHMRIPS HO.SPJTA . TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In the paragraph in your paper of yesterday reporting the partioulara of an accident at this institution the name of the hoy to whom the accident happened is omitted. If you will have the goodness to state in your nextpublication that the boy's namne is BuLkatey, and that he is progressing favourably, under the care of Mr. Lloyd and Mr Stone, the surgeons of the hospital, it may tend greatly to relieve the anxiety which the omission has occasioned to the p3rents and friends of many of t.he boys.

'THE AusTRiAoT VoYAGE OF CIBuNAYIvGATioN.- The first Austrian man-of-war intended to circumnavigate the world, the frigate Novara, left Trieste on the 30t'Q of April for Gibraltar. The Novara carries 1,800 tons weight and 30 guns; the deck is 147 feet long and 42 in width; the vessel draws about 19 feet water. The Novara has 354 nen on board. seven of whomnbelonz to the scientifio commission, and will principally be enga ed in scientific pursuits. The astronomical meteorologicg and magnetical observations, bowever, wil be made by the officers of the navy, under the command of Commodore Willerstorff. Dr. Hochstetter, from the Geologioal Institution of the Austrian Empire, will be occupied with geologieal and thysical Messrs. Frauenfele and Zelebor with zoological, Dr. Schwarz and Tellinek with botanical, and Dr. Soherza with astrological and national-coonomical researohes and investigations. The last of these gentlemen will also keep the jonrnal of the expedition, and make the reports on its progress and results to the different politioal and seientific authorities at home, The expedition is lik-ewise accompanied by a renowned Austrian painter, HL Selliny, who will be occupied in illustrating the most interesting points visited by the Novara, and likewiso make drawings for different scientific purposes. Alexander Von Humboldt honoured the expedition with a beautiful memoir on the volcanoes of the South Sea and the western coast of South America, which he caUed, in his modest style, physical and geognostical remembrances (Physikali8cheundGceognostiIsche Erinneu-ungen). Thhi most beautifuUy wnitten memoir had been addressed to the leader of the expedition, Commodore Wililerstorff, an excellent naval officer, who was formerly professor of astronomy at Venice, a man of excellent qualities and a sincere love for science, whose apepointment to the command of the exp edition must be ealled an exceedingly fortunate one. The Novara is accompanied by the corvette Caroli a, and will be towed as far as Meshina or Stromboli, acoording to circumstances, by the steamer Lucia, Captain Littrow, an Austrian man-of-war. In Rio Janeiro the corvette Carolina will leave the Novara and probably visit the La Plata territory, while the Novara will take her coi-se to the Cape of Good Rope, and to the two remarkable little islands St. Paul and Amsterdam, south-east from the Caoe, lat. 38' south, which are yet, in respect to theirnoctural history, totally unknown. We hope to he able to offer to our readers a ful account on the vsit of the frigate Novara at St. Paul and A msterdam from the pen of one of the members of the ex- METROPOlITAN BOARD OF WORKS.-A special meeting of the Metropolitan Board of Works was held yesterday, at Gnildhall7 Mr. J. Thwaies in the chair, to consider a report from the Comiittee of Works and Improvements on the estimate made by the superintending architect as to the probable cost of removing Middle-row, Holborn. Mr. Wright, after remarking upon the advantage of removing obstructions to the traffic of the main thoroughfares of the metropolis, said that the district board had estimated the cost of the removal of Middle-row at 83,0001., but that their superintending architect was of opinion that the improvement might be made for 50,0001. Mr. Wright moved a resolution, that it was advisable to remove the buildings forming Middle-row, Holborn, at the earliest possible opportunity; and that the architect and solicitor be instructed to endeavour to make conditional arrangements for the purchase of the property, goodwills, and other rights and int.rests, in order that this Board may be enabled to effect the contemplated improvement, without the expense of going to Par- liament; the ultimate purchase to depend on the financial arrangements with the Government being satisfactory to this Board." Mr. Stevens seconded the niotion as one of the improvements for which the Board was erected. Mr. Dl'ffanger moved as an amendment that the consideration of the report recommending the removal of Middle-row be postponed for the present. There was no seconder for this amendment, but atter some discussion an amendment was moved by Mr. H. L. Taylor that it would be inexndieat for the Board to take any steps for the removal of liddle. row without theauthority of an Act of Parliament. This amendment was seconded by Mr. Leslie On a division the original motion was carried by 13 to 5. The Board then adjourned. CITY COsIMSSION OF SEWERS.-Yesterday a Court was held for the despatch of public business; Mr. Deputy Hanrison, in the absence of Mr. Deputy Peacock from illness, occupied the chair. Mr. Deputy Dakin.-In St. Paul's churchyard there is a projecting house at the corner of Cannon-street the inside of which has lately been destroyed by fire. I understand that it is in the power of this commission, under circumstances auch as these, to treat witl the owners of property with a view to throwing it back if it is desirable that that should be accomplished. If ever an occasion occurred in which that was a matter of importance this is that occasion, for the house in question projects beyond the front of St. Paul's school, and, if our powers could be brought to bear, we should effect one of the greatest improvements that could possibly be made in the city. (Hear, hear.) The Chairman.-I am happy to saV that this matter is at present under the consideration of the Improvement Committee. The Medical QDiiloer of Health (Dr. Letheby) presenLted a report referring to 144 houses that had been inspected during the week-, and he submitted a list of 99 places that required the orders of the Courbt for their sanitary improvement in various particulars fle also presented certificates of the overcrowding of several houses in St. John's-court, Smithfield, and Blythe's-buaidngs and Lamb-alley, Sun-street. 1Be likewise drew the attention of the commiiSsion to the state.of a wretched tenement in the yard at the back of No, 5, Thomapeon's.rents, Halfuinoon-street, wvhere one man, two women, and two children lodged in a couple of roomis not flit for human &abitatlon. The mortality table for the week indicates a favourable state of the public bealth, the totlnumber of deaths being but 47. Mr. Abrabam moved that the report be referred to the General Psuposes Committee. Mr. Barklv seconded the m4tion, wLxch was carried unanimously. The Medical Officerof Health read bis quarterly report of the iUumtinating power and chymical quality of the gas supplied to the city by the 'Great Central Company during the past qu 4arter, from which it appeared that the average iUuoinating power of the gas, as estimLated at two places widely iapart, had been equal to that of 12 3 sperm candles, or 14 i wax. This was about 16 per cent. better than was re- quired by the Act of Parliament. The chymical quality of t ie gas was likewise stAisfactory. TH{. NEW PuBiua OFFicES.-An amuising story Is current with referenee to tbe conmpetition for the new Government offices. A competitusr arrived too late on the appointed day with his plans, asd they were consequently refused admission. The diappointsd exhibitr.appealed to Sir B. Hall, urging that he had inlet with4Aelays on the. road against which it was imossible to Provide. Sir Ben. jamin was. however, inflexible, and like 3r.Bagnet in Bleak- House, replied that * discipline n½ust be anainthi.ied." The person with whom he had to deLY was, Itowever, a man of energy and inventive resource: X 1e immediately despatched his plans to France-a little additionaltime having been conceded to foreigners-and tht were received in due courSC as some whioh ha be,m p, ¶pared in that country. They now appear cum m 1ii 2tws, . their author having at any rate displayed a must laudable Oereeverance in securing their admission. - ART TRSAS%uRT ExirnImoN.--The reti 'Ta for Monday, the first shilling aay, were-Aduus6i,,ns LY SeaWon tickets, 1,164; by paymest, o,235; tot,Js, ;..

TME PooR LAW BoARD.-We stated some time ago in The Times that a dispute had arisen between the Poor Law Board and the guardians of St. Thomas's Union (Exeter), the latter contending that three relieving officers, weUl paid, would do the work better than four who were not so liberally remunerated. The Poor Law Board considered that four officers were necessary to perform the work efficiently, and, after considerable discussion, a colUson appeared imminent. A compromise was, however, effected, and the Poor Law Board consented to allow the St. Thomas's Union a trial of three relieving officers until Ladyday last. The plan has worked well, and a report to that effect was sent to the Poor Law Board. That body, through Uord Courtenay, one of the secretaries, has replied in a communication, dated the 14th inst., to the effect that the Poor Law lboard will no longer withhold their assent - but as they still entertain a doubt of its practical working iuzino a series of years, they desire to express their confident re. liance, founded on the attention and care with which the guardians obviously discharge their duties, that they wiiU consider and propose any alteration in the relief arrangements that circumstances may render it necessary to make. STREET PREACHLNG. -On Monday even'ing a meeting, which was numerously attended, was held in the hlusic-hall, Chester, to give expression to a feeling of sympathy with Mr. ReginaldRadc e an the missionaries from Liverpool, who were arrested and sent to prison by order of Major French, a magistrate, while preaching in the streets during the time of the Chester races. Mr. W Titherington, the chairman, advocated the practice of open air preachnig, particularly as regarded " the attempts madeto stem the torrent of vice, dissipation, and wickedness of which Chester was the scene during the races" The Rev. R. D. Thomas, M.A., proposed a resolution expressio of thanks to God for the success which had attended the effor made to counteract the evils attendant upon the races at Chester, and in doing so advocated the advantage of street preaching, and quoted a speech made by Lord Shaftesbury in favour of the pracece. The Rev. W. Hunter, brotber-in-law to Mr. Radeliffe, seconded the resolution, after which Mr. Radeliffe gave an account of the exertions made by himself and brother missionaries at Chester, Liverpool, and other races, and said that their object was "the isalvation of souls." The resolution was carried. Otber resolutions were then agreed to expressive of regret at the attempts to put dowa open-air preaching, and giving an opinion that such preaching, combined witb the distribution of religious tracts, was eminently calculated to counteract the evils connected with races. liisit E-3rlGRATION.-One of the Kerry papers has the following statement respecting the progress of the population drain in that quarter:-` We learn from many quarters of the kingdom that, notwithstanding the present p:<osperous state of Ireland, emigration on an extensive scale is going on-an emigration that embraces some of the very best of the working classes, particularly in the rural distract. Already have four large vessels sailed from Tralee for Transatlantic ports, with emigrants, chiefly young farm servants of both sexes; and two others are announced to leave before the close of the current month. Besides this emigration direct froen the county town, people are every week leaving different parts of Kerry for America vid LiverpooL Nor must we omit to notioe in connexioa with this subject that a different class of emigrants are leaving ourcounty for Atntralia inno small numbers-were. fer nowto the younger sons of the more comfortable farmers, healthy young fellows who prefer to try their luck at the diggings rather than wait the weak chance of getting a farmn at home during the present fierce competition for land. These .uen are likely to turn oat a supierior class of emigrants for the gold colonies, and to be the pioneers of an extensive emigration from the class to which they belong -the class that is, if we are to judge fromi the competitiou that exists for the occupation of land in this county, the most iu exces3 of any in the south of Ireland.

BROIAZ LITERARY FUND. Yesterday evening the 68th anniversary fesival of this fond was celebrated at the Frehmmons' Tavern with unusual fc&z all the ohief literati of the metropolis being present. Earl GranviUe was to have presided, but his Lordship's daties in the House of Peers unfortunately deprived theffdt of his presence, thoueh it was nevertheless anxiously expected even till a late hour in the evening. In his unavoidable absence the Right Ron. W. Cowper, M.P., took the chair. Among many others there were alsopresent his Highness the Rejah of Ceorg, Mr.Thadkeray, VeryRev. the Dean of Canterbury, Mr. Money Kyrle, Dr. Mayo, PresEdent of the College of Physicians, Mr. R. Bell, Mr. I. iMnes, AILP., Mr. Macaulay, W-P., Mr. Justice Haullburton, Sir Rodericklurchison, Dr. Livingston, Lieutenant Colonel Hamley, Mr. Godwin, F.RS., Mr. Pickersgill' .A., Mr. Slaney, M.P., Sir John Forbes, Dr. Copland' Colonel Sykes, MLP., F.R.S., Mr. Arthur Helps, Mr: G. W. Hemans, Mr. Simon, F.R.S., Dr. Guest., MrBaragette, Rev. Dr. Major, Rev. C. Babington, Rev. Pro, fessor Christmas, Mr. Russell Stmrges, Air. Martin Tapper Mr. Greg, Dr. Fleming, Dr. Morgan, Mr. H. G. Bohn, MrScott Russell, Mr. Gruneien, Mr. Pratt Barlow and the representatives of all the great pLblishing firms. is Royal Highness the Prince of Oude, attended by a gorgeous suite, took his seat on the rights of the chair soon after the dinner was concluded. The glittering costume of the Prince, "rich with b3rbaric pomp and gold," attracted for a time the undivided attention of the wholo audienco. The attendance upon his HighneFs were Masso Bird Marcadoor an Bahadoor, Jallasood DowlahBaba. door, Moolris Mahomed Jaffir Khan Behadoor, and Mirza Mlahomed AI. The Rajah of Coorg and his attendants were also resplendenSt with gold and jewels of immense value. The dinner was served in the usual sumptuous and liberal Ecale which is almost peculiar to the Freemasons' Tavern, and nothing which could be done by its proprietors to administer to the comfort of the guests was left unregarded. GrAce having been sung, the CuAiRmAx gave the usual ?atriotic to-a; Colonel Hamley, RA,, replying for the 'Army and Navy," and Mr. Arthur Helps for the " Literxtnre of the United Kingdom." Mr. Mo-czrox Mnrs, 3f.P., proposed the "Litera. ture of the Colonies," conpling with it the name of Mr. Justice Hallibarton, who, he said, had quitted the turnid muddy waves of the great Atlantic to rest and pass his days near the pelluid waters of the Thames. (" Hear, hear," and laughter.) r. Justice AL.ranT, in reply, maid he felt it most difficult to express his grateful thanks at the flattering manner in which his name had been received amoxg them. He felt that more had been said than was merited, and rather in a spirit of kindness than in what he believed to be his due. He thanked them with all his heart. If there was anything which he had done that was eitber instructive or amusing, it had been becaueo he relied upon nature. In his country, as in this andin all other countries in the world, there were two great books spread before them-na. tore and human nature. These were the only studies that they had. They had them in common with others. Those who studied closest, and who approached closest to nature, would meet with the gzeatest approbation from the readers they addressed. The other portion of the toast, "The Literature of the Colonies.' would require a nuore ingemous man than himself to respond to. He was rather at a loss to know where to look for it. It reminded him of the proverb that "the Spanish fleet you cannot see because 'tis not in sight." (Cheers and laughter.) The toast was the expression of a wish rather than the announcement of a fact. It was something to hope for in future times rather than a child which was already born. It was what lawyers caDed, " after possibility of issue extinct." (" Hear," and much laughter.) He should rather apologize and explain why they had it not than respond to the toast of " The Litera'ture of the C(lonies." He would show the reasons why they had no literature in the colonies, asd why it was not likely that they would have it for many years to come, and that was no great les3. The colonies, in fact, were too busy clearing the forest and building cIties, laying out roads, bridging rivers, and providing shelter for the ticket-of-leave gentle. mtn. Literature required the academic leisure of learned and well endowed institutions, such as Oxford. Thecolonies were too young to afford the time, and if they bad the time they eould not afford it either. ("Hear, hear," and laughter.) There were, however, other obstales-there were obstacles in the way not merely of the colonies, but of the United States; not that he put the celonies behind the United States, but rather before tbem. The United States had difficulties to overcome ; they had not the institutions of England, and, although it might appear paradoxical they were, in fact, too free, and, above all, too eqhal to have a sterling literature. (Rear, hear.) Be did not mean to say that the country which was free could not have a literature; but everybody in this country was not equal As nature never made mnan equal, neither could legislation; and the legislation that would attempt it vas foolish. Where liberty and equality were co-existent, they would materially nentralize each other, and in their operations strangle freedom of thought and freedom of action. Strange as it night appear to them, the oountry that seemred too free was often enslaved. It was eDslaved not by public opinion, but by the opi'nion of the public. (Rear, hear.) A friend had told him that night that he was an old Tory, and so he was. The Canadians were more loyal even than the people of this country. TheEnglish people were the freeet people on the face of the earth, and when he said that he meant that they were free because they were not all equal. (Roar.) Some gentlemen in this country maintained in the late war that Russia was right and England was wrong-that the war was wicked in its inception and would be disastrous in its results-that it would lower the renown and prestige of this country, and they were glad of it. These men were mad in the war. They spoke thus before parties, but did they convince them? No; people said they were fools, but that they were right to express thr opindon. Let the United States go to war with England to-morros, and let that war be declared, as it must be declared, by the large majority of the people, and let Mr. Cobden go to America and tell them that they were wrong and England was right, and that he hoped England would win, and he would be Lynched in half an hour. Freedom was neutralized by making all men equal-it was only half freedom. If that were true in politics how much more was it true in literatureI In America the author. fattered the Dublic ard the public flattered the author, and there was no honesty tween them. Mr. Monckton Milnes had alluded to his (Mr. Haliburton's) leaving his country to reside in England. (Rear.) He had done so; but he still maintained his fondness and affection for his native land. He liked the freshness and the vigour of a young country, but as he increased in years he felt himnself too oldato be always looking forward to the future. He .wanted to rest and enjoy himself, so he came to an old country. (Rear, hear.) There was no literature in the colonies, because they had no poet, no infancy, no youth. They had grown up suddenly, had no settled orderM no nobility, no castles which had formerly been strongiholds and told tales of rapine and oppression; their rivers had no names, their streams had no legends; they had nofairies, no superstitions, their people were plain, hard, matter-of-fact men. (Hear, hear.) As matter-of-fact men, poets were not valued among them, for there could be no poets where there were no memories. (Hear) He hoped their literature would long continue to be as it was now-the literature of the empire, for the literature of the mother country was the strongest bond of union between it and the colonies. (Hear, hear.) In reply to an invitation from the chairman, Mr. THAC=ERAY rose to propose the toast of the evening, ' Prosperity to the Royal Literary Fand," and said that, while bishops and earls were pursuing their duties elsewhere, e hoped they would be unanimous there, and drink his toast vwith nine times nine, or 81times 81, if by so doing they thought they could honour it. In looking round the room he could see nothing which did not angur well for the prosperity of the faund. On his left were those dark faces which years ago had greeted him under the palms of India, and on his right was an old friend whom he had never seen til that evening laughter), and Colonel Eamley, who had described the horrors of Alma, Balaldava, and Inkermann, and written novels like one of themselves. All this looked well for the Literary Fund. If they could only have heard the speech which he had prepared for another toast, they would have revelled in a lxury of eloquence such as at pzesent they could not expect. (Great laughter.) HIe would therefore only call upon them in all sincerity and cordiality to wish success and long continued prosperity to theLiterary Fund. (Great cheering.) Other toaStS followed in rapid succession, Sir RoDERCiK MuRcmsox proposing "1 The Travellers aud Dr. Livingston," the Dean of CANTERBURY returning thanks for the Church, andeMajor BmD responding to the heslth of the 1 Princes of Oude." The total amount of subscriptions announced during the course of the evening exceeded l1,2001. of wvhich Her Majesty's gave 1051., her 20th donation to this most praise,worthy association. Mr. Bankes, jun., made a most efficient toastmaster.
THE SLAVE TDBE AT CuBA.-The following is an extract from a letter received in Liverpool from Jamaica, dated April 24:-"At 5 in the afternoon we arrived off Port Royal and were boarded by the rector of Kingston and several Government officials. The rector pointed out to us a daver which had been captured by an Englih man-of-war on its way to Cuba. There were 500 slaves-men, women, and cbildren-padked and stowed away in the hold of a vessel of 120 tons. All -were placed side by side in a sitting posture, and had not been moved since leaving the coast of Africa. The height of the hold was only about a yard and a-half and in a most filthy state. When taken out of the vessel and pla on trra JFrma some could not stand, and, in fact, could not regan an *upright position. Nothing could be elcited from the cap- tain as to the nation or owners of the ship, neither had she any name. No less than 25,000 of these wretched slaves are annually imported into Cuba with the connivance of the Spanish Government and Captain-General, who pocket a douceur of 2 ounces (61. 8s.) for each slave brooght,nnd considering the misery and the cruelty of this traffic the British Government aro committing a gross injustice and neglect to theirown coloniesand dependencies by not puttingageater force to cruise in these secs round Cuba, and bindiag Spain evenbyblockadingherports in Cuba, to keep her treaty with the British as to the im rtation of slavee."
