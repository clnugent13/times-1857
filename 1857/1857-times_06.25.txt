EDUCATIONAL CONFERENACE. The funel meeting of the members co-posing the conQerenco took place yesterday morning at WiUis's.rloom8 St. Jasi-es's. The room was much crowded at the commenceSnent, bub the unusual length to which the proceedings were Protracted considerably diminished the attendance as the day wore on. The Earl Granville took the chair, and there were also present the Marquis of Lansdowne, Earl Nelson, the Bishop of Oxford, the Bishop of Salisbury, the Bishop of Bodor end Man, the Bshop of Durham, the Bishop of St. Asaph, Lord Kinnaird, the Right Hon. W. Cowper, MLP., Bir J. Pakington, M.P., Sir H. Verney, . P., Archdeacon Thorpe, the Dean of Salisbury, the Dean of Bristol, Sir A. Alison, Archdeacon Sinclair, Archdeacon Allen, Mr. Ak. royd, M.P., Mr. P. Owen, Mr. S. Morley, the Rev. W. Rogers, Chaplain to the Queen, the Rev. Canon Girdle stone, the Rev. Prebendary Hawkins, &c. The CA-IRIMAN, in opening the business of the meeting, eaid that, although he could not say how much flattered he Was at the position in which the gentlemen of the committee had placed him, yet nevertheless he could assure them that he had occupied the post with great reluctaneo, not that he entertained the least doubt as to the utility of the conference, for he anticipated the best results from it-perhaps mnore so indirectly than directly-but because he felt that the proceedings of the conference should be kept quite free and apart from any connexion with either the Government or the Committee of Council over which he had the honour to preside. On the other hand, he felt very stroDgly that when there were so many present who personally had real claims to the honour of presiding over a meeting like that there might be some convenience in selecting one whose objections were merely technicaL (Hear, hear.) Al vwho had attended tho meeting of the day before yesterday (Monday) must have been struck by the remarkable and important speeches which were then delivered by persons of different ranks and feelings, and representing, if he might so speak, thevarious eras inthe progress of education. He hadnotbeen able to attend the proceedings in the sections of the day before, and had only derived his knowledge of them from the accounts wvhich had appeared that morning in the daily journals: but he believed they had been unanimous in their decision upon the various matters connected with education which were discussed by them, and he trusted that their reports a-ad resolutions which would be moved that day would be such as would secure unanimity among them, for it would throw both discredit and ridicule on their proceedings if they passed their time in wrangling about general principles. He hoped also that those gentlemen who would have to address the meeting would try and confine themselves within reasonable limits, and that wvhatever limit they might propose to themselves they would follow the advice of an eminent judge and lean to the side pf mercy. (" Hear, hear," and laughter.) The chairman concluded by calling upon the Bishop of Oxford, as president of seciion A, to present his report, The Bishop of OXFORD said that the section over which he had the honour to preside had arrived at the following conclusions:- "1. That, In the opinion "f this section of the conferenco, tbe greater number of the children of the working classes In the 4gScWultural, manufacttuiug, and wining ditricts re removed from rchool when from une to ten rssrs old, aod that their removal at so early an age In grant measure destroys the effect of the education provided for them. * 2. That fbis section, having Inquired into the causne of such early removal, is of opinion that it Ia not commonly to be tmaced to the pDverty of parent,, but, in some instancesn to objections to tbe rules of the echool, In ethers to its impractical charcter, in others to an undervaluing of eaducatlon by parents from the inefficiency of the edu- cation which they thefscelves rcooived: andl as a general rule, to the state ot the labotr-nmarket, which inParts great value to the labour of children, anl thts leads (1) to ernclo;ere of the parents requiring the labour of the cbildren: (i) to di sclute parents living upon the wages of chUdren's labour; 13) to a premature and ruinous indepandencet of life and acttou among the very young; all of which causes lead, to the wlthdrawal of the children from the school. * 3. That the section canuot express thess conclusions witbout adding that, in Its opinion, while some protection of children froir too eary labour may. in certin casea, become neceomary, It is in the imScovemout of education by mnoral and religious influenocs, ratber than by legislatlon. that the greatect remedy for these evils muat be found." The right rev, prelate, iu referring to the labours of bis section, said it had brought oat strongly certain great facts conneoted with education which could never be too earnestly repeated. It had shown beyond doubt that there was a dtreet tendency in the vice of eaoh generationto reproduce itself in still worse forms in the vice and ignoranice of another. Be thought, as far as he could judge from the papers read before section A, that poverty was the chief or altllost only Ca&UDC of the non-attendance of children at the schools. Nuumeroxus instances had been cited in which the most painful Facrifices had been made by parents in order to give their children the benefits of education. He believed that the real cause was the ratio between the poverty of the parents and the demand for the children's labour on the one side, and the general estimation in which education was held by the parents on the other; and that in proportion as the demand for the children's labour was less the temptation to the parents to keep them from school likewise decreased. The parents who in our great manufacturing towns and districts were generally most anxious for the education of their children were always sober, steady, and hard-working persons, who exhibited in their own lives that moral rectitude, the elemente of which they wished to see inculcated on their children. He hoped, as one most Iwportant result of th. conference, that it would teach theni to impart to the sohools a character of sympathy and kindly feeling between the teacher and the children; that the latter might not only feel that they were brought Into contact with higher and miore cultivated minds, but with winds that regarded them with earnest sympathy, kindliness, and affection. (Ilear, hear.) His Lordship concluded by proposing the following resolution:- * Tt it in the opinion of tbis oobferenee that the greater number of the children of the working clasaeA are removed from school at so early an age as seriouvly to interfere with their education. That while thin conference is npecluded from entering on the question of Legislative intefoerencek it would call the atteetion of the friends'of education to the positive amount of good which may bo effectod as to increaslng the age to wbich cbildren continue at school by the improvement of theechools them,elve,, aud bringing inoral and relgionssinguenoes to bear upon both the parents and children." Sir J. PAK;INGTON seconded the resolution, and expressed his high gratification at being called upon to bear a part in theoproceedings on that most interesting occasion. in the first place, he begged to congratulate his Lordship and the meeting upon the great sucoess which had attended the exertions of the conference, and he believed that their de. liberations wotild be followed byyet more marked and bene. ficial results. Hle thought it imnpossible that such a gathering from all parts of the country as they had seen for the last few days-one of which was presided over by his Royal Bighness the Prince Consort-he thought it would be im. possible that such a gathering, under such a presidency, would fail to do good and excite interest and extend inforxation on all the subjects connected with the presenz state of national education. But this consideration brought him to the point which he would venture to press upon the consideration of the meeting, but, above al, upon the attention of his Lordship, who so ably and worthily filled the foremost place in connexion with the question of the national education of England,-What were to be the practical result of these conferences! They did not want in this matter of education either speeches or discussion. If there was anything of which the cause of education had had too much, it wasthe perpetual displays of eloquence upon the subject, and he, for one, sbould only value the conferences according to the practical results to which they might lead. (Hear, hear.) Too mnch time had been wasted in talking. While England was talkdng and discussing other nations were doing, and going ahead of them on all sides. (Hear, hear.) Be entirely subscribed to the terms of the rcsolution he begged to second, and he did believe that one of the most imnportant points in this great subject of the elementary in. struction of the people was to devise some plan by which the children of the werking classes could be retained longer in their sechools. (Hear, hear.) The very greatest evil under which the cause of education suffered was the early retmoval of children from school, though he wished to guard himself against saying that that was by any means the only evil against which they would have to contend. Perhops he might be permitted to remind them of the words he had made use of at a similur meeting on a former occasion,when be said that there were three indispensables requisite to a perfect plan of education-First, that the half-time stem should be extended to all England; second, that a better system of orgabization for the echools should be adopted and, lastly, that there should be a more abundant an certain supply of mnoney for educational purposes. (Hear, hear.) During the course of the proceedingp at one of the seotions yesterday he was munch struck by the assortion that one ofthe principal causesof theremoval of children fromi the schools was, fiwst, their occupation in work ;and, secondly,the indifference of parents to education. The first cause, that of work, was disproved by the return of the last oensus, which showed that out of the whole numnber of the children in England only 12ger cent. were detained from school by employment. He did not credit the assertion as to the indifference of parents, forhe believed that the domestic affections were as strong, if not stronger, in the humbler than in the npper classes of society, for one of the greatest and most smcere desires of the working men was to promote the interests of their children in the best way they could. He felt convinced that one of the cbief causes of the early remnoval of children arose from the badness of the schools tbemEelves. The indifference of the parernts, of which so mucb was spoken, was often but another term for the insuffic-ent education wbich was proffered to these children. This was especially the case with regard to the teaching antbmetic-a br.nch of btudy which was, above all others, the most tuneful for the children of the labouring populatiop. (Rear, hear.) In 1856 Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools visited 6,400, and reported upnn 4,600 that with regard to arithmetic it was well t-aught in 3. 000 schools, fairly or moderately in 1,200, and badly in 400. Be tbought it must be fairly admitted that it was the bad quality of the schoilE that so often led te the lack of atteniion on the part of the scholars. ("HBear, hear," and disapprobation.) Reference had been made t-o the state of education in Prussia, whioh led himto beg their Patention to its state in the provinmce of Upper Caned, where the system was voluntary, bht where the attendance of children, instead of being one in six, as in Prussia, was one in five. (EHear, hear.) In conclusion, he would only expTess his earnest wish that the conference would be prot untive of solid and lasting benefits, and establish the long diicussed question of education on a satisfactory basis. (Hear, hear.) The Marquis of LARsDoWsxE, who was received -with prolonged cheering, supported the resoll0lon. Iis Lordship said he rose with considerable reluctan., t, as they would readily believe, from any want of interest or even anxiety, because upon that subject anxiety combined interest, but from a desire to show that in case he was not able to remain to the end of the proceedings of the day the joy and pleasure it would give him if the conference produced beneficial and satlsfactory results. He feltadeep interest in the present meeting, without indulging in too sanguine hopes as to any immediate result that might follow from it, but from a deep conviction that whatever steps they took would be steps in advance -steps leading to an auspicious result whenever that result might arrive. As in a case of difficul' navigation it became of the last and most vital importance to ascertain al the shoals, all the obstacles, and aU the adverse currents which impeded the course across the ocean, and to map them down with care, so it would be the duty of that conference to consolidate into one report the nature of the difficulties against which it had to contend, to ascertain from practical persons how they could be overcome, and if they could not be entirely done away with, at least how they could be best diminished. With reference to the cause of one of the great evils of which they complained he believed that the poverty of parents and the want of proper wages formed one of the great obstacles to the proper attendance at the schools; but, by a combination of industrial with training sohools, the young lad might become a well skilled boy workman, so that he might be able to repay to his parents in klnd or money the v aue of the education which he had received through their means. (Hear, hear.) While on that subject he might venture to state to the meeting that he had seen a singular and most successful example in the metropolis of the way in which education and valuable and remunerative work might be combined. He alluded to that most praiseworthy experiment introduced at Mess. Spottisvwoode's, the Qece a printers, where all the boys in the establishment while working for it were at the same timo receiving one of the best, most moral, religious, and instructive educations. (Hear.) This plananswered in every way, for the employers declared that their interests had by no means suffered by the time laid out in the education of their young lads. It must be hy a combinatis.n of efforts of such a kind directed to the future, and by collecting the valuable information which was always to be derived from the philanthropic promoters of such plans that the conference would he able to arrive at the moot sound practical conclusions on the means of furthering their great cause ; and they must remember, as Mr. Burke had said of the British constitution, it was the work of many minds and many ages, so let this great system of education be the work of many minds in our age, combining in the most perfect unanimity the united efforts of those persons who would be able to apply and spread their principles tbroughout the distsicts in which their influence prevailed. (Hear, hear.) Before the noble chairman put the resolution Mr. OWvEN withedto o ove an amendment, but as, when it was written, it was only to the effect that he wisl'ed the conference to adopt a proposal which he was prepared to make, the meeting declined to entertain it, and the resolution was put an carried nem. con. The Right Hon. W. COWPER, M.P., read the report from section B, which was as follows:- "That it appearo that in Germany and Switzerland the regulations in force have produced a very general attendanee ia prioimy schools on the part of the ehildren of the labouriug clsses between the ages of five and fourteen, and that the proportion of chidren in daily attendaneo at echool is one in 2ix of the population of Prusia and some other States of Germany, and oue in five io Switzerland. " In HoDand the atteadanc atechool is estimated at one In eight of the Poiulatfon: and among othor regulationas for promotiDg such attendance the forfeiture of the right of a parent to receive parocbial relied In the event of his baving neglected to send his chUdregularly to school, has been efflcalous. In Franqe one in sight of the populatIon are in primary elemen. tarY schools, exclusive of infant schools, and the age of leaving school Is ordinarDy regua1te I by the age at which the cbildren are admitted, if Proteetants, to confirmauton, and if Roman Catholcs, to the administration of the holy communion. That age is mo%t frequently U In gzeat towns, and varies from 12 to 15 in other parts of the contmtrs. " Various measures adopted in central ard northern Europe for the extension and improvement of popular education are deserving of careful consideration. eo far as they can be adapted to the cirmcstances and opinions of this country." Mr. COWPER then moved the following resolution:- " That throughout the north of Euxrope the children of the working clwses are kept for a longer period at school, and to a riper age, than n this country. I In proposing this the right hon. gentleman briefly referred to the nature of the papers which had been read before his section, and gave an outline of the progress made in the general state of edueation in foreign countries. In France they had the samne rule which existed here, f.r in that empire there were no legal enactments to render the attend;pnee at schools compulsory. They were also exposed in France to the da.agers incidental to all good teaching,namely, that o:instructing the juveniles ou matters which were often much beyond t*e natural capacity of young children to appreciate. The present conference, he believed, would prove a most useful ally to those who ledthe van and were struggling for the cause of mental progress and general edueation. Mr. ARROYD, M.P., seconded the resolution, and said that as a large employer of labour he could bear testimony to the fact that the obstacles to the attendance of the children at school arose more from employers than the parents. As far as his experience went he thought as a rule that parents were most anxious to avail tiemselves of every really good means of education which was offered to their children. The resoluLion was then put and carried unanimonsly. Sir J. K. S-HU¶TLENwORTH, the chairman of section C, then read the report from that meeting, which said,- " That in the opiulun of this section the certificate and prlze schemes adopted in cartaiu loaUltles are, from their hopeftl re-ults, deservlng of more extensive tral3, as an appeal to parents of elementary scholars to afford to tbeIr children a more regular and longer attendance at school, and to the employers of labour, and to the wealthier classes genertaly, to encourage the parents of such scholars to make the personal acriices requlste for this object. * That ia carrying into execution these schemes, and others brought under the consideration of this section, it is desirable to keep in view the fouowing principlea:- *- That such schemes should be regarded only as subsidiary to other aceneies for acting upon the irregularity and insuaficiency of the time of sechool attendance. " That they should aim at enliating the co-operatIon of employers of labour, of the Government in Its admniwstratIon of appointments, and of the trustees of apprenticeship funds. That they should be formed with due regard to oharacter apd conduct, ea well ans intellectualattun. ment. That the section regards with peculiar interest the application of prize and certificate schemiesto evening schoola which oducate young DeOrons from 13 years of age to 20, and which msr thus hope to preserve them from degrading and ensual habits." In proposing the resolution founded on this report, the hon. baronet entered at length into the statistical returns which were laid before his seetion, and which showed a lamentable amount of irregularity in the attendance of the children and the generally early and immature age at which their education ceased entirely. Up to one point in the historY of manufactures there seemed as if there would have been no omployment for women and children, while now it almost looked as if men's labour would. be entirely excluded from our factories. The public were apt to complain too often of the expense of education, without looking at what its neglect cost them in the shape of crime and pauperitm. Their merely repressive and punitive schemes were more expensive than almost any system of national education. 'They spent annually on the police, on prosecutions, on prisons, convicts, and transportation, no less than 3,39d,726 ,,or in roand numbers, 3,.500,0001. The number of persons committed for trial annually was 25,000, which upwards of 20,000 were charged with fraud and thet;t and of the 76,000 summary conviotions 25,000 also were guilty of theft. How much, then, did it cost the country to keep these thieves, especially when they recollected that each thief stole weeldy to the value of at least a pound, andthat, according to police estimates, five years was the average time that such a man practised his vocation with impunity I WVhen they thought of this amount of crime, which, one way or the other, cost them upwards of 6,000,ooo0. per annum, and.of the more than 4 per cent. which on a population of 19,000,t 00 was levied in England and Wales for the maintenanco of paupers, they would see that they hada frind on which to draw for the education planswhich would afford them amply sufficient, without at all endangering the commercial or manufacturing supremacy of this kingdom. (Hear, hear.) He begged in conclusion to propose the third resolution:- Thint registration, certificate, and prize schemes have been shown to have been spplied in certain localitie with advantage, aud to be v ortY of more extensive triaL" Ir. BAINES, of Leeds, seconded and the Rev. Canon GIRDLESTONE supported the resolution, which was put and carried nem. con. The Very Rev. the Dean of SALSsruRy submitted the report of sootion D, which said,- " That in the opinion of this section the careful examination of the results of instruction in good half-time schools, a3 compared with the results of instruction for the ordinary fuU tirtie in the same or the like sobools, is fraught with important results affecting cho whole scheme for the labouriug clasves. That iu large factories or farms the sstem of relays is advisa!be each ha'f-day: but that, under circumstances of practical diilicnlty, the alternate day or week would be preterable. That It is exuadient to encourage night schools as plac's of primary or secondary instraction, in which subjects having relation to the spedcfi labour of the locality shorild be taught by oertifeated or other competent masters. The section believes that the establishlaent of evening schools of t8isclasa wiU domuch towards remedying the deficient state of edunstion among both the younger and adult membera of the workinug classes That if the voluntary systew ia to be worked with suocess an appeal most, in the fist instance, be addresveS to employers, whose preference ot Instiuction will, by stamping a material valae upon education, materiAlly tend to secure the co-operation of parents'.' At this stage of the proceeding the noble Chairman announ ced his regret at being obliged to quit the meeting, in order to attend a Cabinet Council, anid withdrew with the Marquis of Lansidowie, leaving the Right Ron. W. Cowper to fill the chair. Thu Dearn of SAL1SBURY then proposed- "That the v4luntary half-time Echemer have been with mfuoees adopted in certain localities, and may be recommended for further The very rev. speaker briefly stated that the failure of the general system of education hitherto in practice had ori. ginated in too many cases in the inefficiency of the teachers, or it was generally found that when the system of instrmc. tion was efficient the attendance at the schools was invariabl; good. The principle of the half-time scheme, by which education and induatrial occupation might be so well combined, was, he believed, one of the best that could he devised for promoting the general advancement of education among the children of the working classes. Mr. S. MORLEY seconded the resolution in afew energetio remarks, in the course of which he advocated the voluntary principle, and hGped the day %. ouid never co:;e when the policeman would stand at the door of their schools to enFarec attendance upon that which the working classes, if properly tmined, should regard as their greatest boon. Thno lean of BRiSTOI, broulght up the report from sea. ion 13, which gave an elaborate outline of the papers read. It concluded as follows.- " Tha inasmuch as industrial training Is calclated-I, to impat to the children of the woridng classes babit3 of indcwty; 2, to qualify them by manual exercise for manuas employments, which "re those by Rbxch they are afterwards to live; 3, to enlist the sympathies of the parents bs js usefA, praotical, and remuuerAtive tendency, and thus inducatbem tokeep thei r cbildren looger at achooi, it is desirable to enoDurago to the utmoEt the IntroductIon of the industral element in our schools for the workieg classes." The very rev. gentleman proposed,- " That this conference consders the encouragement of Industrili education in elemen-ary schools. espoistly among girls, to be very dosisable, and that such instructionis pecaliarly important in the reformation of juvenile offenders. The Hon, and Rev. G. M. YoREl seconded the report and resolution, and referred to the compulsion which wa3 exercised over parents by the refusal of guardians and maiters of workhouses to afford any relief to such workmen as kept their children at school beyond the age of nine or ten years old. He believed that they would never obtain any sound or effective sysitem of training until the chool and the work. thop were united together. Mr. JEUNGBEI SvIjOics briefly supported the report and resolution, which were put and carred. The Bishop of Sonos. and MAlg, in proposing the last resolution, said ho considered it had been foly proved that the period which was given to the instruction of tho young was far too little. That evil arose partly from the indifference of parents, partly from their vices, paztly from the insficiency of the education offered, and partly by the bribes which were placed before parents by the employment of their childreii in the labour market. He trusted that one of the great results of the conferences would be to induce public opinion to act in these respects, and effect a reform both among the parents of the children, their employers, and their teachers. He moved- "That this conference be now adjourned, and that itbe referredto tho general committee to prepare 'nd publieh a public report or the proceedings, with a seleotion of the papers, anw determine as to the time and place of its next meeting.' Mr. C. H. BRACEBRBDGE seconded the resolution, The Rev. G. S. BULL, rector of St. Thomas's, Birmingham, moved the following addition to the resolution as ani amUendment:- " That it Is moet destrable that tho iullest and most accurate investigation of the subjecto b:ought before tho conference should be continued, and that all suitable and poseibe remedies should be dis- mssed; but, seeing that this conference is by its ConBtitatton and form of invitation prevented from the discuasicn of legislative megsures, it is expedient in any future meetings of tho conference to admit of the fullest discussion of every means that may be suitable to extend the opportunities ot a Ohristan education.n He said it could scarcely be called an open conference if those who were allowed to speak spoke all in favour of the voluntary system, while those who did not object to legislative interference were prohibited from saying anything In reply. It was the Irishman's reciprocity,-all on one side. (Laughter.) If no allusions to legislative interference were allowed, while those for the voluntary system gave scope to their remarks, very many would be reluctantly compel led to refrain from attending the proceedings of the conference, or evento take other steps to defend their own views and rinciples. In any case, in moving his amendment he felt he was doing a duty which he owed to himself, to many rev. friends, and even to aome right rev. prelates. The Rev. Dr. BAvLEY seconded the amendment, A. long and rather izregular discussion ensued, the smpporters of the amendment contending that some of the resolutions, and, above all, some of the remarks made by Mr. Samuel Morley, were hostile to the principle of legislative enactment withrogard to education. Mr. MORLEY bnefly oxplained his observations, and expressed his regret at having said anything calculated to impugn the principles of any of his hearers; and, further conciliatory addresses basing been made on both sides, The Rev. Mr. BuLL withdrew his amendment, on the understanding that upon future occasions the supporters of the voluntary principle would abstain from comments against legislational enactments in favour of education. The orinal motion of the Bishop of Sodor and Man was then put, and carried unanimously. A vote of thanks was then passed by acclamation to the Earl Granville an d Mrz. Co w per, and the proceedings ter- We think it right to state that the person who sat at the reporters' table yestesdsy taking notes of the proceedings, and wrho tried to take a still more prominent part in them, by proposing an amendment and voting for and ag,ainst resolutions, was not connected wzith the public press.
MR. BENEDICT'S CONCERTS. A crowded and brilliant audience assembled in Her Maiesty's Theatre yesterday afternoon at the second of Mir. Benedibts series of three concerts, which, considering the unusual variety of attractions comprised in the programmes, have a just right to the denomination of "g rand." The selection on the present occasion caUed into request the talents of the whole of Mr. Lumley's company, whose performances were still more welcome than before, since they were not limited to backnied songs, duets, &c. in the popular operas of the hour. A chain of pieces from Gluck's uustly neglected Orfco, for example, in which the part of Orfeo was sustained by Alboni, excited the utmost interest and afforded unqualified gratification. This great singer, in the scene (with chorus) " Chi mai dell Erebo," and the more familiarnrecitativeandair "Chofarb.senla Euridicel" displayed her powers to signal advantage, shining as much in the first by her forcible declamation as in the lat by the unrivalled quality of hervoice and her admirable vocal expression. The melodious chorus "Vienni a Regni del riposo" was also given. Themusic of Gluck is now too rarely heard; managers will not venture to revive it at our lyrical theatres, and the only chanco of hearing it is in the concert-room. Such genial and beautiful inspirations, however, are not destined for obUvion - and every lover of music must be grateful to Mr. Benedict for the opportunity of listening to some fragments thus well performed, which only created an ardent desire for more. Three trios-- all good in their way, the first and last especially-brought forward other members of the "troop." That of Meyerbeer (for bas-es) from his forgotten opera AVargkerita d'Anjou, is always heard with pleasure when given with such spirit and precision as by Signors Bene. ventano, VialettL, and Belletti. Verdi's "To sol quest' anima" by Mademoiselle Spezia and Signors Giuglini and Corsi) is perhaps the best concerted piece in his feeble Attila - while the famous " Lo faccio un inchino," which was sung with capital effect by Mademoiselles Piccolomini, Ortolani, and Spezia, is one of the raciest emanations from the pen of Cimarosa, composer of 100 operas, and the worthies' predecessor of Rossini. How Mademoiselle Ortolani executes the polacca from I Puritsani we need not remind those who have witnessed the ilast of Bellni's operasat Her Majesty's Theatre this season; nor is it necessary to say one word about Signor Giuglni's exquisite manner of singing the familiar romance in the fnnal scene of La Favorita, which obtained the greatest applause and an unanimous recall firom the audience. The same popular artist also distinguished himself in a new romance entitled " ldesio," a graceful composition from the pen of Signor.Bonetti the conductor ; while that universa favourite, Mademoiselle Piccolomini, made her first essay in the English language through the medium of Mr. Balfe's popular ballad, " I drgeamt that I dwelt in marble halls," to which, by the most fervid and an mated expression, she imparted almost a nevw character. Among the other vocal pieces was an air with variations from an unknown opera called Pietro il G-rande, the composition of Signor Vaccaj, one of the three Italian musicians (the other two being Zingarelli and Bellini) who set more or less questionable versions of Romeo and Juliet. Tho variations under notice are extremely effective, and were executed by the new tenor, Signor Belart, with extraordinary agility and cleveruess, producing so marked an impression upon the house as to win the only encore of the day. If Signor Belart can sing other music as well as this, r. Lumley may regard him as a valuable acquisition. The JinaJe to the first act of Don Giovanni, with all the "scenic effects'-the principal personages being sustained by the usual artists-was another~ "feature'? in this varied enter- Mr. Benedict was again ultra-modest, presenting his patrons with only three specimens of his composition-the a1imated and brilliantly instrumented overture to the NinnesiNger, which was played with great vigour and precison by the band; the elegant ballad, "'Tis sad thus to fall," from the opera of fThe Gipsy's Warhing, sung in a chaste and unaffected style by Mr. Charles Braham ; and the serenade of students (for chorus) from the same opera. As a performer Mlr. Benedict appeared once, selecting for display the erudite duet of Moscheles for two pianofortes, entitled (somewhat unaccounrably) Hownatage a Handel, in which he was supported by Mr. Lindsay Sloper. The execution was masterly on both hands. There were also a slow movement for two violoncellos, composed by Signor Piatti, and played to perfection ly that eminent i.rtist in conjunction with Signor Pezze (principal violoncellistin the band of Her Majesty'sTheatre), aperforuner of unquestionablermerit; two movements from a violin concerto of Signor Bazzini, rather fantastically written and very fantasticaly executed by the composer; the familiar Carnival de Venise of Signor Bottesini, whose wonderful command of the double-bass might-notwithstanding the applause and recall with which he was honoured-have been exhibited in music of a less exclusively grotesque character; and, last and best, Mendelssohn's superb concerto in G minor (entire) for pianoforte and orchestra-a composition which the oftener it is heard the greater delight it must confer, more especially when performed so magnificently as on the present occasion by Miss Arabella Goddard, who obtained and deserved-fer clasical taste no less than her faultless expression and execution considered -flattering demonstrations of approval from all parts of the house, and one of the most genuine artidtc successes of the morning. Mlr. Benedict presided in the orchestra with his accustomed ability, and was ably seconded by Signor Bonetti, who directed the Italian operatic pieces. The audience seemed enchanted with the concert from beginming to end.
SLOCKIG DEATH.,-A young lad of 18 years of age, named Jame.s M'Geechen, a tollkeeper on the Great Western road, Botanic Gardens, Glasgow, was drowned on .Sunday evening under the following melancholy circum. stances in the old quaary in the vicinity :-Having sprtng from the bank into the water in the quarry hole, he swam about for a few minutes, when, growing tired with the exertion, he dropped his feet and stood upright. The bottom of the quarry beinig compossd of soft thick mud, his feet stuck tirmly in it, and his struggles to extricate himself only caused him to sink deeper. At first the water reached only so high as his breast, but gradually he sunk until it reached his lips, and at length covered him. Life, of course, was over as soon as the water ascended above his nostril, and all assistauce was then vain. A passer-by. however, attracted partly by the cries of the unforttnate young man, and those of a woman who had arrived at the quarry just as he was On the point of sinking beneath the water, stripped off his clothes and plunged in to rescue hi.. After considerable difficulty and no small danger he got the body on the bank, and every aid that could be had WaS rendered to restore the yoUng lad to consciousness, but, of course} without avail.-dfanckester GuGrciiano

There were excursion trains from Leeds, Bradford, Halifax' Huddersfield, Liverpool, Southport, Preston, and Staffordthire, bat they did not bring a great number of passengers. AmUOg the visitors were Earl Grey, the Earl and Countess of Colchester, and the Hon. S. Spring Rice and Mrs. Rice. On Tuesday there was a similar number of visitor, two special trains having arrived from Sbrewsbury and Wellington, under the direction of Mr. Houlston, with about 1,500 passengers, including the members of the Shrewsbury Provident Society and their friends. Amongthe arrivals on Tuesday at the Art Treasures Hotel, on & visit to the Exhibition, were Count Bernstorff and lady, with other members of thePrassianEmb3ssy. The returns for Taesday were as follows:-admisgionsby season tickets, 1,140; on payment, 6,352-total, 7,492. Of these 3,033 arrived by railway.

BAILWA Y IN2ELLIGEzYCE. THE GRE&T NORTHERN, AND MANCHESTER, RTTR-.lTRT.71 A,T's T.T-'lnT tNTTO- In The Ti7ne3 of Monday it was announced that an im; ortant arrangement had been made between the directors f these companies, by which a new route to London would e opened to the traffic from Manchester and the neighbour. hood,vid Sheffield, to the junction with the Great N-orthern et Retford. The distance between Manchester and Liveryool by this route is stated to be only eight miles further than by the London and NorthWestern. In a circular issued yesterday to the sharebolders the directors of the Mlanchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Company state, that owing to a breach of the agreement of July, 1854, on the part of the London and North-Western Railway Company, they have been compelled to give that company notice that it is at an end. Under these circumstances they bave negotiated an agreement with the Great Northern, of which the following is a copy, and which they recommend the shareholders to sanction, believing that its adoption will be of great advantage to the company:- 1. That applicAtion should be made to Parliament to empower trafflo arrangements between the two c-tmpanine, at the joint expense of the two companie. Notice to be at onre given to that effect, and appUcation to he made In the next sesin of Parliament. "-2.

' 3. That the two companie do aid and asist each other in every Possalo way, as itthe whole concerns of both companies were analgamated, and that every posible facility be gitven by eitber pasty to develope and increase the traffic of both. "4, in any additional capital spent by the Manche3ter, Sheffled. and Lincolnehire Company, with the assent of the Great Northern Railway Compny,. in order to accommodate increase of through traffic, S per cent. be aUowed out or the receipts of joint trafflc to the aties fmding the capItal " 5. That this seresment shall be for 50 years, "5. That neither company, party to this agreement, shall mako any bargain, treaty, agreement, or arraugement with any other company. ordo any act wbich can In any way, directly or indirectly, affect the traffic of the other oomipany, or prejudioe this agreement, without the consent of the said other company party hereto. "I , That a joint oommittee of three directors of each of the two companies hih have the charge of the working out of this agreement, with Po wer to crll in a chairman unconnected with the trafflo of either company (say a ba,rieter of good prastice, or other publc man of good standing), summarily to settle any dispute that maay arise 8. That the two companies, parties heret3, haU do all In their power to develoep through tr;fflC in competitio. with other companwis- " 9.

That iffrom severe competition ret on foot In consequence ot this agreement, or from other exoeDtional or temporary causes, thl gros traffic for the time being of the Manbhester, Sheffield, and Lineol-shire Company shall fall below £10,000 per week, thea, in such cage, the mileage proportSon of the traffic from places west of Sheffield with London shall be extended so as to make up, as far as practicablo and legal. such defidency Eo exceptilonally occurring (the vwrking expenses of the Great Northern Company being irst deducted): but that anyurm orscnea so paid In exces of the agreed mileage shall be repaid to the Great Northern Company by a proportionate reduct'on of the agreed mileages so soon as the Mauchester. Sheffield, and Lincoishire Company's recelpts shllU amount to £11,000 per woekl' EDLNBURGH, PERTH, AND DUNDEE. A speoial meeting of this company was held at Edinburgh onTuesday for tho purpose of considering the Bflls now'oefore Parliament authorizing branch rallwaysto be made by independent companies, from the Markinch 6tation to Leslie and Anubmuty hi ills, and from Lumphinans, on the Thornton and Dunfermline brauch, to Kinross aud Kingseat. Mr. Balfour, the chairman, presided, and proposed resolutions approving the Bills so far as they related to the proposed working agreements with this company, and which, he said, were founded on the same principle as that which had been in successfdl operation for some years with the St. Andrew's Company, The Leslie Railway would be about six miles long, and the capital was 35,0001., with 11,000!. of borrowing powersm The Kinrossahire Railway woLId be 10, miles in length, and the capital fi3,0001., with about 17,7d0(M of borrowing powers. This last line would be an Important feeder to the Dunfermline branch, and would nerve still further to open up the coal diserict there. The rival line of the Fife and Kinrosm Company, which had proposed to run a nearly parallel line with theirs between Kinross and DunfercAline, would end at Kinross, and next year application would be made for power to connect both lines at Kinross and have a joint station there, so as to interchange the traffic of the two lines, and thus, instead of competing, make them connecting lines. The resolutions were seconded by Sir J. BUlRNErT, and m3animously carried. The meeting then separated. SANDY AND POTTON. This line, wbich has been constructed at the expense of Captain Peel, PN., was opened for public traffie on Tuesday. It is three miles and a-half long, and falls into the Great Northern at Sandy. It is to be worked by a small engine, built expressly for the purpose, and called the "Shannon." The experiment involved in the line-constructed, za it has been, at the cost of a private individual -is one of some interest. Mr. Brundell, of Donoaster,was the engineer. BUFFAlO AND LAKE H'URON. The directors of this company, in their reort advert to the causes of the very unsatisfactory state of local trade in Canada, affecting for the timei the traffic of all Canadian lines, and very particularly that of the above railway. They consider this state of affairs only transitory, and that it is caused in part by the unprecedentedly long winter, which has been more or less felt by all the railways in the United States. Captain Barlow, the general manager, states, with respect to the local traffic, that he sees no probability of anything better nntil the autumn. He further statesithat "Everybody is suffering severely from the depression of trade and the enormous cost of everytbing, and all building is standing still, while there is hardly any grain in the country. Altogether the present state of the country (Canada) is sufficiently alarming, and its effect upon railways is apparent; nothing can alter it but a good harvest and some capital restored to the country. All the money now goes to Aiierica to pay for the llecessariea of life." The directors report that the amount of the present local traffic although very disappointing to all parties, is so far explained by temporary circumstances that it noed zot cause any serious doubt of a*treat astersaou IAL thecomplexion of the company;'reeewts 'within a fewr months.

DBSCBSNDANTS OF SHAKSPRARE'S SISTER. TO THE EDITOXi OF TE TIMES. Sir,-If Mr. HaUiwelI had referred to the Homets ant Haunts of the Poets, the book which Walter Savage Landor said he had been reading, he would have understood vhat he alluded to. As it is; he is perfectly in the dark. He has given us some Tery ancient and very well-known facts, but he has not touched at all on the matter in estion. It is, that some years ago, on a visit to Stratfor -on. Avon, I picked a boy named William Shalrsneare Smith out of about 70 boys at the national school there, entirely by his striking likeness to the bust of Shakspeare in that parish church. I found on inquiry that hi was one of a family living in the place, descended from Sh4k8spear6s sister Joan, another branch of which of the nrame of Herb were living at Tewkesbury. I made a strong appeal to the public on behalf of this boy in mny first volume of Vi.its to Remarkable Places. Istated that, in my opinion, it was of far more consequence and of more real honour to the memory of Shalkpeare to do something towards the education aId welfare of the descendants of his sister than merely to patch up for atime an old house where " it is said" that he was born, and I think so still. But the gros,est apathy was displayed on the occasion. A clergyman, I think of Bristol, and the late Countess of Lovelace, are the only persons who exhibited any zeal for the descendauts of the Shbakspeare family. In my recent edition of the Homes aczd Haunts, which Mr. Landor referred to, I again noticed the subject, and after speaking of the traces of Shakspeare still remainmgat Stratford, laddedthis remxrk--"Theretoo and oh shame ! shame to England! shame to the lovers of ShaksFeare, shame to those who annually turn Stratford into. a regular 'Eatansvill,' on pretence of 'honouring' Shaks. peare ! there, too, live the descendants of the nearest relati*e of Shakspeare-of his sister Joan-in uassisted and unmitigated poverty ! Severalyears aeo I pointed out in my vhisit to this place this fact) and the disgraceful fact stil remains. Perhaps Mr. Hallivell and the lovers of Shairspeare when they have made themselves really acquainted with what ir. Landor alludes to, may join him in the generous endeavour to dissipate this strange apathy and honour the memory of Shakspeare by pronioting the sebeme which I suggested, of every mian who has derived enjoyment from Slakspeare subscribing a penny as a fund for the education, bentfit, and rovisiou in old age, where required, of the descendautsrof thal-spare's sister. A-s I have said in, the article referred to I say here :-Such an estate, founded by the people, would be the noblesbt moument ever yet erected to any man on any occasi.n. Shakspeare has a decent monument at Stratford, and an indifferent one in Westminster Abbey; this would be worthy of him and of the nation which pro. duced hins. It would take away from us a melancholy opprobrium, aud confer on him nd the British people an eaual Aorvy V-n R- VwILTAAM HEWITIr. Jute 24,

JUDGIENTS EXECUTION BILL. The House went into committee on this BilL Colonel FRENCEH appealed to the hon. and lerned mnember for Ayr to postpone the committee until after the other orders of the day. A large number of Irish members 'who took an interest in this Bill were at resent at Cambridge-house pon a deputation to Lord Pafmerston, and it would scarcely be fair to proceed with the Bill in their absence. He moved that the Chairman report progress. Mr. CRAUFUERD regretted he could not accede to the request of his hon. friend, since the passing of the Bill might thereby be endangered. Mr. AYRTON supported the motion. The committee divided, when the numbers were - For reporting progress ... .. ... 31 Against it .. ... ... ... ... 93 majority .......-662 Mr. STAFFORD regretted that none of the law officers of the Crown were in their places. In their absence he thought the Government could hardly wish to proceed with a Bil of this importance. (Hear, hear.) Mr. MASSEY (who at this moment was the only occupant of the Ministerial benches) observed that the principI and the details of the measure had been over and over again considered by this House (hear, hear), and if by this time hon. members were so little acquainted with those details as to require the attendance of the law officers of the Crown in ,order to ox plain them he should despair of making miuch progress. (Hear, hear.) Mr. NAPIER wanted to know if the Government adopted the BiU as it stood, because in this case he should be pre- dre to show that it would prove wholly unworkable in fra!ealand. (Hear, hear.) In the abeence of the law offioilsla however, h huh h commnittee wore but wasting time' by entering into a discussion of the details. (Hear, hear.) Mr. S. FITZGERALD found that there were no fewer than 40 amendments upon the notice paper having reference to this Bill. Were the commnittee to adopt or to reject thescwithout knowing the opinion of the law officers -is to their probable effect? He strongly urged the nSt. ponement of the Bill until the Attorney.-eneral for Ireland was in his place. Colonel FRENCH said they had already wasted an hour andl a half in the attempt of the hon. and learned gentleman (Mr. Craufurd) to force this Bill down their throats. He assured the hon. and learned member, however, that the attempt would not be successful, whether he was hacked by the influence of the Government or not. After some further conversation, MIr. PACKE moved that the Chairman should leave the Mr. STEUART advised the hon. member for Ayr to consent to some of tho modifications demanded by the Irish members if he hoped to carry the Bi. The committee divided,- For the amendment. ... ... 73 Against it ... ... ... ... ... 103 Majority ... ... ... . -30 Colonel FRENCH thought that the hon. member for Ayr was not ustifed in attempting to force his measure through the lfouse when the divisioa that had just taken place showed, notwithstanding all the assistance given to the hon. member by the Government, so slight a difference between the numbers on each side. He therefore moved that the Chairman should report progress. The SOLICITOR-GENEBAL hoped that as the majority of the Irish merabors approved the principles of the Bill, the hon. and gallant gentleman would withdraw his amendment, in order thiat the committee might proceed to modify such of the clauses as were objected to. Mr. M'MAHON promised to support the Bil if the hon. member for Ayr would strike out of it everything relating to Sootch decreets, as he was anxious to assimilate the laws of England and Ireland on all points. Mr. AYRTON suggested that the objectionable clauses should be agreed to merely pro fomnd, with the view of giving an opportunity to the hon. member for Ayr to substitue more satisfactory clauses at the next stage. Mr. P. O'BRIEN sad the learned Solicitor-General was much mistaken in spposing that almost the wholo of the Irish members were in favour of the principles of the BiU. The only Irish member in the last Parliament who sup. LS,aughter.)B lost lus sent in consequenc of that support. 4ir E. PERRY, seeing the deterinined opposition offered to the Bill, recommended the hon. member for Ayr to press itno further, to rest satisfied with having obtained the assent of the House to its general principle, and to throw on the Government the reaponsibiii of bringing it forward as a Government measure. (Hear, hear.) It was utterly i- possible for any mere private member to carry a Bill, -ho. ever good, through the House if a large proportion of hon. memboers were opposed to it. His judicial experience in India satisfied him that the principle of the Bil was sound; He hoped that the chairman might be allowed to report progress, in order that no moro time might be wasted in Iruitless diecussion. Mr. ArM&HON denied that his constituents were at all interested in the opposition to the Bil. It was true that Wexford had a large trade with Glasgow, but he believed that the balance was in favour of Wexford. He opposed the BiU simply on the ground that it was a violation of the fundamental principles of English law. The committee divided. The numbers were:- For reporting progress ... ... ... 50 Against it ... ... ... ... 141 Mdajority ... ... ... ... -91 Mr. BLAND then moved the addition of words to tbe seventh clause, with a view to give the court out of which the judgment issued a jurisdiction for subaequently ascertainig whether or not it had been fraudulently obtained. The amendment was agreed to, and the clauso ordered to stand part of the Bil. Colonel FRENCH hoped that the House, now that it had devoted nearly three hours to Scotch law without any prospect of arriving at a useful result (a laugh), would proceed to the other business on the paper. He moved that the chairman report progress. Mr. AYRTON suggested that the olauses should now ba gone through pro forsml, in order that further discussioa should be postponed til the bringing up of the report. T'he LORD-ADVOCATE approved the solution indicate I by the hon. member for the Tower Hamlets, and promised that in the interval previousto the bringingup of the report he and his learned friends connected with the Government would confer with the author of the Bill to see whether such amendments might not be made in the details of the measure as would obviate the objections taken to it. Mr. P. O'BRIEN hoped the report would not be brought up when the Irish members were obliged to absent them. selves from the House in order to attend the assizes. Mr. CRAUFURD had no wish to steal a march upan the Irish members. Mr. SPOONER was afraid the Bill would give rise to collusive judgments, but thought it would be better, under the circumstances, to throw the responsibility of amendiag it upon the Government. Mr. GROGAN recommended that as the assizes would commence very shortly, and last for about six weeks, the measure should be suspended for the present session. Mr. CRA.UFURD proposed to fix the report for Monday. Mr. M'CANN, while reserving his right to offer a strenuous opposition to the Bill, advised the withdrawal o' the motion for reporting progress, seeing that the Go. vernment were virtually about to take charge of tLe measure. The SOLICITORPGENERAL would be sorry if the amendment were withdrawn under any misconception as to the intentions of the Government. The pledge oiven by the Lord-Advocate amounted to this, that the law officers of the Crown would render their best assistance to the hon. member for Ayr in endeavouring to devise such amendmeats as might carry out the views expressed on both sides during that day's discussion. It ought, however, to be distlactly understood that the Government would not thereby adopt this Bill as their own. Sir E. PERRY thought the course recommended by the Lord-Advocate a judicious one. It would practioally be equivalent to postponing legislation on this subject for another year. (A laugh.) Mlr. GROGAN complained that this was one of a series of attempts made, year after year, to force a highly objectionable measure on a reluctant Legislature. Either ttte Government approved this measure, or they did not. In the former case, they ought to bring in the Bil themselves; in the latter, they ought not to give an ambiguous sanotion to tinkering efforts of this kind. Colonel FRENCH begged leave to withdraw his amendment. Mr. h'MAHON refused to ascent to the Bil goinY through committee psro formd, unless it was understood that it was to be recommitted. Mr. HILDYARD feared that if they were to pass pro formd a Bil which contained a number of provlsions to which many hon. members objected the result would be inextricable confusion. Under the circumstances hc thought that the wisest course would be to abandon all hopes of pass. ing the Bill in the present session. It was the fashion now to refer almost every measure to next year, and he saw no reason why this should not be added to the long catalogue of Bills which were then to receive the serious consideration of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) Mr. GROGAN asked the hon. and learned member for Ayr whether he would give a distinct pledge that if the BiU went through committee proform4 now it should be recommitted . If he would not do so, he(Mr. Grogan) should aJpeal to the Government to take that course with the The LORD ADVOCATE said that, if it should appear ts the Government that the alterations which it would be necessary to make in the Bill were of such a nature as to require that it should be recommittod, he would of course recommend that that step should be adopted ; but if the alterations should not bh of that description he would not do so. Mr. 'MAHON saw no prospect of coming to a sattefactory arrangement, and he should therefore go on with his opposition to the Bill. (Hear, hear.) Clause 8 was tho one now before the committee, and he should move as an amendment that it be struck out. Mr. CRAUFUIRD stated that the clause had been introduced at the instance of the Solicitor-General for Ireland. Upon a division the numbers were,- For the clause ... ... ... ... ... 196 Againstyit ... ... ... ... ... 38 Mlajority ... ... ... -158 The clause was then agreed to. On clause 9, Colonel FRENCH having again urged that the Bill should be revised by the Lord Advocate, theSolicitor. General for England, and the Attorney-General for Ireland, and that it should be recommitted, moved that the chairman should report progress and obtain leave to sit again. Mr. ADAMS suggested that the best mode of carrying the Bill would be to exclude Ireland from its operation. (Hear, hear.) He, as an English rmember, approved the Bill, and he would suggest therefore that in the first instance it should be apoowed to England and Scotland, and if it were found to work well there, it might in another session be extended to Ireland. Some farther conversation ensued on the question of reporting progress, at the close of which, Mr. GROGAN declared that, after what had occurred in reference to the suggested revision of the Bil, the Irish members did not intend to aDlow it to pass through committee that day. The committee then divided, when there appeared- For reporting progress ... ... ... 54 Against1it .. .,, .. ... ... 175 hla30M'y ... j- 1 ... ...-121 Mr. M`M&HON proposed an amendinent in the ninth clause with the view to provide that instead of "'an extract" of a Scoteh decreet the "c opy" of the deoreet should he required to be filed by the registering officer. The hon. member contended that by the " extraet of a decreet" the Court could know nothing of the merits of the question, and quoted a form of "extract" for the purpose of showing that it afforded no sufficient informatiou. In lieu of the words "exrac ofa ecret, h prposd,bY way of amendment, to insert the words "authhePnrti°cated, copy of a decreet."e The committee were about to divide on the amendmeat, when Mr. MALINS advised the promoters of the BiU to accede to the amnodment, in order to save time. He was surprissd to have heard factious opposition to this Bill disclaimed, for he considered the opposition factions after the sense of the House in favour of the Bill had been decidedly aseertained. He must say that the present amendment had been proposed for factious purposes. Colonel FRENCH rose to order. Mr. MALINS said, if the expression were disorderly he would immediately retract it. Colonel FRENCHI appealed to the chairman of the committee to declare whether it was not disorderly to Impute factious motives to any hon. member? The CHAIRMAN said, that he understoos the hon. and learned member retracted the expression. (Hear.) Mr. MALINS observed that he had done so insantly. He understood that previously to his entering the Housc the hon. mnember who was not actuated by "4factions"P motives (laughter', read the very documents which he had jus)ow andretadtopposition to the Present clause (he&A hea), nd hata suggestion approved by the Irish meu,- here had also been thrown out to make the Bil operative in England and not in Ireland, so that the Englishi would be bound to Paveverv respec to- an Irish n'.- o.-- 1--.S . - ha woI pay no respect to an English judgment. (Hear, hear.) He appealed to the House to decide whether, after the House had given a plain and distinct opinion in favoar of the Bi, a small minority should be allowed to obstruct its progress by repeated divisions eit'her On mere words or mere forms 9 (Cheers.) He understood that the " rextract o was precisely the same as the "copy," and he asked the hon. member in charge of the Bill to accept the change of words, and so avoid giving trouble to the House and mortification to the -proposer of the amendmoit, who would otherwise undonbtedly be placed in a miserably small minority. ("Hear," and laughter.) Mr. HILDYARD had never heard a more extraordinary speech than that of his hon. and learned friend (MrI alins). The hon. and learned member for Wexford, in the exercise of an undoubted right, proposed the substil tution of certain words in the clause. The hon, and learned Wgtleman (5r. MIalius) said that if the hon. member for wexford pressed his amendment to am division he would find himself in a "miserable minority," and yet the hon. and learned gentleman (Mr. Malins) recommended the hon. member for Ayr (bMr. Craufurd) to accept the amendment. (" Hear," and a laugh.) Ho (Mr. Hildyard) thought, if there ws any waste of the time of the House, it was not attributable to the hon. and learned gentleman who had moved the amendment. Mr. ADAMS said, heohad merely suggested that, in deEerence to the strongl'expressed wish of many Irish mem- bers, Iela should be altogether exempted from the operation of the measure. Mr. GROGAN said, tho hon. and learned member for Wallingford seemed to be exceedingly anxious that this Bil should be disposed of, in order that he might bring on -b measure In whioe he was himself interested. Mr. MALINS begged to observe that he had said nothing of the kind. (Laughter.) Mr. GROG AN had not stated that the hen. and learned mewber.d mad so, but he was interested in a Bill whicb stood lower upon the notices and on t'hat account he was anxious that this measur should be got rid of as speedily as posible. (A laugh.) Mr. MALINS said, it was true that he felt interested in a Bill which stood for discussionthat day, but his onlyanxiety was to throw it out. (Laughter.) 3Mr. GROGAN said, that he and many other representa. tives of Ireland were merely availing themselves of the forms of the House to oppoge'thia Bil; aud were the "miterable minorit"of Irish members who would be affected by the measure (laughter), and who strongly objected to it (renewed laughter), to be prevented from exercising their constitutional privileges I ColonelFRENCHobservedthat,the representatives of Ireland entertained an almost unanimous opinion with regardto this measure, and he compldned that they were outvoted on divisions by hon. gentlemen who had not heard the discussion, but who rushed fromn the librar and the lobbies to give theitr votes. (Cries of "Oh, oh 1 and "Hear, hear !") Mr. M1MAHON denied that in opposing this Bill ho was actuated by any factious motives. The SOLICITOP-GENERAL had been in the House for sometime, and had not heard a single ta *bleobjection urged against this measure. (Elear, hear.) on. gentlemen who objected to the Bill were undoubtedly entitled to avail themselves of the forms of the House in order to oppose its progress, but he would suggest that such a course might tend to bring discredit upon the pro. ceedinlgs of Parliament. (H[ear, hear.) He thought that, if the hon. mtember for Wexford would withdraw his amendmnent, the best course would be for the hon. member for Ayr to consent that progress should now be reported. Mr. NAPIER would be no party to any unfair opposition to this Bill, but he thought it waxs objectionable in its present shape, because it would enable persons who dealt w/ith small traders to have secret warrants of attiorney, or to obtaiu juJgments 1n Ireland or in Eng>land which they could use in either country when they thought proper to Mr. MMAHON withdrew his amendment, and Mr. CRAUFURD consented that progress should be re ported, expressing his intention to proceed with the Bill on the first open Wednesday. The Csunied.A then reported progress, and the House resumed. SCIENTIFIC AND LITERABY SOCIBTIES BILL. The House went into committee upon this BilL On clause 1, Mr. JOHN LOCKBE moved the omission of the words re ealing the 6th section of the 6th and 7th of Victoria, chap Mfr. HUTT did not object to the amendment; which was adopted, and the clause was agreed to, On clause 2, which provides that buildings, &c., occupied exclusively by any society instituted "for purposes of science, literature, education, or the arts," should not be rated to county or rates or cesses. Mr. JOEHN LOCKE moved that the word " education" be omitted from the clarse. It might be said that institutious for purposes of education ought clearly to come within the provisions of a measure of this nature, but he thought that no particular parish or district should be unduly txed In order to exempt establishments of this description. He had presented two petitions on this subject from the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, which was peculiarly situated, ua it comprised within its precincts the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, the Blind School, Bethlehem aospitalto which a school was attached, the Magdalen Hospital, the Queen's Bench Prison, the Marshalsem, the Southwark LiteraryInstitution,the Borough-road schools,theYorksbire schools, the national parochial schoole, six ragged schools, and a great numberof schoolswhichwerenotself-supporting All these establishments were partially or entirely exempted from rates, and when he stated-that out of 7,000rated bouies within the borough 4,000 were below the rateWble value of 10. a-year, the committee would see that it was a great hardship upon the poorer inhabitants that so large a portion of the area of the parish should be relieved from liability to rates, If this clause passed in itstpresent form the pressure would be still more severe, and he hoped, therefore, that the committee would assent to his amendment. Mr. SPOONER said, he was disposed to go further in amending the clause than the hon. member who last addressed the committee, and to contend not only that build. ings occupied for purposes of " education," but also bui!d- Ings occupied for purposes of "science and literature" should be debarred the privilege of exemption from the payment of rates, which the clause as It stood gave to Mr. HENLEY said, he could see no reason why the committee should alter the existing law in the manner proposed by this clause. The law as it stood at present laid it down that buildings erected for the purpose of teaching science, literature, or the fine arts, and occupied by any society exclusively for those objects, were to be exempted from the payment of rat-es. But this Bill went a great deal fuither than that, for it declared by implication, if not in terms, that so long as any society instituted for any of those purposes occupied a building, such building need not be at p11 confined to the objects of the society. (RhAr, hear.) For example, a society instituted for the promotion of the fiinea rts might devote their premises ti the purpose of a club, which would be exempt from the nayment of rates by the clause under consideration. lIe did not see why the Atheunum might not be exempted under the operation of such a clause. (Ilear, hear.) He could not underAtand, indeed, why premies devoted to scientific literary, educationnl or artistic purposes were to be ox-. empted at al from te payment of rates, and he warneI the House that if they went on from year to year multiplying exe ions of this kind, and applying that principle * Wbls buiwalg and the other, there would ba eventualy no end of exemptions. The result would be that a kdnd of reaction would set In and they would have the whole of their exemptions swept awy. (HElar, hear.) Insead of supporing the amendment of the hon. member opposite (Mr. John Locke), he would rather move, as a better wray of (meetaing tehe question, that the clause be entirely expunged. Sir W. HEATECOTE said he hoped the President of the Poor Law Board (Mr. E. P. Bouverie) would interpose to protecttheparochialrates allover the country from the mroad whioh thiz Bill would make upon them. (Hear.) He would remind the committee that there could not be auex. emption from taxation without somebody else being taxed to ma e up the deficiency, and that the money given up for those exemptions must be raised somewhere. (Hear, bear.) Why, under the very next clause in the Bill to the one under consideration any of the societies in question might make money of their operty, and yet be exempt from the payment of rates. (Hear, hear.) He submitted that tho committee would do wisely to pause before proceeding further in legislation of that character. Mr. B. P. BOUVERIE said, having been appealed to by the hon. baronet who last addressed the ocommittee, he was bound to say that, though he did not offer any opposition to the second reading of this Bill, he entirely concurred in the grounds on which It was now opposed by the hon. barontt aear, hear) - and he might state to the committee itat in he last Par!nament, when a similar measure to this w. s brought under the consideration of the House, he objected very strongly to the extending exemptions of this kind, sand Iendeavoured to persuade the House that they were wroDg in principle. It was true the House had already admitt6d these exemptions to a certain extent, but he thought the time had arrived when they ought to make a sand against the multiplication of them. He migbt add that the practioe under the exis law, though that law had not been long In operation, had already given rise to litigation. He understood it was the practice for the certifying barrister to give a certificate of exemptioa to literary and scientific societies when they were entitled to exemption-he would not say indiscriminately, but, at le-st, with no great discrimination as to the right of exemptionand hence suits had been brought before the superior courts of common law with the view to determine what constituted a right to exemption in particular caes. That kind of litigation had been increased by attempts having been made to extend the area of exemption. For instance, he believed there was recently a case before the Court of Qaeen's Bench which turned on the question whether a society, called a literary society, but whore premises had been devoted to theatrical representations (a laugh), could claim exemption under the existing law; hbe the Court very properly, in his opinion, held that the certificate of exemption gven in that case by the oertifying barrister was invalid, mnasmuch as the society did not appear to be one contemplated by the Act of Parliament. ke (Mr. Bouverie) did not say that societies which had already obtained exemptions of this nature should be entirely deprived of them, but he contended that the principle of exemption hould be extended no further. Mr. PULLER reminded the committee that by the Poor Law Act of Elizabeth the amount of property occupied by a man was considered as the measmue of his ability to pay. He submitted that the case brought under the consideration of the oommittee by the hon. member for Southwark (Mr. John Locke) was an exceptiocal one, and that when they came to look at tho 12,000 parishes of England they would be of opiniAon witihhlm (lfr. Poller) that it was clearly for the benafit of each of those parishe^ that a public school should etiunvory oth ofte, rand that no obstruction by legislaio or oternnse onght to be thrown in the warA of h education given in such schools. (Rear, hear.) Ile con. tended that educational institutions in particular had an especial claim to an exemption of this kind. If a distinetio could be drawn, he would say it was only the wealthy who were specially intrested in the fine arts, but It was the poor who were mainly concerned in public educational institutions (hear, hear), and it was for that reason that he could not fall in with the suggestion made by 'he hon. maember for North Warwickahire (Mr. Spooner). But at the same time, aU experience and all historg showed that the advancement of a nation was identical with its progress in the fine arts and in scienoe, literature, and education; and he held that societies established for the promotion of those objects were, above all others, entitled io the countenance and consideration of that House. (Cheers.) Mr. NAPIER thought it wasan inconvenient course when a Bill, as in this case, had been read a second time, and the committee were considering one of its clauses, that they should discu the whole code of exemptions. It tha Bill was unsound in its principle, not only ought it to be resiste4 by the committee, but the existing law in this respect, wvhich proceeded on tho same priinciple, ought also to be abrogated. At; present, however, the committee were discussing not only the principle of this Bill but also the whole principle of exemption, which be thought was an objection- Mr. W. BWART supported the clause as it stood, contending that the snore the people were educated the less pauperism there wrould ce. (Iear, hear.) He also sub. mitted that the Bill was only of a remedial character, and intended to supply defects in an ecisting Act, and that either side of the Houte. it from Mr. SPOONER moved that the Chairman report progress. Mir. DRUMMOND uid he was surprised to hear the hon. member for Dumfries (Mr. W. Ewart) repeat the fallacy, long ago exploded, that there was any zecessary connexion between pauperism and education. Why, was any man ever filled by reading a page of Homier or of VIrgil? (A laugh.) Education had nothing whatever to do with pauperism. A man did not starve because he was unedocased, but because he had nothing to eat. (A augh.) Iet the committee observe the extent to which they were going. There was not a single parish in tho country that had not at least one if not four or five iplacea of education, and bt this Bill all those parish schools wereto be exempt from t e payment of rates. Then, again, the house of the schoolmaster was to be exempt. ("NO, no.") Then, if his house was not to be exempt they must increase his pay. He contended that this was a mo3t foolish measure, and that institutions which had produced the greatest amount of public benefit, such, for example, as the Royal Agricultural Society, the British Institution, the Society of Arts, and the Soeiety of PAinters in Water Couzou, were preisely those wbich ha6d never received one farthing of the public money. (Hear, hear.) The committee then divid6l on the motion of Mr. Spooner, that the Chairman report progresm, when the numbers were;- For the motion ... ... ... ... 76 Against it... .. .. .. ..100 ajority for the motion ... .- 24 IN was now, however, within 10 minutes of the hour of adjournment of the House, and the committee did not proceed further vrith the consideration of the BilL. H LEli BOROIJGHI INCORPORATION BILL. This Bill was rend a second time. TaE ROCHDALE ELECTION. Mr. HENLEY, the chairman of the select committee appointed onFriday lastto consider the allegations c3ntamed in the petition of Mr. John Newall, touching an attempt to corrupt a witness summoced to give evidence beforetheRochdale election committee, brought np the report of thoecommittee, and as the right hon. geatfeman laid it on the table there were cries of Read, read," from both sides of the House. Sir DENus LE MnCOHANT thereupon read the report, as follows " The select committee appointed to inquire into the matter of the petition of John Newall, and to report their opinion thereuponto the Hons, and to whom the petition of John Newall and the evidence taken at the bar of the House were referred, have considered the matters to them referred, and have agreed to the following re port :-That Peter Johnson, mentioned in the petition of JohnNewall, was not produced before your committee; and it appeared that he had not been arrested nuder the warrant =asued against him, although every means had been taken to find him, both at iRochdale and in London. Your committee find that by the direction of John NowAl, the agent for the petition against the return of Sir Alexander Ramsay, Abraham Rothwell was upon the 12th of Ki1a last served with a Speaker's warrant to attend to give ev dence before the election committee. That the fact of Abraham Rotwaell being a person likely to be examined as a witness on the hearing of the said election petition became known in Rochdale, and was before thel8thofJnnte int known toJohn Lord. That the aforesaid Peter Johnson, having recently come to London, did, on the morning of Thursday, the 18thinst., personally apply to John Lord for the address of Abraham Rothwell, and from what passed at their interview John Lord became aware that Peter Johnson's object in desiring to communicate with Rothwell was connected with the Rochdale election, and he requested Lord to tell Rothwell thaf if Rothwell intended to leave the country he (Johnson) would find him money to the extent of 501. Thit, accordingly b the ecy of John Lord, Peter Johnson and Abraham Uothwell met on the evening of Thursday, the 18th inst., when Peter Johnson, in the presenceand hearingof JohnLord, offeredAbraham Rothwell to provide money for his use to the amount of 501. if he would leave England and go to America. From the circumstances already stated the necosary inference would seem to be that the object of Peter Johnson in so acting as aforesaid was to prevent Abraham Roshwell being examined on the trial of the election petition, and that smch purpose of Johnson's was knowvn to John Lord. Bat the evidence was so inconclasive, and the manner of the witneases in giving their testimonyso unsatisfactory, that your committee are unable to state this inference as being the clear result of their investigation. The committee desire to add that nothing was given in evidence before the; committee tending to connect the sitting member or his agents with the transaction in question; and, in conclusion the committee have to report tht they have carefully abstained from prosecuting any inquiry into matters not stritly included within the limits of the referenoe made to them, because of their apprehension that they might trench on the proper daties of tho election comnutteo, and prejudice the rights of parties not rsepresented before them." (Cries of "Hear, hear.") The report was ordered to lie on the table, andthe EHouse adjoutrned at 6 o'clock. Lord 1H. L-niiaox voted against reporting progress in tbe irst division upon the Judgments' Execution. He intended to vote with the minority, hut mistook the lobby.

UEE SURVZY OF SCOTLAND. TO TIE EDITOR OF THE TIMBES. Sir,-My attention has been called to the leading articls in The Times of Saturday, in which the 25-inch survey is denounced as a Scotch job, tho fact being thus ignored thi England is being surveyed on the same scale, forever sinQC the year 1810, when the six-inch scale was first extended to Scotland and to the six northern counties of Englazi-i the survey has proceeded pari pagsu in both countries' Now, "job" is an ugly word, and, ina3much as I am in a great. measure responsible for the adoption of the 25inch survey by the Treasury, I trust to your love of jastic3 to find a place in your coleLmns for a reply to the article i'n question. The objections to the 25-inch survey urgod ln The Yimcs are in substance as follows:- L The accuracy and sufficiency of the six-inch scale for practical purposes. 2. That Kent and Surrey are content with the six.incl map. 3. The size of the 25-inch map. 4. Its cost. 5. That it is a bobby of pedants and professional men, but opposed by civil engineers and geographers. 6. That it is a property map, made for the benefit of lancowners at the public expense. I propose to deal with these objections in the order stated. 1. As regards the accuracy and sufflciency of the six-inch m.p for practical purposes. Its acouraoy, ag far as itgoes, I do not dispute; but of its sufficiency in this coauntry for tho practical purposes of a large] survey let the public judge from the history of tfo six-inch map. It wasfirstadopted for the townland valuation of Ireand in 1824, in accordance with a resolation of the House of Commons,-" That it is expedient, for the purpose of apportioning more equally the local btrdens collected in Irelsnd, to provide for a general survey and valuation." A six-inch map was then considered to be the smallest scale which would admit of the accurate delineation of thetown-land boundevies-a townland in Iraland being the lowest unit of taxation, whereas ia England for rating and valuation purposes every separate parcel of land or tenement, however small, is required to be accu. rately drawnupon the map. The six-inch map was thus frst adopted in Ireland for a partcelar local purpose. In 1840 the six-inch survoy was extended to Scotland and to the slx northern counties of England by a TreasuTy minute, iu which my Lords say that " they are of opinion that if the nation incurs the cost of a survey, that survey shoW7d be of the kind which is most generally useful" In 1851 a committee of the House of Commons, of which I was chairman, unanimously condemned the six-inch map as not being of sufficient utility to justify its cost, and recommended the adoption of the one-inch map only. The decision of thecommittee of 1851 was accepted bythe Government of the day as conclusive against the six-inch scale, and a Treasury minute was issued limiting it to those counties whose surveys had been alrady partly published on that scale. The rule, however, which was thus laid down by Sir C. Wood wassubsequently broken throughbyMr. Disraeli, for he conceded the six-inch sude to two counties in Scotland and to one in the north of England, of which no portions had been published on that scale. When, in 1853, Lord Aberdeen's Government came into office there were found at the Treasury 59 memorials from public bodies in Scotland and the north of England, praying for the proseon. tion of the dx-inch map. In consequence of this presnanr, and the concessions already made, as well as the amount of work already done on the six-inch scale, it was impossible to withhold further concessions, and the Treasury, believing the decision of the committee of 1851 against the ix-inch scale to be sound, issued a circular, with a view to collecting opinions as to the scales upon which a national survey should be condected. The replies to this circular were as follows :-In favour of the six-inch scale, 32; against it, and in favour of larger scales, 120. The judgment pro. nounced against the six-inch map by the committee of 1851 was thus affirmed by nearly all the authorities in the united kingdom most competent to speak upon such a subject, and it was upon the evidence contained in those replies, which are contained in the printed " Correspondencs on Scales, 1854," that the Treasury, finding it imposible to limit the survey to the one-inch map alone, decided on adopting the 256inch in preference to the six-inch scale for the large ml v.v_ 2. As to Kent and Sarrey being content with the six-inch map. Mty reply to this remark is simply,-They have .o,, got it. The only coanties in England which have as yet got the six-inch map are Yorkshire and Lancashire. 3. As to the size of the 25-inch map, which it is stated wouldbe 250 yardslong by 120yards broad. This argameot against the 25-inch map arises from a misapplicatloa of terms. A survey drawn or published on a large scale, no matter whether upon.six or 25 inches cannot properly be caled a map, but is in reality a series of plans which may be used for property purposes either public or private. If, tben, the size of the 25-inch map, when spread out as a wholeo isto be considered an argument against it, that ob. jection holds equally against tho six-inch map, which in this respect would be found little less inconvenient, as the sheets of the six-inch map of Scotland would, if put together, cover a space 261 feet long by 126 feot broad. The six-inch map of Ireland has been completed and pablished, but no sane person would think of putting the sheets together as a whole. They are kept bound up, each couuty forming a separate volume. 4. As to the cost of the 25-inch map. This is estimated by the writer in Tkc Times at 2OOO,0001. for Scotland, and 6,000,0001. more for England and Irelanl. On what data those calculations rest I am unable to gues3, but upon the authority of the officer charged with the conduct of the survey I a-m in a-position to give the following estimates as being strictly accurate:- Scotland-917,0001., including work already done. This would give a25-inchpublishedmapof the cultivateddistrics, andsix-inchandone-inchpublishedmapsofthewhol couiitry. Deducting for work already done, on which 339,0001. have been expended, 624,0001. would be required to complete the survey. The total original estimato of 917,0001. would, it is truo, be thus exceeded by 46,000., but this excess is owing to the frequent changes in the mcale of the survey, and the consequent loss from delay. If, then, there is now to ba a further change, and the survey and publication of the cultivated districts are to be abandoned, the e"timate for the completion of the survey of Scotland would only be reduced by 50,0001. England.-Deducting for work already done, the xurvey and publication of the cultivated districts on the 25-inch, and of the whole on the one-inch and six-inch scales, could be completed for 1,500,0001. Ireland.-The redrawing and publication of the cultivated districts on the 25-inch sle could be done for 400,0007. 5. As to the 25-inch sale being the hobby of pedants and professional men, but opposed by civil engineers and geographers. In reply to this objection I would firt stte that it is apurely professional question, and that it is to the opinion of competent professional men thatwe must look for a gaide in formingia judgment upon it. lText, let me quote a few of the names of the public bodies and scientific and practical men who, in reply to the Treasury circular, recommended the adoption of a much larger scale than six inches to the mile :-The Registrar-General, Copyhold Enclosure, and Tithe Commissioners, the President of th Geographical Society, the Cathedral Commision, the President of the Geological Society, the Society for Promoting the Amendment of the Law, the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the Poor Law Board, Highland and Agricultural Society, the Chancellor of the Dachy of Lancaster (Lord Belper), the Commissioner of Woods, the Boad of Supervision for the Relief of the Poor (Scotland), the General Board of Health, the Statistical Society, the Statistical Conference (held at Brussels, September, 1853), Sir H. De Ia Beche, Messrs. Brunel, Stephenson, and Locke; Mr. Viguoles, Colonel Dawson (engineer to the Tithe, &c., Commission), Mr. Coulson, MIr. Bellenden Ker, Mfr. Warburton, Lord Rosse, Lord Wrottesley, Lord Beaumont, and among the signatures to the replies favourable to the large scale will be found the names of many of our leading land agents, valuers, and surveyors. I cannot deny that the names of Messrs. Locke and Stephenson are to be found in the division list as voting with Sir D. Norreys against the 25-inch and in favour of the six-inch scale, andI know that this fact has great weight with the House of Commons; but it is only fair to state that Mr. Locke was a member of the committ-ee of 1851, which unani. mously condemned the six-inch scale; that Mr. Stephenson gave evidence against it before the same committee; and that, in their reply to the Treasury circular, Mesrs. Locke and Stephenson, in conjunction with Mr. Brunel, state,' That for all local purposes, such as drainage, sewerage tithe commutatIon, Poor LaW assessments, and for the purposes of reference or general registration, scalesvarying from 12 to 60 inches to the mile haveLheretofore beenemployed in England, and if all the objects for which such maps we toquired, as well- as those for the purpose of registration and reference, are to be attained, we are of opinion that a 5ix-inch map is not suaficiently large or comprehensive; and that, looking forward to the further probable subdiVisionl of property and to the tendency which exists to simplify the transfer of property, a map on the scale of about 20 inches to a-mile is that which we should recommend." Ioonfess, therefore, that I am at a loss to understand by what prooess of reasoning those hon. members have now cometo theeonclusionthat a dx-inchmap isajudicious outlay of publio money, add that if the nation is to inenr the cost of a luge survey it ought to be made and dran upon the aix-inch scle. As regards the geographers who, it is sad, are oppoaed to the 25-inch survey, let us see what Sir R. Murcbison5 Pres dent of the GeogrphialSociety, a-y in hisreplyi*jh, Treaury circular;-" In regard to the questiot.of tQs adoptionoftbesix.inch,orastir largersale, on wiehmyepynic is asked, I recommend that the srvey be made on the esleg of 24 inches to the mile; and for the following reons._ L The six-inch map is too large for a general mapt " $oo xmall for an estte map. 2. The ix-inch is too small to admit of accurate measurement of are,.s, o*esp'Wi of less than ono acre, as is acknowledged by the advocates of that sale. 3. The aix-inch maps have been foundt wholly inadequate for the purpoe of the Tithe Comm,, taion Act, the Parochial Assessments Aot, and the Enclosure Act, so that additional survcys on a large scale hgvebeen found necessary for all these purpose& 4. Ther six-inch- maps cannot be applied with zafety and convenienoe for the registration of sals or transfer of IaSM& assurances or enocmbrances of property, or other simil-, purposes contemplated by Lord Langdale, or for several of the purposes enumerated by Colonel Dawson." 6. That the 25-inch is a property map, made for the. benefit of landowners at the public expense It is solely on public grounds; it is for publi, and notfor privato property purposes that l~ in common with those who are in favour of a 25-inch scale, have urged its adoption, on the Government. The public property purposes whicla national survey should beexpectedtosubserve, and which,' require a 25-inch scale, are given by Colonel Dawson, (Correspondence, p. 32). Of theo purposes perhaps the most important at the present time is the registratiors and transfer of property, and the formation of naltional map for that purpo6e has on different oocasions beea urge& uponthe Government, byLordLaugdale, by the Law 4mWd_ ment Society, &o. Itis oneofthemainargnmentsusedi. favour of a large survey by Mr. Coulson, lr. Bellenden ]er, Lord Wrottesley, Lord Besumont, lr. Warburton, &c, because they say that the registration and transfer of property cannot be safely or conveniently effected on a Ax-inchmap; and to any one who reads the rep.rt of the Title. Rgistration Commission, 1857, it is evident that, although. the commissioners, in the absence of a national map, do not recommend that the use of maps for registration should be made compulsory, they would, in all probability, havs made tbat recommendatior if a national map sufficient forthe purpose had been inexistence. Maps upon a 25-inch scale are in general use for ihe, regstnrtion and transfer of property on the continent ot Europe, where there is hardly a country which is not fIn possesion of its cadastre, or large survey. That of rance, was commenced in 1793, and has been completed under one. Of tho wise provisions of the Code Napoleon. In this, country the principle of a property survey was sanetionedbyr Parliament more than 30 years ago, when, in 18, the sixinch survey was adopted for Ireland avowedly for propertyv prposes,andfor loa assesments. Itsextensiornto thenorib of England and to Scotland in 1840 confirmed that princd_ ple, and therefore the only question now at issue is simply as to the best mode of its application. I ca readily comprehend the views of thowe persons who take their staU, upon the one-inch scale, nd who say that a nation showal only undertake a survey with a view to the publication of a map for general geographical or military parposes, but thse. position having been abandoned in Irelaudin 182I. and in England and Scotland in 1840, is now untenable. Toomuih has been done upon a six-inch scsle, and the great nation ,1 advantages of a large survey are too fuUy appreciated to admit of our reverting to the one-inch map alone. Tne Treasury foundit impossible to do so in 1853; a fortio,4 it cannot be done in 1857, when so much more has been Mrveyed and pnblished on a large scale. The question, therefore, which Parliament and the pabio have now to consider is whether, in order to effect a small saving, ther will stop the prosecution of the survey and map on the 2a. inch sae, which for proerty purposes is considered by the most competent authoriies to be emsential, or whether th y- will allow the public money to be wasted on a six-inch map,~ which was equally undertaken for property purposes, but which the same authorities consider to be for mostpractical purpes comparatively useless. The great national importance of this question must my apolog0 for the length of ihis letter, which I feel has exceeded all reasonable limits, although I have purposelr omitted many points of considertble interest, such as th%. mode of publishing the large survey, the sale of maps, and the question of contours, &c.; but I trust that what I bavsaid may be of service in removing much of the misunderstanding wrhich prevails upon this subject, and that I hava, at least shown that those who have earnestly urged theadoption of the 25-inch survey for the public gooi alona, hardly deserve to be gibbeted as jobbers. _ I remain, Sir. your obedient ervant.

Tns EUxrOPEN~t TouRisT MAI.-The sammer hegirafor Europe this year exceeds in numbers anyprevious. one within our recollection. With the immense facilities. afforded to tourists by the oontinual multiplication of stenam naes, is is natural that this should be the cisc, and we must. be content to see pleasure-seek-ers annually de6erting our own summer resorts for the greater attractions and more. solid improvement in mlnd and health which they fiml abroad. The only counter-check th t our waterin places can oppose to a movement which will gradually thin the number of their fashionable visitors, until none are left bat. the halt and blind, is to alter their present system, reduce their outrageous chaes, give wholesome foot at reasonable prices, and discourage funkeyism an& snobbery, in whtever forms thc;y may present themselves. Begarded insany other light there is no reason to feel alarna at this continually augmenting emigration from our shores. But few of those that leave uls remain away for any considerable period fhr whatever may be the temporary attractions of European capitals and society they do not. compensate sufflciently for the more solid advantages to brfound at home to induce many of our people to make a permanent exchange of them. Whenvwe compare thenumbers of tho thtome with the numbers of those that go will be found that even if the latter were to quit us. logether the balance would strll be so larely inour favour as to prevent us from missing them. Tak the. whole of the departures for Europe by 14 dirent lines oE steamers from the 1st of January to the 31st of May of the present year, we find that theyonly amount to 8,208 persons, while the emigration to our own shores in the same period may be set down at 45,000_ For the next five months the number of these departures. will be gradually diminishing, while during the same time, the arrivals will merease in a more marked ratio than in the beginning of the year. Of the amounts of money carried away and spent abroad by American travellers it is of course difficult to form any very close estimate. The wealthier, we may assume, spend from $2,000 to $5,0I, but the majority oonsiderably less If we set down the, whole of the departures above stated at an average of $l,00O each, 'e shall arrive at a tolerably close approximation tothe reality. The aggregate amount, therefore, taken abroad by travellers during the last five months, may be estimated. in round numbers at $8,000.000. On the per con" side. we have to count an average of $70 a head brought hereduring the same period by 45,000 emigrants regiseredby the. Commissioners of Emigration, makinga total of $8,150,000 together with an average of $2,000 a head brought by 3 003' first-ass passgers by the steamers, meldng $8,000,0OO, and on the aggregate of arrival]s $9,150,000.

The specie moveanents during the past week have not been favour;able, the stock now held being nearly 800,0001. 7lelow that exhibited in the last monthly statement. The case of the Great Northern Railway Comrpany, as regards the manner in which its directors oare endeavouriDg to distribute the loss occasioned rby the frauds of Leopold Redpath, is likely to .attract great attention. A letter inserted in T7eTimes of the 20th inst. has drawn forth several other comenunications, and, as far as the facts can be gathered on both sides, they seem to stand as f ,llows :-The capital of railway companies is commonly represented by three descriptions of securities-ordinary shares, preference shares, and guaranteed shares. The stipulated dividend on the latter must be paid under all circumstances; the ,preference shares are entitled to dividend only when shere is a profit out of which it can be paid; and -the ordinary shares are entitled to dividend only -from the surplus profit which may remain after the Tpxeference shares have been met. Hitherto the -working of the Great Northern Companv had yielded enough to satisfy both preference and ordimary holders. But upon the detection of Redpath's lelinquencies it was found that he had thrown upon the company a heavy liability by the creation of lictitious stock. As the legal capital of the comMpany bad already reached its fixed total, how was 'This liability to be met? If from future profits, all .dividends must be suspended. This would have -created a vast amount of individual embarrassment -and would have been obviously objectionable. It was therefore resolved to make an application to 'Parliament to allow the sum to be represented by a mominal increawe of the capital of the company. 'Thus the receipts of the existing shareholders would 'be lessened for the future, since the amount of stock 'over which the profits would have to be distributed -would be so much greater, but they would avoid the 1ernporary inconvenience of a total deprivation of -dheir sources of income. The directors, conscious of the culpability on their own part which had ren- 'dered Redpath's career possible, were, of course, -extremely anxious to promote any proceeding that would best smooth over the difficnlty. They therefore pushed forward the requisite Bill, and, in -order to secure unanimity, gave the preference ashareholders to understand that there should be no -nttempt to throwr upon them any portion of the loss. SI'he propriety of this was plain, because, if the -annual defalcations of Redpath had been deducted from profits year by year as they occurred, the preferenlce shareholders wrould not have suffered, since therewould have been sufticienttopaythem, although itttle might have been left for the ordinary shareholders. Everything consequently appeared to have been eatisfactorily arranged, but a storm has now been .raised by the announcement that the Bill introduced by the directors, and which has already passed the :House of Commons, proposes, in violation of the ipledge given, to make the preference shareholders the principal victims. The affair seems to have been covertly managed, and if the allegations in the following letters are accurate it wil be likely to increase any unfavourable estimate the public may &iave already formed from previous developments of the tone or capacity of the management. Strong petitions to the House of Lords are in course of signature, and, supposing the statement to be -correct that the consent of the preference holders to the Bill in its original form was obtained by repre';entations which have been violated, it is to be .Vresumed that even on that ground alone, apart from the general merits of the question, it will be frejected. At all events, the certainty may be entertained that it will not now be allowved to piss -without a thorough examination of its bearings, or the public being satisfied that there has been no -<riumph of bad faith. " London, June 20. " Sir,-I have jast read in your MIonsy Article of this day 3Messrs. Hsggard, Hall, and Pixley's lucid letter in reference to the Bill introduced by the Great Northern Railway Corn.pany to adjust the deficiencies caused by the forgeries of edath and, as tbo columns of The Times are alwvays open 'to those who seek redress unattainable by other means, I venture to address the f ollownng lines to you. " About four years ago I was seeking an investment for a sum of money to be placed in trust, and, on the advice of a lInend, whose profession and position justified the sapposi'ti(,n that his adviLe vvould be sound, I bought Great :N7orthern Preference Four-and'-aHalf per Cent. Stock, then .3t 107. The dividend from this investment forms a considerable portion of a limuited income. I, however, alwiays looked -npon the security as unquestionable, and the premium it e,.omnmanded in the market at least showed that the same eopinion wvas entertained by the public. The Redpath frauds 'were announced in the public papers, and in due course the 'directors of the Great Northern Railway Company issued i^heir report. The profits of the half-year, however, may /not he divided without a Bill to legalize the over-issue of -stock, and enable the directors to adjust the deficiencies caused thereby. To secure votes to authorize an applicajiontoParliament, the directors, through theirchairman, conveyed to jthe preference shareholders a distinct understand. ding that the Bill should not he prej udicial to their interests, and upon that understanding alone I, for one, scnt in the ineessary proxsy. By an amendment to the original Bill it 1S nowv proposed to nuake the preference shareholders par'ticipate in the lOSsB and, as very clearly ret forth in Messrs. 1Elaygard and CO.'s letter, in liea of acting for the benefit of 'thewr shareholders at large and the interests of the company, 'which are involved in the protection of the preference r-tock, the directors evidently wvish to benefit one class of -ahareholders in particular. The result of this is that Preference Four-and-a- Half per Cent. Stock, wvhich I bought at 107, is quoted at 100, and I am minus the half-year's divi-dead due to me. The facts speak for themselves. I leave them to the consideration of all interested, and subscribe enyseif " Your most obedient servant, " A PREFERENC.e VICTIM." " Sir,-As you bave frequently used yourpen inthe cause -cf honesty and morality, permit me to draw your attention -'o the proceedings of the directors of the (Ireat Northern 2Railway Company, who are promoting a Bill in Parliament The effect of which wlll be to throw upon the preference .stock a portion of the loss occasioned by the frauds of Ixeopold Red path, notwithstanding they stated in clause 44 .,of t eir last report, "I'he directors cannot take upon themvelves to propose or support any Bill which would throw npon the preference stock any portion of the loss in ques=ion, and thereby shake the confidence of the public in all such stock.' " On the faith of this clause a vast number of the pro;prietors of preference stock were induced to send to the -chairman of the directors their proxies, who boasted of the number at the meetiDg of proprietors hp el on the 13th of Bfarch, stating that he could thereby st.ot -sny proposition he -lisapproved of. " The preference stock in railways is principally held for Ahe benefit of widows, orphans, and others, who have .invested therein at a considerable premium on the faith of its being a stock not subject to the contingencies affecting the -ordinary shares, whereas, if the Bill now being promoted in arlalment passes into a law, it wiill be a death-blow to all reference stock, which will in future be subject to any urden the propriekors of ordinary stock (who form a conaiderablo majority) may think proper to lay on it. "A PRE;'EItELNCE S'AREHOLDERf NT TEE Juino 20. GREAT NORTHRN RAILWAY." On the opposite side of the question is the subjoined attempt to show the legal correctnes of the coure taken. It is answered, however, by the fact ,hat the injustice complained of is not that the pre-gernoe iiholdera are deomed a dindon4 when there are no pro6ts, but that the ordinary ahareholders have taken during past yeara more than they were entitled to, and now endeavour to make up for it by writing off a large loss in a lump so as to leave for the moment no profits for either:- " Sir,-The answer to Messrs. Haggard and Co.'s lettor in your City Article of to-day is a very simple one,-viz., tha: preference shares are not guaranteed shares. The former have merely a right to a dividend at certain fLxed rates prior to the ordinary shareholders receiving anything, bat if nothing is earned, or the earnings are lost, their claims are extinguished. When there is nothing to divide they can get no dividend. The guaranteed shareholders, on the contrary, must be paid nuder any circuamstances. If their dividends are not paid in oSe year they must be paid the next, and so on, their claims being camulative; and hence such shares, like debenture bunds, rank higher than peference shares, and first preferences higher than second. Whether it may not be prudent and wise for companies to pay preference shares their faU dividends in all cases is another matter, but, as a question of legal right, there canbe no doubt that all preference shares have simply a priority in taking dividends where dividends are earned and declared, and that, except where provision is expressly made to that effect in the Acts of Parliament which create them, they have no claim whatever for'arrears. The holders must be content to abide by the terms and provisions of the Act creating the shares, and cannot expect ex post facto laws to be made for their especial benefit. Your obedient servant, "A A CITY MAN." "City, June 20." The promoters of the Tsthmus of Suez Canal Cormpany held a meeting to-day at the London Tavern, Sir James Duke presiding, when the following resolution was agreed to:- " That the propoced ship canal across the Isthmus of Suez baving been declared practicable by competent engineers, and all nations being invited to join in the undertaking, which will not be placed under the exclusive protection of any individual Government, this meeting, being perfectly satisfied with the explanations given by H. de Lesseps, considers its success will prove eminently advantageous to the commercial interests of Great Britain." At a meeting of the South Australian Land Company held to-day, Mr. E. Divett in the chair, a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum was declared, and the report and accomnts were unanimously adopted. The annexed abstract exhibits the progress of operations:- 'ln presenting the report for the past year the directors have to state that an improvement has taken place, as appears by the accounts now presented, which embrace the transactions of the colony up to the 31st of October, 1856, and in London to the 30th of April last. The colony has been recovering from the commercial depression caused by the overtrading in 1854.55, and, though it haa not made the rapid advance which has beea witnessed in the neighbourinR colony of Victoria, it has manifested during the year 1856 that the elements of prosperity arebeing gradually developed. The exports of the staple products of wool, ores, and breadstuffs have been largely increased. The usual estimate of the value of the property was taken on the 31st of October last. In doing this the colonial manager did not make any material alteration in the previous valuation of 1855. The total, according to the inventories received, amounts in the aggregate to 432,2951., being 6,1991. over that of the preceding year. This is in a great measure accounted for by the purchases of laud during theyear, hereafter alluded to. The followmig is a summary of the valuations received, viz :-Town lands and buildings, 73,0001,; country landsand buildings, 23.5,9251.; port lands and buildings, 32,6331,. mineral lands, 34,8801.; wharfs and warehouses, 48,1851.,; Xanmantoo mine stores, steam dredge and pile-driver, cattle and horses, goods in store, and sndry property, 7,6711.; making an aggregate of 432,2951. From the accounts presented, exhibiting a net income for the past year of 26,6071., the directors feel justified in recommending that a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum be now declared on the capital of the company, which, after payment of the interest on the debentLre bonds, amounting to 9671., will leave a balance of 7891. to be carried to next year's account." At a meeting of the African Steam Company this afternoon the report, an abstract of which was published in TUe Times of the 19th, was agreed to. The general discussion was in relation to the existing unfavourable position of affairs, and it was iatimated that a further appeal will be made to the Government to amend the charter. If this application shall not prove successful the shareholders will be called together to consider the question of a dissolution. Accounts from Oporto state that the grape disease is again making severe ravages.

The heat has been excessive at times, but there have been intervals of intense cold. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day the examination of the directors of the Royal British Bank was adjourned to the 23d of September, their balancesheet to be filed on the 1st of September. Sufficient assets are in hand to make a further dividend of Is. in the pound; but, having regard to expense, no dividend will be declared until further amounts shall have been realized. The assets are still computed to produce sufflicient to pay 10s. in the pound.

MELAWOHOLY OCCUIMPNCE AT ALw%;v--The coroner for North Northumberland held an inquest at Ain. wick on Tuesday upon the bodies of Ralph Shepherd, aged 25, and Francis Russell, aged 21, who were drowned in tho river An, opposite to the Castle, on Sunday morning, under very melancholy circumstances. It appears that thsy had gone iato a field known as the Pastures, and had striitped to bathe iti a dam. Some repairs bad been made, which c mused thhe water to be considerably deeper. Into this part of the river they had plunged with a companion named Ge=re Adamson. The river being deeper than they had calc ated, Russell wam soon seen to be.inking, whenShep. herd made to bis assistance, cryiDg out that he could not see his compalion perish. Blt he was soon in the ame fearfal extrtamity. The cries of Adamson soon brought help, and the Hon. and Rev. 9. W. Bourke, one of the curates of St. Michael's, rashed Into the water, but too late ; both poor fellows were drowned. The dam was let off and their bodies were recovered during the day. Sheepherd was about to be narried and Ruell has let a widowed mother, whose supqort hew
TRE PUBLITO HEALTH. I ~~~.Iw (From the Registror-General's Weskly Return.) The deaths regiutered in London, which lin the previous week were 934, in the week that enied on Saturday (Iune 20th) were 937. In the 10 years 1847.56 the average nuaber -of deLths in the weeks corresponding with laut week Was 966. Bat 0s tho deaths of last week occurred in an in,creased population, the average, for the purpose of com. parison, should be raised in proportion to the inerease, ia ,Which case it will become 1,063. Hence It appears that the 4eatlA now retarned were less by 76 than woould have oc. oxgred if the average rate of mortality had prevaiUd, The births registered last week exhibit an exceas of 540 over the deaths returned in the same period. The deaths referred to the zymotic class of diseases were in the previous week 161; last week they were 197. The incree arises chiefly from diarrhcea, which in the last foar weeks was fatal in 17, 26, 20, and 35 cases. Two-thirds of the 35 cases occurred to infants. No death is recorded in the week as caused by "iEnglish cholera," or auy other description of the disease. Two chUldren, aged sinx ad seven months, died of chicken-pox in lIlingtou. Two case of small-pox were fatal-one in Poplar and one in Maryle. bonoe Both measles and dlarrhcoa numbered moro deaths in the East districts than in the other parts of the metro. polis, the former complaint appeariag to be chiefly in the Shoredithh district, in Bethnal.grean, and Limehons. Hooping cough is now slightly on the declino; 41 children (a smaller number than has been obtained for a long period) deed of it last week. The illness of a child who died of meaes and typhoid fever was supposed by its father to have been caused by eating somo pork in an unsound stateFour children died of syphilitic disease; one person of ischuria, one of diabetes, one of elephantiads. Three per. vonu were the victims of intemperance, besides four whose deaths are assigned to delirium tremens. Five nonagomaraams died in tho week. all, with one exception, women and widows. Oae was 92 years of age, one 94, one 95, and two had attained the age ef 96. Last week the births of 764 boys and 763 girls, in all. 1,527 children, were registered in Lonion. In the 10 corresponding weeks of the years 1817-56 the average number was 1,465. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29 '882 in. The mean reading of Thursday was 30-015 in. The highest reading was 30 09 in. at the beginning of the week. The mean temperature of the week was 60.S, which is 1° above the average of the same week in 43 years, as determined by Mr. OSaisher. The highest reading of the thermometer in the shade was 84° on Saturday, and the mean temperature of the same day was 691°, which is 9'S' above the average. Tho lowest reading was 3S8° on Sunday (the 14th), and the range of the woek was 45-2'. The highest reading of a thermometer In the sun was obtained on Friday, and was 106I. The mean dew-point temperature was 51-2°, and tho differenoe betwoen this and the mean air temperature was 9 1.. The mean temperature of the water of the Thames was 621'. The temperature of the river rose to 647' on Satarday. The wind, which was in the south-east and east on Sanday and Monday, changed to north-east, and continued in that direction till Friday at noon, afser which it blew from the east. The amount of rain in the, week-was O85in., allof whichfellonSaturday.

FRivowtrS miD VEXATIOus ElECroo PxITIONs. -The abuse of the privilege of presenting election petitions for factious and improper purposes, without any bond 4flintention of prosecutinig them before a committee of the House of Commons, has often been complained of. Mir. Adderley and Mr. Smith Child the members for North Staffordshire (against whom a pettion was lately presented and subsequeritly withdrawn), have attempted to p t a step to this practice by initrodlucing a Bill "for regulating t he presentation and withdrawal of election petitiors." It requires, before the presentation of any (election) petitioa to the House, the persons subscribing the same, and also the agent for conduceting the petition (if any there be), to makLe a written affidaivit, to the satisfaction of the Examiner of ecognizances,to the effect that the deponrents verily believe tghe algations containedl in the petition to be well founded on fact, that the deponents are prepared to prove the samne by competent testimony, and that the petition is presented bond fide, and with fll intention to prosecute the same, and not for any improper purpoe. The power given by the existing law to petitioners summarily to withdraw election petitions on merely giving notice to the Speaker and the sitting member or his agent is withdawn, and petitioners will henceforth be required to petition the House for leave to withdraw election petitions. Such titions for leave to withdraw the original petitions il be referred to the Examiner of Recognizances, who will inquire into the matter and report the result to the House. The examiner is to have the same powers as in inquiries into recognizances. No petition for leave to withdraw a petition can be received by the House without an affidavit to tte effect that circumstances have since come to the knowledge of the petitioner which make it improbable that the originpl petition could be prosecuted with any chance of succes WTART oF ATELTIC SPORTS Ih AxMRnnc.-When some much-tormented victim of spiritual afflictions asked Martin Luther what prophylactic was likely to prove most effectual againsb the assaults of the devil, the great-hearted Reformer answered him that he knew no better assurance agapnct the inroads of the Evil One than a capital supper and a bottle of good Rhine wine. In the sound good sense of this celebrated reply lurks a complete system of practical morality worthy the grave attention of aulpeople, and particularlyof the "universal Yankee nation." The unbalanced despotism of the inteUect is the sorest social cmse under which we labour in the United States. Sports of all kdnds, and especially the hearty athletic sports which develope the body with the brain, and bring forward the sharp, qtuicl-, active qualities of what may be called the " physical" mind in an equal degree with the subtler facalties of ratiocination, have never beenencouragedasong usas theyshouldhave been. Oar mureularnature rarely gets a fair chanco in our life. We exist by and for the nerves, and it is no fancifal theory which attributes the sudden exoesses and equally sudden relapses of political feeling, the partisan intolerance, and the coquetish impatience of our public life in no small degree to the want among usof national games and astimes, mainly joyous and earnest. We are continually tod that the European races are degenerating physically on this continent, and no longer ago than last summer an elaboratepaper was read before the Biitish Association at Cheltenham, in England, to prove that at no distant dato the Anglo-American and HispanoAmerican races in the New World must utterly disappa by their own defaualt, and give placw, in a11 huma probability, to a mighty republic of Dig-tailed Chinamen I The paper was written seriouRsy and seriously discussed, and not a few facts. of somewhat portentous sinificance were adduoed to support its poition. Absurd as such notions are, there is very good reason,hor ever, for believing that the staudard of physi al vigour in the oldler regions of this country is by no means equa to that standard as it exists in the newer States of thLe Far West, or the more genil= nations of Euro Whethe averae wealth fthe individual inewYorfor instanQe, exceed &considerably the average wealth of the individala in London, the average length of humn ilire, which is the only tolerably safe test that can be applied to determine the sanitary condition of a people, is decidedly greater in London than in New York. That is, the averape citizen of the American metropolis, with more ample means of subsistence at his oommand, enjoys leas of the priceless boon of heetth thanthe average citizen of the British capital. It is easily possible, of course, to find a hundred plausible suppositions which may serve to account for this surprising and very unsatisfactory truth. Bat there can beno reasonsble doubt that one very prominent and efficient cause of this difference between ourselves and our Transatlantic kinsmenin respect of physical development is to be found inthe greater prevalence throughout England of a taste for all manner of manly and athletic exercises. While the coarser and more brutal amnsements of bull and bear baiting, or of dog and cock-fighting, have gradually disappeared beforo the advancing spirit of the age (since the death of the leta Lord Sefton, the present chief of the Tory Churchmen, the Earl of Derby, is, we believe, the only respectable representative left in England of the anstocratic patrons of tho cockpit), the cordialand Invigoratng sports of the field and the sea-bunting, aicket salton, fishing, and yachting-hare been as teadily onthe increase.

LO)?DON, THURSDAY, JUNE 25, X57. The House of Commons yesterday resolved itselr into a committee upon the remaining clauses of the JudgmenW tExecution, &c., Bill. After a debate of a very discursive charaeter, 'which lasted upwards of four hours, and related priicipally to the question what should be done with the Bill -whether it should be taken up bythe Gove3nment, or committed pIo form4 and aftervards recommitted, or postponed until next session, or, lastly, as the opposition came almost entirely froti Irish members, whether Ireland should not be excluded from the Bill,-a motion that tlh Chairman report progress, upon which divisions had been repeatedly taken, was at length agreed to, only two clauses of the Bill having been pasaed1.. The OAiRNxAw had leave to sit again on Wednesday next. The House then went into committee upon the Scientific and Literary Societies Bill, butbefore the second clause could be disposed of the time for discussion had expired. A report of the committee upon Mr. NnwAL's petition in relation to the Rochdale election was brought up by Mr. EINEY and read in extnso. The House adjourned at 6 o'clock.
Not since the Imperial Crown of France was placed on the head of NAPoLEox III. by the vote of 1852 has any political eventunconnectedwithforeiga affairs so roused the attention of the world as the elections which have just taken place. The results are now sufficiently known. InParis the Govermnent hasbeendefeated inthree districtsoutof ten. General CAVAIONAC, formerly Chief of the Republic and the opponent of the present EMiPEROR in the contest for the Presidency, has been chosen iL the third district, though, on account of the insufficiency of his majority, he must go through another election. In the fifth and sixth districts MM. CAnNOT and GouVD cnAUx, names well known in former days, have been returned by large majorities. It is true that in the other seven districts Government candidates have been returned, yet we cannot but look upon the result of the elections in Paris as a moral blow to the Government. At Lille, Bordeaux, and Lyons it is also said that Opposition candidates have triumphed. The struggle, therefore, is not unlike that which seated Louis NAPOLEON, nearly nine years ago, in the Presidential chair. Then, as now, the great mass of the people supported him through confidence in his personal qualities and veneration for his family name. But Paris, Lille, Lyons, and some other centres of population and disaffection protested, perhaps, even more strongly ths n than now. It appears that in the present case the number of Opposition candidates returned is very smallthe Ministerial papers say there are not more than nine or ten; so that the EMPERop may well assert that' the great body of the people which chose him is still ready to support the legislators of his choice. So far, then, the Government has been successful, and no one could doubt its success. But it is not at all improbable that from the elections of 1857 may be reckoned a period very different from that with which the Empire commenced. Undoubtedly, the policy of the Empire is, and always has been, to appeal from Paris to France, from the fickle, critical, and keen-witted inhabitants of the capital, to the more domestic, affectionate, religious, and money-saving provincials. No one can doubt the determination of the EhrPRoR not to be dictated to by mobs or meetings as long as he possesses the steady adherence of those whose votes placed him on the throne. Yet an adverse election in Paris must exercise much influence both at home and abroad. In the first place, Paris is not only to Frenchmen but to the world in general the representative of France. English travellers who visited the country prior to thefiratlRevolution observedthe complete dependence of mind which distinguished the people of the provinces, and the character is still the same. The very farmers and vine-growers who supported Government candidates this week will begin to doubt their own wisdom when they hear that a CAVAGNAc and a CAMNOT have been returned by a district of enlightened and witty Parisians. Furthermore, Paris and the large towns are the only places, or are thought to be the only places, where electors are not intimidated and ballot-boxes are not tampered with. In the rural diztricts the Prefect and the Bishop, the Maie and the Priest, may be said to constitute society. The peasantry and small proprietors, acute and hard-fisted enough in their way, are the most acquiescent of mortals, so far as regards dynasties and constitutions. They will follow the lead of Government officers and spiritual advisers, and their votes may always be counted on for the support of existing authority, excepting when, as in the ease of the Presidency of 1848, the clergy are ranged against the civil power. It is likely, then, that both to France and the world the elections of Paris, Lyons, and Lille may stand for the legitimate expresson of the country's will. There there is communication and co-operation; the votes, though given by ballot, are no secret, and the opinions of each elector are known to a large body of friends. So they may be considered free, and the result of a more instructed choice than the decision of any body of provincials. The conduct of the Government officials must also add to any distrust with which the course of this conflict has been regarded. It is now plain to the world that the Emrrron and his advisers set their hearts on returning every man of their own party. Paris was especially the object of their solicitude; so eager were the Tuileries and the Hotel de Ville that even in this most solemn constitutional procedure, in this first essayof the rights guaranteed by thLe Imperial system, the most intolerable interference was practised. Nor was it successful. Men who live under despotic power become disposed to respect courage and unshaken self-confidence above any other qualities of a ruler ; and in this affair such acts as the warning of the SiUde, the publication of M. HAUSSMASS intemperate address, and the undignified mauifesto of M. BIJLAuLT may well have prevented thousands from voting for the Government candidates, and swelled the lists which gave the Opposition candidates a seat in the Legislature. Now, however, we must look to the future. The new Legislative Body is chosen. It is, as before, devoted to the Government, but has among its number a knot of men who, under the various names of Constitutionalist, Liberal, and Republican, are hostile to the system which is now established in France. The question is,-" What "4 will these new Representatives do ? " The Minister of the Interior has declared that they are merely frondears who have sought election under the present Constitution in order that they may publicly express their contempt for it, and refuse their allegiance to the Throne. A great body of Frenclumen, and probably thousands who voted for the Opposition candidates, think so too. We cannot doubt that many a workman who has smelt the powder of the barricades, and whose friend or brother has disappeared either to the grave or to Guiana, after some insurrectionary movement, voted in the hope that the candidate of his choice would indignantly refuse the oath to obey the usurper, and quit the Chamber, exclaiming " Vive Za BepubiMe PI Bat we cannot think that the Opposition members will be so ill-advised as thus to play the game of the Government, and acquire for themselves the reputation of factious and theatrical disturbers of the peace. Even if they do not recognize thelegality of the means by which the Earrxaon mounted his throne, yet he is on it, and a majority of the nation has not only condoned but approved the excesses of 1851. N.APoLEoN IrI. is Emperor of the French; the elections have taken place under the Imperial Constitution, and to accept the part of a candidate is to accept the Government which authorized the election. For the few Liberals who have been returned to quit the Chamber with an affiected protest against the r6oime which alone allowed them to enter it would be a display highly detrimental to their cause. It would justify all that the Government organs have said respecting the vanity and intemperance of the Opposition, and would furthermore be a betrayal of those who have endangered their prospects in order to restore to the contitution an element of vitality. We have said that possibly these elections will be the beginning of a new period. This may be so, if the Liberal candidates whose claims have been supported by the people go into the Chamber with a determination to play the part of honest and independent legislators. Without speeches treasonable or seditious, without protests against the misdeeds of past days, they may effectually, if they desire, check the self-will of the Court and the insolence of its functionaries. Even a dozen men, if they hold together, and make moderate and well-timed speeches about matters on which they are sure to be right, must in a few months exercise a moral control over any number of benches filled with the puppets of a Government. The small end of the wedge has been forced into the fabric of the Imperial system; whether it will be driven home depends on the judgment of the men to whom the Opposition has confided its cause.
We may not be in the secret. Education may be an exception to all general rules. We may borrow our notions too much from the vulgar traffic of gross material things. If it be so, of course we shall be told; and in that case no haxr wil be done. Yet we cannot help perusing with an interest verging on amusement the various devices with which some score of very clever and excellent gentlemen, divines, philosophers, politicians, inspectors, commissioners, and the like, propose to bribe, or compel, or entrap the working people of this country into giving their children the proper quantum of schooling. One is reminded, most involuntarily, of the artifices employed Dto prQcure a sale for hats. There is Mr. 4mim, the New York hatmaker, who for this purpose gave $5OO for seat No. 1 to hear JExry IaND. There is the man who carted about a hat as big as a small house, with his name and address upon it. The like object has been attempted by a procession of twenty hats,. all repeating with striking fidelity the important n,'me, street, and number. Others have tried a gratuitous distribution of hats; others a quarrel with rival hatmakers; others have invoked the muse; others have gone on the liberal tack, and filed their shopwindows with the hats of all nations-square, round, high, low, cylindrical, conical, broad-brimmed, narrow-brimmed, black, white, and brown. There is the hat under a shower-bath, or inverted in a tub of water. There are hats of preposterous cheapness, and others have nothing to recommend them but their gentlemanly price. It has long ago been pointed out that, after all, the best-way probably to get custom for hats was to make them good. Hats being much at the mercy of atmospherical changes, and being prominent objects, speedily reveal the strength of their constitution, and report infallibly on the hone3ty and skil of the maker. A shower of rain-and it is well known that a new hat always attracts rain-brings out the qualities of a hat beyond mistake; and if it covers anything better thau a block the wearer will know whether to go to the same shop again. Paszinglfrom this parable of the hat to the furniture of the skull under it, we must say that we can imagine no specific, no system, no dodge, for getting children to stay at school, and their parents to keep their children there, at all so likely to answer as making the education a good one. A good education, too, is very like a good hat. It should be not only strong, substantial, stiff, and durable, but shapely, glossy, comfortable, and, above all, a good fit. Is it possible that such hats should be unsold? Is it possible that such an education should be neglected? NTo. A good article alwayscommands a ready sale. Nothing tells sooner than education, and the proof is patent to alL No boy can bh at a good school without very soon bearing himself better; having a quieter, more manly, and more possessed manner; talking better, more collectedly, more articulately and rationally; reading better; having some matter of interest in his mind ready to overflow at his lips, and being a more conversible and more useful being. It wi soon be seen by those about him -whether he takes to reading, and remembers what he reads, aud whether he can really do the things which the school pretends to teach him-whether he can do any ordinary question in figures or write an English sentence. Hence we must ever think that the education itself is the first and highest pointof the educational controversy. On the other hand, supposing the education to be an indifferent one, or one proceeding on some conventional model, there does seem a hardship, approaching to cruelty, tyranny, sand fraud, in enticing, or cajoling, or bullying people into keeping their children at school longer than they wish to do. No doubt, the people who have read papers and taken part in the discussions at WILIs' Rooms and the Thatched-house Tavern are men of sense and energy, in whose own hands a school is sure to prosper. But this invariable prosperity does not characterize the schools of every system; and there are systems stupid enough almost to countervail the efforts of the best masters. When this is at all generally the case, and when we have a strong conviction that the education given by numerous and wealthy societies is one proper enough, perhaps, for children up to nine or ten, but not for older scholars, much less for the age of fourteen or fifteen, then we feel a great repugnance to the application of a pressure from withoutto bribes, laws, confident promises, or any strong persuasion. We should hesitate to use the legislation of the Factory Acts simply for the detention of children at any given school; and we are not surpriaed to find the Eense of the Conference, particularly of the Inspectors, against compulsion. We should be sorry to see children kept wholly from the ordinary occupations about them in the very vague hope of acquiring powers suited to positions they may never attain to. Employers, great and small, and the State among them, will always go into the market for labour, and give the most money to the be3t man. They will never employ a mechanic, an artisan, a shopman, or a foreman one bit the more for having a certificate of attendance so many years at some unknown, or even some known, school. They wiU trust more to a week's trial than to five years' dead reckoning of attendances and examinations. Even if the great capitalists should accept the diplomas of the Society of Arts, of the Unive;sities, of Education Committees, Inspectors, Colleges of Schoolmasters, and all that is, or is to be, they would be speedily beaten by the light unfettered race of commercial adventurers -who with no capital at all are looking out for the newest machines, the newest patterns, the nowest and beat men. The small people would soon beat the great people if the latter ran with clogs and fettera, and I the former without those heavy decorations. So this is a matter, not of choice, but of necessity, with ! the great people, and with Government also. When, however, tne alternative is not employment, but idleness, and when the boy who doei not go to school, or his parent, who does not senad him, begs, or steals, or applies for parish relief, j then, of course, we have every right to take the Xboy and send him to the first school as the [ condition of relief. Some of the papers read insisted on the nec6ssity of industrial training, especially with a view to the probable occupations of the scholars. Other paperS referred to the continental systems, partioularly to the greater classification used there than in our ordinary schools, in the greater number of schools, classes, and masters. There can be no question as to the importance of these things. A boy at the age of ten can, and therefore ought, to receive some sort of fitting for his probable work. This is easy enough, as different kinds of work predominate in different localities. In one all are engineers, mechanics, carpenters, workers in metals, painters, and so forth. In another employment converges in the building of houses or of ships. Shopkeeping, is the work of another region. MIining, weaving, spinning, lacemaking, pottery, hardware, all and each have their special arts and sciences, in which even a boy of ten can be more advanced than another, and worth more money. Indeed, nothing shows itself so soon as handiness, cleverness, quickness of invention, and variety of resources ; and, though sohool will not give these qualities, it may bring them out. Then, as for the classification of our ordinary schools, it certainly does strike us as their weakest point. When two hundred boys from seven to fifteen are in one room, when eight or ten classes are all answering questions at the same time; where there is one master for all, assisted only by pupil teachers who havenever emergedoutof the school atmosphere, and have been teaching or taught the same things all their lives, the only result, however astonishing and pleasing, will be an infant school grown to undue and monstrous proportions. Inthese schools we feel assured that minds which have developed very fairly till nine or ten will be very apt to come then to a stand, and slhow no real progress. The scholars may answer the same questions more promptly; they may fill up the skeleton map or the skeleton history with more rivers and cities, more dates and names; they may have advanced a " rule ;" they may spell some harder words, do a long sum quicker, and, in fact, be at fourteen what the cleverest of their age were at nine; but we feel too sure that the precocity of these schools will be that of childhood, and that boys will be apt to lose their time, and even settle into a contented inferiority, by staying much longer. Where it is po2sible, then, boys ought to be advanced to new rooms, to new masters, to new books and subjects. They ought to have the law and duty of progress impressed upon them by surrounding circumstances, by. the nature of their studies, and the faces of their schoolfellows. Mark progress and you may make it. In this way the children and their parents may be made to feel that a year's school is a year's gain, and may have good reason to weigh the comparative advantages of staying that year longer or going to the factory. Who that enters even a good ordinary school, National, British, or what not, as things now are, can say that the difference of a year more or less is so very marked, and so likely to strike the mind of the parent to whom half-a-crown a-week is an object? It is not our place to describe this progressive instruction, or to arrange the studies, the books, of the successive classes. When we see such a course on paper, we may have an opinion upon it; but we can only say we have not yet seen one likely to answer the purpose.
The discussions on the great question of our Cotton Supply, if they have brought one or two points of the case more decidedly into controversy than before, have placed others beyond any reasonable doubt. There can be no uncertainty about the reality or urgency of the crisis itself. True it is, that through what has now been a long series of years we have invariably found supplies forthcoming from the United States without any of those interruptions which might be theoretically conceivea. True it is, also, that notwithstanding the astonishing increase of the demand, the supply has hitherto kept pace with it, and our manufacturers have, as a matter of fact, been pretty well provided with the raw material wb;ch they required. But it is also true that to make both ends meet is gradually growing more and more a matter of difficulty, that scarcity is felt even now, and that the Americans themselves have expressed apprehensions as to their continued powers of production at the rate of increase prevailing. Another point established is, that India can undoubtedly supply all the cotton which our increased consumption may render necessary, and of any quality desirable. Mr. J. B. Saaxn, who opened the debate on Tuesday, related an instance in which Indian-grown co-ton had been soldin Manchester at 6id. per lb., the ordinary value of native produce being 3jd., and Mr. TuNPRn, who followed him, added the weight of his personal au.hority in confirmation of the g, neral proposition. The cotton of India, in its original character, though not so good as might be produced by skilful proceedings, is by no means of a bad staple, its principal blemishes being caused by removable drawbacks attending its picking and carriage. As to the capacity of the country for production there were not two opinions. Mr. MAxoGrxs himselfthe representative of the East India Companysaid, that under certain conditions India " could supply all the cotton that this country "would require;" in facL, that there was " hardly " any amount" which our manufacturers might not obtain from that source if they were to set about the work in a proper manner. This being the case, and it being admitted both that it is highly expedient to provide for a demand so rapidly on the increase, and that India, from the circumstances of its teiritory and population, offers the best means of effecting the provision, why is a result thus shown to be both desirable and practicable not brought to paqs, or, at any rate, put into promising traini? Here lies the critical point of the case. Why does not Ind:a export more cotton, and how can it be enabled ts do so ? We need not include in the argument the calls of the home consumption. No doubt, the Hindoos absorb a large portion of the cotton crop themselves, though it is by no means sure, as Lord STANIXY suggested, that they might not be clad more cheaply with English calicoes, even after all the cost of carriage backwards and forwards. But this consideration is of no moment whatever, for it is perfectly certain that the capabilities of the country in this respect are boundles-indeed, in a single province of Bombay there is uncultivated land of extent and quality sufficient to yield millions of bales every season. Why, then, are such crops not reared? There was some firce in the argument of Mr. )AhNGLEs, that the rcquisition for Indian cotton was rather a casualty than a certainty, and that a permanent supply could hardly be expected where there was no permanency in the demand. If the function assigned to India in cotton-growiDg is merely to fill up a possible gap, it is not likely that the producticn of the article wouald be pushed with much vigour. But here it must be remarked that, according to otur present prospects, the question seems no longer eonfined to the insurance of a given supply. Looking at the probable demand for our manufactures, there would scarcely be any limits to ourwant of raw material, and, if millions after millions are to be clothed from our looms, market after market must be opened to us for cotton. Admitting that the Americans may command the first purchasers, there wil be plenty more for the Hindoos if the quality, of the produce is but satisfactory. If, then, this quality is attainable, why is not the problem solved, and the longdesired traffic established ? I Taking the objections on one side and the anBwera on the other, the expoistulations of the Manchester opinners and, the replies of the Tndian authorities, we find the gist of the whole case to be aomewhat as follows :-The production of cotton on a large and efficient scale requires-like all such enterprises-a greater investment of capital and energy than are at the command of the Hindoo. It is not simply money which is wanted, but vigour. If Manchester agents would go out with full purses and European ideas, the country is broad enough and populous enough to furnish all that is required besides. So argued Mr. MANGLES, and with perfect reason, as far as the mere facts went. The tables, however, appear turned upon the Company when we come to inquire why Englishmen do not embark in this as they would in any other speculationof promise, forwe are thentold that theAdministration of India is such that no man accustomed to free government will live under it. Excluding the great capitals of the Presidencies, there are actually only 317 British subjects in India independent of the Company's service. This service represents a caste as complete and as privileged as that of the Brahmins themselves, and Englishmen are naturally not much disposed to be treated as outsiders. Bat can this be effectually remedied ? It cannot be forgotten that the Government of India, though doubtless bound to consult the requirements of British markets, is also charged with the ad. ministration of an enormous empire, and that, even if half the population of England were to migrate to the Deccan, their numbers would be lost in the native millions around them. These millions, too, are so touchy and sensitive on particular points of faith or custom that the most harmless proceeding, as we have recently seen$ may be interpreted into an alarming grievance. Fairly enough may it be argued that the institutions of such a country are not to ba easily adapted to English notions of freedom. Whether the tentue of the land offers any real obstacle to agricultural activity over and above those arising from the traditional ideas of the population it may not be easy to say, but there was certainly one point on which all parties were more or less agreed. Mr. M&cGL.s acknowledged that " roads"' had something to do with the price of cotton, and Mfr. TuRnx described the damage which the material suffered in its conveyance to the coast. Dr. BuST, as our readers will this morning observe, goes more directly to the pointj, and comprehensively asserts that " were the -valley "of Berar connected with Bombay by railway, "Liverpool could get all the cotton she wants for "21d. a-pound, all land and sea charges included." Now, this point, at any rate, need involve little controversy. There may be a question between English and American systems of construction; but it is clear that facility of transport is the great thing needed. " At the rates which now exisbed u upon the Madras Railway," said Mr. MAsGLEs, one pound of cotton might be conveyed 450 "miles for 3-5ths of a farthing," and he thought the fact ought to satisfy the Lancashire remonstrants. No doubt it does so, but over how many miles can cotton thus be carried ? At the same time, although there can be no disg-uie about the obligations of the Indian Government in this respect, we think the authorities or the Company may fairly ask for some issue rather more definite than has yet been raised. What is it, specificaly, that they are required to do ? Mr. MAYeGaxS detected the weak point in the Manchester case when he recommended his opponents to put their own shoulders to the wheel, instead of calling upon the Company. Certainly we have no wish to see an artificial cultivation established in India by any system of bounties or protection agaiunst the natural laws of trade. If a supply of cotton cannot be created by the fair operation of demand, it can never be sucesesftlly maint ained by Govelrment intervention. The authorities, however, may remove obstacles, and this species of aid is all the more indispensable in India, where nothing can be done without Government concurrence. They can, at least, promote cultivation by public works; they can hasten the execution of railways, and they can tal,e care that no impediment shall be found between a fair field for the husbandman at one end and an accessible port for shipment at the other. After these conditions have been satisfied-and they ought not to be very embarrassing-tc3 manufacturers of Lancashire must do the rest for themselves.

M1JRDEB D SuiCImE.-On Tuesday evening, the 23d, a most melancholy suicide and murder was commUited at Wallingford. A woman named Corner, wife of one of the. country postmen, was seen to take her three children (the eldest a boy of about eight and the other two much younger) towards tho bridge, as if going for a walk, at about 9 o'clock. As she did not return all night, an alarm was raised, and after searching the river for some time the bodies of the th-ee children werediscovered cold and dead. After a further search the body of the mother was found, also dead. The bodies were removed to the Town Arms, there to awai i the coroner's inquest. Mrs. Corner was a 7nost respectable anid industrious woman, much respected by aU who knew her, and the shocking event has cut sa gloom over the whole town, which is seldom disturbed by anything so fearful as this sad occurrence. EsARTum.-In the report of the annversary mesting of the Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire in Thc IVmas of Tuesday it awas stated that smce the formnatton of the society 4,010 lives had beeh saved, by their officers.

I 17NIVERSITY-INTELLIGINGL?. nvvn,R,n -,V- IA omm vnAviMfn hirrn7z- A briliant sua and a cloudle. sky wshered in ts dosig day o£ the Oxford annual festivities. Notwithstuding tVe lte hour (4 0olock) to which the bl given by. th Frw masons in the Town-hall had beeon prolonged the skeets between 9and 10 am. were thronged witherowds spi of lady visitors, wending their way towards th 1se Theatre, the scene of the ceremonies which give to the Oxford festival season its well-known title ofi The Com. inemoration" Very shortly after 10 o'clock every seat in the ladies' circle was taken ; the semicircle was already haf occupiod, the undergraduates' gallery crowded, and the are about half filled with strangers, Bachelors, and Masters of Arts. Tho usual seriesof shouti and cries werocommenced, and were carried on with vigour for fuly an hour before the prooession appeared. The absence of any peculiarly loud voice, .possessiog a natural right to command attention and diect the proceedings of the Undergraduate body on th3 occasion, produced a degree of confusion not ordinarily witnessed, and while baffling utterly, except at rare intervals, the coomprehensiou of the great body of the auditors, rendered it extremely doubtful whetber those who swelled thg volume of sound knew themselves exactly for what they were shouting. Amid the hubbub wedicerned-orthought we discerned-the following results. The cries were rrely politieal,-tbe names of Lord Derby, Mr. Glad. Atone, and Lord Clarendon were received with favour. The names oEf .almerston and Russell attracted little notce. The Bishop of Oxford was cheered, as were the Bishops of Kentucky and Victoria. Three vigorous rounds of applause were given to hiss Nightingale. The Vice-Chanoellor and the Senior Proctor were loudly cheered, whilo a storm of groans greeted the name of the Junior Proctor, which was however met and ultimately overpowered by friendly plaudits Mi. Freeman, one of the Modern HistoryExaminers, and "thesenior member of the University who tried to stop the ball," were also the objects of some disapprobation. The Dean of Christ Church, the Hector of Exeter, and the Mater of Balliol were cheered; the name of the &faster of Pembroke was greeted with mingled cheers and hisses. Mrs. Liddell, on tkng her seat in the semicirde, wasvery warmly applauded. "The ladies" received the usual amount of polite attention, the chief variations of the captivating theme which met our ears being "the ladies in white," "the ladies in blue," "the ladies in pink," "the ladies in love," "the young ladies," " the old ladies," " the ladies with hoods to their loaks," "the ladies with no hoods to their cloa,"&. "Cambridge University" was very warmly cheered, and the "University of Sidney"'wasnot forgotton;"Caddesdon" also had a number of energetic supporters The favourite amusements of the place had likewise their turn- "the Oxford Eleven," " the Cambridge Eight," " the Brasenose Eight," the "Oriel Eight," were given one after another, and roceived with more orlessof favour. At interals, throughout the whole courseofthe proceedings a stormof diapprobationt raged through the upper gallery, provoked' invarably by some innocent and unsuspecting person, who having stepped inside the doors of the building had forgotten to remove his bat. The gallantry of the Undergraduates appeared quito unable to endure this insult to the ladies present, and an ever fresh burst of discatisfaction greeted those who in this way trantgressed the laws of academical politeness. At a few minutes past 11 o'clock the arest gates of the theatre were tbrown open and the head of the procession appeared. It consisted of the Vice-Chancellor, the Proctors, the Heads of most of the CoUeges and Halls (with the exception ofthe Dean of Christ Church' who was absent), Dr. Jacobson, Dr. Dasent, Dr. Tristram, &c., Lord 8kelmersdale, the Bishop of RuperVs Land, the Bishop or Victoria. The VIc-CxCAPcrLLor, having taken his eat amid loud cheering, opened the proceedings by the ordi. nary LAtin speech being interrupted occaionally by ap. plause as he read the names of those on whom degrees were about to be conferred by Convocation. Dr. TwbE, the Regius Professor of Civil Law, then introduced ths several candidates for degrees in a series of short speeches remarkable for the elegance of their Latinity. MajorGeneral Sir Colin Campbell and Sir W. F. Williams of Bars, on whom degrees were conferred last year in their absence, were first presented and admitted. Loud cheers greeted the name of the gallant highlander, but the strength of the Undergraduates' lungs was evidently kept back for the Hero of kars, who was received with a prolonged and deafening roar of applause only equalled, in our memory, by that which uxed of old to greet the Great Captain when he appeared before the Academic body. Hats, caps, and handkerchiefs were waved, the area catching the enthusiasm of the gallery, and it was several minutes before the tumult was sufficiently subsided to allow of the proceedings being continued. The new candidates for degrees were then presented in the order given in our impression of yesterday. The Swedish Amba-sador, Baron Hochehild, was well received, though his name was evidently unfa. miliar to the aucdience. The reception of the American 'Minister was more equivocal, as if the Undergraduate body doubted the fiiendly disposition of President Buchanan, and disliked what they construed into approval of a ProSlavery Administration. Lord Powis was received somewhat coldly, Sir G. Cornewall Lewis with enthusiasm, Oxford evidently not forgetting his devotion to clasalca literature. Sir Johu n l'NeiU was varmly greeted, as was Sir Charles Nicholson, the Provost of the University of Sidney, and late Speaker of the House of Assembly. There wes nothing remarkable in Mr. Sotheron Estcourt's reception, but loud cheers greeted the two great engineers, Mr. R. Stephenson and Mr. I. K. Brunel, who were the next persons presented. The presentation of Di. Wgen was accompanied by one or two amusing incidents. The junior part of the auditory evidently questioned the propriety of Latinizing his title of " Chief Director of the Berlin Museum" by the words, " Reegii apud Borussos Musei Summus Director," and freely expressed their doubts on the subject. Scarcely had they ended their criticisms on this point when their ears were shoclked by a shtement that among Dr. Waagen's other claims were his exertion, in oonnexion with the ' nova Expositio apud Manchaster." " What I Don't you know the Latin for Manchester ?" ex claimed aclearvoice, which was heardthroughoutthe theatres and produced a roar of laughter, in which we observed the learned Professor himself join. The next person presentedw as Dr. Livingston-" vir constas et intrepidus,"whose appearance elicited a tumult of applause only second to that which had shown to the hero of Kars how the Oxford public appreciates him. Dr. FArs presentation terminated this part of the proceedings, which had occupied about three-quarters of an hour. The Public Orator (Mr. Michell) then proceeded to deliver the Crewian oration amid perpetual interruption, which he bore with invincible good. humour, forcing gradually his persecutors to relax in their efforts by his thorough bonhomie and evident resolve not to lose his temper. In condusion, the Prize compositions were reci;zd by their authors, with the exception of the Newdigate, which was read by a friend of the writerSs, as he himself was too unwell to attempt the reeitation. The Latin poem, by Mr. Bowen, Scholar of Ballol, was excellently delivered, and contained several very beautiful passages which caUed forth repeated plaudits. The Newdegate appeared also to be aplensing poem, more in the style of Keats than of Pope, and was very weU received by the auditory. Of the Essaws it is impossible to judge by a mere recitation of certain selected pasages. The proceedings were brought to a lose a.bout 1 o'clock, when the procession once more passed through the Divinity School, after which those who composed it and those who had witnessed the ceremonies dispersed to enjoy the refreshment bountifully provided in the Halls of the various Colleges. The prize founded by Lord Stanhope for the encouragement of the studies of law and modern history has been awarded to Mr. Herbert Cowell, of Wadham College.

THE PBBSIAg EXPBDITIOA. (FROM OUR OWN OMESrPOWDENT.) MOHAMhY&IRAE[, Asmr 28. MIy last to you was dated as late as the 23d, but as the Planet has been ordered up to Bagdad, not so much to take as to bring down despatehes, I may even send you a few lines to tell you that the highest ground about two miles from Mohammerah has finally been selected as the site for our camp during the hot weather. There has been no end of inquiries, examinations, surveys, &F., before this point was settled, and the result seems to give satisfaction to all concerned. Sir James, in compauy with Generals Havelock and Lugard, the Superintending-Surgeon, and others, steamed up the Karoon in the Planet on the 24th as far as Sablah, the spot which had been recommended as the most eligible place for our camp. There the party was met by the Qulartermaster-General and hlilitary Secretary, who had spent a whole day in reconnoitring the country hereabouts, and for six miles beyond ablah. Their report was uufavourable, and, according to them, not a single spot they visited was as promising as the ground in the vicinity of our present camp. The soil generally is pure clay, which, wben wet either by rain or the inuadations of the river, becomes soft, slippery mud. Sablah is beyoud the date groves, but it is close upon the Dorak canal, and the whole of the district around being very low is subject to the overflowing of the river. This does not take place, however, as it does lower down, by the influence of the tide, but by the heavy rains which fall in the interior. Several natives were coinsulted and their depositions taken, and though the Arabs seemed anxious to have our camp in their vicinity, as well for the protection which it would aflbrd them as for the hope of gain, yet they one and all are said to have testified that, as the rainy season was not yet over, it was still not unlikely tbat the country might be inundated. SirJames and his party remained on the river during the night, aud the following day visited several other sites, bult not one wvas found more promising than that occupied at present by part of our troops. The natives weere then examined as to that spot, and it appeared from their evidenee that it hbd been the camping-ground for years of the Persian troops, had been selected for the same purpose by an English force about 50 years ago was again chosen by the Persians, then by the Turks under Ali Pasha, and lastly by the Persians once more, until their late expulsion by our capture of Mohammerah. It transpired on further inquiry that Captain Selby, of the Indian Navy, had written a report some years ago, wherein he spoke of Mohammerah, or rather of the high ground behind it, as most healthy; that he had spent months of the hot weather there, and had never lost one of his crew; and, irifact, that he regarded it in the light of a sanitarium as compared with any other place in this quarter. Mr. Lynch, who has resided in this country for many years, testified to the same, so that altogether there seems every reason to believe that the best selectionhas been made, and that the troops will be as healthy here as in any station in India. At present the number of sick is remarkably small, and the men generally, barring their disappointment at not having a chance of thrashing the Persians, are as jolly as they can be. All, I believe, prefer this place to Bushire, for here they have abundance of excellent water, are free from the dust storms of the Gulf, and have shady walks to resort to under the date groves which fringe the river's banks. The site, then, having been selected, the work of erecting suitable barracks for the men has commencedi already, and will be continued writh vigour. The double-roofed tents are to be pitchedl, and a mud wall in lieu of the canvass wall is to be built up around them. The inner fly of the roof is to be covered with mats or date branches, and the floors are to be sunk from two to four feet below the ground, after the manner of Eastern serdaubs. Talties of camelthorn will be affixeC to the windows and doors, and these, when wet, will entirely neutralize the effects of the hot winds. The men, moreover, are to be provided with curtains to screen them from the plague of musquitoes which, according to native testimony, prevent sleep and frequently " make men sick." Books are to be sent np from the Presidency without delay, as wdl as rackets, skittles, &c. Theatricals are being talked of in camp, and every effort is being made to conduce to the health and cheerfulness of the force. Sir James sees into all these things himself, and the men are delighted with their truly considerate general. l..LY 9. I have not much to communicate to you since my last; nevertheless, the little which I have to write is not destitute of importance. Sir James Outram and part of his staff sailed for Bushire on the 29th ult., touching at Earrack by the way. At Bushlre he received discretionary power from the Government of India to dispense with any part of the force not required for the purposes of the occupation after the ratification of the treaty; and, accordingly, preparations were immediately set on foot for despatching the European troops to India. This done, Sir James again embarked on board the Feroze, and shortly after met the Pioneer with the despatches which had been brought from Bagdad by the Comet. These, it appears, confirmed the intelligence which had been communicated several days before, to the effect that the Shah had signed the treaty, and despatched itto Bagdad. The exchange of the ratifications was expected on the 6th inst., when Mr. Murray would lose no time in proceeding to Teheran. The official bearer of the alogies was on the road from the capital to Bagdad, and it was calculated that the mission would commence its journey about the 1st of June. At about midnight of the 6th the Feroze grounded on a sandbank to the east of the mouth of the Shattul-Arab, and the Rajah of Cochin troopship, which she had in tow, drawing less water, rau into her stern, smashing the cutter and coming with such force against the roundhouse that it fel in with one tremendous crash. Sir James, General Lugard, and the Rev. Mr. Badger were asleep inside, and it was a miracle of Providence that aU three were not crushed to death. The furniture in the room eserved to prevent the heavy roof, on which two immense hawsers were coiled, from coming in direct contact with the deck, and left just sufficient room to allow of the gentlemen being extricated without receiving much damage beyond a few bruises. Those who inspected the ruins next morning and saw where the heavy beams lay, expressed their astonishment that even one escaped instantaneous death. The Feroze received more damage by this untoward accident than by the shot of the enemy at the capture of Mohammerah. Here we are now all bustle and hard at work preparing to evacuate Mohammerah as soon as possible. Her Majesty's 78th Highlanders and the Native Light Battalion, with one troop and two companies of European artillery, are to be despatched forthwith to India, and the embarcation has commenced already. The 23d and 26th Native Infantry and a company of Madras Sappers are to go to Bushire, whence Her Majesty's 64th and the 2d Europeans will be sent-the former to Belgaum, and the latter to Kurrachee. Two ships of war will be left hereto maintain the occupation until the terms of the treaty have been fulfilled. General Jacob will De m command at Bushire which place, as also the island of Karrack, will re'mein in our safe keeping until the Persians have evacuated Herat, and made the stipulated apologies to the British mission. Major Taylor, of the mission, who has lately been employed as political secretary to Sir James Outram, Captain Malcobm Green, his military secretary, and fieutenant Clarke, one of his aides-de-camp, have been selected to accompany Mr. MIurray to Teheran, and to proceed from thence to Herat, to see that the Shah fulfils his engagements with respect to Herat and Affghanistan. These gentlemen leave to-day for Bagdad in the Comet. The Persian Commanders-in-Chief before Bushire and Shuster have evinced the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with us, and to receive our assurances that hostilities are at an end. Their armies have received several lessons which, we trust, will not soon be forgotten. I have not heard what Sir James Outram intends doing when all these preparations have been carried out, but it is not to be supposed that the Government will detain bim here in command of a division. Eis services are much more caled for in Inuia, and it is sincerely to be hoped that his rumowed elevation as military member to the Supreme Council of Indiao on the retirement of General Loowe wrill take place imneodiately. No nan is better qualified for tha post, and in the presft state of the Sepoys iii the Bengal Presidene; i ia iB &it deirable that a man of his knowledge lid gperience b1hould have a voice in the councils of Ilu," In the course of a month, e Qx weeks ai the furthest, there will be at Bombay a disposable foroD1 of 5,000 men-men whose conduct throughout the Peruan expedition has exhibited the beat qualities of British soldiers. Should the army in China require reinforcement, the Government could not do better than avail itself of the aervicee of theme veteransi I am no eulogist, and do not profess to be capable of forming a decided opinion on such matters, but the uniform testimony of aU ranks here is that the late Persian expedition has been conducted, in every way, so as to deserve the highest encomiums. To the Bombay Government the greatest praise is due for the alacrity and providence which they have displayed in forwarding such an abundance of supplies tbat nothing has been wanting, and every department has done its work admiably. The soldiers have behaved nobly, both before the enemy and in camp; and the Indian navy deserve to receive some mark of a Sovereign's acknowledgment for their really prompt and valuable services during this war.
IRELAIN. THE BROADSTONE MURDER. (BY ELECTRIC AND INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPHL) DUBINI , WEDNESDAY EvYNiNa The Maia of this evening announces that, after several weeks spent in a bootless inquiry-after over and over.again declaring that the murderer was well known, and ere 24 hours elapsed he would be in custody-now, after the lapse of ixr months, the murder having been committed so far back as the 13th of Noveraber, an arrest has been made, and one person, at aU events, a painter named Spollen, stands charged with perpetrating that atrocious murder. The evidence upon which Spollen was this morning arrested was that of his own wife, which, being illegal, will require other evidence to sustain the charge. Spollen was employed, it appears, as a painter in the office of the Midland Railway, and his wife's information is to tbhs effect: -She swears that Spollen painted Mr. Little's room a few days before the murder. She declares that on the night of the murder Spollen returned to his residence about 8 o'clock, bringing a quantity of gold and silver; that he told her it was Little's money, and that he had killed him. She saw him burn a pocketbook and also his cravat; that she saw him cover with paint the bloodstains ou his clothes, and that he told her he had made his escape through the roof, after committing the murder. She assisted to conceal the money, and she further stated that the bag of silver found was Spollen's, and the bag was placed in the trunk by Spollen; that the hammer found was Spollen's, and she believed the razor also, as he appeared very nervous the dayit was found, and said he had thrown it in with the case on, and if the case were discovered it wrould no doubt be identified. She further stated that she knew where the money was concealed, and would show the police the place. At 2 o'clock to-day Superintendent Guy accompanied the woman, and found between two walls, within the precincts of the railway terminus, a large portion of the missing money, consisting of gold, bank-notes, and silver. The notes from the damp were nearly destroyed. Spollen will be brought up for examination tomorrow. He is at present at the (Ihancery-lane station-house.
LYCEUM PEBATRB. A novel experiment was made last night. Dean Milman's tragedy FLazio, rendered into Italian by Signor F. Dall'Ongaro, was brought out with Madame Ristoui in tho principal part. Few characters are more familiar to playgoers, old and young, than is Bianca in this well. known tragedy. The old recoUect the production of Fazio at Covent-garden in 1818, when Bianca was represented by Miss O'Neill, Miss SomerviUe having played it at Bath a few weeks before. The younger patrons of the drama wiU bear in mind that Bianca first introduced Miss Ccsbman to the London public, and has always been one of the favourite parts in the repertory of Miss Glyn. In some few respects the Italian version of Fazio differs from the ordinary acting version used on the English stage, but the difference does not in the slightest degree affect the development of the principal character. The purport of Dean Milman's language has been faithfully reproduced by Signor Dall'Ongaro, though that gentleman has not always found equivalents for the very vigorous expressions with which the original play abounds. In short, the EAizabethan tone of the English play has been softened down in its passage to the Italian stage. The version, we are informed, was made expressly for Madame Ristori's London engagement, so that last night she performed the character for the first time in any theatre. It was not till the third act that sho put forth all her strength. Even throughout the second act, when the jealousy of Bianca is seriously aroused, she allowed the affectionate feeling so much to predominate that a spectator who witnessed the play for the first time could scarcely have foreseen the ternble catastrophe. But in the very first scene of the third act, when morning has arrived and Fazio has not returned home, she cast away all restraint, and the rapid questions which she addressed to the servant man, in the hope of not hearing the truth, constituted the most perfect representation of despairmin anxiety. Stillmore impressive wasthe delirium ofjo in which she resolved to inform against her husband, and thus snatch him from the arms of her rival. There is no doubt that in this proceeding Bianca commits a blundersoexceedingly gross as to interfere with the probabilityof theplot; but Madame Ristori lessens the improbability by her revelation of the state of nmind in which the fatal mistake is made. So suddenly and vividly does the thought flash upon her that it allows no opportunity for reflection; and when, rushing off the stage, she exclaims,- "A lA I Vale pervolare avest!" it is with a flight both in words and action that takes away the breath. The trial-scene, with its transition from calm triumph to the deepest humiliation of remorse and grief, is, of course, finelyrenderedby MadameRistorL Thesternfigure,whenshe stands as the accuser, like an immovable statue of justice, her agonized surprise, when she learns the doom she has brought upon her husband, her wild supplications for mercy, are aUl admirable, but for the main peculiarities of Uladame Ristori's performance we would refer to the fifth act of the play. When she is taking the last farewell of her condemned husband, and is hinatingat a thought she entertained of murdering her children, she answers the horrible smspicions that arise in his mind with an ecsatic expression of fondness that is illustrated by one olathe noblest attitudes conceivable,- Vivono, DIo rnserc, vivono anoora." I-a the trial scene, when she hears the sentence passed on her husband, her first impulse is to rush toward him, as if by her own strength she would guard him from every danger; and in the fifth act, when the oficers come to lead him away to execution an opportunity occurs for a further elaboration of this idea. " Ti faro scudo," exclaims Bianca in the Italian (not in the English) version, and she literally assumes the semblance of a EhielN, vwhen Fazio is to be torn from her arus. When she awakens from the stupor into 'which she has fallen, and finds that she is alone, she ventures on one of the most daring pictures of despair ever witnessed. Fazio has been led off to the scaffold. Her instinct leads her in the same direction. At first she is crawling off on her knees ;-then she makes an effort to rise;-then she faUs, but still sbe does not pause;-the will is so strong that it cannot be checked by bodily impediment. In the last scene, when she rushes almost insane into the midst of the banqueting-hall, she allows full scope to her power, the mUost remarkable featares being the manner in which, by pressing her hands to her head, she gives a lengthened physical expresAion to her maddeniDg sensations, and that dreamy mysticism in dying, of which we have had so fine a specimuen in Caomma,. So highly delighted were he audience by Madame Ristori's representation of a well-known English character that they called her, not only at the end of every scene, but at the end of every situation.
DEATH oF LOXD ALVALSY.-We have to announce the death of Lord Alvanley, who expired at halfpast 3 o'clock yesterday morning at his residence in Brutonstreet, Berkeley-square. The deceased peer had been sufferirsg from gout during the last four months. He was seized by serious symptoms on Friday last, which did not yield to medical treatment, and he eventually died from exhlustion at the hour before named. The deceased, Richard Pepper Arden, was third son of Richard, first Lord Alvaniey, by Anne Dorothea, sister of the late Lord Skelmersdale. He was born on the 9th of April, 1791, and married on the 25th of June, 1831, Lady Arabella Vane, fifth daughter of the late Duke of Cleveland, by whom he leaves no issue. The late peer succeeded to the title on the death of his brother in 1849. He had formerly been in the army, and retired soon after he had attaitned the rank of lieutenant-colonel. By the death of his lordship the peerage becomes extinct. Tnn LATE EXTRAORDiwAity ASSAlTT CASE AT ButTilliGHA1i.-Tbe iDdictment preferred by Mir. Hodgson, the ex-Mayor of Biriningham, against Mr. R.

!PHE 2 RIAZIL SOUTHIAZTON, Jun 24. The screw steamer Teutonia, belonging to '!he HamburA and Brazilian Company, Captain Malohin, arrived tn&. af dr uoon froni the Brazils. She left Rio do Janeiro onthe i,,tb o May, Bahia the 23d, Pernambuco the 26th, and adeira the 16th of Jnne. Having broken one of the fanJ of her screw on the 1st of Jane the mails and pasengers for Lisbon wore landed at Madeira and sent on by packetboat, so that the Tentonia did not call at that port. She will go into graving.d.ock here immediately, to have a new screw Sited, and will proceed on to Hamburg in a few days. The Tentonia has 52 pia'sengers (26 for this place and the same number for Hambbui'T); and on freight she hs diamonds value 2,163Z. sterling, 5.906 bags of coffee, 50 bags of cocoa, 399 mangotes, 2,300 balea of tobacco, S parcels containing cigars, fruit, and sundries, carrels, 2 capmand 10 scrons of merchandise, the whole for Bmburg. F.rom Rio the Teutonia's datesare only twa dayslater than those by the Teviot, and she comequently brings no news. The following cargoes of coffee are reported a having been cleared for exportation on the 16th of May, v=i.- per MIaxwell, for New York and Baltimore, 2,W27bags; E. Johnston, for Copenhagen, 1,186 bags; Phipp, for the United States, 930 bags; different ports, 2 bags; being a tofal of 4,745 bags. The whole amount cleared from the lit of the month to the 16th was 149,854 bag. Our correspondent at Pernambuco writes as follows on the 26th - "Since we last addressed you by the Teviot on the 22d inst. very little change has taken plaoe in our market. White sugars, however, are in better demand, and prices tend upwards, about 200 reis per arroba. No stock of muscovado left for sale. " The Dante, from St. John's, Newfoundland, came up this morning with a cargo of codfish. " Exchange.-27id. at 60 das sight. Nothing done since the Teviot sailed. " Freights.-A vessel has been engaged for the Mediterranean at 50s. and 5 per cent." Two Austrian and two American ships of war were at Madeira on the 16th inst.

THE UOTTOH SUPPLY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I take the liberty of drawng your attention to tho following facts, which have been brought to light at the meetings held in Lancashire with the view of endeavouring to obtain an increased supply of cotton. hlr. Aspinall Turner stated that in 1847, with an import of 1,234,000 bales, we had a 20 weeks' supply of cotton on hand; that in 1856, with double this consumption, we ended the year with eight weeks' smpply on hand. The crop of the presentyear was nearly one-fifth short of an average one, and December vill probably see us all but run out. Mr. Ashworth stated that already most of the mills were beginning to work four days a week, and that the stoppage of a mill of 100 horse-power for a single day cost the owner Indead loss above 2001. Lord Stanley stated that we had then above 160,000 horse-powor of steam engines employed in driving cotton mills. The stoppage of these for two days costs the mill spinners 640,0001., orfora working eason of 20 weeks about 13,000,0001. sterling. Lord Stanley stated that some years since a rise of Id. a-pound on cotton caused an extra payment to America of .5,000,0001. sterling; Mr. Aahworth stated that a similar rise at the present time would occasion us a loss of 10,000,0001 The sacrifice of the 23,000,0001. thus incurred must on the present occasion be borne as best it may. It were something worse than insanity to run the risk of incurring it again. It is universaly admitted that Americahaving introduced the highest garden cultivation, and taxed slave labour to the uttermost, has at length given us all the cotton she can ever hope to' supply; it is equally allowed that India, were her resoarces properly worked out, could give us in five years' time twice as anuch as would meet the present demand. It appeas from the statistical reports of the East Endia Company that the quantity of cotton exported from India has during the past 20 years scarcely at all increased, and that when she sends more to England in any given season she just sends so much the less to China and other countries -a fact diagraeoful beyond measure, and without precedence in the annals of agriculture. The Court of Directors allow that were the valley of Berar connected with Bombay by railway Liverpool could got all the cotton she wants for 2,d. a-pound, all land and sea charges included. Tho distance is short of 400. miles. The cost of construction of railways in India is 5,0001. a-mile, or 2,000,000L in all, a sum which would be covered by three months of the extra ld. to America, or three weeks of the sacrifice occaioned by working short time, It Is just four years since this admisdlon ws made by the Court of Directors. Sinco then they have contrived to construct some 50 miles of the Berar line. The remainder has not so much as been sanctioned up to the present hour, and we shall probably have five years' correspondence before the first bar is laid. Cotton of the very best quelity can be purchasod from the culttvator at from lid. to 2d. per lb. About double this is expended on transport charges. A twelvemonth ago a large body of Ratiawar merchants undortook to construct a cotton pier in the Gulf of Cambay, on the terrltories of an independent chief, and just opposite Ghora Bunda, where Government lamented their inability to construct one, and leave wae refus:d them by the Bombay aa-horities. Lord Elphinstone, on visiting the Chief of Bhownuggar in 1854, recommended bim to constract a pier, to make roads, and to establish cotton presses. The chief replied that all these things had been long in his contemplation; that he was quite ready to proceed with them immediately if Government would only undertake not to strip him of his dominions. A body of Bombay native merchants applied for leave to construct a tide basin for cargo boats at the presidency on any terms or conditions Government were pleased to impose. Permission was refused them. An irr gation company was established at Bombay in I854, and half a miilion of stock immediately applied for at the presidency. Terras every way satisfactory were granted by the Bombay Governmert. The survey is now completed, and operations ready to be commenced, when the supreme Government steps in and pronounces the terms too advantageous. For the past 12 months the copartnery has been memorializing Cannon-row and Leadenhall-street, and applying to Parliament forpapers, and that withthe cordialconcurrence of the Bombay Government, but have failed up to this hour to obtain any answer asto the terms likely to be granted them. Meanwhile the silver pinch threatens to be as severe as the cotton one. Until 18S0 India used to import from 1,000,0001 to 2,000,0001. of specie more than she exported. Within the past five years she has imported and retained 40,000,0001. Within the present 12 months she will have imported 15,000,0001. sterling beyond her exports, or onethird beyond the total annual production of all the mines in the world. We are thus producing a financial crisis and threatening a revolution in France, as we are provoking a famisbing population to insurrection. Not only will every bale of cotton we drawv from India require to be paid for b; silver, but as silver grows scarcer cotton will become relatively dearer, and while we suffer the people to continue naked barbarians silver is the only thing they will accept f;or their raw produce The effurts of the benevolent on the spot to improve the agriculture of the country, elevate the tastes and habits of the people, and diffase practical instruction have been neglected and laughed at by the authorities. The education despatch of 1854 recommends a provision to be made for viDg instruction in agriculture and rural economy, and the Conrt of Directors sends out professors of metaphysics, of English literature, and the applico sciences for men who can neither read nor write. We spend 100,0001. a year in education, and bestow 50,000L as salaries on a body of inspectors, the bulk of whom were themselves never educated in any useful branch of knowledge whatever, and could never have had the slightest acquaintance with the practice of education, some of whom were in long clothes when the professors whose classes they inspect had become distinguished as public teachers. Your obedient servant. GEORGE BUIST. 11, Plymouth-grove, Manchester. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TINIES. Sir,-As one who bas resided for many years in tudialshall feel obliged if you will allow me a corner to state, in refererce to Mlr.

FOREIGN INTELLIBENaB. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWVN COBRESPONDEp!.) - portion o tJio following appexod in our second Odition of Vyc3tab :-] PARIS, TurDAY, JVNB 23, 6 P.u. The result of the Paris elections which I transmitted last night by telegraph is pretty much as I anticipated: two or three of the Opposition candidate3 have obtained a triumph in Paris. I say two or three, as, in consequence of not having obtained the abeolute majority-that is, one-half of the total votes plus one-General Cavaignac wiLl have to go through a new election. His majority, relatively to his opponent, M Thibaut, is only 23T. At the second election he wilL not be required to have the absolute, but merely the relative, majority. As to his success on this second essay opinion is divided. Some balieve that he will still be the elected; others, on the contrary, affirm that every one who would have voted for him has voted that his list will consequently not be swelled by any additional names, and that such electors as were too indolent or too much occupied to come to the poll will, when compelled to ap,ear, vote for his opponent. The second election commence in 15 days. The fifth and sixth are the arrondis3ements where the other Opposition candidates, M. Carnot and M. Goudchaux, have obtained each a considerable majority. In the last-mentioned division the Government candidate waas M. Perret, a man by all accounts generally and deservedly popular. Yet, in spite of his great influence among the working classes, the fact of his being the Government candidate sufficed to defeat him. M. Perret, it seems, has suffered from the effects of excessive zeal on the part of his friends. Independently of the ordinary placards announcing the name of the candidate, another one appeared for some days, in which five or Bix working men strongly recommended to their fellow-operativea to elect M. Perret, on the ground of his being the friend of the industrious. Nothing can be more suspicious than a Parisian; so earneat a recommendation was pronounced to be the work of the police, and it cost M. Perret at least 1,000 votes. The hasty sketch I gave you yesterday of the arrondissements, paertlcularly the 3d and 6th, will probably have prepared you for the result. The bourgeoisaie of the 3d ha.s given its lesson to the Government, and the oparatives of the 6th have not forgotten 1848. M. de Laboulaye, whose name the Journsal des Deoats puts forward, with, I have no doubt, the best intentions, has met with the fate he deserved. The representative of the juste milieu, of moderate opinions, equally removed from Absolute and from Revolutionary doctrines, stands in the returns mid way between the candidate of the former and the organ of the latter. The Government candidate has 10,070 votes; the Dats' Parliamentary representative, 4,076; and the Democratic, 1,682. Poor M. Gamier Pagas has been left in a pitiable condition. Certainly the " Ancients" have no cause to glory in their champion. The " Young" adversary, whom he treated wiith such sats fafon, and with whom hw difference grew to downright personal hostility, may console himself for his own defeat in the fourlh arrondissement, antd for the triumph of the Government candidate, when he sees his elder brother Democrat 4,000 votes below him. As to the question of taking the oaths to the Emperorlcan saynothing; it would be onlyawaste of precious time to repeat the many opinions expressed on that point. One thing, however, I can affirm is, the deep mortification felt by the authorities at the result. Each now tries to transfer the blame from his own shoulders to those of his friend or colleague. The Prefect of Police will not admit that the fault is his; any one vwho wishes may take the responsibility, but he will not. You hear low murmurs of satisfaction on the part of shopkeepers without number, who are suspected of revenging themselves for their wives and daughters being so often forgotten when baL and other entertainments were given at the Hotel de Vile. Formerly there was a certain number of tickets issued to the MiTyors of the arrondissements on these important occasions. Since Mi. (or, I believe, Baron) Haussmann has swayed the sceptre of the Prefecture the invitations have become less liberal-" fine by degrees, and beautifully less." Then, again, we have complaints, not merely of M. Haussmani's " deportment," but also of his circulars. Your Parisian bourgeois, though a terrible philosopher, and professing the greatest indifference on such matters, is one of the most susceptible of beings. As a Radical, he looks down upon them an unworthy of occupying a serious mind, brtt he never will forgive a real or fancied slight. Thea, again, the circulars of the Minister of the Interier are criticized with much bitterness. I "M. Billault," it was said in several polling-booths yesterday-" iM. Billault has forced the country to decide-and we have decided. We hope he is satisfied." The Democrats of Paris state with satisfaction that they have gained a majority of 10,000 votes over the Government in the eight circumscriptions I within the walls, and that it is the two circumscriptions aetra mvusros that made up the Government majority. As I write, a private despatch from Lille, just received, announces a majority of 7,000 votes in favour of the Opposition candidate (Jules Braun) in that city. A despatch, also private, states that at Bordeaux M. Curd, the Opposition candidate, has likewise been elected. Another, that Dr. Henon (Opposition)has been elected at Lyons, and a rumour though not generally credited) that Jules Favre Opposition) bas also triumphed. The following rettmns have been received Lisieux.-M Am6dee Rend, Government candidate, was returned by a majority of 13,000 votes out of 17,000 voters. Marseilles.-Edmond Canaple, Government caadidate. Aix.-M. Rigaud, Government candidate. Doubs.-The Duke de Conegliano against the Count de Montalembert. Gironde.-M. Arman against M. David. Somme.-Ajl the Government candidates, except M. Delamarre. Tarn-et-Garonne.-M. Belmontel. Rhone.-AUi the Government candidates, except M. Cabias. Hautes Pyren6es.-M. Achille JubinaL Gers.-Granier de Cassagnac. Loiret.-Duke de Tarente and Nogent St. Laurens. The Pays, Ministerial journal, says that the result of the elections surpasses all the hopes of the friends of the Empire. Out of 200 elections known at present in Paris the united Opposition have not returned more than six or eight of their candidates, including thoae in Paris. The Pays adds, that even in Paris the elections have a particular signification. The real contest was in the third circumscription, where all the Opposition force was concentrated, and there General Cavaignac only polled 10,345 votes, 4,123 less than in the year 1852. Admiral Hamelin has ordered that the frigate Alceste shall be prepared for sea at Brest, to convey an Admiral to Rio Janeiro, to relieve Admiral la Roque de Chaufray, who commands the French naval force at that port and in the Plata. It having been observed that the French Consuls and Consular agents abroad are not sufflciently informed with respect to the population and commerce of the countries in which they are stationed, orders have been sent to them that every two years they shall make a tour to the extent comprised in the exequabur granted by the Power to which they are accredited. It is rtunoured that, in consequence of the dis. covery of a plot connected, more or less, with the present election movement, four Italians have been arrested. The plot is, if we can depend on report, of a most serious nature. Papers and firearms are said to have been found on the prisoners.

The total calm that reigns just now in European politics is beginning to fill the unquiet spirit of the Northern Bee with apprehension. Accustomed as this talented journal is not only to know everything that is going on in the rest of the world, but also to know what is going to happen at any future time, the Bee is disposed to find danger lurking in the very fact that it cannot find out that any danger to Russia exists anywhere, and still less where the next danger is to come from. Ia the absence of any novelties in the danger line it returns to the old refrain, "Turkey is going to the dogs,"-this time it is shown to be in consequence of the exhaustion produced by the late war. It takes care, however, to I add that Turkey must not in future look to j Russia for help, as she did in 1833, and suggests 1 mysteriously that when the time comes the neutrality 1 of the Black Sea will not be found of much avail to save her. As an evidence that the old adage "Wonders wil1 never cease" isl still in force, the Northern Bee steps forward as the apologist of the Belgians with reference to the late popular demonstrations in Brussels. While protesting against the possible inculpation of pleading In favour of disorder and- popular violence, it maintains that the I objeotius of the people to t-heproposed law were founded on the Charter and admnts only that they might have enforced their objection in a more legal manner. The tone that this leading organ of the Russian press now assumes towards England is also a good deal milder than formerly; it gives itself some trouble to make its resignation appear sincere wbile finding Lord Palmerston is now all-powerful, and professes to believe that, though the Opposition appeers to be collecting its forces for a fresh encounter, there will not so soon again be any trial of strength between him and them. The only body corporate or individual that the Northern Bee can find in England to pick a quarrel with justi at present is l'he Ti1nes, and this opportunity is found ap~ropos of the great Siberian line of railway that the Northern Bee wants to see constructed to run from Nishni Novgorod to anywhere eastward that can be found on Mercator's projection of the two hemispheres. It is pointed out with great clearness and convincing eloquence of what advantage it would be to the world if the commerce of Central Asia, China, and Japan were thus to be put into connexion with the Russin network of railways, and thus be brought home to Europe; and much weight is laid on the following I three remarks, as axdoms of indisputable trathnamely, 1. The Euphrates Railway is being got up and concocted solely for the advantage and profit of England; 2. the passage of the Isthmus of Panama does not offer half the advantage to the world that the Siberian line does; and 3, the uncertainty or the unsafeness of the line of the Euphrates or of that across Suez could not be thought of in connexion with a line. of railway in the pomsession of Russia. (Why the paasage of the Isthmus of Panama was not mentioned among the unsafe routes is not explained.) That "dreadful Times" took upon itself to laughat this Siberian scheme from the very moment It was Proposed, and it did the same by the great plan of thie network of railways in Russia, a line of conduct which moves the Northern Bee to the following fearful threat :- " That serpent of the press was hissing all the late war, and It is hissing still, though only in a different tone. Btt let it rage on, what harm Is that to us? Only le it once come under our foot and we'll crash it, and there wll be an end of the thing; for it won't so easily bite through a Russian boot." How very dreadful this would all be if it were only intelligible! The Journal for Shuareholders lately published an article to evidence the new life which the spirit of enterprise had gained in Russia. To do this it quoted the rise of prices which the shares of the various industrial companies had attained of late. Though the number of these companies is as yet far from great, it is certainly increasing slowly but certainly, and as the means of communication with the rest of Europe are further developed the rate of increase may be expected to increase also. With some few exceptions, in which the quotations of the shares have remained stationary or even receded, during the past year shares in general have advanced. The shares of the Second Insurance Office against Fire, for instance, have risen 40 per cent.; of the Steam Navigation Company on the Wolga, 34 per cent.; the Assurance Company " Salamander," 26 per cent.; and a Company fdr Cotton Manufactures, 14 per cent. The Russo-American Company's shares have gone up to the double, seeing that they pay 12 per cent. dividend on the amount paid up; at the present prices, therefore, a buyer only gets 6 per cent., while buyers of shares in most other companies get from 7 to 10 per cent. It must, however, be borne in mind that these large profits have been obtained only by favour of a prohibitory tariff, which is about to be' so far modified as m many cases to admit of foreign importation. The most recent scheme of a joint-stock company in Russia is for the construction of bridges. According to the Journal de St. Petersbourg the first stone of a new spinning mill and weaving works was laid May the 12th in the island of Eronholm, between the two cataracts of the Narova, and if all that is said of this future establisbment be true it bids fair to be the largest of the kind in the world. Window frames for 1,672 windows, and nozzles for 20,000 gas jets have been ordered for it. Between (60 and 80 vessels are to be constantly occupied in conveying the cotton to Narva, and 3,000 hands are to be as constantly occupied in spinning and weaving the twist. It will take three years before the building is completed, but it is intended to commence spinning at the end of the first year. This is a joint-stock speculation, founded evidently on a knowledge of the forthcoming tariff; and the technical direction is in the hands of an Englishman named Barlow. ITALY. (FROM OUR OWN coRsMoNrDENr.) TURIN, JuNx 20. To-day we have intelligence of another address to the Pope, which is to be presented to him on bis arrival at Ferrara. The citizens of Ferrara, profiting by the example of Bologna, resolved on making known their grievances to the head of the State during his visit to their town, if possible, and to that effect have presented an address to their Gonfaloniere which, for boldness of language and distinctness in pointing out the evils complained of, is suiperior to that drawn up by the Bolognese. The address bears the signatures of 40 of the most ir-fluential citizens of the place, 15 of whom are Municipal Councillors. On its first being read to .he Gonfaloniere he made no observation either of approval or dissent; but in about an hour after he again met the deputation which had presented it to aim, and told them he could not undertake the charge assigned him. The deputation, however, persisted, and in the end succeeded in persuading the Gonfaloniere that it was his duty to comply with the request of his fellow-citizens. The address runs as follows:- "Excellenoy,-Wben the Supremo Pontiff determined on visiting the provinces of his own States no doubt was entertained that the principal cause of this journey was love and solicitude for his own subjects, and the noble aim of substantially improving their prospects. Strong in this conviction, we do not think we shall offend the majesty o the Prince by opening to him our minds, and showing him the wants of the country, but, on the contrary, give him indisputable proof of the faith we place in his good intentions, and in the love of good that pervades his paternal heart. 1" Tho internal condition of these provinces is very far from satisfactory, and, to the eye of those -who govern us even, the permanent discord which exists between the tendencies of the rulers and the honest and liberal aspirations of the people, which is the natural consequence of the spirit of the age and of civilization, cannot have escaped notice. Great are the abuses committed in the name of the Sovezign. The legislation is imperfect; the ecclesiastical element preponderates; and arbitrary measures falsify and annul the spirit of good lass , as is proved by the unexecuted law of the year 185S on the formation of the musnicipaitieo. " Wise and liberal reforms, sheltered from every midnterpretation aud restriction, are, In our view, the only valid Imeansofpttingan end tosuch e and it 'will be eur to the lofty and benignant mind of the Sovereign Pstifft b perceive, amneg all thos which are peeablo, what refeina are to be made for tbe sake of the publc g aod- "onfident that your Eelisaic , beng fully penaaaed of the opporttmeneS of this our step, will wraraly ant hum,bly expross our sentiments to the tSovereign, " We hava tfhe honour, &ac. "Ferrara, June 6,1857." I understadthe reception of Cavaliere Boncompagni, the Sardinian Eavoy, by the Pope a, Bolognev was markedly courteous on the part of his Holiness, and the conversation was strictly o' a complimentary nature, both parties carefully avoiding any allusion to the estrangeraent betweca the Governments of Rome and Sardinia. The interview took place in the presence of Cardinal Coral, Archbishop of Pisa, and Cardinal Vannicelli, Archbishop of Ferrara. During his short stay in Bologna aU the principal, inhabitants left cards with Cavaliere Boncompagai, in testimony of their respect for the Government he represented there, and it is said that the demonstration of sympathy would have been still more openly and unequivocally displayed by the leaders of society if they had not feared that by doing so they might have led their humbler felow-citizens into such a display of feeling as the police or Austrian authorities could have laid hold of to impose fresh restrictive measures. The Criminal Court of Parina has just acquitted the political prisoners /handed over to it for trial by the " mixed" military tribunal on the raising of the state of siege. According to the evidence elicited in the course of the p geent trial, both from credible witnesses and from the prisoners themselves, the most atrocious means appear to have been resorted to by the military courts in order to obtain condeinatory evidence against the accuse The horror excited in the country by the positive proof of sach infamous proceedings is, of 'course, very great, particularly when it is remembered how many persons, who, perhaps, were as innocent as those now a¢qcuitted, were executed by serntence of a court-martial, and that the very men now set at liberty would probably have suffered death had the state of siege been continued only a few short weeks loDger. The British squadron, under commiand of Admniral Lord Lyons, which anchored in the port of Cagliari the other day, left there again on the 19th, and is expected at Spezzia about the 26th, whence, after a few days, it will probably come to Genoa, having in the meantime taken a look at other parts of the coast of Italy. From Genoa it is ex: pected Lord Lyons will come to Trin, to pay his respects to the King of Sardinia and visit General Dela Marmora,with whom he served in the last war. His squadron at present consists of the Royal Albert, Conqueror,Centurion, and Brunswick, screw ships of the line; Curacoa, steam frigate; Ariel, steam corvette; and Osprey and Wanderer, steam gunboats. The Italis del Popolo, of Genoa, states, on the authority of persons coming from INaples, which it says is confirmed by private correspondence, that another attack had been made on the life of the King of Naples at (Gaeta on the 11th inst., and that Hi3 Majesty was slightly wounded. This report has been repeated here to-day by all the papers of Turin, but evidently received by themn with great suspicion, as they carefully quote the source of their information. SPAIN. (FROM OUD OWN CO;BUr>DowMT.) MADRID, Juxx 19. The complaints concerning the 'slave trade in Cubs are stronger and more frequent than ever, and persons well informed on the matter assure me that at no time since its existence has the treaty been more flagrantly violated in the Spanish West Indies than during the latter period of General Conchaes command. To the remonstrances addressed to it the Spanish Government makes the usual reply. Tha British agents, it says, make exaggerated, not to say erroneous, statements,anditknows, from theverybast and highest source, that the slave trade is completely stopped in Cuba. But this excellent source of Senor Pidal's knowledge is no other than General Conchs, who, as is perfectly well known here, gets a handsome douceur for every slave imported. This is an extremely notorious fact, and it is impossible to believe the Spanish Government is so badly informed as not to be fully aware of it. General Concha showed, during the period of his former command in Cuba, that he could, when he pleased, effectually check the traffic. There is no reason for its suppression being more difficult now than then. Yet cargoes of slaves are continually landed, and vessels are fitted and sail, almost without a pretence of disguise, in and from Cuban ports for the Arican coast. It is for the British Government to consider how far it will permit the policy it has made such sacrifices to carry through to be baffled by the bad faith and wilful blindness of Spain and her West Indian Viceroys. Lord Howden, who certainly does not allow the subject to sleep, has just sent in another, and, as I understand, a very strong note. One hardly dares to hope that it may have more effeebI than the many that have preceded it. The question of the coupons continues to be the subject of paragraphs and conjectures in the Spanish journals The Clamor PubliCo says that it learns from London and Amsterdam that the approachina recognition of those certificates was considered as almost certain on the Exchanges of those two cities Commenting on this, the semi-official Correspondeiwia persists in saying that nothing wiU be done speciaUly in favour of the coupons, but that it does not know what benefit may accrue to the holders from the general settlement or arrangement which it is said that the Government proposes to make in order to put an end to all sorts of claims (relamz. c ones) against the credit of Spain. You will be better able to judge than we are of the value of the Clamor's statement. As regardsthe Correspondencia,thenunasrousparabraphsithashadonthissubjectseemintendeI rather to bewvilder the public than to lead it to any just conclusion as to the intentions of the Spanish Government. Having no reason to tlAink that there is any change in the position and prospects of the affair since my recent communications regarding it, I should not advert to these Spanish newspaper reports but for the possibility that greater importance might be attached to them than they deserve. I believe the state of the case to be, that the Spanish Govermment, with a view to improve the credit of the country, and so to ward off impending financial difficulties, is disposed to do something in favour of the coupon-holders, but, aware that a measure to that effect would meet with strong, opposition, it hesitates to bring it before the Cortes. There are persons who think Ministers could carry the measure, but this is, to say the least, doubtful; and, supposing that they did, by a slender majority, the victory might stil be injurious to them, owing to the senseless but strong popular prejudice against the recognition of this repudiated portion of the debt, owing also to the damaging attacks that it would give rise to in the Chambers and in the press. Another course open to them-that, namely, of settling the matter by decree during the recess--would, some think, be the safest. At present, all that appears to me certain is the disposition of the Government to do tardy justice to the coupon-holders; not, perhaps, from mere love of justice or out of consideration to foreign creditors, but because they feel that not to grant it is to keep down the funds and injure their own interest. In short, Senor Bravo Murillo's policy in this matter is recognized to have been a grievous mistake, the effec', of which now make themsves sharply felt. Bravo Mur!iUo, howeve, is not disposed to admit that he errea, ana, should a measure wholly or partially repealing his be proposed, he is prepared to fight the bad fight of repudiation with all the force he can muster. As to the dmajority of the Spanish pra s and public, which set their faces against such a measure, it is labour lost to reason with them. Th ?y are obstinately blind to the advantages Spain would derive from re-entering, after a long aberration, upon the path of honesty, and persist incessantly, as does the Espana to-day, in one cuckoo cry,-thAt the coupon question has been judged and settled without appeal. 1 understand that Mr. Stokes, who was in Madrid some time ago, as representative of the interests of the coupon-holders, is here again on a similar errand. There is a report that the Government is about to ask permission of the Cortes to put in force the law on the press previouslv to its discussion. It is difficult to believe that so arbitrary a measure will be resorted to. The law is sure to pass, and to discuss it before instead of after its proclamation woul1 be a saving but of a few days. The ground for the report, probably, is the scandalous height to which party polemics have attained among many of the papers, and the divisions among the Moderado party to which these give rise. Such a violent and per- sonal controversy has lately been going on between } the Dira,-o Apanol and the Orbs that the Govern- ment has interfered to stop it, in consequence of 1hich the latter journal has suspended its publi- The Three per Cents. wee done at 40.55; ditto, Defred, 26.30.

The plaintiff, Colonel Williams of the Anglesey Ligot Infantry, was owner of some lana which it was contended the defendants' plans would injutiously affect, but, after divers negotiations the plaintiff had consented not to oppose the defendants obtaining an Act of Parliament to construct these works, upon their paying him the costs incurred by his opposition and about w00I-;consequential damages. An agreement to this effect wa s 'ed by the chairman of the promoters on the 23a of July,? 183, by the terms of which the chairman, on behalf of imself and the other promoters, agreed to pay to Colo nel Willams 2501. out of tho 2,0001. when the companuys Act was obtained, and the remainder before the company began the construction of theirbranch railway. In August, 1853, the company obtained their Act, under which they became incorporated, and in July following the plaintiff recovered judgment against them, by consant, for the first instalment of his 2,00DI. In the month of May in the present year the plaintiff learnt that the company were about to commence making their branch railway, and thereupon applied to them to complete their alleged contract under the agreement of July, 853.

VICE-CHANCELLORS' COURTS. .T17NR 9 OAVNVafrv - t(efors Yice: Oancdo Bfr SE. T. KiimDXmsLinY This cms was argued on tho 28th and29th of April and on the 8th of May last, when it was fully reported in The Times, and his Honour reserved his decision. The case elates to mortgage priorities, and is of the motsi complicteedksind,ndt ass the substance appears iu the judgment we rel . fardr appdeare for the plaintifb; r. lase,Mr.C. arbr, ndMr. Bevir for the The VicE CumIcELLOR. said that the question in this case wa whether the defendant Chichester was entitled to the benefit of a charge on certain premises in priority to the mortgage of the plaintffri. The facts were thee :-Cannock, the elder, was the owner of certain property called Wincolls, Taylors, two cottages, the Lamb and Bla Tnn, and other property, subject to encumbrances. In April, 1846, he contracted to seUlWincolls, Tylor, and the two cottages to his son for 6,0001. free from encumbrances. There had been a previous agreement, dated in February 1844, in writing, when the encumbrances only amouimtedto 4,0001., for sae of the enuity of redemption to the son for 1,2001. The mortgages in 1846 were these :- 'Upon Taylors for l,600L, to the trustees of Mrs. Bassett, but which in MAy, 1846, became vested in Chamberlain, one of the defendants; on Wincolls for 2,2001., to Thomas Higgins; on Taylors, Wincolls, and ether propertyfor 1,2001., to one Boulter; of the same propery for 1,5001. to Chichester; and of the Lamb and Flag and the two cottages to Elizabeth Higgins, for 8W01.-making 7,280,.; and as a collateral security for the 8801. a judgment for 1,7601. was confessed by the two Cannocks. The contract for sale by Cannock, the elder, imposed on himn the neoessaty of diaharging those mortgages, and the son, not having 6,000st , was obliged to borrow it, and give mortgages on the property for the amount, and he a plied to M ossr Higgins and Chamberlain to raise 40001. for him, to investigate the title, and complete the purchase, previously to which they had not acted as his socitors. Tley got the 4,0001. from Jauncey, and the wife of Cannock, the younger, having an absolute power by her settlement to appoint the 2,0001 was to be got from her trustees. There was some hesitation on their part, and it appeared meetings took place with them and a clerk of Messrsl. iggins ana Chamberlain, who represented the purchase as beneficial, and the sum was eventually lent. Arrangements were then made as to ping off the old mortgages, and making the new ones (which his Honour detailedl), hichester lending 1,3321. more, making in aU 1,83-11. due froma Cannock, the elder, and, Elisabeth Higgies's 8801. being paid off; she joining inconveying Six deeds were prepared and executed on the 25th of July, two being datedI the 7th-namely, a mortgae to Chichiester by Cannoclk, the elder, the 880. being paid to Elizabeth Higgins, who assigned the benefit of the judgment to Chichester; the conveyance to Cannock the younger, by his father, to which all the prior mortgagees were parties, and the others were the new mortgages by Cannoclr, the younger. The result was that Cannock, the elder, remained owner of the Lamb and Flag and his other property, and his son was owner in fee of the property purchased by him, discharged of all prior mortgages, and subject only to the new ones. In June. 1850, some changes having taken place in the holders of the mortgages, Elizabeth Higgins died, and the judgment was revived by scire facios. Canmock, the younger, became bankrupt in 1851, and Mrs. Cannock's trustees and the other mortgagees gave notice to pay off Jauncey, which was served on him and Chichester, and confirmed by Canuock, the younger. Higgins and Chamberlain then insisted on Chichester's prior right, by reason of the judgment, and JAuncey, notwithstanding the notice, transferred his mortgage t Chichester. An offer to redeema was again made to Chichester, but he refused unless the 8801. was paid to him. In April, 1852, an ejeotment was brought to recover the premises, in which aU parties having an interest were joined, but was not prosecuted, and a sale advertised, noticing the pendency of the action, but the day before the sale this bill was filed to establish the right to redeem, to postpone the judgment, and restrain the action and sale. It was clear that Higgins and Chamberlain acted as solicitors for all parties, except Mr Cannock and Cannock, the elder, and in this transaction for Cannocl; the younger; but they knew all the circumstances andtheintention of all parties,whowerebound by their acts. The conveyance to Cannock, the younger, must betaken tobeardatebefore the mortgae andif the time was ever so short it was long enough for the judgment to operate, and the question was whether in equity Chichester was entitled to the benefit of it. On the evidence his Honour was quite satisfied that the effect of its existence was entirely overlooked, and nothing could be imputed to messrs. Higgins and Chamberlain but a venial legal blunder. It was also clear that the mortgagees, including the plaintiffs, did not know of it, and would never have advanced their money if they had, and Jauncey acted very improperly with notice to transfer toChichester, and it was to be regretted that Messrs. Higgins and Chamberlain should have assisted Chicbester in so unrighteous a demand. If they had known the effect of the jadgment they would have been guilty of a great fraud, and would have been liable for the consequence. Chichester must be taken to have known that Mrs Cannock's trustees were advancing the 2,0001. on the assumption that the property was not subject to the judgment, he having received payment of 1,0001. out of the 2,0001. It was against all equity that he should be permitted to set up this charge. No negligence on the part of Mrs. Caunock's solicitor, if there were any, which did not appear, could justify it. He was not entitled to set up the judgment; the ijuanction must be made perpetual, sa the plaintiff was entitled to redeem. ChichestAr must pay the plaintiff's costs, including Cannock, the younger's, which the plaintiff must pay toJbim. None of the plaintiffi in the ejectment could have their costs, neither could Jauncey, who thought fit to transfer after notice, and Higgins. Chamboerlain could have no costs. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ouahaen (Before Yice- ChanceUor Sir J. SBUnP.T.) XIG V. KIG. This was a bill by a father and son against the trustees of the father's marriage Lettlement, for the purpose of obtainig payment of the funds in settlement to the plaintiffs, nnder the foUowing circumstances :-By indenture, dated in May, 1830, being the settlement made on the marriage of the plaintiff, Richard Henry Eing, and his late wife, a sum of about 14,000OL was vested in trustees upon trust to pay the interest during the joint lives of Mr. and Ms. King as therein mentioned, and after the death of either to the survivor, and after the death of the survivor upon trust, to stand possessed of the trust funds in trust for the children or remoter issue of Mr. and Mrs. King, as they or the survivorof them should jointly appoint, and in default of appointment on the trusts therein mentioned. Mrs. King died in May, 1l. The only issue of the marriage was the second plaintiff, Richard Twyford King, who attained his age of 21 years in May, 1856. In the ensuing July the father, in pursuance of the power contained in the indenture of May, 1830, appointed that the trust funds should go after his decease to his son R. T. King. Soon after the execution of the appointment of Jnly, 1856, the plaintiffs ayp8ed to the defendantr, who -were the trustees of the dee of May, 1830, for n transfer of the trust fnnds into tho joint names of the former. The defiendant thereupontoolc the opinion of eminent counsel at the equity bar, with whose requisitions the plaintiffs agreed to comply; hut the defendants subsequentl declined to transfer the fund, except under the directions of the Court. The defendants, the trustees, in their answer said that soon after the execution of the deed of appointment the plaintiffs applied to them to transfer the trust funds ito the joint n lantiffs, but that in Febraary, 1856, prior to the date of the deed of appointment, they received a letter from the father of 11. H. King, in which he expressed a desire to have the trust funds transferred into his own name only, and that they had been in'ormed and believed that the father had stated to their solicitor that a son ought to be dependent on hia father, and that his son had consented to give him the control of the trast funds, and trust to his honour to provide for him. The father denied having made any such statement as thata bove alleged. It was contended in the plaintifa' hbhalf that under the circumslances of the case the defendants, the trustees, should Pay the cost of the suit. I Mr. Malinx and Mr. B iL. Chapman were for the plan. tiff; 'Mr. Bacon aAd Mr. Wickems, forthe defendantsw were not ealled upon. The VICE- C EI,LOR said " this Court alwayx re- isrded with great jealousy transaotiong betWefn a father and a son who had just come of a8e. when the effect of those transactions was to put the bois propetty under the f.ther's controL It was the duty of tb trutmes to protect the son's interests, and they were not bound to adopt counel`s opinion. He did not think that the trustees had ed veatiously under the circemstauces of the ase in-declinimg to transfer the trast funds to the plaintiffs without the direction of the Court. As the son still whed the trust funds to be transferred into the joint names of himself and his father, there would be a decree to that effect, bat the plaintiffs must pay the costs of the suit. (Before Vc-ChanceUor Sr W. P. WOOD.) THE COLLINS CO0MPANY V. COHE. Mr. ROLT and Mr. EDDIS moved on behalf of the plain. tffs, who were members of a comipany formed in the United states for the purpose of manufacturng edge tools, for an injunction to restrain the defendant, who wau a merchant at Birmingham, from stamping, cutting, or engraving any tools manufactured or sold by him with the words " ColsinB aDd Co., Hartford; cast steel; warranted," or any words similar thereto, or so contrived asto lead to the belief thas such articles were the manufacture of the company. The case has already been before the Court upon a d- murer by the defendant, on the ground that the plaintiffs .being foreigners, could not asert in this country a right to a trade mark, and that the cme was not witbin the jins. diction of an English Court The. Vice-Chaneellor overtiled the demurrer, on the ground that every subject of every country was entitled to havea fraudulent injuryto his property arrested by the Courts of this country. The case upon demurrer is reprte in 2Xi Tim," of June 12. Mr. CAIRNS and Mr. C. SWAwSTO1, on behalf of the defendait, opposed the present motion for an injunction.

With respect to acquiescence'and delay, as alleged against the plaintifrb on behalf of the defendant, the allegations were too vague and indefinite to induce the Cout to give any weight to thetn. There was nothing stated- in theaffidavitupolntheseheads in Anyway to call foran nswr fom he laitifs. rcinjuncttoiox would be granted untl further order, the defiendant not requesting thhsat eagn alctin might be bronght by the plaintiffs to try TOWER V. WOODBR1DGE (TIZH CLERK TO THE IXBRIDGE DISTRICT LOCAL BOAD OF IHEALTH). Mr. ROLT and Mr. GsrpFAiD moved to commit the Urbridge Distrct Local Board of Health for breach of an injunction obtained by consent on the 2&l of April last, restrainungthem fromcausing any'overflowof theriver Colne sO as to flood or injure the plaintiffs property, and also from allowg any sewage to flow into the river Cole by means of their works otherwise than in a state deodoried and free from anything offensive. The motion also asked, in the alternative, that the defendants might be ordered to prevent any sewage from flowing from their works into the cole, or in default thereof tat they might stana committed to the Queen's Prison, It appeared that the defendants, who 'were constituted the Local Board of Health for the Ux. bridge district, under the Public Health Act3 of 1848and 1849, and a provisional order of the 14th of June, 1853, had oommenced a system of drainage for the district, the outfall of their sewer and works into the river Colue bing At a point immediately Above the plaintiffs propraty, lHunts_ more park, through which the CoIne, whic was a clear stream stocked withtrout, flowed. Aftersome negotiation, with a view to obviating the threatened injury to the plain. tifWs property from the outfall of the sewag and surfac drainago of the town, the bill had been iled to restrain any Interference by the defendants with tho stream of the river Coie at any point in their district above the plainti's property. An order had been mado by oonsent of both parties on the 23d of April last restraining the defendants from causing any overflow of the Colne so as to injure the plaintiffs property, and also from aUowing Any sewage to fowinto the river Colne by means of their works otherwise than in a state deodorized and free from any thing offensive Tho plaintiff now moved to commit the defendants for breach of this order. Various affidavits from seientific and otherwitnesses were read as to the'present state of the water below the outfalL Mr. CANs and Mr. BEALES, for the defendants, contendea, upon the evidence, that noinjury whatever wAs occasioned to any property either above or below the outfall, and that the injunction had been complied with in spirit and substance, and, at all events, to the best ability of the Board of Health. If thrownupon the strictmeaning of the word "deodorize," itmeant "ai-di hing"ratherthan entirely removing the noxious odour, nor could the water by any process be treted so as to render it pure as crystaL Tehe VICE.CHANCELLOR, without calling for a reply had no doubt but that the injunction had been infringed. home question niht arise as to the meaning of the word " deodorne" by 1%tsef, but taking the words "&deodorized and free 'from anything offensive" togethier, there coDuld be no doubt that the defendants were bound by the terms of the order to keep the water free from anything offensive in smell or any other way. It was said that it was impossible for science to effect this, but the order had been made with the consent of the defendants, and the plaintiff was contented to abide by it so long as the water was kept pure. The evidence of Dr. Ietheby on behalf of the defendant3 was, in fact, conclusive against them. (His Honour read from Dr. Letheby's affidavit, in which he admitted the presence in the stream belovr the outfall of five to seven grain of living and organic material, the only thing which could be of any annoyance, while above the outfall the proportion was one grain only of such organic material.) It appeared that there wasa oonsiderable increase of solid matter, and thatwater with an offensive smell bad been poured into the Co1ne, so that the order of the 23d of AprUi had been clearly infringed. As the plaintiff's cou did not Press for the actual committal of the defendants, the order would be to restrain the defendants from allowing any sewage to flow into the river Cofle above the plaintiffY's residence from and After the 28th of July without Leave of the Court. DENIS V. ROCRUSSEm. In this case, which came on by way of motion to restrain the defendants from selling cases and bottles of brandy with the labels used by the plaintiffs as their trade marl-, an order was nade to the follOwing effect :-Tho defendant RPckusse udertak-ing not to sell anY bottles of brandy with the plaintiff's trade mark until the heainng of the cause, the question as to his costs was directd to stand over. The other defendant (Price) was to be restrained by an injunction, but, as no application had been made to him before the institution of the suit, and it did not appear that he had acted fraudulently, or made any profits, the Court would deal with his costs at the hearing. As to the last defendant no case was mnade, and his costs would be costs in Mr. Cairns, Mr. Daniel, lr. Shapter, Mr. Shobbeare, Mr. Keene, and Mr. Hansard appeared in the case.

Judicc CROMPTON.) l The Court this day proceeded with the cases in the special paper. LEFEVsE v. MILLER. This case came before the Court upon demurrer. The action was in replevin, and the pleadings raised several questions upon the construction of the pablic Health Act, 1848. Mr. R. Clarke was heard for the plaintiff; and Mr. Bullar for the defendant. The argument occupieda large portion of the day, but the Court reserved their decision. M'TJRK V. THE LOOAL BOAHD Op HEALTHU AT nULL. In this case two questions were raised-first, whether an improvement rate made by the local Board of Health at Bull was a good rate- and secondly, supposiszit to be bad, whether, under the ciscamstances, the plaintiff could zecover the money back under the count for money had and received. The first question, the Court thought, hadalready; been determieed by a recent decision in the Court of E- I chequer, in which it had been held that the rate was bad. An attempt was made, by arrangement between the parties, ! to have the paper books transferred to the Court of Exchequer, so that the opinion of the other two Courts in Error mtight be tken upon the correctness of that decisioa. But, this negotiation having failed, the Court was subse quently in the day applied to to have the second point argued, and to give judgment thereon. Mr. MELLISH, on the part of the plaintiff, then contended that the money had been paid by the testator, whom toe plaintiffrepresented, under a mistake of the faets - and that, accordiDg to the cases, the party who so paid money was entitled to recover it back, though he could not do so where, with a knowledge of the facts, he paid the money under a mistake as to the law. Mlr. WRmRw, Q.C., who appeared for the Local Board, was stopped by Mr. Justice COLERIDGc, who said he had no doubt in this case. The plaintifs testator had been applied to by the local Board of Health to pay certain expenses that had been inacrred near his own door. He did nothing thereon, but when a second notice was given him he paid the monev His executor now sought to recover back the money. St was for him to show that the circumstances were such as would entitle him to recover it back. Now, it was not likely that a man would pay 601. or 701 wlthout examining; and At must be taken that he did know the facts, wrhice would render him liable. Othersocontestedthe matter, and would not pay, but the testator did pay, and not before he had inquired. Tho plaintiff had failed to show that he was entitled to recover back the money. Mr. Justice WIGsTMs Wag of the same opinion. The testator knew quite as much of the facts as the commissioners themselves did, and perhaps more. Judgment for the defendaunt THE PLATE GLASS UNVRSAL ASSURANCE COMPANY V. LUXLEY. This case came before the Court tpon a demurrer to the defendant's pleas. The action w.as brought by the Plate Glass Universal Assurance Company against the defendant, the holder of 2,000 shares, to recover the amlount of certin calls. The defendant pleaded a plea on equitable grounds, in which he alleged that he had alreadypaid 1,000 in respect of calls, that he was a director of the company, and it had been agreed between him and the other directors that he (the defendant) should retire from being a director, and should relinquish his shares to the company, and transfer 3isshares to the secretary in trust for the company; that the said agreement was executed by the defendant and ratified by the company, and that tbo calla now sued for were made npon him in fraud and breach of the said agreement. The defendant also pleaded that after making the said call4 the plaintiffs sold their business to another company, who agreed to take upon theraselves t'e plaintiffb' liabilities, and that by the said sale the plaintiffe claim was fully satisfied and discbarged. These pleas were both demurred to. lAr. Serjeant PIGoTr, in support of the demurrer to the first plea. rontended that this argunent set forth was ueZra vfre of th.e company, and w.a not binding wvithin tho 27th and 29th sections of the Joint-s ok Compoanioa Act {7th and 8thofVictoria, cap. fO), a-nd, asto tme aecoad plea, he oteDded It was DO answrer to the action.

Dr. Gardiner stated he pratised at Hastings. On the 11th of December, 1856, he wz called in to atend the plaintiff. He was then sufferinr from great prosetratoi of spirits, and complained of pain in the Bead, inability to bear the light, and nuambnes of the iight side.

It will be some time before he can recever, bat it is diffioult to form an opinion. He has recovered more rapidly than could bave been expected. Crose-examined.-le had heard the plaintiff examined, and was much surprised to find him able to undergo such an examination. To Lord CAmPrBLL.-As a medical man I must say I saw no deficiency of intellect or memory in him yestrday. Mr. Jones, surgeon, of the Wandsworth-road, was called in to attend the plaintiff the day after the accident ; he presented the symptoms of a concussion of the brain, but appeared to have got over the prostrate state. He recovered rapidly, and when he went to St. Leonard's he was perfectly fit to transact business. About the 29th of November he was much worse for a day or two, and was in such a state that he could not be allowed to see any person. Cross-examined,-To the best of his belief, when he last saw the plaintiff in the beginning of December he had completely recovered from the effects of the accident he spoke of what had occurred, snd authorized him to settle the affair with the company for 1001. and the expenses. In December the plaintiff was suffering from dyspepsia, and it was on that account that he advised him to go into the countrv. Mr. tHwiffs then prooeeded to sum up the evidenoc for the plaintiffi Kr. BovIn addressed thejury on behalf of the defendants. He contended that the sum of 500. already paid into court was more than aorple compensation for the injury sustained by the plaintiff. Lord CAsPxELL said that the case was one entirely for the consideration of the jury as to the amount of compensation. The jury found a verdict for the defendants. Lord CAMPBELL stated he entirely concurred in the fiLding. YROOM V. ASEDOWN AX) OTMERS. Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Prentice were counsel for theplair. tiff; Mr. Seijeant Hayes, Mr. Beasly, Ur. Gri'dits, and Mlr Wilkinson appeared for the various defendants. The plaintiff, Mr. C. P. Froom, is a solicitor in LMncoln's; inn-fields, and the defendants, Messrs. John Ashdown, Jobn Duff, Fancis M'Gedy, Thomas A. Young, and Kenneth R. Mackenzie,were the provisional directors of the Hungerford. ball Dining Company. The action was brought to recover the sum of 2001. which the plaintiff had advanced to the defendants in October last to enable them to tako certain premises for the purpose of the company. It appeared from the evidence of the plaintiff that the ocmpany had been projected ia the course of last year, and in September the plaintiffwas asked to become solicitor; he at first declineo, and eventually consented to act. Ir. Murray, a solicitor, was at that time in posesson of the p emises called Hungerford-hall which the directors were anxious to obtain for the purposes of the company. He asked 2001. for the fixtures and his interest. On the 20h of October a meeting of the board was held, attended by the defendants Ashdown, Mackenzie, and Young. It was then risolved that the plaintiff should be requested to advance -the sum of 2001, that he should be forthwith reimbursed out of the first moneys received by the company, and should hold the agreement with Mr. Murray as a collateral security. Lord CA2rpnBLL said that resolution rebutted the notion of a personal liability on the part of the defendants. The plaintiff agreed to look to the funds of the company. Mr. HAxwnxs said at that time the company ws not formed, and the resolution should be construed as a request on the part of the defendants to the plaintiff to advance the money. The examination of the plaintiff was then continued.- On the '7th of October another meeting was held, at which all the defendants were present, and the former resolution was confirmed; the money had been paid on the 22d, and the company was incorporated on the 31st. The defendants aro all shareholders and directors, each holding SO shares of 11., which had not been paid up. On cross-examination the plaintiff stated that he had been active in promoting the company. He saw Ashdown on the subject of becoming a dizector, and told him that the liability was limited, and that under the deed he would only bh li.ble to the amourt of his shares. He made the same statement to the defendant Yotug. Mr. Murray was his father-in-law. Before the agreement was signed with Mr. MNuray he told the defendants that they would incur no personal liability beyond the then payment. He did not say they would incur no personal responsibility whatever. Before signing the agreement they asked would they incur any responsibility by doing so. He told them not. The defen.- dant Mackenzie had acted as secretary to the company. It was Proved that only 381. lOs. had been paid to the credit of {he company with their banker. 38. had since been drawn out. The defendant, Mr. Ashdown, was called. He stated he had become a director at the request of the plaintiff, who told him he would incur no liability beyond the amount of his shares. Before the agreement was signed the plairtiff repeated they would incur no personal responsibility by doing so. He had not paid up on his shares. Lord CMAIPBXLL said he would direct a verdict for the defendants, with liberty to the plaintiff to move to enter it for hiEm. Verdict for the defendants.

He had fallen from the back seat of his dogcart, which was being driven by lr. Burdett. I found him in bel perf ectly sensible. His right eye was braised and his left wrist sprained, his knees con. tused, and generally shaken by the fall. His pulse at 70, low and feeble, and skin cold.

Saw him again on the Tuesday morning,when he was very restless, and complained of a sense of strangulation in the throat. While writing a prescription for himat the table in an adjoining apartment we heard a scream, and rushed into his bedroom, and found him in an epileptic fit, which Jasted two or three minutes. He had a second fit the santa morning. His pulso was 68. Saw him several times onthe WVednesday; his condition had changed entiroly. He hat then assumed aU the appearances of a person with diruin tremens. He had mllusions, which becamne delusions in the course of the day.

COURT OF EXCHEQUER, WEsTzANSTrB. 3im 24. NIXON V. GREEN. tti-tW98 at ZFisi Prim, before Mr. Baron MARTux and a SneciC; Jurv.) Mr. JsAwln James, Mr. Hodges, and Mr. Unthank were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill and Mr. Ogle appeared for the defendant. The plaintiff is a civil engineer, and this was a proceeding by way of sirefacias against the defendant as a share h. der of the Klikenny and Great Southern and Westein Railway Company, consequent upon a judgment against the company. The defendant denied that he was liable as a shareholder, and pleaded that the judgment in the action against the company had been obtained by fraud and collu. sion and with the view of making the. defendant liable as an aleged shareholder. The case occupied the whole of the day, the greater portion being consumed in the examination of parties connected writh the railwvay in question by the- defendant, for the purpose of establishing the plea of fraud. The matt4rs disussed were not such as to call for a detailed report, and it may suffice to say that the cause eventuated in a vordict for the plaintiff, sabject to a biUl of exceptions.
EXCHEQUER CrrAmRp *T 9X- 1 MANSELL V. THE oTT0Rm (Siings in Error.-Present, Lord C'hief Justice COCRKBN. Justics WILLLms and WiLLEs, and Barons BA&WVELL, WATSON, and CHANNXL.) hMr. WEIdnY (with whom was Mr. Ribton) commenced his argument this morning on behalf of the prosecution in answer to the arguments of Mr. F. RusselL He would confine himself strictly to the legal question. There was a difficulty at the root of his friend's argument, whether there sppeared on the record auch a judgment that a, writ of error could be founded upon it. Lord Tenterdea said when a challenge was made a party might demur, and then there was a trial upon the cause assigned. The Cnjx JusTicx.-The objection was that the Crown was no' compelled at once to assign cause. Mr. WELSBY said it mnst be stated on the record and issue joined, The improper disalowance of a chaUenge was, no doubt, a matter of error. All that appeared now was that the Crown claimed to challenge a man. The prisoner's counsel objected to that, without cause shown; that was a case for demurer. The CHIEF Ju.cB.-The Crown merely gave notice of challenge-that at the proper time it would challenge for cause. Mr. WgLSBy.-There must be such a challenge that there might be an issue. A judge might misdirect a jury in point of law upon a criminal case, but upon that there was no error, for a biU of exceptions did not lie in a criminal case, and it did not appear on the record. A jodge might even corruptly postpone a trial, but that would not appear upon the record, and error would not lie. Here the Crown said let such a juror be put aside; the prisoner objected, but the judgo directed it; that was not a challenge, and error could not be brought. Error must be founded upon a judgment. Here there was no judgment; the matter of chalenge was adjonrned. Even upon the allowance of a cbaUenge which appeared upon the record he did not think there could be error. A man had no right to be tried by a particular jury. The CHEF JusnC-The Crown had not the same power of peremptory challenge which the prisoner had, and if the Crown failed in showing cause the prisoner had a right to have that man upoa the jury. A jury must not be packed. Mfr. WELSBY.-It was only after the panel had been gone through that the Crown was put to show cause upon its cnallenges. When was it that the panel was gone through ? ,bs iend said itwas when the available jaror, had been called. He apprehended it was not so, but it was when the panel waa exhausted, and that, without showlng cause, the trial could not proceed. There were several courts; all the panel was called. whenthe judge directed the: other court to ie sent to for other jurors; could it Se said the panel was gone through? Or, suppose a train to be lat4 and a hostof jurors rushed inxater all the names ha&been called, could it be said the panel had been perused or exhausted, when plenty of jurors had arrived before catuB was shown? A7 m n was not a defaulter if he was in time to be sworn. The judge would.have been guilty of a great error if he had iafused to have any of the 12 jurors oalled who came in beDore cause was shown. Lord Holt had said cause was not to be shown until all the panel hld been gone tbrough. After the panel was gone througb, in order that an inquest might not rmain anhaken, cause must be shown, net that the mere persora in court had been called, but the whole and entire panel an~st be gone througb. In Horme Too!e's case the panel wascalled; though many jurors were excused others were challenged; all had been called, and the judge directed the defaultera o he called, and then the ,challenges Were waived, so that the panel had been-com- -letely gone through before the Attorney-General was put to show cause The inquiry upon cause was rot to be goca into until the panel had been exhausted. When the panel had been gone through and the names were began to be called again, and cause ws entered upon as to one, and that one was sworn, then, although others came in, that ono mnan must not be set asde. The CHx JusTIC&.-According to Horne Tooke's care the defaulters were ordered to be called, and if these 12 men who had composed tho other jury, and who had not answered before, came into court, they might have been IcaUled and sworn before cause was shown. Mr. WELSBY.-The dividing point was the swearing. If Ironmonger had been sworn, no objection could then have been made to him. No authority showed that the panel was exhausted at the time Ironmonger's name was called a second time. The order to stand by meant after the panel had been gone through, and, if necewsary. the Crown would be called upon to show cause. A writ of error could not be brought upon the raode of caUing the jury; it was entirely a matter of practice. The officer was not bound to call them in their order; it was matter of practice and discretion, and no writ of error would lie with regard to it; it was perfectly immateriaL The CrsEr JUSriC~.-In this ease the jury were regularly called with the exce tion of the 12 men who were known to be looked up. fVhen they came in theirnames were called. Mr. WELsBy.-Ail the people were called in their order who were to be called. The law was, that a man should have a good and proper jury out of the panel; the prisoner haL no right to a particular order of caUing. The CHE Jusmrc.-Supposing names to be called out of their order purposely because those jurors were known to be adverse to the prisoner, was there no redress ? He was not speaking of this particular case, but as to the principle. Baron BRBAwnnLL.-The prisoner had a right to have them caUed indifferently, otherwise the prisoner's rights would be violated, but still error would not lie. Mr. WBISBY.-There was no writ of error upon that calling. Here the jury were called in the order in which they were in the paneL The conversation between the judge andPhillpotts was immaterial, because Philipotts was challenged. The CESEF Jus=aE said a case had occurred to his mind of a man not being objeoted to, but, upon his being about to be sworn, saying, "I don't believe in the efficacy of an oath ;" what would be the duty of a judge9 3Ir. WBLSBY said, in Palmer's case a man said he had formed an opinion, and could not try impartially. Ldrd Campbell ordered him not to be sworn. The coumsel were very fearful that many others might follow so laudable an example, but fortunately they did no,;. This was not a judgment, however, upon which a writ of error could ba brought. There was no doubt that these were good and lawful mnen of the county of Rent, although in making up the record they were not so stated to be. Baron BRsAXvELL.-Supposing one vas not a good and lawful man, which he presumed meant that he had not the qualiication, not that he was a wicked man, what then ? The prisoner mght challenge; if he did not, what then? Mr. WBLSBY said there could not be error upon it. There was, first, a precept to summon good and lawful men of lKent; then there was a mandate as regarded each prisoner, that upon the trial there should be 12 of such good and lawful men. Mr. F. RuSSra. (with whom was Mr. Denman) then replied. If error was not allowed for grievances of whioa a pnsoner had a right to complain, what redress had he? There was no remedy. If there was a defect in the proceedings be submitted there might be error. The smallest defect in an indictment would be ground of error. The CE[F JusTrrx-That would appear upon the record; it must appear properly upon the record. Mr. RuSsZLL.-If put upon the record it was ground of error. It some jurors took a view, and it did not state how many, that was error. If a man was not tried by aury accordin to that which he had a right to, wrong wasdon him. Itthe jury were improperly elected it was error, and the judgment ought to bo reversed. The learned counsel then bnefly replied upon the other points of the case, and ultimately submitted that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench must be reversed, for that Court had not Laid down any rule. Troublesome times might come again;trials might take place for politica!t offences, and small indeed would be the hope for any person charged if this jud,gment were allowed to stand. The ICourt, having adjourned for a short time, again The CmrF JUSTICn then delivered his judgment. He wasofopinionthat the judgment of the Queen's Bench must be affirmed. He should not advert to the law, because he was of opinion that the judgment ought to bs affirmed upon the merits. The first objection as to the proceeding at the trial was, that after the list of the jury had been gone through and the names called certain persons who bad answered to their names had been challenged by the Crown, and that after this had been done certain per. sons, to the number of 12, whose names had been passed over because they were at that time in the keeping of the sheriff, serving on another trial, came into court, and the narme of Ironmonger, one of the persons challenged by the Crown, was called again with a view to his eligibility being determined upon. Instead of disposing of Ironmonger's case, the learned judge allowed the names of the jury who had returned into court to be called over, and such persons to be put upon the jury before Ironmonger's case vas disposed of, The question turned upon the statute of 6th George rV., which repeiled, though in substance it re-enacted, the earlier statute of 33d of Edward L relating to juries. It appeared that prior to Edward L the Crown had, either in the legal exercise of its prerogative or by usurpation, exercised, the power of chalenging peremp. torily, without any limit as to the number of ohal. lenges. The 33d of Edward I. retained that power by pro. viding that the Crown should not have the power of chal. lenging except upon showing cause. It appeared that in. stead of showing cause at the time the Crown merely inti mated its intention to challenge, and the juror was put on one side until the whole panel was gone through. It seemed to be admitted upon the authorities that when the Crown challenged the' practice wa3 to order the juror to stand aside until it was seen whether out of the rest of the panel a sufficient number of jurors could be found to constitute the jury, and it was not until the panel was gone through that the Crown could be called upon to show cause. That being conceded, the whole question resolved itself Into thi,when was the panel to be considered as gone through or perused? Did that mean simply when the names f -the panel were called over, or did it mean when every proper and legitimate attempt and effort had been made to acertain whether the names of aU the persons who Were' liable to serve had bee caled. The list had once-been gone through, the nas;es had been called, jurors had been challenged and put on one side until the rest of the panel had been gone through, when, during a discussion as to cause being shown, and while the question was pending, the ab3ent jorors came into court. They had been unch'lleuned, and therefore might properly be put upon the jury. T)he ractie as to catling the names differed in some placw, ut in this case they were called in their order. It being conceded that the Crown was not bound to show cause till the panel had been gone through, it appeared to him that so far as these 12 were concerned the pauel had not been gone through till their names had been called over, It wag said that the judge was wrong in ordering that Ironmon er must stand by. He thought they must look at the whole of the case, and see what was meant by " standing by." It occuxred' in the statute paed with referenoe to this matter. It meant this, that the Crown having challenged a paricular juror, and having thought it right to postpone stating. the cause ofchallenge until the panel had been gone throuo, the uror was directed by the judge to stand on one side untl the proper time should come for the cause of challenge to be stated. As to the calling the jurytbere was no rule *f With regard to Philpotts, it appeared that be nrad beenpassed on both sides without challenge, and it was therefore said that he ought to have taken his giace and been sworn. It must be borne in mind that a rty could challenge until the juror came to the book to besworn; it was common to both partles, and not the pri. vilege of one. He for one would not assent to the doctrine that if a judge knew of an reason be might not cause him to be removed. In the preseht case the learned judge did not of his own mere notiondirectthejury to withdraw, butupon the juror stating he was conscous he could not discharge his duty the counsel for the Crown chalenged him, and the learned udge most properl acquiesced in his standing by. It was astly said that the record was imperfect, because it did not appear that the jurors were good and lawful men- of the county of ent. It w.as to be observed that it was open to the prisoner to challenge them. After verdict they must suppose that the sheriff, who was directed to return good and lawful men for the purpose of the trial-they must suppose the sheriff did his duty. He thought there was nothing in the objections to prevent the judgment of the Court below beng sustained. The judgment oftbhe Court of Queen's Bench must be afflrmed. The other JUDGES gave similar opinions, complimenting the learned counsel for the asinstance he had rendered the Court by his research, and for the ability with which be had arped the case. Baron WA-ON expressed himself very strongly upon the fact of the judge himself, for sufficient reasons, dllowimg a person to serve, It would be painful indeed for a judge. to sit in solemn mockery upon a trial when he knew an im. partial verdict would not ho given. Mr. WErsBY asked the Court to award execution. The CHrs JusTiCE sad they affirmed the judgment of the Queen's Bench, which had awarded execution. Mr. WELSBY said that time had gone by. Mr. Justice WILLEs said, execution had been respitede at the expiration of the respite execution would take place. Judgment affirmed, any further application to be made to this Court on the Idi of July.

COUBR of BANKRUPTCY, Banng7A-ug, J.7une 24- IN RE 1TH 11OYAL BrnIm, B tWA7 (Bfore3Ar. ConmMiuionr HoIuoYD.1 This was a meeting to receiva the accounts of the direolors of the bank and pass their last examination. The directors upon whom has been Imposed the obligation of preparing tbe accounts duly surrendered, with the exception of Mr. Gillott (who is suffering from illness, and whose abence noas exoused on that ground). Mr. Alderman Kennedy and Mr. aladeod, two of the directors, came Into the open Court, Mr. Linklater appeared for the assignees; Mr. Huddle. ston appeared for Mr. Stapleton; Mr. Marsden for Mr. Alderman Kennedy; Mir. Mason for Mr. Gillott- Mr. Hurt, Mr. Butt, and Mr. Venning for Mr. Esle; Mr. Bagley appeared on behalf of Mr. Myers, architect, in snpport of a proof for 6,8551., the consideration of which, aftersome discuasion, was ordered to stand adjonred to the 18th of September., Mr. LuTER.-Your Honour was pleased to appoint to-day as the sitting for the examination of the directors of the bank-in fact, for their passing their last examination. The last sitting took place on the 17th of April, .uad It was then represented by the accountant, Mr. Coleman, who had been appointed by some of the directors to preparea the balance-sheet (Mr. Cooper having been appointed to prepare the balance-sheet for the three directors who came into office very shortly before the failure of the bank), that it would certainly be filed within 10 days or a fortnight from that time. The adjournment was taken for rather more than two months, in order that there might be no further expense incurred, and in order that the whole matter might be concluded, and that the business of the estate, as far as possible, might be brought to a close. We are here on the 24th of June, and there has been no balanco-sheet filed-nor, indeed, is lt further advanced than it was on the 17th of April. It will therefore be for the directors each of them to explain to the Court why they have not faulfilled their obligation. The time has been ample; they have all of them had abundan' opportunity, as it seems to me, of examining the. balance sheet, and I do not understand why it has not been filed. I find that the learned counsel, Mr. Huddleston, whom we have the pleasure of seeing here to-day, represents one gentleman, Mr. Stapleton and the others, I believe, are represented, and it will be for them to give explanations of their present default. Mr. HuDDLEsTo*.-Sir, I appear here for Mr. Stapleton, and I think that the Coart will feel that Mr, Stapleton ought not to be called upon in the Present state of affairs to file his balance-sheet. Your honour is aware that a prosecution is how pending against Mr. Stapleton, and the other gentlemen connected with the Royal Britlsh Bank. It is quite obvious that during those proceedings It would be extremely unfair and very prejudicial to the interests of these persons who are charged with an offence of this description, if t6ey are to be called upon to prodce accounts to which they would be oblged to swear, and which would no doubt at some future perioa be used ia evidenco against them. Now, with reference to the reason why Mr. Stapleton is not in a condition, or has not filed his balancesheeL You are aware that when an order was made for Mir. Stapleton and the other directors to file their balance-sheet an arrangement was made that Mr. Stapleton, in conjunction with some other of his co-directors-Mr. Rsdaile, Mr. Alderman Kennedy, Mr. Valiant, and Mr. A'Leod-sbould prepare a joint balance-sheet. Mir. Gillott, Mr. Hurst, and Mr. Batt were to prepare a separate balance-sheet, bat of course it woaldrequire thejointattention and assistance ofaaU those gentlemen; andalthoughthe matter was placed-and placed,Ibelieve, attheirpr5vateexpense-inthehandsoEMr. Coleman, the balance-sheet requires the greatest care and circumspection before it should be laid before this Court and be sworn to by the parties. It would be exceedingly hazardous for Mr. Stapleton to swear to the balance-sheet unless he has had an Opportunity of personally examining it and going through it. Now Mr. Stapleton has not, as I said Mefore, had the assistnce of those gentlemen wIth whom it vas originally intended he should make out this account. Circumstances have occurred which have rendered it desirable on the part of those gentlemen to avail themadves of the facilities of railway travelling, and to be dispersed on the continent. Mr. Stapleton has been the onlyperson who has remained In in2gland. Under these circumstances he feels it quite impossible to furnish this Court with a balance-sheet by which afterwards he may be bound, and to which the Act of Parliament requires him to be sworn. We know perfectly weU that the result of filing the accounts upon oath would be that they would belaid before the jury upon a future occasion for the purpose of dispensing with that evidence upon which alone any person ought to be tried in this country. There may be another reason which I shall venture to put before you, and to ask you that this matter may, in fairness and in justice. to this gentleman, be adjourned sine dfe. They have quite sufficient to do at the present moment to prepare themselves for that trial upon which the are about to appear, and I thik you would scarcely deem it reasonable to require them to furnish this account to the detriment of their own interests and for the purpose of being used against them. I am surett Mr. Liiiklter, who appears for the prosecution, will be as desirous as you who have felt it to be your duty to put this matter in a train of inquiry, that it shall not appear to the publc, that there ia.a desie abroad to press unfairly against these gentlemen, but that they shall be entitled to that which every one is supposed to enjoy in this country-a fair,impartial, and unprejudiced trial; but that cannot be attained if these proceedings are to bs precipitated, and r am qate esre you wilu feel that justice to these gentlemen, who are placed in a most disadvantageous pos'tion, can only be effgce by granting an adjournment of this last examination sine die, or at all events untilaft r the tri with which they are tbreatened, and that justice to the creditors will be satisfied by that course being taken. Mr. IfNKLATXR.-Sir, it may, perhaps, be conventent that I should answer one or two of the observations of the leanied counsel, and then wq shall lhear what the other directors have to say for themselves. I do not quite nuderstand from the learned counsel whhat he means. He at first sys he propose not-to file a balance-sheet, because it may Wssibl prejudice his client upon the approachiug 2 ten ienters into a very learned and somewhat lengthy statement for the purpose of convincing the Court that the opportunities v;hich his client has enjoyed, in consequence of the absence of information from others, have not been such as to have enabled him to file sauch a balance-sheet ae would satisfy the Cout If the learned counsel had. said, "I intend to file a balance-sheeYt then there would have been no necessity for his obsertions with referencetQ the approaching trials. On thie other hand, if he says, "I do not intend to file a balance-sheet," thiea it is utterly nnnecessary for any observations with reference to the difficulty with which he considers Mfr. Stapleton surrounded. Tb rels not a criminalbankrupt who has been placedat the baro the Old Bailey from whoselips thevery same argument colidnot have been well addressed to the Court, if the observations of the learned counsel have any weight or force whatever. Every bankrupt charged with having defrauded his creditors would, accordmng to the learned counsel, have a right to-say to the Court, "Withhold the order for filing my balanoesheet. Permit me to withhold all iaformation from the assignees and from my creditors, because, forsooth, the criminal law of the country has been put in motion with a view to my puni .hment." The COars,SSroN1E.-I do not think that I ought to trouble you Upon that part of the case. I must deal with the law as it is, and as that law requires every bankrupt to file his balance-sheet Mfr. Stapleton must do it. Mr. LINxLAThn.-Then, with reference to the other observations of the learned counsel, he says Mr. Stapleton has not had the assistauce of those gentlemen wrho have found it convenient to seek other climates for the benefit of their health. Mr. Stapleton was under no snch necessity because he has a seat in another place, and is therefore free from that personal molestation to which unfortunately ordinary subjects are liable If I understand the learned counselPs client to say " I will file my balnne. sheet; I rwiU do all I can to give the most perfect information in my power to the Court,"-l should be content by assenting on the pert of the assiguses to any reasonable ad. jourument with that obect. With reference to the use that may be made of the balance-sheet when filed, I am not in a position to state wvhat may be done; but I knowr that the Attorney-General has at p resent intimated that where per.sona are under a charge of crimie they should not after criminal proceedings have been taken, be examined upon the stubject of the charge. What may be done with the examinations w,hich have already taken place it is not for me nowv to refer to ; whether the course adopted. by the law offioers of the Crown with reference to the balancesheet would be the saime as that which holds in the mind of the Athtoney-General with reference to futuire examinatiena I do not know. This I certainly do knowv, that the prosecution will be conducoted with the utmost fairness; and if any of the directors woho are the subject of the prosecution can prove their innocence to the jury, no cue would be more glad to receive the evdence of their innocnce annd the estblishment of that fact than those who have instituted these prosecutions. It happens that the trial will not take-place until December; and there will be abundant opportunity for the partiesi to get up their defence. There till of course, be the samle opportunity afforded for the prosecution. If there be any pre3dice existing at the present moment in the public mind there will be aibundant tixMe for that to subsice, so that these gentlemen may receive Shao leliverano from the jury as the merits or demerits of their ce may de. serve. I must ask that Mr. Stapleton be placed iastuch a po. sition aswill enableusto compel him to do that which, in jus tice to the creditors, who have: been wronged by the failure of this bank, he ought to do, With reference to the 5uggestion made by the learned counsel for adjourning the examination aine die, I must protest against that course. I have no objection to some adjoaunuent for a limited period, because I shall tlien have power to enforce the attendance of Mr. Stapletoh hetre.. Mr. Stapleton will. abeent himself at the peril of being liable to that outlawry which will follow his absence at the time appointed for the last examination. By that time I shall have had the opportunity of considering what oourse to puraneif Mr. Stapleton should prove contumacios and resist the order of the Court. The learned Counsel again urged the Coart not to require the balance-sheet to be iled. Mr.Lnum,&TEt said,-The rsore strenuous the opposition is to filing the accounts the more pressing is the necessity for requiring it. The ComssIoNZR.-It appears to me that 1 must in this case take the same course that would be taken in any otber bankruptcy. I mast require the balance-sheet to be filedl in the same way as any other bankrutpt is required to file his balane-sheet, and any person who does not oedoly with that order must be subject to tho 'sme. oaaquqte a any other bankrpt. The Attorney.GenerlIwiIeq*cime his own discretion as to using any examninations. Ygq ar# auing this Court to add what the AItorney-Gea is going to do, and you aro asming that he wi mAke of the examinations, and therefore that teCut~ol nct allow the balance-sheet to be filed, but I thina k=d to vlew the case independently of any prooFedins elsewhere. If t I wre another eue I am not sure that a more serious application m4ht not be msde - becaue Mr. Stapleton, although he sys he ha not hadthe assisance of other gentlemen, doe not show that he has endeavouaed to satisfy himself a to the truth of the belanoe-sheet. Mr. IdASOM, on the puat of Reoo Gillott, Batt, and Hurst, said that they were moat desirou that their balance. aheet shouia be on the file of the oourt as soon as it could be prepared. Mr. Cooper, the acouLntnt, whom they ad instracted in the matter, wak desrous that the balance. sheet should be as complete as possible, and he had been devoting great personal labour, timei and trouble to show the Court whstwas the state of the uk at the time those gentlemen took their seats as directors. Mr. MAIsSDXN, for Mr. Alderman xennedy, said he had cestaily been on the continent, not for the puroose of avoiding bis fair contribution to the bank, but to aioid the creditors. He wras a very old man, nearly 70 years of age, his health was shattered, and it was quite impossible for him to go into thene figures pending the present proeecu. tion. He snould ask, therefore, on behalf . derman Kennedy for an adjournment until after the tria Mr. VXsNNo, on the part of Mr. Edaile, made a similar application. Mr. InLATEzR.-Your Honour ha alroRdy disposed of that objection. With referenc, to the use that i o be made of the extminations opinions maydiffer, and I believe men with very wise heads have come to opposite conclusions upon that gubject. The Com sIiOxu.-Th.js point has very recently been dicse beo e-tejudges of the superyoer ycourts and alln the ,judges, witth the exeeption of one, are deodedly of opunion that these examinations not only are admissible in evidence, but I think they have also gone furfther, and said that they do not see anyreauon why the law should not have Mr. HUDDLmTON.-No doubt there has been a decison to the effect that these examinations are admissible. The ComiION5L-Two cae havo recently occurred upon the subject. I muAsot upon the law as it is, and as it hae been decided. Mr. LuTSL&TzP-And it is to be hoped as it will continue. The ComrsneSIoNma-I canot act in anticipation of a law which may or may notUtke effect. With regard to this not ein lie a on. nrueptcy. there is this to be s .-the reason whye dIr have not the same pro. tection as an ordina banrlupt is this, that they are niot mado bmkrnpt in their individual capacity, but they are made bankrupt only in their corporate capacity, therefore the legislature has thought it quite enouigh to give these drctors who are ordered to prepare the blanoe-shest proteton in coming to tAe court, and so on, but not to protect them from arrest for debt,-that is, for an iindividual liability when in their individual capacity they are not uade ba'krupt. Ater some fArther dlscussion, TheCCoxso msr saia,-Let the last journment stand lil the 23d of September, and let the balance-sheet be filed on the 1st of September ; that will give three woeks to, the nees to exi mine it. V . &L- t wil be sulffieent. Mfr. ImmrATz'E then said,-I should state sa au additional reason for consenting to the adjournment of Mr. Gillott'g eamination that he is not one of those included in either of the informations which have been filed by tho Attorney-General. There are 10 defendants in those in. formations 2 and although they were onl filed, the first on the 3d,tie second on the 8th, and the third on the 9th of this month, I am happy to say that all the parties who are defendants,withthe exoeption of one, have been secured, and some have been releasd on baiL There is but one exception,thatexoeption, Iarhappytosay, isnotUr.Camemn. Thetelegraphio mcesowhich I hold inmyhandannounoes that at this moment Mr. Cameron Is leaving the shores ef France and will be incustod in England ths evening. It Is right also to state-for this is the only opportunity one has of making communications to tho creditors-that it is utterly inoorrect to suppose tht one shilling of the expense of these prosecutions Iw come out of the estate. The pockets of the creditors will net suffer one shilling for any. thing that is done with regard to the prosocutions. They are prosecntions Instituted bi the State and conducted, of course, at the expense of the Tsersary. Then, Sir, I have also to ask your Honour to fix tho same day for a furthtr dividend that has beenappointedforthelastexamination of the directors.. I was in great hope that circumstauo43 would have enabled us to reAlize the oitatuding assets so fully that we might very easily have declared s dividend at the end of the prewnat month, or at allU events during Jul' The delay ia the disposa%lof the Welsh mine han other cit cumstances :have rendered Itnesarsotpotil thefurtherdividend, becauae, although the ass to have handsuficent to pa therdividendof s. in the pouna the expenso of dechring the dividend and its payment, having regard to the number of creditors, is very consider. able; it is, therefore consideredldesirable to avoid that ep pense, and to dely for a period of some weels, the declar6tion of what may then probably be mrade final dividend, I cannot hold out anyprospect of there being more than IO in the pound from the estate, unless some,of the outstanding assts should be realized more favourably than is anticipated, That bas been tho saitement made from tOhebgining the assignees. l t a*later hour in the day Information was received that 3£r.

The aCx COMISSIONZA, In pronouncing the adjudi cation, reviewed the chief facU in the case. The insolven he said, described himself as an imnporter of foreign good' which description was st#ctly correct, but, although it WA certain that goadsl were imported by him, it was not at a1 dea ho w he had disposed of them. Teinsolvent during. bis residenoc in England had received from abroad goods. of the value of 1,5wl., on account of which he had not pai one farthing. He had dealt in al1 kinds of articlet,-c. rIs,j werY.,vermiceUi, braudy,pa firerms,pianofo -andhadcontinuedtorecelve consignments even fter his bills had beendishonoured aud he was beingnedupon theis It appared tht,h g been a commercial traveller in the Sou of srauce and 8paID, he came to England inile winter of 1855. Early in the following year he opened an offioe ia Exeter 'Change, and his transActions extended ovjr the period between April and October last, during whidh time he had received merchandise to the extent of 1,5001. in value. Headmitted to havlng received about 300. or 4u01. in cash for those goods, and accounted for the deficiency by referring to the list of debtors in his schedule, being persons to whom be-sold good, bnt who had failed to my him. The statements were extremely unsatisFactory, and none of the parties could now be found, one of them, a. friend of the insolvent, named Rigueras8, to wiom he had intrusted pro- erty to the valne Of nearly 401, having gone to Buenos A-yres The opinion of the Court was that the insolvent had fra;udulently made saway w-ith property for wshieb offence his discharge would be delayed until the cxpiration of 16 calendar months froma the date of the vesting order. IN RE WILITA. GEORGR HOWARD. The insolvent, the presumptive heir to the earldom of Wieldow, applied to be discharged. Mr. 3'0abrey appeared for a ereditor named Gray; Mr. Abrahams, an attorney, opposed; and Mr. Sargo, with Mr. Reed, supported. The insolvent was arrested on the 26th of Febrmary, 1853 and has remained in the Qaeen's Prison from that date until now. A ve^ting order had been obtained upon a creditor's petition, whereupon the present schedule has beon filed. That document states the aggregate amount of debts to be 179,115M, of which 136,3001. are debts for which no oonsideration has been received, 15,0001. are twice entered, and the debts for consideration are 27,8151. The property to meet these claims are 2,600& debts and the expectancies on sucoeeding to the Wicklow eernge. The came occupied the whole day, but, as the inquiry oonducted by 3fr. Abrahams was in the natnre of an audit of claims, any detailed aoconnt of the proceedings would be wholy uninterestin to the public. The chief point of inquw as into the nature of the consideration gven byHr 2E. Clark for three post-obit bonds, which had been executed by the insolvent to secure payment of 33,0001. Oae bond for 15,000l. was given, it appeared, in payment for lease and farniture of Vere-lodge, Brompton, which was valued at 3,0001. Another bond to secure 16,0001., a penal sum intended to cover a claim of 8.u000., appeared to have been given for the purchase of eight racehorses (wretched screws, which fetched nothing at Tatersal's, according to the insolvent's evidence), and of a valuable dresdng-case, and for the settlement of various pecuniary trauseations between the isolvent and Mr. Clark. The third post.obit bond for 2,0001. was given to cover 5001, the purchase-money for two racehorses called Glenhawk and Glendower. In each case an actuary had calculated the amount which ought to be given for deferred payment upon the contingency of the insolvent suceceeding to the Wicklow peerage adestates, and that amount being assumned to be five times the original debt the bonds were given upon that calcula- Mr. Clark and other witnesses were examined, but at the close of the day the inquiry was unfinished, and was ad. journed untl Saturday. Mr. A33RAAM disclaimed all desire to prolong the insolvent's confinement, and declared that his object was to ob. tain Information which would enable the assigneo to dispute the enormous demands which would be made upon the e-statie, Mr. SARGOOD, for the insolvent, expressed his unwillingneo that Mr. Abrahams should be appointed assignee, and ought the inquiry which that gentleman was makng might well be postponed until a future occasion. W.

Mr. Stuehbury, .asz the office of the City Solicitor, toppeared for the -prmecution; Mr. Buchanan attended for two persons in orle & the batches placed before the Aldermnan. Al the o h. prisoners wereundefended. Robert Collyer,-lohn Vickary, Arthur Ugal, and Edward 'Woodhead werelhe first persons chaged. Inspe£or Howard said, the defendants were taken into 'custody by snerand my assistants upon this warrant. About 12 O'clock to-day I went tothe Kings Ares inBishopsgatestrebt, a&ian'the parlour on the ground floor I found the four dWfendants. Collyer was pointed out to me as "Vic'kary, but he said his name was Collyer. I was then 'told whisk was Vickary. I produced my warrant. On CollyerI found 251.7s. 6d. He said he had nothing elseabout tUn but ;n handkerchief, but I found upon him a bettingbook and several papers relating to horse races, and a card relating to races. Baker,6 35.-I accompanied the inspector, and 'found the fonr ddeendants there. I searched Vickary, and foundupon him 3SU. 15s. ld. Upon the two other defendants were found some papers relating to betting transactions. J. Butt, house-agent, said,-On Wednesday, the 10th 'inst., I went, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, to the Ring's Arms, in Bishopsgate-street, and in the parlour on the ground floor I saw four or five persons, among whom was Collyer, who represented himself tome as Viokary. He laid me 41. to lOs. against Flacrow on a race to come off at Ascot. I gave him a sovereign and he gave me four half*crowns in exchange. He told me 'his name was Vickary, and he asked me my name to enter the bet. I gave him the name of Butler. The card of the race was lying on the table. He made an entry in his book. I had been to the same place a week or 10 days previously, and I saw CoUyer and others there then, and I saw him lay a et of 201. to 41. npon a horse, and the person made another bet with him and paid him money on both bets. I have been on two or three otheroccasions there and seen Collyer on each occasion. Cross-examsined by Mr. Buchanan.-I have been accus. tomed to betting. I asked Collyer what he was laying against a certain horse, and he said 8 to 1, and I said I would take it for half-a-sovereign. Johnson, 134, gave confirmatory evidence asto frequent betting transactions by Collyer. Mr. Buchanan submitted that the evidence was not sufficiently strong against Collyer as to the alleged fact of the betting to authorize a conviction. Alderman WIRIC-There have been five distinct cases proved against Collyer, who has been a common frequenter of the place for the purposes charged in the warrant. I do not consider the cases proved sufficiently against the other three, and I shal discbarge them, with a marked caution as to their future visits to places of the kind. With respect to Collyer, my brother magistrates and I have come to the determination to inflict heavy penalties in all cases of the kind. We have observed the dangerous effect produced by persons who encourage this sort of gambling, that numerous robberies have sprung from the encouragement given to young porsons to appropriate the money of their employers to betting purposes, and that the praotice increases in the qcity of London. We shall try our strength and activity in checking so pernicious a vice, and I begin with Collyer by fining him 251. and costs. The next batoh of defendants brought before the magistrate consisted of Edward Thomas, H. Jones, EL Jacobs, R. Robinson, W. King, R. Stile, and T. Newooombe. Inspector Shelford, assisted by his men, took the defend3nts into custody in the Panch Tavern, 99, Fleet-street. Newcombe, it was proved, was the person who took the bets. He had about him between 3001. and 4001. in cash and checks, and several betting papers were found in his possession. He said he was in the habit of betting as gentlemaen betted at Tattersall's, and he took the same odds. Aldernman WIRE fined Newcombe 251. and costs, and discharged the other defendants of this batch after an admon Ii'ion. The third batch consisted of Henry Osmond, aeufes Harris, B. Noon, W. Andrew, J. Taplin, J. Burrell, and T. Bowen. Inspector Scott,aided by his men,took the defendants into custody on the second floor of a beershop at No. 10, Talbot. court. Osmond was the principal character, and he had in his possession between 501. and 601. and several papers relating to races. The ALDERMANc fined Osmond 251. and costs, and discharged the other defendants. The cases were not concladed till near 9 o'clock. G(UILDLUALL.-Charles Harrison, a foreman in the employ of Messrs. Cooper, wholesale grocers, of Monument-yard, was placed at the bar before Alderman HALE, charged with robbing his employers of goods *to a considerable amount, and ERoger Darant and Ryder Darant, wholesale grocers and dealers imspie, of Lillypot-lane, were charged with feloniously receiving the property, knowing it to have been stolen. Mr. Hnmphreys appeared for the prosecution Mr. Sleigh attended for the two Durants; hlr. Wontner for the prisoner Harrison. It ' ill be recoUected that Harrison, from the position he held in the prosecutors' establishment, was allowed to draw orders upon the refiners for sugar-loaves to supply the warehouses, and that he had directed 40 loaves of sugar to be taken from the refiner's to the premises of Roger Durant, instead of plaoing them in stock. Evidence to this fact was given by Mr. Mossop, the refiner's managing man, and that witness was now recalled. Mr. Mossop said, when he first went to Chamberlaine'swharf to examine some sugar sent there by Mr. Darant, he did not inspect aU the titlers, but on Taesday he went again and examined the remainder. They were enclosed in wbite paper, with a blue paper outside. He found the initial letters ' R. A. T." marked on the white paper of 18 in his handwvriting, two were not marked at all, and the rest were in the handwriting of some other person. The weightnote produced, dated the 26th of May, referred to the de. livery of two parcels, of 50 titlers each, to Messrs. Cooper but there had been a line added since, referring to 46 titlers, and that line was not in his handwriting, neither had it been written with his authority. Mr. Humphreys explained that the witness had given a vweight-note with 40 titlers which had found their way into Dnrant posse=sion to Harrison, and that note had been suppressed; bat to account for the number of loaves deliverable, this item of 40 titlers had been added to a preceding weight-note of goods delivered actually to Messrs. Cooper for the ordinary purposes of their business. WVitness further st3ted that he had examined the bottoms of all the titlers, and found no marks on them. They up. peared to have been rubbed or scraped. Henry Blutch, a porter in the employ of Messrs. Durant, was then recalled, and said, he recollected coming to the office one morning and finding Ryder Duraut there during the time the titlers were there. Ryder Darant said they were ready for hini to put the blue papers on some of them, uad he did so. Some of the strings were off, and Ryder Durant said he had taken the dust and chips away, but he (witness) did not pay sufficient attention to his conversation to recol1act anything further. Ryder Durant directed him to put the initials "R. A. T." upon the blue papers, and he did so. He recollected hearing Ryder Durant say something about not being able to swear to the goods, but lie did not remernber the exact time. The words used were, " They cannot swear to them now." Harrison called to see Mr. Darant on the 29th of May, and upon being asked which of the Duranits he wanted, ho said either would do, bat he would rather see Roger Durant. * Mr. Eiumphreys, after soene discussion, applied for a fuyther re,niand, when he said he should be in a position to offer such incoutestable evidence of the prisoners' guilt as would justify hiru in asking for a committal on a future day. dIr. Sleigh asked that the Durants might be admitted to bail; as they had attended voluntarily to give evidence, and were given into custody. Men were presumed to be ininocent until found guilty, and, as he had a full and complete answer to this charge, he confidently expected that it they were sent for trial a jury would send them back into the vorld without a stain upon their character. The Alderman would understand that they could better prepa; e for their defence if they were at large, and they were prepared with sach surties as would insure their appearaice. Mr. Woutner said, it did not appear to him that any case of stealing had been made out yet. MIr. Rumpbreys said, he would meet that objeclion by indicting the prisoners in two different ways. The prisoners were then remanded and bail refused. BOw-STTREET.-An elderlv man of decent appearance, who gave the name of Wiliam Stone, and described himself as a draper's salesman, was brought before ir. JARDINE, charged with uttering a forged U5.-note to Robert Alison, foreman at Messrs. Howitt's, drapers, High Helborn. Mr. JAPD1NE thought the circumstance that the prisoner had given, what he now admitted was not his present address, was a fact for a jury to consider. The case must go for trial. William Henrn and (leorge Wilson were committed for trial on a charge of stealin a gold wateb, vall,e 201., from the personof Mr. John A en, of Glazhrook, Lincolnshiree farnier, in the Mall in St. James's Park, in the crowd gathered on the occasion of Her Majesty's Drawing-room on Tunesday. Policeman Parsons, D 182, saw the prisoner Hearn snatch the watch from prosecutor's pocket and pass it to Wilson. He seized them both, and Wilson threw the watch away. It was uninjured, 6x6ept by the breaking of the ring to separate it froin the chain. Mr. Allen said he was not aware of his loss till his atten. tion was callec to it by Parseons, who he considered deserved not only great oredit but a substantial reward for his conduct. Hearn was discharged on Monday from a charge of pocket. picking not clearly niade out. They were conimitted for trial. MAR.LBoRor0us'8rsET.-- Dorcas Osborn, John Osborn, and Jane Henrick were charged vwith cnwilitting a murdeious assault on William Ward, engineer, 2, Belvidere. road. The complainant, a young man, entered the box to give aevidence. His face and head appeared shockirgly bruised wyd cut, his clothes were torn from his back, and his whole Aioearance indicative of hsaving been engaged in a long and deadly struggle. He said ho snet £ enrick, and was tak; by' her to G1, Norton-street. He gave a sovereign to the prisoner l)orcus Osborn, who he supposed kept the lsouse,'And told hor to get a butle of wie. The wine was brought, but si ohar,ge. HO asked for his change, if only ]Qs. or it, but he couLl cot get any- lmouy.

EIe put up his -arm to ward off the blows, otherwise his skull would .ave been beaten in. lts hand was much bruised, and a ring on hfs finger was bent by the blows with the poker. He managed to get to the street door, calling " Mlurder I Help I Police !" The prisoner Dorcas Osborn followed him. and pulled him back, in doing vwhich his coat wees nearlytorn into pieces. The prisoner John Osborn also laid of him and dragged hin into a room and clos& the door. He rushed to the window, threw it up, and eaated " Polioc I" several times. A constable belonging 'to the Londan and North-Western Rtailway came ijto the houe, but behaved shamefuUy, reftusing to take the charge. although the constable saw he was covered with blood. A sob having got about the house the people swore they vrould break open the door unless they re admitted. The door was at length opened, and several persons and some policemen came in, anxd then the gprisoners were taken into custody. Witness's head and body were cub and bruised in various places, and the violence he sos. tained was so great as to render him for some time insensible. A witness proved -hearing cries of "Murder P" and "Police!" come from No. 61, Norto2-street, a notorious house. He and others got round the door, and on threaten. ing to burst it open they were admitted. He saw the woman lenrick holding the complainant by the hair, and trying to throw him over tie banmsters. He also saw the woman strike the complainant. Police-constable Fishburn, S 3G4, went with another constable into the house, and saw the complainant covered with blood. He was bleeding from the mouth and head, and said he had been beaten with a poker. There was an inspector of the London and North-Western PRilway present, who said to him. "It's all right; there's no occasion for you to take any notice." Witness, however, took the three prisoners to the station-house. The female prisoners denied having assaluted the complainant, or that he had given any money for wine. They asserted that no poker was used at all, the injuries to the complainant's head having occurred from his falling downstairs in consequence of being intoxicated. Mr. BEADON said it was evident tbe complainant had been shockingly Mn-used. He must, however, have his wounds examined by a doctor to ascertain whether they had been inflicted with a poker or by a fall. The complainant was taken to the Middlesex Hospital, and his wo-unds were examined and dressed. The surgeon's certificate was to the effect that the wounds had been caused by a blunt instrument, and not by the head coming in contact with the stairs. Mr. Lewis, of Great Marlborough-street, cross-examined the complainant, and elicited that he had been drinking in the Haymarket and other places during the previous night. Met Henrick and went with her to Norton-street. Did not seize her by the hair of the head. Did not knock the other woman down nor stamp on her person. Did not hold his band against the woman's mouth to prevent her calling "Murder !" His own mouth was held by the women to stop his cries of "M Murder." The woman begged him to be qlet ; ofrered him money to say nothing, otherwsLe she s ould be ruined, as her house would be indicted. Did not strike the male prisoner-only puehed him back. Would swear he was struck with a poker by the male prisoner, and that he tried to wrench thA poker from the man's hands. Mr. BEADON decided on adjourning the case until Monday next. WESTMTNsTERs.-A man about 40 years of age, attired as a respectable countryman, who gave the name of Thomas Beeves, was finally examined, charged with committing a series of frauds upon Sir Arthur H. Elton, M.P., and other gentlemen. The depositions taken on the previous examinations had reference to Sir Arthur's case. The accused had gone to his town house, in Eaton-place, representing himself as the relieving officer of Walcot, Bath, pretended that he was in immediate want of 51. to pay the expenses of a child's emigration to Australia, the parents and rest of the family, named Adams, being sent out free. Sir Arthur informed him that he was not satisfied with his story, and detained him, upon which the prisoner endeavoured to force his way out of the house but he was prevented, and the opportune arrival at the moment of a gentleman from Bath, who vwas well acquainted with the "reheving officer," exposedthe fraud, and the accused was given into custody. The Rev. Mr. Skynner, incumbent of Rushdon, Herts, stated that on the 1st of June the prisoner came to his house, No. 2, Connaught-square, and represented himself as Thomas Cannon, acting overseer of Cottered, near Buntingford, Herts. He said the wife and fanily of a man named Godfrey were about to be sent out to Australia, and more money than he was provided with was unexpectedly required for the youngest child's conveyance, and unless he could immediately procure 2t. lOs. he must go down to Herts, and return again at once, as the family were to he on board ship that night. He said he had come up to town with his (the rev, gentleman's) curate, Mr. Gall, and would repay the money to him dirctly he gob hack into the country, and, believing his statement, prosecutor gave him the required Thomas Field, acting overseer of Cottered, proved the utter falsehood of the whole of the prisoner's statement. Mr. Robert Pryor, of 7, Old-square, Lincoln's-inn, barrister, preferred a third charge against the accused. In this ease the pretence used was that the prisoner was a builder, named Greves, of Hitchin, Herts, employed by Drosecutor's brother, who resides there, and was interested in the fate of a poor man named Adams, fast sinking under consumption, who, pending application to the hospital at Brompton for admission, would be turned out of his lodgings, which Mr. Pryor generously gave money to prevent. This fraud also having bean clearly proved, the prisoner, who made no defence, was committed for trial on all three SoUTHAVRAM-Elizabeth Musir and Catherine Munroe, two young women dressed in the most fashionable style were brought before Mr. SECKER, charged with stealing a purse containing two sovereigns, four alf-sovereigns, and 14s. from the person of Elizabeth Bromley, in Newingtoncauseway. Mr. SEcKEn asked if anything was known of the prisoners?l Dennis Clark, 103 M, said, he had known both of them for several months as the companions of notorious thieves infesting the Borough and the railway stations, and they lived with the worst of characters. Mr. SECKER asked him if he knew whether they had been convicted of picking pockets ? Clark replied in the negative. Mr. Solomon contended that, as there was no proof that they had committed a robbery, his worship must discharge them. Mr. SECitER observed, that there was quite sufficient evidence for him to convict them. therefore he should sentence each to three months' hard labour in the House of Correction. A mistake was made in the report of the two men for assaulting 231 and 183 M, which appeared in The Times of 3esterday. The sign of Mr. Bruce's house is the "George," and not the "Crown," as represented.
THE SJfOKE NUISANCE. TO THE EDITOR OF TEHE TIMES. Sir,-Yon were good enough last year to insert a letter of mine respecting the smoke nuisance. The only object I had in sending it was toshowthose gentlemen who had laboured to effect a publio good-in suppressing a growing nuisance and giving us citizens a better air to breathe-that they had not done it in vain; and I, being a gardener,aud having under my care a smaU portion of the vegetable world, it gave me an opportunity of seeing the good effect (perhaps sooner than others would do). But I must tell you in doing so I received a fair share of abuse, and was told to wait till next year, and then see if the garden continued to improve, stating it was an unprecedented year for folage all round London, and it was the favourable season, not the partial suppression of the smnoke nuisance. This I was obliged to hear, bet still I did not believe it, for I was quite satisfied by my own practical experience I was right. These and mnany other weak arguments against me have again caused mie to beg a small space to tell those parties " I was ri ht " I can this year boast of having 2,000 roses instead of 2 -a circumstance not seen in the Temnple-gardens for years past. Is it the cause of the favourable season again? I say, No. I never experienced a more trying spring in the city-a succession of dry, cold. easterly winds, and no rain. It's the good effect of getting rid of a public nuisance, or rather, a part of it. The whole of the garden plants are gradually improving in health and vigour; and, for the sake of us poor labounring olams, I trust our legislators will still persevere to a further suppression of this smoke nuisauce, as here are proofs of the good already done. The factories on the Surrey side are itil very bad at times; they don't continue all day as foraerly, but every half hou, or so they are terribly smoky, And then leave off a while. The river steamboats are renarkably good, I scarcely see the colonr of smoke from them, althouigh I watch them very closely. Yon can scarcely believe what a great difference there is in the appear. ance of the children who have orders to walk in the garden, o what used to be; and I thirik we are in duty bound to shank those gentlemen who have been the means of improving our smoky air. Trusting they will still further the good cause, T ant Ri, ;s ___ S. BROO?IE. Temploegardens. -

THE LATE CITY FRAUDS. TO THE EDITOi OF TaB TIMES. Sir,-On the 21st of April, 1856, we were first applied to by J. H. May, or his traveller, to do business with him. We found that he had a respectable warehouse, with his name on the door as agent to one of the first needle manufacturers, with whom we had transacted business since 1837. Oar purchase then was 1. 14s. with May, and we had three or four transactions with him between the 21st of April and the 21st of August, when our buyer, AIr. Burgess, who left us on the 12th of September, 156, received the following letter from J. H. May:- "1L Church-passage, Gresham-street, Aug. 21, 1856. Mr. Burgess,- Dear Sir,- Having received two lots of cambrio handkerchiefs to sell by tender at a discount off list prices, I should like you to call and look them through. Lot 1, amount 2551. 14s. Id.; Lot 2, amount 3561. 2s. 3d. " Yoars resDectfullv. ",J. . MAY." w e menaerect tor tiesegoods, Lot 1, 38 per cent. off; Lot 2, 37. per cent. off, cash. On the 25th of August we reeived the following reply:- " Mr. May informs Messrs. Meeking and Co. that their offer for Lot 1 being the best by 60 days' interest, is therefore accepted." We had several other transactions of a larger kind with May before the one in question, and without a doubt r suspicion on our minds, or on those of our buyers, that we were doing business with other than a respectable agent selling for his principal. We had not heard, nor h3d we reason to suspeet, that May had been insolvent, bankrupt, or that he had been otherwise than respectable. With regard to the price at which we bought the parcel of goods in question, we point to the correspondence given above as evidence of the fact that it was subject to a large redaction. Iadeed, Irish handkerohiefs offered through agents are mostly submitted at nominal prices. Referring thereto and to the evidence of Jurey, " that the market was completely glutted at that moment," we assert that fall value was given for the goods, looking at the largenessof the quantity, whicah had to be sold in bulk, and at the high valae of money at the time. In corroboration of the fact that the goods were taken round to the trade by other persons than Jurey or Mlay, and refased to be purchased, Mr. B:areby distinctly swore before the magistrate that Mr. Gorman, through Air. Faithful, another agent, offered the goods to the wholesale houses and found there was no sale for them, and that he (HIareby) afterwards took them round and was unsuccessful in the saiae way. As evidence that we were not alone in believing May respectable, we call your attention to the fact proved before the magistrate by a respectable manufacturer, Mr. S. MWCulloch, living at Lurgan, ia Ireland, who swore as follows:- " May has had goods from me since August last, amounting to between 1,0001. and 1,100., and I have been paid th: whole of that amount." We remain. Sir. Your obedient servantq. 62, liolborn-hi, June 23. C. MEEKING and Co.

MIIJTABY AND NAVAL INTELLIGENOg. the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Edward of Saxe Weimar, the Hereditary Prince of Saxe Meiningen and suite, visitel Aldershott yesterday, and reviewed the troops in the Long Valley. The following General Order was issued at Qaebeo on the 27th of May by Lieutenant-General W. Eyre:- " Her Majesty's 16th Regiment being about to embark for England, the Lieutenant-General commanding cannot alow this excellent regiment to depart without expressing to its commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Cockel, the offlcers, non-commissioned officers, and men, the high respect he entertains for their soldierlike conduct and bearing during the period they have been under his command. The Lieutenant General begs that the regiment will accept his best vishes for their honour and welfare, with the hope that 1hey may be again associated together in the service of their eountry." In consequence oE numerous complaints having been made by those troops who have recently received their discharge at Chatham-having been invalided home from regiments r erving in India-of their money not having been remitted them which they had been induced to deposit in the regimental savings-banks in India, an order has been forwarded to Lieutenant-Col onel H. Anderson, superintendent of the invalid depGt at Chatham, directing him to make a return to the Horse Guards of the names of the whole of the noncommissioned officers and men to whom sums are due, with the amount owing to each man. Many of the men, it appears, have as much as 1001. in the savings-bank of their regiment, and on lea ving India they were assared that the money would be forwarded to them to this country; but although they have now been some time in England, the sums, varying from 101. to 1001., have not yet been received. The following Indiamen have been taken up by the Hon. East India Company for the conveyance of troops from Chatham to join the head-quarters of their respective regiments serving in the Bengal, Bombay, and Madras presidencGes. The vessels are appointed to be ready at GraTesend to receive the troops on board between the 1st and 25th of July, viz. :-Bucephalus, July 1; EDenborough, July 8 Cressy, July 11; Bombay and Albuera, July 21; Blenheim, Octavia, and, Monarch, July 25. On Monday the Plymouth Royal Marines Light Infantry were inspected by Major-General Eden, assisted by Colonel Wesley, the Deputy Adjatant-General of the corps. The battalion wasformed in heavy marching order in the Bar. rack-square, Stonehouse, at 11 am., when a minute inspection was made of the arms, accoutrements, and necessaries, after which the barracks, regimental schooL &c., were visited. In the afternoon, the battalion, in review order, and consisting of 10 s*rong companies, paradedin the brickflields under the commandant of the division, Colonel Dwyer. The Major-GeneraL accompanied by the Deputy Adjutant-General and staff, arrived at the ground at 3.30, and was receivedby a general salute, after which the troops broke into open columns of companies and marcbhd past in slow time. The Major-General then directed a -variety of battalion and light infantry mancenvres to be performed, and at the conclusionpaid ColonelDwyer a well-merited complinment on the soldierlike appearance and steady bearing of the men under arms, and their rapid progress towards becoming one of the most effici ent light corps in Her Majesty's service. In the evening the Major-General and the heads of military departments were entertained by the officers in their messsoom. Dis Sardinian Majesty's frigate Des Genys, Captain Mellieliere, arrived at Falmouth on Monday last on her voyage from Genoa to Stockholm, and will take a Channel pilot before she proceeds. Many of the crew have the English Crimean medal. Colonel Douglas, Inspector of Militia, has been on duty in the west of England, and has examined the staffs of the three Devonshire regiments at their respective depots, He left Exeter on Monday, and on Tuesday visited the new depot of the South Devon Militia at Mutley-park, Plymouth, and minutely inspected every soldier, and made inquirier r. garding the merits of each and the qualiications of the drill-inspectors. The buglers were required to sound yarticular calls, and the drummers and fifers to play quick marches, &c. Captain and Adjutant Fisk then escorted the colonel to the armoury, in Russell-street, whence the stores and accoutrements have not yet been removed. In the afternoon n similar inspection of the Devon Artillery, under the command of Captain andAdjutant Lakin took place at Granby Barracks, Devonnort. On Wednesday, the 2d Rifles were visited at Launceston. Today the Raagers are to be examined at Bodmin, and tomorrow the Royal Miners Artillery at Truro. Colonel Douglas has expressed his satisfaction with the condition and progress of the militia in the west, and it is understood to be his intention on returning to the.Horse Guards to make _ome suggestions which will tend to the permanent improvement of this valuable branch of the service. The remaining portion of the six patent breech-loading guns, manufactured by Mr. Eastlake, of New York, have arrived at Woolwich Arsenal, and were yesterday hoisted on the wharf, an operation which, from their ponderons size, was a matter of difficulty. The form of the guns nearly resembles the shape of an drdinary sodawater bottle. They are 6i inch rifle bored to carry 32-pounder shot or shel. The weight of each gun separated from the breach is 12 tons, and together with the breech and gear, exclusive of the carriage, 17 tons. It will therefore be readily imagined that there was great difficulty in obtaining ropes of sufficient strength to land these unusual cargoes. They were, however, landed without accident, further than the destruction of an immense quantity of rope and timber incapable of supporting the heavy strain. The freight ship Panthes hAs shipped 20 Russian guns of wvaious calibre from Woolwich Arsenal for Montreal, and is ready for sea The Storm of the Ocean, a full rigged ship of coniderable tonnage, is ordered down to Woolwich to embark a heavy cargo of ammunition and war stores for Hongkong. The freight-ship Isle of France is taking on board sundry ordnance stores from the military store department of Woolwich, for Graham's Town, which are being conveyed in lighters for shipment in the London Docks. The freight-ship Janus, also in the docks, is shipping military stores from Woolwich Arsenal for Bermuda. The freight-ship Ion, in the London Docks, is also receiving military stores from Woolwich for Qaebec; and the freight-ship Spitfire is filling in her magazines with ammunition from the floating stores off Woolwich Arsenal for Prince Edward's Island. The military store steam-transport Balaklava, Captain W. Pellatt, has been docked on a spacious platform alongside the Arsenal-wharf at Woolwich, where she is undergoingathorough overhaul, andwilishipanew screw propeller to replace her former one, damaged and broken on entering Portsmouth harbour. She is under orders to proceed to Hull, to embark camp equipage for Woolwich. The steam troop-ship Dee, Master-Commander Pollen, arrived at Woolwich yesterday morning, and was taken into basin to receive boilers and steam gear for Her Majesty's 101 screwsteamshipDonegal, andthe 51screwsteam-frigate;nder construction at Devonport. The paddle-wheel steam-vessel Otter, Lieutenant-Commander John H. Glover, arrived at Woolwich yesterday, having on board a number of Marines of the Woolwich division lately serving on oard Her Majesty's 90-gan screw steamship Exmouth. The Otter had likewise in tow a lighter barge for the purpose of conveying the store boilers destined for the Rattler (recently broken up) for service on board the paddle-wheel steamer Salamander, at Sheerness.
STEAM TO NEW YORK.-SouTHAeiON, Wednesday.-The European and American Company steamshio Queen of the South, Captain Beale, sailed for New York this afternoon, witth 260 passengers, a ship letter mail, and 380 tons of miscellaneous cargo. MA.ny, QnnmX OF Scovs.-The AArchsolog-ical Institute of Greawt Britain and Ire3and, anxious to oblain and disseminate knowledge respecting the personal appearance of Mary, Queen of Scots, gave notice of its anxiety to every reputed owner of an authentic portrait within the limits of the three kingdoms. The expressed wish received becoming attention. Her Majesty, the Dake of Northumberland, the Dake of Norfolk, the Dakeof Richmond, Earl Warwick, Viscount Duncan, and many other persons lent their property to the institution, and the consequence is that more than a hundred paintings and engravings of the illfated Mary Stuart now adorn the walls of the Archebological apartments, sitate at No. 26, Suffolk-strcet, Pall Mail, East. The first effect of this large collection of portraitsall authentic, mind-is to plunge the spectator into a state of scepticism, for the only point on which they all agree isthat Mary Stuart had a face of some sort orother. However, when he has recovered from the shock occasioned by the first subversion of aU belief he may usefna3y make inquiries as to the pedigrees of the various pictures, and draw his conclusions accordingly. But, whatever those conclusions may be-whether his investigations lead him to determine in favour of the aquiline nose or the snub-we advise him to keep his convictions to himself,till he is beyond the precincts of the institution. Several score of persons, for the most part high in rank, are flattering themselves that a genuine portrait of the Queen of Scots is among their nmost valued possessions, and he that would disturb that belief must put up witb the consequences. Indeed, Boccacio's novel of the " three rings " may be read with yrofit by aU persons who intend a visit to the galery. hanks are certainly due to all the owners of the pictures for their contribution towards an assemblage of so many curious works, which, whatever may be their value as portraits, compriso several remarkable specimens of early schools of art. Pictures of FraDcis IL, Earl Darnley, and other persons who figure in the history of hlary Stnart enhance tho interest of the collecticnsnd, in addition to the pictorial works, there are In elaborately enamelled pix of the 12th century, and a curious rosary, formerly belouging to the Queen of Scots, ;rs well as theveil worn by ber at her execution. On Tuesday the collection was inspected by Prince Albert, who is patron of the soniety, and the Prince of IPrussia. The exhi- ition is strictly private, but adm.issions are to be olWtahned (gratis) on application to Messrs. zJ,lnaghi or Messrs. brre, PaU.Ial1. It will reainsil opea till thei 4th of dlu]y,

Now, it appears that Chariton had weighed for Merlin, but the horse did not reach the course untU within a fevv minutes of the time set for the stsrt. The owner of the horse therefore objected to the race, on the ground that it had been rUn a quarter of an hour before the time, and at 4 o'lock he caused his horse to walk over the course and then claimed the stake.L The stewards immediately inves. tigated the case, and after a most protracted discussion, decided that the first teat was " no raceo, and that all bets on it were void.

THE SCREW STEAMEB CAXrADIAN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-On behalf of the passengers of tho North American screw steamer Canadian, who were wrclked in the St. Lawrence on the morning of Monday, the 1st of June, I have to request the use of a gmall space in The Times in acknowledgment of the Jdnd attention and able assistance afforded us y Captain David Store, of the bark Eden, of London. He received on board about 300 steerage and cabin passengers; notwithstanding his own vessel was leaky, and that, after beating about with head winds for several days, he had at Last caught a favourable breeze, he hesitated not to lay to and give us every assistance, much valuable time having been lost by the tirst number of steerage passengers refusing to go on board the bark, and by their returning to the Canadian with the tug. By inserting this you wil pay a well-merited compliment to Captain Store, and greatly oblige those who were passengers on board the ill-fated though excellent steamer. I sm. S;r mran- nh,.Mo,d o^ -EDWARD TWINING. .Uontre4, JTun 5. TO THE EDITOR OF THIE TIMES. Sir,-I believe I am fulfilling the wish of all the passengers of the unfortunate Canadian (which struck on the Avignon rocok in the St. Lawrence, on the 1st of June) in availing myself of your columns to express our feelings of atitude to Captain Store (or Storey), of the Eden, of Lndon, who received us on board his ship and brought us to Quebec. His kind attention to all, and his efforts to render his 300 ad odd unexpected guests as oomfortable as possible under the circumstances, merit more than this expression of our gratitude.
